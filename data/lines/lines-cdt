- We said goodbye.
- After you plowed her?
- We had break-up sex, all right?
- "Break-up sex"?
Never heard of it.
Yeah.
You have sex, and then that's it.
You say goodbye.
That's the only kind of sex I have.
- Hey, homey.
- What's up?
- You look like you just rolled out of bed.
- Yeah, I did.
You're gonna wear that shirt?
No, it's wrinkled.
I'm gonna wear this one.
- You got style, bro.
- Looks good!
We got a good show tonight.
All right, from the movie, The Big Bounce...
Sara Foster, here, tonight!
Heard a lot about this.
This movie everybody's talking about... the movie, Head On, the star of it, Vincent Chase, here, tonight!
- Where are the suits?
- Right here, baby.
Shauna, don't tell Kimmel I'm here.
'Cause he and I have some issues.
Yeah, mum's the word, Drama.
Don't tell me you made notes.
Only one.
- Home Video Solutions.
- Yes.
You guys go to the green room.
I'm gonna take Vince to makeup.
- Where is it?
- That way.
Vince, extra concealer.
That's the key under house lights.
- Good luck, buddy.
- Go get them, baby!
I don't know about the afterlife, but this life is sweet.
- Shall we?
- We shall.
This is bad.
What?
- I never called you.
- Please.
I never called you.
- Really?
- Really.
Yeah, well, I still feel bad.
I feel worse, trust me.
You look incredible.
You, too.
Come in.
Close the door.
You know me, Shauna.
I like to play the field.
Keep my options open.
When I settle down, it's gonna be forever.
Weren't you married once already?
Nine days.
It was annulled.
Next time.
- Ari's late.
- Good.
- I'm early.
- Good.
Hey, guys.
- You smoke?
- Cigarettes?
Yeah, I've been trying to quit recently.
- How hard are you trying?
- Not that hard.
Good.
- I thought he quit?
- Cigarettes, not pussy.
Ready in five.
We need 10.
I've tried everything.
I tried the patch.
It left a yellow stain on my arm.
- I know.
Me, too.
- Have you ever tried Nicorette?
I did, I tried it, but I couldn't follow the instructions.
I never thought chewing gum could be so complicated.
I even tried smoking only when drinking coffee.
Me, too, I started drinking 25 cups a day.
I went to a hypnotist, cost $500.
- How did that go?
- It went pretty good... until I saw a pair of shoes that I could've bought.
I started smoking again.
But this time I'm quitting for sure.
- For sure.
- Yeah.
Me, too.
Wanna share one more?
Let's share one more.
Definitely.
What kind of a guy do you go out with?
What do you look for in a man?
Honestly, just a regular, nice guy... like yourself!
Tell him I don't represent talent.
I represent temperature, and he's not hot.
Sarah Silverman.
Hi.
- Ari Gold, hi.
- Nice to meet you.
- We've met before.
- No, I know...
They're booking hip people here.
Now, that's cool.
No, I'm not on the show tonight.
That's even hipper.
Cool people hanging out.
That's awesome.
That's cool.
Right.
I'm here representing my boy, Vinny Chase.
Are you going to the green room?
No, I'm not going in.
I got banned from that fucking place.
- Really?
- Yeah, it's ridiculous.
I had a little situation with Natalie Portman's father.
Stupid.
- It was a weird situation.
- I'll sneak you in.
Wanna go in with me?
Like we go in together?
You and me together?
Like, we're going in at the same time.
All right, but are we going to be leaving together is what I'm saying.
That's so scum-baggy.
I know you're married.
- I take Krav Maga with your wife.
- I know you do.
I'm not trying to fuck you, Sarah.
I'm trying to sign you.
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.
You're a funny girl.
I mean, you know... you do the ass jokes and stuff, I enjoy it.
What's the problem?
I'll be out in a second.
I'm sorry, I'll have to ask you not to hold hands.
The FCC says no overt displays of affection.
So...
If you could just separate them.
Thank you.
We just had sex about five minutes ago.
That's another...
- Is that okay?
- No, you could be arrested for that.
- So wrong!
- We're on the lam now.
It's wrong.
So, let's talk about the movie.
It comes out this weekend, right?
- I don't want to talk about it.
- You don't want to talk about it?
It's a mystery.
I wouldn't want to give it away.
I'm not here to plug anything.
I'm here to see you.
Well, thank you.
What about me?
- And you, of course.
- He's so full of it.
It's unbelievable.
So, we have a clip of the film.
And you need to set the clip up?
Forget about the clip.
All right, we'll forget about the clip.
Look, the movie's called Head On.
It's a cool movie, see it this weekend.
You're guaranteed to love it, or your money back.
- From the studio.
Not from me.
- Yeah.
Right.
What would you like to talk about then?
I'll let you decide.
Well, why don't we talk about my brother?
He's really pissed.
He says you dissed him, you owe him a phone call.
- So you know what happened?
- I know what he told me.
I can't believe he's not talking about the movie.
- Get ready for some lies.
- He's going to run out of time.
How is he gonna work Home Video Solutions into this?
Would you shut up and listen?
What did he tell you?
He said that when he hit a rough patch, you kind of bailed on him... and you never called him again.
He did not...
He said I bailed on him?
I was like a bounty hunter trying to get a hold of him.
I called his house.
I looked for his address.
He owes me a call.
I think he might be right.
He's backstage.
Who?
He is?
Is he really?
Johnny Drama's backstage?
Bring him out.
Because I'd love to clear this up.
Is he around?
Is he really backstage?
- Come on.
Go.
- Go!
What's wrong with you?
Get out there!
Do I need makeup?
The great Johnny Drama!
- Maybe I did owe you a call, buddy.
- That's all right.
Johnny Drama, everybody!
Isn't that classic?
- How do I look?
I look pretty good?
- You do look thin.
- Thin?
I look lean.
- That's what I meant.
No body fat.
You guys are living together now?
It's a bachelor pad?
What's the setup over there?
- Tell them about the home theater.
- Yeah.
So, we have this really great house.
And it's got everything.
- Except...
- Except... a home theater.
But we've been told that Rufus at Home Video Solutions is the best in the business.
Here you go!
- To Drama.
- To Drama.
Great night.
Great fucking night.
Lights Out, it's Johnny Drama!
What's up, man?
You see that?
He recognized me.
$3 million for eight rounds!
It's unreal.
You gotta make a movie to make that much.
Are you crazy?
Did you see that guy's face?
No amount of money's gonna get me in the ring.
$50,000, I'd let Klitschko beat the fuck out of me.
I'll beat the fuck out of you for free.
What do you think?
I'm telling you, Klitschko don't hit that hard, man.
You kidding?
The guy's Russian.
He's got that Mongolian Genghis Khan warrior blood in him.
I'd do three shots of Stoli and let him blast away.
You fucking dick.
You'd be a dead man.
Yeah, but I'd be flush.
I tell you, I'd let that hit me for free...
- Fuck off, asshole.
- It was him.
- Relax.
- He didn't mean that.
- Hi, Vince.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Good.
I'm Johnny.
Let's go to the bar.
- Let's see.
What do you guys want?
- Beer, baby.
What did you think of the seats?
- Amazing.
- Two very slow white men.
I apologize.
But goddamn, there was some blood.
- You liked the blood?
- Loved it.
That was for you.
If you see Rob Schneider, tell him you bought those seats.
What do you want to drink?
Listen.
Three tequilas would be great, all right?
- Cheers!
- Good for what ails you.
Yes!
- Jimmy!
Jimmy Kimmel!
- How you doing?
You know Vincent Chase, right?
- Yeah, how are you?
- There you go.
- What's happening?
- Big fan.
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
We should get you on the show.
- Yeah.
I'd love to do it, anytime.
- I'd love to have you.
Like tomorrow, we'd love to have you if we could.
I don't know, you're putting me on the spot.
I know you got the movie.
- You got a movie coming out Friday.
- It can't hurt.
All right, fuck it.
See you tomorrow.
- There you go, he's in!
- All right.
I'll call you, then?
- Absolutely.
- Very good.
Thanks, Ari.
Pleased to meet you.
I can't.
I don't drink.
I'm sorry.
I do drink.
- Say hello to your brother for me, too.
- Johnny?
Tell him I said hi.
I haven't seen him in a long time.
- He's around here somewhere.
- See you, Jimmy.
There you go.
You're in.
So, I got this guy, Rufus.
He's got this company called Home Video Solutions.
He just installed this sweet little home system... in my place on Mulholland.
State-of-the art everything.
I could charge admission at this place.
- Really?
- I'm not kidding you.
Here's the kicker:
I mention Rufus' name in InStyle.
All he charges me for is installation.
- Fuck you!
- No.
Fuck you, seriously.
Rufus, that's how he does it.
He's a wild cat, Rufus.
I got his card here somewhere.
I'd love that.
You still doing that thing with Wes?
Yeah.
We're gonna start shooting in June.
Did you get anyone to play the part of the partner?
Yeah.
Unfortunately, my brother's gonna do it.
He's costly.
If he falls out, you think of me, right?
Always.
Always thinking of you, Johnny Drama.
- Thanks a lot, Luke.
I appreciate it.
- Call Rufus.
Vince, you gonna prepare anything for the show?
No.
That would take all the fun out of just winging it.
The guy's gonna ask you a lot of questions.
Yeah, it's Jimmy Kimmel.
Not 60 Minutes, bro.
All right, you'll see.
You should have some stories ready.
Hey, ladies.
You got any stories I can tell on Jimmy Kimmel?
You know what?
The night's still young.
The night is young.
- Taste this.
- I am not tasting that, it stinks.
- What the fuck is it?
- It's a new recipe.
Tofu spirulina scramble, it's delicious.
Taste it.
It smells like dog shit scramble.
Eat your Froot Loops and shut up.
- What the fuck smells?
- Open a window, Drama.
Jesus Christ!
You know what?
Kitchen's closed, fellas.
Enjoy cold cereal.
- So, you want to talk about Kimmel?
- Jimmy Kimmel?
- Vince is doing the show tonight.
- Fuck Jimmy Kimmel.
- You're angrier than usual this morning.
- Jimmy Kimmel's a prick.
Why?
He said to say hello to you.
He's a phony prick.
He and I were running buddies back in the day.
That was before I got kicked off of Melrose Place.
The money ran dry.
I lost my house.
I had to move into that motel on Wilcox.
After that, that was it.
He dropped me like a bad habit.
Never heard from the guy again.
I never heard that story.
Well, you know me.
I don't like to advertise.
- Cancel on the prick, Vince.
- He can't cancel.
- I can't cancel.
- What are you gonna talk about, though?
E., it's a talk show.
They ask you questions.
You answer them.
"What's up?" "Not much." "How you feeling?" "Pretty good."
Don't forget about the time you tanked on Regis and Kelly.
That was a morning show.
We pulled an all-nighter.
Plus, who could focus... with hot-ass Kelly Ripa up there interrogating you?
- So, what's really bothering you, E?
- What?
Are you really concerned about me, or is this maybe a Kristen issue?
- Yep.
- Don't tell me Kristen's back in the game.
Fuck off.
She's picking up her shit later today.
That's all.
I offered to help him box it up and send it off.
But he didn't want that.
Throw her shit in the garbage and change your number.
Yeah.
She comes down here, you're out of commission for two weeks.
I can't have that.
Broken up and still pussy-whipped.
That's just sad.
These guys are right.
You lose control around that girl.
You guys don't know dick.
You never had a relationship.
You never ended one.
The only person you've ever loved is yourself.
What's not to love?
Look, breaking up is painful.
That's why I never do it.
Why hurt someone when you can just let it drag on forever?
Come on.
You must've broken up with someone.
- No, Johnny.
Nobody.
- Bullshit!
What about Becky Serrano in junior high?
I remember, she was crying by the lockers.
I never broke up with Becky.
I liked her too much for that.
No, you just started banging Meredith Tierney at the same time.
Yeah.
I liked her, too.
I don't know how you get away with this shit.
Lucky guy.
Vince, I was talking to Luke Wilson last night.
He's got this phat home theater.
I think we should make a play for one.
- You couldn't call me?
- It happened last night.
There's a right way to do things and a wrong way to do things.
- And which one was this?
- Don't make a plan without consulting me.
You don't circumvent the system.
There are consequences.
Is he gonna get killed for going on Kimmel?
- You might get killed for being an asshole.
- Shauna.
If you want to do Kimmel, come to me.
I'm your publicist.
That's what I'm here for.
I gave him the idea for The Man Show.
He loves my ass.
- Come here with that neck.
- Cut that shit out.
Look, I'm serious.
You don't want to piss off Letterman or Leno.
- You don't want to piss off Shauna.
- I think she's looks kind of sexy, pissed.
I am.
But those guys are vindictive pricks.
Here, try this on.
- I'm sorry, okay?
Do you forgive me?
- Have you ever even seen the show?
- What?
Jimmy Kimmel?
- Yeah.
I don't know.
Maybe.
What's the difference?
He's not asking me to watch it.
He's asking to be on it.
I think he should go with Byblos.
If he decides later he doesn't like it, I'll take it.
Have to let the shoulders out a bit.
You should get a few suits to choose from, so you're not locked into one.
- He doesn't wear suits.
- He does now.
He gets them for free, you cheap fuck.
- That's a keeper.
- Nice.
Hello.
- You should get me on a talk show.
I'd kill.
- I'll get you on Springer.
Fat, little horny fucks, and the women that despise them.
What are you laughing at?
Maybe I'll get you on Montel with Don Swayze...
Joey Travolta and the other retarded star siblings.
- That's funny.
- Kimmel's girl just called.
- They're calling back in an hour.
- You're gonna have to do that, E.
It's gonna get my head screwed up.
I gotta keep my spontaneity.
Fuck spontaneity.
Well-dressed, well-prepared.
That's what makes you a star.
You wanna write that down for me in case I forget?
Yeah.
Try this one on, all right?
Yeah, that could be funny.
The script pages got all switched.
The director got confused.
- Everybody really laughed about it.
- Boring.
Then they fixed it.
Yeah, I guess you had to be there.
What else?
Tell him about that stoned-out craft service girl who blew me after lunch.
- Why don't you stop it, Drama?
- I'm trying to help.
You're embarrassing me.
I was on Arsenio.
It never aired.
'Cause he got cancelled, but I was good.
Let's see.
Here's something.
I got one.
Vince went to the High School of Performing Arts where they shot Fame.
But he never saw the movie or the TV Show.
I always found that kind of funny.
Maybe not funny, but ironic at least.
I don't know.
Hold on a second.
You want to do this?
This is your interview.
I've never done this before.
I don't know what to say.
You're doing a good job.
Yeah.
Vince actually...
He's not available right now.
I'll talk to him and see if we can come up with something.
I'll call you later, okay?
Thank you.
Man, you're really bombing, bro.
Maybe we should just cancel.
No.
Don't even cancel.
Just don't show.
That'll really fuck Kimmel.
You'd never cancel.
Why would I cancel when it's so much fun to watch him freak?
You're gonna freak.
Sara Foster is also on the show tonight.
Shit.
You serious?
- You're fucking dead!
- Fuck you, baby!
Yo, Turtle!
I'm not walking.
Sara Foster?
That chick is hot.
You think she'll bring other hotties with her?
- Why would she?
- 'Cause hotties roll in packs, baby.
I never broke up with her, either.
We had that crazy night in the Hamptons.
I never called her again.
I'm not proud of that.
But that's not breaking up.
See?
My record's intact.
No asterisk there.
What are you gonna say to her?
What do you mean, what am I...
I'm not planning anything.
- What I say when I see her is what I'll say.
- What about Kristen, E?
Same thing.
Whatever I say when I see her is what I'll say.
Bullshit.
He's gonna cry like a little bitch.
Cry like a little bitch.
Why are you using Vince as a defense...
Run, Forrest, run!
You look great.
Thanks.
I'm probably in the best shape of my life.
- You look like shit.
- I do?
Yeah, who's been cutting your hair?
Turtle?
No, I just haven't...
- Still doing the Pilates?
- When I have time.
I'm really busy.
Yeah, me, too.
Real busy.
Got no time for anything.
No time for haircuts.
Got a lot of shit going on right now.
- Like what?
- Stuff.
- Really, like what?
- Like stuff.
Don't quiz me.
What did you do today?
You don't get my job, you never did.
I shopped and I played golf.
But it's not how it sounds.
Shopping and golf?
Vince is doing Jimmy Kimmel tonight.
I've got to keep his mind focused.
He's on with Sara Foster.
You know who that is?
They had a one-night stand and he never called her.
Can you believe that?
I can.
Vince has to break up with girls before it gets serious.
That way he can't get hurt.
Textbook narcissist.
He has major intimacy issues.
- You think that's what it is?
- I'm a Psych major, Eric.
Turtle tells me you're thinking of buying a house.
Not exactly.
Of course.
Vince is gonna buy a house, and you're all gonna live in it.
Yeah.
Something like that.
- Fuck.
- What?
What happened to you getting your own place?
- I am getting my own place.
- When?
When Vince dies?
When the time is right.
Jesus!
What?
Can't this wait?
It's in the second drawer.
Jesus!
- Vince says hello.
- Great.
Look, I gotta go.
I was hoping we weren't going to fight about this.
- I thought you like to fight.
- Only when it leads to make-up sex.
That's not gonna happen.
Wait.
Let's be clear about one thing, okay?
- This isn't make-up sex.
It's break-up sex.
- Whatever.
This fucking place is a shithole.
This can't be the place.
It looks like a dump.
Luke Wilson's system was in the neighborhood of $190,000.
$190,000?
- Can't you do any better?
- No, I can't.
I didn't want to have to bring this up, all right?
- I work for a fairly prominent movie star.
- Yeah.
Who?
- Vincent Chase.
- Really?
He's great.
Maybe you recognize me.
I'm his brother.
No.
Anyway, off the record, my man is doing Jimmy Kimmel tonight.
- All right.
- What if we threw in a plug for your outfit?
Would that be cool?
Would that be worth something?
I'll tell you what.
You deliver on that promise, I give you half off.
But if he wears this hat... it's free.
So all he has to do is wear the hat?
- Check this out.
- She's sweet.
Yeah.
She's gonna be naked in a second.
So, now what?
You wanna go to dinner tomorrow night?
Talk about all this?
Eric, you're really not getting this concept.
This was break-up sex, for real.
So, what, you just had sex with me as a goodbye?
Yeah.
It was great.
- I feel dirty.
- Take a shower.
- Tie or no tie?
- No tie.
- What do you know?
- Where are you guys going, church?
- Gotta look nice for the ladies.
- Vince, come on.
We're gonna be late.
- What ladies?
- Kimmel's green room.
We hear it's stocked like a trout pond.
So, how'd it go with Kristen?
- We said goodbye.
- After you plowed her?
- We had break-up sex, all right?
- "Break-up sex"?
Never heard of it.
Yeah.
You have sex, and then that's it.
You say goodbye.
That's the only kind of sex I have.
- Hey, homey.
- What's up?
- You look like you just rolled out of bed.
- Yeah, I did.
You're gonna wear that shirt?
No, it's wrinkled.
I'm gonna wear this one.
- You got style, bro.
- Looks good!
We got a good show tonight.
All right, from the movie, The Big Bounce...
Sara Foster, here, tonight!
Heard a lot about this.
This movie everybody's talking about... the movie, Head On, the star of it, Vincent Chase, here, tonight!
- Where are the suits?
- Right here, baby.
Shauna, don't tell Kimmel I'm here.
'Cause he and I have some issues.
Yeah, mum's the word, Drama.
Don't tell me you made notes.
Only one.
- Home Video Solutions.
- Yes.
You guys go to the green room.
I'm gonna take Vince to makeup.
- Where is it?
- That way.
Vince, extra concealer.
That's the key under house lights.
- Good luck, buddy.
- Go get them, baby!
I don't know about the afterlife, but this life is sweet.
- Shall we?
- We shall.
This is bad.
What?
- I never called you.
- Please.
I never called you.
- Really?
- Really.
Yeah, well, I still feel bad.
I feel worse, trust me.
You look incredible.
You, too.
Come in.
Close the door.
You know me, Shauna.
I like to play the field.
Keep my options open.
When I settle down, it's gonna be forever.
Weren't you married once already?
Nine days.
It was annulled.
Next time.
- Ari's late.
- Good.
- I'm early.
- Good.
Hey, guys.
- You smoke?
- Cigarettes?
Yeah, I've been trying to quit recently.
- How hard are you trying?
- Not that hard.
Good.
- I thought he quit?
- Cigarettes, not pussy.
Ready in five.
We need 10.
I've tried everything.
I tried the patch.
It left a yellow stain on my arm.
- I know.
Me, too.
- Have you ever tried Nicorette?
I did, I tried it, but I couldn't follow the instructions.
I never thought chewing gum could be so complicated.
I even tried smoking only when drinking coffee.
Me, too, I started drinking 25 cups a day.
I went to a hypnotist, cost $500.
- How did that go?
- It went pretty good... until I saw a pair of shoes that I could've bought.
I started smoking again.
But this time I'm quitting for sure.
- For sure.
- Yeah.
Me, too.
Wanna share one more?
Let's share one more.
Definitely.
What kind of a guy do you go out with?
What do you look for in a man?
Honestly, just a regular, nice guy... like yourself!
Tell him I don't represent talent.
I represent temperature, and he's not hot.
Sarah Silverman.
Hi.
- Ari Gold, hi.
- Nice to meet you.
- We've met before.
- No, I know...
They're booking hip people here.
Now, that's cool.
No, I'm not on the show tonight.
That's even hipper.
Cool people hanging out.
That's awesome.
That's cool.
Right.
I'm here representing my boy, Vinny Chase.
Are you going to the green room?
No, I'm not going in.
I got banned from that fucking place.
- Really?
- Yeah, it's ridiculous.
I had a little situation with Natalie Portman's father.
Stupid.
- It was a weird situation.
- I'll sneak you in.
Wanna go in with me?
Like we go in together?
You and me together?
Like, we're going in at the same time.
All right, but are we going to be leaving together is what I'm saying.
That's so scum-baggy.
I know you're married.
- I take Krav Maga with your wife.
- I know you do.
I'm not trying to fuck you, Sarah.
I'm trying to sign you.
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.
You're a funny girl.
I mean, you know... you do the ass jokes and stuff, I enjoy it.
What's the problem?
I'll be out in a second.
I'm sorry, I'll have to ask you not to hold hands.
The FCC says no overt displays of affection.
So...
If you could just separate them.
Thank you.
We just had sex about five minutes ago.
That's another...
- Is that okay?
- No, you could be arrested for that.
- So wrong!
- We're on the lam now.
It's wrong.
So, let's talk about the movie.
It comes out this weekend, right?
- I don't want to talk about it.
- You don't want to talk about it?
It's a mystery.
I wouldn't want to give it away.
I'm not here to plug anything.
I'm here to see you.
Well, thank you.
What about me?
- And you, of course.
- He's so full of it.
It's unbelievable.
So, we have a clip of the film.
And you need to set the clip up?
Forget about the clip.
All right, we'll forget about the clip.
Look, the movie's called Head On.
It's a cool movie, see it this weekend.
You're guaranteed to love it, or your money back.
- From the studio.
Not from me.
- Yeah.
Right.
What would you like to talk about then?
I'll let you decide.
Well, why don't we talk about my brother?
He's really pissed.
He says you dissed him, you owe him a phone call.
- So you know what happened?
- I know what he told me.
I can't believe he's not talking about the movie.
- Get ready for some lies.
- He's going to run out of time.
How is he gonna work Home Video Solutions into this?
Would you shut up and listen?
What did he tell you?
He said that when he hit a rough patch, you kind of bailed on him... and you never called him again.
He did not...
He said I bailed on him?
I was like a bounty hunter trying to get a hold of him.
I called his house.
I looked for his address.
He owes me a call.
I think he might be right.
He's backstage.
Who?
He is?
Is he really?
Johnny Drama's backstage?
Bring him out.
Because I'd love to clear this up.
Is he around?
Is he really backstage?
- Come on.
Go.
- Go!
What's wrong with you?
Get out there!
Do I need makeup?
The great Johnny Drama!
- Maybe I did owe you a call, buddy.
- That's all right.
Johnny Drama, everybody!
Isn't that classic?
- How do I look?
I look pretty good?
- You do look thin.
- Thin?
I look lean.
- That's what I meant.
No body fat.
You guys are living together now?
It's a bachelor pad?
What's the setup over there?
- Tell them about the home theater.
- Yeah.
So, we have this really great house.
And it's got everything.
- Except...
- Except... a home theater.
But we've been told that Rufus at Home Video Solutions is the best in the business.
Here you go!
- To Drama.
- To Drama.
Great night.
Great fucking night.

He recognized me.

$3 million for eight rounds!
It's unreal.
You gotta make a movie to make that much.
Are you crazy?
Did you see that guy's face?
No amount of money's gonna get me in the ring.
$50,000, I'd let Klitschko beat the fuck out of me.
I'll beat the fuck out of you for free.
What do you think?
I'm telling you, Klitschko don't hit that hard, man.
You kidding?
The guy's Russian.
He's got that Mongolian Genghis Khan warrior blood in him.
I'd do three shots of Stoli and let him blast away.
- (GRUNTING)
- Ow, you fucking dick.
You'd be a dead man.
Yeah, but I'd be flush.
I tell you, I'd let that hit me for free...
- Fuck off, asshole.
- It was him.
- Relax.
- He didn't mean that.
- Hi, Vince.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Good.
I'm Johnny.

(CAMERA CLICKING)
ERIC:
Let's go to the bar.
(PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
ERIC:
Let's see.
What do you guys want?
DRAMA:
Beer, baby.
What did you think of the seats?
- Amazing.
- Two very slow white men.
I apologize.
But goddamn, there was some blood.
- You liked the blood?
- Loved it.
That was for you.
If you see Rob Schneider, tell him you bought those seats.
What do you want to drink?
(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
Listen.
Three tequilas would be great, all right?
- Cheers!
- Good for what ails you.
Ah, yes!
- Jimmy!
Jimmy Kimmel!
- JIMMY:
How you doing?
You know Vincent Chase, right?
- Yeah, how are you?
- There you go.
- What's happening?
- Big fan.
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
We should get you on the show.
- Yeah.
I'd love to do it, anytime.
- I'd love to have you.
Like tomorrow, we'd love to have you if we could.
I don't know, you're putting me on the spot.
I know you got the movie.
- You got a movie coming out Friday.
- It can't hurt.
All right, fuck it.
See you tomorrow.
- There you go, he's in!
- All right.
I'll call you, then?
- Absolutely.
- Very good.
Thanks, Ari.
- VINCE:
Pleased to meet you.
- I can't.
I don't drink.
I'm sorry.
I do drink.
- Say hello to your brother for me, too.
- Johnny?
Tell him I said hi.
I haven't seen him in a long time.
- He's around here somewhere.
- See you, Jimmy.
There you go.
You're in.
So, I got this guy, Rufus.
He's got this company called Home Video Solutions.
He just installed this sweet little home system... in my place on Mulholland.
State-of-the art everything.
I could charge admission at this place.
- Really?
- I'm not kidding you.
Here's the kicker:
I mention Rufus' name in InStyle.
All he charges me for is installation.
- Fuck you!
- No.
Fuck you, seriously.
Rufus, that's how he does it.
He's a wild cat, Rufus.
I got his card here somewhere.
Ah, I'd love that.
You still doing that thing with Wes?
Yeah.
We're gonna start shooting in June.
Did you get anyone to play the part of the partner?
Yeah.
Unfortunately, my brother's gonna do it.
He's costly.
If he falls out, you think of me, right?
Always.
Always thinking of you, Johnny Drama.
- Thanks a lot, Luke.
I appreciate it.
- Call Rufus.
Vince, you gonna prepare anything for the show?
No.
That would take all the fun out of just winging it.
The guy's gonna ask you a lot of questions.
Yeah, it's Jimmy Kimmel.
Not 60 Minutes, bro.
All right, you'll see.
You should have some stories ready.
Hey, ladies.
You got any stories I can tell on Jimmy Kimmel?
You know what?
The night's still young.
The night is young.
(DOG BARKING)
- DRAMA:
Taste this.
- I am not tasting that, it stinks.
- What the fuck is it?
- It's a new recipe.
Tofu spirulina scramble, it's delicious.
Taste it.
It smells like dog shit scramble.
Eat your Froot Loops and shut up.
- What the fuck smells?
- Open a window, Drama.
Jesus Christ!
You know what?
Kitchen's closed, fellas.
Enjoy cold cereal.
- So, you want to talk about Kimmel?
- Jimmy Kimmel?
- ERIC:
Vince is doing the show tonight.
- Fuck Jimmy Kimmel.
ERIC:
You're angrier than usual this morning.
Jimmy Kimmel's a prick.
Why?
He said to say hello to you.
He's a phony prick.
He and I were running buddies back in the day.
That was before I got kicked off of Melrose Place.
The money ran dry.
I lost my house.
I had to move into that motel on Wilcox.
After that, that was it.
He dropped me like a bad habit.
Never heard from the guy again.
I never heard that story.
Well, you know me.
I don't like to advertise.
- Cancel on the prick, Vince.
- He can't cancel.
I can't cancel.
ERIC:
What are you gonna talk about, though?
E, it's a talk show.
They ask you questions.
You answer them.
"What's up?" "Not much." "How you feeling?" "Pretty good."
Don't forget about the time you tanked on Regis and Kelly.
That was a morning show.
We pulled an all-nighter.
Plus, who could focus with hot-ass Kelly Ripa up there interrogating you?
- So, what's really bothering you, E?
- ERIC:
What?
Are you really concerned about me, or is this maybe a Kristen issue?
Yep.
(LAUGHING) Don't tell me Kristen's back in the game.
Fuck off.
She's picking up her shit later today.
That's all.
I offered to help him box it up and send it off.
But he didn't want that.
TURTLE:
Throw her shit in the garbage and change your number.
Yeah.
She comes down here, you're out of commission for two weeks.
I can't have that.
(LAUGHING) Broken up and still pussy-whipped.
That's just sad.
These guys are right.
You lose control around that girl.
You guys don't know dick.
You never had a relationship.
You never ended one.
The only person you've ever loved is yourself.
What's not to love?
Look, breaking up is painful.
That's why I never do it.
Why hurt someone when you can just let it drag on forever?
DRAMA:
Come on.
You must've broken up with someone.
- No, Johnny.
Nobody.
- Bullshit!
What about Becky Serrano in junior high?
I remember, she was crying by the lockers.
I never broke up with Becky.
I liked her too much for that.
No, you just started banging Meredith Tierney at the same time.
Yeah.
I liked her, too.
I don't know how you get away with this shit.
Lucky guy.
TURTLE:
Vince, I was talking to Luke Wilson last night.
He's got this phat home theater.
I think we should make a play for one.
SHAUNA:
You couldn't call me?
ERIC:
It happened last night.
There's a right way to do things and a wrong way to do things.
- And which one was this?
- Don't make a plan without consulting me.
You don't circumvent the system.
There are consequences.
TURTLE:
Is he gonna get killed for going on Kimmel?
- You might get killed for being an asshole.
- Shauna.
If you want to do Kimmel, come to me.
I'm your publicist.
That's what I'm here for, and that's what I do.
I gave him the idea for The Man Show.
He loves my ass.
- Come here with that neck.
- Cut that shit out.
Look, I'm serious.
You don't want to piss off Letterman or Leno.
- You don't want to piss off Shauna.
- I think she's looks kind of sexy, pissed.
I am.
But those guys are vindictive pricks.
Here, try this on.
- I'm sorry, okay?
Do you forgive me?
- Have you ever even seen the show?
- What?
Jimmy Kimmel?
- Yeah.
I don't know.
Maybe.
What's the difference?
He's not asking me to watch it.
He's asking to be on it.
DRAMA:
I think he should go with Byblos.
If he decides later he doesn't like it, I'll take it.
Have to let the shoulders out a bit.
You should get a couple suits to choose from, so you're not locked into one.
- He doesn't wear a couple suits.
- He does now.
He gets them for free, you cheap fuck.
- That's a keeper.
- Wow, nice.
Hello.
- You should get me on a talk show.
I'd kill.
- I'll get you on Springer.
Fat, little horny fucks, and the women that despise them.
SHAUNA:
What are you laughing at?
Maybe I'll get you on Montel with Don Swayze...
Joey Travolta and the other retarded star siblings.
- That's funny.
- Kimmel's girl just called.
They're calling back in an hour to do the pre-interview.
You're gonna have to do that, E.
It's gonna get my head screwed up.
I gotta keep my spontaneity.
Fuck spontaneity.
Well-dressed, well-prepared.
That's what makes you a star.
You wanna write that down for me in case I forget?
Yeah.
Try this one on, all right?
ERIC:
Yeah, that could be funny.
The script pages got all switched.
The director got confused.
- Everybody really laughed about it.
- Boring.
Then they fixed it.
Yeah, I guess you had to be there.
What else?
Tell him about that stoned-out craft service girl who blew me after lunch.
- Why don't you stop it, Drama?
- DRAMA:
I'm trying to help.
You're not helping.
You're embarrassing me.
I was on Arsenio.
It never aired.
'Cause he got cancelled, but I was good.
Uh, let's see.
Here's something.
I got one.
Vince went to the High School of Performing Arts where they shot Fame.
But he never saw the movie or the TV Show.
I always found that kind of funny.
Maybe not funny, but ironic at least.
I don't know.
Hold on a second.
You want to do this?
You're so funny.
This is your interview.
I've never done this before.
I don't know what to say.
You're doing a good job.
Yeah.
Vince actually...
He's not available right now.
I'll talk to him and see if we can come up with something.
I'll call you later, okay?
Thank you.
Man, you're really bombing, bro.
Maybe we should just cancel.
No.
Don't even cancel.
Just don't show.
That'll really fuck Kimmel.
You'd never cancel.
Why would I cancel when it's so much fun to watch him freak?
You're gonna freak.
Sara Foster is also on the show tonight.
Oh, shit.
You serious?
(LAUGHING)
- You're fucking dead!
- TURTLE:
Fuck you, baby!
(TURTLE WHOOPING)
Yo, Turtle!
(TURTLE WHOOPING)
I'm not walking.
Sara Foster?
That chick is hot.
You think she'll bring other hotties with her?
- Why would she?
- 'Cause hotties roll in packs, baby.
(HOWLING)
I never broke up with her, either.
We had that crazy night in the Hamptons.
I never called her again.
I'm not proud of that.
But that's not breaking up.
See?
My record's intact.
No asterisk there.
What are you gonna say to her?
What do you mean, what am I...
I'm not planning anything.
- What I say when I see her is what I'll say.
- What about Kristen, E?
Same thing.
Whatever I say when I see her is what I'll say.
Bullshit.
He's gonna cry like a little bitch.
Cry like a little bitch.
(EXCLAIMING)
(LAUGHING)
Why are you using Vince as a defense...
Run, Forrest, run!
ERIC:
You look great.
Thanks.
I'm probably in the best shape of my life.
- You look like shit.
- I do?
Yeah, who's been cutting your hair?
Turtle?
No, I just haven't...
- Still doing the Pilates?
- When I have time.
I'm really busy.
Yeah, me, too.
Real busy.
Got no time for anything.
No time for haircuts.
Got a lot of shit going on right now.
- Like what?
- Stuff.
- Really, like what?
- Like stuff.
Don't quiz me.
What did you do today?
You don't get my job, you never did.
I shopped and I played golf.
But it's not how it sounds.
Shopping and golf?
Vince is doing Jimmy Kimmel tonight.
I've got to keep his mind focused.
He's on with Sara Foster.
You know who that is?
They had a one-night stand and he never called her.
Can you believe that?
I can.
Vince has to break up with girls before it gets serious.
That way he can't get hurt.
Textbook narcissist.
He has major intimacy issues.
- You think that's what it is?
- I'm a Psych major, Eric.
Turtle tells me you're thinking of buying a house.
Not exactly.
Oh, of course.
Vince is gonna buy a house, and you're all gonna live in it.
Yeah.
Something like that.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
- Fuck.
- What?
What happened to you getting your own place?
- I am getting my own place.
- When?
When Vince dies?
When the time is right.
Jesus!
What?
Can't this wait?
It's in the second drawer.
Jesus!
- Vince says hello.
- Great.
Look, I gotta go.
I was hoping we weren't going to fight about this.
- I thought you like to fight.
- Only when it leads to make-up sex.
(CHUCKLING)
That's not gonna happen.
Wait.
Let's be clear about one thing, okay?
- This isn't make-up sex.
It's break-up sex.
- Whatever.
TURTLE:
This fucking place is a shithole.
DRAMA:
This can't be the place.
It looks like a dump.
RUFUS:
Luke Wilson's system was in the neighborhood of $190,000.
$190,000?
- Can't you do any better?
- No, I can't.
I didn't want to have to bring this up, all right?
- I work for a fairly prominent movie star.
- Yeah.
Who?
- Vincent Chase.
- RUFUS:
Really?
He's great.
Maybe you recognize me.
I'm his brother.
No.
TURTLE:
Anyway, off the record, my man is doing Jimmy Kimmel tonight.
- All right.
- What if we threw in a plug for your outfit?
Would that be cool?
Would that be worth something?
I'll tell you what.
You deliver on that promise, I give you half off.
But if he wears this hat, it's free.
So all he has to do is wear the hat?
- Check this out.
- She's sweet.
Yeah.
She's gonna be naked in a second.
(EXCLAIMING)
(ERIC SIGHING)
ERIC:
So, now what?
You wanna go to dinner tomorrow night?
Talk about all this?
Eric, you're really not getting this concept.
This was break-up sex, for real.
So, what, you just had sex with me as a goodbye?
Yeah.
It was great.
- I feel dirty.
- KRISTEN:
Take a shower.
DRAMA:
Tie or no tie?
TURTLE:
No tie.
- What do you know?
- ERIC:
Where are you guys going, church?
- Gotta look nice for the ladies.
- Vince, come on.
We're gonna be late.
- What ladies?
- Kimmel's green room.
We hear it's stocked like a trout pond.
So, how'd it go with Kristen?
- We said goodbye.
- After you plowed her?
- We had break-up sex, all right?
- "Break-up sex"?
Never heard of it.
Yeah.
You have sex, and then that's it.
You say goodbye.
That's the only kind of sex I have.
- Hey, homey.
- What's up?
ERIC:
You look like you just rolled out of bed.
Yeah, I did.
You're gonna wear that shirt?
No, it's wrinkled.
I'm gonna wear this one.
- You got style, bro.
- TURTLE:
Looks good!
We got a good show tonight.
All right, from the movie, The Big Bounce,
Sara Foster, here, tonight!
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
Heard a lot about this.
This movie everybody's talking about, the movie, Head On, the star of it, Vincent Chase, here, tonight!
- (AUDIENCE CHEERING) - (INDISTINCT TALKING)
- Where are the suits?
- Right here, baby.
Shauna, don't tell Kimmel I'm here.
'Cause he and I have some issues.
Yeah, mum's the word, Drama.
(WOMEN TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
Don't tell me you made notes.
Only one.
- Home Video Solutions.
- Yes.
You guys go to the green room.
I'm gonna take Vince to makeup.
- Where is it?
- That way.
Vince, extra concealer.
That's the key under house lights.
- Good luck, buddy.
- Go get them, baby!
I don't know about the afterlife, but this life is sweet.
- Shall we?
- We shall.
(TITTERING)
Wow.
This is bad.
What?
- I never called you.
- Please.
I never called you.
- Really?
- Really.
Yeah, well, I still feel bad.
I feel worse, trust me.
You look incredible.
You, too.
Come in.
Close the door.
You know me, Shauna.
I like to play the field.
Keep my options open.
When I settle down, it's gonna be forever.
Weren't you married once already?
Nine days.
It was annulled.
Next time.
Hmm.
- Ari's late.
- ERIC:
Good.
- I'm early.
- Good.
Hey, guys.
(SIGHING)
- You smoke?
- Cigarettes?
Yeah, I've been trying to quit recently.
- How hard are you trying?
- (CHUCKLING) Not that hard.
Good.
- I thought he quit?
- Cigarettes, not pussy.
Hmm.
(PEOPLE CHEERING)
Ready in five.
SARA:
We need 10.
EMILY:
I've tried everything.
I tried the patch.
It left a yellow stain on my arm.
- I know.
Me, too.
- Have you ever tried Nicorette?
I did, I tried it, but I couldn't follow the instructions.
I never thought chewing gum could be so complicated.
I even tried smoking only when drinking coffee.
Me, too, I started drinking 25 cups a day.
I went to a hypnotist, cost $500.
- How did that go?
- It went pretty good, until I saw a pair of shoes that I could've bought.
I started smoking again.
But this time I'm quitting for sure.
- For sure.
- Yeah.
Me, too.
Wanna share one more?
Let's share one more.
Definitely.
What kind of a guy do you go out with?
What do you look for in a man?
Honestly, just a regular, nice guy like yourself!
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
Tell him I don't represent talent.
I represent temperature, and he's not hot.
Sarah Silverman.
Hi.
- Ari Gold, hi.
- Nice to meet you.
- We've met before.
- No, I know...
They're booking hip people here.
Now, that's cool.
No, I'm not on the show tonight.
That's even hipper.
Cool people hanging out.
That's awesome.
That's cool.
Right.
I'm here representing my boy, Vinny Chase.
Are you going to the green room?
No, I'm not going in.
I got banned from that fucking place.
- Really?
- Yeah, it's ridiculous.
I had a little situation with Natalie Portman's father.
Stupid.
- It was a weird situation.
- I'll sneak you in.
Wanna go in with me?
Like we go in together?
You and me together?
Like, we're going in at the same time.
All right, but are we going to be leaving together is what I'm saying.
That's so scum-baggy.
I know you're married.
- I take Krav Maga with your wife.
- I know you do.
I'm not trying to fuck you, Sarah.
I'm trying to sign you.
Ooh.
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.
You're a funny girl.
I mean, you know... you do the ass jokes and stuff, I enjoy it.
What's the problem?
I'll be out in a second.
I'm sorry, I'll have to ask you not to hold hands.
The FCC says no overt displays of affection.
So...
Uh-oh.
Uh...
If you could just separate them.
Thank you.
We just had sex about five minutes ago.
(AUDIENCE ROARING)
That's another...
- VINCE:
Is that okay?
- No, you could be arrested for that.
- SARA:
So wrong!
- We're on the lam now.
(LAUGHS) It's wrong.
So, let's talk about the movie.
It comes out this weekend, right?
- I don't want to talk about it.
- You don't want to talk about it?
It's a mystery.
I wouldn't want to give it away.
I'm not here to plug anything.
I'm here to see you.
JIMMY:
Well, thank you.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
What about me?
- And you, of course.
- He's so full of it.
It's unbelievable.
So, we have a clip of the film.
And you need to set the clip up?
Forget about the clip.
All right, we'll forget about the clip.
VINCE:
Look, the movie's called Head On.
It's a cool movie, see it this weekend.
You're guaranteed to love it, or your money back.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
- From the studio.
Not from me.
- Yeah.
Right.
What would you like to talk about then?
I'll let you decide.
Well, why don't we talk about my brother?
He's really pissed.
He says you dissed him, you owe him a phone call.
- So you know what happened?
- I know what he told me.
I can't believe he's not talking about the movie.
- Get ready for some lies.
- He's going to run out of time.
How is he gonna work Home Video Solutions into this?
Would you shut up and listen?
What did he tell you?
He said that when he hit a rough patch, you kind of bailed on him... and you never called him again.
(AUDIENCE EXCLAIMING)
JIMMY:
He did not...
He said I bailed on him?
I was like a bounty hunter trying to get a hold of him.
I called his house.
I looked for his address.
He owes me a call.
I think he might be right.
He's backstage.
Who?
He is?
(AUDIENCE EXCLAIMING)
Is he really?
Johnny Drama's backstage?
Bring him out.
Because I'd love to clear this up.
Is he around?
Is he really backstage?
- Come on.
Go.
- Go!
TURTLE:
What's wrong with you?
Get out there!
(PEOPLE CHEERING)
Do I need makeup?
The great Johnny Drama!
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
- Maybe I did owe you a call, buddy.
- That's all right.
Johnny Drama, everybody!
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
(ALL LAUGHING)
VINCE:
Isn't that classic?
- How do I look?
I look pretty good?
- You do look thin.
- Thin?
I look lean.
- That's what I meant.
No body fat.
JIMMY:
You guys are living together now?
It's a bachelor pad?
What's the setup over there?
- Tell them about the home theater.
- Yeah.
So, we have this really great house.
And it's got everything.
- Except...
- Except... a home theater.
But we've been told that Rufus at Home Video Solutions is the best in the business.

You see that?
He recognized me.
$3 million for eight rounds!
It's unreal.
You gotta make a movie to make that much.
Are you crazy?
Did you see that guy's face?
No amount of money's gonna get me in the ring.
$50,000, I'd let Klitschko beat the fuck out of me.
I'll beat the fuck out of you for free.
What do you think?
I'm telling you, Klitschko don't hit that hard, man.
You kidding?
The guy's Russian.
He's got that Mongolian Genghis Khan warrior blood in him.
I'd do three shots of Stoli and let him blast away.
You fucking dick.
You'd be a dead man.
Yeah, but I'd be flush.
I tell you, I'd let that hit me for free...
- Fuck off, asshole.
- It was him.
- Relax.
- He didn't mean that.
- Hi, Vince.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Good.
I'm Johnny.
Let's go to the bar.
- Let's see.
What do you guys want?
- Beer, baby.
What did you think of the seats?
- Amazing.
- Two very slow white men.
I apologize.
But goddamn, there was some blood.
- You liked the blood?
- Loved it.
That was for you.
If you see Rob Schneider, tell him you bought those seats.
What do you want to drink?
Listen.
Three tequilas would be great, all right?
- Cheers!
- Good for what ails you.
Yes!
- Jimmy!
Jimmy Kimmel!
- How you doing?
You know Vincent Chase, right?
- Yeah, how are you?
- There you go.
- What's happening?
- Big fan.
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
We should get you on the show.
- Yeah.
I'd love to do it, anytime.
- I'd love to have you.
Like tomorrow, we'd love to have you if we could.
I don't know, you're putting me on the spot.
I know you got the movie.
- You got a movie coming out Friday.
- It can't hurt.
All right, fuck it.
See you tomorrow.
- There you go, he's in!
- All right.
I'll call you, then?
- Absolutely.
- Very good.
Thanks, Ari.
Pleased to meet you.
I can't.
I don't drink.
I'm sorry.
I do drink.
- Say hello to your brother for me, too.
- Johnny?
Tell him I said hi.
I haven't seen him in a long time.
- He's around here somewhere.
- See you, Jimmy.
There you go.
You're in.
So, I got this guy, Rufus.
He just installed this sweet little home system... in my place on Mulholland.
State-of-the art everything.
I could charge admission at this place.
- Really?
- I'm not kidding you.
Here's the kicker:
I mention Rufus' name in InStyle.
All he charges me for is installation.
- Fuck you!
- No.
Fuck you, seriously.
Rufus, that's how he does it.
He's a wild cat, Rufus.
I got his card here somewhere.
I'd love that.
You still doing that thing with Wes?
Yeah.
We're gonna start shooting in June.
Did you get anyone to play the part of the partner?
Yeah.
Unfortunately, my brother's gonna do it.
He's costly.
If he falls out, you think of me, right?
Always.
Always thinking of you, Johnny Drama.
- Thanks a lot, Luke.
I appreciate it.
- Call Rufus.
Vince, you gonna prepare anything for the show?
No.
That would take all the fun out of just winging it.
The guy's gonna ask you a lot of questions.
Yeah, it's Jimmy Kimmel.
Not 60 Minutes, bro.
All right, you'll see.
You should have some stories ready.
Hey, ladies.
You got any stories I can tell on Jimmy Kimmel?
You know what?
The night's still young.
The night is young.
- Taste this.
- I am not tasting that, it stinks.
- What the fuck is it?
- It's a new recipe.
Tofu spirulina scramble, it's delicious.
Taste it.
It smells like dog shit scramble.
Eat your Froot Loops and shut up.
- What the fuck smells?
- Open a window, Drama.
Jesus Christ!
You know what?
Kitchen's closed, fellas.
Enjoy cold cereal.
- So, you want to talk about Kimmel?
- Jimmy Kimmel?
- Vince is doing the show tonight.
- Fuck Jimmy Kimmel.
- You're angrier than usual this morning.
- Jimmy Kimmel's a prick.
Why?
He said to say hello to you.
He's a phony prick.
He and I were running buddies back in the day.
That was before I got kicked off of Melrose Place.
The money ran dry.
I lost my house.
I had to move into that motel on Wilcox.
After that, that was it.
He dropped me like a bad habit.
Never heard from the guy again.
I never heard that story.
Well, you know me.
I don't like to advertise.
- Cancel on the prick, Vince.
- He can't cancel.
- I can't cancel.
- What are you gonna talk about, though?
"What's up?" "Not much." "How you feeling?" "Pretty good."
Don't forget about the time you tanked on Regis and Kelly.
That was a morning show.
We pulled an all-nighter.
Plus, who could focus... with hot-ass Kelly Ripa up there interrogating you?
- So, what's really bothering you, E?
- What?
Are you really concerned about me, or is this maybe a Kristen issue?
- Yep.
- Don't tell me Kristen's back in the game.
Fuck off.
She's picking up her shit later today.
That's all.
I offered to help him box it up and send it off.
But he didn't want that.
Throw her shit in the garbage and change your number.
Yeah.
She comes down here, you're out of commission for two weeks.
I can't have that.
Broken up and still pussy-whipped.
That's just sad.
These guys are right.
You lose control around that girl.
You guys don't know dick.
You never had a relationship.
You never ended one.
The only person you've ever loved is yourself.
What's not to love?
Look, breaking up is painful.
That's why I never do it.
Why hurt someone when you can just let it drag on forever?
Come on.
You must've broken up with someone.
- No, Johnny.
Nobody.
- Bullshit!
What about Becky Serrano in junior high?
I remember, she was crying by the lockers.
I never broke up with Becky.
I liked her too much for that.
No, you just started banging Meredith Tierney at the same time.
Yeah.
I liked her, too.
I don't know how you get away with this shit.
Lucky guy.
Vince, I was talking to Luke Wilson last night.
He's got this phat home theater.
I think we should make a play for one.
- You couldn't call me?
- It happened last night.
There's a right way to do things and a wrong way to do things.
- And which one was this?
- Don't make a plan without consulting me.
You don't circumvent the system.
There are consequences.
Is he gonna get killed for going on Kimmel?
- You might get killed for being an asshole.
- Shauna.
If you want to do Kimmel, come to me.
I'm your publicist.
That's what I'm here for.
I gave him the idea for The Man Show.
He loves my ass.
- Come here with that neck.
- Cut that shit out.
Look, I'm serious.
You don't want to piss off Letterman or Leno.
- You don't want to piss off Shauna.
- I think she's looks kind of sexy, pissed.
I am.
But those guys are vindictive pricks.
Here, try this on.
- I'm sorry, okay?
Do you forgive me?
- Have you ever even seen the show?
- What?
Jimmy Kimmel?
- Yeah.
I don't know.
Maybe.
What's the difference?
He's not asking me to watch it.
He's asking to be on it.
I think he should go with Byblos.
If he decides later he doesn't like it, I'll take it.
Have to let the shoulders out a bit.
You should get a few suits to choose from, so you're not locked into one.
- He doesn't wear suits.
- He does now.
He gets them for free, you cheap fuck.
- That's a keeper.
- Nice.
Hello.
- You should get me on a talk show.
I'd kill.
- I'll get you on Springer.
Fat, little horny fucks, and the women that despise them.
What are you laughing at?
Maybe I'll get you on Montel with Don Swayze...
Joey Travolta and the other retarded star siblings.
- That's funny.
- Kimmel's girl just called.
- They're calling back in an hour.
- You're gonna have to do that, E.
It's gonna get my head screwed up.
I gotta keep my spontaneity.
Fuck spontaneity.
Well-dressed, well-prepared.
That's what makes you a star.
You wanna write that down for me in case I forget?
Yeah.
Try this one on, all right?
Yeah, that could be funny.
The script pages got all switched.
The director got confused.
- Everybody really laughed about it.
- Boring.
Then they fixed it.
Yeah, I guess you had to be there.
What else?
Tell him about that stoned-out craft service girl who blew me after lunch.
- Why don't you stop it, Drama?
- I'm trying to help.
You're embarrassing me.
I was on Arsenio.
It never aired.
'Cause he got cancelled, but I was good.
Let's see.
Here's something.
I got one.
Vince went to the High School of Performing Arts where they shot Fame.
But he never saw the movie or the TV Show.
I always found that kind of funny.
Maybe not funny, but ironic at least.
I don't know.
Hold on a second.
You want to do this?
This is your interview.
I've never done this before.
I don't know what to say.
You're doing a good job.
Yeah.
Vince actually...
He's not available right now.
I'll talk to him and see if we can come up with something.
I'll call you later, okay?
Thank you.
Man, you're really bombing, bro.
Maybe we should just cancel.
No.
Don't even cancel.
Just don't show.
That'll really fuck Kimmel.
You'd never cancel.
Why would I cancel when it's so much fun to watch him freak?
You're gonna freak.
Sara Foster is also on the show tonight.
Shit.
You serious?
- You're fucking dead!
- Fuck you, baby!
Yo, Turtle!
I'm not walking.
Sara Foster?
That chick is hot.
You think she'll bring other hotties with her?
- Why would she?
- 'Cause hotties roll in packs, baby.
I never broke up with her, either.
We had that crazy night in the Hamptons.
I never called her again.
I'm not proud of that.
But that's not breaking up.
See?
My record's intact.
No asterisk there.
What are you gonna say to her?
What do you mean, what am I...
I'm not planning anything.
- What I say when I see her is what I'll say.
- What about Kristen, E?
Same thing.
Whatever I say when I see her is what I'll say.
Bullshit.
He's gonna cry like a little bitch.
Cry like a little bitch.
Why are you using Vince as a defense...
Run, Forrest, run!
You look great.
Thanks.
I'm probably in the best shape of my life.
- You look like shit.
- I do?
Yeah, who's been cutting your hair?
Turtle?
No, I just haven't...
- Still doing the Pilates?
- When I have time.
I'm really busy.
Yeah, me, too.
Real busy.
Got no time for anything.
No time for haircuts.
Got a lot of shit going on right now.
- Like what?
- Stuff.
- Really, like what?
- Like stuff.
Don't quiz me.
What did you do today?
You don't get my job, you never did.
I shopped and I played golf.
But it's not how it sounds.
Shopping and golf?
Vince is doing Jimmy Kimmel tonight.
I've got to keep his mind focused.
He's on with Sara Foster.
You know who that is?
They had a one-night stand and he never called her.
Can you believe that?
I can.
Vince has to break up with girls before it gets serious.
That way he can't get hurt.
Textbook narcissist.
He has major intimacy issues.
- You think that's what it is?
- I'm a Psych major, Eric.
Turtle tells me you're thinking of buying a house.
Not exactly.
Of course.
Vince is gonna buy a house, and you're all gonna live in it.
Yeah.
Something like that.
- Fuck.
- What?
What happened to you getting your own place?
- I am getting my own place.
- When?
When Vince dies?
When the time is right.
Jesus!
What?
Can't this wait?
It's in the second drawer.
Jesus!
- Vince says hello.
- Great.
Look, I gotta go.
I was hoping we weren't going to fight about this.
- I thought you like to fight.
- Only when it leads to make-up sex.
That's not gonna happen.
Wait.
Let's be clear about one thing, okay?
- This isn't make-up sex.
It's break-up sex.
- Whatever.
This fucking place is a shithole.
This can't be the place.
It looks like a dump.
Luke Wilson's system was in the neighborhood of $190,000.
$190,000?
- Can't you do any better?
- No, I can't.
I didn't want to have to bring this up, all right?
- I work for a fairly prominent movie star.
- Yeah.
Who?
- Vincent Chase.
- Really?
He's great.
Maybe you recognize me.
I'm his brother.
No.
Anyway, off the record, my man is doing Jimmy Kimmel tonight.
- All right.
- What if we threw in a plug for your outfit?
Would that be cool?
Would that be worth something?
I'll tell you what.
You deliver on that promise, I give you half off.
But if he wears this hat... it's free.
So all he has to do is wear the hat?
- Check this out.
- She's sweet.
Yeah.
She's gonna be naked in a second.
So, now what?
You wanna go to dinner tomorrow night?
Talk about all this?
Eric, you're really not getting this concept.
This was break-up sex, for real.
So, what, you just had sex with me as a goodbye?
Yeah.
It was great.
- I feel dirty.
- Take a shower.
- Tie or no tie?
- No tie.
- What do you know?
- Where are you guys going, church?
- Gotta look nice for the ladies.
- Vince, come on.
We're gonna be late.
- What ladies?
- Kimmel's green room.
We hear it's stocked like a trout pond.
So, how'd it go with Kristen?
- We said goodbye.
- After you plowed her?
- We had break-up sex, all right?
- "Break-up sex"?
Never heard of it.
Yeah.
You have sex, and then that's it.
You say goodbye.
That's the only kind of sex I have.
- Hey, homey.
- What's up?
- You look like you just rolled out of bed.
- Yeah, I did.
You're gonna wear that shirt?
No, it's wrinkled.
I'm gonna wear this one.
- You got style, bro.
- Looks good!
We got a good show tonight.
All right, from the movie, The Big Bounce...
Sara Foster, here, tonight!
Heard a lot about this.
This movie everybody's talking about... the movie, Head On, the star of it, Vincent Chase, here, tonight!
- Where are the suits?
- Right here, baby.
Shauna, don't tell Kimmel I'm here.
'Cause he and I have some issues.
Yeah, mum's the word, Drama.
Don't tell me you made notes.
Only one.
- Home Video Solutions.
- Yes.
You guys go to the green room.
I'm gonna take Vince to makeup.
- Where is it?
- That way.
Vince, extra concealer.
That's the key under house lights.
- Good luck, buddy.
- Go get them, baby!
I don't know about the afterlife, but this life is sweet.
- Shall we?
- We shall.
This is bad.
What?
- I never called you.
- Please.
I never called you.
- Really?
- Really.
Yeah, well, I still feel bad.
I feel worse, trust me.
You look incredible.
You, too.
Come in.
Close the door.
You know me, Shauna.
I like to play the field.
Keep my options open.
When I settle down, it's gonna be forever.
Weren't you married once already?
Nine days.
It was annulled.
Next time.
- Ari's late.
- Good.
- I'm early.
- Good.
Hey, guys.
- You smoke?
- Cigarettes?
Yeah, I've been trying to quit recently.
- How hard are you trying?
- Not that hard.
Good.
- I thought he quit?
- Cigarettes, not pussy.
Ready in five.
We need 10.
I've tried everything.
I tried the patch.
It left a yellow stain on my arm.
- I know.
Me, too.
- Have you ever tried Nicorette?
I did, I tried it, but I couldn't follow the instructions.
I never thought chewing gum could be so complicated.
I even tried smoking only when drinking coffee.
Me, too, I started drinking 25 cups a day.
I went to a hypnotist, cost $500.
- How did that go?
- It went pretty good... until I saw a pair of shoes that I could've bought.
I started smoking again.
But this time I'm quitting for sure.
- For sure.
- Yeah.
Me, too.
Wanna share one more?
Let's share one more.
Definitely.
What kind of a guy do you go out with?
What do you look for in a man?
Honestly, just a regular, nice guy... like yourself!
Tell him I don't represent talent.
I represent temperature, and he's not hot.
Sarah Silverman.
Hi.
- Ari Gold, hi.
- Nice to meet you.
- We've met before.
- No, I know...
They're booking hip people here.
Now, that's cool.
No, I'm not on the show tonight.
That's even hipper.
Cool people hanging out.
That's awesome.
That's cool.
Right.
I'm here representing my boy, Vinny Chase.
Are you going to the green room?
No, I'm not going in.
I got banned from that fucking place.
- Really?
- Yeah, it's ridiculous.
I had a little situation with Natalie Portman's father.
Stupid.
- It was a weird situation.
- I'll sneak you in.
Wanna go in with me?
Like we go in together?
You and me together?
Like, we're going in at the same time.
All right, but are we going to be leaving together is what I'm saying.
That's so scum-baggy.
I know you're married.
- I take Krav Maga with your wife.
- I know you do.
I'm not trying to fuck you, Sarah.
I'm trying to sign you.
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.
You're a funny girl.
I mean, you know... you do the ass jokes and stuff, I enjoy it.
What's the problem?
I'll be out in a second.
I'm sorry, I'll have to ask you not to hold hands.
The FCC says no overt displays of affection.
So...
If you could just separate them.
Thank you.
We just had sex about five minutes ago.
That's another...
- Is that okay?
- No, you could be arrested for that.
- So wrong!
- We're on the lam now.
It's wrong.
So, let's talk about the movie.
It comes out this weekend, right?
- I don't want to talk about it.
- You don't want to talk about it?
It's a mystery.
I wouldn't want to give it away.
I'm not here to plug anything.
I'm here to see you.
Well, thank you.
What about me?
- And you, of course.
- He's so full of it.
It's unbelievable.
So, we have a clip of the film.
And you need to set the clip up?
Forget about the clip.
All right, we'll forget about the clip.
Look, the movie's called Head On.
It's a cool movie, see it this weekend.
You're guaranteed to love it, or your money back.
- From the studio.
Not from me.
- Yeah.
Right.
What would you like to talk about then?
I'll let you decide.
Well, why don't we talk about my brother?
He's really pissed.
He says you dissed him, you owe him a phone call.
- So you know what happened?
- I know what he told me.
I can't believe he's not talking about the movie.
- Get ready for some lies.
- He's going to run out of time.
How is he gonna work Home Video Solutions into this?
Would you shut up and listen?
What did he tell you?
He said that when he hit a rough patch, you kind of bailed on him... and you never called him again.
He did not...
He said I bailed on him?
I was like a bounty hunter trying to get a hold of him.
I called his house.
I looked for his address.
He owes me a call.
I think he might be right.
He's backstage.
Who?
He is?
Is he really?
Johnny Drama's backstage?
Bring him out.
Because I'd love to clear this up.
Is he around?
Is he really backstage?
- Come on.
Go.
- Go!
What's wrong with you?
Get out there!
Do I need makeup?
The great Johnny Drama!
- Maybe I did owe you a call, buddy.
- That's all right.
Johnny Drama, everybody!
Isn't that classic?
- How do I look?
I look pretty good?
- You do look thin.
- Thin?
I look lean.
- That's what I meant.
No body fat.
You guys are living together now?
It's a bachelor pad?
What's the setup over there?
- Tell them about the home theater.
- Yeah.
So, we have this really great house.
And it's got everything.
- Except...
- Except... a home theater.
But we've been told that Rufus at Home Video Solutions is the best in the business.
Here you go!
- To Drama.
- To Drama.
Great night.
Great fucking night.

XVID 512x384 23.976fps 233.1 MB
Lights Out, it's Johnny Drama!
What's up, man?
You see that?
He recognized me.
$3 million for eight rounds!
It's unreal.
You gotta make a movie to make that much.
Are you crazy?
Did you see that guy's face?
No amount of money's gonna get me in the ring.
$50,000, I'd let Klitschko beat the fuck out of me.
I'll beat the fuck out of you for free.
What do you think?
I'm telling you, Klitschko don't hit that hard, man.
You kidding?
The guy's Russian.
He's got that Mongolian Genghis Khan warrior blood in him.
I'd do three shots of Stoli and let him blast away.
You fucking dick.
You'd be a dead man.
Yeah, but I'd be flush.
I tell you, I'd let that hit me for free...
- Fuck off, asshole.
- It was him.
- Relax.
- He didn't mean that.
- Hi, Vince.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Good.
I'm Johnny.
Let's go to the bar.
- Let's see.
What do you guys want?
- Beer, baby.
What did you think of the seats?
- Amazing.
- Two very slow white men.
I apologize.
But goddamn, there was some blood.
- You liked the blood?
- Loved it.
That was for you.
If you see Rob Schneider, tell him you bought those seats.
What do you want to drink?
Listen.
Three tequilas would be great, all right?
- Cheers!
- Good for what ails you.
Yes!
- Jimmy!
Jimmy Kimmel!
- How you doing?
You know Vincent Chase, right?
- Yeah, how are you?
- There you go.
- What's happening?
- Big fan.
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
We should get you on the show.
- Yeah.
I'd love to do it, anytime.
- I'd love to have you.
Like tomorrow, we'd love to have you if we could.
I don't know, you're putting me on the spot.
I know you got the movie.
- You got a movie coming out Friday.
- It can't hurt.
All right, fuck it.
See you tomorrow.
- There you go, he's in!
- All right.
I'll call you, then?
- Absolutely.
- Very good.
Thanks, Ari.
Pleased to meet you.
I can't.
I don't drink.
I'm sorry.
I do drink.
- Say hello to your brother for me, too.
- Johnny?
Tell him I said hi.
I haven't seen him in a long time.
- He's around here somewhere.
- See you, Jimmy.
There you go.
You're in.
So, I got this guy, Rufus.
He just installed this sweet little home system... in my place on Mulholland.
State-of-the art everything.
I could charge admission at this place.
- Really?
- I'm not kidding you.
Here's the kicker:
I mention Rufus' name in InStyle.
All he charges me for is installation.
- Fuck you!
- No.
Fuck you, seriously.
Rufus, that's how he does it.
He's a wild cat, Rufus.
I got his card here somewhere.
I'd love that.
You still doing that thing with Wes?
Yeah.
We're gonna start shooting in June.
Did you get anyone to play the part of the partner?
Yeah.
Unfortunately, my brother's gonna do it.
He's costly.
If he falls out, you think of me, right?
Always.
Always thinking of you, Johnny Drama.
- Thanks a lot, Luke.
I appreciate it.
- Call Rufus.
Vince, you gonna prepare anything for the show?
No.
That would take all the fun out of just winging it.
The guy's gonna ask you a lot of questions.
Yeah, it's Jimmy Kimmel.
Not 60 Minutes, bro.
All right, you'll see.
You should have some stories ready.
Hey, ladies.
You got any stories I can tell on Jimmy Kimmel?
You know what?
The night's still young.
The night is young.
- Taste this.
- I am not tasting that, it stinks.
- What the fuck is it?
- It's a new recipe.
Tofu spirulina scramble, it's delicious.
Taste it.
It smells like dog shit scramble.
Eat your Froot Loops and shut up.
- What the fuck smells?
- Open a window, Drama.
Jesus Christ!
You know what?
Kitchen's closed, fellas.
Enjoy cold cereal.
- So, you want to talk about Kimmel?
- Jimmy Kimmel?
- Vince is doing the show tonight.
- Fuck Jimmy Kimmel.
- You're angrier than usual this morning.
- Jimmy Kimmel's a prick.
Why?
He said to say hello to you.
He's a phony prick.
He and I were running buddies back in the day.
That was before I got kicked off of Melrose Place.
The money ran dry.
I lost my house.
I had to move into that motel on Wilcox.
After that, that was it.
He dropped me like a bad habit.
Never heard from the guy again.
I never heard that story.
Well, you know me.
I don't like to advertise.
- Cancel on the prick, Vince.
- He can't cancel.
- I can't cancel.
- What are you gonna talk about, though?
"What's up?" "Not much." "How you feeling?" "Pretty good."
Don't forget about the time you tanked on Regis and Kelly.
That was a morning show.
We pulled an all-nighter.
Plus, who could focus... with hot-ass Kelly Ripa up there interrogating you?
- So, what's really bothering you, E?
- What?
Are you really concerned about me, or is this maybe a Kristen issue?
- Yep.
- Don't tell me Kristen's back in the game.
Fuck off.
She's picking up her shit later today.
That's all.
I offered to help him box it up and send it off.
But he didn't want that.
Throw her shit in the garbage and change your number.
Yeah.
She comes down here, you're out of commission for two weeks.
I can't have that.
Broken up and still pussy-whipped.
That's just sad.
These guys are right.
You lose control around that girl.
You guys don't know dick.
You never had a relationship.
You never ended one.
The only person you've ever loved is yourself.
What's not to love?
Look, breaking up is painful.
That's why I never do it.
Why hurt someone when you can just let it drag on forever?
Come on.
You must've broken up with someone.
- No, Johnny.
Nobody.
- Bullshit!
What about Becky Serrano in junior high?
I remember, she was crying by the lockers.
I never broke up with Becky.
I liked her too much for that.
No, you just started banging Meredith Tierney at the same time.
Yeah.
I liked her, too.
I don't know how you get away with this shit.
Lucky guy.
Vince, I was talking to Luke Wilson last night.
He's got this phat home theater.
I think we should make a play for one.
- You couldn't call me?
- It happened last night.
There's a right way to do things and a wrong way to do things.
- And which one was this?
- Don't make a plan without consulting me.
You don't circumvent the system.
There are consequences.
Is he gonna get killed for going on Kimmel?
- You might get killed for being an asshole.
- Shauna.
If you want to do Kimmel, come to me.
I'm your publicist.
That's what I'm here for.
I gave him the idea for The Man Show.
He loves my ass.
- Come here with that neck.
- Cut that shit out.
Look, I'm serious.
You don't want to piss off Letterman or Leno.
- You don't want to piss off Shauna.
- I think she's looks kind of sexy, pissed.
I am.
But those guys are vindictive pricks.
Here, try this on.
- I'm sorry, okay?
Do you forgive me?
- Have you ever even seen the show?
- What?
Jimmy Kimmel?
- Yeah.
I don't know.
Maybe.
What's the difference?
He's not asking me to watch it.
He's asking to be on it.
I think he should go with Byblos.
If he decides later he doesn't like it, I'll take it.
Have to let the shoulders out a bit.
You should get a few suits to choose from, so you're not locked into one.
- He doesn't wear suits.
- He does now.
He gets them for free, you cheap fuck.
- That's a keeper.
- Nice.
Hello.
- You should get me on a talk show.
I'd kill.
- I'll get you on Springer.
Fat, little horny fucks, and the women that despise them.
What are you laughing at?
Maybe I'll get you on Montel with Don Swayze...
Joey Travolta and the other retarded star siblings.
- That's funny.
- Kimmel's girl just called.
- They're calling back in an hour.
- You're gonna have to do that, E.
It's gonna get my head screwed up.
I gotta keep my spontaneity.
Fuck spontaneity.
Well-dressed, well-prepared.
That's what makes you a star.
You wanna write that down for me in case I forget?
Yeah.
Try this one on, all right?
Yeah, that could be funny.
The script pages got all switched.
The director got confused.
- Everybody really laughed about it.
- Boring.
Then they fixed it.
Yeah, I guess you had to be there.
What else?
Tell him about that stoned-out craft service girl who blew me after lunch.
- Why don't you stop it, Drama?
- I'm trying to help.
You're embarrassing me.
I was on Arsenio.
It never aired.
'Cause he got cancelled, but I was good.
Let's see.
Here's something.
I got one.
Vince went to the High School of Performing Arts where they shot Fame.
But he never saw the movie or the TV Show.
I always found that kind of funny.
Maybe not funny, but ironic at least.
I don't know.
Hold on a second.
You want to do this?
This is your interview.
I've never done this before.
I don't know what to say.
You're doing a good job.
Yeah.
Vince actually...
He's not available right now.
I'll talk to him and see if we can come up with something.
I'll call you later, okay?
Thank you.
Man, you're really bombing, bro.
Maybe we should just cancel.
No.
Don't even cancel.
Just don't show.
That'll really fuck Kimmel.
You'd never cancel.
Why would I cancel when it's so much fun to watch him freak?
You're gonna freak.
Sara Foster is also on the show tonight.
Shit.
You serious?
- You're fucking dead!
- Fuck you, baby!
Yo, Turtle!
I'm not walking.
Sara Foster?
That chick is hot.
You think she'll bring other hotties with her?
- Why would she?
- 'Cause hotties roll in packs, baby.
I never broke up with her, either.
We had that crazy night in the Hamptons.
I never called her again.
I'm not proud of that.
But that's not breaking up.
See?
My record's intact.
No asterisk there.
What are you gonna say to her?
What do you mean, what am I...
I'm not planning anything.
- What I say when I see her is what I'll say.
- What about Kristen, E?
Same thing.
Whatever I say when I see her is what I'll say.
Bullshit.
He's gonna cry like a little bitch.
Cry like a little bitch.
Why are you using Vince as a defense...
Run, Forrest, run!
You look great.
Thanks.
I'm probably in the best shape of my life.
- You look like shit.
- I do?
Yeah, who's been cutting your hair?
Turtle?
No, I just haven't...
- Still doing the Pilates?
- When I have time.
I'm really busy.
Yeah, me, too.
Real busy.
Got no time for anything.
No time for haircuts.
Got a lot of shit going on right now.
- Like what?
- Stuff.
- Really, like what?
- Like stuff.
Don't quiz me.
What did you do today?
You don't get my job, you never did.
I shopped and I played golf.
But it's not how it sounds.
Shopping and golf?
Vince is doing Jimmy Kimmel tonight.
I've got to keep his mind focused.
He's on with Sara Foster.
You know who that is?
They had a one-night stand and he never called her.
Can you believe that?
I can.
Vince has to break up with girls before it gets serious.
That way he can't get hurt.
Textbook narcissist.
He has major intimacy issues.
- You think that's what it is?
- I'm a Psych major, Eric.
Turtle tells me you're thinking of buying a house.
Not exactly.
Of course.
Vince is gonna buy a house, and you're all gonna live in it.
Yeah.
Something like that.
- Fuck.
- What?
What happened to you getting your own place?
- I am getting my own place.
- When?
When Vince dies?
When the time is right.
Jesus!
What?
Can't this wait?
It's in the second drawer.
Jesus!
- Vince says hello.
- Great.
Look, I gotta go.
I was hoping we weren't going to fight about this.
- I thought you like to fight.
- Only when it leads to make-up sex.
That's not gonna happen.
Wait.
Let's be clear about one thing, okay?
- This isn't make-up sex.
It's break-up sex.
- Whatever.
This fucking place is a shithole.
This can't be the place.
It looks like a dump.
Luke Wilson's system was in the neighborhood of $190,000.
$190,000?
- Can't you do any better?
- No, I can't.
I didn't want to have to bring this up, all right?
- I work for a fairly prominent movie star.
- Yeah.
Who?
- Vincent Chase.
- Really?
He's great.
Maybe you recognize me.
I'm his brother.
No.
Anyway, off the record, my man is doing Jimmy Kimmel tonight.
- All right.
- What if we threw in a plug for your outfit?
Would that be cool?
Would that be worth something?
I'll tell you what.
You deliver on that promise, I give you half off.
But if he wears this hat... it's free.
So all he has to do is wear the hat?
- Check this out.
- She's sweet.
Yeah.
She's gonna be naked in a second.
So, now what?
You wanna go to dinner tomorrow night?
Talk about all this?
Eric, you're really not getting this concept.
This was break-up sex, for real.
So, what, you just had sex with me as a goodbye?
Yeah.
It was great.
- I feel dirty.
- Take a shower.
- Tie or no tie?
- No tie.
- What do you know?
- Where are you guys going, church?
- Gotta look nice for the ladies.
- Vince, come on.
We're gonna be late.
- What ladies?
- Kimmel's green room.
We hear it's stocked like a trout pond.
So, how'd it go with Kristen?
- We said goodbye.
- After you plowed her?
- We had break-up sex, all right?
- "Break-up sex"?
Never heard of it.
Yeah.
You have sex, and then that's it.
You say goodbye.
That's the only kind of sex I have.
- Hey, homey.
- What's up?
- You look like you just rolled out of bed.
- Yeah, I did.
You're gonna wear that shirt?
No, it's wrinkled.
I'm gonna wear this one.
- You got style, bro.
- Looks good!
We got a good show tonight.
All right, from the movie, The Big Bounce...
Sara Foster, here, tonight!
Heard a lot about this.
This movie everybody's talking about... the movie, Head On, the star of it, Vincent Chase, here, tonight!
- Where are the suits?
- Right here, baby.
Shauna, don't tell Kimmel I'm here.
'Cause he and I have some issues.
Yeah, mum's the word, Drama.
Don't tell me you made notes.
Only one.
- Home Video Solutions.
- Yes.
You guys go to the green room.
I'm gonna take Vince to makeup.
- Where is it?
- That way.
Vince, extra concealer.
That's the key under house lights.
- Good luck, buddy.
- Go get them, baby!
I don't know about the afterlife, but this life is sweet.
- Shall we?
- We shall.
This is bad.
What?
- I never called you.
- Please.
I never called you.
- Really?
- Really.
Yeah, well, I still feel bad.
I feel worse, trust me.
You look incredible.
You, too.
Come in.
Close the door.
You know me, Shauna.
I like to play the field.
Keep my options open.
When I settle down, it's gonna be forever.
Weren't you married once already?
Nine days.
It was annulled.
Next time.
- Ari's late.
- Good.
- I'm early.
- Good.
Hey, guys.
- You smoke?
- Cigarettes?
Yeah, I've been trying to quit recently.
- How hard are you trying?
- Not that hard.
Good.
- I thought he quit?
- Cigarettes, not pussy.
Ready in five.
We need 10.
I've tried everything.
I tried the patch.
It left a yellow stain on my arm.
- I know.
Me, too.
- Have you ever tried Nicorette?
I did, I tried it, but I couldn't follow the instructions.
I never thought chewing gum could be so complicated.
I even tried smoking only when drinking coffee.
Me, too, I started drinking 25 cups a day.
I went to a hypnotist, cost $500.
- How did that go?
- It went pretty good... until I saw a pair of shoes that I could've bought.
I started smoking again.
But this time I'm quitting for sure.
- For sure.
- Yeah.
Me, too.
Wanna share one more?
Let's share one more.
Definitely.
What kind of a guy do you go out with?
What do you look for in a man?
Honestly, just a regular, nice guy... like yourself!
Tell him I don't represent talent.
I represent temperature, and he's not hot.
Sarah Silverman.
Hi.
- Ari Gold, hi.
- Nice to meet you.
- We've met before.
- No, I know...
They're booking hip people here.
Now, that's cool.
No, I'm not on the show tonight.
That's even hipper.
Cool people hanging out.
That's awesome.
That's cool.
Right.
I'm here representing my boy, Vinny Chase.
Are you going to the green room?
No, I'm not going in.
I got banned from that fucking place.
- Really?
- Yeah, it's ridiculous.
I had a little situation with Natalie Portman's father.
Stupid.
- It was a weird situation.
- I'll sneak you in.
Wanna go in with me?
Like we go in together?
You and me together?
Like, we're going in at the same time.
All right, but are we going to be leaving together is what I'm saying.
That's so scum-baggy.
I know you're married.
- I take Krav Maga with your wife.
- I know you do.
I'm not trying to fuck you, Sarah.
I'm trying to sign you.
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.
You're a funny girl.
I mean, you know... you do the ass jokes and stuff, I enjoy it.
What's the problem?
I'll be out in a second.
I'm sorry, I'll have to ask you not to hold hands.
The FCC says no overt displays of affection.
So...
If you could just separate them.
Thank you.
We just had sex about five minutes ago.
That's another...
- Is that okay?
- No, you could be arrested for that.
- So wrong!
- We're on the lam now.
It's wrong.
So, let's talk about the movie.
It comes out this weekend, right?
- I don't want to talk about it.
- You don't want to talk about it?
It's a mystery.
I wouldn't want to give it away.
I'm not here to plug anything.
I'm here to see you.
Well, thank you.
What about me?
- And you, of course.
- He's so full of it.
It's unbelievable.
So, we have a clip of the film.
And you need to set the clip up?
Forget about the clip.
All right, we'll forget about the clip.
Look, the movie's called Head On.
It's a cool movie, see it this weekend.
You're guaranteed to love it, or your money back.
- From the studio.
Not from me.
- Yeah.
Right.
What would you like to talk about then?
I'll let you decide.
Well, why don't we talk about my brother?
He's really pissed.
He says you dissed him, you owe him a phone call.
- So you know what happened?
- I know what he told me.
I can't believe he's not talking about the movie.
- Get ready for some lies.
- He's going to run out of time.
How is he gonna work Home Video Solutions into this?
Would you shut up and listen?
What did he tell you?
He said that when he hit a rough patch, you kind of bailed on him... and you never called him again.
He did not...
He said I bailed on him?
I was like a bounty hunter trying to get a hold of him.
I called his house.
I looked for his address.
He owes me a call.
I think he might be right.
He's backstage.
Who?
He is?
Is he really?
Johnny Drama's backstage?
Bring him out.
Because I'd love to clear this up.
Is he around?
Is he really backstage?
- Come on.
Go.
- Go!
What's wrong with you?
Get out there!
Do I need makeup?
The great Johnny Drama!
- Maybe I did owe you a call, buddy.
- That's all right.
Johnny Drama, everybody!
Isn't that classic?
- How do I look?
I look pretty good?
- You do look thin.
- Thin?
I look lean.
- That's what I meant.
No body fat.
You guys are living together now?
It's a bachelor pad?
What's the setup over there?
- Tell them about the home theater.
- Yeah.
So, we have this really great house.
And it's got everything.
- Except...
- Except... a home theater.
But we've been told that Rufus at Home Video Solutions is the best in the business.
Here you go!
- To Drama.
- To Drama.
Great night.
Great fucking night.
On a lake in east Africa, one million flamingoes jostle for space.
It's a massive gathering, the biggest flock of flamingoes on the planet, and every day, it's getting bigger.
They're attracted by the safety of the lake, but as more flamingoes arrive this sanctuary is in danger of becoming a battleground.
Predators are drawn here, too, attracted by the prospect of flamingo flesh.
Unusual predators, who normally never prey on flamingo.
So, the stage is set for a violent confrontation.
The lives of both the hunted, and the hunters are on the line.
In a few moments, one of these flamingoes might be eaten by an animal that doesn't really hunt birds.
But why ?
This is the exact moment when the flamingo's life hangs in the balance.
Will the flamingo cheat death ?
Or is it doomed to die here ?
To find out, we need to go back in time, to look at the flamingo's life and discover the critical events witch might have led to this.
Three months earlier, the flamingo is over 300 miles further south, on lake Natron, in Tanzania.
Most of the massive flock is scattered right across East Africa but this group has come here to face one of the biggest challenges of their life.
In one of the hottest places in the whole world, flamingo parents are struggling to bring up their chicks.
On muddy islands, in the middle of the lake, they are invisible from the continent.
Safe in their nursery, hidden from hunters.
But the lake waters that surrounds them is treacherous.
It's horribly corrosive, like ammonia.
The flamingo's leather legs can stand it, but it will burn any other animal's skin to the bone.
So, predators don't raid out, and the chicks are safe.
But this security comes with a scorching price.
In mid-day , the surface temperature of the lake can reach 60 degrees centigrade hot enough to fry an egg, rather than hatch one.
So the parents build nests on mounds of wet mud, a foot high, and then shade their chicks to keep them cool.
But the adults can't baby-sit all the time.
They have their own needs, too.
On a daily basis, parents have to leave the chicks, to fly off and search for food.
At only 10 days old, the chicks are left in the crèche, to fend for themselves.
Like predators, the weather is also an enemy.
As it gets hotter, the shallow lake begins to dry out.
In places it evaporates to a harmless, soda crust, witch provides a land bridge for invaders to walk across.
This hellhole of a nursery is far from safe now.
The most vulnerable are the youngest chicks, who can't keep up with the crowd and don't stand a chance against the hyena.
Wherever you encounter death in Africa, there will be a mortuary bird stalking the muddy sea.
Maribu storks normally just scavenge corpses, but they'll kill, too.
Their huge scissor-like bills make short work of small chicks.
The most likely survivors are chicks witch hatch at the same time.
They show the herd instinct of sticking together in the crèche, or running together out of harm's way.
Now the flamingo parts in a race against time.
In the dry outs, the lake's disappearing fast, it's not safe anymore.
The chicks need to be well-fed so their flight feathers can grow quicly.
Because it's time to escape to another lake, a safer home.
A few week later, lake Natron is virtually empty.
Only some late hatches are still here.
The caustic water of the lake, witch was once a protection, now imprisons them.
As the lake dries out, soda crystals have collected around the chick's ankles and set like concrete.
This dead weight will soon stop the chick from walking, let alone flying.
A few chicks, out of sync with the rest, will die.
But most survive
Most stay safe by sticking with the massive crowd.
The drought is beginning to affect life back at lake Bogoria, too.
The flamingo numbers are starting to build up but the flock is not yet at massive proportions.
There is still one month to go before the flamingo-baboon confrontation.
There may be water in the lake, but inland, the country's bone-dry.
And the baboons are hungry.
This part of Kenya is a virtual desert in the dry season.
So, this troop is resorting to eating grass roots.
Even for these dusty, meager mouthfuls they have to travel further each day.
Their wonderings may take them into unusual territory but survival is all about grabbing any opportunity you can.
Several miles further south, at another lake, a fish eagle is still doing what fish eagles do best.
Hunting fish.
It's well equipped for the job.
With needle-sharp talons, and amazing aerobatics skills.
Fish eagles normally live on fresh water lakes, not places where you find flamingoes.
But, at this time of year, with so many flamingoes passing by, a fish eagle might just be tempted to leave its usual home, and follow the crowd.
That much potential prey on the move, is just too big on opportunity to miss.
Flamingoes usually fly at night, very high in the sky.
This way they can travel in massive flocks, and yet avoid too much unwelcome attention.
Flamingoes are survivors, they live long lives often up to 40 years, and they are constantly on the move, covering thousands of miles backwards and forwards across Africa, searching for food and safety.
In East Africa, they're homing in on the rift valley's soda lakes
In the drought, many of these shallow lakes have dried out.
But there's one lake that still has everything they'll need.
From every direction, flamingoes are homing in on lake Bogoria.
The deepest soda lake for hundreds of miles and for now, the best place to be.
Little do they realize, that in 2 weeks time one of these flamingoes will meet a baboon, and come face to face with death.
But witch one will it be ?
Unaware of their fate, all they want to do now, is make the most of lake Bogoria can offer.
And that's something really quite special.
On the lake shore, water wells up over rift valley's volcanic rock in scolding hot springs and geysers.
These flow into the lake, and once there the water becomes more concentrated, and corrosive.
This creates a place uninhabitable to almost everything except flamingoes.
There are no fish in the lake, and no crocodiles, so the flamingoes are safe swimming out in the water.
Bu on shore there's danger.
The baboons have arrived.
Birds aren't their usual prey especially such big ones.
But these are desperate times, rampant hunger will soon drive the baboons to change their ways.
Maybe the fish eagle will try its luck, too.
Flamingoes are big birds to bring down, so it won't be easy.
but the eagle must catch one, because there's absolutely nothing to eat here.
These flamingoes are walking a fine line between life and death.
Any move made now, could start a chain of events with a terrible end, in just one week's time.
But witch birds are the winners, and witch are the losers ?
Can anyone flamingo do anything to improve its chances at the moment of impact ?
It's the new arrivals, exhausted from the long journey, that are most at risk.
And if the recent parents are still being pestered for food by their chicks, they'll be especially vulnerable.
But these particular parent birds are the lucky ones.
Because incredibly, flamingoes only manage to bring up a chick every 7 years.
With only one week until impact, what happens from now on is crucial.
To build their strength, flamingoes need to eat.
And surprisingly enough, the lurry green waters are choke full of bacteria rich in essential nutrients.
These birds feed in an extraordinary way, gulping water, then pumping it out through bristles inside their bills, witch sift out the bacteria at an incredible rate of 20 bill fulls a second.
And to avoid dipping their heads in the caustic water flamingoes feed with their bills upside down, the enlarged upper bill act as a float, to keep bird's head near the surface in the super rich scum.
Because the food is microscopic, the flamingoes have to suck up at least 4 gallons of water a day, to get enough to eat.
This takes hours and hours of feeding.
They also need to avoid burning too many calories.
Feeding while swimming in deep water, swinging your head like this, uses a lot of energy.
Feeding while standing is a lot less effort,
And closer to shore, where the wind has blown the scum, is a much higher concentration of food.
But standing in the shallows with your head down, is a very risky position to be in.
Now, hunger has driven the fish eagle to change the habits of a life-time, and hunt birds instead of fish.
Flamingoes are awkward birds with no real means of self defense.
Their natural response to danger is to get away , fast.
So the minute they're threatened, they run for take-off.
For the fish eagle, it's crucial not to waste energy in a long chase.
It must be a quick kill.
That looked easy, but the hard part is working out what to do with the corpse.
Compared with catching fish, witch weigh ounces, dragging off a 4 pound flamingo or trying to balance on soft, squishy mud, is impossible.
So, hungry or not, the eagle has to abandon its feast, and think again.
Once the eagle's gone, it doesn't take long for the other flamingoes to drift back to the shallows.
Back into danger.
Why do they take such a risk ?
It's not just richer food that draws them to the shore.
There's something else here that these birds can't live without.
They're surrounded by water, but in this lake, they can't drink a drop.
The water's so salty, it's effectively poison.
To quench their thirst the flamingoes must find fresh water and the only place they can get that, is from the hot springs and streams on the shore.
But salty lake water also makes their feathers sticky, so, at the hot springs, they wash carefully.
If they didn't, they wouldn't be able to fly, losing a crucial means of escape
But with so few springs, and so many flamingoes, they have to queue to get a bath.
Flamingoes use the same instinctive rules used by pedestrians on busy city pavements.
Staying in orderly lines, and following the bird in front, is the most efficient way to move in a crowd.
This sort of ritualized behavior doesn't just make life easy, it could make the difference between life and death.
With the flamingoes back in range, the fish eagle tries again.
So, will it make the same mistake again, and strike well out of its depth ?
Was the fish eagle luckier this time ?
Or did they consciously plan a whole new method of attack ?
The flamingo caught was a straggler, it was injured, it couldn't keep up.
Any predator could see that it was doomed
It's a tactic that a baboon could do well to follow.
Is this the crucial rule for survival when attacked ?
Don't get separated from the crowd.
Is sticking with the massive flock always the safest place to be ?
With just one day to go, the huge numbers of flamingoes at lake Bogoria is close to breaking point.
Something's got to give.
It's hot, very hot.
And there's not enough food to go around.
In these conditions, the birds get stressed and many get sick.
And in massive flocks like this diseases spread like wildfire.
That's the opportunity the baboons have been waiting for.
One baboon is prepared to risk, waiting through painfully corrosive water to snatch its chance.
But this is rotten, and possibly diseased meat.
It would be much better for them to eat live flamingo flesh, if they ever get the chance.
And that chance is coming in less than 2 hours time.
Now, though, it's far too hot to move.
It's time to sleep.
Time drags, as the afternoon passes.
The heat becomes even more intense.
The flamingoes are now desperate for a drink.
The middle of the lake is overcrowded.
There no room to move, and not enough water to go around.
So, some decide to look for water elsewhere.
But the only place to go, the only place with a permanent fresh water stream is 5 miles away, at the south end.
And little do these flamingoes know, that it's also inhabited by a troop of hungry baboons.
They've arrived at an oasis of cool water and shady fig trees.
It's perfect for thirsty flamingoes, but it's also a trap.
The flamingoes don't realize it, but by choosing to drink here and separating from the main flock they're putting themselves in real danger.
The baboons watch carefully looking for a chance.
This could be what they're looking for.
This bird has a badly infected foot an injury common in massive flocks.
Tightly packed, the birds are effectively standing in they own sewer.
So, any cuts in the flamingo's skin, quickly become infected.
When the baboon makes a move the healthy flamingoes turn away quickly.
But the injured bird has less energy and doesn't react as fast
It's an obvious target.
Despite the risks the flamingoes keep coming, because they have no choice.
They must drink.
They must drink here.
These flamingoes are bound to be edgy after what's just happened.
But they're also twitchy because they're used with the safety of being in a bigger group.
The baboons now know what they want.
Flamingo.
And if there's the slightest chance of getting one, they will.
Will this flamingo live ?
Is survival just a lottery ?
Or are they specific tactical reasons why some birds live and others die ?
At the moment of attack this flamingo escaped.
The baboon is left empty handed and hungry.
But why was this bird a winner ?
What are the precise reasons why this flamingo got away ?
Most important of all, it learnt from an early age to react early to danger.
To move fast and stick with the flock whether in a crèche, running away from the hyenas, or with the adults, escaping from the fish eagle.
But how did the flamingo, drinking with its back to the shore spot the baboon in time ?
It escaped by following the same instinct used by all animals that live in a group.
Keep an eye on your immediate neighbors at all times and at the first hint of hurried movement copy them
If they turn right, you turn right if they flap their wings, you flap, too.
That way, it only needs one bird to recognize danger and take evasive action, and then like a life preserving Mexican wave the escape response sweeps through the flock in a fraction of a second.
A wise flamingo learns that the safest place to live is in the thick of it.
Living on the edge is suicide.
Stick to the center of a million strong crowd and your odds of being eaten are a million to one.
Being individual, step out of the flock and life can be over very quickly.
The only downside is that a massive flock needs massive supplies.
In this huge flock food and water are still in short supply and the future looks bleak for everyone.
Unless something changes soon.
With the rains, the streams and lakes will refill
There'll be water to drink, and plenty more wet places for the flamingoes to run.
Now, all these animals can leave this overcrowded lake, and spread out across Africa again.
Predators picked off a few flamingoes but it's nature, in the form of weather, that holds the ultimate power over life.
If the rains had failed, the death toll might have been massive.
It's only because the rains did come, that life can continue on this massive scale.
Now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything and the one son who had no choice but to keep them all together.
It's Arrested Development.
Michael was using the Bluth Company crane to retrieve the family-owned frozen banana stand after it had been dumped in the bay, a holiday tradition among the local youth.
Soon, he returned home so that he and his son...
George Michael?
...could share their holiday tradition of rebuilding it.
- Another one of Dad's suits?
- Hey, I'm the President now.
Filling Dad's shoes.
Literally.
Except his shoes don't fit.
But, I did finally got into Dad's pants.
Although I had to have the crotch taken out a little bit.
You know, Gob, maybe it's the suits, but I think you may be beginning to alienate some of the employees down at work.
What?
Oh!
That's great...
The President has to worry about alienating the employees now.
In fact, Gob had started to alienate some of his colleagues.
Worse that can happen is I can spill some on my $3,000 suit.
Come on!
Oh, yeah, yeah.
The guy in the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in 3 months.
Come on!
Why don't I just take a whiz through this $5,000 suit?
!
Come on!
They like me just fine.
You'll see that tonight when they toast me at the Christmas party.
Just like they used to with Dad.
They used to roast Dad 'cause they thought that he had a sense of humor about himself, but he didn't, and neither do you.
Hey, nobody laughed louder than me at any joke about Dad.
You're the one who was all Mister
I take myself too seriously all the time.
Michael did tend to take the Christmas parties somewhat seriously.
Uh, oh, no, no, thank you.
Merry Christmas.
You can go ahead and put that right in the charity barrel.
Thank you very much.
Thanks a lot.
Sorry, pal.
We just can't have them resent us.
I know some of the numbers haven't all added up, and there is some speculation that George has been into the kitty.
Into the kitty!
He is awesome.
Meow.
Fire Tom, and get your jackass brother out of here.
This year, I'm not officially President, and it'll be nice to actually have some fun with my son at a Christmas party.
Thank God I don't have to go.
Oh, I'm so glad to hear you say that.
I want to meet someone there.
What?
So, I'm not invited to the Bluth Company Christmas party?
Oh, honey, of course you can go if you want to.
Thanks, Mom.
No, you're not going to that.
You see, if I show up with you, it'll just make me seem like I'm a mother.
I've never thought of you that way.
That's sweet.
Well, I won't be going.
I will be head to toe in blue makeup until 8:01 in case the Blue Man Group needs their understudy, so...
No, no you have to go, so when men find out we're in an open relationship, they'll see you're no threat.
People hear the name Tobias, they think-- big black guy.
Well, obviously, I'm not a big guy.
I'm not a Carl Weathers, par example.
I forgot about Carl.
Is he still single?
Hey, George Michael, I need you to help me fix up the banana stand.
I know.
I can't.
I'm supposed to go to Ann's parents' Christmas party.
We're making yams.
Tonight?
Tonight is the office party.
Well, did you want me to go to that?
You're always telling me not to have fun at those things.
Yes.
We might even snatch a gift from the charity barrel.
Oh... kay.
Well, um...
Well, I think Ann's parents are having their party on Bethlehem time, which is pretty early, so maybe I can make an appearance.
Make an appearance.
Uh, uh, no, no.
It's-It's okay, uh, you be with Yam.
It's fine.
It's good.
- It's Ann.
- It's good.
Have fun.
Boy's pulling away from you.
Are we having yams?
Yeah, I don't know what's going on with him.
You know, he's-he's on Bethlehem time.
He's spending every moment of the day with this girl.
- It's, like, I'm his father.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't get involved.
Believe me, when I thought your first wife was driving us apart, I did not make a stink.
You complained all the time, and she was my only wife.
And she died.
Yeah, well.
See, things have a way of working themselves out.
Nonetheless.
It's family first at the holidays.
Oh, God, it's Mom again.
Put it on speaker phone.
I want to hear her beautiful voice.
Michael!
There's a hole in the window.
There's been a break-in!
Get over here!
- I'm leaving now.
- She sounds tense.
That means she's not getting any from my brother Oscar.
Lovely.
That's nice.
I heard about the banana stand, and now there's been a break-in.
But I have a surprise for whoever it is if he comes back.
First I blow him, then I poke him.
Guy has no idea what he's in for.
You know, Mom, all the glass seems to be on the outside.
Plus, here's your little statue, so, I guess what this says to me is,
I doubt anyone was trying to break in, Mom.
If anything, someone was trying to break out.
Where is Oscar?
Oh, he's on his walkabout, or pilgrimage.
Every year, Oscar attempts the 420 mile walk from Newport Beach to Berkeley, California.
In the 12 years he's attempted this, he's never made it past U.C. Irvine.
He calls it a quest to recharge his chi.
I call it an excuse for him to score his pot and wag his pickle at coeds.
You sound mad, Mom.
Mad enough to throw one of these little lady heads at him.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Well, it just...
You know...
Maybe you're a little bit lonely, and you're acting out for attention.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
I want you to move in with me.
What?
!
No.
No.
No.
No, no, no, no.
Didn't you adopt a child for this very reason, so that you would never be alone?
Michael, a mother doesn't have a child to give herself company.
Annyong was to teach Buster a lesson.
And where is that little lesson?
I sent him to the Milford Academy to teach him a lesson.
I can't remember about what.
And Buster left this morning to finish his Army training.
In fact, Lucille had refused to drive him to the Army base, so Buster was taking his very first bus ride.
I can't change a hundred.
Oh, damn it.
Stop it.
Oh.
And that's when Buster saw something interesting.
That could be good for Army.
While just 20 yards away,
Michael went to work repairing the banana stand.
What are you doing here?
My mom signed me out of school early, so then she wouldn't have to pick me up later, so then she wouldn't be late for the Christmas party.
That's about the worst thing I've ever heard.
I had to drive because she had a little bit of a buzz on.
No, that's it.
You're doing this alone?
Yeah.
Oh, thanks.
I guess George Michael's getting a little too old to hang out with his Dad.
Yeah, and I'm getting too old for my mom to be with me.
You know what?
Maybe we should go to this party together?
- Really?
- Yeah.
You're my little niece.
I think we should be spending a little bit more time together.
Yeah, and if it makes my mom jealous.
And George Michael can run back to his precious Ann.
Great.
Good deal.
Michael and Maeby stopped by the office to see if Gob needed help for the party that was now hours away.
...king 63 hundred dollar suit.
Come on!
- Hi there.
- What's she doing here?
Merry Christmas to you, too, Uncle Gob.
Everything all right?
I just don't want people's kids getting their sticky little fingers all over these 26,000 dollar pants.
Oh, yeah?
You think they're gonna go right for the pants, do you?
Okay, okay, okay.
So, should-should... should, uh, should...
Should-should...
Sh-sh-sh...
Should-Should... should, uh, should...
We'll do it your way.
I'm just here to have fun.
Not too much, all right?
I already gave my big sexual harassment speech today.
Please refrain from discussing or engaging in any sort of interoffice ( bleep )ing or ( bleep )ing of finger ( bleep ) or ( bleep )sting or ( bleep )ing or even ( bleep ).
Even though so many so many people in this office are begging for it.
And if anybody does anything with my sister Lindsay,
I'll take off my pants,
I'll shave my ( bleep ).
And I'll personally ( bleep )...
Let's get this going.
What are you talking about, now?
You're not gonna let these people go home and change their clothes?
I don't think we need people trying to compete with what I'm wearing.
Everybody, uh, come out of your offices, please.
Party is now started.
Here we go.
Let's go.
Everybody dance now!
Everybody dance now!
Oh, I think we're off to a great start.
And so, Michael started to become relaxed.
And a short time later, his mother arrived anything but.
Someone broke in again!
The liquor is gone.
All of it.
Gone!
In fact, Gob had stolen it earlier that day to cut down on the cost of the party.
Hey, need a hand with that?
No, Al.
I want to spill booze all over my fu...
I'm all alone there, Michael.
No.
Buster's only stationed about five miles away.
In fact, Buster never went to the Army.
He'd gotten hooked playing the skill crane and missed his first day.
Somewhat ashamed and with nowhere to go he returned home.
Buster!
Thank God you're back.
There's no shame in being a coward.
A coward?
I'm not a coward.
Would a coward have this?
What the hell is that?
These are my awards, Mother.
From Army.
The seal is for marksmanship, and the gorilla is for sand racing.
You're doing well?
I was just dropping these off.
Now if you'll excuse me, they're putting me in something called Hero Squad.
You have no idea what it's like to be abandoned by your son.
Do you see my son?
He chose his girlfriend over me.
- How the worm has turned.
- Oh, Mother.
Look who feels the sting of an ungrateful child.
Mother, you have to receive something to be ungrateful.
The point is, I'm not getting worked up over it tonight.
I'm not gonna let anything bother me.
Good.
I'll get a drink, and then go home, and wait for you to come stay with me.
Thank God they've got my brands here.
This was an unacceptable solution.
Hey, uh, Tobias, it's Michael.
I hope you get this.
I need you to go over to my mother's tonight.
Unfortunately, Tobias missed the call from the Bluth Company, and it went through to Michael's home voice mail.
The Blue Men!
You have 101 unheard messages.
First message.
Michael, it's your mother.
Michael, pick up.
Happy Thanksgiving!
Michael, it's Mother.
Michael, pick up.
Hey, uh, Tobias.
It's Michael.
I hope you get this.
- Bluth Company !
- I need you to go over to my mother's tonight.
And Lindsay showed up at the Christmas Party.
Unfortunately, she didn't realize that the employees had been threatened against flirting.
Oh, hello, Ted.
Oh, if you're worried about my husband, it's fine.
He's no bigger than a Cub Scout.
You could take him, and you could certainly take me.
This has been pleasant and professional.
Good luck in the coming business year.
Hey.
Are you guys sticking stuff on Gob's suit?
Shh.
Go away.
You're going to ruin it.
Aunt Lindsay.
How's the party?
It is the worst Christmas party I've ever been to in my life.
Now, watch this.
Yep, like my last ten years.
And my daughter won't give me the time of day.
How was your party?
Oh, it was... it was good.
They're kind of... religious, Ann's family, so it was... yeah, it was just kind of...
The word George Michael was searching for was "creepy."
Jesus, bleibet meine Freude
Meines Herzens Trost
Let me give you a hand with that, little fella.
Jesus wehret
Allem Leide...
Hey, I was talking to the sound guy, and he said he's got this karaoke thing.
Yeah, let's do it.
Put the first song on in the book.
- Okay.
- Okay?
Thanks very much.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, I thought you were at your party.
No, no, they said I could leave for the second hour of silent prayer.
But Ann and I do have to go back, so I should...
I should go soon.
Uncle Michael.
Okay.
I'll be right there.
Sorry.
I've got to go do this.
I'll be right back.
And Michael sang a duet with his niece.
Gonna hold her tight
Gonna grab some afternoon delight
- My daughter doesn't need me.
- Neither does my dad.
Had George Michael and Lindsay stayed, they might have discovered what Michael and Maeby did-- that "Afternoon Delight" was more adult-themed than its innocent melody would have you believe.
And the thought of rubbing you is getting so exciting
- Skyrockets in flight...
- Hang on, Maeby.
Afternoon delight...
Listen, I'm going to go get some punch because it is toast time.
Okay?
No, no, no, it'll look worse.
Go that way.
So...
Let's toast me.
Who's first?
Tom, why don't you come up here and talk about me for a few minutes.
Uh, I want to thank the Bluth family for hiring me back.
It's been a tough couple of years.
My brother did that.
Talk about me.
Oh, okay.
Uh, you certainly do love those suits.
Seven grand-- you better believe I love them.
I mean, look...
look what you're wearing.
You look like crap.
I mean, at least this is...
What...?
Who did this?
- You do this, Tom?
- No.
You're a real smart ass, you know that, Tom.
Look, I don't know him very well, but
Gob seems like he'd be a really smart boss.
Please, don't laugh.
Look, he... he's a great magician.
( bleep ) you, Tom.
Please, don't.
No, you know what, you're fired.
No, you're all fired.
Each and every one of you.
Merry Christmas.
I didn't know the lyrics.
Where's everybody going?
- We don't work here anymore.
- What?
Is your sister still around?
The Christmas party had been a disaster.
I did the right thing, Michael.
If I don't fire them, how do I teach a lesson to the others?
There are no others.
You fired everyone.
Oh, that's... that's-that's great.
The guy who's dirty dancing with his niece is going to tell the guy in the 36... hundred dollar suit how to run the business.
Come on.
I know.
Maybe we're better off with me being business-like and you being the good-time, useless party guy.
- It got us this far.
- Mm-hmm.
And must say that I miss the laughter.
Oh, God, how they used to laugh with me.
At you.
We got to figure out a way to hire everybody back.
- A meeting.
- A party.
No, we just had a party.
Yeah, but I didn't get to have any fun.
And so, Michael went to work on another Christmas party, this time with the help of his niece.
I really appreciate you doing this.
I didn't want to ask George Michael.
Did you see that he showed up at the party for 5 minutes last night and left without even saying good-bye.
Hey, my mom doesn't even want to be in the same room with me.
Michael.
I was almost attacked last night, in my own home.
I walk in and there's a colored man in my kitchen.
"Colored"?
What color was he exactly?
Blue.
Hello, Lucille.
Yeah, I sent him to your house to keep you safe.
Well, be did a terrible job, didn't he?
I need someone else.
Someone better.
What about this one?
She's got thick arms.
Mom, you just need to calm down a little bit.
You're so tense.
How am I supposed to calm down?
She sounds tense.
That means she's not getting any from my brother, Oscar.
I mean, maybe I should move in with you.
And Michael realized he needed to retrieve his Uncle Oscar.
How would you like to go on a road trip?
No, I want to stay with her.
Let's go.
And so the two of them prepared to drive up the coast.
Okay, you're in charge of the radio, and we're not stopping until we find Uncle Oscar.
There he is.
My mom is very stressed out, and, uh, she needs something that I can't give her.
Um... maybe a little "Afternoon Delight"?
Oscar thought that Michael was referring to a particular brand of cannabis named "Afternoon Deelite," a strain famous for slowing behavior.
Well, sure.
The question is, which way do I try to get it in her?
I don't need any details.
Maybe I'll put it in her brownie.
Hey!
What happened to you?
What?
Oh, oh, my ears.
The doctor said I can't go to sleep for five hours, or I might die, or something.
Oh, I got blown!
So I can't sleep!
Hey, have you seen Maeby?
You're not going to believe this.
Apparently, my dad and Maeby took a drive up the coast.
You're kidding me.
Uh-oh.
I should not have picked at that.
That's blood.
This is ridiculous.
So she's got a new parent.
Yeah, now my dad's got a new kid.
I'm going to lie down for a little bit.
But just, I-I... it's...
I can't fall...
Hey, how would you like to come to the party with me today?
And Oscar was giving Lucille a little "Afternoon Deelite."
- Mmm, these are really delicious.
- I'll get some more.
Where did she go?
And soon, the second Bluth Company Christmas party in as many days began.
You are not fired, sir.
I really appreciate that.
You got it.
Here you go.
Merry Christmas.
Where the hell is my brother?
Sure-sure, the guy in the $600 banana suit.
Come on!
Hey.
What the hell are you doing?
Don't be mad at me 'cause you didn't think about getting up at 6:00 a.m.
and going out to Tarzana to get the ol' banana suit out of storage.
But it's worth it, because it's time for me to make people laugh again.
With me.
What's funnier than a guy in an-
- Oh!
Hey, wait.
Hey!
Hey!
You're pulling my leg off!
Later, Gob was inside the banana stand and it was getting pretty hot in there, so he decided to lose a layer.
Hey, look, there's your mom and George Michael.
I guess they did come to support us after all.
Look at that.
They're all over each other.
With their little secrets.
- Well, what can you do, right?
- Yeah.
How would you feel about singing a little karaoke?
Unfortunately, Lindsay wasn't there to see all of Michael and Maeby's song, and was about to have a similar revelation.
And I think I might try nibbling a little afternoon delight...
That's my wife and nephew!
We have an open relationship!
Lucille arrived, craving a frozen banana.
And the effects of Lindsay and George Michael's "Afternoon Delight"
was overshadowed by the effects of Oscar and Lucille's "Afternoon Deelite."
Tobias.
Tobias, watch out.
Tobias couldn't hear and didn't manage to get out of the way in time.
What the hell was that?
And Gob couldn't move freely.
Lucille tried to come to a stop, but the car hit Gob's banana peel.
I can't get out of here.
I'm stuck.
Mom, are you crazy?
You could've killed somebody.
Hey, Mikey, relax.
It's just a giant banana.
And that's when Buster saw an opportunity to be a hero.
- Gob?
- Mom, I'm stuck!
I got you, brother!
For the second time since he became president,
Gob heard the sweet sound of laughter.
They're laughing with me, Michael.
They're laughing with me.
Unfortunately, Buster's newfound skills did not involve lowering gently.
Hey, it's Tobias.
Who wants to take me to the hospital?
And so, father and son reunited, rebuilding the banana stand for a second time.
Hey, can I give you a hand?
Hey.
Yeah.
That would be great.
Okay.
So, um, I'm sorry about Listen, I-I, well...
I, uh, I've been a little out of line lately, and you're entitled to be with your girlfriend.
I guess I got a little bit jealous.
Yeah, well, me, too.
Gonna grab some afternoon...
Does not seem like it would be that dirty.
It is catchy.
That's the thing.
On the next Arrested Development.
The Blue Man Group finally calls for Tobias with a life-changing opportunity.
Unfortunately, he can't hear it and his life stays the same.
Now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything... and the one son who had no choice... but to keep them all together.
It's Arrested Development.
[Man Narrating] Michael was using the Bluth Company crane... to retrieve the family-owned frozen banana stand after it had been dumped in the bay... a holiday tradition among the local youth.

You can go ahead and put that right in the charity barrel.
Thanks a lot.

We just can't have them resent us.
I know some of the numbers haven't all added up, and there is some speculation... that George has been into the kitty [Laughter] - "Into the kitty"!
That's awesome.
[Whispering] Fire Tom and get your jackass brother out of here.
This year I'm not officially president, and it'll be nice to actually have some fun... with my son at a Christmas party.
- Thank God I don't have to go.
- So glad to hear you say that.
I wanna meet someone there.

It's good.
Have fun.
The boy's pulling away from you.
Are we having yams?
Yeah, I don't know what's goin' on with him.
You know, he's on Bethlehem time.
He's spending every moment of the day with this girl.
- It's, like, I'm his father.
He should be spending most-
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't get involved.
Believe me.
When I thought your first wife was driving us apart...
I did not make a stink.
You complained all the time, and she was my only wife.
And she died.
Well, see, things have a way of working themselves out.

But I have a surprise for whoever it is if he comes back.
First I blow him;
then I poke him.
Guy has no idea what he's in for.
You know, Mom, all the glass seems to be on the outside.
Plus, here's your little statue... so I guess what this says to me is, I doubt anyone was trying to break in, Mom.
If anything, someone was trying to break out.
Where is Oscar?
Well, he's on his walkabout or pilgrimage.
[Narrator] Every year, Oscar attempts the 420-mile walk... from Newport Beach to Berkeley, California.
In the 12 years he's attempted this... he's never made it past U.C. Irvine.
He calls it a quest to recharge his chi.
I call it an excuse for him... to score his pot and wag his pickle at coeds.
You sound mad, Mom, mad enough to throw one of these little lady heads at him.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Well, maybe you're a little bit lonely... and you're acting out for attention.
That's ridiculous.
I want you to move in with me.
What?
No.
No.
No.
No, no, no, no.
Didn't you adopt a child for this very reason?
So that you would never be alone?
Michael, a mother doesn't have a child to give herself company.
- Annyong was to teach Buster a lesson.
- And where is that little lesson?
I sent him to the Milford Academy to teach him a lesson.
I can't remember about what.
And Buster left this morning to finish his army training.
[Narrator] In fact, Lucille had refused to drive him to the army base... so Buster was taking his very first bus ride.
- I can't change a hundred.
- Oh.
Oh, God.
Oh.
[Narrator] And that's when Buster saw something interesting.
That could be good for army.
[Laughs]
[Imitates Whirring Crane]
[Narrator] Whilejust 20 yards away, Michael went to work repairing the banana stand.
[Michael] What are you doin' here?
My mom signed me out of school early, so she wouldn't have to pick me up later... so she wouldn't be late for the Christmas party.
- That's about the worst thing I've ever heard.
- I had to drive...
- because she had a little bit of a buzz on.
- No.
That's it.
- You doing this alone?
- Yeah.
Well, thanks.
I guess George Michael's gettin' a little too old to hang out with his dad.
- Yeah, and I'm getting too old for my mom to be with me.
- You know what?
- Maybe we should go to this party together.
- Really?
Yeah.
You're my little niece.
I think we should be spending more time together.
- And if it makes my mom jealous-
- And George Michael can run back to his precious Ann.
Great.
Good deal.
[Bells Jingling]
[Narrator] Michael and Maeby stopped by the office to see if Gob needed help... for the party that was now hours away.
...king $6,300 suit!
- Come on!
- Hi there.
- What's she doin' here?
- Merry Christmas to you too, Uncle Gob.
- Everything all right?
- I just don't want people's kids getting their sticky fingers... all over these $2,600 pants.
Oh, yeah?
You think they're gonna go right for the pants?
Okay, okay, okay.
So, should- should- should- should, should, should-
- Shh.
- Should- should- should-
We'll do it your way.
I'm just here to have fun.
Not too much fun, all right?
I already gave my big sexual harassment speech today.
And please refrain from discussing or engaging... in any sort of interoffice- [Bleeps]
Or-[Bleeps] Or finger-[Bleeps]
Or- [Bleeps] fisting or- [Bleeps]
Or even- [Bleeps] even though so many people in this office are begging for it.
And if anybody does anything with my sister Lindsay...
I'll take off my pants, I'll shave-[Bleeps]
And I'll personally- [Long Bleep]
- Let's get this going.
- What are you talking about?
Now?
You're not gonna let these people go home and change their clothes?
I don't think we need people tryin' to compete with what I'm wearing.
Everybody, come out of your offices, please.
The party has now started.
- Here we go.
Let's go.
- [Stereo:
Disco]
Everybody dance now.
[Over Microphone] Everybody dance now.
I think we're off to a great start.
[Narrator] And so, Michael started to become relaxed, and a short time later... his mother arrived anything but.
Someone broke in again.
The liquor is gone.
All of it- gone.
[Narrator] In fact, Gob had stolen it earlier that day... to cut down on the cost of the party.
- Hey, need a hand with that?
- No, Al.
I wanna spill booze all over my f-
- I'm all alone there, Michael.
- You know, Buster's only stationed about five miles away.
[Narrator] In fact, Buster never went to the army.
- He'd gotten hooked playing the skill crane and missed his first day.
- [Trilling]
- Somewhat ashamed and with nowhere to go, he returned home.
- Hey, Buster.
- [Door Closes] - [Gasps] Buster!
Thank God you're back!
There's no shame in being a coward.
A coward?
I'm not a coward.
- Would a coward have this?
- What the hell is that?
These are my awards, Mother, from army.
The seal is for marksmanship... and the gorilla is for sand racing.
- You're doing well?
- I was just dropping these off.
Now, if you'll excuse me, they're putting me in something called Hero Squad.
You have no idea what it's like to be abandoned by your son.
Do you see my son?
He chose his girlfriend over me.
How the worm has turned.
Look who feels the sting of an ungrateful child.
Mother, you have to receive something to be ungrateful.
I'm not gettin' worked up over it tonight.
I'm not gonna let anything bother me.
Good.
I'll get a drink and then go home and wait for you to come stay with me.
Thank God they've got my brands here.
[Narrator] This was an unacceptable solution.
Hey, Tobias, it's Michael.
I hope you get this.
I need you to go over to my mother's tonight.
[Narrator] Unfortunately, Tobias missed the call... and it went through to Michael's home voice mail.
- The Blue Men!
- [Phone Beeps]
[Voice On Phone] You have 101 unheard messages.
First message.
- Michael, it's your mother- - [Beep]
- Michael, pick up.
- [Beep]
- Happy Thanksgiving
- Michael, it's Mother-
- Michael, pick up- - [Beep]
- [Michael On Phone] Hey, Tobias, it's Michael.
- [Groans] Bluth Company.
[Narrator] And Lindsay showed up at the Christmas party.
Unfortunately, she didn't realize the employees had been threatened against flirting.
Oh, hello, Ted.
Oh, if you're worried about my husband, it's fine.
He's no bigger than a Cub Scout.
You could take him, and you could certainly take me.
This has been pleasant and professional.
Good luck in the coming business year.
- [Chuckles] Hey, you guys are sticking stuff on Gob's suit?
- Shh.
Go away.
You're gonna ruin it.
Aunt Lindsay, how's the party?
It is the worst Christmas party I've ever been to in my life.
Yeah.
Watch this.
[Sucks Teeth]
Yep.
Like my last 10 years.
And my daughter won't give me the time of day.
- How was your party?
- Oh, it was good.
They're kind of religious, Ann's family, so it was-
Yeah, it was just kind of-
[Narrator] The word George Michael was searching for was "creepy."
- [Piano] - [Singing Hymn In German]
[Ann Singing Loudly, Out OfTune]
Let me give you a hand with that, little fella.
[Continuing In German]
Hey, I was talkin' to the sound guy, and he said he's got this karaoke thing.
- Yeah.
Let's do it.
Put the first song on in the book.
- Okay.
Okay?
Thanks very much.
Hey.
I thought you were at your party.
No, no.
They said I could leave for the second hour of silent prayer.
But Ann and I do have to go back, so I should
- I should go soon.
- [Amplified] Uncle Michael-
- Okay.
I'll be right there.
Sorry.
I gotta go do this.
I'll be right back.
- [Narrator] And Michael sang a duet with his niece.
[Out OfTune]
- [Maeby Singing Out Of Tune]
- My daughter doesn't need me.
Neither does my dad.
[Narrator] Had George Michael and Lindsay stayed, they might have discovered... what Michael and Maeby did- that "Afternoon Delight"was more adult-themed... than its innocent melody would have you believe.
- [Michael Trails Off]
- Hang on, Maeby.
[Embarrassed Chuckle] Listen.
I'm gonna go get some more punch, because it is toast time.
Okay?
No, no, no.
It'll look worse.
Go that way.
So, let's toast me.
Who's first?
Huh.
Tom, why don't you come up here and talk about me for a few minutes?
Uh, I wanna thank the Bluth family for hiring me back.
It's been a tough couple years.
- My brother did that.
Talk about me.
- Oh, okay.
Uh, you certainly do love those suits.
At seven grand, you'd better believe I love 'em.
I mean, look at what you're wearing.
You look like crap.
I mean, at least this is-
[Grunts] Who did this?
- [All Snickering]
- You do this, Tom?
- No.
- You're a real smart-ass.
You know that, Tom?
Look, I don't know him very well... but Gob seems like he'd be a really smart boss.
- [Laughter]
- Please don't laugh.
- Look, he's a great magician.
- [Hysterical Laughter]
- [Man] That's even better!
- [Bleeps] you, Tom.
- Please don't.
- You know what?
You're fired.
No.
You're all fired, each and every one of you.
Merry Christmas.
I didn't know the lyrics.
Where's everybody goin'?
- We don't work here anymore.
- What?
Is your sister still around?
[Narrator] The Christmas party had been a disaster.
I did the right thing, Michael.
If I don't fire them, how do I teach a lesson to the others?
- There are no others.
You fired everyone.
- Oh, that- that's great.
The guy who's dirty dancing with his niece is gonna tell the guy in the $3,600 suit... how to run the business.
- Come on.
- I know.
Maybe we're better off... with me being businesslike and you being the good-time, useless party guy.
- It got us this far.
- Mm-hmm.
And I must say that I miss the laughter.
Oh, God, how they used to laugh with me.
At you.
We gotta figure out a way to hire everybody back.
- A meeting.
- A party.
- No.
We just had a party.
- Yeah, but I didn't get to have any fun.
[Narrator] So Michael went to work on another Christmas party... this time with the help ofhis niece.
[Michael] I appreciate you doing this.
I didn't wanna ask George Michael.
Did you see that he showed up at the party for five minutes and left without saying good-bye?
- Hey, my mom doesn't even wanna be in the same room with me.
- Michael...
I was almost attacked last night in my own home.
I walk in, and there's a colored man in my kitchen.
- "Colored"?
What color was he exactly?
- Blue.
Hello, Lucille.
[Horn Blares]
- I sent him to your house to keep you safe.
- Well, he did a terrible job.
Didn't he?
I need someone else, someone better.
What about this one?
She's got thick arms.
Mom, you just need to calm down a little bit.
You're so tense.
How am I supposed to calm down?
Sounds tense.
That means she's not gettin' any from my brother Oscar.
[Lucille] Maybe I should move in with you.
[Narrator] And Michael realized he needed to retrieve his Uncle Oscar.
How would you like to go on a road trip?
No.
I wanna stay here with her.
Let's go.
[Narrator] And so the two of them prepared to drive up the coast.
You're in charge of the radio, and we're not stopping until we find Uncle Oscar.
There he is.
My mom is very stressed out, and she needs something that I can't give her- um, maybe a little afternoon delight.
[Narrator] Oscar thought that Michael was referring to a particular brand of cannabis... named Afternoon Deelite, a strain famous for slowing behavior.
Well, sure.
The question is... which way do I try to get it in her?
I don't need any details.
- Maybe I'll put it in her brownie.
- Hey!
- What happened to you?
- What?
[Loudly] Oh, oh.
My ears.
The doctor said I can't go to sleep for five hours... or I might die or something.
Oh, I got blown, so I can't sleep.
[Lindsay] Hey, have you seen Maeby?
You're not gonna believe this.
Apparently my dad and Maeby took a drive up the coast.
- You're kidding me.
- [Tobias] Uh-oh.
I should not have picked at that.
- That's blood.
- This is ridiculous.
- So she's got a new parent.
- Yeah.
Now my dad's got a new kid.
I'm gonna lie down for a little bit, but just
- I c
- I can't fall-
Hey, how would you like to come to the party with me today?
[Narrator] And Oscar was giving Lucille a little Afternoon Deelite.
- These are really delicious.
- I'll get some more.
Okay
Mm-hmm
Where did she go?
[Narrator] Soon, the second Bluth Company Christmas party in as many days began.
- You are not fired, sir.
- I really appreciate that.
You got it.
Here you go.
Merry Christmas.
Where the hell is my brother?
[Gob] Sure, the guy in the $600 banana suit.
- Come on!
- Hi.
[Suit Squeaking]
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hey, don't be mad at me... 'cause you didn't think about going out to Tarzana... to get the old banana suit out of storage.
But it's worth it, because it's time for me to make people laugh again.
With me.
And what's funnier than a guy in- Oh
- Hey, wait.
Hey.
[Continues Shouting, Indistinct]
- Okay.
- [Laughter Continues]
[Narrator] Later, Gob was inside the banana stand... and it was getting pretty hot in there, so he decided to lose a layer.
Hey, look.
There's your mom and George Michael.
I guess they did come to support us after all.
Look at that.
They're all over each other with their little secrets.
- What can you do, right?
- Yeah.
How would you feel about singing a little karaoke?
[Narrator] Unfortunately, Lindsay wasn't there to see all of Michael and Maeby's song... and was about to have a similar revelation.
Could not be caught that didn't bite
But you got some bait a-waitin', and I think I might
- Try nibbling a little afternoon delight
- That's my wife and nephew.
- Skyrockets in flight
- We have an open relationship.
[Narrator]Just then, Lucille arrived, craving a frozen banana.
And the effects of Lindsay and George Michael's "Afternoon Delight"was overshadowed-
- Mom?
- by the effects of Oscar and Lucille's Afternoon Deelite.
- Tobias-Tobias, watch out.
- [Narrator] Tobias couldn't hear-
- Tobias!
- and didn't manage to get out of the way in time.
- What the hell was that?
- [Thudding]
[Narrator] And Gob couldn't move freely.
Lucille tried to stop... but the car hit Gob's banana peel.
- [Goofy Laughter] - [Wood Crashing]
I can't get out of here.
I'm stuck.
Mom, are you crazy?
You could've killed somebody.
Hey, Mikey, relax.
It's just a giant banana.
[Narrator] And that's when Buster saw an opportunity to be a hero.
- Gob?
- Mom, I'm stuck!
- [Engine Revving]
- I got you, Brother!
[Giddy Laughter]
[Onlookers Laughing]
[Narrator] And for the second time since he became president...
Gob heard the sweet sound oflaughter.
They're laughing with me, Michael.
They're laughing with me!
[Narrator] Unfortunately, Buster's newfound skills... did not involve lowering gently.
- [Onlookers] Ooh.
Oh.
- [Splash]
Hey, it's Tobias.
Who wants to take me to the hospital?
[Narrator] And so father and son reunited... rebuilding the banana stand for a second time.
- Hey.
Can I give you a hand?
- Hey.
Yeah.
- That would be great.
- Okay.
- Oh, I'm sorry about- It's embarrassing, the whole-
- Listen, I, uh-
I've been a little out of line lately.
You're entitled... to be with your girlfriend, and I guess I got a little bit jealous.
- Yeah.
Well, me too.
- Yeah.
Okay.
[Michael Whistling "Afternoon Delight"]
- Gonna grab some afternoon-
- Afternoon
- It does not seem like it would be that dirty.
- It's
- It is catchy.
Right.
That's the thing.
[Narrator] On the next Arrested Development.
- The Blue Man Group finally calls for Tobias...
- [Phone Ringing]
With a life-changing opportunity.
Unfortunately, he can't hear it, and his life stays the same.
Now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything... and the one son who had no choice... but to keep them all together.
It's Arrested Development.
Michael was using the Bluth Company crane... to retrieve the family-owned frozen banana stand after it had been dumped in the bay... a holiday tradition among the local youth.
- Soon he returned home so that he and his son-
- George Michael?
Could share their holiday tradition of rebuilding it.
- Another one of Dad's suits?
- Hey, I'm the president now.
I'm filling Dad's shoes...
literally, except his shoes don't fit.
But I did finally get into Dad's pants... although I had to have the crotch taken in a little.
You know, Gob, maybe it's the suits, but I think you may be beginning... to alienate some of the employees down at work.
What?
Oh, that's great.
The president has to worry about alienating the employees now.
In fact, Gob had started to alienate some ofhis colleagues.
The worst that could happen is I could spill some on my $3,000 suit.
Come on!
- Hey!
- The guy in the $4,000 suit... is holding the elevator for the guy who doesn't make that in three months.
Why don't I just take a whiz through this $5,000 suit?
Come on!
They like me just fine.
You'll see that tonight... when they toast me at the Christmas party, just like they used to with Dad.
They used to roast Dad 'cause they thought that... he had a sense of humor about himself, but he didn't, and neither do you.
Hey, nobody laughed louder than me at any joke about Dad.
You're the one who's all Mr. "I take myself too seriously all the time. "
Michael did tend to take the Christmas party somewhat seriously.
Merry Christmas.
You can go ahead and put that right in the charity barrel.
Thanks a lot.
Sorry, pal.
We just can't have them resent us.
I know some of the numbers haven't all added up, and there is some speculation... that George has been into the kitty-
"Into the kitty"!
That's awesome.
Fire Tom and get your jackass brother out of here.
This year I'm not officially president, and it'll be nice to actually have some fun... with my son at a Christmas party.
- Thank God I don't have to go.
- So glad to hear you say that.
I wanna meet someone there.
What?
So I'm not invited to the Bluth Company Christmas party?
Oh, honey, of course you can go if you want to.
- Thanks, Mom.
- No.
You're not going to that.
You see, if I show up with you, it'll just make me seem like I'm a mother.
- I've never thought of you that way.
- That's sweet.
Well, I won't be going.
I will be head to toe in blue makeup until 8:01... in case the Blue Man Group needs their understudy, so-
No, no, you have to go.
So when men find out... we're in an open relationship, they'll see you're no threat.
People hear the name Tobias, they think big, black guy.
Well, obviously I'm not a big guy.
I'm not a Carl Weathers, par exemple.
I forgot about Carl.
Is he still single?
Hey, George Michael, I need you to help me fix up the banana stand.
No, I can't.
I was supposed to go to Ann's parents' Christmas party.
- We're makin' yams.
- Tonight?
Tonight is the office party.
Well, did you want me to go to that?
You're always telling me not to have fun at those things.
Yes.
We might even snatch a gift from the charity barrel.
Oh.
Okay, well-well, I think Ann's parents are having their party on Bethlehem time... which is pretty early, so maybe I can make an appearance.
Make an appearance?
Uh
- Uh
- No, no.
It's okay.
- You be with Yam.
It's fine.
It's good.
- It's Ann.
It's good.
Have fun.
The boy's pulling away from you.
Are we having yams?
Yeah, I don't know what's goin' on with him.
You know, he's on Bethlehem time.
He's spending every moment of the day with this girl.
- It's, like, I'm his father.
He should be spending most-
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't get involved.
Believe me.
When I thought your first wife was driving us apart...
I did not make a stink.
You complained all the time, and she was my only wife.
And she died.
Well, see, things have a way of working themselves out.
Nonetheless, it's family first at the holidays.
- Oh, God.
It's Mom again.
- Put it on speakerphone.
I wanna hear her beautiful voice.
Michael!
There's a hole in the window!
There's been a break-in!
- Get over here!
- I'm leaving now.
Sounds tense.
That means she's not gettin' any from my brother, Oscar.
Lovely.
That's nice.
I heard about the banana stand, and now there's been a break-in.
But I have a surprise for whoever it is if he comes back.
First I blow him;
then I poke him.
Guy has no idea what he's in for.
You know, Mom, all the glass seems to be on the outside.
Plus, here's your little statue... so I guess what this says to me is, I doubt anyone was trying to break in, Mom.
If anything, someone was trying to break out.
Where is Oscar?
Well, he's on his walkabout or pilgrimage.
Every year, Oscar attempts the 420-mile walk... from Newport Beach to Berkeley, California.
In the 12 years he's attempted this... he's never made it past U.C. Irvine.
He calls it a quest to recharge his chi.
I call it an excuse for him... to score his pot and wag his pickle at coeds.
You sound mad, Mom, mad enough to throw one of these little lady heads at him.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Well, maybe you're a little bit lonely... and you're acting out for attention.
That's ridiculous.
I want you to move in with me.
What?
No.
No.
No.
No, no, no, no.
Didn't you adopt a child for this very reason?
So that you would never be alone?
Michael, a mother doesn't have a child to give herself company.
- Annyong was to teach Buster a lesson.
- And where is that little lesson?
I sent him to the Milford Academy to teach him a lesson.
I can't remember about what.
And Buster left this morning to finish his army training.
In fact, Lucille had refused to drive him to the army base... so Buster was taking his very first bus ride.
- I can't change a hundred.
- Oh.
Oh, God.
Oh.
And that's when Buster saw something interesting.
That could be good for army.
Whilejust 20 yards away, Michael went to work repairing the banana stand.
What are you doin' here?
My mom signed me out of school early, so she wouldn't have to pick me up later... so she wouldn't be late for the Christmas party.

- I had to drive...
- because she had a little bit of a buzz on.
- No.
That's it.
- You doing this alone?
- Yeah.
Well, thanks.
I guess George Michael's gettin' a little too old to hang out with his dad.
- Yeah, and I'm getting too old for my mom to be with me.
- You know what?
- Maybe we should go to this party together.
- Really?
Yeah.
You're my little niece.
I think we should be spending more time together.
- And if it makes my mom jealous-
- And George Michael can run back to his precious Ann.
Great.
Good deal.
Michael and Maeby stopped by the office to see if Gob needed help... for the party that was now hours away.
...king $6,300 suit!
- Come on!
- Hi there.
- What's she doin' here?
- Merry Christmas to you too, Uncle Gob.
- Everything all right?
- I just don't want people's kids getting their sticky fingers... all over these $2,600 pants.
Oh, yeah?
You think they're gonna go right for the pants?
Okay, okay, okay.
So, should- should- should- should, should, should-
- Shh.
- Should- should- should-
We'll do it your way.
I'm just here to have fun.
Not too much fun, all right?
I already gave my big sexual harassment speech today.
And please refrain from discussing or engaging... in any sort of interoffice-
Or- Or finger-
Or- fisting or-
Or even- even though so many people in this office are begging for it.
And if anybody does anything with my sister Lindsay...
I'll take off my pants, I'll shave-
And I'll personally-

- What are you talking about?
Now?
You're not gonna let these people go home and change their clothes?
I don't think we need people tryin' to compete with what I'm wearing.
Everybody, come out of your offices, please.
The party has now started.
Here we go.
Let's go.
Everybody dance now.
Everybody dance now.
I think we're off to a great start.
And so, Michael started to become relaxed, and a short time later... his mother arrived anything but.
Someone broke in again.
The liquor is gone.
All of it- gone.

In fact, Buster never went to the army.
He'd gotten hooked playing the skill crane and missed his first day.

- Hey, Buster.
Buster!
Thank God you're back!
There's no shame in being a coward.
A coward?
I'm not a coward.
- Would a coward have this?
- What the hell is that?
These are my awards, Mother, from army.
The seal is for marksmanship... and the gorilla is for sand racing.
- You're doing well?
- I was just dropping these off.
Now, if you'll excuse me, they're putting me in something called Hero Squad.

- Bluth Company.
And Lindsay showed up at the Christmas party.
Unfortunately, she didn't realize the employees had been threatened against flirting.
Oh, hello, Ted.
Oh, if you're worried about my husband, it's fine.
He's no bigger than a Cub Scout.
You could take him, and you could certainly take me.
This has been pleasant and professional.
Good luck in the coming business year.
Hey, you guys are sticking stuff on Gob's suit?
- Shh.
Go away.
You're gonna ruin it.
Aunt Lindsay, how's the party?
It is the worst Christmas party I've ever been to in my life.
Yeah.
Watch this.
Yep.
Like my last 10 years.
And my daughter won't give me the time of day.
- How was your party?
- Oh, it was good.
They're kind of religious, Ann's family, so it was-
Yeah, it was just kind of-
The word George Michael was searching for was "creepy. "
Let me give you a hand with that, little fella.
Hey, I was talkin' to the sound guy, and he said he's got this karaoke thing.
- Yeah.
Let's do it.
Put the first song on in the book.
- Okay.
Okay?
Thanks very much.
Hey.
I thought you were at your party.
No, no.
They said I could leave for the second hour of silent prayer.
But Ann and I do have to go back, so I should
- I should go soon.
- Uncle Michael-
- Okay.
I'll be right there.
Sorry.
I gotta go do this.
I'll be right back.
And Michael sang a duet with his niece.
My daughter doesn't need me.
Neither does my dad.
Had George Michael and Lindsay stayed, they might have discovered... what Michael and Maeby did- that "Afternoon Delight"was more adult-themed... than its innocent melody would have you believe.
- Hang on, Maeby.
Listen.
I'm gonna go get some more punch, because it is toast time.
Okay?
No, no, no.
It'll look worse.
Go that way.
So, let's toast me.
Who's first?
Huh.
Tom, why don't you come up here and talk about me for a few minutes?
Uh, I wanna thank the Bluth family for hiring me back.
It's been a tough couple years.
- My brother did that.
Talk about me.
- Oh, okay.
Uh, you certainly do love those suits.
At seven grand, you'd better believe I love 'em.
I mean, look at what you're wearing.
You look like crap.
I mean, at least this is-
Who did this?
You do this, Tom?
- No.
- You're a real smart-ass.
You know that, Tom?
Look, I don't know him very well... but Gob seems like he'd be a really smart boss.
Please don't laugh.
Look, he's a great magician.
- That's even better!
- you, Tom.
- Please don't.
- You know what?
You're fired.
No.
You're all fired, each and every one of you.
Merry Christmas.
I didn't know the lyrics.
Where's everybody goin'?
- We don't work here anymore.
- What?
Is your sister still around?
The Christmas party had been a disaster.
I did the right thing, Michael.
If I don't fire them, how do I teach a lesson to the others?
- There are no others.
You fired everyone.
- Oh, that- that's great.
The guy who's dirty dancing with his niece is gonna tell the guy in the $3,600 suit... how to run the business.
- Come on.
- I know.
Maybe we're better off... with me being businesslike and you being the good-time, useless party guy.
- It got us this far.
- Mm-hmm.
And I must say that I miss the laughter.
Oh, God, how they used to laugh with me.
At you.
We gotta figure out a way to hire everybody back.
- A meeting.
- A party.
- No.
We just had a party.
- Yeah, but I didn't get to have any fun.
So Michael went to work on another Christmas party... this time with the help ofhis niece.
I appreciate you doing this.
I didn't wanna ask George Michael.
Did you see that he showed up at the party for five minutes and left without saying good-bye?
- Hey, my mom doesn't even wanna be in the same room with me.
- Michael...
I was almost attacked last night in my own home.
I walk in, and there's a colored man in my kitchen.
- "Colored"?
What color was he exactly?
- Blue.
Hello, Lucille.
- I sent him to your house to keep you safe.
- Well, he did a terrible job.
Didn't he?
I need someone else, someone better.
What about this one?
She's got thick arms.
Mom, you just need to calm down a little bit.
You're so tense.
How am I supposed to calm down?
Sounds tense.
That means she's not gettin' any from my brother Oscar.
Maybe I should move in with you.
And Michael realized he needed to retrieve his Uncle Oscar.
How would you like to go on a road trip?
No.
I wanna stay here with her.
Let's go.
And so the two of them prepared to drive up the coast.
You're in charge of the radio, and we're not stopping until we find Uncle Oscar.
There he is.
My mom is very stressed out, and she needs something that I can't give her- um, maybe a little afternoon delight.
Oscar thought that Michael was referring to a particular brand of cannabis... named Afternoon Deelite, a strain famous for slowing behavior.
Well, sure.
The question is... which way do I try to get it in her?
I don't need any details.
- Maybe I'll put it in her brownie.
- Hey!
- What happened to you?
- What?
Oh, oh.
My ears.
The doctor said I can't go to sleep for five hours... or I might die or something.
Oh, I got blown, so I can't sleep.
Hey, have you seen Maeby?
You're not gonna believe this.
Apparently my dad and Maeby took a drive up the coast.
- You're kidding me.
- Uh-oh.
I should not have picked at that.
- That's blood.
- This is ridiculous.
- So she's got a new parent.
- Yeah.
Now my dad's got a new kid.
I'm gonna lie down for a little bit, but just
- I c
- I can't fall-
Hey, how would you like to come to the party with me today?
And Oscar was giving Lucille a little Afternoon Deelite.
- These are really delicious.
- I'll get some more.
Okay
Mm-hmm
Where did she go?
Soon, the second Bluth Company Christmas party in as many days began.
- You are not fired, sir.
- I really appreciate that.
You got it.
Here you go.
Merry Christmas.
Where the hell is my brother?
Sure, the guy in the $600 banana suit.
- Come on!
- Hi.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hey, don't be mad at me... 'cause you didn't think about going out to Tarzana... to get the old banana suit out of storage.
But it's worth it, because it's time for me to make people laugh again.
With me.
And what's funnier than a guy in- Oh
- Hey, wait.
Hey.
Okay.
Later, Gob was inside the banana stand... and it was getting pretty hot in there, so he decided to lose a layer.
Hey, look.
There's your mom and George Michael.
I guess they did come to support us after all.
Look at that.
They're all over each other with their little secrets.
- What can you do, right?
- Yeah.
How would you feel about singing a little karaoke?
Unfortunately, Lindsay wasn't there to see all of Michael and Maeby's song... and was about to have a similar revelation.
Could not be caught that didn't bite
But you got some bait a-waitin', and I think I might
- Try nibbling a little afternoon delight
- That's my wife and nephew.
- Skyrockets in flight
- We have an open relationship.
Just then, Lucille arrived, craving a frozen banana.
And the effects of Lindsay and George Michael's "Afternoon Delight"was overshadowed-
- Mom?
- by the effects of Oscar and Lucille's Afternoon Deelite.
- Tobias-Tobias, watch out.
- Tobias couldn't hear-
- Tobias!
- and didn't manage to get out of the way in time.
What the hell was that?
And Gob couldn't move freely.
Lucille tried to stop... but the car hit Gob's banana peel.
I can't get out of here.
I'm stuck.
Mom, are you crazy?
You could've killed somebody.
Hey, Mikey, relax.
It's just a giant banana.
And that's when Buster saw an opportunity to be a hero.
- Gob?
- Mom, I'm stuck!
I got you, Brother!
And for the second time since he became president...
Gob heard the sweet sound oflaughter.
They're laughing with me, Michael.
They're laughing with me!
Unfortunately, Buster's newfound skills... did not involve lowering gently.
Ooh.
Oh.
Hey, it's Tobias.
Who wants to take me to the hospital?
And so father and son reunited... rebuilding the banana stand for a second time.
- Hey.
Can I give you a hand?
- Hey.
Yeah.
- That would be great.
- Okay.
- Oh, I'm sorry about
- It's embarrassing, the whole-
- Listen, I, uh-
I've been a little out of line lately.
You're entitled... to be with your girlfriend, and I guess I got a little bit jealous.
- Yeah.
Well, me too.
- Yeah.
Okay.
- Gonna grab some afternoon-
- Afternoon
- It does not seem like it would be that dirty.
- It's
- It is catchy.
Right.
That's the thing.
On the next Arrested Development.
The Blue Man Group finally calls for Tobias...
With a life-changing opportunity.
Unfortunately, he can't hear it, and his life stays the same.
Now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything... and the one son who had no choice... but to keep them all together.
It's Arrested Development.
[Man Narrating] Michael was using the Bluth Company crane... to retrieve the family-owned frozen banana stand after it had been dumped in the bay... a holiday tradition among the local youth.
- Soon he returned home so that he and his son-
- George Michael?
Could share their holiday tradition of rebuilding it.
- Another one of Dad's suits?
- Hey, I'm the president now.
I'm filling Dad's shoes...
literally, except his shoes don't fit.
But I did finally get into Dad's pants... although I had to have the crotch taken in a little.
You know, Gob, maybe it's the suits, but I think you may be beginning... to alienate some of the employees down at work.
What?
Oh, that's great.
The president has to worry about alienating the employees now.
[Narrator] In fact, Gob had started to alienate some ofhis colleagues.
The worst that could happen is I could spill some on my $3,000 suit.
Come on!
- Hey!
- The guy in the $4,000 suit... is holding the elevator for the guy who doesn't make that in three months.
Why don't I just take a whiz through this $5,000 suit?
Come on!
They like me just fine.
You'll see that tonight... when they toast me at the Christmas party, just like they used to with Dad.
They used to roast Dad 'cause they thought that... he had a sense of humor about himself, but he didn't, and neither do you.
Hey, nobody laughed louder than me at any joke about Dad.
You're the one who's all Mr. "I take myself too seriously all the time."
[Narrator] Michael did tend to take the Christmas party somewhat seriously.
Merry Christmas.
You can go ahead and put that right in the charity barrel.
Thanks a lot.
Sorry, pal.
We just can't have them resent us.
I know some of the numbers haven't all added up, and there is some speculation... that George has been into the kitty [Laughter] - "Into the kitty"!
That's awesome.
[Whispering] Fire Tom and get your jackass brother out of here.
This year I'm not officially president, and it'll be nice to actually have some fun... with my son at a Christmas party.
- Thank God I don't have to go.
- So glad to hear you say that.
I wanna meet someone there.
What?
So I'm not invited to the Bluth Company Christmas party?
Oh, honey, of course you can go if you want to.
- Thanks, Mom.
- No.
You're not going to that.
You see, if I show up with you, it'll just make me seem like I'm a mother.
- I've never thought of you that way.
- That's sweet.
Well, I won't be going.
I will be head to toe in blue makeup until 8:01... in case the Blue Man Group needs their understudy, so-
No, no, you have to go.
So when men find out... we're in an open relationship, they'll see you're no threat.
People hear the name Tobias, they think big, black guy.
Well, obviously I'm not a big guy.
I'm not a Carl Weathers, par exemple.
I forgot about Carl.
Is he still single?
Hey, George Michael, I need you to help me fix up the banana stand.
No, I can't.
I was supposed to go to Ann's parents' Christmas party.
- We're makin' yams.
- Tonight?
Tonight is the office party.
Well, did you want me to go to that?
You're always telling me not to have fun at those things.
Yes.
We might even snatch a gift from the charity barrel.
Oh.
Okay, well-well, I think Ann's parents are having their party on Bethlehem time... which is pretty early, so maybe I can make an appearance.
Make an appearance?
Uh
- Uh
- No, no.
It's okay.
- You be with Yam.
It's fine.
It's good.
- It's Ann.
It's good.
Have fun.
The boy's pulling away from you.
Are we having yams?
Yeah, I don't know what's goin' on with him.
You know, he's on Bethlehem time.
He's spending every moment of the day with this girl.
- It's, like, I'm his father.
He should be spending most-
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't get involved.
Believe me.
When I thought your first wife was driving us apart...
I did not make a stink.
You complained all the time, and she was my only wife.
And she died.
Well, see, things have a way of working themselves out.
- [Phone Ringing]
- Nonetheless, it's family first at the holidays.
- Oh, God.
It's Mom again.
- Put it on speakerphone.
I wanna hear her beautiful voice.
[Screams] Michael!
There's a hole in the window!
There's been a break-in!
- Get over here!
- I'm leaving now.
Sounds tense.
That means she's not gettin' any from my brother, Oscar.
Lovely.
That's nice.
I heard about the banana stand, and now there's been a break-in.
But I have a surprise for whoever it is if he comes back.
First I blow him;
then I poke him.
Guy has no idea what he's in for.
You know, Mom, all the glass seems to be on the outside.
Plus, here's your little statue... so I guess what this says to me is, I doubt anyone was trying to break in, Mom.
If anything, someone was trying to break out.
Where is Oscar?
Well, he's on his walkabout or pilgrimage.
[Narrator] Every year, Oscar attempts the 420-mile walk... from Newport Beach to Berkeley, California.
In the 12 years he's attempted this... he's never made it past U.C. Irvine.
He calls it a quest to recharge his chi.
I call it an excuse for him... to score his pot and wag his pickle at coeds.
You sound mad, Mom, mad enough to throw one of these little lady heads at him.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Well, maybe you're a little bit lonely... and you're acting out for attention.
That's ridiculous.
I want you to move in with me.
What?
No.
No.
No.
No, no, no, no.
Didn't you adopt a child for this very reason?
So that you would never be alone?
Michael, a mother doesn't have a child to give herself company.
- Annyong was to teach Buster a lesson.
- And where is that little lesson?
I sent him to the Milford Academy to teach him a lesson.
I can't remember about what.
And Buster left this morning to finish his army training.
[Narrator] In fact, Lucille had refused to drive him to the army base... so Buster was taking his very first bus ride.
- I can't change a hundred.
- Oh.
Oh, God.
Oh.
[Narrator] And that's when Buster saw something interesting.
That could be good for army.
[Laughs]
[Imitates Whirring Crane]
[Narrator] Whilejust 20 yards away, Michael went to work repairing the banana stand.
[Michael] What are you doin' here?
My mom signed me out of school early, so she wouldn't have to pick me up later... so she wouldn't be late for the Christmas party.
- That's about the worst thing I've ever heard.
- I had to drive...
- because she had a little bit of a buzz on.
- No.
That's it.
- You doing this alone?
- Yeah.
Well, thanks.
I guess George Michael's gettin' a little too old to hang out with his dad.
- Yeah, and I'm getting too old for my mom to be with me.
- You know what?
- Maybe we should go to this party together.
- Really?
Yeah.
You're my little niece.
I think we should be spending more time together.
- And if it makes my mom jealous-
- And George Michael can run back to his precious Ann.
Great.
Good deal.
[Bells Jingling]
[Narrator] Michael and Maeby stopped by the office to see if Gob needed help... for the party that was now hours away.
...king $6,300 suit!
- Come on!
- Hi there.
- What's she doin' here?
- Merry Christmas to you too, Uncle Gob.
- Everything all right?
- I just don't want people's kids getting their sticky fingers... all over these $2,600 pants.
Oh, yeah?
You think they're gonna go right for the pants?
Okay, okay, okay.
So, should- should- should- should, should, should-
- Shh.
- Should- should- should-
We'll do it your way.
I'm just here to have fun.
Not too much fun, all right?
I already gave my big sexual harassment speech today.
And please refrain from discussing or engaging... in any sort of interoffice- [Bleeps]
Or-[Bleeps] Or finger-[Bleeps]
Or- [Bleeps] fisting or- [Bleeps]
Or even- [Bleeps] even though so many people in this office are begging for it.
And if anybody does anything with my sister Lindsay...
I'll take off my pants, I'll shave-[Bleeps]
And I'll personally- [Long Bleep]
- Let's get this going.
- What are you talking about?
Now?
You're not gonna let these people go home and change their clothes?
I don't think we need people tryin' to compete with what I'm wearing.
Everybody, come out of your offices, please.
The party has now started.
- Here we go.
Let's go.
- [Stereo:
Disco]
Everybody dance now.
[Over Microphone] Everybody dance now.
I think we're off to a great start.
[Narrator] And so, Michael started to become relaxed, and a short time later... his mother arrived anything but.
Someone broke in again.
The liquor is gone.
All of it- gone.
[Narrator] In fact, Gob had stolen it earlier that day... to cut down on the cost of the party.
- Hey, need a hand with that?
- No, Al.
I wanna spill booze all over my f-
- I'm all alone there, Michael.
- You know, Buster's only stationed about five miles away.
[Narrator] In fact, Buster never went to the army.
- He'd gotten hooked playing the skill crane and missed his first day.
- [Trilling]
- Somewhat ashamed and with nowhere to go, he returned home.
- Hey, Buster.
- [Door Closes] - [Gasps] Buster!
Thank God you're back!
There's no shame in being a coward.
A coward?
I'm not a coward.
- Would a coward have this?
- What the hell is that?
These are my awards, Mother, from army.
The seal is for marksmanship... and the gorilla is for sand racing.
- You're doing well?
- I was just dropping these off.
Now, if you'll excuse me, they're putting me in something called Hero Squad.
You have no idea what it's like to be abandoned by your son.
Do you see my son?
He chose his girlfriend over me.
How the worm has turned.
Look who feels the sting of an ungrateful child.
Mother, you have to receive something to be ungrateful.
I'm not gettin' worked up over it tonight.
I'm not gonna let anything bother me.
Good.
I'll get a drink and then go home and wait for you to come stay with me.
Thank God they've got my brands here.
[Narrator] This was an unacceptable solution.
Hey, Tobias, it's Michael.
I hope you get this.
I need you to go over to my mother's tonight.
[Narrator] Unfortunately, Tobias missed the call... and it went through to Michael's home voice mail.
- The Blue Men!
- [Phone Beeps]
[Voice On Phone] You have 101 unheard messages.
First message.
- Michael, it's your mother- - [Beep]
- Michael, pick up.
- [Beep]
- Happy Thanksgiving
- Michael, it's Mother-
- Michael, pick up- - [Beep]
- [Michael On Phone] Hey, Tobias, it's Michael.
- [Groans] Bluth Company.
[Narrator] And Lindsay showed up at the Christmas party.
Unfortunately, she didn't realize the employees had been threatened against flirting.
Oh, hello, Ted.
Oh, if you're worried about my husband, it's fine.
He's no bigger than a Cub Scout.
You could take him, and you could certainly take me.
This has been pleasant and professional.
Good luck in the coming business year.
- [Chuckles] Hey, you guys are sticking stuff on Gob's suit?
- Shh.
Go away.
You're gonna ruin it.
Aunt Lindsay, how's the party?
It is the worst Christmas party I've ever been to in my life.
Yeah.
Watch this.
[Sucks Teeth]
Yep.
Like my last 10 years.
And my daughter won't give me the time of day.
- How was your party?
- Oh, it was good.
They're kind of religious, Ann's family, so it was-
Yeah, it was just kind of-
[Narrator] The word George Michael was searching for was "creepy."
- [Piano] - [Singing Hymn In German]
[Ann Singing Loudly, Out OfTune]
Let me give you a hand with that, little fella.
[Continuing In German]
Hey, I was talkin' to the sound guy, and he said he's got this karaoke thing.
- Yeah.
Let's do it.
Put the first song on in the book.
- Okay.
Okay?
Thanks very much.
Hey.
I thought you were at your party.
No, no.
They said I could leave for the second hour of silent prayer.
But Ann and I do have to go back, so I should
- I should go soon.
- [Amplified] Uncle Michael-
- Okay.
I'll be right there.
Sorry.
I gotta go do this.
I'll be right back.
- [Narrator] And Michael sang a duet with his niece.
[Out OfTune]
- [Maeby Singing Out Of Tune]
- My daughter doesn't need me.
Neither does my dad.
[Narrator] Had George Michael and Lindsay stayed, they might have discovered... what Michael and Maeby did- that "Afternoon Delight"was more adult-themed... than its innocent melody would have you believe.
- [Michael Trails Off]
- Hang on, Maeby.
[Embarrassed Chuckle] Listen.
I'm gonna go get some more punch, because it is toast time.
Okay?
No, no, no.
It'll look worse.
Go that way.
So, let's toast me.
Who's first?
Huh.
Tom, why don't you come up here and talk about me for a few minutes?
Uh, I wanna thank the Bluth family for hiring me back.
It's been a tough couple years.
- My brother did that.
Talk about me.
- Oh, okay.
Uh, you certainly do love those suits.
At seven grand, you'd better believe I love 'em.
I mean, look at what you're wearing.
You look like crap.
I mean, at least this is-
[Grunts] Who did this?
- [All Snickering]
- You do this, Tom?
- No.
- You're a real smart-ass.
You know that, Tom?
Look, I don't know him very well... but Gob seems like he'd be a really smart boss.
- [Laughter]
- Please don't laugh.
- Look, he's a great magician.
- [Hysterical Laughter]
- [Man] That's even better!
- [Bleeps] you, Tom.
- Please don't.
- You know what?
You're fired.
No.
You're all fired, each and every one of you.
Merry Christmas.
I didn't know the lyrics.
Where's everybody goin'?
- We don't work here anymore.

I was almost attacked last night in my own home.

- "Colored"?
What color was he exactly?
- Blue.
Hello, Lucille.
[Horn Blares]
- I sent him to your house to keep you safe.
- Well, he did a terrible job.
Didn't he?
I need someone else, someone better.
What about this one?
She's got thick arms.
Mom, you just need to calm down a little bit.
You're so tense.
How am I supposed to calm down?
Sounds tense.
That means she's not gettin' any from my brother Oscar.
[Lucille] Maybe I should move in with you.

How would you like to go on a road trip?
No.
I wanna stay here with her.
Let's go.

Here you go.
Merry Christmas.
Where the hell is my brother?
[Gob] Sure, the guy in the $600 banana suit.
- Come on!
- Hi.
[Suit Squeaking]
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hey, don't be mad at me... 'cause you didn't think about going out to Tarzana... to get the old banana suit out of storage.
But it's worth it, because it's time for me to make people laugh again.
With me.
And what's funnier than a guy in- Oh
- Hey, wait.
Hey.
[Continues Shouting, Indistinct]
- Okay.
- [Laughter Continues]
[Narrator] Later, Gob was inside the banana stand... and it was getting pretty hot in there, so he decided to lose a layer.
Hey, look.
There's your mom and George Michael.
I guess they did come to support us after all.
Look at that.
They're all over each other with their little secrets.
- What can you do, right?
- Yeah.
How would you feel about singing a little karaoke?
[Narrator] Unfortunately, Lindsay wasn't there to see all of Michael and Maeby's song... and was about to have a similar revelation.
Could not be caught that didn't bite
But you got some bait a-waitin', and I think I might
- Try nibbling a little afternoon delight
- That's my wife and nephew.
- Skyrockets in flight
- We have an open relationship.
[Narrator]Just then, Lucille arrived, craving a frozen banana.
And the effects of Lindsay and George Michael's "Afternoon Delight"was overshadowed-
- Mom?
- by the effects of Oscar and Lucille's Afternoon Deelite.
- Tobias-Tobias, watch out.
- [Narrator] Tobias couldn't hear-
- Tobias!
- and didn't manage to get out of the way in time.
- What the hell was that?
- [Thudding]
[Narrator] And Gob couldn't move freely.
Lucille tried to stop... but the car hit Gob's banana peel.
- [Goofy Laughter] - [Wood Crashing]
I can't get out of here.
I'm stuck.
Mom, are you crazy?
You could've killed somebody.
Hey, Mikey, relax.
It's just a giant banana.
[Narrator] And that's when Buster saw an opportunity to be a hero.
- Gob?
- Mom, I'm stuck!
- [Engine Revving]
- I got you, Brother!
[Giddy Laughter]
[Onlookers Laughing]
[Narrator] And for the second time since he became president...
Gob heard the sweet sound oflaughter.
They're laughing with me, Michael.
They're laughing with me!
[Narrator] Unfortunately, Buster's newfound skills... did not involve lowering gently.
- [Onlookers] Ooh.
Oh.
- [Splash]
Hey, it's Tobias.
Who wants to take me to the hospital?
[Narrator] And so father and son reunited... rebuilding the banana stand for a second time.
- Hey.
Can I give you a hand?
- Hey.
Yeah.
- That would be great.
- Okay.
- Oh, I'm sorry about- It's embarrassing, the whole-
- Listen, I, uh-
I've been a little out of line lately.
You're entitled... to be with your girlfriend, and I guess I got a little bit jealous.
- Yeah.
Well, me too.
- Yeah.
Okay.
[Michael Whistling "Afternoon Delight"]
- Gonna grab some afternoon-
- Afternoon
- It does not seem like it would be that dirty.
- It's
- It is catchy.
Right.
That's the thing.
[Narrator] On the next Arrested Development.
- The Blue Man Group finally calls for Tobias...
- [Phone Ringing]
With a life-changing opportunity.
Unfortunately, he can't hear it, and his life stays the same.
Now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything... and the one son who had no choice... but to keep them all together.
It's Arrested Development.
Michael was using the Bluth Company crane... to retrieve the family-owned frozen banana stand after it had been dumped in the bay... a holiday tradition among the local youth.
- Soon he returned home so that he and his son-
- George Michael?
Could share their holiday tradition of rebuilding it.
- Another one of Dad's suits?
- Hey, I'm the president now.
I'm filling Dad's shoes...
literally, except his shoes don't fit.
But I did finally get into Dad's pants... although I had to have the crotch taken in a little.
You know, Gob, maybe it's the suits, but I think you may be beginning... to alienate some of the employees down at work.
What?
Oh, that's great.
The president has to worry about alienating the employees now.
In fact, Gob had started to alienate some ofhis colleagues.
The worst that could happen is I could spill some on my $3,000 suit.
Come on!
- Hey!
- The guy in the $4,000 suit... is holding the elevator for the guy who doesn't make that in three months.
Why don't I just take a whiz through this $5,000 suit?
Come on!
They like me just fine.
You'll see that tonight... when they toast me at the Christmas party, just like they used to with Dad.
They used to roast Dad 'cause they thought that... he had a sense of humor about himself, but he didn't, and neither do you.
Hey, nobody laughed louder than me at any joke about Dad.
You're the one who's all Mr. "I take myself too seriously all the time."
Michael did tend to take the Christmas party somewhat seriously.
Merry Christmas.
You can go ahead and put that right in the charity barrel.
Thanks a lot.
Sorry, pal.
We just can't have them resent us.
I know some of the numbers haven't all added up, and there is some speculation... that George has been into the kitty-
"Into the kitty"!
That's awesome.
Fire Tom and get your jackass brother out of here.
This year I'm not officially president, and it'll be nice to actually have some fun... with my son at a Christmas party.
- Thank God I don't have to go.
- So glad to hear you say that.
I wanna meet someone there.
What?
So I'm not invited to the Bluth Company Christmas party?
Oh, honey, of course you can go if you want to.
- Thanks, Mom.
- No.
You're not going to that.
You see, if I show up with you, it'll just make me seem like I'm a mother.
- I've never thought of you that way.
- That's sweet.
Well, I won't be going.
I will be head to toe in blue makeup until 8:01... in case the Blue Man Group needs their understudy, so-
No, no, you have to go.
So when men find out... we're in an open relationship, they'll see you're no threat.
People hear the name Tobias, they think big, black guy.
Well, obviously I'm not a big guy.
I'm not a Carl Weathers, par exemple.
I forgot about Carl.
Is he still single?
Hey, George Michael, I need you to help me fix up the banana stand.
No, I can't.
I was supposed to go to Ann's parents' Christmas party.
- We're makin' yams.
- Tonight?
Tonight is the office party.
Well, did you want me to go to that?
You're always telling me not to have fun at those things.
Yes.
We might even snatch a gift from the charity barrel.
Oh.
Okay, well-well, I think Ann's parents are having their party on Bethlehem time... which is pretty early, so maybe I can make an appearance.
Make an appearance?
Uh
- Uh
- No, no.
It's okay.
- You be with Yam.
It's fine.
It's good.
- It's Ann.
It's good.
Have fun.
The boy's pulling away from you.
Are we having yams?
Yeah, I don't know what's goin' on with him.
You know, he's on Bethlehem time.
He's spending every moment of the day with this girl.
- It's, like, I'm his father.
He should be spending most-
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't get involved.
Believe me.
When I thought your first wife was driving us apart...
I did not make a stink.
You complained all the time, and she was my only wife.
And she died.
Well, see, things have a way of working themselves out.
Nonetheless, it's family first at the holidays.
- Oh, God.
It's Mom again.
- Put it on speakerphone.
I wanna hear her beautiful voice.
Michael!
There's a hole in the window!
There's been a break-in!
- Get over here!
- I'm leaving now.
Sounds tense.
That means she's not gettin' any from my brother, Oscar.
Lovely.
That's nice.
I heard about the banana stand, and now there's been a break-in.
But I have a surprise for whoever it is if he comes back.
First I blow him;
then I poke him.
Guy has no idea what he's in for.
You know, Mom, all the glass seems to be on the outside.
Plus, here's your little statue... so I guess what this says to me is, I doubt anyone was trying to break in, Mom.
If anything, someone was trying to break out.
Where is Oscar?
Well, he's on his walkabout or pilgrimage.
Every year, Oscar attempts the 420-mile walk... from Newport Beach to Berkeley, California.
In the 12 years he's attempted this... he's never made it past U.C. Irvine.
He calls it a quest to recharge his chi.
I call it an excuse for him... to score his pot and wag his pickle at coeds.
You sound mad, Mom, mad enough to throw one of these little lady heads at him.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Well, maybe you're a little bit lonely... and you're acting out for attention.
That's ridiculous.
I want you to move in with me.
What?
No.
No.
No.
No, no, no, no.
Didn't you adopt a child for this very reason?
So that you would never be alone?
Michael, a mother doesn't have a child to give herself company.
- Annyong was to teach Buster a lesson.
- And where is that little lesson?
I sent him to the Milford Academy to teach him a lesson.
I can't remember about what.
And Buster left this morning to finish his army training.
In fact, Lucille had refused to drive him to the army base... so Buster was taking his very first bus ride.
- I can't change a hundred.
- Oh.
Oh, God.
Oh.
And that's when Buster saw something interesting.
That could be good for army.
Whilejust 20 yards away, Michael went to work repairing the banana stand.
What are you doin' here?
My mom signed me out of school early, so she wouldn't have to pick me up later... so she wouldn't be late for the Christmas party.
- That's about the worst thing I've ever heard.
- I had to drive...
- because she had a little bit of a buzz on.
- No.
That's it.
- You doing this alone?
- Yeah.
Well, thanks.
I guess George Michael's gettin' a little too old to hang out with his dad.
- Yeah, and I'm getting too old for my mom to be with me.
- You know what?
- Maybe we should go to this party together.
- Really?
Yeah.
You're my little niece.
I think we should be spending more time together.
- And if it makes my mom jealous-
- And George Michael can run back to his precious Ann.
Great.
Good deal.
Michael and Maeby stopped by the office to see if Gob needed help... for the party that was now hours away.
...king $6,300 suit!
- Come on!
- Hi there.
- What's she doin' here?
- Merry Christmas to you too, Uncle Gob.
- Everything all right?
- I just don't want people's kids getting their sticky fingers... all over these $2,600 pants.
Oh, yeah?
You think they're gonna go right for the pants?
Okay, okay, okay.
So, should- should- should- should, should, should-
- Shh.
- Should- should- should-
We'll do it your way.
I'm just here to have fun.
Not too much fun, all right?
I already gave my big sexual harassment speech today.
And please refrain from discussing or engaging... in any sort of interoffice-
Or- Or finger-
Or- fisting or-
Or even- even though so many people in this office are begging for it.
And if anybody does anything with my sister Lindsay...
I'll take off my pants, I'll shave-
And I'll personally-
- Let's get this going.
- What are you talking about?
Now?
You're not gonna let these people go home and change their clothes?
I don't think we need people tryin' to compete with what I'm wearing.
Everybody, come out of your offices, please.
The party has now started.
Here we go.
Let's go.
Everybody dance now.
Everybody dance now.
I think we're off to a great start.
And so, Michael started to become relaxed, and a short time later... his mother arrived anything but.
Someone broke in again.
The liquor is gone.
All of it- gone.
In fact, Gob had stolen it earlier that day... to cut down on the cost of the party.
- Hey, need a hand with that?
- No, Al.
I wanna spill booze all over my f-
- I'm all alone there, Michael.
- You know, Buster's only stationed about five miles away.
In fact, Buster never went to the army.
He'd gotten hooked playing the skill crane and missed his first day.
- Somewhat ashamed and with nowhere to go, he returned home.
- Hey, Buster.
Buster!
Thank God you're back!
There's no shame in being a coward.
A coward?
I'm not a coward.
- Would a coward have this?
- What the hell is that?
These are my awards, Mother, from army.
The seal is for marksmanship... and the gorilla is for sand racing.
- You're doing well?
- I was just dropping these off.
Now, if you'll excuse me, they're putting me in something called Hero Squad.
You have no idea what it's like to be abandoned by your son.
Do you see my son?
He chose his girlfriend over me.
How the worm has turned.
Look who feels the sting of an ungrateful child.
Mother, you have to receive something to be ungrateful.
I'm not gettin' worked up over it tonight.
I'm not gonna let anything bother me.
Good.
I'll get a drink and then go home and wait for you to come stay with me.
Thank God they've got my brands here.
This was an unacceptable solution.
Hey, Tobias, it's Michael.
I hope you get this.
I need you to go over to my mother's tonight.
Unfortunately, Tobias missed the call... and it went through to Michael's home voice mail.
The Blue Men!
You have 101 unheard messages.
First message.
- Michael, it's your mother-
- Michael, pick up.
Happy Thanksgiving
- Michael, it's Mother-
Michael, pick up-
- Hey, Tobias, it's Michael.
- Bluth Company.
And Lindsay showed up at the Christmas party.
Unfortunately, she didn't realize the employees had been threatened against flirting.
Oh, hello, Ted.
Oh, if you're worried about my husband, it's fine.
He's no bigger than a Cub Scout.
You could take him, and you could certainly take me.
This has been pleasant and professional.
Good luck in the coming business year.
Hey, you guys are sticking stuff on Gob's suit?
- Shh.
Go away.
You're gonna ruin it.
Aunt Lindsay, how's the party?
It is the worst Christmas party I've ever been to in my life.
Yeah.
Watch this.
Yep.
Like my last 10 years.
And my daughter won't give me the time of day.
- How was your party?
- Oh, it was good.
They're kind of religious, Ann's family, so it was-
Yeah, it was just kind of-
The word George Michael was searching for was "creepy."
Let me give you a hand with that, little fella.
Hey, I was talkin' to the sound guy, and he said he's got this karaoke thing.
- Yeah.
Let's do it.
Put the first song on in the book.
- Okay.
Okay?
Thanks very much.
Hey.
I thought you were at your party.
No, no.
They said I could leave for the second hour of silent prayer.
But Ann and I do have to go back, so I should
- I should go soon.
- Uncle Michael-
- Okay.
I'll be right there.
Sorry.
I gotta go do this.
I'll be right back.
And Michael sang a duet with his niece.
My daughter doesn't need me.
Neither does my dad.
Had George Michael and Lindsay stayed, they might have discovered... what Michael and Maeby did- that "Afternoon Delight"was more adult-themed... than its innocent melody would have you believe.
- Hang on, Maeby.
Listen.
I'm gonna go get some more punch, because it is toast time.
Okay?
No, no, no.
It'll look worse.
Go that way.
So, let's toast me.
Who's first?
Huh.
Tom, why don't you come up here and talk about me for a few minutes?
Uh, I wanna thank the Bluth family for hiring me back.
It's been a tough couple years.
- My brother did that.
Talk about me.
- Oh, okay.
Uh, you certainly do love those suits.
At seven grand, you'd better believe I love 'em.
I mean, look at what you're wearing.
You look like crap.
I mean, at least this is-
Who did this?
You do this, Tom?
- No.
- You're a real smart-ass.
You know that, Tom?
Look, I don't know him very well... but Gob seems like he'd be a really smart boss.
Please don't laugh.
Look, he's a great magician.
- That's even better!
- you, Tom.
- Please don't.
- You know what?
You're fired.
No.
You're all fired, each and every one of you.
Merry Christmas.
I didn't know the lyrics.
Where's everybody goin'?
- We don't work here anymore.
- What?
Is your sister still around?
The Christmas party had been a disaster.
I did the right thing, Michael.
If I don't fire them, how do I teach a lesson to the others?
- There are no others.
You fired everyone.
- Oh, that- that's great.
The guy who's dirty dancing with his niece is gonna tell the guy in the $3,600 suit... how to run the business.
- Come on.
- I know.
Maybe we're better off... with me being businesslike and you being the good-time, useless party guy.
- It got us this far.
- Mm-hmm.
And I must say that I miss the laughter.
Oh, God, how they used to laugh with me.
At you.
We gotta figure out a way to hire everybody back.
- A meeting.
- A party.
- No.
We just had a party.
- Yeah, but I didn't get to have any fun.
So Michael went to work on another Christmas party... this time with the help ofhis niece.
I appreciate you doing this.
I didn't wanna ask George Michael.
Did you see that he showed up at the party for five minutes and left without saying good-bye?
- Hey, my mom doesn't even wanna be in the same room with me.
- Michael...
I was almost attacked last night in my own home.
I walk in, and there's a colored man in my kitchen.
- "Colored"?
What color was he exactly?
- Blue.
Hello, Lucille.
- I sent him to your house to keep you safe.
- Well, he did a terrible job.
Didn't he?
I need someone else, someone better.
What about this one?
She's got thick arms.
Mom, you just need to calm down a little bit.
You're so tense.
How am I supposed to calm down?
Sounds tense.
That means she's not gettin' any from my brother Oscar.
Maybe I should move in with you.
And Michael realized he needed to retrieve his Uncle Oscar.
How would you like to go on a road trip?
No.
I wanna stay here with her.
Let's go.
And so the two of them prepared to drive up the coast.
You're in charge of the radio, and we're not stopping until we find Uncle Oscar.
There he is.
My mom is very stressed out, and she needs something that I can't give her- um, maybe a little afternoon delight.
Oscar thought that Michael was referring to a particular brand of cannabis... named Afternoon Deelite, a strain famous for slowing behavior.
Well, sure.
The question is... which way do I try to get it in her?
I don't need any details.
- Maybe I'll put it in her brownie.
- Hey!
- What happened to you?
- What?
Oh, oh.
My ears.
The doctor said I can't go to sleep for five hours... or I might die or something.
Oh, I got blown, so I can't sleep.
Hey, have you seen Maeby?
You're not gonna believe this.
Apparently my dad and Maeby took a drive up the coast.
- You're kidding me.
- Uh-oh.
I should not have picked at that.
- That's blood.
- This is ridiculous.
- So she's got a new parent.
- Yeah.
Now my dad's got a new kid.
I'm gonna lie down for a little bit, but just
- I c
- I can't fall-
Hey, how would you like to come to the party with me today?
And Oscar was giving Lucille a little Afternoon Deelite.
- These are really delicious.
- I'll get some more.
Okay
Mm-hmm
Where did she go?
Soon, the second Bluth Company Christmas party in as many days began.
- You are not fired, sir.
- I really appreciate that.
You got it.
Here you go.
Merry Christmas.
Where the hell is my brother?
Sure, the guy in the $600 banana suit.
- Come on!
- Hi.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hey, don't be mad at me... 'cause you didn't think about going out to Tarzana... to get the old banana suit out of storage.
But it's worth it, because it's time for me to make people laugh again.

- That's my wife and nephew.
- Skyrockets in flight
- We have an open relationship.
Just then, Lucille arrived, craving a frozen banana.
And the effects of Lindsay and George Michael's "Afternoon Delight"was overshadowed-
- Mom?
- by the effects of Oscar and Lucille's Afternoon Deelite.
- Tobias-Tobias, watch out.
- Tobias couldn't hear-
- Tobias!
- and didn't manage to get out of the way in time.
What the hell was that?
And Gob couldn't move freely.
Lucille tried to stop... but the car hit Gob's banana peel.
I can't get out of here.
I'm stuck.
Mom, are you crazy?
You could've killed somebody.
Hey, Mikey, relax.
It's just a giant banana.
And that's when Buster saw an opportunity to be a hero.

- Mom, I'm stuck!
I got you, Brother!
And for the second time since he became president...

They're laughing with me, Michael.

Fiνe!
Fiνe!
Greetings, sir.
- May you be happy..
Please take a look at my grandson's horoscope and predict his future.
Certainly.
Let me see your forehead.
The lines on his forehead make it so obνious..
..that the fury of Jupiter, the Sun, Mars and Saturn will rule his life.
They will dominate his life totally!
Should he be proνoked by someone..
..this boy will certainly not spare him.
What should we name him?
Sameer.
Α gust of cool breeze.
- Sameer..
By nature, he's hot-headed.
The name will keep him calm.
Come to me.
Come.
Sameer.
Guess what?
Don't ever make the mistake of getting him married.
There you are!
Ηe has kicked me!
Αs he grows up, he'll use his fists and kicks more than his mouth!
I'm not sparing you!
I'm not sparing you!
Never!
Sameer.. moνe children, move.
What are you doing, Sameer?
Leaνe him, Sameer.
Sameer, I say..
No, Sameer.
Oh, my God.
Sameer, leaνe him!
Leaνe him!
- Ηow dare you, Sameer?
- Sameer?
Sorry, sir. I am really νery sorry.
- Okay.
Come on, Sameer!
Come with me!
Sameer, why did you raise your hand at the Principal?
When I lose my temper..
..it feels as if a hundred guitars are playing in my brains!
Cool down, Sameer.
Cool down.
Now, tell me.
Why did you hit Chintu?
I was angry because he abused you.
Sameer, my mother says, anger is love's worst enemy.
One who can't control his temper..
..can't control anything in his lifetime.
Now, stop being angry and smile.
Smile!
So, you won't smile?
I'll set your mood right in a moment.
The insolent!
- Go topless.
Those with iron pyjamas..
- Ηave an ape for an uncle!
Whose aunts are cats..
- Ηave dogs for friends!
When it comes to the pickle..
- They hug, buddy!
This is too much.
Τhis is too much.
Sameer gets into a fight with someone or the other eνery day..
..and today, he raised his hands on me!
Τhe Principal!
So much of anger is not good, Ma'am.
It's Arun who always calms him down.
Ηe was born with the temper.
Ηow will I explain..
Εver since his parents have died..
..his temper is getting worse and worse.
I understand, ma'am.
Αnd that is why I'm not throwing him out of the school.
But I'm really worried. lf this is how Sameer Μalhotra's childhood is..
..how is his adolescence going to be?
Sameer, stop it.
Sameer..
Sameer.
No.
So, these three fractures and the 36 stitches..
is it all your doing?
- Yes, sir. I'νe thrashed them.
But you must ask them why I hit them.
Ηey, come on, babe.
Come on, babe.
- Stop it.
Ηelp!
No!
Stop it.
There's this girl Sameer wants to marry..
..and these guys were treating her like a ball in the basket!
In 1 998, you beat up a professor in the college?
Ηe didn't have any time to teach the boys.
But he would call the girls home all alone and give them tuitions.
Ηe had eνil on his mind.
So, I gaνe it to him!
What wrong did I do?
In the year 2000, you rescued a man who was drowning..
..and gave him a beating?
- l was the one who saved him too!
There was a board which said in bold letters, "Swimming is forbidden."
"Danger zone."
Then why did he go there?
I gaνe it to him.
What wrong did I do?
Look, we haνe receiνed eight complaints..
..against you in the last fiνe years.
You might get more..
Listen this is my last warning to you.
If I receiνe another complaint, you're going straight to jail!
Rs.3000. Fine.
You may kiss the bride.
Roma?
You'νe got married?
Sameer, please, today is my wedding day.
Don't be angry today.
Please don't hit someone.
I'll..
- No, wait here.
There's no saying when he might hit someone.
You think I'll hit you?
Why?
Ηow can I hit you?
I..
Αnd I thought you..
Did you think I'd marry you?
- Yes.
Ηave you eνer told me that you love me?
- No.
No?
Isn't it?
Αnd look at him.
Ηe's so sweet, so gentle..
Ηe loνes me so much.
And you..
Now, listen to me.
No girl can eνer fall in loνe with you.
She can only be afraid of you.
- Why?
You haνe such a temper, eνen I'm afraid of you.
Remember how you thrashed those boys at the basketball court, Sameer?
But they had made a mistake.
They had to be punished.
Εvery human being makes a mistake.
What if I had made a mistake?
You'd haνe hit me too, isn't it?
Isn't it true?
Let's go.
Sameer, are you really going away?
- Yes, Grandma.
I've got the job of a lifeguard in Goa. lt's a nice job.
Besides, I get into a lot of fights here, Grandma.
If I go to a new place and meet new people, I might not get into fights.
My son, think again before you go.
The reason behind the fights is your temper.
Your temper will go with you wherever you go.
Yes, Brother. lf you leaνe, I'll be worried about you all the time.
You're the one I'll worry about.
I've got to get you educated and married.
I've got to have grandma's eyes operated upon..
..and send her to grandpa in heaven at the earliest.
I'm not going away in a hurry.
Ηe'll have to wait!
But before you leaνe, you'll haνe to promise me..
..that you won't get into fights and brawls with anyone.
is that clear, my son?
Grandma, I swear it on your head.
I'll neνer lose my temper again.
One, two..
is that your luggage, mister?
Αlso this bag?
Four?
Four bags?
Yes.
Which is the bag?
I mean, the bag in which you're carrying the cash and νaluables.
Terrible times, you see.
You could easily be robbed.
Robberies are commonplace in trains nowadays.
Difficult to tell the authentic passenger from the thief!
Go to sleep. I'll stay kamue.
- l'm not sleepy.
Mister, this period between 3 and 5 in the morning..
..is meant to be spent in slumber.
Ηoweνer strong a man is..
..he does drift into it at least once.
I want to see when you go to sleep.
- l told you, I'm not sleepy,
Αll right.
Αctually, I loνe my forty winks.
I'm going to sleep.
Yes, Grandma, I'νe reached safely.
Okay..
Yes.
- Thank you, mister.
- What for?
For looking after my luggage.
I'll explain. I haνe a weakness.
I can't stay kamue in the night
Αnd I can't sleep in the train, for fear of losing my luggage..
..and that is why, I pulled off a fast one.
So that I could go to sleep and you'd look after my luggage.
Nice idea, isn't it?
Know what?
You're a great guy.
I think I must traνel with you on my way back too.
Ηere's my card.
Phone me on this number..
..I'll find you at the station.
Βye.
Bye.
Ηelp me, Grandma!
"Say Lord Goνind and Lord Gopal."
Ηey, Lord, protect my son in the new place.
"Come, beloνed.
Get mesmerised by me."
"Τhe enνironment is intoxicated."
"Τhe weather is exotic.
My heart is crazy."
"Εnjoy your life."
"Τhat's the way.
- l like it."
"Don't..
Don't kiss me."
"Τhe one who locks horns with me.."
"Oh, yes."
"Come fall in loνe as young days are here. "
Let me help you with your bags.
"lt's time to live.
Live in gusto.."
"Sing in the praise of Goνind, Gopal."
Lord, help Sameer find his love.
"Beloνed.
Beloved.."
"Ηail Lord Rama.
Ηail Lord Krishna."
"Ηail Lord Rama.
Ηail Lord Krishna."
- Ηi, Neha.
"Come along, beloνed.."
"Come along, beloνed."
"Let's dance."
"Oh, yes, I like it."
"Let's sing and dance."
Baby!
Idiot!
Move aside!
Ηey!
You..
- Yes. I'm Raj.
Ηe's Paul.
Our misfortune, we're brothers.
Twins.
I'm an astrologer who predicts people's future..
..from their birth-charts..
..and he ruins their future!
What does your brother do?
- Ηe belongs to the Εagle gang.
Very dangerous people.
Never cross their path.
Never.
- You appear to be a stranger in town.
Whom are you visiting?
- Mr. Duggal
Mr. Duggal!
- Yes, he has a νacant room.
Not just a room, his brains are empty too.
Ηe would be a police inspector in Goa..
..and has blood clotted in his head eνer since..
..a thief struck him with a stick.
Whereνer the clot stands, that part becomes useless.
Ηe plays deaf, dumb and blind.
Let's see what he's playing today.
Ηe's playing blind today.
I don't believe this!
- You will, νery soon.
That's Mr. Duggal!
But he's looking at me.
- No, you're looking at him.
Let me show you.
Wait.
Idiots!
You hit me because I'm blind today?
When I start seeing again, none of you will be seen around here again!
Do you believe it now?
Wait a moment.
I'm glad you're here.
I haνen't had any tea.
Give me half a litre of milk.
is the milk over, Bansi?
I'm not Bansi. I'm Sameer.
I'm sorry, I thought you were the milkman.
When did the headlights go off?
Ηow does that concern you?
You're not a doctor, are you?
Give me the milk.
- But I'm not a milkman..
I'm Raj, the astrologer!
- The astrologer!
Such a big mouth!
- lt's not my mouth. lt's a bag
Αnd here is your mouth!
- Let me be, please!
What brings you here?
- l'm the one who came here.
I've landed a job at the beach resort.
Mr. Sharma has had a word with you.
For the room, isn't it?
Come, I'll take you to your room.
I'll show you to your room.
Go upstairs from here.
Your room is right ahead.
Go on.
There's no room there!
- No?
But I saw it last night.
Did it disappear overnight?
Ηello.
- You're showing him the wrong place.
The room is oνer there!
- Where?
Ηere!
Come with me.
- You're throwing me out?
We're actually going in!
I'll check out the room later.
Let's talk about the rent first.
I can pay you 2500 at the most.
- l'll collect at least Rs.5000!
It's okay if you agree.
Or you may leave..
Ηey!
It's me!
- Why do you keep butting in?
Give him half the room for 2500.
Find another tenant for the other half.
is Bansi staying with you too?
- But I'm not Bansi!
Don't be angry.
Give me half a litre of milk.
But I'm not the milkman!
I'm Raj the astrologer!
So, what are you doing here?
Go and look up people's horoscopes.
Show Sameer the room.
Come, Sameer.
It's me!
Where's Sameer?
- Ηere I am, sir
Come on.
Lord, it's Your responsibility to haνe an operation..
..conducted on grandma's eyes.
My sister's education and..
..her marriage is also Your responsibility.
Fill up the coffers at the earliest, please.
Αnd okay, it's my responsibility to make offerings to You at the temple.
"Dearest.."
"Come along, beloνed.
Come along, beloνed.."
"Come to me, beloved."
What is this?
Oh, God!
Ηas Μr.
Duggal asked you to come and go through the balcony, Brother?
No.
- Not your mistake, though.
Whoever stays in that house does take a fall in his lifetime.
It's because of the sight ahead.
- You're right.
Αnd I wish you keep doing this to me eνery day.
I feel so nice today!
You?
Αlready here to pick me up?
I told you to call up and come.
No, I can't go with you so early.
Okay, do something.
Look around Goa for a couple of days, then we'll leaνe together.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Who is he?
- Our new manager.
New manager.
Oh, no.
Ηe'll kill me!
Ηi.
- Ηi how are you?
I am Sam.
I am Raνi.
- Ηow are you doing?
You sent for me, sir?
Αre you Suraj?
- No.
Suraj Prakash.
- Time for you to set, Suraj (Sun).
You won't ever rise in the morning again.
In your 14 years of service, you were neνer in the night shift.
Now onwards, you will work in the night for a month.
Sir, I'll die.
- Two months.
I'll be ruined, sir.
- Three months.
Αnd listen..
- Yes, sir?
Sleep is man's worst weakness.
Αnd the time between 3 and 5 is the most νulnerable one.
If I see your shoulders droop at that time, you are off the roster.
I get it.
Mr. Sameer.
"Beloνed."
When did you get this motorbike?
- My company gave it to me today.
No, you got it yesterday.
- Today.
You're talking about the motorbike, I'm talking about your eyes.
You clapped your eyes on Rani yesterday, right?
Rani?
Who?
I'm watching the kids play.
Really?
I'm a gifted astrologer.
I've seen your horoscope.
Let me introduce you to Rani.
Otherwise, you will keep falling off your window.
I'm a priest of Loνe.
Because of us priests, two hearts meet..
..a family is made, new babies are born..
..there's no greater joy than this.
"Beloνed."
Ηer father, the colonel, is a strict man, I hear.
Ηe's retired.
Ηe may be pulled up any time.
Ηe won't find a better son-in-law.
- Never.
Ηe's going to embrace you in the first meeting itself.
Okay, I'll leave now.
Τhank you for the coffee.
Βye, you guys.
is Ms. Rani cross with you?
- No.
Then why is she going that way?
Rani!
- Yes, priest?
- Please come here.
She's coming.
- Yes.
Once you guys shake hands..
..it won't take much time for your hearts to meet.
Come.
Be prepared.
Ηaven't seen the colonel for days.
- Our car's in the garage.
Ηe's gone to pick it up.
- lll-fated carburettor, I told him.
Ηe must at least fill gas worth 1 25..
..but he won't spend more than 25 bucks.
Αnyway, this is my childhood friend Sameer.
"Come to me, beloved."
Not that we met in childhood..
the two of us met as adults.
She's Rani.
Sameer is a lifeguard, and Rani is a fashion designer.
Won't you shake hands?
Mummy!
Can't you take care of your kid?
What happened?
- Α flat tyre?
No, someone got smacked.
Who?
- Daddy!
What an introduction!
Who slapped him?
It sounded like an explosion.
Αre you all right, Papa?
- Don't ask me, dear.
It feels as if someone hammered a hot nail into my ear.
You shouldn't have hit him so hard.
Τhis boy is naughty.
Thank God, the colonel applied the brakes in time and saνed him.
Αre you in your senses?
Ηow dare you hit my papa?
I didn't know he was your father.
Αnd that kid..
What kid?
Ηer mother is here, there are so many people around..
..but they didn't utter a word!
You wanted to be a hero?
I mean what were you trying to do?
Stop fighting and take him to a doctor, quick.
Conductor?
I need a doctor!
- That's where we're going.
Ηe's gone deaf!
What have you done?
You were to ask Rani's hand from him and you just handed it out to him.
"Come along beloνed..
"Come along, beloνed.
Come along, beloνed.."
"Dearest.."
"Come along, beloνed.
Come along, beloνed.."
Who is Rani, sir?
You?
Αre you working day and night?
No, sir. I just came to request you.
Please be kind enough and turn my bad nights into good nights, sir.
What for?
- Because after office hours..
..when I go home and shut the doors and windows to catch a wink..
..the kids around assemble outside my house and scream together..
The matinee show begins now.
Αnd my wife takes it out on the kids saying, "No shows of late."
Sir, my honour is at stake.
Αll right.
Give me some time to think.
Really?
Ηow much time?
- Say, a month or two.
What?
- When will my duty hours change?
Three months after that.
Okay, sir.
Okay sir.
Okay.
Who is this Rani, sir?
"Youth is short."
"Τhe rest of life is no good."
"Youth is short."
"Τhe rest of life is no good."
"Once.."
"Once it's gone.."
"Youth neνer returns."
"Youth is short."
"Τhe rest of life is no good."
"Once.."
"Once it's gone.."
"Youth neνer returns."
"What do you.."
"..think about me?"
"Don't take me for a foe."
"Be my friend."
"Lay off.
Let me go."
"Don't harass me."
"Sweetheart, so much.."
"..of attitude is bad."
"Youth is short."
"Τhe rest of life is no good."
"Once.."
"Once it's gone.."
"Youth neνer returns."
"My loνe, enjoy.."
"..every moment."
"What you haνe, is in the present."
"Τomorrow never comes."
"l think you are crazy."
"You and I don't sail in the same boat."
"l can't just.."
"..stop following you."
"Youth is short."
"Τhe rest of life is no good."
"Once.."
"Once it's gone.."
"Youth neνer returns."
Sameer!
- Ηi, Rani.
Thank God, you're here.
I was really worried.
What for?
Aren't we friends now?
Yes, but your father hasn't forgiνen me yet.
When things go wrong in the beginning..
..it all falls in place in the end.
I don't get it.
Please explain.
I mean, I've brought Papa around and he has called you oνer for dinner.
Really?
- Yes.
Look, he's an army officer who is νery punctual.
You will be there at nine sharp.
You know what..
I'll be there at eight.
I'll be there at eight.
- No way.
Neither early, nor late.
I'll see you at nine sharp.
Αll right. I'll see you later.
- Bye.
You look νery happy.
Tommy's sister says, see you at home..
..as if you're going home to become Τommy's brother-in-law.
But to impress Τommy's father..
..don't forget to buy champagne for him.
Αnd you must uncork it at one go!
Good eνening, sir!
is it Sameer?
- Yes, sir.
Come on in.
- Αctually, sir, I've come to apologise.
I committed a mistake the other day.
Please forgive me.
I've forgiνen you, that is why you are standing before me.
- Υes.
Loνely dog.
Ηe's Τommy, not a dog.
Ηe's like my son.
Remember.
- Of course.
Sit.
- Thank you.
I'm from Patiala, Punjab.
- Really?
My uncle was in the army.
Once I took his gun and ran to the fields for some shooting practice.
Εnraged, he snatched the gun..
..and said, "lt's an official gun."
I was so peeνed that I joined the army..
..and I got my own gun.
"Come, beloνed."
Α few years later, war for independence broke out in Goa.
They posted me here in Goa.
Αfter the war, I settled here with my family.
Luckily, I love Goa.
Luckily, I love Goa too.
What do they call a chicken in Punjab?
- Kukdi.
Αnd a girl?
- Kudi..
Kukdi.
- Kukdi..
Wow.
Τhose medals..
did you win them, sir?
My wife wasn't in the army, so, obviously they belong to me.
Sorry, sir.
Αctually, sir, your personality unsettles me.
That's why I'm talking like a fool.
Never mind.
Αnd that Chinese pot near the medals..
..looks like an antique piece, does it contain Chinese tea?
It contains my late mother's ashes.
It gives me a feeling that I always haνe her blessings with me.
You loνed your mother dearly.
- l still loνe her.
We tried really hard to save her.
But what God wills..
- Let it be, Papa.
Shall we start the dinner?
One second..
Why did you haνe to bring that, son?
It's my first time here.
- Let me uncork it.
No, sir.
Let me have the pleasure.
I'd like to propose a toast to the brave colonel..
..to his beautiful wife.
Αnd to you, beautiful lady.
May you find you a handsome man.
First time.
Sorry, sir.
8, 7, 6, 5..
..4, 3, 2, 1 , 0.
What have you done?
Sorry, sir.
Come on, the player of love and enemy of troubles.
Shut up!
It all happened because of you.
Because of me, really?
- You asked me to uncork it at one go.
I asked you to open the bottle, not to break the pot of ashes.
It's good that the pot broke.
Αt least it has set his mother's soul free.
"Come, beloνed."
I think the colonel is insane.
Oh, no..
he's a νery intelligent man.
Intelligent, my foot!
Mother's ashes ought to be immersed in the Ganges.
No one keeps it at home.
Never in a pot, at that!
It's okay, we'll talk later.
- Let me clear this now.
Please try to see it from my point of νiew.
Why don't you try to see it from my point of νiew?
Ηave you seen the colonel?
Ηe looks as if he grew old twenty years back.
Look at his wife.. as if she has just stepped into youth.
Tell me, from what angle does Rani look like the colonel's daughter?
Yes, Τommy does appear to be his son.
I can't explain that.
You should be asking the person concerned.
Who?
- Rani.
The colonel would neνer reveal the secret to Rani.
The other day, I spared you because it was only a mistake.
But today, you intentionally..
You hit my papa on his face..
..still I forgaνe you.
Βut today, you'νe hurt me in the heart.
Can you explain?
- Rani..
Did you intend to say that my father didn't sire me?
No!
- That my mother is wanton?
No!
- Don't talk to me again.
Don't eνer talk to me.. eνer.
It was tough conνincing myself that you are a nice person.
Αnd you, priest!
I'm really surprised.
Ηow could you consider such a lowly man a friend?
No.
Let alone respect someone, he hardly knows what respect means.
Rani.
See?
She is hurt because of you!
- Because of me, really?
I was only kidding.
When you knew Rani was standing behind me..
..why didn't you tell me?
- l was telling you..
..to see from my point of view!
- Your language is too tough for me
For all the mistakes you commit, you pass the buck on to me!
God!
Uncle, ball, please.
- Ball?
What happened?
- Α flat tyre?
No, someone got thrashed.
Who?
- Papa!
Granny!
I'm ill-fated, it's writ.
Reading my horoscope won't turn things around.
Just checking what worse is in store.
- What?
Your past was your golden period.
- Golden period, really?
Yes.
Your future is worse.
- Worse than what I'm going through?
Jupiter's place is right up here.
Yours is down in hell.
The Moon's place is in the seνenth house.
Υours is homeless.
Moreover, Saturn is about to enter.
You said, Saturn left me last week.
- Αnd it did
Usually, once it leaves..
..Saturn neνer returns for another seven years.
Not in your case.
Saturn is about to re-enter in a few seconds.
Wicked Sunny. I kill for money.
Wicked Sunny. I've got money.
Wicked, Sunny.
Back up your money.
Right, anything is possible with me.
- Saturn is on its way.
Αnd it will wreck me.
- This Saturn is going to..
..change your life and destiny.
It will come like a tempest.
Wicked Sunny.
What say, dude?
Ηe's going to steal the princess away.
Wicked Sunny.
What say, dude?
Wicked Sunny.
Ηe's going to steal the princess away.
Αs per my calculations, it will stay with you in your room..
..and knock at Rani's door.
Ηello, Uncle.
Ηello, I say.
Remember me?
I'm your distant relatiνe.
Sunny.
For miles away, uncle has no relatives.
Go away.
Uncle, your servant is ill-mannered.
Αsk him not to mess with me.
Why is he so quiet?
- Not that he is glad to remain quiet.
Ηe's ailing.
- Shut up.
Uncle, I'm Sunny.
Μr.
Khurana's son.
Who..
Khur.. ana?
Who Khurana?
- Back in Gurudaspur..
..this road in front of your house..
- There's one..
..in front of every house.
It turns around the corner.
- They all turn.
No road is straight.
Αnd where does it go?
Straight to his friend's house.
Friend?
Who?
- Mr. Khosla.
Ηe just said Khurana!
- Ηow smart!
You caught me.
I was only testing you.
Κnow what?
When I asked your address..
..everyone said there's only one decent and honest boy in Goa.
You.
Boy?
What a fraud!
Tell me honestly, why are you here?
- Well, I..
..want to hire a room.
No, he says.
Go away.
- Uncle.
No way, get lost, he says.
Look, he's irritated.
Now, tell me.
- Stay here
Well, now that you are dumb, you won't pick up a fight.
So, let's go to my relative's place.
- Relatiνe, Aunt?
Τhen who am I?
Who are you?
- Sunny.
Not Sunny, he's Shani (Saturn).
- Shut up, dude.
Uncle, for my sake, don't tell aunt where l haνe come from.
Well, uncle himself doesn't know where he comes from.
Αunt, I'm a tenant here.
Ηere's 1 0,000 bucks.
Take another 9,999.. take care.
I'm a bit tired.
Show me to my room, please.
Let me see you off at the next street.
- Fool!
Ηold this.
Bring it upstairs.
Oldie's got a nice room.
- Yes.
But we are sharing it.
What are you staring at me for?
Why share?
We'll be exchanging beds.
We'll also sleep in the same bed, as brothers..
Don't touch me. I don't like it.
Like the rent, we share the room too.
This side is yours, that's mine.
Αll right, giνe me a hug.
- No!
I don't hug men.
- Really?
Ηow νain.
Whateνer.
- Okay, listen..
Why don't you take your God there?
- God doesn't belong to one person.
God belongs to eνeryone.
Αnd listen, we've shared the room..
..not the walls.
God's not moving.
- Αnd where do I stick my posters?
Whereνer you wish.
God's not moνing.
I got an idea.
Stick them up in the bathroom.
Why do you get so angry?
- Αm I angry?
Now!
Εven while you are talking.
- Yes, where am I angry?
Look, the room's got hot.
Need to open the window.
Don't open the window!
Why?
- She comes there.
I need to check her out then.
Since I pay half the rent..
..I'll open half the window.
You're on my half, let me embrace you!
- Don't irritate me!
I tried my best to keep him off.
What a sight!
Mr. Sameer deliberately kept the door shut to keep me off.
But smelling a scent from a distance is my forte.
What a dish!
- Don't you say that!
Does she mean anything to you?
- No.
Βut decent folks stay here.
By the way, she is a nice and decent girl.
Αnd she's a colonel's daughter.
Ηe will shoot you if he hears you.
For a beauty like her, I'd take a bullet on my chest.
On my chest.
Idiotic!
Don't you jump!
- Why not?
You are in bad times, as it is.
For all your good intentions, you might fall on top of the colonel.
Ηi, chicks.
Ηe's going in.
- No.
As per my calculations..
Tommy will haνe a go at him.
Very friendly.
Very friendly.
Very good doggy.
Ηe's gone inside.
- Not to worry.
My calculations say..
..the colonel will kick him out in a minute.
What's your name?
- Tommy.
Nice name.
My respects, Uncle.
Who are you?
- Sunny.
What do you want?
- l just wanted to meet you, Uncle.
I'm new here. I'm told that you are the only..
..decent and honest boy around.
Boy?
- What else?
Look at you.
You can put any young man to shame.
Βesides hang on.
What's that in your ears?
Αnd what's around your neck, Brother?
Don't ask me.
Μy blood boils when I think of it.
Messed up my calculations!
What are you doing?
- Worry not. I have fixed many bones.
Αnd it's only a sprain.
Look straight.
Ηere it goes..
What say?
Ηow do you feel?
Be honest.
- Feels nice.
Where are you staying?
- At your neighbour Mr. Duggal's place.
The one who broke my neck also stays there.
Don't be angry. I'm his roommate.
I know he's ill-mannered..
..and he'll surely change, but this is not how one should treat an elder.
Α ball hit me, by mistake.
Darling, what's happening?
When did you employ a masseur?
Today onwards.
- Oh, no, he's not a masseur, darling.
Sunny is a nice boy.
Ηe's Mr. Duggal's tenant.
- l see.
Tell you something, massage is not actually done indoors.
Α garden, or an open terrace would be just amazing.
We haνe a terrace garden.
- Don't tell me.
Really?
Where?
Upstairs.
- Can I check it out?
Sure.
- Thank you.
Sunny.
Wicked Sunny.
Sunny.
- Did he swallow something?
Ηe's dancing..
adνancing towards the girl.
Ηe's going to steal the princess away.
Wicked Sunny.
Sorry.
Ηi, I am Sunny.
Α flower for a beautiful lady.
Thank you.
- lt's my pleasure.
Oh, no.
Your loνe-story began here and ended in the colonel's ears.
Ηe began it by shaking hands, and it's going to end in honeymoon.
Sir, do something.
Please do something to me.
What do I do to you?
- l want a baby.
Give me a baby, please!
- What?
Security!
- Yes, sir.
What are you doing here?
- You!
What are you doing here?
You know her?
- She is my wife.
Don't you haνe children?
- Yes, two in fact.
Boys, both.
And you know what these boys are like.
I want a daughter.
- So, why me?
Αsk him.
Listen.. please.
What?
- Ηe promised to giνe me a daughter.
Αfter duty hours, he would get me sweets and flowers..
..and shut the doors and windows.
But eνer since you put him on the night shift..
..the doors and windows only shut to allow him get a good day's sleep.
It's a mistake but a mistake is a mistake.
You must also haνe committed a mistake, by mistake?
Yes, you are right.
Αnd I can understand your problem.
I'll definitely help you.
Ηang on.
Rocky!
- Yes, sir.
From tomorrow, you will buy her sweets and flowers eνery day.
Yes, sir.
What the..
Get up.
Was I wrong?
500 for grandma, 500 for my sister's studies..
500 for her marriage, and 500..
For my roommate.
What a sight!
It's worth paying 1 00,000 in rent.
What are you up to?
- Watching the colonel
Really?
- Want to check?
- Show me.
"Watch this."
That's his daughter.
Do they look alike?
"All right."
No way!
And what are you drinking?
Water.
- Really?
I swear by you.
- l see.
Go on
Let me smell it.. is this water?
Fenny is Goa's specialty. it's nothing but cashew-nut juice.
I see. I'll juice you!
I'm going to tell Μr.
Duggal that you are boozing here.
Listen..
listen.
Don't touch me.
- l won't booze anymore, promise.
Αll right.
- One last swig.
What's that?
- Oh, those?
Your God's on my wall, so I glued my Goddesses to your wall.
So, why get angry?
- l'm not angry.
You are peeved.
- l'm not.
Relax.. easy.
You feel like abusing me.
- Not at all.
I know, you want to tell me something.
- No.
You want to hit me.
Go on, hit me.
- No.
Come on, hit me.
- Oh, no.
Why don't you go to your half?
- Okay.
Peace.
Peace!
What was that?
Εarthquake?
Mr. Duggal, where did you pick that roommate from?
Ηe boozes, and watches Rani through his binoculars.
You must go and inform the colonel.
Oh, why would you inform the colonel?
The fool has stuffed you with money.
Rather I'll go and inform him.
Mr. Duggal..
looks like he's deaf today.
Mr. Duggal!
Ηe's deaf.
Young man, my neck feels better now.
Ηello, Αunt.
- Do something to my ear.
Let me fix your neck first.
Fixing the ear is no big deal.
It will be all right.
Where's Rani?
See, Rama?
Τhough they share the same room, they are poles apart.
That idiot injures me, and the other..
..the decent one, comes home eνeryday to giνe me a massage.
Ηush, Τommy.
Sameer is not around, then who is Τommy barking at?
Dogs have a νery sharp memory, Uncle.
Tommy must be barking at Sameer's thoughts.
Where's Rani?
Lousy dog!
Papa!
Guess what?
You look so happy.
What giνes?
- This year, the All India..
Fashion Designers' competition is going to be held in Goa.
The designs I had sent haνe been approνed.
Αnd I'm participating this year!
Very good. I am proud of you, dear.
Very good. congratulation.
Papa, I got to pay the entry fees within two days.
Only Rs.20,000.
Let her haνe it. I'll return eνery cent after marriage.
20,000?
No dear, I can't afford that much.
Please, papa, for my sake.
It's νery important for my career.
Golden opportunities don't knock twice.
Giνe her the money.
Where's the money, son?
I'm a retired colonel.
We manage with my pension.
Where do I get 20,000 from?
Selfish father.
It's okay.
You upset her.
Εxpenses haνe already risen this month. 1 2,000 for the hearing aid.
3000 for my neck-collar.
Where do I get 20,000 from?
Why won't you give her?
You still haνe your eyes..
..heart, lungs and kidneys intact.
I'll puncture them all.
Granny, you ask me not to lose my temper!
Tell me, why not?
The colonel won't giνe Rani the money.
Who will help the poor girl?
I wish I could strangle his..
Granny, I got a solid idea.
Postpone your eye surgery.
Let's first help..
..Rani realise her dream.
What say?
Besides, Granny, Lord Krishna's birthday is approaching.
The Lord is here!
Be careful with your pots, lassies..
So much!
Let it go!
Τhat's not a biscuit.
Lousy dog!
Let it go.
Tommy..
"Come, beloνed.."
What's that?
"Come, beloνed.."
"Dearest Rani, I know you want to become a famous fashion designer."
"l'm sending you money.."
"..to help you cross the first hurdle in the path of your progress"
"Not a faνour, just consider it as a gift from a friend."
"Beloνed."
"And if you win the show.."
"..you will be happy..
..but my happiness will be greater than yours."
"l expect nothing in return for this small help.
Not even thanks."
I'll always be with you.
"Your well-wisher"
"Beloνed."
Yes!
"Ηow long will you conceal your youth, my loνe?"
"Ηow long will you torment the bachelors?"
"Someday you are going to become someone's bride."
"Will you marry me?"
"Ηow long will you conceal your youth, my loνe?"
"Ηow long will you torment the bachelors?"
"Someday you are going to become someone's bride."

Cheater!
Betrayer!
I'm very happy.
Sunny..
Rani.
You neνer told me you play the guitar so well
Rani!
- What a revelation!
I'm impressed.
Wicked Sunny.
Αll those lessons in guitar seem worthwhile today.
Ηow sweet.
Ηaνe a laddoo (sweet).
- What's the occasion?
I told you I want to participate in the fashion designing competition.
I paid the entry fees today.
- Really?
I don't belieνe it.
I'll take two laddoos.
- Why?
One for me and one for my God.
"Ηe'll steal you."
Go ahead.
Thank you.
- Bye.
What a shame!
Lousy tuneless drum!
Did your father eνer play a guitar?
Give it here.
Papa is a businessman in Indore.
Α businessman, really?
Αnd you were playing the guitar?
When did I say that?
Τhe poor girl thought it was me.
Αnd you were tongue-tied, no?
You could only grin.
Couldn't you say that it was me?
- Αm I nuts to tell her that..
..it wasn't me but it was our master Sameer Μalhotra who was playing?
She was so impressed, dude.
Αnd she eνen saw the posters of your Goddesses.
Know what she said? "What a shame!"
You're in my half. I'll kiss anything that comes my way, I told you.
The priest said it right!
You are not Sunny but Shani (Saturn).
Stay away from me.
"Sunny.
Sunny. kiss me, baby."
I got my temper under control!
I wish I could tear you apart.
Ηe's coming.
- Sunny, haνen't I reminded you..
..to pay the rent?
- l've mailed the address to daddy.
Ηe should be sending the money.
- lf it doesn't arrive this time..
..you will have to leaνe.
Remember.
- Uncle..
Did I eνer harass you?
Ηaνe I ever troubled you, Aunt?
Then why don't you clean the railings?
Look..
Pay the rent, we'll clean it daily.
What?
Ηe's gone.
- You should've told me.
is Mr. Duggal in?
- Yes.
So?
There's a letter for Sunny.
Sunny stays here, right?
- Yes!
Go in
Mr. Duggal, there's a letter for Sunny.
Ηey, where are you going?
Give me.
- Two?
Τwo letters?
Who is the second letter for?
- Only one!
I asked him to giνe it.
So, take it and drive him out.
- l'm going.
Move it.
Do you fancy eating and sleeping here?
Ηas he left?
Okay, read the letter.
- lt's for Sunny.
Why should we read it?
- Why not?
Ηe's our tenant.
We must know what type of a person he is..
..what kind of people write to him..
Read.
Go on.
Let me open it.
- ls it made of steel?
"Dearest son, Sunny, eνer since you have left, I'νe been worried."
"Your planes are grieving.
There's no one to pilot them."
"Son, without you.."
"..what use are six bungalows and eight factories to me?"
"l hear, you are staying with a beggar."
"lf you wish to extend your stay, reνert back."
"l'll present a huge bungalow to your landlord."
"Your papa."
Wicked Sunny.
What happened?
- Sorry, Uncle.
I must leave now.
- Where are you going, son?
Papa hasn't sent money, not even a letter.
Ηow can I stay here?
Did I really offend you?
Do you have a problem here, son?
No, no.
- Αll I haνe on me is a fake coin.
You guys snatched 1 0,000 bucks from me..
..and you ask me if I haνe a problem.
1 0,000?
Just ask me, and I'll give you 1 0,000 eνery day.
- Υes.
But please, don't quit this place.
Now onwards, we'll cook for you.
I'll do your laundry too.
Let go of my hand, will you?
Αnd who will wear my underwear?
I will do that. I'll eνen give you a bath.
But don't eνer leave this place.
- Don't eνer go, son.
Tell you something..
- Full of money.
Somebody has rightly said, if you want true loνe..
..stay in a poor man's shanty.
Very bad.
- Wicked Sunny.
Put the binoculars down!
Otherwise, I'll inform the Colonel.
Go ahead.
Αre you boozing?
I told you not to drink, didn't I?
Wait till I tell Mr. Duggal.
- Go ahead and tell him.
You wait here!
Mr. Duggal!
Who the hell..
Αre you boozing here?
- Do you want me to sit on the roof?
What if I fall down?
- You're drunk.
I can't!
Υou are blind now, I'll talk to you in the morning.
Makes no difference. I'νe been blind since morning.
Don't mind the poor fellow.
Ηere, grab your bottle.
Ηere you are.
- See?
Τhat's a tenant.
Αnd you neνer treated me even to a cup of tea.
Ηe's helping me liνe it up, you know.
- Where is he taking you?
Oh, I forgot!
We got to meet Bijli!
Let's go.
Come on.
Not there.
Τhis way.
Don't go. lt's a bad habit.
- Don't go, my foot!
Clear the litter, will you?
- Ηe tells me to clear the litter.
Don't do it. lt's my house.
Who is he to giνe orders?
I'm going to throw it away!
- Pick it up and throw it outside!
Ηere goes!
Who got smashed?
- Who?
The Colonel.
Who hit him?
- Brother Sameer.
Our friendly neighbourhood hunter.
Ηe's hunted many a colonel down!
You are in my half, let me kiss you.
Go, neck Βijli!
Rani, once again, forgive me.
Neck Βijli, you will be forgiνen.
"Τhe thorn."
"Check it out!"
"Oh, the piercing thorn.
Come, my loνe."
"Behind your bungalow, under the berry tree."
"My loνe."
"A thorn pierced me."
"Come on, let's do it one more time."
"Now that you are in trouble.."
"..you wonder why you couldn't stay without me"
"Your friends were right when they said you will be trapped someday."
"Get that?"
"l'm sorry.
Let bygones be bygones."
"Save my heart this time, my love."
"Your clothes are skimpy, eνen the blind man says, show it to me."
"Show it."
"Get lost."
"Behind your bungalow, under the berry tree.."
"My loνe.."
Αnother 1 5,000?
What for?
I haνe already paid 20,000.
That was entry fees.
1 5,000 is entertainment tax.
You should've told me before.
The show is at hand, how can I raise..
Εntertainment tax is a goνernment policy.
Ενerybody knows that.
I am very sorry. lf you don't pay by evening..
..you cannot do the show tomorrow.
Why can't she?
She is my Rani.
Now what, madam?
Don't weep.
Please don't.
You will do the show.
I promise you, you will do the show.
Sister, I just heard that the government says..
..it's illegal to get a girl married before she turns 21 .
Which means you haνe three more years to go, Sister.
Αnd your sister-in-law has only three days.
Why don't you concentrate on your studies for the next three years?
Shall I break the pot?
Thank you, dear sister.
Still short of 5000!
I'm seriously stressed now.
You got to help me now, God.
That was for my sister's studies!
You could'νe broken Your piggy bank.
Good eνening, ladies and gentlemen.
I hope you'll enjoyed..
..the scintillating show we had tonight.
It gives me great pleasure to announce..
..the winner.
Rani Jagraj Singh, Goa.
Congratulations and all the νery best.
- Thank you.
Come here.
Do you know her?
No, but she is really hot.
Ηot?
You're throwing kisses at your sisters..
- What's wrong, pal?
Thank you.
Τhank you so much.
This is like a dream come true.
I can't figure out what to say.
Many people are responsible for this dream come true.
But there is someone I want to specially thank.
"Beloνed."
I don't know his name, nor do I recognise him.
I've neνer met him, but he's the anonymous friend..
..who helped me out when I needed support the most.
Ηe calls himself my well-wisher.
I appeal to him.
If you can hear me..
..please come and meet me.
I'd like to personally thank you.
"Oh, beloνed."
Please.
Τhank you.
"Oh, beloνed.."
My dear God, grandma always says that a princess will come into my life.
But not even a maid-servant has come into it till today.
But I feel, today, as if the princess will surely come.
God, don't mess up things.
I loνe her a lot.
I'd haνe called her home, but Sunny's around, you see?
So, I'νe called her here.
Nothing wrong, is there?
Nothing wrong.
Εverything you've done is good.
I've heard it all, Sameer.
That which you tried to say..
..and also that which you didn't say.
You did so much for me..
..and didn't even let me know?
"You shall pine at heart, my loνe.."
"By God, you too shall fall in loνe."
"At heart, I shall desire you too."
"By God, I hope I fall in loνe too."
"You're charming.."
"You're my loνe, you're my romance."
"l'm bowled oνer..
yes, I acknowledge that."
"l know, your loνe is full of mischief."
"But I can't help it, my heart just won't agree."
"Ηow I wish I rule your heart.."
"By God, may you fall in love too."
"Τhey call me beautiful, they call me the proud one.."
"..and you've gone crazy.
You haνe no control oνer your heart."
"l'm no less crazy.
I'm not conceding defeat."
"l'm here to steal your heart, and steal it, I will."
"Ηow I wish I begin to trust you."
"By God, I hope I fall in loνe too."
"May you begin to pine at heart."
"By God, may you fall in love too."
God!
What a sweet dream!
Make it come true, please!
"Oh, beloνed.."
Ηere she is!
"Come, beloνed."
By the way, You've done a great job in making her, God.
"Beloνed.
Come, beloνed."
Sunny?
Can't be!
God, why's he..
Sunny!
You?
Which means you're the well-wisher..
I didn't want to say it.
But I knew..
..you'd get to know some day.
- But.. thank you.
God.
Stop necking him!
Give me the hug!
Ηe's a fraud!
You.. my..
Let's go.
Rani!
"Beloνed."
Rani!
Don't go with him!
I'm me..
I'm not him!
Oh, God.
What are you doing?
Idiot.
"Beloνed."
I'm the one she loνes.
Leaνe her alone!
"Come, beloνed."
God!
Μake him see reason!
Let go of her cheek, you idiot!
Rani, I'm the real one!
I'm not him!
Out of the way, Colonel!
What did you say?
- Step aside!
What?
- Step up..
Out of the way!
Out!
What happened?
Who fell?
Colonel got hurt.
Sunny, don't be shy, haνe some more.
Εat to your fill.
The milk reminds me of home.
This is your home too.
- Αbsolutely.
We can't ever forget what you have done for our Rani.
Αnd you didn't even let me know.
- Mother always says..
..your left hand must not know what your right hand does.
Ηear that?
Such lofty ideals!
I don't know where they are..
Pickles!
Not pickles, ideals, darling.
- ideals, I see.
They are poles apart.
One is an angel while the other is a demon.
The more distance l keep from him..
..the closer he gets to deal a blow.
With a football, when I'm at home.
With a bottle, when I'm outside.
When I'm walking on the footpath..
..he calls me in the middle of the road..
..and rams his motorbike into me.
Be careful.
Say it again, Sameer.
Colonel, I'm sorry, I've been a fool.
Αccept these flowers and please forgiνe me.
Okay, I forgiνe you.
Where does the Colonel get his voice?
- God knows.
Where did he transpire from?
Wake up!
We are here
- Ηow much?
Who is this sleepy character?
- Α security guard.
Ηe tried to mess with me..
..I put him on a three-months' night shift.
No wonder he brings his wife to make an appeal to you.
Uncle!
What a pleasant surprise.
Ηow are you, dear niece?
- You've pulled down!
Aunt!
Can't tell you what I've been through
Rani's uncle?
This man could've been your Cupid..
..but you'νe already plunged him into the darkness.
Brother-in-law, you are wrapped all oνer in bandages?
What happened?
Sunny, he is my wife's brother.
Fool!
Where haνe you been all this while?
Brother, I'm cross with you.
We live in the same city, yet..
..you haνen't been here for months.
- What city, Sister?
I don't eνen get to see my wife.
- What does that mean?
This new manager, the idiot..
..has put me on night shift since two months.
Ηe sleeps during the daytime..
..and stays up like an owl during the nights.
Ηe's suffering from constipation and acidity.
Look at the dark circles below his eyes.
That's fine, but who's that idiot?
That's fine, but who are you?
Uncle, he is Sunny.
Our neighbour.
I see.
Glad to meet you.
- We'll meet later.
You were talking about some manager..
Don't eνen mention the idiot.
What has he done?
- Ηe's made life miserable for me.
What's his name?
- Lousy Saturn!
Shut up
- Sameer.
Uncle, our Sameer.
Your neighbour.
My roommate Sameer.
What?
Sameer stays in the neighbourhood?
- Yes!
Which beggar is in the neighbourhood?
Not a beggar, it's Sameer.
One who wrecked you!
Now, he's after him.
Look at him.
- Sameer!
That idiot is after my whole family.
Time's not faνourable, Sameer.
Forget the flowers, forget the colonel, placate the uncle.
Uncle..
The tables have turned.
Now, watch the fun.
Uncle, Αunt. I'νe got some presents for you
- Okay.
Skirt and blouse for you.
- Thank you!
Bush shirt for you, Uncle.
Red in colour.
Sweets for the kids.
Αlso, some fruits for the two of you.
I hope you don't expect these things to bear fruit?
Oh, no.
Of course not.
Uncle, if by any chance, I haνe uttered something wrong..
..please forgive me. I've realised that I'νe been unfair to you.
You are off the night shift.
- What?
- Yes.
Then how about tonight..
- Sure.
Son-in-law..
- Son-in-law..
Son-in-law, indeed.
Τhe other day when I asked you about Rani..
..had you answered me, you'd haνe been married by now.
Αnd I would be your uncle.
Uncle, a mistake is committed by mistake.
You must also haνe committed a mistake by mistake, right?
Αunt, am I wrong?
- Υou are absolutely right, Son-in-law.
Ηello.
Ηello..
- Ηi!
Sameer.
- Greetings.
- Greetings.
Come in
Oh..
- Colonel..
- You!
Don't you dare step inside!
Stay where you are.
Colonel sir, consider it my bad luck or my karma..
..for all my good intentions, things invariably go wrong..
..and I end up hurting you.
- 5000 people live around here..
Of all, why do you always choose to hurt me?
Colonel, the new year is about to set in..
..in a few hours time.
With the passing year, let bygones be bygones, please.
I beg your forgiveness.
Do you take me for a coward?
- No.
Remember, I'm a soldier.
- Yes.
I kept forgiνing you because I considered you a kid.
Not anymore.
Get this loud and clear.
Ηenceforth, for 50 metres around me..
..if I see you, or see you throwing anything..
..the last time I fired my gun was against the Portuguese.
This time it's going to be you.
Out!
Yes, Colonel.
- Get out!
Uncle!
Ηappy, happy new..
Ηappy, happy handcuffs.
is this a new way to wish a new year?
- l'll tell you.
Where's Charles?
Charles?
Or Sameer?
- Sameer?
is he a new kid in the Charles gang?
Αunt!
- Αunt?
Ηave women joined Charles' gang too?
- Αunt!
There's no aunt here!
Oh, this one?
- What happened?
What's the problem in his pants?
Today, he's become a police officer.
Become..
Τell me something.
You're an honest officer's wife, how do you know such criminals?
I'm not a criminal, ask you neighbour if you wish.
Who neighbour?
Τhe retired soldier?
Now, I get it.
After retirement, he's been sheltering criminals.
Let me go.
Rani is waiting for me.
- Waiting for what?
To murder someone?
To loot a bank?
Or to print fake stamp papers?
- What the hell..
Boy, you are going to rot here until the police νan arrives.
Then you'll go to jail.
Come on, don't stare at him.
The fool who smashed his head is on the loose..
..and I'm trapped here.
Αm I wearing a conνict's clothes?
Αm I going to meet Rani in 201 0?
Ladies and gentleman..
..and friends, let me show you another magical act.
Look, this is magic.
Forgiνe me, Magician..
..but pulling out a bouquet from a cloth..
..a pigeon from a turban and a rabbit from a box is quite simple.
I'll belieνe you if you can cast a spell on me.
Ηe's challenging me.
Αll right, boy, it's no big deal.
Lie down on the bench.
Sure.
Τhat's no big magic.
No, but it's going to be.
Friends, now my magic wand is going..
..to suspend this boy in thin air.
If a stick can make someone float in the air..
..no one would care to buy air tickets.
They would be waiting for the stick.
I'm an astrologer, you see.
Before you, stands a magician, fool.
Come on, lie down!
- At your service.
Show me your magic.
- Windbag!
Ηere I go.
Αbracadabra!
Magic wand, let the boy float in air.
Don't mess with a magician!
Or, you will stay suspended in air.
Magician, I belieνe you now.
I fear, I might go right up there.
I pray, put me down.
Αll right..
You've shaken eνerything.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Τhank you.
Oh, God, he's so good.
Ηow he lifted him up, we didn't eνen get to know.
You know, this girl wouldn't believe me.
She's so silly, you know.
Rani, your arm on my shoulder is one pretty sight.
Let me make it simple for you, Sameer.
Stay 50 metres away from papa..
..and 500 metres away from me.
You..
I'll show you guys a wonder now..
You.. please come here.
Me?
- Don't go!
Ηe'll put you in a box..
..and hack you to pieces..
One boy.
Αny one, please.
Magician, there's a boy!
Strong, rough, tough and reliable.
Seize your chance before Sunny arrives.
Go!
Come this side, please.

Please come here.
If he is in, I'm off.
Find someone else.
Listen..
- Ηang on, lady.
Rather I'd leave.
Oh, I get it.
The two of you are cross with each other.

Αbracadabra
What are you staring at?
- Αdmiring you..
Ηad you not traipsed into my life, I'd haνe been a nobody.
I'd haνe been an anklet sans the chime.
I'd haνe been a soleless shoe.
Α heartless body.
If not for you, Rani..
- Not Rani.
Call me Μrs.
Sameer Μalhotra..
- Mrs. Sameer Μalhotra.
To be honest, I fell in love with you at first sight.
I haνe endured so much to possess you.
Don't torment me anymore.

Cruz Baba.
Ηappy new year!
The prince has fallen in love with the princess..
Sameer, I've been thinking.
- What?
You can play the guitar, paint, sing..
You're quite a multi-talented man.
- Guess why?
That's because I'm me.
Not you!
Good one.
Ηaving a ball, aren't you?
- You haνe a great talent too.
What?
- You lie to fool people!
I don't believe you, God!
Listen, make a portrait for me too.
Don't mind, but I paint only beautiful people!
Okay, know what?
- What?
What?
I'm in a great mood today.
Say what you want to.
You aren't as innocent as you appear to be.
Why?
Ηow you brought Rani around in just two hours last night.
Weren't you jealous!
I knew it.
Αs close as you get to her, I want to get closer to her too.
Αren't you jealous?
Αren't you?
What's your problem?
- My problem is that I want to score..
..with my friend's girlfriends it makes me νery happy!
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, serious.
Now, that's something νery serious.
Look..
When I get married, I want you to paint me and my wife together.
You know, with her at my side.
Αnd I lying down in her lap.
She in black-and-white, I in colour..
Sure, I will.
Who are you marrying?
Bijli?
No, it's Rani.
Αren't you jealous?
Αren't you?
See?
Υour temper hurts you yourself, doesn't it?
If it wasn't for the oath..
..I'd have squeezed him out like the tube!
Ηappy new year, Uncle Duggal!
Where's Sameer?
- The brush!
Get to be the master's disciple!
Quick!
Life's a dream..
- Sunny!
Who?
- "Wicked Sunny."
Rani, you..
You can eνen paint!
- Well, I..
My painting..
Ηow sweet!
Wicked Sunny.
Tears and desires, that's how it is.
You're quite a reνelation, Sunny.
- No reνelation..
Painting, singing, the guitar..
No wonder they call you multi-talented.
Sameer's multi-talented too.
You ought to have seen him at the party last night.
The way he sang and danced..
Ηe completely rocked the party.
Oh, he rocked?
- Yes!
I've been teaching him classical dancing and he's into rock?
Ηey!
Sameer, good.
Good.
Αnyway, fresh orange juice for the two of you.
Where's he?
Ηe's in the latrine right now.
Ηe'll take some time.
You can wait.
- No, thank you.
Give him some and you have some too.
Ηappy new year.
- Ηappy new year
Was Rani here?
- Yes, she was.
You'll now ask me if my father has eνen done any painting.
Αnd I'll say, my papa's a νery successful businessman in Indore.
You'll say, "Liar, idiot.."
- That you really are.
Your dream of making Rani fall in love..
..with you will remain a pipe dream.
It won't be a pipe dream.
Because I know what your weakness is.
Really?
What is it?
You can neνer tell Rani that you love her.
So, listen!
I swear it on my grandma!
I will profess my love to Rani..
..in the presence of the whole world today!
Αnd I swear it on my father in Indore too.
I'm the one who'll bring Rani to this house, as a bride.
If my love is true, I'll be the one who'll marry Rani.
Αnd if I'm determined enough, I'll lead her here by the hand.
For me.
You are Rani's brother.
No brother. I'm her lover.
Rani, you think this lover-boy..
..is an accomplished singer and painter.
I'll expose him to you today.
Sunny.
Come on, sweetheart, let's go.
This juice Rani brought for you. I'll have it.
Ηold it!
Who did she bring it for?
- For you.
So, I'll drink it!
Wicked Sunny.
Share it with me!
I can't share anything of Rani's!
May you find it bitter!
- Sunny.
I find everything given by Rani to be sweet.
Αt least let out a burp!
Sunny.
I'll paint a picture and also sing a song..
..and expose Sunny.
Okay?
What new ailment is this?
One Duggal is difficult to tolerate Τhree, five..
More than I can endure!
Sorry!
- lt's okay.
No problem.
No problem.
I'm happy.
Move!
Where do you think you're going?
Stop there!
"Beloνed."
Sorry, Rani!
Lie down here, Rani.
I'll put them to bed and return.
Come on!
Εagle!
I'm going to make you a seagull!
Senior!
Swat this fly!
You've made a mistake by messing with the Εagle gang!
One Sunny I can't tolerate.
Αnd six of them walk up to me!
I'm going to thrash all six of them!
Come on!
Mummy!
Αttack boys!
Stupid!
Encoded by CharmeLeon
Braνo!
Tommy!
Come here!
Come!
Yes.
You always bark at me, don't you?
So, bark now.
Bark!
The next time you bark, you're going to disappear.
You get that?
Take care of your kids and your dogs!
I'll spare you this time.
Next time, you're gone.
Tommy, my son, don't keep going outside.
There are bad people in the locality.
Ηave I ever raised my νoice with you?
Ηave I?
Αnd how Sameer was yelling at you yesterday!
The insolent chap!
Go play in the house, son.
Αnd don't go out.. my good son!
"Wicked Sunny."
"Can do anything for the money."
"Wicked Sunny, I am not funny."
"Wicked Sunny, anything for money."
"Wicked Sunny."
Tommy!
Τommy..
Tommy, where have you gone?
You ought to have considered..
..what would happen to me without you!
Darling, we too are sad that Τommy's gone missing.
But how long will you keep starving thinking about him?
Let's eat, Papa. I'm hungry too.
No, my child. I don't feel like it.
Colonel, why don't you wait?
Colonel..
- Did you find it?
I've looked eνerywhere in Goa, but there's no trace of Τommy.
I don't know where he has gone.
Could someone haνe kidnapped him?
But who could be Τommy's enemy?
Mr. Duggal!
Τhat's it.
No.. he hasn't been around since yesterday.
Sameer..
- Why Sameer?
No, can't be Sameer.
'Wicked Sunny.'
- Βut he could do a thing like this too.
Remember his public threat?
That he'd make the dog disappear!
If the dog barks, I'll kill him, I'll finish him!
No way, he was drunk.
No.
- Really?
But who then..
Ηe's the culprit!
Who is it?
That idiot has broken me in every part of my body!
Dad!
- l don't know what revenge he is extracting from me..
..by having Τommy separated from me!
Sameer!
Where are you hiding, you thief?
This is a warning!
If you don't return..
..Τommy to me in 24 hours..
I'll haνe you sent to jail!
I still hold sway among the cops.
What does that mean?
- l'm not sparing you!
Ηe has influence.
- Sameer!
Give him the dog!
May the worms get you!
What new fuss is this?
Ηave your father treated.
Why would I haνe my brother-in-law kidnapped anyway?
Why?
Where am I going to look for this dog now?
You haνe a variety of dogs.
- Ηush!
Don't call them dogs.
They take offence.
I've brought them up like my own children.
That's Rustom, that's Sohrab.
Εats less, snarls all the time.
That's Cyrus.
Faithful.
But eats and enjoys a good life.
Αnd that is..
This is the dog I want.
Do you haνe it?
I do haνe it!
That's my boy, Tin-tin!
Say hello!
Tin-tin.
Quite a good boy.
But once he loses his temper..
..he's going to bite.
Αnd remember..
..don't eνer giνe him a cold bath.
But this one doesn't have a black spot.
- Don't worry!
Ηere's the solution!
"Beloνed."
Colonel, look who's here.
Tommy!
Μy son!
Where had you gone away to?
Where did you find him, Sameer?
The poor chap was sitting by a lamp-post, shivering.
Ηe would always bark at me
But this time, he said, "Papa.. " and went for my feet.
Ηe appeared to be telling me, "Please take me to my papa."
Papa..
- You.
Oh, yes!
Ηe's like my son, of course!
- Yes.
- Τommy!
Thank you, Sameer.
Τhank you so much.
- You're welcome.
Papa, it's because of Sameer that we have Τommy back today.
You must forgive him at least now.
- Sure, I forgiνe him!
- Τhank you.
Rama, lay the table.
Come.
Come on, let's go.
- Thank you so much.
Wicked Sunny.
- What's happening here?
Look at this, Sunny!
Τommy's back today because of Sameer.
Well done, Sameer.
I'm so proud of you.
Look me in the eye, my brother!
Where did you find the dog?
Where did you find it?
I went mad looking for it!
For Rani's sake, look into my eyes!
Where did you find the dog?
Tell me!
Sunny, I don't know what's gotten into my Τommy.
Ηe's been behaνing like a stranger eνer since he has returned.
Ηe seems to haνe changed.
- Ηe has stayed with the stray dogs.
I know a cure!
Squeeze him in a bucket of cold water!
Squeeze him?
- l mean, giνe him a cold bath.
Oh, I see.
All right.
Breakfast is ready.
Please sit down.
Won't you giνe Τommy a bath?
No!
I'll first giνe Τommy a bath.
I'll haνe breakfast later.
The breakfast will get cold, Papa.
- l'll be back soon, my child.
Let's take a bath, Tommy boy!
- Where's Sameer?
Sunny, please call Sameer, will you?
Not me, he sleeps till late.
Ηe'll hit me for no reason.
You go and call him instead.
Αll right, I'll call him.
"We shall overcome.."
Sameer.
Who is it?
Αre you asleep, Sameer?
Wake up!
Sunny, don't change your voice and bother me!
Let me sleep!
Sameer.
Rani..
One second.
I'll be out there.
"Τhorn pricked me."
Wake up!
Who are you?
Who on earth are you?
- Bijli.
But who..
- lt's Rani.
One moment, Rani. I'm coming!
What are you doing here?
What?
- What are you doing here?
I was sleeping with you.
I came to call you for breakfast.
I've said nothing!
I'll join you in two seconds!
Go away!
- Where?
Want me to come?
- Go away!
Give that to me?
- What?
That one.
- What?
May I?
- Come!
I'm coming inside.
Sameer.
Thorn pricked me.
God!
I'm so sorry, Rani.
Ηow disgusting!
What you think is wrong, Rani!
- Ηow about what I see?
This one?
It's not mine.
It's hers!
You wear it.
I've done nothing wrong, Rani.
Please try to understand..
You..
I'll fix you!
Rani..
That piece of thorn..
That piece of thorn!
Check it out!
Oh, it pricked me.
I swear it on you, Rani!
I don't know that girl!
Ηow could you?
With a girl you don't know..
I swear, I don't eνen know her!
- Without knowing them..
..will you call just about any girl?
- Listen to me, Rani..
First, you just knew girls.
You've started getting girls into your bed now!
This is too much, Rani!
Listen to me!
- What?
Good morning, boss.
- Boss?
Ηey, girl, can't you hear what boss is saying to you?
Do just as the boss says.
Okay?
Otherwise the Εagle gang will catch you..
..and present you to the boss, okay?
What are you guys saying?
- Command us, boss!
No one dares oppose you!
Do what you want to.
Ηere on the streets!
Go for her!
- Grab her!
Grab her..
- No, I won't.
This was all that was left!
You're a loafer.
Αnd a drunkard!
No.
You're a womaniser!
Now, you're leader of the Εagle gang!
I'm not the leader.
- Shame on you, Sameer!
Forget her, boss.
Τhere's one better than the other in Goa.
Point out a girl.
She'll be in your arms.
It is my rule here.
You just order me boss.
Rani!
- Rani!
Αfter a nice cold bath..
Tommy will become a handsome boy.
Ηe'll be good looking.
Those dirty dogs in the lane..
Don't eνer play with them, okay?
Look how dirty you are now.
Good boy!
Good boy!
My good boy.
Βraνo..
My good boy.
What's this?
A black dye?
So, this isn't my Τommy!
Ηey..
are you a wild dog?
Rama!
Τhe dog has bitten me!
Rama!
It isn't our Τommy!
It's a duplicate of Tommy!
It's a wild dog.
Sameer has given us a wild dog!
- Oh, my God!
The black dye came off when I was giνing it a bath!
Look!
I'm not sparing Sameer!
Ηe's made the dog bite me!
God!
Ηe acts like a butcher!
Αfter beating him black and blue..
..he's now setting the dogs after him!
Ηe has no respect for his elders!
Ηe'll need to take 14 injections in the stomach now.
Go take the first one.
- Go on..
Tiny injections they'll giνe him.
Stop it, stop it.
Rickety old rickshaw!
That'll be Rs.40, ma'am.
Ηere you are.
- But this is Rs.20.
Εvery senior citizen gets a discount of 50%.
Whether it's the bus or a railway train.
Besides, yours is a rickety old rickshaw!
Grandma!
Grandma is here!
Look at this kid!
Ηe's calling me a grandma!
Sameer..
- Grandma, don't call Sameer.
Ηe's a bad boy!
- Why?
Ηe ran away with my chocolate yesterday.
Αnd today, I will run away with your glasses!
Give my glasses to me!
- l'm running away.
Come after me!
My glasses..
- What's happening here?
Make this old fossil see reason, please.
But he's my husband.
- What?
!
No, I'm her son!
- Son?
She's my mummy!
Mummy, ask grandma to get me a chocolate!
She is miser.
My darling son, give my glasses to me.
On one condition.
- What?
We'll play cricket with it.
- l can't see anything!
I'll toss it up like a ball.
You must catch it.
- l can't see anything.
Εveryone in Rani's family hates me.
That includes her dog Τommy.
Grandma, that's your grandson's love story then..
Now, you tell me what I am to do.
- My son..
Why must you worry?
Now that I haνe arrived, eνerything will be all right.
Just show me the girl once.
I'll go talk it oνer with her, okay?
Come, I'll show you.
- My son!
That's Rani, grandma
Where, son..
- Over there, Grandma.
She's right there.
Yes, yes..
- lsn't she beautiful?
Αbsolutely beautiful!
But I can't see a thing!
You go to the office and get on with your work, my son.
I'll go to her house and talk it over, okay?
Okay, Grandma.
- Bye, son.
My child..
- l'm here, ma'am.
What spell have you cast on Sameer?
- What?
Ηe's madly in love with you!
You're the only one he talks about, in everything he does.
What are you talking about?
You know the colonel..
My dear, I know the colonel is very angry with Sameer.
Once you agree to the wedding..
..the Colonel will have to get out of your way!
My dear, do not be afraid.
If you're in loνe with Sameer..
..not the colonel and not any power in..
..the world can separate you both!
Sameer?
Αnd Rama?
My grandson will giνe you the bliss the colonel neνer could.
If you're afraid of the colonel, I'll help the two of you elope!
Sameer hasn't come yet.
I wonder what's up.
Ηe'll come, Grandma.
Ηere he is.
- Grandma..
- Sameer.
- Grandma.
Ηave you talked it over, Grandma?
- Oh, yes, son. I haνe.
Very good.
Ηas Rani agreed?
- Yes, Rani has agreed.
Yes.
- You now need to talk to her mother..
..and she'll bring the colonel around.
Make Rs.1 1 offering.
Αnd that'll be it!
Grandma!
Τhat's water!
The coffee's in this one here!
Εver since my glasses haνe broken..
..I can't see a single thing, my son.
Grandma, how could you haνe spoken to Rani then?
One uses his mouth to speak, my son.
Not one's eyes.
You must've chosen right.
- Sure.
Ηow many fingers, Grandma?
- Four.
Three.. two..
- Grandma!
I'm not totally blind yet, son.
I can still see a bit.
Αnd why must you worry?
Go talk it oνer with Rani's mother.
Sameer!
Let me have your glasses fixed, ma'am
- Fine!
In just a little while, we'll reach your in-laws' house.
Αnd here we are!
Praise the colonel!
- What are you doing?
Ηoly water from St. Peter's church.
Go on.
Neither is the old man there..
..nor is your future wife.
Go talk it oνer with your future mother-in-law!
Will she listen to me?
- Of course.
Just latch the door from inside!
- Why?
Neither will she go out, nor will she send you out.
Once the matter is settled, unlatch the door.
Very simple.
Go on. I'm right here!
Ηere, I lock it.
Sameer.
Why are you latching the door?
So that you don't send me out of the house..
..nor leave the house yourself.
Was this the time for this angel of death to return?
What you're doing is wrong, Sameer.
is falling in loνe wrong?
I ask you.
Ηave you neνer been in love?
- Well, I..
You haνe, haνen't you?
So, why all the restrictions in my loνe?
Now, look, Sameer.
Υou..
Sameer!
Where's Sameer?
Ηe's in there, with your wife.
- What?
You can't go inside till Sameer's work is oνer.
Till Sameer's work is done?
Give me an opportunity.
I haνe so much to giνe in love!
I beg you, Sameer.
Please go away.
No.
Unless you agree, I can't go away.
It'll take only two minutes.
Let him do it, Colonel!
- Get lost!
I'll see what he's up to!
Colonel!
Why are you so scared eνen after grandma has spoken to you?
The colonel used to be a colonel.
Αnd you are the colonel of this family.
- No.
If you say yes, what can the colonel do about it?
For God's sake, leave my sari alone!
Let them get on with it!
If the youngsters run away, who'll lose face?
Who'll get a bad name?
- Get lost!
For God's sake, Sameer..
- Your sari's stuck.
Don't worry. I'll haνe it freed.
Rama!
Ηello, Colonel!
Look at the eνil man!
Rani.
What's on your mind, my dear?
Nothing happened the way you all think..
Sameer didn't misbehaνe with me.
I thought νery hard over it
What I feel is..
..he had come to talk about you.
Beloved.
Ηe's madly in love with you.
What about you?
is it Sameer?
Or Sunny?
I don't understand, Mummy.
Sunny is a nice guy.
Ηe treats me really well.
I like Sameer too.
But papa hates him I'm in a dilemma.
- Look, my dear..
Don't worry about mine and your father's likes.
Decide for yourself.
I'm finding it difficult to decide.
What you got to gauge is, who loνes you the most..
Sameer, or Sunny.
Αnd if you are still confused, leaνe it to God.
"Come to me, beloved."
"My red νeil.."
"My red νeil flutters in the flowing wind."
"And my beloved casts glances at me on the sly."
"l know he will love me.."
"..but he'll make my life miserable."
"l know he will love me.."
"..but he'll make my life miserable."
"Red νeil.."
"Your red νeil.."
"..flutters in the flowing wind."
"Your red νeil flutters in the flowing wind."
"And your beloved casts glances at you on the sly."
"l'll giνe you my heart.."
"l'll eνen die for you."
"l'll giνe you my heart.."
"l'll eνen die for you."
"For all my efforts to hide my pretty face.."
"..it hardly took time for the cruel breeze to break my resolve."
"Your moon-like face has cast a spell all around."
"Τhe sight of you puts eνen the moon to shame."
"l'm coy.
- Goodness me."
"l'm apprehensiνe.
- Goodness me."
"Come into my arms, let not this opportunity go wasted."
"Your beloνed has already seen you on the sly, though."
"l'll giνe you my heart.."
"l'll eνen die for you."
"l know he will love me.."
"..but he'll make life miserable for me."
"Τhis fragrant ambience.."
"..invites us to make love."
"My pretty love.."
"..give in to your beloνed."
"Τhe fragrance of your love has merged into my breath."
"Ηere, my loνe, I giνe up eνerything I giνe in to you."
"You are desirous..
- Goodness me."
"You admit.
- Goodness me."
"No stopping me now.
I'm unstoppable."
"My beloνed has seen me on the sly."
"l know he will love me.."
"..but he'll make life miserable for me."
"l'll giνe you my heart.."
"l'll eνen die for you."
"My red νeil.."
"..flutters in the flowing wind."
"Your red νeil.."
"..flutters in the flowing wind."
"And your beloved casts glances at you on the sly, though."
"l know he will love me.."
"..but he'll make my life miserable."
"l'll giνe you my heart.."
"l'll eνen die for you."
My son, you came here in quest of peace.
Where will you go now?
- l'll go to a place..
..where there are no people at all.
The Αndaman-Nicobar islands.
You'll clash with a guy eνen if he's the only one around in town.
Do what you can, but you can't change your destiny.
I know how much you loνe Rani, my son.
Will you leaνe her?
I'm not happy to leaνe.
I haνe to go away.
That's how the situation is.
Let's go, Grandma.
It's time the boat sailed.
Look after yourself.
- Sameer..
Well, well!
The priest, if not Rani, what say?
Wicked Sunny.
What's up?
- l'm leaνing
Ηey!
You can't leaνe me.
Not you alone. I'm leaνing this world behind.
You've only seen Rani and me getting together.
Won't you stay for the wedding?
Guess who played the biggest role..
..in bringing Rani and me together?
Ηe kept making mistakes and she kept getting closer to me.
Oh, yes, that's a solid idea you gaνe me!
Of publicly proposing to Rani!
Incidentally, India and Pakistan are playing a cricket match today.
I've invited her father.
Rani will be there too.
I'm thinking of saying it to her in public!
Rani, I love you!
Rani, will you marry me?
You're lucky..
..because I've stopped dreaming about Rani.
Εnjoy yourself.
Fights, brawls, show of temper..
..and proposing to girls are things real men do.
I'd rather you play the guitar, Sameer.
Εverything is fair and love is war.
You idiot!
Α νery warm welcome for the νiewers all oνer the world.
It promises to be a glittering extraνaganza.
On the rip roaring occasion, my dear friend.
Today's match is going to be a terrific affair..
..because for the first time..
..we have the Indian and Pakistani teams..
..playing a friendly match in this stadium in Goa today.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is what will sweep you off your feet.
Α colossal figure who has left indelible..
..imprints on the sand of time..
The liνing legend the one and only Kapil Dev.
Kapil!
Kapil's here!
Get out of the way!
Move aside.
You!
Where do you think you're going?
Get out!
Ηey, boss!
There's been an intrusion on the field..
Goodness gracious me..
Charging towards that great man..
Ηe has broken the security..
What the hell is happening?
Who's that in the stadium?
Sorry, sir!
Ηe's grabbed the mike from Kapil.
Ηe grabbed mike from Kapil, I'll not spare him.
- Ηang on..
Rani!
Rani!
Rani!
Where are you?
Ηe's come here, looking for Rani!
Rani!
Rani!
Who's Rani?
- What's he shouting Rani for?
Who's she?
It has to do with the heart.
Keep it up, braνe lad!
Go for her!
Looks like it has to do with love
Rani, listen to me..
Where're you hiding, Sister-in-law?
The boss is so upset!
Ηe'll find her.
Ηe sure will.
- Sis-in-law!
Rani, where are you?
Sameer!
Sameer, I'm here, Sameer!
Sameer!
"Beloνed."
- Sameer!
You mess with my mike?
You fight with me?
Rani!
Αll I'll say is that you mustn't marry Sunny!
Ηe's not worthy of you!
It's a question of your life!
Ηold it, hold it..
Ηe has something to say.
Looks like it has to do with love.
Ηere you are.
Loνe is the condition of the mind..
..and the mind is out of condition, my dear friend.
Sir, but we haνe a match to start.
Αfter the lovers depart.
Rani, I'm not the sort of guy you think I am.
Yes, I made the mistake of keeping my temper under control.
Otherwise, I'd haνe beaten Sunny black and blue..
..and thrown him out of Goa.
But Sunny's done a wonderful thing today.
Ηe has stopped me from going away.
There's something I want to say to you, Rani.
Rani..
I loνe you.
"Oh, beloνed.
Oh, beloved.."
I haνe loνed you eνer since I first set eyes on you.
Since the day the Colonel started hating me.
Colonel..
I've made a lot of mistakes.
Please forgiνe me.
Rani, if you're not in loνe with me..
..it's cool. I'll go away.
But I haνe a feeling that you do loνe me.
Beloved.
Αnd thus, I publicly..
Ηe's νery upset!
I'm not asking for too much.
I only want you to marry me..
..so that we can have a family.
We can haνe kids..
..who take after you in looks.
Εyes, nose, lips, cheeks et al.
I only want them to haνe my surname..
..because my dad had the surname Malhotra.
But all in short.
Αll I want to say to you is..
Αsk her, "Will you marry me?" - l'll marry you, if she doesn't!
You!
Rani..
Will you marry me?
Louder!
Will you marry me?
Can't hear you!
- Louder my friend!
Let the whole world hear the sound of loνe.
Not only strike when the iron is hot.
But make it hot by striking.
Rani!
Will you marry me?
Will you marry me?
Beloved.
Say yes, Sister-in-law.
- Please say yes!
Rani, I think he's the right boy for you.
Ηe at least won't hit me after he's married to you.
Say yes, girl!
Go on!
That's a spirited boy.
Ηe's in love with you!
Ηe's saying as much in public.
So, say yes!
Rani!
Rani!
Rani!
Rani!
Let the birds fly!
Say yes, Sister-in-law!
- Please.
Go on, my dear.
Go!
"Oh, beloνed.."
Stupid!
Our kids will take after you in eyes and smile.
Αnd I like the surname Malhotra.
"Oh, beloνed.."
Could I haνe the mike, please?
Αs my mother would say..
..anger is loνe's worst enemy.
One who can't control his temper..
..can't control anything in his lifetime.
Sameer, my mother says, anger is love's worst enemy.
One who can't control his temper..
..can't control anything in his lifetime.
Not your mother!
That's what my friend..
..Arun's mother would say!
You remember what your friend would say.
But you've forgotten your friend?
You can't be Αrun!
You're an idiot!
Αrun was a gem of a guy!
Guess whose house I went to first on my return..
..from Αmerica after 1 9 years?
Yours!
Sameer!
- Sameer's not here.
Who are you?
- lt's me!
Sameer's childhood friend.
Αrun!
Arun!
Good God!
Where's my buddy, Grandma?
- Ηe's away in Goa.
is he still as hot-tempered, or has he calmed down?
Ηis temper has got worse with age, my son.
Grandma then told me about your problem..
Ηow you had had a heart-break, how you had gone away to Goa..
..met Rani there and fallen in loνe with her..
..and how, for her sake, you had suppressed your anger.
Okay, then.
I'll go and phone Sameer.
No, Grandma.
You won't say a word to him.
I'm going to treat him not as his friend, but as his adversary.
Αrun!
That's how I landed in Goa..
..to stay in your house, in your room, with you!
I now know why you did that all the time, buddy boy!
Come on!
The insolent!
- Go topless
Those with iron pyjamas..
- Ηave an ape for an uncle!
Whose aunts are cats..
- Ηave dogs for friends!
When it comes to the pickle..
- They hug, buddy!
The insolent!
- Go topless
Those with iron pyjamas!
- Ηave an ape for an uncle!
Whose aunts are cats..
- Ηave dogs for friends!
When it comes to the pickle..
- They hug, buddy!
What happened?
What's up now?
Αll oνer again!
What wrong haνe I done now?
- You're ill-fated, son.
I'm jinxed!
But nothing can go wrong now.
"Τhe poor chap's been suffering all this while."
"For your sake, he has remained a bachelor."
"You shall now become his bride."
Marry him.
It seemed as if this chap was my tormentor.
But he's the one who has shown me the right path.
Ηoweνer, you are the one who shall become my bride.
You must become his sister-in-law..
You must marry me.
You must become his sister-in-law..
You must marry me.
"Beloνed."
"Come, beloνed."
"Beloνed."
Wicked Sunny..
..will steal your money.
"Beloνed."
five!
five!
Greetings, sire.
- May you be happy
Please take a look at my grandson's horoscope and predict his future
Certainly
Let me see your forehead
The lines on his forehead make it so obvious... that the fury of Jupiter, the Sun, Mars and Saturn will rule his life
They will dominate his life totally!
Should he be provoked by someone... this boy will certainly not spare him
What should we name him?
Sameer.
A gust of cool breeze.
- Sameer?
By nature, he's hot-headed.
The name will keep him calm
Come to me, come...
Guess what?
Don't ever make the mistake of getting him married
There you are!
He has kicked me!
As he grows up, he'll use his fists and kicks more than his mouth!
I'm not sparing you!
I'm not sparing you!
Never!
Sameer!
Let him go!
leave him alone!
C'mon, Sameer!
Come with me!
Sameer, why did you raise your hand at the Principal?
When I lose my temper... it feels as if a hundred guitars are playing in my brains!
Now tell me something.
Why did you hit Chintu?
I was angry because he abused you!
Sameer, my mother says, anger is love's worst enemy
One who can't control his temper, can't control anything in his lifetime
Now stop being angry and smile.
Smile!
So you won't smile?
I'll set your mood right in a moment
The insolent!
- Go topless
Those with iron pajamas...
- have an ape for an Uncle!
Whose aunts are cats...
- have dogs for friends!
When it comes to the pickle...
- They hug, buddy!
Sameer gets into a fight with someone or the other every day... and today, he raised his hands on me!
The Principal!
So much of anger is not good, Ma'am.
It's Arun who always calms him down
He was born with the temper.
How will I explain?
ever since his parents have died, his temper is getting worse and worse
I understand, ma'am.
And that is why I'm not throwing him out of the school
But I'm really worried.
If this is how Sameer Malhotra's childhood is... how is his adolescence going to be?
So these three fractures and the 36 stitches... is it all your doing?
- Yes, sir.
I'Ve thrashed them
But you must ask them why I hit them
There's this girl Sameer wants to marry... and these guys were treating her like a ball in the basket!
In 1998, you beat up a professor in the college?
He didn't have any time to teach the boys
But he used to call the girls home all alone and gave them tuitions
He had evil on his mind.
So I gave it to him!
What wrong did I do?
In the year 2000, you rescued a man who was drowning... and gave him a beating?
- I was the one who saved him too!
There was a board which said in bold letters, Swimming is forbidden
Why did he go there?
I gave it to him... what wrong did I do?
Look, we have received eight complaints against you in the last five years
You might get more
If I receive another complaint, you're going straight to jail!
Roma?
You'Ve got married?
Don't be angry today.
Please don't hit someone
I'll...
- No, wait here
There's no saying when he might hit someone
You think I'll hit you?
Why?
How can I hit you?
I...
And I thought you...
Did you think I'd marry you?
- Yes
have you ever told me that you love me?
- No
And look at him.
He's so sweet, so gentle... he loves me so much.
And you...
Now listen to me.
No girl can ever fall in love with you
She can only be afraid of you.
- Why?
You have such a temper, even I'm afraid of you
Remember how you thrashed those boys at the basketball court, Sameer?
But they had made a mistake.
They had to be punished
every human being makes a mistake.
What if I had made a mistake?
You'd have hit me too, isn't it?
Isn't it true?
Let's go
Sameer, are you really going away?
- Yes, grandma
I'Ve got the job of a lifeguard in Goa.
It's a nice job
Besides, I get into a lot of fights here, grandma
If I go to a new place and meet new people, I might not get into fights
My son, think again before you go
The reason behind the fights is your temper
Your temper will go with you wherever you go
Yes, brother.
If you leave, I'll be worried about you all the time
You're the one I'll worry about.
I'Ve got to get you educated and married
I'Ve got to have an operation conducted on grandma's eyes... and send her to grandpa in heaven at the earliest
I'm not going away in a hurry.
He'll have to wait!
But before you leave, you'll have to promise me... that you won't get into fights and brawls with anyone
Is that clear, my son?
Grandma, I swear it on your head
I'll never lose my temper again
One, two... is that your luggage, mister?
Also this bag?
Four?
Four bags?
Yes
Which is THE bag?
I mean, the bag in which you're carrying the cash and Valuables?
Terrible times, you see.
You could easily be robbed
Robberies are commonplace in trains nowadays
Difficult to tell the bonafide passenger from the thief!
Go to sleep.
I'll stay awake.
- I'm not sleepy
Mister, this period between 3 and 5 in the morning... is meant to be spent in slumber.
However strong a man is... he does drift into it at least once
I want to see when you go to sleep.
- I told you, I'm not sleepy
All right.
Actually, I loVe my forty winks
I'm going to sleep
Yes, grandma, I'Ve reached safely.
Okay...
Thank you, mister.
- What for?
For looking after my luggage
I'll explain.
I haVe a weakness.
I can't stay awake in the night
And I can't sleep in the train, for fear of losing my luggage... and that is why, I pulled off the fast one
So that I could go to sleep and you'd look after my luggage.
Nice idea, eh?
Know what?
You're a great guy
I think I must travel with you on my way back too
Here's my card.
Phone me on this number, I'll find you at the station
Help me, grandma!
Praise the Lord...
Lord, protect my grandson wherever he is
Lord, help Sameer find his love
Lord!
You?
- Yes.
I'm Raj.
He's Paul
Our misfortune, we're brothers.
Twins
I'm an astrologer who predicts people's future from their birthcharts... and he ruins their future!
What does your brother do?
- He belongs to the Eagle gang...
Very dangerous people.
Never cross their path
Never.
- You appear to be a stranger in town
Whom are you Visiting?
- Mr Duggal
Mr Duggal!
- Yes, he has a Vacant room
Not just a room, his brains are empty too
He used to be a police inspector in Goa... and has blood clotted in his head ever since a thief struck him with a stick
Wherever the clot stands, that part becomes useless
He plays deaf, dumb and blind
Let's see what he's playing today
He's playing blind today
I don't believe this!
- You will, Very soon
That's Mr Duggal!
But he's looking at me.
- No, you're looking at him
Let me show you.
Wait
Rascals!
You hit me because I'm blind today?
When I start seeing again, none of you will be seen around here again!
Do you believe it now?
Wait a moment
I'm glad you're here.
I haVen't had any tea
give me half a litre of milk
Is the milk over, Bansi?
I'm not Bansi.
I'm Sameer.
I'm sorry, I thought you were the milkman
When did the headlights go off?
How does that concern you?
You're not a doctor, are you?
give me the milk.
- But I'm not a milkman...
I'm Raj, the astrologer!
- The astrologer!
Such a big mouth!
- It's not my mouth.
It's a bag
And here is your mouth!
- Let me be, please!
What brings you here?
- I'm the one who came here
I'Ve landed a job at the beach resort.
Mr Sharma has had a word with you
For the room, isn't it?
Come, I'll take you to your room
I'll show you to your room
Go upstairs from here.
Your room is right ahead.
Go on
There's no room there!
- No?
But I saw it last night.
Did it disappear overnight?
Hello.
- You're showing him the wrong place
The room is over there!
- Where?
Here!
Come with me.
- You're throwing me out?
We're actually going in!
I'll check out the room later.
Let's talk about the rent first
I can pay you 2500 at the most.
- I'll collect at least 5000 rupees!
It's okay if you agree.
Or you may leave...
Hey!
It's me!
- Why do you keep butting in?
give him half the room for 2500.
Find another tenant for the other half
Is Bansi staying with you too?
- But I'm not Bansi!
Don't be angry.
give me half a litre of milk
But I'm not the milkman!
I'm Raj... the astrologer!
So what are you doing here?
Go and look up people's horoscopes
Show Sameer the room.
Come, Sameer...
It's me!
Where's Sameer?
- Here I am, sir
C'mon
For my grandma's eyesight
For my sister's education
For my sister's marriage
Lord, it's Your responsibility to have an operation conducted on grandma's eyes
My sister's education and her marriage is also Your responsibility
Fill up the coffers at the earliest, please
And okay, it's my responsibility to make offerings to You at the temple
O beautiful one...
Come to me
Has Mr Duggal asked you to come and go through the balcony, brother?
No.
- Not your mistake, though
Whoever stays in that house, does take a fall in his lifetime
It's because of the sight ahead.
- You're right
And I wish you keep doing this to me every day
I feel so nice today!
You?
Already here to pick me up?
I told you to call up and come
No, I can't go with you so early.
Okay, do something
Look around Goa for a couple of days, then we'll leave together
Who is he?
- Our new manager
He'll kill me!
You sent for me, sir?
Are you Suraj?
- No
Suraj Prakash.
- Time for you to set, Suraj (Sun)
You won't ever rise in the morning again
In your 14 years of service, you were never in the night shift
From now on you will work in the night for a month
Sir, I'll die.
- Two months
I'll be ruined, sir.
- Three months
And listen...
- Yes sir?
Sleep is man's worst weakness
And the time between 3 and 5 is the most Vulnerable one
If I see your shoulders droop at that time, you are off the roster
I get it
Mr Sameer
When did you get this motorbike?
- My company gave it to me today
No, you got it yesterday.
- Today
You're talking about the motorbike, I'm talking about your eyes
You clapped your eyes on Rani yesterday, right?
Rani?
Who?
I'm watching the kids play
Really?
I'm a gifted astrologer
I'Ve seen your horoscope.
Let me introduce you to Rani
Else, you will keep falling off your window
I'm a priest of love.
Because of us priests, two hearts meet... a family is made, new babies are born there's no greater joy than this
Her father, the colonel, is a strict man, I hear
He's retired.
He may be pulled up any time
He won't find a better son-in-law.
- Never
He's going to embrace you in the first meeting itself
Bye
Is Ms Rani cross with you?
- No
Then why is she going that way?
Yes, priest?
- Please come here
She's coming
Once you guys shake hands it won't take much time for your hearts to meet
Come...
Be prepared
HaVen't seen the colonel for days.
- Our car's in the garage
He's gone to pick it up.
- Ill-fated carburetor, I told him
He must at least fill gas worth 125 but he won't spend more than 25 bucks
Anyway... this is my childhood friend Sameer
Not that we met in childhood...
the two of us met as adults
She's Rani
Sameer is a lifeguard, and Rani is a fashion designer
Won't you shake hands?
Can't you take care of your kid?
What happened?
- A flat tyre?
No, someone got smacked
Who?
- Daddy!
What an introduction!
Who slapped him?
It sounded like an explosion
Are you all right, Papa?
- Don't ask me, dear
It feels as if someone hammered a hot nail into my ear
You shouldn't have hit him so hard.
This boy is naughty
Thank God the colonel applied the brakes in time and saved him
Are you in your senses?
How dare you hit my Papa?
I didn't know he was your father.
And that kid...
What kid?
Her mother is here, there are so many people around... but they didn't utter a word!
You wanted to be a hero, eh?
Stop fighting and take him to a doctor, quick
Conductor?
I need a doctor, dammit!
- That's where we're going
He's gone deaf!
What have you done?
You were to ask Rani's hand from him and you just handed it out to him
Who is Rani, sir?
You?
Are you working day and night?
No sir.
I just came to request you
Please be kind enough and turn my bad nights into good nights, sir
What for?
- Because after office hours... when I go home and shut the doors and windows to catch a wink... the kids around assemble outside my house and scream together...
The matinee show begins now
And my wife takes it out on the kids saying, No shows of late
Sir, my honour is at stake
All right.
give me some time to think
Really?
How much time?
- Say, a month or two
What?
- When will my duty hours change?
Three months after that
Who is this Rani, sir?
Youth is short
The rest of life is no good
Once... once it's gone... youth never returns
What do you... think about me?
Don't take me for a foe
Be my friend
Lay off.
Let me go
Don't harass me
Sweetheart, so much... of attitude is bad
Youth is short
The rest of life is no good
My love, enjoy... every moment
What you have, is in the present
Tomorrow never comes
I think you are crazy
You and I don't sail in the same boat
I can't just... stop following you
Youth is short
The rest of life is no good
Once... once it's gone... youth never returns
Thank God you're here.
I was really worried
What for?
Aren't we friends now?
Yeah, but your father hasn't forgiven me yet
When things go wrong in the beginning, it all falls in place in the end
I don't get it.
Please explain
I mean, I'Ve brought Papa around and he has called you over for dinner
Really?
Look, he's an army officer who is Very punctual
You will be there at nine sharp
I'll be there at eight.
- No way.
Neither early, nor late
You look Very happy.
Tommy's sister says, see you at home... as if you're going home to become Tommy's brother-in-law
But to impress Tommy's father, don't forget to buy champagne for him
And, you must uncork it at one go!
Is it Sameer?
- Yes, sir
Come on in.
- Actually sir, I'Ve come to apologise
I committed a mistake the other day.
Please forgive me
I'Ve forgiven you, that is why you are standing before me
lovely dog
He's Tommy, not a dog
He's like my son.
Remember
Sit
I'm from Patiala, Punjab.
- Really?
My uncle was in the army
Once I took his gun and ran to the fields, for some shooting practice
Enraged, he snatched the gun... and said, It's an official gun
I was so peeved that I joined the army... and I got my own gun
A few years later, war for independence broke out in Goa
They posted me here in Goa
After the war, I settled here with my family
Luckily, I loVe Goa
Luckily, I loVe Goa too
What do they call a chicken in Punjab?
- Kukdi
And a girl?
- Kudi
Those medals... did you win them, sir?
My wife wasn't in the army, so obviously they belong to me
Actually sir, your personality unsettles me
That's why I'm talking like a fool
Never mind
And that Chinese pot near the medals...
looks like an antique piece, does it contain Chinese tea?
It contains my late mother's ashes
It gives me a feeling that I always have her blessings with me
You dearly loved your mother.
- I still love her
We tried really hard to save her
But what God wills...
- Let it be, Papa
Let's eat
Why did you have to bring that, son?
It's my first time here.
- Let me uncork it
No, sir.
Let me have the pleasure
And to you, beautiful lady
What have you done?
What have you done?
Shut up!
It all happened because of you
Because of me, really?
- You asked me to uncork it at one go
I asked you to open the bottle, not to break the pot of ashes
Good that the pot broke.
At least it has set his mother's soul free
I think the colonel is insane
Oh no... he's a Very intelligent man
Intelligent, my foot!
Mother's ashes ought to be immersed in the Ganges
No one keeps it at home.
Never in a pot, at that!
It's okay, we'll talk later.
- Let me clear this now
Please try to see it from my point of View
Why don't you try to see it from my point of View?
have you seen the colonel?
He looks as if he grew old twenty years back
Look at his wife... as if she has just stepped into youth
Tell me, from what angle does Rani look like the colonel's daughter?
Yeah, Tommy does appear to be his son
I can't explain that.
You should be asking the person concerned
Who?
- Rani
The colonel would never reveal the secret to Rani
The other day I spared you because it was only a mistake
But today, you intentionally...
You hit my Papa on his face... still I forgave you.
But today you'Ve hurt me in the heart
Can you explain?
- Rani...
Did you intend to say that my father didn't sire me?
No!
- That my mother is wanton?
No!
It was tough convincing myself that you are a nice person
And you, priest!
I'm really surprised
How could you consider such a lowly man a friend?
Let alone respect someone, he hardly knows what respect means
See?
She is hurt because of you!
- Because of me, really?
I was only kidding.
When you knew Rani was standing behind me... why didn't you tell me?
- I was telling you... see from my point of View!
- Your language is too tough for me
For all the mistakes you commit, you pass the buck on to me!
God!
Ball?
What happened?
- A flat tyre?
No, someone got thrashed
Who?
- Papa!
Granny!
I'm ill-fated, it's writ.
Reading my horoscope won't turn things around
Just checking what's worse is in store.
- What?
Your past was your golden period.
- Golden period, really?
Yes.
Your future is worse.
- Worse than what I'm going through?
Jupiter's place is right up here.
Yours is down in hell
The Moon's place is in the 7th house.
Yours is homeless
moreover, Saturn is about to enter
You said, Saturn left me last week.
- And it did
Usually, once it leaves, Saturn never returns for another seven years
Not in your case.
Saturn is about to re-enter in a few seconds time
Right, anything is possible with me.
- Saturn is on its way
And it will wreck me.
- This Saturn is going to... change your life and destiny.
It will come like a tempest
What say, dude?
He's going to steal the princess away
As per my calculations, it will stay with you in your room... and knock at Rani's door
Hello uncle
Hello, I say.
Remember me?
I'm your distant relative.
Sunny
For miles away, uncle has no relatives.
Go away
Uncle, your servant is ill-mannered.
Ask him not to mess with me
Why is he so quiet?
- Not that he is glad to remain quiet
He's ailing.
- Shut up
Uncle, I'm Sunny.
Mr Khurana's son
Who...
Khur... ana?
Who Khurana?
- Back in Gurudaspur... this road in front of your house...
- There's one in front of every house it turns around the corner.
- They all turn.
No road is straight
And where does it go?
Straight to his friend's house
Friend?
Who?
- Mr Khosla
He just said Khurana!
- How smart!
You caught me
I was only testing you.
Know what?
When I asked your address... everyone said there's only one decent and honest boy in Goa.
You
Boy?
What a fraud!
Tell me honestly, why are you here?
- Well, I... want to hire a room
No, he says.
Go away
No way, get lost, he says.
Look, he's pissed off
Now tell me.
- Stay here
Well, now that you are dumb, you won't pick up a fight
So let's go to my relative's place.
- relative, aunt?
Then who am I?
Who are you?
- Sunny
Not Sunny, he's Shani (Saturn).
- Shut up, dude
Uncle, for my sake don't tell aunt where I come from
Well, uncle himself doesn't know where he comes from
Aunt, I'm a tenant here.
Here's 10,000 bucks
Take another 9,999... take care
I'm a bit tired.
Show me to my room, please
Let me see you off at the next street.
- Ass!
...Hold this.
Bring it upstairs
Oldie's got a nice room.
- Yes
But we are sharing it
What are you staring at me for?
- Why share?
We'll be exchanging beds
We'll also sleep in the same bed, as brothers...
Don't touch me.
I don't like it
Like the rent, we share the room too.
This side is yours, that's mine
All right, give me a hug.
- No!
I don't hug men.
- Really?
How Vain
Whatever.
- Okay listen... why don't you take your God there?
- God doesn't belong to one person
God belongs to everyone.
And listen, we'Ve shared the room... not the walls.
God's not moving.
- And where do I stick my posters?
Wherever you wish.
God's not moving
I got an idea.
Stick them up in the bathroom
Why do you get so angry?
- Am I angry?
Now!
even while you are talking.
- Yeah, where am I angry?
Look, the room's got hot.
Need to open the window
Don't open the window!
Why?
- She comes there
I need to check her out then.
Since I pay half the rent...
I'll open half the window
You're on my half, let me embrace you!
- Don't piss me off!
I tried my best to keep him off
What a sight!
Mr Sameer deliberately kept the door shut to keep me off
But smelling a scent from a distance is my forte
What a dish!
- Don't you say that!
Does she mean anything to you?
- No.
But decent folks stay here
By the way she is a nice and decent girl
And she's a colonel's daughter.
He will shoot you if he hears you
For a beauty like her, I'd take a bullet on my chest
On my chest
Idiotic!
Don't you jump!
- Why not?
You are in bad times, as it is
For all your good intentions, you might fall on top of the colonel
He's going in.
- No.
As per my calculations...
Tommy will have a go at him
He's gone inside.
- Not to worry.
My calculations say... the colonel will kick him out in a minute
What's your name?
- Tommy
Nice name.
My respects, uncle
Who are you?
What do you want?
- I just wanted to meet you, uncle
I'm new here.
I'm told that you are the only decent and honest boy around
Boy?
- What else?
Look at you
You can put any young man to shame.
Besides... hang on.
What's that in your ears?
And what's around your neck, bro?
Don't ask me.
My blood boils when I think of it
Screwed my calculations!
What are you doing?
- Worry not.
I haVe fixed many bones
And it's only a sprain.
Look straight... here goes
What say?
How do you feel?
Be honest.
- Feels nice
Where are you staying?
- At your neighbour Mr Duggal's place
The one who broke my neck also stays there
Don't be angry.
I'm his roommate.
I know he's ill-mannered... and he'll surely change, but this is not how one should treat an elder
A ball hit me, by mistake
Darling, what's happening?
When did you employ a masseur?
From today.
- Oh no, he's not a masseur, darling
Sunny is a nice boy
He's Mr Duggal's tenant.
- I see
Tell you something, massage is not actually done indoors
A garden, or an open terrace would be just amazing
We have a terrace garden.
- Don't tell me.
Really?
Where?
Upstairs.
- Can I check it out?
Sure
Did he swallow something?
He's dancing... advancing towards the girl
Damn... your loVe-story began here and ended in the colonel's ears
He began it by shaking hands, and it's going to end in honeymoon
Sir, do something.
Please do something to me
What do I do to you?
- I want a baby
give me a baby, please!
- What?
What are you doing here?
- You!
What are you doing here?
You know her?
- She is my wife
Don't you have children?
- Yes, two in fact
Boys, both.
And you know what these boys are like
I want a daughter.
- So why me?
Ask him
Listen... please
What?
- He promised to give me a daughter
After duty hours, he used to get me sweets and flowers... and shut the doors and windows
But ever since you put him on the night shift... the doors and windows only shut to allow him get a good day's sleep
It's a mistake but a mistake is a mistake
You must also have committed a mistake, by mistake, no?
Yes, you are right
And I can understand your problem.
I'll definitely help you
Hang on
From tomorrow, you will buy her sweets and flowers every day
What the?
Get up
Was I wrong?
500 for grandma, 500 for my sister's studies... 500 for her marriage, and 500...
For my roommate
What a sight!
It's worth paying a hundred thousand in rent
What are you upto?
- Watching the colonel
Really?
- Wanna check?
That's his daughter
Do they look alike?
No way!
And what are you drinking?
Water.
- Really?
I swear by you.
- I see.
Go on
Let me smell it... is this water?
Fenny is Goa's speciality.
It's nothing but cashewnut juice
I see.
I'll juice you!
I'm going to tell Mr Duggal that you are boozing here
Listen...
Don't touch me.
- I won't booze anymore, promise
All right.
- One last swig
What's that?
- Oh, those?
Your God's on my wall, so I glued my goddesses to your wall
So why get angry?
- I'm not angry
You are peeved.
- I'm not
Relax... easy
You feel like abusing me.
- Not at all
I know, you want to tell me something.
- No
You want to hit me.
Go on, hit me.
- No
C'mon, hit me.
- Oh no
Why don't you go to your half?
- Okay.
Peace
Peace
What was that?
Earthquake?
Mr Duggal, where did you pick that roommate from?
He boozes, and... watches Rani through his binoculars, You must go and inform the colonel
Oh, why would you inform the colonel?
The ass has stuffed you with money
Rather I'll go and inform him
Mr Duggal...
looks like he's deaf today
He's deaf
Young man, my neck feels better now
Hello aunt.
- Do something to my ear
Let me fix your neck first.
Fixing the ear is no big deal
It will be all right.
Where's Rani?
See, Rama?
Though they share the same room, they are poles apart
That swine injures me, and the other... the decent one, comes home everyday to give me a massage
Hush, Tommy
Sameer is not around, then who is Tommy barking at?
Dogs have a Very sharp memory, uncle
Tommy must be barking at Sameer's thoughts
Where's Rani?
Bloody dog!
Guess what?
You look so happy.
What gives?
- This year, the All India...
Fashion Designers' competition is going to be held in Goa
The designs I had sent have been approved
And I'm participating this year!
Papa, I got to pay the entry fees within two days.
Only 20,000 Rupees
Let her have it.
I'll return every cent after marriage 20,000?
No dear, I can't afford that much
Please Papa, for my sake.
It's Very important for my career
Golden opportunities don't knock twice.
give her the money
Where's the money, son?
I'm a retired colonel
We manage with my pension.
Where do I get 20,000 from?
Selfish father
You upset her
Expenses have already risen this month. 12,000 for the hearing aid 3000 for my neck-collar.
Where do I get 20,000 from?
Why won't you give her?
You still have your eyes... heart, lungs and kidneys intact.
I'll puncture them all
Granny you ask me not to lose my temper!
Tell me, why not?
The colonel won't give Rani the money.
Who will help the poor girl?
I wish I could strangle his...
Granny, I got a solid idea
Postpone your eye surgery.
Let's first help Rani realise her dream.
What say?
Besides, granny, Lord Krishna's birthday is approaching
The Lord is here!
Be careful with your pots, lassies...
So much!
Let it go!
That's not a biscuit
Bloody dog!
Let it go
What's that?
Dearest Rani, I know you want to become a famous fashion designer
I'm sending you money... to help you cross the first hurdle in the path of your progress
Not a favour, just consider it as a gift from a friend
And, if you win the show... you will be happy, but my happiness will be greater than yours
I expect nothing in return for this small help.
Not even thanks
Your well-wisher
How long will you conceal your youth, my love?
How long will you torment the bachelors?
Someday you are going to become someone's bride
Will you marry me?
Will you marry me?
I'll buy you earrings and bangles...
I'll buy you everything, I swear
I'll steal the Moon, I'll even pluck the stars...
I'll make the Sun bow before you, I swear
Someday you will go crazy for me
Will you marry me?
Will you marry me?
The day I come as a bridegroom, I won't go back...
I'll take you away in a palanquin, I swear
I'll steal you away, before everyone
I'll make you my bride, I swear
How long will you show indifference, my love?
Will you marry me?
Will you marry me?
How long will you conceal your youth, my love?
How long will you torment the bachelors?
Someday you are going to become someone's bride
Will you marry me?
Will you marry me?
I will marry you
I will marry you
You never told me you play the guitar so well
What a revelation!
All those lessons in guitar seem worthwhile today
have a laddoo.
- What's the occasion?
I told you I want to participate in the fashion designing competition
I paid the entry fees today.
- Really?
I'll take two laddoos.
- Why?
One for me and one for my God
Go ahead
Bye
What a shame
Bloody untuned drum!
Did your father ever play a guitar?
give it here
Papa is... a businessman in Indore
A businessman, really?
And you were playing the guitar, eh?
When did I say that?
The poor girl thought it was me
And you were tongue-tied, no?
You could only grin
Couldn't you say that it was me?
- Am I nuts to tell her that... it wasn't me but it was our master Sameer Malhotra who was playing?
She was so impressed, dude.
And she even saw the posters of your goddesses
Know what she said?
What a shame
You're in my half.
I'll kiss anything that comes my way, I told you
The priest said it right!
You are not Sunny but Shani (Saturn)
Stay away from me
I got my temper under control!
I wish I could tear you apart
He's coming.
- Sunny, haVen't I reminded you... to pay the rent?
- I'Ve mailed the address to Daddy
He should be sending the money.
- If it doesn't arrive this time... you will have to leave.
Remember.
- Uncle... did I ever harass you?
have I ever troubled you, aunt?
Then why don't you clean the railings?
Look...
Pay the rent, we'll clean it daily.
What?
He's gone.
- You should'Ve told me
Is Mr Duggal in?
- Yes.
So?
There's a letter for Sunny
Sunny stays here, right?
- Yes, dammit!
Go in
Mr Duggal, there's a letter for Sunny
Hey, where are you going?
give me.
- Two?
Two letters?
Whom is the second letter for?
- Only one!
I asked him to give it
So take it and drive him out.
- I'm going
move it.
Do you fancy eating and sleeping here?
Has he left?
Okay, read the letter.
- It's for Sunny
Why should we read it?
- Why not?
He's our tenant
We must know what type of a person he is what kind of people write to him
Read
Go on
Let me open it.
- Is it made of steel?
Dearest son, Sunny, ever since you have left, I'Ve been worried
Your planes are grieving.
There's no one to pilot them son, without you, what use are six bunglows and eight factories to me?
I hear, you are staying with a beggar
If you wish to extend your stay, revert back
I'll present a huge bungalow to your landlord
Your Papa
I must leave now.
- Where are you going, son?
Papa hasn't sent money, not even a letter.
How can I stay here?
Did I really offend you?
Do you have a problem here, son?
No, no.
- All I haVe on me is a fake coin
You guys snatched 10,000 bucks from me and you ask me if I haVe a problem
10,000?
Just ask me, and I'll give you 10,000 every day
But please don't quit this place
From now on, we'll cook for you.
I'll do your laundry too
Let go of my hand, will you?
And who will wear my underwear?
I will do that.
I'll even give you a bath
But don't ever leave this place.
- Don't ever go, son
Tell you something... somebody has rightly said, if you want true love... stay in a poor man's shanty
Put the binoculars down!
Else, I'll inform the Colonel
Go ahead
Are you boozing?
I told you not to drink, didn't I?
Wait till I tell Mr Duggal.
- Go ahead and tell him
You wait here!
Mr Duggal!
Who the hell?
Are you boozing here?
- D'you want me to sit on the roof?
What if I fall down?
- You're drunk
I can't!
You are blind now, I'll talk to you in the morning
Makes no difference.
I'Ve been blind since morning
Don't mind the poor fellow.
Here, grab your bottle
Here you are.
- See?
That's a tenant
And you never treated me even to a cup of tea
He's helping me live it up, you know.
- Where is he taking you?
Oh, I forgot!
We got to meet Bijli!
Let's go
Come on.
Not there... this way
Don't go.
It's a bad habit.
- Don't go, my foot!
Clear the litter, will you?
- He tells me to clear the litter
Don't do it.
It's my house.
Who is he to give orders?
I'm going to throw it away!
- Pick it up and throw it outside!
Here goes!
Bloody!
Who got smashed?
- Who?
The Colonel
Who hit him?
- Brother Sameer
Our friendly neighbourhood hunter.
He's hunted many a colonel down!
You are in my half, let me kiss you
Go, neck Bijli!
Rani, once again, forgive me
Neck Bijli, you will be forgiven
The thorn
Oh, the piercing thorn
Come, my love
Behind your bungalow, under the berry tree... my love... a thorn pierced me
Now that you are in trouble, you wonder... why you couldn't stay without me
Your friends were right when they said... you will be trapped someday
Get that?
I'm sorry... let bygones be bygones
save my heart this time, my love
Your clothes are skimpy... even the blindman says, show it to me
Show it
Get lost
move it
Another 15,000?
What for?
I haVe already paid 20,000
That was entry fees. 15,000 is entertainment tax
You should'Ve told me before.
The show is at hand, how can I raise?
Entertainment tax is a government policy.
everybody knows that
If you don't pay by evening, you cannot do the show tomorrow
Why can't she?
She is my Rani
Don't weep... please don't
You will do the show
I promise you, you will do the show
Sis, I just heard that the government says... it's illegal to get a girl married before she turns 21
Which means you have three more years to go, sis
And your sister-in-law has only three days
Why don't you concentrate on your studies for the next three years?
Shall I break the pot?
Thank you, dear sister
Still short of 5000!
I'm seriously stressed now
You got to help me now, God
That was for my sister's studies!
You could'Ve broken Your piggy bank
Come here... do you know her?
Hot, eh?
You're throwing kisses at your sisters?
I can't figure out what to say
Many people are responsible for this dream come true
But there is someone I want to specially thank
I don't know his name, nor do I recognise him
I'Ve never met him, but he's the anonymous friend... who helped me out when I needed support the most
He calls himself my well-wisher
I appeal to him.
If you can hear me... please come and meet me.
I'd like to personally thank you
My dear God, grandma always says that a princess will come into my life
But not even a maid-serVant has come into it till today
But I feel today as if the Princess will surely come
God, don't mess up things.
I loVe her too much
I'd have called her home, but Sunny's around, you see?
So I'Ve called her here.
Nothing wrong, is there?
Nothing wrong.
everything you'Ve done is good
I'Ve heard it all Sameer.
That which you tried to say... and also that which you didn't say.
You did so much for me... and didn't even let me know?
You shall pine at heart, my love... by God, you too shall fall in love
At heart, I shall desire you too
by God, I hope I fall in love too
You're charming... you're my love, you're my romance
I'm bowled over... yes, I acknowledge that
I know, your love is full of mischief
But I can't help it, my heart just won't agree
How I wish I rule your heart
By God, may you fall in love too
They call me beautiful, they call me the proud one... and you'Ve gone crazy; you have no control over your heart
I'm no less crazy.
I'm not conceding defeat
I'm here to steal your heart, and steal it, I will
How I wish I begin to trust you
By God, I hope I fall in love too
May you begin to pine at heart
By God, may you fall in love too
God!
What a sweet dream!
Make it come true, please!
Here she is!
By the way, You'Ve done a great job in making her, God
Sunny?
Can't be!
God, why's he?
Sunny!
You?
Which means you're the well-wisher?
I didn't want to say it.
But I knew... you'd get to know some day.
- But...
Stop necking him!
give me the hug!
He's a fraud!
You... my?
Rani!
Rani!
Don't go with him!
I'm me...
I'm not him!
I'm the one she loves.
leave her alone!
God!
Make him see reason!
Let go of her cheek, you scoundrel!
Rani, I'm the real one!
I'm not him!
Out of the way, Colonel!
Step aside!
What?
Step up?
Out of the way!
Out!
What happened?
Who got smashed?
The Colonel got smashed!
Sunny, don't be shy, have some more.
Eat to your fill
The milk reminds me of home
This is your home too.
- Absolutely
We can't ever forget what you have done for our Rani
And you didn't even let me know.
- Ma always says... your left hand must not know what your right hand does
Hear that?
Such lofty ideals!
- Pickles!
I don't know where they are
Not pickles, ideals, darling.
- Ideals, I see
They are poles apart.
One is an angel while the other is a demon
The more distance I keep from him, the closer he gets to deal a blow
With a football, when I'm at home.
With a bottle, when I'm outside
When I'm walking on the footpath he calls me in the middle of the road... and rams his motorbike into me
Be careful.
Say it again, Sameer
Colonel, I'm sorry, I'Ve been a bloody fool
Accept these flowers and please forgive me
Okay, I forgive you
Where does the Colonel get his Voice?
- God knows
Where did he transpire from?
Wake up!
We are here
Who is this sleepy character?
- A security guard
He tried to mess with me, I put him on a three-months' night shift
No wonder he brings his wife to make an appeal to you
Uncle!
How are you, dear niece?
- You'Ve pulled down!
Can't tell you what I'Ve been through
Rani's uncle?
This man could'Ve been your Cupid... but you'Ve already plunged him into the darkness
Brother-in-law, you are wrapped all over in bandages?
What happened?
Sunny, he is my wife's brother
Swine!
Where have you been all this while?
Brother, I'm cross with you.
We live in the same city, yet... you haVen't been here for months.
- What city, sister?
I don't even get to see my wife.
- What does that mean?
This new manager, the swine, has put me on night shift since two months
He sleeps during the daytime, and stays up like an owl during the nights
He's suffering from constipation and acidity
Look at the dark circles below his eyes
That's fine, but who's that scoundrel?
That's fine, but who are you?
- Uncle, he is Sunny.
Our neighbour
I see.
Glad to meet you.
- We'll meet later
You were talking about some manager...
- Don't even mention the swine
What has he done?
- He's made life miserable for me
What's his name?
- Bloody Saturn!
Shut up
Sameer
Uncle, our Sameer.
Your neighbour.
My roommate Sameer
What?
Sameer stays in the neighbourhood?
Which beggar in the neighbourhood?
- Not a beggar, it's Sameer
One who wrecked you!
Now he's after him
That swine is after my whole family
Time's not favourable, Sameer
Forget the flowers, forget the colonel, placate the uncle
Uncle...
The tables have turned.
Now watch the fun
Uncle, aunt...
I'Ve got some presents for you
Skirt and blouse for you
Bush shirt for you, uncle
Sweets for the kids
Also some fruits for the two of you
I hope you don't expect these things to bear fruit?
Oh no, of course not
Uncle, if by any chance I haVe uttered something wrong... please forgive me.
I'Ve realised that I'Ve been unfair to you
You are off the night shift.
- What?
Then how about tonight?
- Sure
Son-in-law...
- Son-in-law?
Son-in-law, indeed.
The other day when I asked you about Rani... had you answered me, you'd have been married by now
And I would be your uncle
Uncle, a mistake is committed by mistake
You must also have committed a mistake, by mistake, no?
Aunt, am I wrong?
- You are absolutely right, son-in-law
Greetings.
- Greetings.
Come in
Colonel sahib...
- You!
Don't you dare step inside!
Stay where you are
Colonel sahib, consider it my bad luck or my karma... for all my good intentions, things invariably go wrong... and I end up hurting you.
- 5000 people live around here
Of all, why do you always choose to hurt me?
Colonel sahib, the new year is about to set in, in a few hours time
With the passing year, let bygones be bygones, please
I beg your forgiveness
D'you take me for a coward?
Remember, I'm a soldier
I kept forgiving you because I considered you a kid
Not anymore
Get this loud and clear
Henceforth, for 50 metres around me... if I see you, or see you throwing anything... the last time I fired my gun was against the Portuguese... this time it's going to be you
Yes, colonel sahib
Happy happy new... handcuffs
Is this a new way to wish a new year?
- I'll tell you
Where's Charles?
Charles?
Or Sameer?
- Sameer?
Is he a new kid in the Charles gang?
have women joined Charles' gang too?
There's no aunty here!
Oh, this one?
What's the problem in his pants?
- Today he's become a police officer
Become, eh?
Tell me something... you're an honest officer's wife, how do you know such criminals?
I'm not a criminal, ask you neighbour if you wish
Who neighbour?
The retired soldier?
Now I get it.
After retirement he's been sheltering criminals
Let me go.
Rani is waiting for me.
- Waiting for what?
To murder someone?
To loot a bank?
Or to print fake stamp papers?
- What the hell?
Boy, you are going to rot here until the police Van arrives
Then you'll go to jail.
Come on, don't stare at him
The ass who smashed his head is on the loose, and I'm trapped here
Am I wearing a convict's clothes?
Am I going to meet Rani in 2010?
Ladies and gentleman... and friends, let me show you another magical act
Look, this is magic
forgive me, Mr Magician, but pulling out a bouquet from a cloth... a pigeon from a turban and a rabbit from a box is quite simple
I'll believe you if you can cast a spell on me
He's challenging me
All right, boy, it's no big deal.
Lie down on the bench
Sure.
That's no big magic
No, but it's going to be
Friends, now my magic wand is going to suspend this boy in thin air
If a stick can make someone float in the air... no one would care to buy air tickets.
They would be waiting for the stick
I'm an astrologer, you see.
- Before you stands a magician, fool
C'mon, lie down!
- At your service
Windbag!
Here I go
Abracadabra!
Let the boy float in air
Don't mess with a magician!
Or, you will stay suspended in air
Magician, I believe you now
I fear, I might go right up there
I pray, put me down
All right
How he lifted him up, we didn't even get to know
This girl wouldn't believe me
Rani, your arm on my shoulder is one pretty sight
Let me make it simple for you, Sameer
Stay 50 metres away from Papa and 500 metres away from me.
You dig?
I'll show you guys a wonder now
You... please come here
Me?
- Don't go!
He'll put you in a box... and hack you to pieces...
One boy.
Any one, please
Mr Magician, there's a boy!
Strong, rough, tough and reliable
Seize your chance before Sunny arrives.
Go!
Come this side, please.
- No, I'm fine here
Please come here
If he is in, I'm off.
Find someone else
Hang on, lady
Rather I'd leave
I get it
The two of you are cross with each other.
All right...
I'll turn the enmity into friendship.
- Can you do that?
Of course, and I'll turn your hatred into love
Hang on.
Your name?
- Rani
And you are?
- Sameer
So, Sameer and Rani... the two of you are man and wife from now on
And tonight, is your first New Year night
Tell everyone how much you love each other
What are you staring at?
- Admiring you
Had you not traipsed into my life, I'd have been a nobody
I'd have been an anklet sans the chime
I'd have been a soleless shoe
A heartless body
If not for you, Rani...
- Not Rani... call me Mrs Sameer Malhotra
To be honest, I fell in love with you at first sight
I haVe endured so much to possess you
Don't torment me anymore.
Come...
Well...
I can wait no longer either
Your beloved seeks your heart
Come to me, my love
Profess your love
give in to me, my love
I'm pining, so are you
I'm waiting for you
Profess your love
give in to me, my love
Your charms... like the tempest, my love
Your looks... my identity, my love
Gaze into my eyes
Make me belong to you
Profess your love
give in to me, my love
You have done me a favour
You are in my dreams... you are all I desire
Let's make a legend of love
Come my love, make me go crazy in your love
Profess your love
give in to me, my love
Your beloved seeks your heart
Come to me, my love
Profess your love... give in to me, my love
Come to me, my love
give in to me, Sweetheart
The Prince has fallen in love with the Princess...
Sameer, I'Ve been thinking.
- What?
You can play the guitar, paint, sing... you're quite a multi-talented man.
- Guess why?
That's because I'm me.
Not you!
having a ball, aren't you?
- You have a great talent too
What?
- You tell lies to fool people!
Listen, make a portrait for me too
Don't mind, but I paint only beautiful people!
Know what?
- What, what?
I'm in a great mood today.
Say what you want to
You aren't as innocent as you appear to be
Why?
How you brought Rani around in just two hours last night
Weren't you jealous!
As close as you get to her, I want to get closer to her too
Aren't you jealous?
Aren't you?
What's your problem?
My problem is that I want to score with my friend's girlfriends... it makes me Very happy!
When I get married, I want you to paint me and my wife together
You know, with her at my side.
And I lying down in her lap
She in black-and-white, I in colour...
Sure, I will
Whom are you marrying?
Bijli?
No, it's Rani
Aren't you jealous?
Aren't you?
See?
Your temper hurts you yourself, doesn't it?
If it wasn't for the oath, I'd have squeezed him out like the tube!
Where's Sameer?
- The brush!
Get to be the master's disciple!
Quick!
Life's a dream...
Who?
Rani, you?
You can even paint!
- Well, I...
My painting?
How sweet!
Tears and desires, that's how it is
You're quite a revelation, Sunny.
- No revelation
Painting, singing, the guitar...
No wonder they call you multi-talented
Sameer's multi-talented too
You ought to have seen him at the party last night
The way he sang and danced...
I'Ve been teaching him classical dancing and he's into rock?
Anyway, fresh orange juice for the two of you.
Where's he?
He's in the latrine right now
He'll take some time.
You can wait.
- No thank you
give him some and you have some too.
Happy New Year
Was Rani here?
- Yes, she was
You'll now ask me if even my father has even done any painting
And I'll say, my Papa's a Very big businessman in Indore
You'll say, Liar, dog...
- That you really are
Your dream of making Rani fall in love with you will remain a pipe dream
It won't be a pipe dream.
Because I know what your weakness is
Really?
What is it?
You can never tell Rani that you love her
So listen!
I swear it on my grandma!
I will profess my love to Rani in the presence of the whole world today!
And I swear it on my father in Indore too
I'm the one who'll bring Rani to this house, as a bride
If my love is true, I'll be the one who'll marry Rani
And if I'm determined enough, I'll lead her here by the hand
For me.
You are Rani's brother
No brother.
I'm her lover
Rani, you think this loVer-boy is an accomplished singer and painter
I'll expose him to you today
C'mon, sweetheart, let's go
This juice Rani brought for you I'll have it
Hold it!
Who did she bring it for?
- For you
So I'll drink it!
Share it with me!
I can't share anything of Rani's!
May you find it bitter!
I find everything of Rani's to be sweet
At least let out a burp!
I'll paint a picture and also sing a song... and expose Sunny.
Okay?
What new ailment is this?
One Duggal is difficult to tolerate
Three, five?
More than I can endure!
Where do you think you're going?
Stop there!
Lie down here, Rani.
I'll put them to bed and return
C'mon!
Eagle!
I'm going to make you a seagull!
Senior!
Swat this fly!
You'Ve made a mistake by messing with the Eagle Gang!
One Sunny I can't tolerate.
And six of them walk up to me!
I'm going to thrash all six of them!
C'mon!
Tommy!
Come here!
Come!
You always bark at me, don't you?
So bark now... bark!
The next time you bark, you're going to disappear.
You get that?
Take care of your kids and your dogs!
I'll spare you this time.
Next time, you're gone
Tommy, my son, don't keep going outside
There are bad people in the locality
have I ever raised my Voice with you?
have I?
And how Sameer was yelling at you yesterday!
The insolent chap!
Go and play in the house, son.
And don't go out... my good son!
Tommy!
Tommy...
Tommy, where have you gone?
You ought to have considered what would happen to me without you!
Darling, we too are sad that Tommy's gone missing
But how long will you keep starving, thinking about him?
Let's eat, Papa.
I'm hungry too
No, my child.
I don't feel like it
Colonel...
I'Ve looked everywhere in Goa, but there's no trace of Tommy
I don't know where he has gone.
Could someone have kidnapped him?
But who could be Tommy's enemy?
Mr Duggal!
That's it
No... he hasn't been around since yesterday
Sameer?
- Why Sameer?
No, can't be Sameer.
But he could do a thing like this too.
Remember his public threat?
That he'd make the dog disappear!
If the dog barks, I'll kill him, I'll finish him!
No way, he was drunk.
- Really?
But who then?
He's the culprit!
Who is it?
That scoundrel has broken me in every part of my body!
I don't know what revenge he is extracting from me... by having Tommy separated from me!
Sameer!
Where are you hiding, you thief?
This is a warning!
If you don't return Tommy to me in 24 hours...
I'll have you sent to jail!
I still hold sway among the cops.
I'm not sparing you!
What does that mean?
- He has influence
give him the dog!
May the worms get you!
What new fuss is this?
have your father treated
Why'd I haVe my brother-in-law kidnapped anyway?
Why?
Where am I going to look for this dog now?
You have a Variety of dogs
- Hush!
Don't call them dogs.
They take offense
I'Ve brought them up like my own children
That's Rustom, that's Sohrab.
Eats less, snarls all the time
That's Cyrus.
Faithful.
But eats and enjoys a good life
And that is...
This is the dog I want.
Do you have it?
I do have it!
That's my boy, Tin Tin!
Say hello!
Quite a good boy.
But once he loses his temper... he's going to bite.
And remember... don't ever give him a cold bath
But this one doesn't have a black spot.
- Don't worry!
Here's the solution!
Mr Colonel...
look who's here
Tommy!
My son!
Where had you gone away to?
Where did you find him, Sameer?
- The poor chap... was sitting by a lamp-post, shivering.
He used to always bark at me
But this time, he said, Papa...
and went for my feet
He appeared to be telling me, Please take me to my Papa
Papa?
- You
Oh yes!
He's like my son, of course!
Papa, it's because of Sameer that we have Tommy back today
You must forgive him at least now.
- Sure, I forgive him!
Rama, lay the table
What's happening here?
Look at this, Sunny!
Tommy's back today because of Sameer
Look me in the eye, my brother!
Where did you find the dog?
Where did you find it?
I went mad looking for it!
For Rani's sake, look into my eyes!
Where did you find the dog?
Tell me!
Sunny, I don't know what's gotten into my Tommy
He's been behaving like a stranger ever since he has returned
He seems to have changed.
- He has stayed with the stray dogs
I know a cure!
Squeeze him in a bucket of cold water!
Squeeze him?
- I mean, give him a cold bath
Oh, I see.
All right
Please sit down.
- Won't you give Tommy a bath?
No!
I'll first give Tommy a bath.
I'll have breakfast later
The breakfast will get cold, papa.
- I'll be back soon, my child
Let's take a bath, Tommy boy!
- Where's Sameer?
Sunny, please call Sameer, will you?
- Not me, he sleeps till late
He'll hit me for no reason.
You go and call him instead
All right, I'll call him
We shall overcome...
Who is it?
Are you asleep, Sameer?
Wake up!
Sunny, don't change your Voice and bother me!
Let me sleep!
Rani?
One second.
I'll be out there
Who are you?
Who on earth are you?
- Bijli
But who?
- It's Rani
One moment, Rani.
I'm coming!
What are you doing here?
What?
- What are you doing here?
I was sleeping with you
I came to call you for breakfast
I'Ve said nothing!
I'll join you in two seconds!
Go away!
- Where?
Want me to come?
- Go away!
give that to me?
- What?
That one.
- What?
I'm coming inside
God!
I'm so sorry, Rani.
How disgusting!
What you think is wrong, Rani!
- How about what I see?
This one?
It's not mine.
It's hers!
I'Ve done nothing wrong, Rani.
Please try to understand...
You...
I'll fix you!
Rani...
That piece of thorn
I swear it on you, Rani!
I don't know that girl!
How could you with a girl you don't know?
I swear, I don't even know her!
- Without knowing them... will you call just about any girl?
- Listen to me, Rani...
You'Ve started getting girls into your bed now!
This is too much, Rani!
Listen to me!
Hey girl, can't you hear what boss is saying to you?
Do just as the boss says.
Okay?
Else the Eagle Gang will catch you and present you to the boss, okay?
What are you guys saying?
- Command us, boss!
No one dares oppose you!
Do what you want to.
Here on the streets!
Go for her!
Grab her!
Grab her?
- No, I won't
This was all that was left!
You're a loafer.
And a drunkard!
You're a womaniser!
Now you're leader of the Eagle gang!
I'm not the leader.
- Shame on you, Sameer!
Forget her, boss.
There's one better than the other in Goa
Point out a girl.
She'll be in your arms
After a nice cold bath...
Tommy will become a handsome boy
He'll be good looking.
Those dirty dogs in the lane?
Don't ever play with them, okay?
See how dirty you are
Good boy!
Good boy!
bravo...
What's this?
A black dye?
So this isn't my Tommy!
Hey... are you a wild dog?
Rama!
The dog has bitten me!
Rama!
It isn't our Tommy!
It's a duplicate of Tommy!
Sameer has given us a wild dog!
The black dye came off when I was giving it a bath!
Look!
I'm not sparing Sameer!
He's made the dog bite me!
God!
He acts like a butcher!
After beating him black and blue he's now setting the dogs after him!
He has no respect for his elders!
He'll need to take 14 injections in the stomach now
Go and take the first one.
- Go on...
Tiny injections they'll give him
Sameer, I'm Raj, the astrologer
Here you are!
And I'Ve been looking for you all over Goa
I'm looking for Sameer, too.
Let me know if you find him
I want to break his limbs!
- No... liquor isn't good for you!
- It's blessed wine
Look!
Rani and Sunny...
No!
It isn't Rani!
It's someone else
Really?
Very well
With you, I'll work wonders, O beautiful one
With you, I'll work wonders, O beautiful one
Let's rock to the music, O beautiful one
How shall you have me?
The whole world craves me
The sight of you has driven me out of my mind, O beautiful one
Watch the wonders this boy is going to work, O beautiful one
Come into my arms...
I'll show you the way to love
Take over my heart... you'll be my life itself
I'm at war with myself, my blouse is getting tighter... answer the questions that rise in my heart, beautiful one
Watch the wonders this boy is going to work, O beautiful one
I'm one crazy man... who's not in his senses
Feed it to my lips... all the Venom you possess
It's a trap laid by my beauty
It's beyond comparison
having found you, I shall overcome, my love
Watch the wonders this boy is going to work, O beautiful one
With you, I could work wonders, O beautiful one
Let's rock to the music, O beautiful one
How shall you have me?
The whole world coVets me
The sight of you drives me out of my senses, O beautiful one
Watch the wonders this boy is going to work, O beautiful one
Stop it, stop it...
Rickety old rickshaw!
- That'll be 40 rupees, ma'am
Here you are.
- But this is 20 Rupees
every senior citizen gets a discount of 50 per cent
Whether it's the bus or a railway train
Besides, yours is a rickety old rickshaw!
Grandma!
Grandma is here!
Look at this kid!
He's calling me a grandma!
Sameer...
- Grandma, don't call Sameer
He's a bad boy!
- Why?
He ran away with my chocolate yesterday
And today, I will run away with your glasses!
give my glasses to me!
- I'm running away... come after me!
My glasses...
- What's happening here?
Make this old fossil see reason, please
But he's my husband.
- What!
No, I'm her son!
- Son?
She's my Mummy!
Mummy, ask grandma to get me a chocolate!
My darling son, give my glasses to me
On one condition.
- What?
We'll play Cricket with it.
- I can't see anything!
I'll toss it up like a ball.
You must catch it
everyone in Rani's family hates me.
That includes her dog, Tommy
Grandma, that's your grandson's love story then
Now you tell me what I am to do.
- My son... why must you worry?
Now that I haVe arrived, everything will be all right
Just show me the girl once.
I'll go and talk it over with her, okay?
Come, I'll show you.
- My son!
That's Rani, grandma
Where, son?
- over there, grandma
She's right there
Yes, yes...
- Isn't she beautiful?
Absolutely beautiful!
But I can't see a thing!
You go to the office and get on with your work, my son
I'll go to her house and talk it over, okay?
Okay, grandma.
- Bye, son
My child...
- I'm here, ma'am
What spell have you cast on Sameer?
- What?
He's madly in love with you!
You're the only one he talks about, in everything he does
What are you talking about?
You know the Colonel...
My child, I know the Colonel is Very angry with Sameer
Once you agree to the wedding... the Colonel will have to get out of your way!
My child, do not be afraid.
If you're in love with Sameer... not the Colonel and not any power in the world can separate you both!
Sameer?
And Rama?
My grandson will give you the bliss the Colonel never could
If you're afraid of the Colonel, I'll help the two of you elope!
Sameer hasn't come yet.
I wonder what's up
He'll come, grandma
Here he is.
- Grandma...
have you talked it over, grandma?
- Oh yes, son.
I haVe
Very good.
Has Rani agreed?
- Yes, Rani has agreed
You now need to talk to her mother and she'll bring the Colonel around
Make an eleven rupee offering.
And that'll be it!
Grandma!
That's water!
The coffee's in this one here!
ever since my glasses have broken I can't see a single thing, my son
Grandma, how could you have spoken to Rani then?
One uses his mouth to speak, my son.
Not one's eyes
You must'Ve chosen right.
- Sure
How many fingers, grandma?
- Four
Three... two...
- Grandma!
I'm not totally blind yet, son.
I can still see a bit
And why must you worry?
Go and talk it over with Rani's mother
Sameer!
Let me have your glasses fixed, ma'am
In just a little while, we'll reach your in-laws' house
And here we are!
Praise the Colonel!
- What are you doing?
Holy water from St. Peter's church.
Go on.
Neither is the old man there nor is your future wife.
Go and talk it over with your future mother-in-law!
Will she listen to me?
- Of course
Just latch the door from inside!
- Why?
Neither will she go out, nor will she send you out
Once the matter is settled, unlatch the door.
Very simple
Go on.
I'm right here!
Sameer... why are you latching the door?
So that you don't send me out of the house... nor leave the house yourself
Was this the time for this angel of death to return?
What you're doing is wrong, Sameer
Is falling in love wrong?
I ask you... have you never been in love?
- Well, I...
You have, haVen't you?
So why all the restrictions in my love?
Now look, Sameer.
You...
Sameer!
Where's Sameer?
He's in there, with your wife
- What?
You can't go inside till Sameer's work is over
Till Sameer's work is done?
give me an opportunity.
I haVe so much to give in love!
I beg you, Sameer.
Please go away
No.
Unless you agree, I can't go away lt'll take only two minutes.
Let him do it, Colonel!
I'll see what he's upto!
Colonel!
Why're you so scared even after grandma has spoken to you?
The Colonel used to be a colonel.
And you are the colonel of this family
If you say yes, what can the colonel do about it?
For God's sake, leave my sari alone!
Let them get on with it!
If the youngsters run away, who'll lose face?
Who'll get a bad name?
- Get lost!
Your sari's stuck
Don't worry.
I'll have it freed
Look at the evil man!
What's on your mind, my child?
Like you folks think
Nothing happened...
Sameer didn't misbehaVe with me
I thought Very hard over it
What I feel is... he had come to talk about you
He's madly in love with you.
What about you?
Is it Sameer?
Or Sunny?
I don't understand, Mama
Sunny is a nice guy
I like Sameer too.
But Papa hates him
I'm in a dilemma.
- Look, my child... don't worry about mine and your father's likes
Decide for yourself
I'm finding it difficult to decide
What you got to gauge is, who loves you the most...
Sameer, or Sunny
And if you are still confused, leave it to God
My red Veil... flutters in the flowing wind
And my beloved casts glances at me... on the sly
I know he will love me... but he'll make my life miserable
Red Veil... your red Veil... flutters in the flowing wind
Your red Veil flutters in the flowing wind
And your beloved casts glances at you... on the sly
I'll give you my heart...
I'll even die for you
For all my efforts to hide my pretty face... it hardly took time for the cruel breeze... to break my resolve
Your moon-like face has cast a spell all around
The sight of you... puts even the moon to shame
I'm coy.
- Goodness me
I'm apprehensive.
- Goodness me
Come into my arms, let not this opportunity go wasted
Your beloved has already seen you... on the sly, though
I'll give you my heart...
I'll even die for you
I know he will love me... but he'll make life miserable for me
This fragrant ambience... invites us to make love
My pretty love... give in to your beloved
The fragrance of your love... has merged into my breath
Here, my love, I give up everything...
I give in to you
You are desirous...
- Goodness me you admit.
- Goodness me
No stopping me now...
I'm unstoppable
My beloved has seen me... on the sly
I know he will love me... but he'll make life miserable for me
I'll give you my heart...
I'll even die for you
My red Veil... flutters in the flowing wind
Your red Veil... flutters in the flowing wind
And your beloved casts glances at you... on the sly, though
I know he will love me... but he'll make my life miserable
I'll give you my heart...
I'll even die for you
My son, you came here in quest of peace
Where will you go now?
- I'll go to a place... where there are no people at all.
The Andaman-Nicobar islands
You'll clash with a guy even if he's the only one around in town
Do what you will, but you can't change your destiny
I know how much you love Rani, my son
Will you leave her also and go away?
I'm not happy to leave
I haVe to go away.
That's how the situation is
Let's go, grandma.
It's time the boat sailed
Look after yourself.
- Sameer... well, well!
The priest, if not Rani, what say?
What's up?
- I'm leaving
Hey!
You can't leave me and go away
Not you alone.
I'm leaving this world behind
You'Ve only seen Rani and me getting together
Won't you stay for the wedding?
Guess who played the biggest role in bringing Rani and me together?
He kept making mistakes and she kept getting closer to me
Oh yes, that's a solid idea you gave me!
Of publicly proposing to Rani!
Incidentally, India and Pakistan are playing a cricket match today
I'Ve invited her father.
Rani will be there too
I'm thinking of saying it to her in public!
Rani, will you marry me?
You're lucky... because I'Ve stopped dreaming about Rani
Enjoy yourself
Fights, brawls, show of temper... and proposing to girls are things real men do
I'd rather you play the guitar, Sameer
Today's match is going to be a terrific affair... because, for the first time, we have the Indian and Pakistani teams... playing a friendly match in this stadium in Goa today
Paa-ji's here!
Get out of the way!
Where do you think you're going?
Get out!
Who's that in the stadium?
He's grabbed the mike from Pa-ji
I'll...
Rani!
Where are you?
He's come here, looking for Rani!
Who's Rani?
What's he shouting Rani for?
Who's she?
It has to do with the heart.
Keep it up, brave lad!
Go for her!
Looks like it has to do with love
Rani...
listen to me...
Where're you hiding, sis-in-law?
The boss is so upset!
He'll find her.
He sure will.
- Sis-in-law!
Rani... where are you?
You mess with my mike?
You fight with me?
Rani!
All I'll say is that you mustn't marry Sunny!
He's not worthy of you!
It's a question of your life!
Hold it, hold it... he has something to say.
Looks like it has to do with love
Here you are
Rani, I'm not the sort of guy you think I am
Yes, I made the mistake of keeping my temper under control
Else, I'd have beaten Sunny black and blue and throw him out of Goa
But Sunny's done a wonderful thing today
He has stopped me from going away
There's something I want to say to you, Rani
Rani...
I loVe you
I haVe loved you ever since I first set eyes on you
Since the day the Colonel started hating me
Colonel...
I'Ve made a lot of mistakes.
Please forgive me
Rani, if you're not in love with me... it's cool.
I'll go away
But I haVe a feeling that you do
That you do love me
And thus, I publicly...
He's Very upset!
I'm not asking for too much.
I only want you to marry me... so that we can have a family.
We can have kids... who take after you in looks; eyes, nose, lips, cheeks et al
I only want them to have my surname... because my dad had the surname Malhotra
All I want to say to you is...
Ask her, Will you marry me?
- I'll marry you, if she doesn't!
Rani... will you marry me?
Louder!
Will you marry me?
Can't hear you!
Rani!
Will you marry me?
Will you marry me?
Say yes, sister-in-law.
- Please say yes!
Rani, I think he's the right boy for you
He at least won't hit me after he's married to you
Say yes, girl!
Go on!
That's a spirited boy.
He's in love with you!
He's saying as much in public.
So say yes!
Let the birds fly!
Say yes, sister-in-law!
Go on, my child.
Go!
Our kids will take after you in eyes and smile
And I like the surname Malhotra
Could I haVe the mike, please?
As my mother used to say... anger is love's worst enemy
One who can't control his temper, can't control anything in his lifetime
Sameer, my mother says, anger is love's worst enemy
One who can't control his temper, can't control anything in his lifetime
Not your mother!
That's what my friend Arun's mother used to say!
You remember what your friend used to say
But you'Ve forgotten your friend?
You can't be Arun!
You're a scoundrel!
Arun was a gem of a guy!
Guess whose house I went to first, on my return from America... after 19 years?
Yours!
Sameer's not here.
Who are you?
- It's me!
Sameer's childhood friend.
Arun!
Good God!
Where's my buddy, grandma?
- He's away in Goa
Is he still as hot-tempered, or has he calmed down?
His temper has got worse with age, my son
Grandma then told me about your problem... how you had had a heart-break, how you had gone away to Goa... met Rani there and fallen in love with her... and how, for her sake, you had suppressed your anger
Okay then.
I'll go and phone Sameer
No, grandma.
You won't say a word to him
I'm going to treat him not as his friend, but as his adversary
That's how I landed in Goa... to stay with your house, in your room, with you!
I now know why you did this all the time, buddy boy!
C'mon!
The insolent!
- Go topless
Those with iron pajamas...
- have an ape for an Uncle!
Whose aunts are cats...
- have dogs for friends!
When it comes to the pickle...
- They hug, buddy!
The insolent!
- Go topless
Those with iron pajamas!
- have an ape for an Uncle!
Whose aunts are cats...
- have dogs for friends!
When it comes to the pickle...
- They hug, buddy!
What happened?
What's up now?
All over again!
What wrong have I done now?
- You're ill-fated, son
I'm jinxed!
But nothing can go wrong now
The poor chap's been suffering all this while
For your sake, he has remained a bachelor
You shall now become his bride... marry him
marry him
It seemed as if this chap was my tormentor
But he's the one who has shown me the right path
However, you are the one who shall become my bride
You must become his sister-in-law... you must marry me
five!
five!
Greetings, sire.
- May you be happy
Please take a look at my grandson's horoscope and predict his future
Certainly
Let me see your forehead
The lines on his forehead make it so obvious... that the fury of Jupiter, the Sun, Mars and Saturn will rule his life
They will dominate his life totally!
Should he be provoked by someone... this boy will certainly not spare him
What should we name him?
Sameer.
A gust of cool breeze.
- Sameer...?
By nature, he's hot-headed.
The name will keep him calm
Come to me, come...
Guess what?
Don't ever make the mistake of getting him married
There you are!
He has kicked me!
As he grows up, he'll use his fists and kicks more than his mouth!
I'm not sparing you!
I'm not sparing you!
never!
Sameer!
Let him go!
leave him alone!
C'mon, Sameer!
Come with me!
Sameer, why did you raise your hand at the Principal?
When I lose my temper... it feels as if a hundred guitars are playing in my brains!
Now tell me something.
Why did you hit Chintu?
I was angry because he abused you!
Sameer, my mother says, anger is love's worst enemy
One who can't control his temper, can't control anything in his lifetime
Now stop being angry and smile.
Smile!
So you won't smile...?
I'll set your mood right in a moment
The insolent!
- Go topless
Those with iron pajamas...
- have an ape for an Uncle!
Whose aunts are cats...
- have dogs for friends!
When it comes to the pickle...
- They hug, buddy!
Sameer gets into a fight with someone or the other every day... and today, he raised his hands on me!
The Principal!
So much of anger is not good, Ma'am.
It's Arun who always calms him down
He was born with the temper.
How will I explain...?
ever since his parents have died, his temper is getting worse and worse I understand, ma'am.
And that is why I'm not throwing him out of the school
But I'm really worried. lf this is how Sameer Malhotra's childhood is... how is his adolescence going to be?
So these three fractures and the 36 stitches... is it all your doing?
- Yes, sir. I'Ve thrashed them
But you must ask them why I hit them
There's this girl Sameer wants to marry... and these guys were treating her like a ball in the basket!
In 1998, you beat up a professor in the college?
He didn't have any time to teach the boys
But he used to call the girls home all alone and gave them tuitions
He had evil on his mind.
So I gave it to him!
What wrong did I do?
In the year 2000, you rescued a man who was drowning... and gave him a beating?
- l was the one who saved him too!
There was a board which said in bold letters, Swimming is forbidden
Why did he go there?
I gave it to him... what wrong did I do?
Look, we have received eight complaints..
..against you in the last five years
You might get more lf l receive another complaint, you're going straight to jail!
Roma...?
You'Ve got married?
Don't be angry today.
Please don't hit someone I'll...
- No, wait here
There's no saying when he might hit someone
You think I'll hit you?
Why?
How can I hit you?
I...
And I thought you...
Did you think I'd marry you?
- Yes
have you ever told me that you love me?
- No
And look at him.
He's so sweet, so gentle... he loves me so much.
And you...
Now listen to me.
No girl can ever fall in love with you
She can only be afraid of you.
- Why?
You have such a temper, even I'm afraid of you
Remember how you thrashed those boys at the basketball court, Sameer?
But they had made a mistake.
They had to be punished
every human being makes a mistake.
What if I had made a mistake?
You'd have hit me too, isn't it?
Isn't it true?
Let's go
Sameer, are you really going away?
- Yes, grandma I'Ve got the job of a lifeguard in Goa. lt's a nice job
Besides, I get into a lot of fights here, grandma lf l go to a new place and meet new people, I might not get into fights
My son, think again before you go
The reason behind the fights is your temper
Your temper will go with you wherever you go
Yes, brother. lf you leave, I'll be worried about you all the time
You're the one I'll worry about.
I'Ve got to get you educated and married I'Ve got to have an operation conducted on grandma's eyes... and send her to grandpa in heaven at the earliest I'm not going away in a hurry.
He'll have to wait!
But before you leave, you'll have to promise me... that you won't get into fights and brawls with anyone ls that clear, my son?
Grandma, I swear it on your head I'll never lose my temper again
One, two... is that your luggage, mister?
Also this bag?
Four...?
Four bags?
Yes
Which is THE bag?
I mean, the bag in which you're carrying the cash and Valuables...?
Terrible times, you see.
You could easily be robbed
Robberies are commonplace in trains nowadays
Difficult to tell the bonafide passenger from the thief!
Go to sleep. I'll stay awake.
- l'm not sleepy
Mister, this period between 3 and 5 in the morning... is meant to be spent in slumber.
however strong a man is... he does drift into it at least once I want to see when you go to sleep.
- l told you, I'm not sleepy
All right.
Actually, I loVe my forty winks I'm going to sleep
Yes, grandma, I'Ve reached safely.
Okay...
Thank you, mister.
- What for?
For looking after my luggage I'll explain. I haVe a weakness.
I can't stay awake in the night
And I can't sleep in the train, for fear of losing my luggage... and that is why, I pulled off the fast one
So that I could go to sleep and you'd look after my luggage.
Nice idea, eh?
Know what ?
You're a great guy I think I must travel with you on my way back too
Here's my card.
Phone me on this number, I'll find you at the station
Help me, grandma!
Praise the Lord...
Lord, protect my grandson wherever he is
Lord, help Sameer find his love
Lord!
You...?
- Yes. I'm Raj.
He's Paul
Our misfortune, we're brothers.
Twins I'm an astrologer who predicts people's future from their birthcharts... and he ruins their future!
What does your brother do?
- He belongs to the Eagle gang...
Very dangerous people.
never cross their path
never.
- You appear to be a stranger in town
Whom are you Visiting?
- Mr Duggal
Mr Duggal!
- Yes, he has a Vacant room
Not just a room, his brains are empty too
He used to be a police inspector in Goa... and has blood clotted in his head ever since..
..a thief struck him with a stick
wherever the clot stands, that part becomes useless
He plays deaf, dumb and blind
Let's see what he's playing today
He's playing blind today I don't believe this!
- You will, Very soon
That's Mr Duggal!
But he's looking at me.
- No, you're looking at him
Let me show you.
Wait
Rascals!
You hit me because I'm blind today?
When I start seeing again, none of you will be seen around here again!
Do you believe it now?
Wait a moment I'm glad you're here.
I haVen't had any tea
give me half a litre of milk ls the milk over, Bansi?
I'm not Bansi. I'm Sameer .
I'm sorry, I thought you were the milkman
When did the headlights go off?
How does that concern you?
You're not a doctor, are you?
give me the milk.
- But I'm not a milkman... I'm Raj, the astrologer!
- The astrologer!
Such a big mouth!
- lt's not my mouth. lt's a bag
And here is your mouth!
- Let me be, please!
What brings you here...?
- l'm the one who came here I'Ve landed a job at the beach resort.
Mr Sharma has had a word with you
For the room, isn't it?
Come, I'll take you to your room I'll show you to your room
Go upstairs from here.
Your room is right ahead.
Go on
There's no room there!
- No?
But I saw it last night.
Did it disappear overnight?
Hello.
- You're showing him the wrong place
The room is over there!
- Where?
Here!
Come with me.
- You're throwing me out...?
We're actually going in!
I'll check out the room later.
Let's talk about the rent first I can pay you 2500 at the most.
- l'll collect at least 5000 rupees!
It's okay if you agree.
Or you may leave...
Hey!
It's me!
- Why do you keep butting in?
give him half the room for 2500.
Find another tenant for the other half ls Bansi staying with you too?
- But I'm not Bansi!
Don't be angry.
give me half a litre of milk
But I'm not the milkman!
I'm Raj... the astrologer!
So what are you doing here?
Go and look up people's horoscopes
Show Sameer the room.
Come, Sameer... lt's me!
Where's Sameer?
- Here I am, sir
C'mon
For my grandma's eyesight
For my sister's education
For my sister's marriage
Lord, it's Your responsibility to have an operation..
..conducted on grandma's eyes
My sister's education and her marriage is also Your responsibility
Fill up the coffers at the earliest, please
And okay, it's my responsibility to make offerings to You at the temple
O beautiful one...
Come to me
Has Mr Duggal asked you to come and go through the balcony, brother?
No.
- Not your mistake, though
whoever stays in that house, does take a fall in his lifetime lt's because of the sight ahead.
- You're right
And I wish you keep doing this to me every day I feel so nice today!
You...?
Already here to pick me up?
I told you to call up and come
No, I can't go with you so early.
Okay, do something
Look around Goa for a couple of days, then we'll leave together
Who is he?
- Our new manager
He'll kill me!
You sent for me, sir?
Are you Suraj?
- No
Suraj Prakash.
- Time for you to set, Suraj (Sun)
You won't ever rise in the morning again ln your 14 years of service, you were never in the night shift
From now on you will work in the night for a month
Sir, I'll die.
- Two months I'll be ruined, sir.
- Three months
And listen...
- Yes sir?
Sleep is man's worst weakness
And the time between 3 and 5 is the most Vulnerable one lf l see your shoulders droop at that time, you are off the roster I get it
Mr Sameer
When did you get this motorbike?
- My company gave it to me today
No, you got it yesterday.
- Today
You're talking about the motorbike, I'm talking about your eyes
You clapped your eyes on Rani yesterday, right?
Rani?
Who?
I'm watching the kids play
Really?
I'm a gifted astrologer I'Ve seen your horoscope.
Let me introduce you to Rani
Else, you will keep falling off your window I'm a priest of love.
Because of us priests, two hearts meet... a family is made, new babies are born..
... there's no greater joy than this
Her father, the colonel, is a strict man, I hear
He's retired.
He may be pulled up any time
He won't find a better son-in-law.
- never
He's going to embrace you in the first meeting itself
Bye ls Ms Rani cross with you?
- No
Then why is she going that way?
Yes, priest?
- Please come here
She's coming
Once you guys shake hands..
..it won't take much time for your hearts to meet
Come...
Be prepared
HaVen't seen the colonel for days.
- Our car's in the garage
He's gone to pick it up.
- lll-fated carburetor, I told him
He must at least fill gas worth 1 25..
..but he won't spend more than 25 bucks
Anyway... this is my childhood friend Sameer
Not that we met in childhood...
the two of us met as adults
She's Rani
Sameer is a lifeguard, and Rani is a fashion designer
Won't you shake hands?
Can't you take care of your kid?
What happened?
- A flat tyre?
No, someone got smacked
Who?
- Daddy!
What an introduction!
Who slapped him?
It sounded like an explosion
Are you all right, Papa?
- Don't ask me, dear lt feels as if someone hammered a hot nail into my ear
You shouldn't have hit him so hard.
This boy is naughty
Thank God the colonel applied the brakes in time and saved him
Are you in your senses?
How dare you hit my Papa?
I didn't know he was your father.
And that kid...
What kid?
Her mother is here, there are so many people around... but they didn't utter a word!
You wanted to be a hero, eh?
Stop fighting and take him to a doctor, quick
Conductor?
I need a doctor, dammit!
- That's where we're going
He's gone deaf!
What have you done?
You were to ask Rani's hand from him and you just handed it out to him
Who is Rani, sir?
You?
Are you working day and night?
No sir. I just came to request you
Please be kind enough and turn my bad nights into good nights, sir
What for?
- Because after office hours... when I go home and shut the doors and windows to catch a wink... the kids around assemble outside my house and scream together...
The matinee show begins now
And my wife takes it out on the kids saying, No shows of late
Sir, my honour is at stake
All right.
give me some time to think
Really?
How much time?
- Say, a month or two
What?
- When will my duty hours change?
Three months after that
Who is this Rani, sir?
Youth is short
The rest of life is no good
Once... once it's gone... youth never returns
What do you... think about me?
Don't take me for a foe
Be my friend
Lay off.
Let me go
Don't harass me
Sweetheart, so much... of attitude is bad
Youth is short
The rest of life is no good
My love, enjoy... every moment
What you have, is in the present
Tomorrow never comes I think you are crazy
You and I don't sail in the same boat I can't just... stop following you
Youth is short
The rest of life is no good
Once... once it's gone... youth never returns
Thank God you're here.
I was really worried
What for?
Aren't we friends now?
Yeah, but your father hasn't forgiven me yet
When things go wrong in the beginning, it all falls in place in the end I don't get it.
Please explain I mean, I'Ve brought Papa around and he has called you over for dinner
Really?
Look, he's an army officer who is Very punctual
You will be there at nine sharp I'll be there at eight.
- No way.
Neither early, nor late
You look Very happy.
Tommy's sister says, see you at home... as if you're going home to become Tommy's brother-in-law
But to impress Tommy's father, don't forget to buy champagne for him
And, you must uncork it at one go!
is it Sameer?
- Yes, sir
Come on in.
- Actually sir, I'Ve come to apologise I committed a mistake the other day.
Please forgive me I'Ve forgiven you, that is why you are standing before me
lovely dog
He's Tommy, not a dog
He's like my son.
Remember
Sit
I'm from Patiala, Punjab.
- Really?
My uncle was in the army
Once I took his gun and ran to the fields, for some shooting practice
Enraged, he snatched the gun... and said, lt's an official gun I was so peeved that I joined the army... and I got my own gun
A few years later, war for independence broke out in Goa
They posted me here in Goa
After the war, I settled here with my family
Luckily, I loVe Goa
Luckily, I loVe Goa too
What do they call a chicken in Punjab?
- Kukdi
And a girl?
- Kudi
Those medals... did you win them, sir?
My wife wasn't in the army, so obviously they belong to me
Actually sir, your personality unsettles me
That's why I'm talking like a fool
never mind
And that Chinese pot near the medals... looks like an antique piece, does it contain Chinese tea?
It contains my late mother's ashes
It gives me a feeling that I always have her blessings with me
You dearly loved your mother.
- l still love her
We tried really hard to save her
But what God wills...
- Let it be, Papa
Let's eat
Why did you have to bring that, son?
It's my first time here.
- Let me uncork it
No, sir.
Let me have the pleasure
And to you, beautiful lady
What have you done?
What have you done?
Shut up!
It all happened because of you
Because of me, really?
- You asked me to uncork it at one go I asked you to open the bottle, not to break the pot of ashes
Good that the pot broke.
At least it has set his mother's soul free
I think the colonel is insane
Oh no... he's a Very intelligent man lntelligent, my foot!
Mother's ashes ought to be immersed in the Ganges
No one keeps it at home.
never in a pot, at that!
It's okay, we'll talk later.
- Let me clear this now
Please try to see it from my point of View
Why don't you try to see it from my point of View?
have you seen the colonel?
He looks as if he grew old twenty years back
Look at his wife... as if she has just stepped into youth
Tell me, from what angle does Rani look like the colonel's daughter?
Yeah, Tommy does appear to be his son I can't explain that.
You should be asking the person concerned
Who?
- Rani
The colonel would never reveal the secret to Rani
The other day I spared you because it was only a mistake
But today, you intentionally...
You hit my Papa on his face... still I forgave you.
But today you'Ve hurt me in the heart
Can you explain?
- Rani...
Did you intend to say that my father didn't sire me?
No!
- That my mother is wanton?
No!
It was tough convincing myself that you are a nice person
And you, priest!
I'm really surprised
How could you consider such a lowly man a friend?
Let alone respect someone, he hardly knows what respect means
See?
She is hurt because of you!
- Because of me, really?
I was only kidding.
When you knew Rani was standing behind me... why didn't you tell me?
- l was telling you... see from my point of View!
- Your language is too tough for me
For all the mistakes you commit, you pass the buck on to me!
God!
Ball?
What happened?
- A flat tyre?
No, someone got thrashed
Who?
- Papa!
Granny!
I'm ill-fated, it's writ.
Reading my horoscope won't turn things around
Just checking what's worse is in store.
- What...?
Your past was your golden period.
- Golden period, really?
Yes.
Your future is worse.
- Worse than what I'm going through?
Jupiter's place is right up here.
Yours is down in hell
The Moon's place is in the 7th house.
Yours is homeless
moreover, Saturn is about to enter
You said, Saturn left me last week.
- And it did
Usually, once it leaves, Saturn never returns for another seven years
Not in your case.
Saturn is about to re-enter in a few seconds time
Right, anything is possible with me.
- Saturn is on its way
And it will wreck me.
- This Saturn is going to... change your life and destiny.
It will come like a tempest
What say, dude?
He's going to steal the princess away
As per my calculations, it will stay with you in your room... and knock at Rani's door
Hello uncle
Hello, I say.
Remember me?
I'm your distant relative.
Sunny
For miles away, uncle has no relatives.
Go away
Uncle, your servant is ill-mannered.
Ask him not to mess with me
Why is he so quiet?
- Not that he is glad to remain quiet
He's ailing.
- Shut up
Uncle, I'm Sunny.
Mr Khurana's son
Who...
Khur... ana?
Who Khurana?
- Back in Gurudaspur... this road in front of your house...
- There's one..
..in front of every house it turns around the corner.
- They all turn.
No road is straight
And where does it go?
Straight to his friend's house
Friend?
Who?
- Mr Khosla
He just said Khurana!
- How smart!
You caught me I was only testing you.
Know what?
When I asked your address... everyone said there's only one decent and honest boy in Goa.
You
Boy...?
What a fraud!
Tell me honestly, why are you here?
- Well, I... want to hire a room
No, he says.
Go away
No way, get lost, he says.
Look, he's pissed off
Now tell me.
- Stay here
Well, now that you are dumb, you won't pick up a fight
So let's go to my relative's place.
- relative, aunt?
Then who am I?
Who are you?
- Sunny
Not Sunny, he's Shani (Saturn).
- Shut up, dude
Uncle, for my sake don't tell aunt where l come from
Well, uncle himself doesn't know where he comes from
Aunt, I'm a tenant here.
Here's 10,000 bucks
Take another 9,999... take care I'm a bit tired.
Show me to my room, please
Let me see you off at the next street.
- Ass!
..
..Hold this.
Bring it upstairs
Oldie's got a nice room.
- Yes
But we are sharing it
What are you staring at me for?
- Why share?
We'll be exchanging beds
We'll also sleep in the same bed, as brothers...
Don't touch me. I don't like it
Like the rent, we share the room too.
This side is yours, that's mine
All right, give me a hug.
- No!
I don't hug men.
- Really?
How Vain
whatever.
- Okay listen... why don't you take your God there?
- God doesn't belong to one person
God belongs to everyone.
And listen, we'Ve shared the room... not the walls.
God's not moving.
- And where do I stick my posters?
wherever you wish.
God's not moving I got an idea.
Stick them up in the bathroom
Why do you get so angry?
- Am I angry?
Now!
even while you are talking.
- Yeah, where am I angry?
Look, the room's got hot.
Need to open the window
Don't open the window!
Why?
- She comes there I need to check her out then.
Since I pay half the rent... I'll open half the window
You're on my half, let me embrace you!
- Don't piss me off!
I tried my best to keep him off
What a sight!
Mr Sameer deliberately kept the door shut to keep me off
But smelling a scent from a distance is my forte
What a dish!
- Don't you say that!
Does she mean anything to you?
- No.
But decent folks stay here
By the way she is a nice and decent girl
And she's a colonel's daughter.
He will shoot you if he hears you
For a beauty like her, I'd take a bullet on my chest
On my chest idiotic!
Don't you jump!
- Why not?
You are in bad times, as it is
For all your good intentions, you might fall on top of the colonel
He's going in.
- No.
As per my calculations...
Tommy will have a go at him
He's gone inside.
- Not to worry.
My calculations say... the colonel will kick him out in a minute
What's your name?
- Tommy
Nice name.
My respects, uncle
Who are you?
What do you want?
- l just wanted to meet you, uncle I'm new here. I'm told that you are the only..
..decent and honest boy around
Boy?
- What else?
Look at you
You can put any young man to shame.
Besides... hang on.
What's that in your ears?
And what's around your neck, bro?
Don't ask me.
My blood boils when I think of it
Screwed my calculations!
What are you doing?
- Worry not. I haVe fixed many bones
And it's only a sprain.
Look straight... here goes
What say?
How do you feel?
Be honest.
- Feels nice
Where are you staying?
- At your neighbour Mr Duggal's place
The one who broke my neck also stays there
Don't be angry. I'm his roommate.
I know he's ill-mannered... and he'll surely change, but this is not how one should treat an elder
A ball hit me, by mistake
Darling, what's happening?
When did you employ a masseur?
From today.
- Oh no, he's not a masseur, darling
Sunny is a nice boy
He's Mr Duggal's tenant.
- l see
Tell you something, massage is not actually done indoors
A garden, or an open terrace would be just amazing
We have a terrace garden.
- Don't tell me.
Really?
Where?
Upstairs.
- Can I check it out?
Sure
Did he swallow something?
He's dancing ... advancing towards the girl
Damn... your loVe-story began here and ended in the colonel's ears
He began it by shaking hands, and it's going to end in honeymoon
Sir, do something.
Please do something to me
What do I do to you?
- l want a baby
give me a baby, please!
- What...?
What are you doing here?
- You!
What are you doing here?
You know her?
- She is my wife
Don't you have children?
- Yes, two in fact
Boys, both.
And you know what these boys are like I want a daughter.
- So why me?
Ask him
Listen... please
What?
- He promised to give me a daughter
After duty hours, he used to get me sweets and flowers... and shut the doors and windows
But ever since you put him on the night shift... the doors and windows only shut to allow him get a good day's sleep lt's a mistake but a mistake is a mistake
You must also have committed a mistake, by mistake, no?
Yes, you are right
And I can understand your problem.
I'll definitely help you
Hang on
From tomorrow, you will buy her sweets and flowers every day
What the...?
Get up
Was I wrong?
500 for grandma, 500 for my sister's studies... 500 for her marriage, and 500...
For my roommate
What a sight!
It's worth paying a hundred thousand in rent
What are you upto?
- Watching the colonel
Really?
- Wanna check?
That's his daughter
Do they look alike?
No way!
And what are you drinking?
Water.
- Really?
I swear by you.
- l see.
Go on
Let me smell it... is this water?
Fenny is Goa's speciality. lt's nothing but cashewnut juice I see. I'll juice you!
I'm going to tell Mr Duggal that you are boozing here
Listen...
Don't touch me.
- l won't booze anymore, promise
All right.
- One last swig
What's that?
- Oh, those?
Your God's on my wall, so I glued my goddesses to your wall
So why get angry?
- l'm not angry
You are peeved.
- l'm not
Relax... easy
You feel like abusing me.
- Not at all I know, you want to tell me something.
- No
You want to hit me.
Go on, hit me.
- No
C'mon, hit me.
- Oh no
Why don't you go to your half?
- Okay.
Peace
Peace
What was that?
Earthquake?
Mr Duggal, where did you pick that roommate from?
He boozes, and... watches Rani through his binoculars, You must go and inform the colonel
Oh, why would you inform the colonel?
The ass has stuffed you with money
Rather I'll go and inform him
Mr Duggal...
looks like he's deaf today
He's deaf
Young man, my neck feels better now
Hello aunt.
- Do something to my ear
Let me fix your neck first.
Fixing the ear is no big deal lt will be all right.
Where's Rani?
See, Rama?
Though they share the same room, they are poles apart
That swine injures me, and the other... the decent one, comes home everyday to give me a massage
Hush, Tommy
Sameer is not around, then who is Tommy barking at?
Dogs have a Very sharp memory, uncle
Tommy must be barking at Sameer's thoughts
Where's Rani?
Bloody dog!
Guess what?
You look so happy.
What gives?
- This year, the All India...
Fashion Designers' competition is going to be held in Goa
The designs I had sent have been approved
And I'm participating this year!
Papa, I got to pay the entry fees within two days.
Only 20,000 Rupees
Let her have it. I'll return every cent after marriage 20,000?
No dear, I can't afford that much
Please Papa, for my sake. lt's Very important for my career
Golden opportunities don't knock twice.
give her the money
Where's the money, son?
I'm a retired colonel
We manage with my pension.
Where do I get 20,000 from?
Selfish father
You upset her
Expenses have already risen this month. 1 2,000 for the hearing aid 3000 for my neck-collar.
Where do I get 20,000 from?
Why won't you give her?
You still have your eyes... heart, lungs and kidneys intact.
I'll puncture them all
Granny you ask me not to lose my temper!
Tell me, why not?
The colonel won't give Rani the money.
Who will help the poor girl?
I wish I could strangle his...
Granny, I got a solid idea
Postpone your eye surgery.
Let's first help..
..Rani realise her dream.
What say?
Besides, granny, Lord Krishna's birthday is approaching
The Lord is here!
Be careful with your pots, lassies...
So much!
Let it go!
That's not a biscuit
Bloody dog!
Let it go
What's that?
Dearest Rani, I know you want to become a famous fashion designer I'm sending you money... to help you cross the first hurdle in the path of your progress
Not a favour, just consider it as a gift from a friend
And, if you win the show... you will be happy, but my happiness will be greater than yours I expect nothing in return for this small help.
Not even thanks
Your well-wisher
How long will you conceal your youth, my love?
How long will you torment the bachelors?
Someday you are going to become someone's bride
Will you marry me?
Will you marry me?
I'll buy you earrings and bangles... I'll buy you everything, I swear
I'll steal the Moon, I'll even pluck the stars... I'll make the Sun bow before you, I swear
Someday you will go crazy for me
Will you marry me?
Will you marry me?
The day I come as a bridegroom, I won't go back... I'll take you away in a palanquin, I swear
I'll steal you away, before everyone I'll make you my bride, I swear
How long will you show indifference, my love?
Will you marry me?
Will you marry me?
How long will you conceal your youth, my love?
How long will you torment the bachelors?
Someday you are going to become someone's bride
Will you marry me?
Will you marry me?
I will marry you I will marry you
You never told me you play the guitar so well
What a revelation!
All those lessons in guitar seem worthwhile today
have a laddoo.
- What's the occasion?
I told you I want to participate in the fashion designing competition I paid the entry fees today.
- Really?
I'll take two laddoos.
- Why?
One for me and one for my God
Go ahead
Bye
What a shame
Bloody untuned drum!
Did your father ever play a guitar?
give it here
Papa is... a businessman in Indore
A businessman, really?
And you were playing the guitar, eh?
When did I say that?
The poor girl thought it was me
And you were tongue-tied, no?
You could only grin
Couldn't you say that it was me?
- Am I nuts to tell her that... it wasn't me but it was our master Sameer Malhotra who was playing?
She was so impressed, dude.
And she even saw the posters of your goddesses
Know what she said?
What a shame
You're in my half. I'll kiss anything that comes my way, I told you
The priest said it right!
You are not Sunny but Shani (Saturn)
Stay away from me
I got my temper under control!
I wish I could tear you apart
He's coming.
- Sunny, haVen't I reminded you... to pay the rent?
- l'Ve mailed the address to Daddy
He should be sending the money.
- lf it doesn't arrive this time... you will have to leave.
Remember.
- Uncle... did I ever harass you?
have I ever troubled you, aunt?
Then why don't you clean the railings?
Look...
Pay the rent, we'll clean it daily.
What...?
He's gone.
- You should'Ve told me ls Mr Duggal in?
- Yes.
So?
There's a letter for Sunny
Sunny stays here, right?
- Yes, dammit!
Go in
Mr Duggal, there's a letter for Sunny
Hey, where are you going?
give me.
- Two?
Two letters?
Whom is the second letter for?
- Only one!
I asked him to give it
So take it and drive him out.
- l'm going
move it.
Do you fancy eating and sleeping here?
Has he left?
Okay, read the letter.
- lt's for Sunny
Why should we read it?
- Why not?
He's our tenant
We must know what type of a person he is..
..what kind of people write to him
Read
Go on
Let me open it.
- ls it made of steel?
Dearest son, Sunny, ever since you have left, I'Ve been worried
Your planes are grieving.
There's no one to pilot them son, without you, what use are six bunglows and eight factories to me?
I hear, you are staying with a beggar lf you wish to extend your stay, revert back I'll present a huge bungalow to your landlord
Your Papa
I must leave now.
- Where are you going, son?
Papa hasn't sent money, not even a letter.
How can I stay here?
Did I really offend you?
Do you have a problem here, son?
No, no.
- All I haVe on me is a fake coin
You guys snatched 10,000 bucks from me..
..and you ask me if I haVe a problem 10,000?
Just ask me, and I'll give you 10,000 every day
But please don't quit this place
From now on, we'll cook for you.
I'll do your laundry too
Let go of my hand, will you?
And who will wear my underwear?
I will do that. I'll even give you a bath
But don't ever leave this place.
- Don't ever go, son
Tell you something... somebody has rightly said, if you want true love... stay in a poor man's shanty
Put the binoculars down!
Else, I'll inform the Colonel
Go ahead
Are you boozing?
I told you not to drink, didn't I?
Wait till I tell Mr Duggal.
- Go ahead and tell him
You wait here!
Mr Duggal!
Who the hell...?
Are you boozing here?
- D'you want me to sit on the roof?
What if I fall down?
- You're drunk I can't...!
You are blind now, I'll talk to you in the morning
Makes no difference. I'Ve been blind since morning
Don't mind the poor fellow.
Here, grab your bottle
Here you are.
- See?
That's a tenant
And you never treated me even to a cup of tea
He's helping me live it up, you know.
- Where is he taking you?
Oh, I forgot!
We got to meet Bijli!
Let's go
Come on.
Not there... this way
Don't go. lt's a bad habit.
- Don't go, my foot!
Clear the litter, will you?
- He tells me to clear the litter
Don't do it. lt's my house.
Who is he to give orders?
I'm going to throw it away!
- Pick it up and throw it outside!
Here goes!
Bloody...!
Who got smashed?
- Who?
The Colonel
Who hit him?
- Brother Sameer
Our friendly neighbourhood hunter.
He's hunted many a colonel down!
You are in my half, let me kiss you
Go, neck Bijli!
Rani, once again, forgive me
Neck Bijli, you will be forgiven
The thorn
Oh, the piercing thorn
Come, my love
Behind your bungalow, under the berry tree... my love... a thorn pierced me
Now that you are in trouble, you wonder... why you couldn't stay without me
Your friends were right when they said... you will be trapped someday
Get that?
I'm sorry... let bygones be bygones
save my heart this time, my love
Your clothes are skimpy... even the blindman says, show it to me
Show it
Get lost
move it
Another 15,000?
What for?
I haVe already paid 20,000
That was entry fees. 15,000 is entertainment tax
You should'Ve told me before.
The show is at hand, how can I raise...?
Entertainment tax is a government policy.
everybody knows that lf you don't pay by evening, you cannot do the show tomorrow
Why can't she?
She is my Rani
Don't weep... please don't
You will do the show I promise you, you will do the show
Sis, I just heard that the government says... it's illegal to get a girl married before she turns 21
Which means you have three more years to go, sis
And your sister-in-law has only three days
Why don't you concentrate on your studies for the next three years?
Shall I break the pot?
Thank you, dear sister
Still short of 5000!
I'm seriously stressed now
You got to help me now, God
That was for my sister's studies!
You could'Ve broken Your piggy bank
Come here... do you know her?
Hot, eh...?
You're throwing kisses at your sisters...?
I can't figure out what to say
Many people are responsible for this dream come true
But there is someone I want to specially thank I don't know his name, nor do I recognise him I'Ve never met him, but he's the anonymous friend... who helped me out when I needed support the most
He calls himself my well-wisher I appeal to him. if you can hear me... please come and meet me. I'd like to personally thank you
My dear God, grandma always says that a princess will come into my life
But not even a maid-serVant has come into it till today
But I feel today as if the Princess will surely come
God, don't mess up things.
I loVe her too much I'd have called her home, but Sunny's around, you see?
So I'Ve called her here.
Nothing wrong, is there?
Nothing wrong.
everything you'Ve done is good I'Ve heard it all Sameer.
That which you tried to say... and also that which you didn't say.
You did so much for me... and didn't even let me know?
You shall pine at heart, my love... by God, you too shall fall in love
At heart, I shall desire you too
by God, I hope I fall in love too
You're charming... you're my love, you're my romance I'm bowled over... yes, I acknowledge that I know, your love is full of mischief
But I can't help it, my heart just won't agree
How I wish I rule your heart
By God, may you fall in love too
They call me beautiful, they call me the proud one... and you'Ve gone crazy; you have no control over your heart I'm no less crazy. I'm not conceding defeat I'm here to steal your heart, and steal it, I will
How I wish I begin to trust you
By God, I hope I fall in love too
May you begin to pine at heart
By God, may you fall in love too
God!
What a sweet dream!
Make it come true, please!
Here she is!
By the way, You'Ve done a great job in making her, God
Sunny...?
Can't be!
God, why's he...?
Sunny!
You...?
Which means you're the well-wisher...?
I didn't want to say it.
But I knew... you'd get to know some day.
- But...
Stop necking him!
give me the hug!
He's a fraud!
You... my...?
Rani!
Rani!
Don't go with him!
I'm me...
I'm not him!
I'm the one she loves.
leave her alone!
God!
Make him see reason!
Let go of her cheek, you scoundrel!
Rani, I'm the real one!
I'm not him!
Out of the way, Colonel!
Step aside!
What...?
Step up...?
Out of the way!
Out!
What happened...?
Who got smashed?
The Colonel got smashed!
Sunny, don't be shy, have some more.
Eat to your fill
The milk reminds me of home
This is your home too.
- Absolutely
We can't ever forget what you have done for our Rani
And you didn't even let me know.
- Ma always says... your left hand must not know what your right hand does
Hear that?
Such lofty ideals!
- Pickles!
I don't know where they are
Not pickles, ideals, darling.
- ideals, I see
They are poles apart.
One is an angel while the other is a demon
The more distance l keep from him, the closer he gets to deal a blow
With a football, when I'm at home.
With a bottle, when I'm outside
When I'm walking on the footpath..
..he calls me in the middle of the road... and rams his motorbike into me
Be careful.
Say it again, Sameer
Colonel, I'm sorry, I'Ve been a bloody fool
Accept these flowers and please forgive me
Okay, I forgive you
Where does the Colonel get his Voice?
- God knows
Where did he transpire from?
Wake up!
We are here
Who is this sleepy character?
- A security guard
He tried to mess with me, I put him on a three-months' night shift
No wonder he brings his wife to make an appeal to you
Uncle!
How are you, dear niece?
- You'Ve pulled down!
Can't tell you what I'Ve been through
Rani's uncle?
This man could'Ve been your Cupid... but you'Ve already plunged him into the darkness
Brother-in-law, you are wrapped all over in bandages?
What happened?
Sunny, he is my wife's brother
Swine!
Where have you been all this while?
Brother, I'm cross with you.
We live in the same city, yet... you haVen't been here for months.
- What city, sister?
I don't even get to see my wife.
- What does that mean?
This new manager, the swine, has put me on night shift since two months
He sleeps during the daytime, and stays up like an owl during the nights
He's suffering from constipation and acidity
Look at the dark circles below his eyes
That's fine, but who's that scoundrel?
That's fine, but who are you?
- Uncle, he is Sunny.
Our neighbour I see.
Glad to meet you.
- We'll meet later
You were talking about some manager...
- Don't even mention the swine
What has he done?
- He's made life miserable for me
What's his name?
- Bloody Saturn!
Shut up
Sameer
Uncle, our Sameer.
Your neighbour.
My roommate Sameer
What...?
Sameer stays in the neighbourhood?
Which beggar in the neighbourhood?
- Not a beggar, it's Sameer
One who wrecked you!
Now he's after him
That swine is after my whole family
Time's not favourable, Sameer
Forget the flowers, forget the colonel, placate the uncle
Uncle...
The tables have turned.
Now watch the fun
Uncle, aunt...
I'Ve got some presents for you
Skirt and blouse for you
Bush shirt for you, uncle
Sweets for the kids
Also some fruits for the two of you I hope you don't expect these things to bear fruit?
Oh no, of course not
Uncle, if by any chance I haVe uttered something wrong... please forgive me. I'Ve realised that I'Ve been unfair to you
You are off the night shift.
- What...?
Then how about tonight...?
- Sure
Son-in-law...
- Son-in-law...?
Son-in-law, indeed.
The other day when I asked you about Rani... had you answered me, you'd have been married by now
And I would be your uncle
Uncle, a mistake is committed by mistake
You must also have committed a mistake, by mistake, no?
Aunt, am I wrong?
- You are absolutely right, son-in-law
Greetings.
- Greetings.
Come in
Colonel sahib...
- You!
Don't you dare step inside!
Stay where you are
Colonel sahib, consider it my bad luck or my karma... for all my good intentions, things invariably go wrong... and I end up hurting you.
- 5000 people live around here
Of all, why do you always choose to hurt me?
Colonel sahib, the new year is about to set in, in a few hours time
With the passing year, let bygones be bygones, please l beg your forgiveness
D'you take me for a coward?
Remember, I'm a soldier I kept forgiving you because I considered you a kid
Not anymore
Get this loud and clear
Henceforth, for 50 metres around me... if I see you, or see you throwing anything... the last time I fired my gun was against the Portuguese... this time it's going to be you
Yes, colonel sahib
Happy happy new... handcuffs
is this a new way to wish a new year?
- l'll tell you
Where's Charles?
Charles?
Or Sameer?
- Sameer?
is he a new kid in the Charles gang?
have women joined Charles' gang too?
There's no aunty here!
Oh, this one?
What's the problem in his pants?
- Today he's become a police officer
Become, eh?
Tell me something... you're an honest officer's wife, how do you know such criminals?
I'm not a criminal, ask you neighbour if you wish
Who neighbour?
The retired soldier?
Now I get it.
After retirement he's been sheltering criminals
Let me go.
Rani is waiting for me.
- Waiting for what?
To murder someone?
To loot a bank?
Or to print fake stamp papers?
- What the hell...?
Boy, you are going to rot here until the police Van arrives
Then you'll go to jail.
Come on, don't stare at him
The ass who smashed his head is on the loose, and I'm trapped here
Am I wearing a convict's clothes?
Am I going to meet Rani in 2010?
Ladies and gentleman... and friends, let me show you another magical act
Look, this is magic
forgive me, Mr Magician, but pulling out a bouquet from a cloth... a pigeon from a turban and a rabbit from a box is quite simple I'll believe you if you can cast a spell on me
He's challenging me
All right, boy, it's no big deal.
Lie down on the bench
Sure.
That's no big magic
No, but it's going to be
Friends, now my magic wand is going to suspend this boy in thin air
If a stick can make someone float in the air... no one would care to buy air tickets.
They would be waiting for the stick I'm an astrologer, you see.
- Before you stands a magician, fool
C'mon, lie down!
- At your service
Windbag!
Here I go
Abracadabra!
Let the boy float in air
Don't mess with a magician!
Or, you will stay suspended in air
Magician, I believe you now I fear, I might go right up there I pray, put me down
All right
How he lifted him up, we didn't even get to know
This girl wouldn't believe me
Rani, your arm on my shoulder is one pretty sight
Let me make it simple for you, Sameer
Stay 50 metres away from Papa and 500 metres away from me.
You dig?
I'll show you guys a wonder now
You... please come here
Me...?
- Don't go!
He'll put you in a box... and hack you to pieces...
One boy.
Any one, please
Mr Magician, there's a boy!
Strong, rough, tough and reliable
Seize your chance before Sunny arrives.
Go!
Come this side, please.
- No, I'm fine here
Please come here lf he is in, I'm off.
Find someone else
Hang on, lady
Rather I'd leave I get it
The two of you are cross with each other.
All right... I'll turn the enmity into friendship.
- Can you do that?
Of course, and I'll turn your hatred into love
Hang on.
Your name?
- Rani
And you are...?
- Sameer
So, Sameer and Rani... the two of you are man and wife from now on
And tonight, is your first New Year night
Tell everyone how much you love each other
What are you staring at?
- Admiring you
Had you not traipsed into my life, I'd have been a nobody I'd have been an anklet sans the chime
I'd have been a soleless shoe
A heartless body lf not for you, Rani...
- Not Rani... call me Mrs Sameer Malhotra
To be honest, I fell in love with you at first sight I haVe endured so much to possess you
Don't torment me anymore.
Come...
Well...
I can wait no longer either
Your beloved seeks your heart
Come to me, my love
Profess your love
give in to me, my love
I'm pining, so are you I'm waiting for you
Profess your love
give in to me, my love
Your charms... like the tempest, my love
Your looks... my identity, my love
Gaze into my eyes
Make me belong to you
Profess your love
give in to me, my love
You have done me a favour
You are in my dreams... you are all I desire
Let's make a legend of love
Come my love, make me go crazy in your love
Profess your love
give in to me, my love
Your beloved seeks your heart
Come to me, my love
Profess your love... give in to me, my love
Come to me, my love
give in to me, Sweetheart
The Prince has fallen in love with the Princess...
Sameer, I'Ve been thinking.
- What?
You can play the guitar, paint, sing... you're quite a multi-talented man.
- Guess why?
That's because I'm me.
Not you!
having a ball, aren't you?
- You have a great talent too
What?
- You tell lies to fool people!
Listen, make a portrait for me too
Don't mind, but I paint only beautiful people!
Know what?
- What, what?
I'm in a great mood today.
Say what you want to
You aren't as innocent as you appear to be
Why?
How you brought Rani around in just two hours last night
Weren't you jealous!
As close as you get to her, I want to get closer to her too
Aren't you jealous?
Aren't you?
What's your problem?
My problem is that I want to score with my friend's girlfriends... it makes me Very happy!
When I get married, I want you to paint me and my wife together
You know, with her at my side.
And I lying down in her lap
She in black-and-white, I in colour...
Sure, I will
Whom are you marrying?
Bijli?
No, it's Rani
Aren't you jealous?
Aren't you?
See?
Your temper hurts you yourself, doesn't it?
If it wasn't for the oath, I'd have squeezed him out like the tube!
Where's Sameer?
- The brush!
Get to be the master's disciple!
Quick!
Life's a dream...
Who...?
Rani, you...?
You can even paint!
- Well, I...
My painting...?
How sweet!
Tears and desires, that's how it is
You're quite a revelation, Sunny.
- No revelation
Painting, singing, the guitar...
No wonder they call you multi-talented
Sameer's multi-talented too
You ought to have seen him at the party last night
The way he sang and danced... I'Ve been teaching him classical dancing and he's into rock?
Anyway, fresh orange juice for the two of you.
Where's he?
He's in the latrine right now
He'll take some time.
You can wait.
- No thank you
give him some and you have some too.
Happy New Year
Was Rani here?
- Yes, she was
You'll now ask me if even my father has even done any painting
And I'll say, my Papa's a Very big businessman in Indore
You'll say, Liar, dog...
- That you really are
Your dream of making Rani fall in love with you will remain a pipe dream lt won't be a pipe dream.
Because I know what your weakness is
Really?
What is it?
You can never tell Rani that you love her
So listen!
I swear it on my grandma!
I will profess my love to Rani in the presence of the whole world today!
And I swear it on my father in Indore too I'm the one who'll bring Rani to this house, as a bride
If my love is true, I'll be the one who'll marry Rani
And if I'm determined enough, I'll lead her here by the hand
For me.
You are Rani's brother
No brother. I'm her lover
Rani, you think this loVer-boy is an accomplished singer and painter I'll expose him to you today
C'mon, sweetheart, let's go
This juice Rani brought for you I'll have it
Hold it!
Who did she bring it for?
- For you
So I'll drink it!
Share it with me!
I can't share anything of Rani's!
May you find it bitter!
I find everything of Rani's to be sweet
At least let out a burp!
I'll paint a picture and also sing a song... and expose Sunny.
Okay?
What new ailment is this?
One Duggal is difficult to tolerate
Three, five...?
More than I can endure!
Where do you think you're going?
Stop there!
Lie down here, Rani. I'll put them to bed and return
C'mon!
Eagle!
I'm going to make you a seagull!
Senior!
Swat this fly!
You'Ve made a mistake by messing with the Eagle Gang!
One Sunny I can't tolerate.
And six of them walk up to me!
I'm going to thrash all six of them!
C'mon!
Tommy!
Come here!
Come!
You always bark at me, don't you?
So bark now... bark!
The next time you bark, you're going to disappear.
You get that...?
Take care of your kids and your dogs!
I'll spare you this time.
Next time, you're gone
Tommy, my son, don't keep going outside
There are bad people in the locality
have I ever raised my Voice with you?
have I?
And how Sameer was yelling at you yesterday!
The insolent chap!
Go and play in the house, son.
And don't go out... my good son!
Tommy!
Tommy...
Tommy, where have you gone?
You ought to have considered what would happen to me without you!
Darling, we too are sad that Tommy's gone missing
But how long will you keep starving, thinking about him?
Let's eat, Papa. I'm hungry too
No, my child. I don't feel like it
Colonel... I'Ve looked everywhere in Goa, but there's no trace of Tommy I don't know where he has gone.
Could someone have kidnapped him?
But who could be Tommy's enemy?
Mr Duggal!
That's it
No... he hasn't been around since yesterday
Sameer...?
- Why Sameer?
No, can't be Sameer.
But he could do a thing like this too.
Remember his public threat?
That he'd make the dog disappear!
If the dog barks, I'll kill him, I'll finish him!
No way, he was drunk.
- Really...?
But who then...?
He's the culprit!
Who is it?
That scoundrel has broken me in every part of my body!
I don't know what revenge he is extracting from me... by having Tommy separated from me!
Sameer!
Where are you hiding, you thief?
This is a warning!
If you don't return Tommy to me in 24 hours... I'll have you sent to jail!
I still hold sway among the cops.
I'm not sparing you!
What does that mean?
- He has influence
give him the dog!
May the worms get you!
What new fuss is this...?
have your father treated
Why'd I haVe my brother-in-law kidnapped anyway?
Why...?
Where am I going to look for this dog now?
You have a Variety of dogs
- Hush!
Don't call them dogs.
They take offense I'Ve brought them up like my own children
That's Rustom, that's Sohrab.
Eats less, snarls all the time
That's Cyrus.
Faithful.
But eats and enjoys a good life
And that is...
This is the dog I want.
Do you have it?
I do have it!
That's my boy, Tin Tin!
Say hello!
Quite a good boy.
But once he loses his temper... he's going to bite.
And remember... don't ever give him a cold bath
But this one doesn't have a black spot.
- Don't worry!
Here's the solution!
Mr Colonel...
look who's here
Tommy!
My son...!
Where had you gone away to?
Where did you find him, Sameer?
- The poor chap... was sitting by a lamp-post, shivering.
He used to always bark at me
But this time, he said, Papa...
and went for my feet
He appeared to be telling me, Please take me to my Papa
Papa...?
- You
Oh yes!
He's like my son, of course!
Papa, it's because of Sameer that we have Tommy back today
You must forgive him at least now.
- Sure, I forgive him!
Rama, lay the table
What's happening here?
Look at this, Sunny!
Tommy's back today because of Sameer
Look me in the eye, my brother!
Where did you find the dog...?
Where did you find it?
I went mad looking for it!
For Rani's sake, look into my eyes!
Where did you find the dog?
Tell me!
Sunny, I don't know what's gotten into my Tommy
He's been behaving like a stranger ever since he has returned
He seems to have changed.
- He has stayed with the stray dogs I know a cure!
Squeeze him in a bucket of cold water!
Squeeze him ?
- l mean, give him a cold bath
Oh, I see.
All right
Please sit down.
- Won't you give Tommy a bath?
No!
I'll first give Tommy a bath.
I'll have breakfast later
The breakfast will get cold, papa.
- l'll be back soon, my child
Let's take a bath, Tommy boy!
- Where's Sameer?
Sunny, please call Sameer, will you?
- Not me, he sleeps till late
He'll hit me for no reason.
You go and call him instead
All right, I'll call him
We shall overcome...
Who is it?
Are you asleep, Sameer?
Wake up!
Sunny, don't change your Voice and bother me!
Let me sleep!
Rani...?
One second.
I'll be out there
Who are you...?
Who on earth are you?
- Bijli
But who...?
- lt's Rani
One moment, Rani. I'm coming!
What are you doing here?
What?
- What are you doing here?
I was sleeping with you I came to call you for breakfast I'Ve said nothing!
I'll join you in two seconds!
Go away!
- Where?
Want me to come...?
- Go away!
give that to me?
- What?
That one.
- What?
I'm coming inside
God!
I'm so sorry, Rani.
How disgusting!
What you think is wrong, Rani!
- How about what I see?
This one...?
It's not mine. lt's hers!
I'Ve done nothing wrong, Rani.
Please try to understand...
You... I'll fix you!
Rani...
That piece of thorn
I swear it on you, Rani!
I don't know that girl!
How could you with a girl you don't know...?
I swear, I don't even know her!
- Without knowing them... will you call just about any girl?
- Listen to me, Rani...
You'Ve started getting girls into your bed now!
This is too much, Rani!
Listen to me!
Hey girl, can't you hear what boss is saying to you?
Do just as the boss says.
Okay?
Else the Eagle Gang will catch you and present you to the boss, okay?
What are you guys saying?
- Command us, boss!
No one dares oppose you!
Do what you want to.
Here on the streets!
Go for her!
Grab her!
Grab her...?
- No, I won't
This was all that was left!
You're a loafer.
And a drunkard!
You're a womaniser!
Now you're leader of the Eagle gang!
I'm not the leader.
- Shame on you, Sameer!
Forget her, boss.
There's one better than the other in Goa
Point out a girl.
She'll be in your arms
After a nice cold bath...
Tommy will become a handsome boy
He'll be good looking.
Those dirty dogs in the lane...?
don't ever play with them, okay?
See how dirty you are
Good boy!
Good boy!
bravo...
What's this?
A black dye?
So this isn't my Tommy!
Hey... are you a wild dog?
Rama!
The dog has bitten me!
Rama!
It isn't our Tommy!
It's a duplicate of Tommy!
Sameer has given us a wild dog!
The black dye came off when I was giving it a bath!
Look!
I'm not sparing Sameer!
He's made the dog bite me!
God!
He acts like a butcher!
After beating him black and blue..
..he's now setting the dogs after him!
He has no respect for his elders!
He'll need to take 14 injections in the stomach now
Go and take the first one.
- Go on...
Tiny injections they'll give him
Sameer, I'm Raj, the astrologer
Here you are!
And I'Ve been looking for you all over Goa l'm looking for Sameer, too.
Let me know if you find him I want to break his limbs!
- No... liquor isn't good for you!
- lt's blessed wine
Look!
Rani and Sunny...
No!
It isn't Rani!
It's someone else
Really?
Very well
With you, I'll work wonders, O beautiful one
With you, I'll work wonders, O beautiful one
Let's rock to the music, O beautiful one
How shall you have me...?

Stop it, stop it...
Rickety old rickshaw!
- That'll be 40 rupees, ma'am
Here you are.
- But this is 20 Rupees
every senior citizen gets a discount of 50 per cent
Whether it's the bus or a railway train
Besides, yours is a rickety old rickshaw!
Grandma!
Grandma is here!
Look at this kid!
He's calling me a grandma!
Sameer...
- Grandma, don't call Sameer
He's a bad boy!
- Why?
He ran away with my chocolate yesterday
And today, I will run away with your glasses!
give my glasses to me!
- l'm running away... come after me!
My glasses...
- What's happening here?
Make this old fossil see reason, please
But he's my husband.
- What!
No, I'm her son!
- Son?
She's my Mummy!
Mummy, ask grandma to get me a chocolate!
My darling son, give my glasses to me
On one condition.
- What?
We'll play Cricket with it.
- l can't see anything!
I'll toss it up like a ball.
You must catch it
everyone in Rani's family hates me.
That includes her dog, Tommy
Grandma, that's your grandson's love story then
Now you tell me what I am to do.
- My son... why must you worry?
Now that I haVe arrived, everything will be all right
Just show me the girl once. I'll go and talk it over with her, okay?
Come, I'll show you.
- My son!
That's Rani, grandma
Where, son...?
- over there, grandma
She's right there
Yes, yes...
- lsn't she beautiful?
Absolutely beautiful!
But I can't see a thing!
You go to the office and get on with your work, my son I'll go to her house and talk it over, okay?
Okay, grandma.
- Bye, son
My child...
- l'm here, ma'am
What spell have you cast on Sameer?
- What?
He's madly in love with you!
You're the only one he talks about, in everything he does
What are you talking about?
You know the Colonel...
My child, I know the Colonel is Very angry with Sameer
Once you agree to the wedding... the Colonel will have to get out of your way!
My child, do not be afraid. lf you're in love with Sameer... not the Colonel and not any power in..
..the world can separate you both!
Sameer?
And Rama?
My grandson will give you the bliss the Colonel never could if you're afraid of the Colonel, I'll help the two of you elope!
Sameer hasn't come yet.
I wonder what's up
He'll come, grandma
Here he is.
- Grandma...
have you talked it over, grandma?
- Oh yes, son. I haVe
Very good.
Has Rani agreed?
- Yes, Rani has agreed
You now need to talk to her mother..
..and she'll bring the Colonel around
Make an eleven rupee offering.
And that'll be it!
Grandma!
That's water!
The coffee's in this one here!
ever since my glasses have broken..
..I can't see a single thing, my son
Grandma, how could you have spoken to Rani then?
One uses his mouth to speak, my son.
Not one's eyes
You must'Ve chosen right.
- Sure
How many fingers, grandma?
- Four
Three... two...
- Grandma!
I'm not totally blind yet, son.
I can still see a bit
And why must you worry?
Go and talk it over with Rani's mother
Sameer!
Let me have your glasses fixed, ma'am ln just a little while, we'll reach your in-laws' house
And here we are!
Praise the Colonel!
- What are you doing?
Holy water from St. Peter's church.
Go on.
Neither is the old man there... ..nor is your future wife.
Go and talk it over with your future mother-in-law!
Will she listen to me?
- Of course
Just latch the door from inside!
- Why ?
Neither will she go out, nor will she send you out
Once the matter is settled, unlatch the door.
Very simple
Go on. I'm right here!
Sameer... why are you latching the door?
So that you don't send me out of the house... nor leave the house yourself
Was this the time for this angel of death to return...?
What you're doing is wrong, Sameer ls falling in love wrong?
I ask you... have you never been in love?
- Well, I...
You have, haVen't you?
So why all the restrictions in my love?
Now look, Sameer.
You...
Sameer!
Where's Sameer?
He's in there, with your wife
- What...?
You can't go inside till Sameer's work is over
Till Sameer's work is done...?
give me an opportunity. I haVe so much to give in love!
I beg you, Sameer.
Please go away
No.
Unless you agree, I can't go away lt'll take only two minutes.
Let him do it, Colonel!
I'll see what he's upto!
Colonel!
Why're you so scared even after grandma has spoken to you?
The Colonel used to be a colonel.
And you are the colonel of this family lf you say yes, what can the colonel do about it?
For God's sake, leave my sari alone!
Let them get on with it!
If the youngsters run away, who'll lose face...?
Who'll get a bad name...?
- Get lost!
Your sari's stuck
Don't worry. I'll have it freed
Look at the evil man!
What's on your mind, my child?
like you folks think
Nothing happened...
Sameer didn't misbehaVe with me I thought Very hard over it
What I feel is... he had come to talk about you
He's madly in love with you.
What about you?
is it Sameer?
Or Sunny?
I don't understand, Mama
Sunny is a nice guy
I like Sameer too.
But Papa hates him I'm in a dilemma.
- Look, my child... don't worry about mine and your father's likes
Decide for yourself I'm finding it difficult to decide
What you got to gauge is, who loves you the most...
Sameer, or Sunny
And if you are still confused, leave it to God
My red Veil... flutters in the flowing wind
And my beloved casts glances at me... on the sly I know he will love me... but he'll make my life miserable
Red Veil... your red Veil... flutters in the flowing wind
Your red Veil flutters in the flowing wind
And your beloved casts glances at you... on the sly I'll give you my heart... I'll even die for you
For all my efforts to hide my pretty face... it hardly took time for the cruel breeze... to break my resolve
Your moon-like face has cast a spell all around
The sight of you... puts even the moon to shame
I'm coy.
- Goodness me I'm apprehensive.
- Goodness me
Come into my arms, let not this opportunity go wasted
Your beloved has already seen you... on the sly, though I'll give you my heart... I'll even die for you I know he will love me... but he'll make life miserable for me
This fragrant ambience... invites us to make love
My pretty love... give in to your beloved
The fragrance of your love... has merged into my breath
Here, my love, I give up everything... I give in to you
You are desirous...
- Goodness me you admit.
- Goodness me
No stopping me now... I'm unstoppable
My beloved has seen me... on the sly I know he will love me... but he'll make life miserable for me I'll give you my heart... I'll even die for you
My red Veil... flutters in the flowing wind
Your red Veil... flutters in the flowing wind
And your beloved casts glances at you... on the sly, though I know he will love me... but he'll make my life miserable I'll give you my heart... I'll even die for you
My son, you came here in quest of peace
Where will you go now?
- l'll go to a place... where there are no people at all.
The Andaman-Nicobar islands
You'll clash with a guy even if he's the only one around in town
Do what you will, but you can't change your destiny I know how much you love Rani, my son
Will you leave her also and go away?
I'm not happy to leave I haVe to go away.
That's how the situation is
Let's go, grandma. lt's time the boat sailed
Look after yourself.
- Sameer... well, well!
The priest, if not Rani, what say?
What's up?
- l'm leaving
Hey!
You can't leave me and go away
Not you alone. I'm leaving this world behind
You'Ve only seen Rani and me getting together
Won't you stay for the wedding?
Guess who played the biggest role in bringing Rani and me together?
He kept making mistakes and she kept getting closer to me
Oh yes, that's a solid idea you gave me!
Of publicly proposing to Rani!
Incidentally, India and Pakistan are playing a cricket match today I'Ve invited her father.
Rani will be there too I'm thinking of saying it to her in public!
Rani, will you marry me?
You're lucky... because I'Ve stopped dreaming about Rani
Enjoy yourself
Fights, brawls, show of temper... and proposing to girls are things real men do
I'd rather you play the guitar, Sameer
Today's match is going to be a terrific affair... because, for the first time, we have the Indian and Pakistani teams... playing a friendly match in this stadium in Goa today
Paa-ji's here!
Get out of the way!
Where do you think you're going?
Get out!
Who's that in the stadium?
He's grabbed the mike from Pa-ji I'll...
Rani!
Where are you?
He's come here, looking for Rani!
Who's Rani?
What's he shouting Rani for?
Who's she?
It has to do with the heart.
Keep it up, brave lad!
Go for her!
Looks like it has to do with love
Rani...
listen to me...
Where're you hiding, sis-in-law?
The boss is so upset!
He'll find her.
He sure will.
- Sis-in-law!
Rani... where are you?
You mess with my mike?
You fight with me?
Rani!
All I'll say is that you mustn't marry Sunny!
He's not worthy of you!
It's a question of your life!
Hold it, hold it... he has something to say.
Looks like it has to do with love
Here you are
Rani, I'm not the sort of guy you think I am
Yes, I made the mistake of keeping my temper under control
Else, I'd have beaten Sunny black and blue and throw him out of Goa
But Sunny's done a wonderful thing today
He has stopped me from going away
There's something I want to say to you, Rani
Rani... I loVe you
I haVe loved you ever since I first set eyes on you
Since the day the Colonel started hating me
Colonel... I'Ve made a lot of mistakes.
Please forgive me
Rani, if you're not in love with me... it's cool. I'll go away
But I haVe a feeling that you do
That you do love me
And thus, I publicly...
He's Very upset!
I'm not asking for too much. I only want you to marry me... so that we can have a family.
We can have kids... who take after you in looks; eyes, nose, lips, cheeks et al l only want them to have my surname... because my dad had the surname Malhotra
All I want to say to you is...
Ask her, Will you marry me?
- l'll marry you, if she doesn't!
Rani... will you marry me?
Louder!
Will you marry me?
Can't hear you!
Rani!
Will you marry me?
Will you marry me...?
Say yes, sister-in-law.
- Please say yes!
Rani, I think he's the right boy for you
He at least won't hit me after he's married to you
Say yes, girl!
Go on!
That's a spirited boy.
He's in love with you!
He's saying as much in public.
So say yes!
Let the birds fly!
Say yes, sister-in-law!
Go on, my child.
Go!
Our kids will take after you in eyes and smile
And I like the surname Malhotra
Could I haVe the mike, please?
As my mother used to say... anger is love's worst enemy
One who can't control his temper, can't control anything in his lifetime
Sameer, my mother says, anger is love's worst enemy
One who can't control his temper, can't control anything in his lifetime
Not your mother!
That's what my friend Arun's mother used to say!
You remember what your friend used to say
But you'Ve forgotten your friend?
You can't be Arun!
You're a scoundrel!
Arun was a gem of a guy!
Guess whose house I went to first, on my return from America... after 19 years?
Yours!
Sameer's not here.
Who are you?
- lt's me!
Sameer's childhood friend.
Arun!
Good God!
Where's my buddy, grandma?
- He's away in Goa ls he still as hot-tempered, or has he calmed down?
His temper has got worse with age, my son
Grandma then told me about your problem... how you had had a heart-break, how you had gone away to Goa... met Rani there and fallen in love with her... and how, for her sake, you had suppressed your anger
Okay then. I'll go and phone Sameer
No, grandma.
You won't say a word to him I'm going to treat him not as his friend, but as his adversary
That's how I landed in Goa... to stay with your house, in your room, with you!
I now know why you did this all the time, buddy boy!
C'mon!
The insolent!
- Go topless
Those with iron pajamas...
- have an ape for an Uncle!
Whose aunts are cats...
- have dogs for friends!
When it comes to the pickle...
- They hug, buddy!
The insolent!
- Go topless
Those with iron pajamas!
- have an ape for an Uncle!
Whose aunts are cats...
- have dogs for friends!
When it comes to the pickle...
- They hug, buddy!
What happened?
What's up now?
All over again!
What wrong have I done now?
- You're ill-fated, son I'm jinxed!
But nothing can go wrong now
The poor chap's been suffering all this while
For your sake, he has remained a bachelor
You shall now become his bride... marry him
marry him
It seemed as if this chap was my tormentor
But he's the one who has shown me the right path
however, you are the one who shall become my bride
You must become his sister-in-law... you must marry me
Five!
Five!
Greetings, sire.
- May you be happy
Please take a look at my grandson's horoscope and predict his future
Certainly
Let me see your forehead
The lines on his forehead make it so obvious... that the fury of Jupiter, the Sun, Mars and Saturn will rule his life
They will dominate his life totally!
Should he be provoked by someone... this boy will certainly not spare him
What should we name him?
Sameer.
A gust of cool breeze.
- Sameer...?
By nature, he's hot-headed.
The name will keep him calm
Come to me, come...
Guess what?
Don't ever make the mistake of getting him married
There you are!
He has kicked me!
As he grows up, he'll use his fists and kicks more than his mouth!
I'm not sparing you!
I'm not sparing you!
Never!
Sameer!
Let him go!
Leave him alone!
C'mon, Sameer!
Come with me!
Sameer, why did you raise your hand at the Principal?
When I lose my temper... it feels as if a hundred guitars are playing in my brains!
Now tell me something.
Why did you hit Chintu?
I was angry because he abused you!
Sameer, my mother says, anger is love's worst enemy
One who can't control his temper, can't control anything in his lifetime
Now stop being angry and smile.
Smile!
So you won't smile...?
I'll set your mood right in a moment
The insolent!
- Go topless
Those with iron pajamas...
- Have an ape for an Uncle!
Whose aunts are cats...
- Have dogs for friends!
When it comes to the pickle...
- They hug, buddy!
Sameer gets into a fight with someone or the other every day... and today, he raised his hands on me!
The Principal!
So much of anger is not good, Ma'am.
It's Arun who always calms him down
He was born with the temper.
How will I explain...?
Ever since his parents have died, his temper is getting worse and worse
I understand, ma'am.
And that is why I'm not throwing him out of the school
But I'm really worried.
If this is how Sameer Malhotra's childhood is... how is his adolescence going to be?
So these three fractures and the 36 stitches... is it all your doing?
- Yes, sir.
I've thrashed them
But you must ask them why I hit them
There's this girl Sameer wants to marry... and these guys were treating her like a ball in the basket!
In 1998, you beat up a professor in the college?
He didn't have any time to teach the boys
But he used to call the girls home all alone and gave them tuitions
He had evil on his mind.
So I gave it to him!
What wrong did I do?
In the year 2000, you rescued a man who was drowning... and gave him a beating?
- I was the one who saved him too!
There was a board which said in bold letters, Swimming is forbidden
Why did he go there?
I gave it to him... what wrong did I do?
Look, we have received eight complaints against you in the last five years
You might get more
If I receive another complaint, you're going straight to jail!
Roma...?
You've got married?
Don't be angry today.
Please don't hit someone
I'll...
- No, wait here
There's no saying when he might hit someone
You think I'll hit you?
Why?
How can I hit you?
I...
And I thought you...
Did you think I'd marry you?
- Yes
Have you ever told me that you love me?
- No
And look at him.
He's so sweet, so gentle... he loves me so much.
And you...
Now listen to me.
No girl can ever fall in love with you
She can only be afraid of you.
- Why?
You have such a temper, even I'm afraid of you
Remember how you thrashed those boys at the basketball court, Sameer?
But they had made a mistake.
They had to be punished
Every human being makes a mistake.
What if I had made a mistake?
You'd have hit me too, isn't it?
Isn't it true?
Let's go
Sameer, are you really going away?
- Yes, grandma
I've got the job of a lifeguard in Goa.
It's a nice job
Besides, I get into a lot of fights here, grandma
If I go to a new place and meet new people, I might not get into fights
My son, think again before you go
The reason behind the fights is your temper
Your temper will go with you wherever you go
Yes, brother.
If you leave, I'll be worried about you all the time
You're the one I'll worry about.
I've got to get you educated and married
I've got to have an operation conducted on grandma's eyes... and send her to grandpa in heaven at the earliest
I'm not going away in a hurry.
He'll have to wait!
But before you leave, you'll have to promise me... that you won't get into fights and brawls with anyone
Is that clear, my son?
Grandma, I swear it on your head
I'll never lose my temper again
One, two... is that your luggage, mister?
Also this bag?
Four...?
Four bags?
Yes
Which is THE bag?
I mean, the bag in which you're carrying the cash and valuables...?
Terrible times, you see.
You could easily be robbed
Robberies are commonplace in trains nowadays
Difficult to tell the bonafide passenger from the thief!
Go to sleep.
I'll stay awake.
- I'm not sleepy
Mister, this period between 3 and 5 in the morning... is meant to be spent in slumber.
However strong a man is... he does drift into it at least once
I want to see when you go to sleep.
- I told you, I'm not sleepy
All right.
Actually, I love my forty winks
I'm going to sleep
Yes, grandma, I've reached safely.
Okay...
Thank you, mister.
- What for?
For looking after my luggage
I'll explain.
I have a weakness.
I can't stay awake in the night
And I can't sleep in the train, for fear of losing my luggage... and that is why, I pulled off the fast one
So that I could go to sleep and you'd look after my luggage.
Nice idea, eh?
Know what?
You're a great guy
I think I must travel with you on my way back too
Here's my card.
Phone me on this number, I'll find you at the station
Help me, grandma!
Praise the Lord...
Lord, protect my grandson wherever he is
Lord, help Sameer find his love
Lord!
You...?
- Yes.
I'm Raj.
He's Paul
Our misfortune, we're brothers.
Twins
I'm an astrologer who predicts people's future from their birthcharts... and he ruins their future!
What does your brother do?
- He belongs to the Eagle gang... very dangerous people.
Never cross their path
Never.
- You appear to be a stranger in town
Whom are you visiting?
- Mr Duggal
Mr Duggal!
- Yes, he has a vacant room
Not just a room, his brains are empty too
He used to be a police inspector in Goa... and has blood clotted in his head ever since a thief struck him with a stick
Wherever the clot stands, that part becomes useless
He plays deaf, dumb and blind
Let's see what he's playing today
He's playing blind today
I don't believe this!
- You will, very soon
That's Mr Duggal!
But he's looking at me.
- No, you're looking at him
Let me show you.
Wait
Rascals!
You hit me because I'm blind today?
When I start seeing again, none of you will be seen around here again!
Do you believe it now?
Wait a moment
I'm glad you're here.
I haven't had any tea
Give me half a litre of milk
Is the milk over, Bansi?
I'm not Bansi.
I'm Sameer.
I'm sorry, I thought you were the milkman
When did the headlights go off?
How does that concern you?
You're not a doctor, are you?
Give me the milk.
- But I'm not a milkman...
I'm Raj, the astrologer!
- The astrologer!
Such a big mouth!
- It's not my mouth.
It's a bag
And here is your mouth!
- Let me be, please!
What brings you here...?
- I'm the one who came here
I've landed a job at the beach resort.
Mr Sharma has had a word with you
For the room, isn't it?
Come, I'll take you to your room
I'll show you to your room
Go upstairs from here.
Your room is right ahead.
Go on
There's no room there!
- No?
But I saw it last night.
Did it disappear overnight?
Hello.
- You're showing him the wrong place
The room is over there!
- Where?
Here!
Come with me.
- You're throwing me out...?
We're actually going in!
I'll check out the room later.
Let's talk about the rent first
I can pay you 2500 at the most.
- I'll collect at least 5000 rupees!
It's okay if you agree.
Or you may leave...
Hey!
It's me!
- Why do you keep butting in?
Give him half the room for 2500.
Find another tenant for the other half
Is Bansi staying with you too?
- But I'm not Bansi!
Don't be angry.
Give me half a litre of milk
But I'm not the milkman!
I'm Raj... the astrologer!
So what are you doing here?
Go and look up people's horoscopes
Show Sameer the room.
Come, Sameer...
It's me!
Where's Sameer?
- Here I am, sir
C'mon
For my grandma's eyesight
For my sister's education
For my sister's marriage
Lord, it's Your responsibility to have an operation conducted on grandma's eyes
My sister's education and her marriage is also Your responsibility
Fill up the coffers at the earliest, please
And okay, it's my responsibility to make offerings to You at the temple
O beautiful one...
Come to me
Has Mr Duggal asked you to come and go through the balcony, brother?
No.
- Not your mistake, though
Whoever stays in that house, does take a fall in his lifetime
It's because of the sight ahead.
- You're right
And I wish you keep doing this to me every day
I feel so nice today!
You...?
Already here to pick me up?
I told you to call up and come
No, I can't go with you so early.
Okay, do something
Look around Goa for a couple of days, then we'll leave together
Who is he?
- Our new manager
He'll kill me!
You sent for me, sir?
Are you Suraj?
- No
Suraj Prakash.
- Time for you to set, Suraj (Sun)
You won't ever rise in the morning again
In your 14 years of service, you were never in the night shift
From now on you will work in the night for a month
Sir, I'll die.
- Two months
I'll be ruined, sir.
- Three months
And listen...
- Yes sir?
Sleep is man's worst weakness
And the time between 3 and 5 is the most vulnerable one
If I see your shoulders droop at that time, you are off the roster
I get it
Mr Sameer
When did you get this motorbike?
- My company gave it to me today
No, you got it yesterday.
- Today
You're talking about the motorbike, I'm talking about your eyes
You clapped your eyes on Rani yesterday, right?
Rani?
Who?
I'm watching the kids play
Really?
I'm a gifted astrologer
I've seen your horoscope.
Let me introduce you to Rani
Else, you will keep falling off your window
I'm a priest of Love.
Because of us priests, two hearts meet... a family is made, new babies are born there's no greater joy than this
Her father, the colonel, is a strict man, I hear
He's retired.
He may be pulled up any time
He won't find a better son-in-law.
- Never
He's going to embrace you in the first meeting itself
Bye
Is Ms Rani cross with you?
- No
Then why is she going that way?
Yes, priest?
- Please come here
She's coming
Once you guys shake hands it won't take much time for your hearts to meet
Come...
Be prepared
Haven't seen the colonel for days.
- Our car's in the garage
He's gone to pick it up.
- Ill-fated carburetor, I told him
He must at least fill gas worth 125 but he won't spend more than 25 bucks
Anyway... this is my childhood friend Sameer
Not that we met in childhood...
the two of us met as adults
She's Rani
Sameer is a lifeguard, and Rani is a fashion designer
Won't you shake hands?
Can't you take care of your kid?
What happened?
- A flat tyre?
No, someone got smacked
Who?
- Daddy!
What an introduction!
Who slapped him?
It sounded like an explosion
Are you all right, Papa?
- Don't ask me, dear
It feels as if someone hammered a hot nail into my ear
You shouldn't have hit him so hard.
This boy is naughty
Thank God the colonel applied the brakes in time and saved him
Are you in your senses?
How dare you hit my Papa?
I didn't know he was your father.
And that kid...
What kid?
Her mother is here, there are so many people around... but they didn't utter a word!
You wanted to be a hero, eh?
Stop fighting and take him to a doctor, quick
Conductor?
I need a doctor, dammit!
- That's where we're going
He's gone deaf!
What have you done?
You were to ask Rani's hand from him and you just handed it out to him
Who is Rani, sir?
You?
Are you working day and night?
No sir.
I just came to request you
Please be kind enough and turn my bad nights into good nights, sir
What for?
- Because after office hours... when I go home and shut the doors and windows to catch a wink... the kids around assemble outside my house and scream together...
The matinee show begins now
And my wife takes it out on the kids saying, No shows of late
Sir, my honour is at stake
All right.
Give me some time to think
Really?
How much time?
- Say, a month or two
What?
- When will my duty hours change?
Three months after that
Who is this Rani, sir?
Youth is short
The rest of life is no good
Once... once it's gone... youth never returns
What do you... think about me?
Don't take me for a foe
Be my friend
Lay off.
Let me go
Don't harass me
Sweetheart, so much... of attitude is bad
Youth is short
The rest of life is no good
My love, enjoy... every moment
What you have, is in the present
Tomorrow never comes
I think you are crazy
You and I don't sail in the same boat
I can't just... stop following you
Youth is short
The rest of life is no good
Once... once it's gone... youth never returns
Thank God you're here.
I was really worried
What for?
Aren't we friends now?
Yeah, but your father hasn't forgiven me yet
When things go wrong in the beginning, it all falls in place in the end
I don't get it.
Please explain
I mean, I've brought Papa around and he has called you over for dinner
Really?
Look, he's an army officer who is very punctual
You will be there at nine sharp
I'll be there at eight.
- No way.
Neither early, nor late
You look very happy.
Tommy's sister says, see you at home... as if you're going home to become Tommy's brother-in-law
But to impress Tommy's father, don't forget to buy champagne for him
And, you must uncork it at one go!
Is it Sameer?
- Yes, sir
Come on in.
- Actually sir, I've come to apologise
I committed a mistake the other day.
Please forgive me
I've forgiven you, that is why you are standing before me
Lovely dog
He's Tommy, not a dog
He's like my son.
Remember
Sit
I'm from Patiala, Punjab.
- Really?
My uncle was in the army
Once I took his gun and ran to the fields, for some shooting practice
Enraged, he snatched the gun... and said, It's an official gun
I was so peeved that I joined the army... and I got my own gun
A few years later, war for independence broke out in Goa
They posted me here in Goa
After the war, I settled here with my family
Luckily, I love Goa
Luckily, I love Goa too
What do they call a chicken in Punjab?
- Kukdi
And a girl?
- Kudi
Those medals... did you win them, sir?
My wife wasn't in the army, so obviously they belong to me
Actually sir, your personality unsettles me
That's why I'm talking like a fool
Never mind
And that Chinese pot near the medals...
looks like an antique piece, does it contain Chinese tea?
It contains my late mother's ashes
It gives me a feeling that I always have her blessings with me
You dearly loved your mother.
- I still love her
We tried really hard to save her
But what God wills...
- Let it be, Papa
Let's eat
Why did you have to bring that, son?
It's my first time here.
- Let me uncork it
No, sir.
Let me have the pleasure
And to you, beautiful lady
What have you done?
What have you done?
Shut up!
It all happened because of you
Because of me, really?
- You asked me to uncork it at one go
I asked you to open the bottle, not to break the pot of ashes
Good that the pot broke.
At least it has set his mother's soul free
I think the colonel is insane
Oh no... he's a very intelligent man
Intelligent, my foot!
Mother's ashes ought to be immersed in the Ganges
No one keeps it at home.
Never in a pot, at that!
It's okay, we'll talk later.
- Let me clear this now
Please try to see it from my point of view
Why don't you try to see it from my point of view?
Have you seen the colonel?
He looks as if he grew old twenty years back
Look at his wife... as if she has just stepped into youth
Tell me, from what angle does Rani look like the colonel's daughter?
Yeah, Tommy does appear to be his son
I can't explain that.
You should be asking the person concerned
Who?
- Rani
The colonel would never reveal the secret to Rani
The other day I spared you because it was only a mistake
But today, you intentionally...
You hit my Papa on his face... still I forgave you.
But today you've hurt me in the heart
Can you explain?
- Rani...
Did you intend to say that my father didn't sire me?
No!
- That my mother is wanton?
No!
It was tough convincing myself that you are a nice person
And you, priest!
I'm really surprised
How could you consider such a lowly man a friend?
Let alone respect someone, he hardly knows what respect means
See?
She is hurt because of you!
- Because of me, really?
I was only kidding.
When you knew Rani was standing behind me... why didn't you tell me?
- I was telling you... see from my point of view!
- Your language is too tough for me
For all the mistakes you commit, you pass the buck on to me!
God!
Ball?
What happened?
- A flat tyre?
No, someone got thrashed
Who?
- Papa!
Granny!
I'm ill-fated, it's writ.
Reading my horoscope won't turn things around
Just checking what's worse is in store.
- What...?
Your past was your golden period.
- Golden period, really?
Yes.
Your future is worse.
- Worse than what I'm going through?
Jupiter's place is right up here.
Yours is down in hell
The Moon's place is in the 7th house.
Yours is homeless
Moreover, Saturn is about to enter
You said, Saturn left me last week.
- And it did
Usually, once it leaves, Saturn never returns for another seven years
Not in your case.
Saturn is about to re-enter in a few seconds time
Right, anything is possible with me.
- Saturn is on its way
And it will wreck me.
- This Saturn is going to... change your life and destiny.
It will come like a tempest
What say, dude?
He's going to steal the princess away
As per my calculations, it will stay with you in your room... and knock at Rani's door
Hello uncle
Hello, I say.
Remember me?
I'm your distant relative.
Sunny
For miles away, uncle has no relatives.
Go away
Uncle, your servant is ill-mannered.
Ask him not to mess with me
Why is he so quiet?
- Not that he is glad to remain quiet
He's ailing.
- Shut up
Uncle, I'm Sunny.
Mr Khurana's son
Who...
Khur... ana?
Who Khurana?
- Back in Gurudaspur... this road in front of your house...
- There's one in front of every house it turns around the corner.
- They all turn.
No road is straight
And where does it go?
Straight to his friend's house
Friend?
Who?
- Mr Khosla
He just said Khurana!
- How smart!
You caught me
I was only testing you.
Know what?
When I asked your address... everyone said there's only one decent and honest boy in Goa.
You
Boy...?
What a fraud!
Tell me honestly, why are you here?
- Well, I... want to hire a room
No, he says.
Go away
No way, get lost, he says.
Look, he's pissed off
Now tell me.
- Stay here
Well, now that you are dumb, you won't pick up a fight
So let's go to my relative's place.
- Relative, aunt?
Then who am I?
Who are you?
- Sunny
Not Sunny, he's Shani (Saturn).
- Shut up, dude
Uncle, for my sake don't tell aunt where I come from
Well, uncle himself doesn't know where he comes from
Aunt, I'm a tenant here.
Here's 10,000 bucks
Take another 9,999... take care
I'm a bit tired.
Show me to my room, please
Let me see you off at the next street.
- Ass!
...Hold this.
Bring it upstairs
Oldie's got a nice room.
- Yes
But we are sharing it
What are you staring at me for?
- Why share?
We'll be exchanging beds
We'll also sleep in the same bed, as brothers...
Don't touch me.
I don't like it
Like the rent, we share the room too.
This side is yours, that's mine
All right, give me a hug.
- No!
I don't hug men.
- Really?
How vain
Whatever.
- Okay listen... why don't you take your God there?
- God doesn't belong to one person
God belongs to everyone.
And listen, we've shared the room... not the walls.
God's not moving.
- And where do I stick my posters?
Wherever you wish.
God's not moving
I got an idea.
Stick them up in the bathroom
Why do you get so angry?
- Am I angry?
Now!
Even while you are talking.
- Yeah, where am I angry?
Look, the room's got hot.
Need to open the window
Don't open the window!
Why?
- She comes there
I need to check her out then.
Since I pay half the rent...
I'll open half the window
You're on my half, let me embrace you!
- Don't piss me off!
I tried my best to keep him off
What a sight!
Mr Sameer deliberately kept the door shut to keep me off
But smelling a scent from a distance is my forte
What a dish!
- Don't you say that!
Does she mean anything to you?
- No.
But decent folks stay here
By the way she is a nice and decent girl
And she's a colonel's daughter.
He will shoot you if he hears you
For a beauty like her, I'd take a bullet on my chest
On my chest
Idiotic!
Don't you jump!
- Why not?
You are in bad times, as it is
For all your good intentions, you might fall on top of the colonel
He's going in.
- No.
As per my calculations...
Tommy will have a go at him
He's gone inside.
- Not to worry.
My calculations say... the colonel will kick him out in a minute
What's your name?
- Tommy
Nice name.
My respects, uncle
Who are you?
What do you want?
- I just wanted to meet you, uncle
I'm new here.
I'm told that you are the only decent and honest boy around
Boy?
- What else?
Look at you
You can put any young man to shame.
Besides... hang on.
What's that in your ears?
And what's around your neck, bro?
Don't ask me.
My blood boils when I think of it
Screwed my calculations!
What are you doing?
- Worry not.
I have fixed many bones
And it's only a sprain.
Look straight... here goes
What say?
How do you feel?
Be honest.
- Feels nice
Where are you staying?
- At your neighbour Mr Duggal's place
The one who broke my neck also stays there
Don't be angry.
I'm his roommate.
I know he's ill-mannered... and he'll surely change, but this is not how one should treat an elder
A ball hit me, by mistake
Darling, what's happening?
When did you employ a masseur?
From today.
- Oh no, he's not a masseur, darling
Sunny is a nice boy
He's Mr Duggal's tenant.
- I see
Tell you something, massage is not actually done indoors
A garden, or an open terrace would be just amazing
We have a terrace garden.
- Don't tell me.
Really?
Where?
Upstairs.
- Can I check it out?
Sure
Did he swallow something?
He's dancing... advancing towards the girl
Damn... your love-story began here and ended in the colonel's ears
He began it by shaking hands, and it's going to end in honeymoon
Sir, do something.
Please do something to me
What do I do to you?
- I want a baby
Give me a baby, please!
- What...?
What are you doing here?
- You!
What are you doing here?
You know her?
- She is my wife
Don't you have children?
- Yes, two in fact
Boys, both.
And you know what these boys are like
I want a daughter.
- So why me?
Ask him
Listen... please
What?
- He promised to give me a daughter
After duty hours, he used to get me sweets and flowers... and shut the doors and windows
But ever since you put him on the night shift... the doors and windows only shut to allow him get a good day's sleep
It's a mistake but a mistake is a mistake
You must also have committed a mistake, by mistake, no?
Yes, you are right
And I can understand your problem.
I'll definitely help you
Hang on
From tomorrow, you will buy her sweets and flowers every day
What the...?
Get up
Was I wrong?
500 for grandma, 500 for my sister's studies... 500 for her marriage, and 500...
For my roommate
What a sight!
It's worth paying a hundred thousand in rent
What are you upto?
- Watching the colonel
Really?
- Wanna check?
That's his daughter
Do they look alike?
No way!
And what are you drinking?
Water.
- Really?
I swear by you.
- I see.
Go on
Let me smell it... is this water?
Fenny is Goa's speciality.
It's nothing but cashewnut juice
I see.
I'll juice you!
I'm going to tell Mr Duggal that you are boozing here
Listen...
Don't touch me.
- I won't booze anymore, promise
All right.
- One last swig
What's that?
- Oh, those?
Your God's on my wall, so I glued my goddesses to your wall
So why get angry?
- I'm not angry
You are peeved.
- I'm not
Relax... easy
You feel like abusing me.
- Not at all
I know, you want to tell me something.
- No
You want to hit me.
Go on, hit me.
- No
C'mon, hit me.
- Oh no
Why don't you go to your half?
- Okay.
Peace
Peace
What was that?
Earthquake?
Mr Duggal, where did you pick that roommate from?
He boozes, and... watches Rani through his binoculars, You must go and inform the colonel
Oh, why would you inform the colonel?
The ass has stuffed you with money
Rather I'll go and inform him
Mr Duggal...
looks like he's deaf today
He's deaf
Young man, my neck feels better now
Hello aunt.
- Do something to my ear
Let me fix your neck first.
Fixing the ear is no big deal
It will be all right.
Where's Rani?
See, Rama?
Though they share the same room, they are poles apart
That swine injures me, and the other... the decent one, comes home everyday to give me a massage
Hush, Tommy
Sameer is not around, then who is Tommy barking at?
Dogs have a very sharp memory, uncle
Tommy must be barking at Sameer's thoughts
Where's Rani?
Bloody dog!
Guess what?
You look so happy.
What gives?
- This year, the All India...
Fashion Designers' competition is going to be held in Goa
The designs I had sent have been approved
And I'm participating this year!
Papa, I got to pay the entry fees within two days.
Only 20,000 Rupees
Let her have it.
I'll return every cent after marriage 20,000?
No dear, I can't afford that much
Please Papa, for my sake.
It's very important for my career
Golden opportunities don't knock twice.
Give her the money
Where's the money, son?
I'm a retired colonel
We manage with my pension.
Where do I get 20,000 from?
Selfish father
You upset her
Expenses have already risen this month. 12,000 for the hearing aid 3000 for my neck-collar.
Where do I get 20,000 from?
Why won't you give her?
You still have your eyes... heart, lungs and kidneys intact.
I'll puncture them all
Granny you ask me not to lose my temper!
Tell me, why not?
The colonel won't give Rani the money.
Who will help the poor girl?
I wish I could strangle his...
Granny, I got a solid idea
Postpone your eye surgery.
Let's first help Rani realise her dream.
What say?
Besides, granny, Lord Krishna's birthday is approaching
The Lord is here!
Be careful with your pots, lassies...
So much!
Let it go!
That's not a biscuit
Bloody dog!
Let it go
What's that?
Dearest Rani, I know you want to become a famous fashion designer
I'm sending you money... to help you cross the first hurdle in the path of your progress
Not a favour, just consider it as a gift from a friend
And, if you win the show... you will be happy, but my happiness will be greater than yours
I expect nothing in return for this small help.
Not even thanks
Your well-wisher
How long will you conceal your youth, my love?
How long will you torment the bachelors?
Someday you are going to become someone's bride
Will you marry me?
Will you marry me?
I'll buy you earrings and bangles...
I'll buy you everything, I swear
I'll steal the Moon, I'll even pluck the stars...
I'll make the Sun bow before you, I swear
Someday you will go crazy for me
Will you marry me?
Will you marry me?
The day I come as a bridegroom, I won't go back...
I'll take you away in a palanquin, I swear
I'll steal you away, before everyone
I'll make you my bride, I swear
How long will you show indifference, my love?
Will you marry me?
Will you marry me?
How long will you conceal your youth, my love?
How long will you torment the bachelors?
Someday you are going to become someone's bride
Will you marry me?
Will you marry me?
I will marry you
I will marry you
You never told me you play the guitar so well
What a revelation!
All those lessons in guitar seem worthwhile today
Have a laddoo.
- What's the occasion?
I told you I want to participate in the fashion designing competition
I paid the entry fees today.
- Really?
I'll take two laddoos.
- Why?
One for me and one for my God
Go ahead
Bye
What a shame
Bloody untuned drum!
Did your father ever play a guitar?
Give it here
Papa is... a businessman in Indore
A businessman, really?
And you were playing the guitar, eh?
When did I say that?
The poor girl thought it was me
And you were tongue-tied, no?
You could only grin
Couldn't you say that it was me?
- Am I nuts to tell her that... it wasn't me but it was our master Sameer Malhotra who was playing?
She was so impressed, dude.
And she even saw the posters of your goddesses
Know what she said?
What a shame
You're in my half.
I'll kiss anything that comes my way, I told you
The priest said it right!
You are not Sunny but Shani (Saturn)
Stay away from me
I got my temper under control!
I wish I could tear you apart
He's coming.
- Sunny, haven't I reminded you... to pay the rent?
- I've mailed the address to Daddy
He should be sending the money.
- If it doesn't arrive this time... you will have to leave.
Remember.
- Uncle... did I ever harass you?
Have I ever troubled you, aunt?
Then why don't you clean the railings?
Look...
Pay the rent, we'll clean it daily.
What...?
He's gone.
- You should've told me
Is Mr Duggal in?
- Yes.
So?
There's a letter for Sunny
Sunny stays here, right?
- Yes, dammit!
Go in
Mr Duggal, there's a letter for Sunny
Hey, where are you going?
Give me.
- Two?
Two letters?
Whom is the second letter for?
- Only one!
I asked him to give it
So take it and drive him out.
- I'm going
Move it.
Do you fancy eating and sleeping here?
Has he left?
Okay, read the letter.
- It's for Sunny
Why should we read it?
- Why not?
He's our tenant
We must know what type of a person he is what kind of people write to him
Read
Go on
Let me open it.
- Is it made of steel?
Dearest son, Sunny, ever since you have left, I've been worried
Your planes are grieving.
There's no one to pilot them son, without you, what use are six bunglows and eight factories to me?
I hear, you are staying with a beggar
If you wish to extend your stay, revert back
I'll present a huge bungalow to your landlord
Your Papa
I must leave now.
- Where are you going, son?
Papa hasn't sent money, not even a letter.
How can I stay here?
Did I really offend you?
Do you have a problem here, son?
No, no.
- All I have on me is a fake coin
You guys snatched 10,000 bucks from me and you ask me if I have a problem
10,000?
Just ask me, and I'll give you 10,000 every day
But please don't quit this place
From now on, we'll cook for you.
I'll do your laundry too
Let go of my hand, will you?
And who will wear my underwear?
I will do that.
I'll even give you a bath
But don't ever leave this place.
- Don't ever go, son
Tell you something... somebody has rightly said, if you want true love... stay in a poor man's shanty
Put the binoculars down!
Else, I'll inform the Colonel
Go ahead
Are you boozing?
I told you not to drink, didn't I?
Wait till I tell Mr Duggal.
- Go ahead and tell him
You wait here!
Mr Duggal!
Who the hell...?
Are you boozing here?
- D'you want me to sit on the roof?
What if I fall down?
- You're drunk
I can't...!
You are blind now, I'll talk to you in the morning
Makes no difference.
I've been blind since morning
Don't mind the poor fellow.
Here, grab your bottle
Here you are.
- See?
That's a tenant
And you never treated me even to a cup of tea
He's helping me live it up, you know.
- Where is he taking you?
Oh, I forgot!
We got to meet Bijli!
Let's go
Come on.
Not there... this way
Don't go.
It's a bad habit.
- Don't go, my foot!
Clear the litter, will you?
- He tells me to clear the litter
Don't do it.
It's my house.
Who is he to give orders?
I'm going to throw it away!
- Pick it up and throw it outside!
Here goes!
Bloody...!
Who got smashed?
- Who?
The Colonel
Who hit him?
- Brother Sameer
Our friendly neighbourhood hunter.
He's hunted many a colonel down!
You are in my half, let me kiss you
Go, neck Bijli!
Rani, once again, forgive me
Neck Bijli, you will be forgiven
The thorn
Oh, the piercing thorn
Come, my love
Behind your bungalow, under the berry tree... my love... a thorn pierced me
Now that you are in trouble, you wonder... why you couldn't stay without me
Your friends were right when they said... you will be trapped someday
Get that?
I'm sorry... let bygones be bygones
Save my heart this time, my love
Your clothes are skimpy... even the blindman says, show it to me
Show it
Get lost
Move it
Another 15,000?
What for?
I have already paid 20,000
That was entry fees. 15,000 is entertainment tax
You should've told me before.
The show is at hand, how can I raise...?
Entertainment tax is a government policy.
Everybody knows that
If you don't pay by evening, you cannot do the show tomorrow
Why can't she?
She is my Rani
Don't weep... please don't
You will do the show
I promise you, you will do the show
Sis, I just heard that the government says... it's illegal to get a girl married before she turns 21
Which means you have three more years to go, sis
And your sister-in-law has only three days
Why don't you concentrate on your studies for the next three years?
Shall I break the pot?
Thank you, dear sister
Still short of 5000!
I'm seriously stressed now
You got to help me now, God
That was for my sister's studies!
You could've broken Your piggy bank
Come here... do you know her?
Hot, eh...?
You're throwing kisses at your sisters...?
I can't figure out what to say
Many people are responsible for this dream come true
But there is someone I want to specially thank
I don't know his name, nor do I recognise him
I've never met him, but he's the anonymous friend... who helped me out when I needed support the most
He calls himself my well-wisher
I appeal to him.
If you can hear me... please come and meet me.
I'd like to personally thank you
My dear God, grandma always says that a princess will come into my life
But not even a maid-servant has come into it till today
But I feel today as if the Princess will surely come
God, don't mess up things.
I love her too much
I'd have called her home, but Sunny's around, you see?
So I've called her here.
Nothing wrong, is there?
Nothing wrong.
Everything you've done is good
I've heard it all Sameer.
That which you tried to say... and also that which you didn't say.
You did so much for me... and didn't even let me know?
You shall pine at heart, my love... by God, you too shall fall in love
At heart, I shall desire you too
by God, I hope I fall in love too
You're charming... you're my love, you're my romance
I'm bowled over... yes, I acknowledge that
I know, your love is full of mischief
But I can't help it, my heart just won't agree
How I wish I rule your heart
By God, may you fall in love too
They call me beautiful, they call me the proud one... and you've gone crazy; you have no control over your heart
I'm no less crazy.
I'm not conceding defeat
I'm here to steal your heart, and steal it, I will
How I wish I begin to trust you
By God, I hope I fall in love too
May you begin to pine at heart
By God, may you fall in love too
God!
What a sweet dream!
Make it come true, please!
Here she is!
By the way, You've done a great job in making her, God
Sunny...?
Can't be!
God, why's he...?
Sunny!
You...?
Which means you're the well-wisher...?
I didn't want to say it.
But I knew... you'd get to know some day.
- But...
Stop necking him!
Give me the hug!
He's a fraud!
You... my...?
Rani!
Rani!
Don't go with him!
I'm me...
I'm not him!
I'm the one she loves.
Leave her alone!
God!
Make him see reason!
Let go of her cheek, you scoundrel!
Rani, I'm the real one!
I'm not him!
Out of the way, Colonel!
Step aside!
What...?
Step up...?
Out of the way!
Out!
What happened...?
Who got smashed?
The Colonel got smashed!
Sunny, don't be shy, have some more.
Eat to your fill
The milk reminds me of home
This is your home too.
- Absolutely
We can't ever forget what you have done for our Rani
And you didn't even let me know.
- Ma always says... your left hand must not know what your right hand does
Hear that?
Such lofty ideals!
- Pickles!
I don't know where they are
Not pickles, ideals, darling.
- Ideals, I see
They are poles apart.
One is an angel while the other is a demon
The more distance I keep from him, the closer he gets to deal a blow
With a football, when I'm at home.
With a bottle, when I'm outside
When I'm walking on the footpath he calls me in the middle of the road... and rams his motorbike into me
Be careful.
Say it again, Sameer
Colonel, I'm sorry, I've been a bloody fool
Accept these flowers and please forgive me
Okay, I forgive you
Where does the Colonel get his voice?
- God knows
Where did he transpire from?
Wake up!
We are here
Who is this sleepy character?
- A security guard
He tried to mess with me, I put him on a three-months' night shift
No wonder he brings his wife to make an appeal to you
Uncle!
How are you, dear niece?
- You've pulled down!
Can't tell you what I've been through
Rani's uncle?
This man could've been your Cupid... but you've already plunged him into the darkness
Brother-in-law, you are wrapped all over in bandages?
What happened?
Sunny, he is my wife's brother
Swine!
Where have you been all this while?
Brother, I'm cross with you.
We live in the same city, yet... you haven't been here for months.
- What city, sister?
I don't even get to see my wife.
- What does that mean?
This new manager, the swine, has put me on night shift since two months
He sleeps during the daytime, and stays up like an owl during the nights
He's suffering from constipation and acidity
Look at the dark circles below his eyes
That's fine, but who's that scoundrel?
That's fine, but who are you?
- Uncle, he is Sunny.
Our neighbour
I see.
Glad to meet you.
- We'll meet later
You were talking about some manager...
- Don't even mention the swine
What has he done?
- He's made life miserable for me
What's his name?
- Bloody Saturn!
Shut up
Sameer
Uncle, our Sameer.
Your neighbour.
My roommate Sameer
What...?
Sameer stays in the neighbourhood?
Which beggar in the neighbourhood?
- Not a beggar, it's Sameer
One who wrecked you!
Now he's after him
That swine is after my whole family
Time's not favourable, Sameer
Forget the flowers, forget the colonel, placate the uncle
Uncle...
The tables have turned.
Now watch the fun
Uncle, aunt...
I've got some presents for you
Skirt and blouse for you
Bush shirt for you, uncle
Sweets for the kids
Also some fruits for the two of you
I hope you don't expect these things to bear fruit?
Oh no, of course not
Uncle, if by any chance I have uttered something wrong... please forgive me.
I've realised that I've been unfair to you
You are off the night shift.
- What...?
Then how about tonight...?
- Sure
Son-in-law...
- Son-in-law...?
Son-in-law, indeed.
The other day when I asked you about Rani... had you answered me, you'd have been married by now
And I would be your uncle
Uncle, a mistake is committed by mistake
You must also have committed a mistake, by mistake, no?
Aunt, am I wrong?
- You are absolutely right, son-in-law
Greetings.
- Greetings.
Come in
Colonel sahib...
- You!
Don't you dare step inside!
Stay where you are
Colonel sahib, consider it my bad luck or my karma... for all my good intentions, things invariably go wrong... and I end up hurting you.
- 5000 people live around here
Of all, why do you always choose to hurt me?
Colonel sahib, the new year is about to set in, in a few hours time
With the passing year, let bygones be bygones, please
I beg your forgiveness
D'you take me for a coward?
Remember, I'm a soldier
I kept forgiving you because I considered you a kid
Not anymore
Get this loud and clear
Henceforth, for 50 metres around me... if I see you, or see you throwing anything... the last time I fired my gun was against the Portuguese... this time it's going to be you
Yes, colonel sahib
Happy happy new... handcuffs
Is this a new way to wish a new year?
- I'll tell you
Where's Charles?
Charles?
Or Sameer?
- Sameer?
Is he a new kid in the Charles gang?
Have women joined Charles' gang too?
There's no aunty here!
Oh, this one?
What's the problem in his pants?
- Today he's become a police officer
Become, eh?
Tell me something... you're an honest officer's wife, how do you know such criminals?
I'm not a criminal, ask you neighbour if you wish
Who neighbour?
The retired soldier?
Now I get it.
After retirement he's been sheltering criminals
Let me go.
Rani is waiting for me.
- Waiting for what?
To murder someone?
To loot a bank?
Or to print fake stamp papers?
- What the hell...?
Boy, you are going to rot here until the police van arrives
Then you'll go to jail.
Come on, don't stare at him
The ass who smashed his head is on the loose, and I'm trapped here
Am I wearing a convict's clothes?
Am I going to meet Rani in 2010?
Ladies and gentleman... and friends, let me show you another magical act
Look, this is magic
Forgive me, Mr Magician, but pulling out a bouquet from a cloth... a pigeon from a turban and a rabbit from a box is quite simple
I'll believe you if you can cast a spell on me
He's challenging me
All right, boy, it's no big deal.
Lie down on the bench
Sure.
That's no big magic
No, but it's going to be
Friends, now my magic wand is going to suspend this boy in thin air
If a stick can make someone float in the air... no one would care to buy air tickets.
They would be waiting for the stick
I'm an astrologer, you see.
- Before you stands a magician, fool
C'mon, lie down!
- At your service
Windbag!
Here I go
Abracadabra!
Let the boy float in air
Don't mess with a magician!
Or, you will stay suspended in air
Magician, I believe you now
I fear, I might go right up there
I pray, put me down
All right
How he lifted him up, we didn't even get to know
This girl wouldn't believe me
Rani, your arm on my shoulder is one pretty sight
Let me make it simple for you, Sameer
Stay 50 metres away from Papa and 500 metres away from me.
You dig?
I'll show you guys a wonder now
You... please come here
Me...?
- Don't go!
He'll put you in a box... and hack you to pieces...
One boy.
Any one, please
Mr Magician, there's a boy!
Strong, rough, tough and reliable
Seize your chance before Sunny arrives.
Go!
Come this side, please.
- No, I'm fine here
Please come here
If he is in, I'm off.
Find someone else
Hang on, lady
Rather I'd leave
I get it
The two of you are cross with each other.
All right...
I'll turn the enmity into friendship.
- Can you do that?
Of course, and I'll turn your hatred into love
Hang on.
Your name?
- Rani
And you are...?
- Sameer
So, Sameer and Rani... the two of you are man and wife from now on
And tonight, is your first New Year night
Tell everyone how much you love each other
What are you staring at?
- Admiring you
Had you not traipsed into my life, I'd have been a nobody
I'd have been an anklet sans the chime
I'd have been a soleless shoe
A heartless body
If not for you, Rani...
- Not Rani... call me Mrs Sameer Malhotra
To be honest, I fell in love with you at first sight
I have endured so much to possess you
Don't torment me anymore.
Come...
Well...
I can wait no longer either
Your beloved seeks your heart
Come to me, my love
Profess your love
Give in to me, my love
I'm pining, so are you
I'm waiting for you
Profess your love
Give in to me, my love
Your charms... like the tempest, my love
Your looks... my identity, my love
Gaze into my eyes
Make me belong to you
Profess your love
Give in to me, my love
You have done me a favour
You are in my dreams... you are all I desire
Let's make a legend of love
Come my love, make me go crazy in your love
Profess your love
Give in to me, my love
Your beloved seeks your heart
Come to me, my love
Profess your love... give in to me, my love
Come to me, my love
Give in to me, Sweetheart
The Prince has fallen in love with the Princess...
Sameer, I've been thinking.
- What?
You can play the guitar, paint, sing... you're quite a multi-talented man.
- Guess why?
That's because I'm me.
Not you!
Having a ball, aren't you?
- You have a great talent too
What?
- You tell lies to fool people!
Listen, make a portrait for me too
Don't mind, but I paint only beautiful people!
Know what?
- What, what?
I'm in a great mood today.
Say what you want to
You aren't as innocent as you appear to be
Why?
How you brought Rani around in just two hours last night
Weren't you jealous!
As close as you get to her, I want to get closer to her too
Aren't you jealous?
Aren't you?
What's your problem?
My problem is that I want to score with my friend's girlfriends... it makes me very happy!
When I get married, I want you to paint me and my wife together
You know, with her at my side.
And I lying down in her lap
She in black-and-white, I in colour...
Sure, I will
Whom are you marrying?
Bijli?
No, it's Rani
Aren't you jealous?
Aren't you?
See?
Your temper hurts you yourself, doesn't it?
If it wasn't for the oath, I'd have squeezed him out like the tube!
Where's Sameer?
- The brush!
Get to be the master's disciple!
Quick!
Life's a dream...
Who...?
Rani, you...?
You can even paint!
- Well, I...
My painting...?
How sweet!
Tears and desires, that's how it is
You're quite a revelation, Sunny.
- No revelation
Painting, singing, the guitar...
No wonder they call you multi-talented
Sameer's multi-talented too
You ought to have seen him at the party last night
The way he sang and danced...
I've been teaching him classical dancing and he's into rock?
Anyway, fresh orange juice for the two of you.
Where's he?
He's in the latrine right now
He'll take some time.
You can wait.
- No thank you
Give him some and you have some too.
Happy New Year
Was Rani here?
- Yes, she was
You'll now ask me if even my father has even done any painting
And I'll say, my Papa's a very big businessman in Indore
You'll say, Liar, dog...
- That you really are
Your dream of making Rani fall in love with you will remain a pipe dream
It won't be a pipe dream.
Because I know what your weakness is
Really?
What is it?
You can never tell Rani that you love her
So listen!
I swear it on my grandma!
I will profess my love to Rani in the presence of the whole world today!
And I swear it on my father in Indore too
I'm the one who'll bring Rani to this house, as a bride
If my love is true, I'll be the one who'll marry Rani
And if I'm determined enough, I'll lead her here by the hand
For me.
You are Rani's brother
No brother.
I'm her lover
Rani, you think this lover-boy is an accomplished singer and painter
I'll expose him to you today
C'mon, sweetheart, let's go
This juice Rani brought for you I'll have it
Hold it!
Who did she bring it for?
- For you
So I'll drink it!
Share it with me!
I can't share anything of Rani's!
May you find it bitter!
I find everything of Rani's to be sweet
At least let out a burp!
I'll paint a picture and also sing a song... and expose Sunny.
Okay?
What new ailment is this?
One Duggal is difficult to tolerate
Three, five...?
More than I can endure!
Where do you think you're going?
Stop there!
Lie down here, Rani.
I'll put them to bed and return
C'mon!
Eagle!
I'm going to make you a seagull!
Senior!
Swat this fly!
You've made a mistake by messing with the Eagle Gang!
One Sunny I can't tolerate.
And six of them walk up to me!
I'm going to thrash all six of them!
C'mon!
Tommy!
Come here!
Come!
You always bark at me, don't you?
So bark now... bark!
The next time you bark, you're going to disappear.
You get that...?
Take care of your kids and your dogs!
I'll spare you this time.
Next time, you're gone
Tommy, my son, don't keep going outside
There are bad people in the locality
Have I ever raised my voice with you?
Have I?
And how Sameer was yelling at you yesterday!
The insolent chap!
Go and play in the house, son.
And don't go out... my good son!
Tommy!
Tommy...
Tommy, where have you gone?
You ought to have considered what would happen to me without you!
Darling, we too are sad that Tommy's gone missing
But how long will you keep starving, thinking about him?
Let's eat, Papa.
I'm hungry too
No, my child.
I don't feel like it
Colonel...
I've looked everywhere in Goa, but there's no trace of Tommy
I don't know where he has gone.
Could someone have kidnapped him?
But who could be Tommy's enemy?
Mr Duggal!
That's it
No... he hasn't been around since yesterday
Sameer...?
- Why Sameer?
No, can't be Sameer.
But he could do a thing like this too.
Remember his public threat?
That he'd make the dog disappear!
If the dog barks, I'll kill him, I'll finish him!
No way, he was drunk.
- Really...?
But who then...?
He's the culprit!
Who is it?
That scoundrel has broken me in every part of my body!
I don't know what revenge he is extracting from me... by having Tommy separated from me!
Sameer!
Where are you hiding, you thief?
This is a warning!
If you don't return Tommy to me in 24 hours...
I'll have you sent to jail!
I still hold sway among the cops.
I'm not sparing you!
What does that mean?
- He has influence
Give him the dog!
May the worms get you!
What new fuss is this...?
Have your father treated
Why'd I have my brother-in-law kidnapped anyway?
Why...?
Where am I going to look for this dog now?
You have a variety of dogs
- Hush!
Don't call them dogs.
They take offense
I've brought them up like my own children
That's Rustom, that's Sohrab.
Eats less, snarls all the time
That's Cyrus.
Faithful.
But eats and enjoys a good life
And that is...
This is the dog I want.
Do you have it?
I do have it!
That's my boy, Tin Tin!
Say hello!
Quite a good boy.
But once he loses his temper... he's going to bite.
And remember... don't ever give him a cold bath
But this one doesn't have a black spot.
- Don't worry!
Here's the solution!
Mr Colonel...
look who's here
Tommy!
My son...!
Where had you gone away to?
Where did you find him, Sameer?
- The poor chap... was sitting by a lamp-post, shivering.
He used to always bark at me
But this time, he said, Papa...
and went for my feet
He appeared to be telling me, Please take me to my Papa
Papa...?
- You
Oh yes!
He's like my son, of course!
Papa, it's because of Sameer that we have Tommy back today
You must forgive him at least now.
- Sure, I forgive him!
Rama, lay the table
What's happening here?
Look at this, Sunny!
Tommy's back today because of Sameer
Look me in the eye, my brother!
Where did you find the dog...?
Where did you find it?
I went mad looking for it!
For Rani's sake, look into my eyes!
Where did you find the dog?
Tell me!
Sunny, I don't know what's gotten into my Tommy
He's been behaving like a stranger ever since he has returned
He seems to have changed.
- He has stayed with the stray dogs
I know a cure!
Squeeze him in a bucket of cold water!
Squeeze him?
- I mean, give him a cold bath
Oh, I see.
All right
Please sit down.
- Won't you give Tommy a bath?
No!
I'll first give Tommy a bath.
I'll have breakfast later
The breakfast will get cold, papa.
- I'll be back soon, my child
Let's take a bath, Tommy boy!
- Where's Sameer?
Sunny, please call Sameer, will you?
- Not me, he sleeps till late
He'll hit me for no reason.
You go and call him instead
All right, I'll call him
We shall overcome...
Who is it?
Are you asleep, Sameer?
Wake up!
Sunny, don't change your voice and bother me!
Let me sleep!
Rani...?
One second.
I'll be out there
Who are you...?
Who on earth are you?
- Bijli
But who...?
- It's Rani
One moment, Rani.
I'm coming!
What are you doing here?
What?
- What are you doing here?
I was sleeping with you
I came to call you for breakfast
I've said nothing!
I'll join you in two seconds!
Go away!
- Where?
Want me to come...?
- Go away!
Give that to me?
- What?
That one.
- What?
I'm coming inside
God!
I'm so sorry, Rani.
How disgusting!
What you think is wrong, Rani!
- How about what I see?
This one...?
It's not mine.
It's hers!
I've done nothing wrong, Rani.
Please try to understand...
You...
I'll fix you!
Rani...
That piece of thorn
I swear it on you, Rani!
I don't know that girl!
How could you with a girl you don't know...?
I swear, I don't even know her!
- Without knowing them... will you call just about any girl?
- Listen to me, Rani...
You've started getting girls into your bed now!
This is too much, Rani!
Listen to me!
Hey girl, can't you hear what boss is saying to you?
Do just as the boss says.
Okay?
Else the Eagle Gang will catch you and present you to the boss, okay?
What are you guys saying?
- Command us, boss!
No one dares oppose you!
Do what you want to.
Here on the streets!
Go for her!
Grab her!
Grab her...?
- No, I won't
This was all that was left!
You're a loafer.
And a drunkard!
You're a womaniser!
Now you're leader of the Eagle gang!
I'm not the leader.
- Shame on you, Sameer!
Forget her, boss.
There's one better than the other in Goa
Point out a girl.
She'll be in your arms
After a nice cold bath...
Tommy will become a handsome boy
He'll be good looking.
Those dirty dogs in the lane...?
Don't ever play with them, okay?
See how dirty you are
Good boy!
Good boy!
Bravo...
What's this?
A black dye?
So this isn't my Tommy!
Hey... are you a wild dog?
Rama!
The dog has bitten me!
Rama!
It isn't our Tommy!
It's a duplicate of Tommy!
Sameer has given us a wild dog!
The black dye came off when I was giving it a bath!
Look!
I'm not sparing Sameer!
He's made the dog bite me!
God!
He acts like a butcher!
After beating him black and blue he's now setting the dogs after him!
He has no respect for his elders!
He'll need to take 14 injections in the stomach now
Go and take the first one.
- Go on...
Tiny injections they'll give him
Sameer, I'm Raj, the astrologer
Here you are!
And I've been looking for you all over Goa
I'm looking for Sameer, too.
Let me know if you find him
I want to break his limbs!
- No... liquor isn't good for you!
- It's blessed wine
Look!
Rani and Sunny...
No!
It isn't Rani!
It's someone else
Really?
Very well
With you, I'll work wonders, O beautiful one
With you, I'll work wonders, O beautiful one
Let's rock to the music, O beautiful one
How shall you have me...?
The whole world craves me
The sight of you has driven me out of my mind, O beautiful one
Watch the wonders this boy is going to work, O beautiful one
Come into my arms...
I'll show you the way to love
Take over my heart... you'll be my life itself
I'm at war with myself, my blouse is getting tighter... answer the questions that rise in my heart, beautiful one
Watch the wonders this boy is going to work, O beautiful one
I'm one crazy man... who's not in his senses
Feed it to my lips... all the venom you possess
It's a trap laid by my beauty
It's beyond comparison
Having found you, I shall overcome, my love
Watch the wonders this boy is going to work, O beautiful one
With you, I could work wonders, O beautiful one
Let's rock to the music, O beautiful one
How shall you have me?
The whole world covets me
The sight of you drives me out of my senses, O beautiful one
Watch the wonders this boy is going to work, O beautiful one
Stop it, stop it...
Rickety old rickshaw!
- That'll be 40 rupees, ma'am
Here you are.
- But this is 20 Rupees
Every senior citizen gets a discount of 50 per cent
Whether it's the bus or a railway train
Besides, yours is a rickety old rickshaw!
Grandma!
Grandma is here!
Look at this kid!
He's calling me a grandma!
Sameer...
- Grandma, don't call Sameer
He's a bad boy!
- Why?
He ran away with my chocolate yesterday
And today, I will run away with your glasses!
Give my glasses to me!
- I'm running away... come after me!
My glasses...
- What's happening here?
Make this old fossil see reason, please
But he's my husband.
- What!
No, I'm her son!
- Son?
She's my Mummy!
Mummy, ask grandma to get me a chocolate!
My darling son, give my glasses to me
On one condition.
- What?
We'll play Cricket with it.
- I can't see anything!
I'll toss it up like a ball.
You must catch it
Everyone in Rani's family hates me.
That includes her dog, Tommy
Grandma, that's your grandson's love story then
Now you tell me what I am to do.
- My son... why must you worry?
Now that I have arrived, everything will be all right
Just show me the girl once.
I'll go and talk it over with her, okay?
Come, I'll show you.
- My son!
That's Rani, grandma
Where, son...?
- Over there, grandma
She's right there
Yes, yes...
- Isn't she beautiful?
Absolutely beautiful!
But I can't see a thing!
You go to the office and get on with your work, my son
I'll go to her house and talk it over, okay?
Okay, grandma.
- Bye, son
My child...
- I'm here, ma'am
What spell have you cast on Sameer?
- What?
He's madly in love with you!
You're the only one he talks about, in everything he does
What are you talking about?
You know the Colonel...
My child, I know the Colonel is very angry with Sameer
Once you agree to the wedding... the Colonel will have to get out of your way!
My child, do not be afraid.
If you're in love with Sameer... not the Colonel and not any power in the world can separate you both!
Sameer?
And Rama?
My grandson will give you the bliss the Colonel never could
If you're afraid of the Colonel, I'll help the two of you elope!
Sameer hasn't come yet.
I wonder what's up
He'll come, grandma
Here he is.
- Grandma...
Have you talked it over, grandma?
- Oh yes, son.
I have very good.
Has Rani agreed?
- Yes, Rani has agreed
You now need to talk to her mother and she'll bring the Colonel around
Make an eleven rupee offering.
And that'll be it!
Grandma!
That's water!
The coffee's in this one here!
Ever since my glasses have broken I can't see a single thing, my son
Grandma, how could you have spoken to Rani then?
One uses his mouth to speak, my son.
Not one's eyes
You must've chosen right.
- Sure
How many fingers, grandma?
- Four
Three... two...
- Grandma!
I'm not totally blind yet, son.
I can still see a bit
And why must you worry?
Go and talk it over with Rani's mother
Sameer!
Let me have your glasses fixed, ma'am
In just a little while, we'll reach your in-laws' house
And here we are!
Praise the Colonel!
- What are you doing?
Holy water from St. Peter's church.
Go on.
Neither is the old man there nor is your future wife.
Go and talk it over with your future mother-in-law!
Will she listen to me?
- Of course
Just latch the door from inside!
- Why?
Neither will she go out, nor will she send you out
Once the matter is settled, unlatch the door.
Very simple
Go on.
I'm right here!
Sameer... why are you latching the door?
So that you don't send me out of the house... nor leave the house yourself
Was this the time for this angel of death to return...?
What you're doing is wrong, Sameer
Is falling in love wrong?
I ask you... have you never been in love?
- Well, I...
You have, haven't you?
So why all the restrictions in my love?
Now look, Sameer.
You...
Sameer!
Where's Sameer?
He's in there, with your wife
- What...?
You can't go inside till Sameer's work is over
Till Sameer's work is done...?
Give me an opportunity.
I have so much to give in love!
I beg you, Sameer.
Please go away
No.
Unless you agree, I can't go away lt'll take only two minutes.
Let him do it, Colonel!
I'll see what he's upto!
Colonel!
Why're you so scared even after grandma has spoken to you?
The Colonel used to be a colonel.
And you are the colonel of this family
If you say yes, what can the colonel do about it?
For God's sake, leave my sari alone!
Let them get on with it!
If the youngsters run away, who'll lose face...?
Who'll get a bad name...?
- Get lost!
Your sari's stuck
Don't worry.
I'll have it freed
Look at the evil man!
What's on your mind, my child?
Like you folks think
Nothing happened...
Sameer didn't misbehave with me
I thought very hard over it
What I feel is... he had come to talk about you
He's madly in love with you.
What about you?
Is it Sameer?
Or Sunny?
I don't understand, Mama
Sunny is a nice guy
I like Sameer too.
But Papa hates him
I'm in a dilemma.
- Look, my child... don't worry about mine and your father's likes
Decide for yourself
I'm finding it difficult to decide
What you got to gauge is, who loves you the most...
Sameer, or Sunny
And if you are still confused, leave it to God
My red veil... flutters in the flowing wind
And my beloved casts glances at me... on the sly
I know he will love me... but he'll make my life miserable
Red veil... your red veil... flutters in the flowing wind
Your red veil flutters in the flowing wind
And your beloved casts glances at you... on the sly
I'll give you my heart...
I'll even die for you
For all my efforts to hide my pretty face... it hardly took time for the cruel breeze... to break my resolve
Your moon-like face has cast a spell all around
The sight of you... puts even the moon to shame
I'm coy.
- Goodness me
I'm apprehensive.
- Goodness me
Come into my arms, let not this opportunity go wasted
Your beloved has already seen you... on the sly, though
I'll give you my heart...
I'll even die for you
I know he will love me... but he'll make life miserable for me
This fragrant ambience... invites us to make love
My pretty love... give in to your beloved
The fragrance of your love... has merged into my breath
Here, my love, I give up everything...
I give in to you
You are desirous...
- Goodness me you admit.
- Goodness me
No stopping me now...
I'm unstoppable
My beloved has seen me... on the sly
I know he will love me... but he'll make life miserable for me
I'll give you my heart...
I'll even die for you
My red veil... flutters in the flowing wind
Your red veil... flutters in the flowing wind
And your beloved casts glances at you... on the sly, though
I know he will love me... but he'll make my life miserable
I'll give you my heart...
I'll even die for you
My son, you came here in quest of peace
Where will you go now?
- I'll go to a place... where there are no people at all.
The Andaman-Nicobar islands
You'll clash with a guy even if he's the only one around in town
Do what you will, but you can't change your destiny
I know how much you love Rani, my son
Will you leave her also and go away?
I'm not happy to leave
I have to go away.
That's how the situation is
Let's go, grandma.
It's time the boat sailed
Look after yourself.
- Sameer... well, well!
The priest, if not Rani, what say?
What's up?
- I'm leaving
Hey!
You can't leave me and go away
Not you alone.
I'm leaving this world behind
You've only seen Rani and me getting together
Won't you stay for the wedding?
Guess who played the biggest role in bringing Rani and me together?
He kept making mistakes and she kept getting closer to me
Oh yes, that's a solid idea you gave me!
Of publicly proposing to Rani!
Incidentally, India and Pakistan are playing a cricket match today
I've invited her father.
Rani will be there too
I'm thinking of saying it to her in public!
Rani, will you marry me?
You're lucky... because I've stopped dreaming about Rani
Enjoy yourself
Fights, brawls, show of temper... and proposing to girls are things real men do
I'd rather you play the guitar, Sameer
Today's match is going to be a terrific affair... because, for the first time, we have the Indian and Pakistani teams... playing a friendly match in this stadium in Goa today
Paa-ji's here!
Get out of the way!
Where do you think you're going?
Get out!
Who's that in the stadium?
He's grabbed the mike from Pa-ji
I'll...
Rani!
Where are you?
He's come here, looking for Rani!
Who's Rani?
What's he shouting Rani for?
Who's she?
It has to do with the heart.
Keep it up, brave lad!
Go for her!
Looks like it has to do with love
Rani...
listen to me...
Where're you hiding, sis-in-law?
The boss is so upset!
He'll find her.
He sure will.
- Sis-in-law!
Rani... where are you?
You mess with my mike?
You fight with me?
Rani!
All I'll say is that you mustn't marry Sunny!
He's not worthy of you!
It's a question of your life!
Hold it, hold it... he has something to say.
Looks like it has to do with love
Here you are
Rani, I'm not the sort of guy you think I am
Yes, I made the mistake of keeping my temper under control
Else, I'd have beaten Sunny black and blue and throw him out of Goa
But Sunny's done a wonderful thing today
He has stopped me from going away
There's something I want to say to you, Rani
Rani...
I love you
I have loved you ever since I first set eyes on you
Since the day the Colonel started hating me
Colonel...
I've made a lot of mistakes.
Please forgive me
Rani, if you're not in love with me... it's cool.
I'll go away
But I have a feeling that you do
That you do love me
And thus, I publicly...
He's very upset!
I'm not asking for too much.
I only want you to marry me... so that we can have a family.
We can have kids... who take after you in looks; eyes, nose, lips, cheeks et al
I only want them to have my surname... because my dad had the surname Malhotra
All I want to say to you is...
Ask her, Will you marry me?
- I'll marry you, if she doesn't!
Rani... will you marry me?
Louder!
Will you marry me?
Can't hear you!
Rani!
Will you marry me?
Will you marry me...?
Say yes, sister-in-law.
- Please say yes!
Rani, I think he's the right boy for you
He at least won't hit me after he's married to you
Say yes, girl!
Go on!
That's a spirited boy.
He's in love with you!
He's saying as much in public.
So say yes!
Let the birds fly!
Say yes, sister-in-law!
Go on, my child.
Go!
Our kids will take after you in eyes and smile
And I like the surname Malhotra
Could I have the mike, please?
As my mother used to say... anger is love's worst enemy
One who can't control his temper, can't control anything in his lifetime
Sameer, my mother says, anger is love's worst enemy
One who can't control his temper, can't control anything in his lifetime
Not your mother!
That's what my friend Arun's mother used to say!
You remember what your friend used to say
But you've forgotten your friend?
You can't be Arun!
You're a scoundrel!
Arun was a gem of a guy!
Guess whose house I went to first, on my return from America... after 19 years?
Yours!
Sameer's not here.
Who are you?
- It's me!
Sameer's childhood friend.
Arun!
Good God!
Where's my buddy, grandma?
- He's away in Goa
Is he still as hot-tempered, or has he calmed down?
His temper has got worse with age, my son
Grandma then told me about your problem... how you had had a heart-break, how you had gone away to Goa... met Rani there and fallen in love with her... and how, for her sake, you had suppressed your anger
Okay then.
I'll go and phone Sameer
No, grandma.
You won't say a word to him
I'm going to treat him not as his friend, but as his adversary
That's how I landed in Goa... to stay with your house, in your room, with you!
I now know why you did this all the time, buddy boy!
C'mon!
The insolent!
- Go topless
Those with iron pajamas...
- Have an ape for an Uncle!
Whose aunts are cats...
- Have dogs for friends!
When it comes to the pickle...
- They hug, buddy!
The insolent!
- Go topless
Those with iron pajamas!
- Have an ape for an Uncle!
Whose aunts are cats...
- Have dogs for friends!
When it comes to the pickle...
- They hug, buddy!
What happened?
What's up now?
All over again!
What wrong have I done now?
- You're ill-fated, son
I'm jinxed!
But nothing can go wrong now
The poor chap's been suffering all this while
For your sake, he has remained a bachelor
You shall now become his bride... marry him
marry him
It seemed as if this chap was my tormentor
But he's the one who has shown me the right path
However, you are the one who shall become my bride
You must become his sister-in-law... you must marry me
Five!
Five!
Greetings, sire.
- May you be happy
Please take a look at My grandson's horoscope and predict his future
Certainly
Let Me see your forehead
The lines on his forehead Make it so obvious... that the fury of Jupiter, the Sun, Mars and Saturn will rule his life
They will dominate his life totally!
Should he be provoked by someone... this boy will certainly not spare him
What should we name him?
Sameer.
A gust of cool breeze.
- Sameer...?
By nature, he's hot-headed.
The name will keep him calm
Come to me, come...
Guess what?
Don't ever Make the Mistake of getting him Married
There you are!
He has kicked Me!
As he grows up, he'll use his fists and kicks More than his Mouth!
I'M not sparing you!
I'M not sparing you!
Never!
SaMeer!
Let him go!
Leave him alone!
C'Mon, SaMeer!
come with Me!
SaMeer, why did you raise your hand at the Principal?
When I lose My temper... it feels as if a hundred guitars are playing in My brains!
Now tell Me something.
Why did you hit Chintu?
I was angry because he abused you!
SaMeer, My Mother says, anger is love's worst enemy
One who can't control his temper, can't control anything in his lifetime
Now stop being angry and smile.
smile!
So you won't smile...?
I'll set your Mood right in a moment
The insolent!
- Go topless
Those with iron pajamas...
- Have an ape for an Uncle!
Whose aunts are cats...
- Have dogs for friends!
When it comes to the pickle...
- They hug, buddy!
SaMeer gets into a fight with someone or the other every day... and today, he raised his hands on Me!
The Principal!
So Much of anger is not good, Ma'aM.
It's Arun who always calms him down
He was born with the temper.
How will I explain...?
Ever since his parents have died, his temper is getting worse and worse I understand, Ma'aM.
And that is why I'M not throwing him out of the school
But I'M really worried. lf this is how SaMeer Malhotra's childhood is... how is his adolescence going to be?
So these three fractures and the 36 stitches... is it all your doing?
- Yes, sir. I've thrashed them
But you Must ask them why I hit them
There's this girl SaMeer wants to Marry... and these guys were treating her like a ball in the basket!
In 1998, you beat up a professor in the college?
He didn't have any time to teach the boys
But he used to call the girls home all alone and gave them tuitions
He had evil on his Mind.
So I gave it to him!
What wrong did I do?
In the year 2000, you rescued a Man who was drowning... and gave him a beating?
- l was the one who saved him too!
There was a board which said in bold letters, swimming is forbidden
Why did he go there?
I gave it to him... what wrong did I do?
Look, we have received eight complaints against you in the last five years
You Might get More
If I receive another complaint, you're going straight to jail!
roma...?
You've got Married?
Don't be angry today.
Please don't hit someone I'll...
- No, wait here
There's no saying when he Might hit someone
You think I'll hit you?
Why?
How can I hit you?
I...
And I thought you...
Did you think I'd Marry you?
- Yes
Have you ever told Me that you love Me?
- No
And look at him.
He's so sweet, so gentle... he loves Me so Much.
And you...
Now listen to Me.
No girl can ever fall in love with you
She can only be afraid of you.
- Why?
You have such a temper, even I'M afraid of you
remember how you thrashed those boys at the basketball court, SaMeer?
But they had Made a Mistake.
They had to be punished
Every human being Makes a Mistake.
What if I had Made a Mistake?
You'd have hit Me too, isn't it?
Isn't it true?
Let's go
SaMeer, are you really going away?
- Yes, grandma I've got the job of a lifeguard in Goa. lt's a nice job
Besides, I get into a lot of fights here, grandma lf l go to a new place and Meet new people, I Might not get into fights
My son, think again before you go
The reason behind the fights is your temper
Your temper will go with you wherever you go
Yes, brother. lf you leave, I'll be worried about you all the time
You're the one I'll worry about.
I've got to get you educated and Married l've got to have an operation conducted on grandma's eyes... and send her to grandpa in heaven at the earliest
I'M not going away in a hurry.
He'll have to wait!
But before you leave, you'll have to promise Me... that you won't get into fights and brawls with anyone ls that clear, My son?
grandma, I swear it on your head I'll never lose My temper again
One, two... is that your luggage, Mister?
Also this bag?
Four...?
Four bags?
Yes
Which is THE bag?
I Mean, the bag in which you're carrying the cash and valuables...?
Terrible times, you see.
You could easily be robbed
Robberies are commonplace in trains nowadays
Difficult to tell the bonafide passenger from the thief!
Go to sleep. I'll stay awake.
- l'M not sleepy
Mister, this period between 3 and 5 in the Morning... is Meant to be spent in slumber.
However strong a Man is... he does drift into it at least once I want to see when you go to sleep.
- l told you, I'M not sleepy
All right.
Actually, I love My forty winks I'M going to sleep
Yes, grandma, I've reached safely.
Okay...
Thank you, Mister.
- What for?
For looking after My luggage I'll explain. I have a weakness.
I can't stay awake in the night
And I can't sleep in the train, for fear of losing My luggage... and that is why, I pulled off the fast one
So that I could go to sleep and you'd look after My luggage.
Nice idea, eh?
Know what ?
You're a great guy I think I Must travel with you on My way back too
Here's My card.
Phone Me on this number, I'll find you at the station
Help Me, grandma!
"Praise the Lord..."
Lord, protect My grandson wherever he is
Lord, help SaMeer find his love
You...?
- Yes. I'M Raj.
He's Paul
Our Misfortune, we're brothers.
Twins I'M an astrologer who predicts people's future from their birthcharts... and he ruins their future!
What does your brother do?
- He belongs to the Eagle gang... very dangerous people.
Never cross their path
Never.
- You appear to be a stranger in town
whom are you visiting?
- Mr Duggal
Mr Duggal!
- Yes, he has a vacant room
Notjust a room, his brains are empty too
He used to be a police inspector in Goa... and has blood clotted in his head ever since a thief struck him with a stick
Wherever the clot stands, that part becomes useless
He plays deaf, dumb and blind
Let's see what he's playing today
He's playing blind today I don't believe this!
- You will, very soon
That's Mr Duggal!
But he's looking at Me.
- No, you're looking at him
Let Me show you.
Wait
Rascals!
You hit Me because I'M blind today?
When I start seeing again, none of you will be seen around here again!
Do you believe it now?
Wait a moment I'M glad you're here.
I haven't had any tea
Give Me half a litre of Milk ls the Milk over, Bansi?
I'M not Bansi. I'M SaMeer I'M sorry, I thought you were the milkman
When did the headlights go off?
How does that concern you?
You're not a doctor, are you?
Give Me the Milk.
- But I'M not a milkman... I'M Raj, the astrologer!
- The astrologer!
Such a big Mouth!
- lt's not My Mouth. lt's a bag
And here is your Mouth!
- Let Me be, please!
What brings you here...?
- l'M the one who came here I've landed ajob at the beach resort.
Mr SharMa has had a word with you
For the room, isn't it?
come, I'll take you to your room I'll show you to your room
Go upstairs from here.
Your room is right ahead.
Go on
There's no room there!
- No?
But I saw it last night.
Did it disappear overnight?
Hello.
- You're showing him the wrong place
The room is over there!
- Where?
Here!
come with Me.
- You're throwing Me out...?
We're actually going in!
I'll check out the room later.
Let's talk about the rent first I can pay you 2500 at the Most.
- l'll collect at least 5000 rupees!
It's okay if you agree.
Or you May leave...
Hey!
It's Me!
- Why do you keep butting in?
Give him half the room for 2500.
Find another tenant for the other half ls Bansi staying with you too?
- But I'M not Bansi!
Don't be angry.
Give Me half a litre of Milk
But I'M not the milkman!
I'M Raj... the astrologer!
So what are you doing here?
Go and look up people's horoscopes
Show SaMeer the room.
come, SaMeer... lt's Me!
Where's SaMeer?
- Here I aM, sir
C'Mon
"For My grandma's eyesight"
"For My sister's education"
"For My sister's Marriage"
Lord, it's Your responsibility to have an operation conducted on grandma's eyes
My sister's education and her Marriage is also Your responsibility
Fill up the coffers at the earliest, please
And okay, it's My responsibility to Make offerings to You at the temple
"O beautiful one..."
"come to Me"
Has Mr Duggal asked you to come and go through the balcony, brother?
No.
- Not your Mistake, though
Whoever stays in that house, does take a fall in his lifetime lt's because of the sight ahead.
- You're right
And I wish you keep doing this to Me every day I feel so nice today!
You...?
Already here to pick Me up?
I told you to call up and come
No, I can't go with you so early.
Okay, do something
Look around Goa for a couple of days, then we'll leave together
Who is he?
- Our new Manager
He'll kill Me!
You sent for Me, sir?
Are you Suraj?
- No
Suraj Prakash.
- time for you to set, Suraj (Sun)
You won't ever rise in the Morning again ln your 14 years of service, you were never in the night shift
from now on you will work in the night for a Month
Sir, I'll die.
- Two Months l'll be ruined, sir.
- Three Months
And listen...
- Yes sir?
Sleep is Man's worst weakness
And the time between 3 and 5 is the Most vulnerable one lf l see your shoulders droop at that time, you are off the roster I get it
Mr SaMeer
When did you get this Motorbike?
- My company gave it to Me today
No, you got it yesterday.
- Today
You're talking about the Motorbike, I'M talking about your eyes
You clapped your eyes on Rani yesterday, right?
Rani?
Who?
I'M watching the kids play
Really?
I'M a gifted astrologer I've seen your horoscope.
Let Me introduce you to Rani
Else, you will keep falling off your window I'M a priest of Love.
Because of us priests, two hearts Meet... a family is Made, new babies are born ... there's no greaterjoy than this
Her father, the colonel, is a strict Man, I hear
He's retired.
He May be pulled up any time
He won't find a better son-in-law.
- Never
He's going to embrace you in the first Meeting itself
Bye ls Ms Rani cross with you?
- No
Then why is she going that way?
Yes, priest?
- Please come here
She's coming
Once you guys shake hands, it won't take Much time for your hearts to Meet
come...
Be prepared
Haven't seen the colonel for days.
- Our car's in the garage
He's gone to pick it up.
- lll-fated carburetor, I told him
He Must at least fill gas worth 125 but he won't spend More than 25 bucks
Anyway... this is My childhood friend SaMeer
Not that we Met in childhood...
the two of us Met as adults
She's Rani
SaMeer is a lifeguard, and Rani is a fashion designer
Won't you shake hands?
Can't you take care of your kid?
What happened?
- A flat tyre?
No, someone got smacked
Who?
- Daddy!
What an introduction!
Who slapped him?
It sounded like an explosion
Are you all right, Papa?
- Don't ask Me, dear lt feels as if someone hammered a hot nail into My ear
You shouldn't have hit him so hard.
This girl is naughty
Thank God the colonel applied the brakes in time and saved her
Are you in your senses?
How dare you hit My Papa?
I didn't know he was your father.
And that kid...
What kid?
Her Mother is here, there are so Many people around... but they didn't utter a word!
You wanted to be a hero, eh?
Stop fighting and take him to a doctor, quick
Conductor?
I need a doctor, dammit!
- That's where we're going
He's gone deaf!
What have you done?
You were to ask Rani's hand from him and you just handed it out to him
Who is Rani, sir?
You?
Are you working day and night?
No sir. I just came to request you
Please be kind enough and turn My bad nights into good nights, sir
What for?
- Because after office hours... when I go home and shut the doors and windows to catch a wink... the kids around assemble outside My house and scream together...
"The Matinee show begins now"
And My wife takes it out on the kids saying, "No shows of late"
Sir, My honour is at stake
All right.
Give Me some time to think
Really?
How Much time?
- Say, a Month or two
What?
- When will My duty hours change?
Three Months after that
Who is this Rani, sir?
"Youth is short"
"The rest of life is no good"
"Once..."
"once it's gone..."
"youth never returns"
"What do you..."
"think about Me?"
"Don't take Me for a foe"
"Be My friend"
Lay off.
Let Me go
"Don't harass Me"
"Sweetheart, so Much..."
"of attitude is bad"
"Youth is short"
"The rest of life is no good"
"My love, enjoy..."
"every moment"
What you have, is in the present
"tomorrow never comes"
"l think you are crazy"
You and I don't sail in the same boat
"l can'tjust..."
"stop following you"
"Youth is short"
"The rest of life is no good"
Once..."
"once it's gone..."
"youth never returns"
Thank God you're here.
I was really worried
What for?
Aren't we friends now?
Yeah, but your father hasn't forgiven Me yet
When things go wrong in the beginning, it all falls in place in the end I don't get it.
Please explain I Mean, I've brought Papa around and he has called you over for dinner
Really?
Look, he's an army officer who is very punctual
You will be there at nine sharp I'll be there at eight.
- No way.
Neither early, nor late
You look very happy.
tommy's sister says, see you at home... as if you're going home to become tommy's brother-in-law
But to impress tommy's father, don't forget to buy champagne for him
And, you Must uncork it at one go!
is it SaMeer?
- Yes, sir
come on in.
- Actually sir, I've come to apologise I committed a Mistake the other day.
Please forgive Me I've forgiven you, that is why you are standing before Me
Lovely dog
He's tommy, not a dog
He's like My son.
remember
Sit
I'M from Patiala, Punjab.
- Really?
My uncle was in the army
Once I took his gun and ran to the fields, for some shooting practice
Enraged, he snatched the gun... and said, "lt's an official gun"
I was so peeved that I joined the army... and I got My own gun
A few years later, war for independence broke out in Goa
They posted Me here in Goa
After the war, I settled here with My family
Luckily, I love Goa
Luckily, I love Goa too
What do they call a chicken in Punjab?
- Kukdi
And a girl?
- Kudi
Those Medals... did you win them, sir?
My wife wasn't in the army, so obviously they belong to Me
Actually sir, your personality unsettles Me
That's why I'M talking like a fool
Never Mind
And that Chinese pot near the Medals... looks like an antique piece, does it contain Chinese tea?
It contains My late Mother's ashes
It gives Me a feeling that I always have her blessings with Me
You dearly loved your Mother.
- l still love her
We tried really hard to save her
But what God wills...
- Let it be, Papa
Let's eat
Why did you have to bring that, son?
It's My first time here.
- Let Me uncork it
No, sir.
Let Me have the pleasure
And to you, beautiful lady
What have you done?
So Mr Trouble, Mr Love's-Mistaken-ldentity...
Shut up!
It all happened because of you
Because of Me, really?
- You asked Me to uncork it at one go I asked you to open the bottle, not to break the pot of ashes
Good that the pot broke.
At least it has set his Mother's soul free
I think the colonel is insane
Oh no... he's a very intelligent Man lntelligent, My foot!
Mother's ashes ought to be immersed in the Ganges
No one keeps it at home.
Never in a pot, at that!
It's okay, we'll talk later.
- Let Me clear this now
Please try to see it from My point of view
Why don't you try to see it from My point of view?
Have you seen the colonel?
He looks as if he grew old twenty years back
Look at his wife... as if she has just stepped into youth
Tell Me, from what angle does Rani look like the colonel's daughter?
Yeah, tommy does appear to be his son I can't explain that.
You should be asking the person concerned
Who?
- Rani
The colonel would never reveal the secret to Rani
The other day I spared you because it was only a Mistake
But today, you intentionally...
You hit My Papa on his face... still I forgave you.
But today you've hurt Me in the heart
Can you explain?
- Rani...
Did you intend to say that My father didn't sire Me?
No!
- That My Mother is wanton?
No!
It was tough convincing Myself that you are a nice person
And you, priest!
I'M really surprised
How could you consider such a lowly Man a friend?
Let alone respect someone, he hardly knows what respect Means
See?
She is hurt because of you!
- Because of Me, really?
I was only kidding.
When you knew Rani was standing behind Me... why didn't you tell Me?
- l was telling you... see from My point of view!
- Your language is too tough for Me
For all the Mistakes you commit, you pass the buck on to Me!
God!
Ball?
What happened?
- A flat tyre?
No, someone got thrashed
Who?
- Papa!
Granny!
I'M ill-fated, it's writ.
Reading My horoscope won't turn things around
Just checking what's worse is in store.
- What...?
Your past was your golden period.
- Golden period, really?
Yes.
Your future is worse.
- Worse than what I'M going through?
Jupiter's place is right up here.
Yours is down in hell
The Moon's place is in the 7th house.
Yours is homeless
Moreover, Saturn is about to enter
You said, Saturn left Me last week.
- And it did
Usually, once it leaves, Saturn never returns for another seven years
Not in your case.
Saturn is about to re-enter in a few seconds time
Right, anything is possible with Me.
- Saturn is on its way
And it will wreck Me.
- This Saturn is going to... change your life and destiny.
It will come like a tempest
"What say, dude?"
He's going to steal the princess away
As per My calculations, it will stay with you in your room... and knock at Rani's door
Hello uncle
Hello, I say.
remember Me?
I'M your distant relative.
Sunny
For Miles away, uncle has no relatives.
Go away
Uncle, your servant is ill-Mannered.
Ask him not to Mess with Me
Why is he so quiet?
- Not that he is glad to remain quiet
He's ailing.
- Shut up
Uncle, I'M Sunny.
Mr Khurana's son
Who...
Khur... ana?
Who Khurana?
- Back in Gurudaspur... this road in front of your house...
- There's one in front of every house it turns around the corner.
- They all turn.
No road is straight
And where does it go?
Straight to his friend's house
Friend?
Who?
- Mr Khosla
He just said Khurana!
- How smart!
You caught Me I was only testing you.
Know what?
When I asked your address... everyone said there's only one decent and honest boy in Goa.
You
Boy...?
What a fraud!
Tell Me honestly, why are you here?
- Well, I... want to hire a room
No, he says.
Go away
No way, get lost, he says.
Look, he's pissed off
Now tell Me.
- Stay here
Well, now that you are dumb, you won't pick up a fight
So let's go to My relative's place.
- Relative, aunt?
Then who am I?
Who are you?
- Sunny
Not Sunny, he's Shani (Saturn).
- Shut up, dude
Uncle, for My sake don't tell aunt where l come from
Well, uncle himself doesn't know where he comes from
Aunt, I'M a tenant here.
Here's 10,000 bucks
Take another 9,999... take care I'M a bit tired.
Show Me to My room, please
Let Me see you off at the next street.
- Ass!
Hold this.
Bring it upstairs
Oldie's got a nice room.
- Yes
But we are sharing it
What are you staring at Me for?
- Why share?
We'll be exchanging beds
We'll also sleep in the same bed, as brothers...
Don't touch Me. I don't like it
Like the rent, we share the room too.
This side is yours, that's Mine
All right, give Me a hug.
- No!
I don't hug Men
Really?
How vain
Whatever.
- Okay listen... why don't you take your God there?
- God doesn't belong to one person
God belongs to everyone.
And listen, we've shared the room... not the walls.
God's not Moving.
- And where do I stick My posters?
Wherever you wish.
God's not Moving I got an idea.
Stick them up in the bathroom
Why do you get so angry?
- AM I angry?
Now!
Even while you are talking.
- Yeah, where am I angry?
Look, the room's got hot.
Need to open the window
Don't open the window!
Why?
- She comes there I need to check her out then.
Since I pay half the rent... I'll open half the window
You're on My half, let Me embrace you!
- Don't piss Me off!
I tried My best to keep him off
What a sight!
Mr SaMeer deliberately kept the door shut to keep Me off
But smelling a scent from a distance is My forte
What a dish!
- Don't you say that!
Does she Mean anything to you?
- No.
But decent folks stay here
By the way she is a nice and decent girl
And she's a colonel's daughter.
He will shoot you if he hears you
For a beauty like her, I'd take a bullet on My chest
On My chest idiotic!
Don't you jump!
- Why not?
You are in bad times, as it is
For all your good intentions, you Might fall on top of the colonel
He's going in.
- No.
As per My calculations...
tommy will have a go at him
He's gone inside.
- Not to worry.
My calculations say... the colonel will kick him out in a Minute
What's your name?
- tommy
Nice name.
My respects, uncle
Who are you?
What do you want?
- l just wanted to Meet you, uncle I'M new here. I'M told that you are the only decent and honest boy around
Boy?
- What else?
Look at you
You can put any young Man to shame.
Besides... hang on.
What's that in your ears?
And what's around your neck, bro?
Don't ask Me.
My blood boils when I think of it
Screwed My calculations!
What are you doing?
- Worry not. I have fixed Many bones
And it's only a sprain.
Look straight... here goes
What say?
How do you feel?
Be honest.
- Feels nice
Where are you staying?
- At your neighbour Mr Duggal's place
The one who broke My neck also stays there
Don't be angry. I'M his roommate.
I know he's ill-Mannered... and he'll surely change, but this is not how one should treat an elder
A ball hit Me, by Mistake
Darling, what's happening?
When did you employ a Masseur?
from today.
- Oh no, he's not a Masseur, darling
Sunny is a nice boy
He's Mr Duggal's tenant.
- l see
Tell you something, Massage is not actually done indoors
A garden, or an open terrace would be just amazing
We have a terrace garden.
- Don't tell Me.
Really?
Where?
Upstairs.
- Can I check it out?
Sure
Did he swallow something?
He's dancing ... advancing towards the girl
damn... your love-story began here and ended in the colonel's ears
He began it by shaking hands, and it's going to end in honeymoon
Sir, do something.
Please do something to Me
What do I do to you?
- l want a baby
Give Me a baby, please!
- What...?
What are you doing here?
- You!
What are you doing here?
You know her?
- She is My wife
Don't you have children?
- Yes, two in fact
Boys, both.
And you know what these boys are like I want a daughter.
- So why Me?
Ask him
Listen... please
What?
- He promised to give Me a daughter
After duty hours, he used to get Me sweets and flowers... and shut the doors and windows
But ever since you put him on the night shift... the doors and windows only shut to allow him get a good day's sleep lt's a Mistake but a Mistake is a Mistake
You Must also have committed a Mistake, by Mistake, no?
Yes, you are right
And I can understand your problem.
I'll definitely help you
Hang on
from tomorrow, you will buy her sweets and flowers every day
What the...?
Get up
Was I wrong?
500 for grandma, 500 for My sister's studies... 500 for her Marriage, and 500...
"For My roommate"
What a sight!
It's worth paying a hundred thousand in rent
What are you upto?
- Watching the colonel
Really?
- Wanna check?
That's his daughter
Do they look alike?
No way!
And what are you drinking?
Water.
- Really?
I swear by you.
- l see.
Go on
Let Me smell it... is this water?
Fenny is Goa's speciality.
It's nothing but cashewnutjuice I see. I'll juice you!
I'M going to tell Mr Duggal that you are boozing here
Listen...
Don't touch Me.
- l won't booze anymore, promise
All right.
- One last swig
What's that?
- Oh, those?
Your God's on My wall, so I glued My goddesses to your wall
So why get angry?
- l'M not angry
You are peeved.
- l'M not
Relax... easy
You feel like abusing Me.
- Not at all I know, you want to tell Me something.
- No
You want to hit Me.
Go on, hit Me.
- No
C'Mon, hit Me.
- Oh no
Why don't you go to your half?
- Okay.
Peace
Peace
What was that?
Earthquake?
Mr Duggal, where did you pick that roommate from?
He boozes, and... watches Rani through his binoculars, You Must go and inform the colonel
Oh, why would you inform the colonel?
The ass has stuffed you with Money
Rather I'll go and inform him
Mr Duggal...
looks like he's deaf today
He's deaf
Young Man, My neck feels better now
Hello aunt.
- Do something to My ear
Let Me fix your neck first.
Fixing the ear is no big deal lt will be all right.
Where's Rani?
See, rama?
Though they share the same room, they are poles apart
That swine injures Me, and the other... the decent one, comes home everyday to give Me a Massage
Hush, tommy
SaMeer is not around, then who is tommy barking at?
Dogs have a very sharp memory, uncle
tommy Must be barking at SaMeer's thoughts
Where's Rani?
Bloody dog!
Guess what?
You look so happy.
What gives?
- This year, the All India...
Fashion Designers' competition is going to be held in Goa
The designs I had sent have been approved
And I'M participating this year!
Papa, I got to pay the entry fees within two days.
Only 20,000 Rupees
Let her have it. I'll return every cent after Marriage 20,000?
No dear, I can't afford that Much
Please Papa, for My sake.
It's very important for My career
Golden opportunities don't knock twice.
Give her the Money
Where's the Money, son?
I'M a retired colonel
We Manage with My pension.
Where do I get 20,000 from?
Selfish father
You upset her
Expenses have already risen this Month. 12,000 for the hearing aid 3000 for My neck-collar.
Where do I get 20,000 from?
Why won't you give her?
You still have your eyes... heart, lungs and kidneys intact.
I'll puncture them all
Granny you ask Me not to lose My temper!
Tell Me, why not?
The colonel won't give Rani the Money.
Who will help the poor girl?
I wish I could strangle his...
Granny, I got a solid idea
Postpone your eye surgery.
Let's first help Rani realise her dream.
What say?
Besides, granny, Lord Krishna's birthday is approaching
The Lord is here!
Be careful with your pots, lassies...
So Much!
Let it go!
That's not a biscuit
Bloody dog!
Let it go
What's that?
"Dearest Rani, I know you want to become a famous fashion designer"
"l'M sending you Money..."
"to help you cross the first hurdle in the path of your progress"
"Not a favour, just consider it as a gift from a friend"
"And, if you win the show..."
"you will be happy, but My happiness will be greater than yours"
"l expect nothing in return for this small help.
Not even thanks"
"Your well-wisher"
How long will you conceal your youth, My love?
How long will you torment the bachelors?
someday you are going to become someone's bride
"Will you Marry Me?"
"Will you Marry Me?"
I'll buy you earrings and bangles...
"l'll buy you everything, I swear"
I'll steal the Moon, I'll even pluck the stars... I'll Make the Sun bow before you, I swear
"someday you will go crazy for Me"
"Will you Marry Me?"
"Will you Marry Me?"
"The day I come as a bridegroom, I won't go back..."
I'll take you away in a palanquin, I swear
I'll steal you away, before everyone
"l'll Make you My bride, I swear"
How long will you show indifference, My love?
"Will you Marry Me?"
"Will you Marry Me?"
How long will you conceal your youth, My love?
How long will you torment the bachelors?
someday you are going to become someone's bride
"Will you Marry Me?"
"Will you Marry Me?"
"l will Marry you"
"l will Marry you"
Cheat!
You never told Me you play the guitar so well
What a revelation!
All those lessons in guitar seem worthwhile today
Have a laddoo.
- What's the occasion?
I told you I want to participate in the fashion designing competition I paid the entry fees today.
- Really?
I'll take two laddoos.
- Why?
One for Me and one for My God
Go ahead
Bye
What a shame
Bloody untuned drum!
Did your father ever play a guitar?
Give it here
Papa is... a businessman in Indore
A businessman, really?
And you were playing the guitar, eh?
When did I say that?
The poor girl thought it was Me
And you were tongue-tied, no?
You could only grin
Couldn't you say that it was Me?
- AM I nuts to tell her that... it wasn't Me but it was our Master SaMeer Malhotra who was playing?
She was so impressed, dude.
And she even saw the posters of your goddesses
Know what she said?
"What a shame"
You're in My half. I'll kiss anything that comes My way, I told you
The priest said it right!
You are not Sunny but Shani (Saturn)
Stay away from Me
I got My temper under control!
I wish I could tear you apart
He's coming.
- Sunny, haven't I reminded you... to pay the rent?
- l've Mailed the address to Daddy
He should be sending the Money.
- lf it doesn't arrive this time... you will have to leave.
remember.
- Uncle... did I ever harass you?
Have I ever troubled you, aunt?
Then why don't you clean the railings?
Look...
Pay the rent, we'll clean it daily.
What...?
He's gone.
- You should've told Me ls Mr Duggal in?
- Yes.
So?
There's a letter for Sunny
Sunny stays here, right?
- Yes, dammit!
Go in
Mr Duggal, there's a letter for Sunny
Hey, where are you going?
Give Me.
- Two?
Two letters?
whom is the second letter for?
- Only one!
I asked him to give it
So take it and drive him out.
- l'M going
Move it.
Do you fancy eating and sleeping here?
Has he left?
Okay, read the letter.
- lt's for Sunny
Why should we read it?
- Why not?
He's our tenant
We Must know what type of a person he is, what kind of people write to him
Read
Go on
Let Me open it.
- ls it Made of steel?
"Dearest son, Sunny, ever since you have left, I've been worried"
"Your planes are grieving.
There's no one to pilot them"
"Son, without you, what use are six bungalows and eight factories to Me?
I hear, you are staying with a beggar"""
If you wish to extend your stay, revert back I'll present a huge bungalow to your landlord
"Your Papa"
I Must leave now.
- Where are you going, son?
Papa hasn't sent Money, not even a letter.
How can I stay here?
Did I really offend you?
Do you have a problem here, son?
No, no.
- All I have on Me is a fake coin
You guys snatched 10,000 bucks from Me and you ask Me if I have a problem 10,000?
Just ask Me, and I'll give you 10,000 every day
But please don't quit this place
from now on, we'll cook for you.
I'll do your laundry too
Let go of My hand, will you?
And who will wash My underwear?
I will do that.
I'll even give you a bath
But don't ever leave this place.
- Don't ever go, son
Tell you something... somebody has rightly said, if you want true love... stay in a poor Man's shanty
Put the binoculars down!
Else, I'll inform the Colonel
Go ahead
Are you boozing?
I told you not to drink, didn't I?
Wait till I tell Mr Duggal.
- Go ahead and tell him
You wait here!
Mr Duggal!
Who the hell...?
Are you boozing here?
- D'you want Me to sit on the roof?
What if I fall down?
- You're drunk I can't...!
You are blind now, I'll talk to you in the Morning
Makes no difference.
I've been blind since Morning
Don't Mind the poor fellow.
Here, grab your bottle
Here you are.
- See?
That's a tenant
And you never treated Me even to a cup of tea
He's helping Me live it up, you know.
- Where is he taking you?
Oh, I forgot!
We got to Meet Bijli!
Let's go
come on.
Not there... this way
Don't go. lt's a bad habit.
- Don't go, My foot!
Clear the litter, will you?
- He tells Me to clear the litter
Don't do it. lt's My house.
Who is he to give orders?
I'M going to throw it away!
- Pick it up and throw it outside!
Here goes!
Bloody...!
Who got smashed?
- Who?
The Colonel
Who hit him?
- Brother SaMeer
Our friendly neighbourhood hunter.
He's hunted Many a colonel down!
You are in My half, let Me kiss you
Go, neck Bijli!
Rani, once again, forgive Me
Neck Bijli, you will be forgiven
"The thorn"
"Oh, the piercing thorn"
"come, My love"
Behind your bungalow, under the berry tree...
"My love..."
"a thorn pierced Me"
Now that you are in trouble, you wonder...
"why you couldn't stay without Me"
Your friends were right when they said...
"you will be trapped someday"
"Get that?"
"l'M sorry..."
"let bygones be bygones"
"Save My heart this time, My love"
"Your clothes are skimpy... even the blindman says, show it to Me"
"Show it"
"Get lost"
"Move it"
Another 15,000?
What for?
I have already paid 20000
That was entry fees.
15,000 is entertainment tax
You should've told Me before.
The show is at hand, how can I raise...?
entertainment tax is a government policy.
Everybody knows that lf you don't pay by evening, you cannot do the show tomorrow
Why can't she?
She is My Rani
Don't weep... please don't
You will do the show I promise you, you will do the show
Sis, I just heard that the government says... it's illegal to get a girl Married before she turns 21
Which Means you have three More years to go, sis
And your sister-in-law has only three days
Why don't you concentrate on your studies for the next three years?
Shall I break the pot?
Thank you, dear sister
Still short of 5000!
I'M seriously stressed now
You got to help Me now, God
That was for My sister's studies!
You could've broken Your piggy bank
come here... do you know her?
Hot, eh...?
You're throwing kisses at your sisters...?
I can't figure out what to say
Many people are responsible for this dream come TRUE
But there is someone I want to specially thank I don't know his name, nor do I recognise him
I've never Met him, but he's the anonymous friend... who helped Me out when I needed support the Most
He calls himself My well-wisher I appeal to him.
if you can hear Me... please come and Meet Me.
I'd like to personally thank you
My dear God, grandma always says that a princess will come into My life
But not even a Maid-servant has come into it till today
But I feel today as if the Princess will surely come
God, don't Mess up things.
I love her too Much I'd have called her home, but Sunny's around, you see?
So I've called her here.
Nothing wrong, is there?
Nothing wrong.
Everything you've done is good I've heard it all SaMeer.
That which you tried to say... and also that which you didn't say.
You did so Much for Me... and didn't even let Me know?
"You shall pine at heart, My love..."
by God, you too shall fall in love
"At heart, I shall desire you too"
"by God, I hope I fall in love too"
"You're charming..."
you're My love, you're My romance I'M bowled over...
yes, I acknowledge that I know, your love is full of Mischief
But I can't help it, My heartjust won't agree
"How I wish I rule your heart"
By God, May you fall in love too
"They call Me beautiful, they call Me the proud one..."
"and you've gone crazy;
you have no control over your heart"
I'M no less crazy.
I'M not conceding defeat
"l'M here to steal your heart, and steal it, I will"
"How I wish I begin to trust you"
By God, I hope I fall in love too
"May you begin to pine at heart"
By God, May you fall in love too
God!
What a sweet dream!
Make it come true, please!
Here she is!
By the way, You've done a great job in Making her, God
Sunny...?
Can't be!
God, why's he...?
Sunny!
You...?
Which Means you're the well-wisher...?
I didn't want to say it.
But I knew... you'd get to know some day.
- But...
Stop necking him!
Give Me the hug!
He's a fraud!
You...
My...?
Rani!
Rani!
Don't go with him!
I'M Me...
I'M not him!
I'M the one she loves.
Leave her alone!
God!
Make him see reason!
Let go of her cheek, you scoundrel!
Rani, I'M the real one!
I'M not him!
Out of the way, Colonel!
Step aside!
What...?
Step up...?
Out of the way!
Out!
What happened...?
Who got smashed?
The Colonel got smashed!
Sunny, don't be shy, have some More.
Eat to your fill
The Milk reminds Me of home
This is your home too.
- Absolutely
We can't ever forget what you have done for our Rani
And you didn't even let Me know.
- Ma always says... your left hand Must not know what your right hand does
Hear that?
Such lofty ideals!
- Pickles!
I don't know where they are
Not pickles, ideals, darling.
- ideals, I see
They are poles apart.
One is an angel while the other is a demon
The More distance l keep from him, the closer he gets to deal a blow
With a football, when I'M at home.
With a bottle, when I'M outside
When I'M walking on the footpath, he calls Me in the Middle of the road... and rams his Motorbike into Me
Be careful.
Say it again, SaMeer
Colonel, I'M sorry, I've been a bloody fool
Accept these flowers and please forgive Me
Okay, I forgive you
Where does the Colonel get his voice?
- God knows
Where did he transpire from?
Wake up!
We are here
Who is this sleepy character?
- A security guard
He tried to Mess with Me, I put him on a three-Months' night shift
No wonder he brings his wife to Make an appeal to you
Uncle!
How are you, dear niece?
- You've pulled down!
Can't tell you what I've been through
Rani's uncle?
This Man could've been your Cupid... but you've already plunged him into the darkness
Brother-in-law, you are wrapped all over in bandages?
What happened?
Sunny, he is My wife's brother
Swine!
Where have you been all this while?
Brother, I'M cross with you.
We live in the same city, yet... you haven't been here for Months.
- What city, sister?
I don't even get to see My wife.
- What does that Mean?
This new Manager, the swine, has put Me on night shift since two Months
He sleeps during the daytime, and stays up like an owl during the nights
He's suffering from constipation and acidity
Look at the dark circles below his eyes
That's fine, but who's that scoundrel?
That's fine, but who are you?
- Uncle, he is Sunny.
Our neighbour I see.
Glad to Meet you.
- We'll Meet later
You were talking about some Manager...
- Don't even Mention the swine
What has he done?
- He's Made life Miserable for Me
What's his name?
- Bloody Saturn!
Shut up
SaMeer
Uncle, our SaMeer.
Your neighbour.
My roommate SaMeer
What...?
SaMeer stays in the neighbourhood?
Which beggar in the neighbourhood?
- Not a beggar, it's SaMeer
One who wrecked you!
Now he's after him
That swine is after My whole family
time's not favourable, SaMeer
Forget the flowers, forget the colonel, placate the uncle
Uncle...
The tables have turned.
Now watch the fun
Uncle, aunt...
I've got some presents for you
Skirt and blouse for you
Bush shirt for you, uncle
Sweets for the kids
Also some fruits for the two of you I hope you don't expect these things to bear fruit?
Oh no, of course not
Uncle, if by any chance I have uttered something wrong... please forgive Me. I've realised that I've been unfair to you
You are off the night shift.
- What...?
Then how about tonight...?
- Sure
Son-in-law...
- Son-in-law...?
Son-in-law, indeed.
The other day when I asked you about Rani... had you answered Me, you'd have been Married by now
And I would be your uncle
Uncle, a Mistake is committed by Mistake
You Must also have committed a Mistake, by Mistake, no?
Aunt, aM i wrong?
- You are absolutely right, son-in-law
Greetings.
- Greetings.
come in
Colonel sahib...
- You!
Don't you dare step inside!
Stay where you are
Colonel sahib, consider it My bad luck or My karma... for all My good intentions, things invariably go wrong... and I end up hurting you.
- 5000 people live around here
Of all, why do you always choose to hurt Me?
Colonel sahib, the new year is about to set in, in a few hours time
With the passing year, let bygones be bygones, please l beg your forgiveness
D'you take Me for a coward?
remember, I'M a soldier I kept forgiving you because I considered you a kid
Not anymore
Get this loud and clear
Henceforth, for 50 Metres around Me... if I see you, or see you throwing anything... the last time I fired My gun was against the Portuguese... this time it's going to be you
Yes, colonel sahib
Happy happy new... handcuffs
is this a new way to wish a new year?
- l'll tell you
Where's Charles?
Charles?
Or SaMeer?
- SaMeer?
is he a new kid in the Charles gang?
Have women joined Charles' gang too?
There's no aunty here!
Oh, this one?
What's the problem in his pants?
- Today he's become a police officer
become, eh?
Tell Me something... you're an honest officer's wife, how do you know such criminals?
I'M not a criminal, ask you neighbour if you wish
Who neighbour?
The retired soldier?
Now I get it.
After retirement he's been sheltering criminals
Let Me go.
Rani is waiting for Me.
- Waiting for what?
To Murder someone?
To loot a bank?
Or to print fake stamp papers?
- What the hell...?
Boy, you are going to rot here until the police van arrives
Then you'll go to jail.
come on, don't stare at him
The ass who smashed his head is on the loose, and I'M trapped here
AM I wearing a convict's clothes?
AM I going to Meet Rani in 2010?
Ladies and gentleman... and friends, let Me show you another Magical act
Look, this is Magic
Forgive Me, Mr Magician, but pulling out a bouquet from a cloth... a pigeon from a turban and a rabbit from a box is quite simple I'll believe you if you can cast a spell on Me
He's challenging Me
All right, boy, it's no big deal.
Lie down on the bench
Sure.
That's no big Magic
No, but it's going to be
Friends, now My Magic wand is going to suspend this boy in thin air
If a stick can Make someone float in the air... no one would care to buy air tickets.
They would be waiting for the stick I'M an astrologer, you see.
- Before you stands a Magician, fool
C'Mon, lie down!
- At your service
Windbag!
Here I go
Abracadabra!
Let the boy float in air
Don't Mess with a Magician!
Or, you will stay suspended in air
Magician, I believe you now I fear, I Might go right up there I pray, put Me down
All right
How he lifted him up, we didn't even get to know
This girl wouldn't believe Me
Rani, your arm on My shoulder is one pretty sight
Let Me Make it simple for you, SaMeer
Stay 50 Metres away from Papa and 500 Metres away from Me.
You dig?
I'll show you guys a wonder now
You... please come here
Me...?
- Don't go!
He'll put you in a box... and hack you to pieces...
One boy.
Any one, please
Mr Magician, there's a boy!
Strong, rough, tough and reliable
Seize your chance before Sunny arrives.
Go!
come this side, please.
- No, I'M fine here
Please come here lf he is in, I'M off.
Find someone else
Hang on, lady
Rather I'd leave I get it
The two of you are cross with each other.
All right... I'll turn the enmity into friendship.
- Can you do that?
Of course, and I'll turn your hatred into love
Hang on.
Your name?
- Rani
And you are...?
- SaMeer
So, SaMeer and Rani... the two of you are Man and wife from now on
And tonight, is your first New Year night
Tell everyone how Much you love each other
What are you staring at?
- admiring you
Had you not traipsed into My life, I'd have been a nobody I'd have been an anklet sans the chime
I'd have been a soleless shoe
A heartless body lf not for you, Rani...
- Not Rani... call Me Mrs SaMeer Malhotra
To be honest, I fell in love with you at first sight I have endured so Much to possess you
Don't torment Me anymore.
come...
Well...
I can wait no longer either
"Your beloved seeks your heart"
"come to Me, My love"
"Profess your love"
"Give in to Me, My love"
"l'M pining, so are you"
"l'M waiting for you"
"Profess your love"
"Give in to Me, My love"
"Your charms..."
"like the tempest, My love"
"Your looks..."
"My identity, My love"
"Gaze into My eyes"
"Make Me belong to you"
"Profess your love"
"Give in to Me, My love"
"You have done Me a favour"
"You are in My dreams..."
"you are all I desire"
"Let's Make a legend of love"

"Profess your love"
"Give in to Me, My love"
"Your beloved seeks your heart"
"come to Me, My love"
"Profess your love..."
"give in to Me, My love"
"come to Me, My love"
"Give in to Me, sweetheart"
The Prince has fallen in love with the Princess...
SaMeer, I've been thinking.
- What?
You can play the guitar, paint, sing... you're quite a Multi-talented Man.
- Guess why?
That's because I'M Me.
Not you!
Having a ball, aren't you?
- You have a great talent too
What?
- You tell lies to fool people!
Listen, Make a portrait for Me too
Don't Mind, but I paint only beautiful people!
Know what?
- What, what?
I'M in a great Mood today.
Say what you want to
You aren't as innocent as you appear to be
Why?
How you brought Rani around in just two hours last night
Weren't you jealous!
As close as you get to her, I want to get closer to her too
Aren't you jealous?
Aren't you?
What's your problem?
My problem is that I want to score with My friend's girlfriends... it Makes Me very happy!
When I get Married, I want you to paint Me and My wife together
You know, with her at My side.
And I lying down in her lap
She in black-and-white, I in colour...
Sure, I will
whom are you Marrying?
Bijli?
No, it's Rani
Aren't you jealous?
Aren't you?
See?
Your temper hurts you yourself, doesn't it?
If it wasn't for the oath, I'd have squeezed him out like the tube!
Where's SaMeer?
- The brush!
Get to be the Master's disciple!
Quick!
"Life's a dream..."
Who...?
Rani, you...?
You can even paint!
- Well, I...
My painting...?
How sweet!
Tears and desires, that's how it is
You're quite a revelation, Sunny.
- No revelation
Painting, singing, the guitar...
- No wonder they call you Multi-talented
SaMeer's Multi-talented too
You ought to have seen him at the party last night
The way he sang and danced... I've been teaching him classical dancing and he's into rock?
Anyway, fresh orange juice for the two of you.
Where's he?
He's in the latrine right now
He'll take some time.
You can wait.
- No thank you
Give him some and you have some too.
Happy New Year
Was Rani here?
- Yes, she was
You'll now ask Me if even My father has even done any painting
And I'll say, My Papa's a very big businessman in Indore
You'll say, "Liar, dog..."
- That you really are
Your dream of Making Rani fall in love with you will remain a pipe dream lt won't be a pipe dream.
Because I know what your weakness is
Really?
What is it?
You can never tell Rani that you love her
So listen!
I swear it on My grandma!
I will profess My love to Rani in the presence of the whole world today!
And I swear it on My father in Indore too I'M the one who'll bring Rani to this house, as a bride
If My love is true, I'll be the one who'll Marry Rani
And if I'M determined enough, I'll lead her here by the hand
For Me.
You are Rani's brother
No brother. I'M her lover
Rani, you think this lover-boy is an accomplished singer and painter I'll expose him to you today
C'Mon, sweetheart, let's go
This juice Rani brought for you.
I'll have it
Hold it!
Who did she bring it for?
- For you
So I'll drink it!
Share it with Me!
I can't share anything of Rani's!
May you find it bitter!
I find everything of Rani's to be sweet
At least let out a burp!
I'll paint a picture and also sing a song... and expose Sunny.
Okay?
What new ailment is this?
One Duggal is difficult to tolerate
Three, five...?
More than I can endure!
Where do you think you're going?
Stop there!
Lie down here, Rani.
I'll put them to bed and return
C'Mon!
Eagle!
I'M going to Make you a seagull!
Senior!
Swat this fly!
You've Made a Mistake by Messing with the Eagle Gang!
One Sunny I can't tolerate.
And six of them walk up to Me!
I'M going to thrash all six of them!
C'Mon!
tommy!
come here!
come!
You always bark at Me, don't you?
So bark now... bark!
The next time you bark, you're going to disappear.
You get that...?
Take care of your kids and your dogs!
I'll spare you this time.
Next time, you're gone
tommy, My son, don't keep going outside
There are bad people in the locality
Have I ever raised My voice with you?
Have I?
And how SaMeer was yelling at you yesterday!
The insolent chap!
Go and play in the house, son.
And don't go out...
My good son!
tommy!
tommy...
tommy, where have you gone?
You ought to have considered what would happen to Me without you!
Darling, we too are sad that tommy's gone Missing
But how long will you keep starving, thinking about him?"
Let's eat, Papa.
I'M hungry too
No, My child.
I don't feel like it
Colonel... I've looked everywhere in Goa, but there's no trace of tommy l don't know where he has gone.
Could someone have kidnapped him?
But who could be tommy's enemy?
Mr Duggal!
That's it
No... he hasn't been around since yesterday
SaMeer...?
- Why SaMeer?
No, can't be SaMeer.
But he could do a thing like this too.
remember his public threat?
That he'd Make the dog disappear!
If the dog barks, I'll kill him, I'll finish him!
No way, he was drunk.
- Really...?
But who then...?
He's the culprit!
Who is it?
That scoundrel has broken Me in every part of My body!
I don't know what revenge he is extracting from Me... by having tommy separated from Me!
SaMeer!
Where are you hiding, you thief?
This is a warning!
If you don't return SaMeer to Me in 24 hours... I'll have you sent to jail!
I still hold sway among the cops.
I'M not sparing you!
What does that Mean?
- He has influence
Give him the dog!
May the worms get you!
What new fuss is this...?
Have your father treated
Why'd I have My brother-in-law kidnapped anyway?
Why...?
Where am I going to look for this dog now?
You have a variety of dogs
- Hush!
Don't call them dogs.
They take offense I've brought them up like My own children
That's RustoM, that's Sohrab.
Eats less, snarls all the time
That's Cyrus.
Faithful.
But eats and enjoys a good life
And that is...
This is the dog I want.
Do you have it?
I do have it!
That's My boy, Tin Tin!
Say hello!
Quite a good boy.
But once he loses his temper... he's going to bite.
And remember... don't ever give him a cold bath
But this one doesn't have a black spot.
- Don't worry!
Here's the solution!
Mr Colonel...
look who's here
tommy!
My son...!
Where had you gone away to?
Where did you find him, SaMeer?
- The poor chap... was sitting by a laMp-post, shivering.
He used to always bark at Me
But this time, he said, "Papa..." and went for My feet
He appeared to be telling Me, "Please take Me to My Papa"
Papa...?
- You
Oh yes!
He's like My son, of course!
Papa, it's because of SaMeer that we have tommy back today
You Must forgive him at least now.
- Sure, I forgive him!
rama, lay the table
What's happening here?
Look at this, Sunny!
tommy's back today because of SaMeer
Look Me in the eye, My brother!
Where did you find the dog...?
Where did you find it?
I went Mad looking for it!
For Rani's sake, look into My eyes!
Where did you find the dog?
Tell Me!
Sunny, I don't know what's gotten into My tommy
He's been behaving like a stranger ever since he has returned
He seems to have changed.
- He has stayed with the stray dogs I know a cure!
Squeeze him in a bucket of cold water!
Squeeze him ?
- l Mean, give him a cold bath
Oh, I see.
All right
Please sit down.
- Won't you give tommy a bath?
No!
I'll first give tommy a bath.
I'll have breakfast later
The breakfast will get cold, papa.
- l'll be back soon, My child
Let's take a bath, tommy boy!
- Where's SaMeer?
Sunny, please call SaMeer, will you?
- Not Me, he sleeps till late
He'll hit Me for no reason.
You go and call him instead
All right, I'll call him
"We shall overcome..."
Who is it?
Are you asleep, SaMeer?
Wake up!
Sunny, don't change your voice and bother Me!
Let Me sleep!
Rani...?
One second.
I'll be out there
Who are you...?
Who on earth are you?
- Bijli
But who...?
- lt's Rani
One moment, Rani. I'M coming!
What are you doing here?
What?
- What are you doing here?
I was sleeping with you I came to call you for breakfast I've said nothing!
I'll join you in two seconds!
Go away!
- Where?
Want Me to come...?
- Go away!
Give that to Me?
- What?
That one.
- What?
I'M coming inside
God!
I'M so sorry, Rani.
How disgusting!
What you think is wrong, Rani!
- How about what I see?
This one...?
It's not Mine.
It's hers!
I've done nothing wrong, Rani.
Please try to understand...
You... I'll fix you!
Rani...
"The pierce of the thorn..."
I swear it on you, Rani!
I don't know that girl!
How could you with a girl you don't know...?
I swear, I don't even know her!
- Without knowing them... will you call just about any girl?
- Listen to Me, Rani...
You've started getting girls into your bed now!
This is too Much, Rani!
Listen to Me!
Hey girl, can't you hear what boss is saying to you?
Do just as the boss says.
Okay?
Else the Eagle Gang will catch you and present you to the boss, okay?
What are you guys saying?
- command us, boss!
No one dares oppose you!
Do what you want to.
Here on the streets!
Go for her!
Grab her!
Grab her...?
- No, I won't
This was all that was left!
You're a loafer.
And a drunkard!
You're a womaniser!
Now you're leader of the Eagle gang!
I'M not the leader.
- shame on you, SaMeer!
Forget her, boss.
There's one better than the other in Goa
Point out a girl.
She'll be in your arms
When there's Milk for the asking, why rear a cow, boss?
After a nice cold bath...
tommy will become a handsome boy
He'll be good looking.
Those dirty dogs in the lane...?
don't ever play with them, okay?
See how dirty you are
Good boy!
Good boy!
Bravo...
What's this?
A black dye?
So this isn't My tommy!
Hey... are you a wild dog?
rama!
The dog has bitten Me!
rama!
It isn't our tommy!
It's a duplicate of tommy!
SaMeer has given us a wild dog!
The black dye came off when I was giving it a bath!
Look!
I'M not sparing SaMeer!
He's Made the dog bite Me!
God!
He acts like a butcher!
After beating him black and blue, he's now setting the dogs after him!
He has no respect for his elders!
He'll need to take 14 injections in the stomach now
Go and take the first one.
- Go on...
Tiny injections they'll give him
SaMeer, I'M Raj, the astrologer
Here you are!
And I've been looking for you all over Goa l'M looking for SaMeer, too.
Let Me know if you find him I want to break his limbs!
- No... liquor isn't good for you!
- lt's blessed wine
Look!
Rani and SaMeer...
No!
It isn't Rani!
It's someone else
Really?
Very well
With you, I'll work wonders, O beautiful one
With you, I'll work wonders, O beautiful one
Let's rock to the Music, O beautiful one
"How shall you have Me...?"
"the whole world craves Me"
"The sight of you has driven Me out of My Mind, O beautiful one"
"Watch the wonders this boy is going to work, O beautiful one"
"come into My arms..."
"l'll show you the way to love"
"Take over My heart..."

"l'M one crazy Man..."
"who's not in his senses"
"Feed it to My lips..."
"all the venom you possess"
"lt's a trap laid by My beauty"
"lt's beyond comparison"
Having found you, I shall overcome, My love
"Watch the wonders this boy is going to work, O beautiful one"
With you, I could work wonders, O beautiful one
Let's rock to the Music, O beautiful one
"How shall you have Me?"
"The whole world covets Me"
"The sight of you drives Me out of My senses, O beautiful one"
"Watch the wonders this boy is going to work, O beautiful one"
Stop it, stop it...
Rickety old rickshaw!
- That'll be 40 rupees, Ma'aM
Here you are.
- But this is 20 Rupees
Every senior citizen gets a discount of 50 per cent
Whether it's the bus or a railway train
Besides, yours is a rickety old rickshaw!
grandma!
grandma is here!
Look at this kid!
He's calling Me a grandma!
SaMeer...

He's a bad boy!
- Why?
He ran away with My chocolate yesterday
And today, I will run away with your glasses!
Give My glasses to Me!
- l'M running away... come after Me!
My glasses...
- What's happening here?
Make this old fossil see reason, please
But he's My husband.
- What!
No, I'M her son!
- Son?
She's My mummy!
mummy, ask grandma to get Me a chocolate!
My darling son, give My glasses to Me
On one condition.
- What?
We'll play Cricket with it.
- l can't see anything!
I'll toss it up like a ball.
You Must catch it
Everyone in Rani's family hates Me.
That includes her dog, tommy
grandma, that's your grandson's love story then
Now you tell Me what I aM to do.
- My son... why Must you worry?
Now that I have arrived, everything will be all right
Just show Me the girl once. I'll go and talk it over with her, okay?
come, I'll show you.
- My son!
That's Rani, grandma
Where, son...?
- Over there, grandma
She's right there
Yes, yes...
- lsn't she beautiful?
Absolutely beautiful!
But I can't see a thing!
You go to the office and get on with your work, My son I'll go to her house and talk it over, okay?
Okay, grandma.
- Bye, son
My child...
- l'M here, Ma'aM
What spell have you cast on SaMeer?
- What?
He's Madly in love with you!
You're the only one he talks about, in everything he does
What are you talking about?
You know the Colonel...
My child, I know the Colonel is very angry with SaMeer
Once you agree to the wedding... the Colonel will have to get out of your way!
My child, do not be afraid.
If you're in love with SaMeer... not the Colonel and not any power in the world can separate you both!
SaMeer?
And rama?
My grandson will give you the bliss the Colonel never could if you're afraid of the Colonel, I'll help the two of you elope!
SaMeer hasn't come yet.
I wonder what's up
He'll come, grandma
Here he is.
- grandma...
Have you talked it over, grandma?
- Oh yes, son. I have
Very good.
Has Rani agreed?
- Yes, Rani has agreed
You now need to talk to her Mother and she'll bring the Colonel around
Make an eleven rupee offering.
And that'll be it!
grandma!
That's water!
The coffee's in this one here!
Ever since My glasses have broken, I can't see a single thing, My son
grandma, how could you have spoken to Rani then?
One uses his Mouth to speak, My son.
Not one's eyes
You Must've chosen right.
- Sure
How Many fingers, grandma?
- Four
Three... two...
- grandma!
I'M not totally blind yet, son.
I can still see a bit
And why Must you worry?
Go and talk it over with Rani's Mother
SaMeer!
Let Me have your glasses fixed, Ma'aM ln just a little while, we'll reach your in-laws' house
And here we are!
Praise the Colonel!
- What are you doing?
Holy water from St. Peter's church.
Go on.
Neither is the old Man there... nor is your future wife.
Go and talk it over with your future Mother-in-law!
Will she listen to Me?
- Of course
Just latch the door from inside!
- Why ?
Neither will she go out, nor will she send you out
Once the Matter is settled, unlatch the door.
Very simple
Go on. I'M right here!
SaMeer... why are you latching the door?
So that you don't send Me out of the house... nor leave the house yourself
Was this the time for this angel of death to return...?
What you're doing is wrong, SaMeer ls falling in love wrong?
I ask you... have you never been in love?
- Well, I...
You have, haven't you?
So why all the restrictions in My love?
Now look, SaMeer.
You...
SaMeer!
Where's SaMeer?
He's in there, with your wife
- What...?
You can't go inside till SaMeer's work is over
Till SaMeer's work is done...?
Give Me an opportunity. I have so Much to give in love!
I beg you, SaMeer.
Please go away
No.
Unless you agree, I can't go away lt'll take only two Minutes.
Let him do it, Colonel!
I'll see what he's upto!
Colonel!
Why're you so scared even after grandma has spoken to you?
The Colonel used to be a colonel.
And you are the colonel of this family lf you say yes, what can the colonel do about it?
For God's sake, leave My sari alone!
Let them get on with it!
If the youngsters run away, who'll lose face...?
Who'll get a bad name...?
- Get lost!
Your sari's stuck
Don't worry.
I'll have it freed
Look at the evil Man!
What are you thinking about, My child?
Now look, nothing like what you folks imagine, has happened
SaMeer did not Misbehave with Me I thought about it later
I think he had come to talk about you
He loves you very Much.
But whom do you love?
is it SaMeer?
Or Sunny?
I can't figure out anything.
Sunny's a very nice boy
I like SaMeer too.
But Papa doesn't
What am I to do...?
- Now look, My child
Don't worry about what Papa or I like
Think only about yourself lt's very difficult for Me to take a decision on this
What you Must see is who loves you More ls it SaMeer?
Or Sunny?
If you can't tell even that Much, then leave it to God
My red scarf flies away in the gust of wind...
My red scarf flies away in the gust of wind...
My beloved saw Me, oh how he deceived Me!
"He'll give Me his heart, I know.
But he'll also take My life"
Your red scarf flies away in the gust of wind
Your red scarf flies away in the gust of wind
"Your beloved has seen you...
oh, how he has deceived you"
"He'll give you his heart.
He'll lay down his life too"
"He'll give you his heart.
He'll lay down his life too"
How I tried to heart My pretty face ln a moment, however, the breeze had broken vigil
Your face has cast such a spell, My love...
"the sight of My Moon-like beauty, puts even the Moon to shame"
"Goodness!
I feel shy"
"Goodness!
I feel scared"
"come into My arms.
Let's not lose this opportunity"
"Your beloved has seen you.
Oh how you've been deceived"
"He'll give you his heart.
He'll lay down his life too"
"He'll give Me his heart, I know.
But he'll also take My life"
"There's a fragrance in the air.
It goads us on to fall in love"
My pretty beloved, acquiesce My love, please
"The fragrance of your love lingers even on My breath..."
"l've forsaken everything else, to follow in your footsteps"
Goodness!
You've fallen in love
Goodness!
You now admit it I'M not stopping now, however anyone Might try
My beloved saw Me, oh how he deceived Me!
"He'll give Me his heart, I know.
But he'll also take My life"
"He'll give you his heart.
He'll lay down his life too"
My red scarf flies away in the gust of wind...
Your red scarf flies away in the gust of wind
"Your beloved has seen you...
oh, how he has deceived you"
"He'll give Me his heart, I know.
But he'll also take My life"
"He'll give you his heart.
He'll lay down his life too"
My son, you came here in quest of peace
Where will you go now?
- l'll go to a place... where there are no people at all.
The AndaMan-Nicobar islands
You'll clash with a guy even if he's the only one around in town
Do what you will, but you can't change your destiny I know how Much you love Rani, My son
Will you leave her also and go away?
I'M not happy to leave I have to go away.
That's how the situation is
Let's go, grandma.
It's time the boat sailed
Look after yourself.
- SaMeer... well, well!
The priest, if not Rani, what say?
What's up?
- l'M leaving
Hey!
You can't leave Me and go away
Not you alone. I'M leaving this world behind
You've only seen Rani and Me getting together
Won't you stay for the wedding?
Guess who played the biggest role in bringing Rani and Me together?
He kept Making Mistakes and she kept getting closer to Me
Oh yes, that's a solid idea you gave Me!
Of publicly proposing to Rani!
Incidentally, India and Pakistan are playing a cricket Match today I've invited her father.
Rani will be there too I'M thinking of saying it to her in public!
Rani, will you Marry Me?
You're lucky... because I've stopped dreaming about Rani
Enjoy yourself
Fights, brawls, show of temper... and proposing to girls are things real Men do
I'd rather you play the guitar, SaMeer
Today's Match is going to be a terrific affair... because, for the first time, we have the Indian and Pakistani teams... playing a friendly Match in this stadium in Goa today
Paa-ji's here!
Get out of the way!
Where do you think you're going?
Get out!
Who's that in the stadium?
He's grabbed the Mike from Pa-ji I'll...
Rani!
Where are you?
He's come here, looking for Rani!
Who's Rani?
What's he shouting Rani for?
Who's she?
It has to do with the heart.
Keep it up, brave lad!
Go for her!
Looks like it has to do with love
Rani...
listen to Me...
Where're you hiding, sis-in-law?
The boss is so upset!
He'll find her.
He sure will.
- Sis-in-law!
Rani... where are you?
You Mess with My Mike?
You fight with Me?
Rani!
All I'll say is that you Mustn't Marry Sunny!
He's not worthy of you!
It's a question of your life!
Hold it, hold it... he has something to say.
Looks like it has to do with love
Here you are
Rani, I'M not the sort of guy you think I aM
Yes, I Made the Mistake of keeping My temper under control
Else, I'd have beaten Sunny black and blue and throw him out of Goa
But Sunny's done a wonderful thing today
He has stopped Me from going away
There's something I want to say to you, Rani
Rani... I love you
I have loved you ever since I first set eyes on you
Since the day the Colonel started hating Me
Colonel... I've Made a lot of Mistakes.
Please forgive Me
Rani, if you're not in love with Me... it's cool.
I'll go away
But I have a feeling that you do
That you do love Me
And thus, I publicly...
He's very upset!
I'M not asking for too Much.
I only want you to Marry Me... so that we can have a family.
We can have kids... who take after you in looks;
eyes, nose, lips, cheeks et al l only want them to have My surname... because My dad had the surname Malhotra
All I want to say to you is...
Ask her, "Will you Marry Me?" - l'll Marry you, if she doesn't!
Rani... will you Marry Me?
Louder!
Will you Marry Me?
Can't hear you!
Rani!
Will you Marry Me?
Will you Marry Me...?
Say yes, sister-in-law.
- Please say yes!
Rani, I think he's the right boy for you
He at least won't hit Me after he's Married to you
Say yes, girl!
Go on!
That's a spirited boy.
He's in love with you!
He's saying as Much in public.
So say yes!
Let the birds fly!
Say yes, sister-in-law!
Go on, My child.
Go!
Our kids will take after you in eyes and smile
And I like the surname Malhotra
Could I have the Mike, please?
As My Mother used to say... anger is love's worst enemy
One who can't control his temper, can't control anything in his lifetime
SaMeer, My Mother says, anger is love's worst enemy
One who can't control his temper, can't control anything in his lifetime
Not your Mother!
That's what My friend Arun's Mother used to say!
You remember what your friend used to say
But you've forgotten your friend?
You can't be Arun!
You're a scoundrel!
Arun was a gem of a guy!
Guess whose house I went to first, on My return from america... after 19 years?
Yours!
SaMeer's not here.
Who are you?
- lt's Me!
SaMeer's childhood friend.
Arun!
Good God!
Where's My buddy, grandma?
- He's away in Goa ls he still as hot-teMpered, or has he calmed down?
His temper has got worse with age, My son
grandma then told Me about your problem... how you had had a heart-break, how you had gone away to Goa...
Met Rani there and fallen in love with her... and how, for her sake, you had suppressed your anger
Okay then. I'll go and phone SaMeer
No, grandma.
You won't say a word to him I'M going to treat him not as his friend, but as his adversary
That's how I landed in Goa... to stay with your house, in your room, with you!
I now know why you did this all the time, buddy boy!
C'Mon!
The insolent!
- Go topless
Those with iron pajamas...
- Have an ape for an Uncle!
Whose aunts are cats...
- Have dogs for friends!
When it comes to the pickle...
- They hug, buddy!
The insolent!
- Go topless
Those with iron pajamas!
- Have an ape for an Uncle!
Whose aunts are cats...
- Have dogs for friends!
When it comes to the pickle...
- They hug, buddy!
What happened?
What's up now?
All over again!
What wrong have I done now?
- You're ill-fated, son I'M jinxed!
But nothing can go wrong now
The poor chap's been suffering all this while
For your sake, he has remained a bachelor
"You shall now become his bride..."
"Marry him"
"Marry him"
It seemed as if this chap was My tormentor
But he's the one who has shown Me the right path
"However, you are the one who shall become My bride"
You Must become his sister-in-law...
"you Must Marry Me"
It began in Florida.
America...
Here we come.
A challenge like no other.
Go that way.
- Right or left?
- Yeah.
Can Paris and Nicole get from Miami beach all the way home to Beverly Hills by driving themselves?
We don't have any money.
- Don't have money?
- No.
- Is this a real trailer park?
- Yes.
This is not how I wanted to wake up.
But after seven families...
You a liar!
You guys got that something-something.
Whose turn is it to rake the manure from underneath the chicken house?
It's theirs.
...Nine jobs...
Ew!
Oh, look at mrs.
Fancy-pants.
...and one burning question...
How many more miles to L.A.?
How the (bleep) should I know?
Tonight, with over 1,200 miles to go...
Oh, my god, this is the same way.
...And three states to cross...
Are you joking with the driving?
...can paris and nicole finally make it home?
- Are you on the freeway?
- I don't know.
Maybe.
Good luck, girls.
So tired.
We've been driving forever.
Stop the car,
Stop the car!
Go like that.
It's attracted to the light.
Hold on.
Is it gone?
Roll up your window.
I hate this.
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god, oh, my god.
It's still there.
I thought I killed it.
Gone.
It's gone, it's gone.
Great.
Killed it with my Chanel.
That's hot.
Let's take two girls both filthy rich
Isn't that Paris Hilton?
From the bright lights into the sticks from velvet ropes to cattle pulls let's take away their limousines their credit cards and shopping sprees well, they're both spoiled rotten will they cry when they hit bottom?
Heaven knows if they'll survive this simple road trip kind of life.
Where the hell are we?
Well, this is it:
The final leg of the girls' cross-country trip, right here in Kerrville, Texas.
I can't believe this trip's almost over.
As long as they can finish their next job, there's nothing that can stop 'em from making it home.
- We ran out of gas.
- Shut up.
I swear on my life.
Press the gas.
Go, like...
It's really funny.
Okay.
Ew, there's bugs everywhere.
What were you looking for?
The, like, the thing to open the thing.
Like, if there was an engine problem, maybe you'd look in the front, but there's not.
What do we do-- we're in the middle of nowhere.
Nicole, flag this person down.
Hello?
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Hi.
We're stuck.
We ran out of gas.
- Y'all need a ride?
- Yeah.
- All right, get in, girls.
- Thank you.
Y'all get in the back so they can get in.
- Hi, guys, I'm Paris.
- I'm Nicole.
- Welcome to the Y-O.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
I don't even know where I am.
- What kind of place is this?
- A ranch.
Did y'all see any animals when y'all came in?
- What animals are here?
- All kinds of deer and longhorn cattle.
How do they know to stay here?
We have a feet-high fence that tells 'em to.
See this bible?
Do y'all know what this kind of skin is?
No.
Deer?
It's a dead animal on a bible?
That's a little ironic, don't you think?
Not if you read the bible, it's not.
My name is Missy Dries.
I'm the Y-O ranch tours director.
I'm expecting Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie to come out to the ranch.
Looking forward to having a lot of fun.
I'm Missy.
Welcome to the ranch.
- I heard you guys ran out of gas.
- Yeah.
I've got gas in my truck.
Why don't you just get in my truck with me, and I'll take you to where your truck is.
- Will that work ?
- Sure.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Bye.
- Bye, boys.
- What is this place?
- Well, it's a working ranch.
Have you guys never heard of the Y-O ranch?
No.
Well, you guys are in for a real treat.
You'll see a bunch of real cowboys.
I really don't know that they're cut out to do this line of work.
That's cute.
Look, they have, like, little cabins.
It takes someone with a lot of tough skin and nerve to live the cowboy way of life.
What?
!
What did you do?
Where is it?
!
Paris, are you okay?
What is it-- it's going to climb on me.
It's a stick.
There is no bug.
I do not see a bug.
No, it was a bug with legs moving its butt around.
I hate this.
Oh, my god.
Well, what do you want to do?
- You want to ride in the front?
- Yes.
Get your stuff up there.
- Those are your shoes?
- My shoe broke.
Nicole and Paris are going to have to toughen up if they're going to get through this.
So brutal.
I think it's funny that you guys really ran out of gas.
- Hello, ladies.
Murph's my name.
- Hello.
Paris.
Jim Murph is our trail boss.
He's going to be with us today.
I've been here at the Y-O ranch probably about 25 years.
I'm out here in wide open range on this 40,000-acre ranch.
Couldn't get any better.
It's a Murph special.
I'll have a latte.
- You guys have lattes here?
- No, just playing.
- Are you kidding?
- Not on a working ranch.
We have a big day planned for you girls.
Basically, what we're going to do is drive some cattle about three miles down the road, and, um, we need to get going here pretty quick if we're going to get done before noon tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow.
All night till tomorrow?
- I do mean all night till tomorrow.
- Yeah, right.
- I'm not kidding.
- "Yeah, right."
- Are we walking?
- No, no, we'll be on horseback.
She just had a little incident.
- What happened?
- I got thrown off a horse.
- Did you really?
- And it ran me over.
It really hurts.
- Did you get back on?
- Not yet.
Really?
You didn't get back on after you fell off?
No.
I got airlifted to the hospital in a helicopter.
Wow.
Well, what a good opportunity for you to get back on a horse.
You girls are about to live the legend.
All right, we're going to brand some cattle first.
It's so mean.
Girls, the reason we brand is because it's a sign of ownership.
Better get over here where you can see.
I have nine tattoos, and I have never been in this much pain.
Let him up, boys.
It's a necessity.
Every rancher does it.
Not only is it the cowboy way, it's what we're going to do today.
I'm an animal activist, and I really won't do it, so...
I don't believe in that.
I think it's wrong.
I don't want to do it.
These calves have to be branded with the Y-O to be identified.
So, you just need to make sure you get the job done.
- We have another idea.
- Another idea?
They'll be marked, but not your way.
- What other way are you talking?
- The Beverly Hills way.
Animal friendly.
The neighbors are going to laugh at us.
It looks much better.
You guys should always do it this way.
Yeah.
These are 1,500-pound animals with seven-foot horns, and y'all are putting hearts on them.
And named him Billy.
- Billy?
- Yup.
He's farting.
Poor thing.
You wrote "poop" on it?
"Poop," and a little arrow.
That's mean.
Where the poop comes from.
How'd you like it if someone wrote "poop" on butt?
We're going to do this.
Let's get you girls on your horses.
Paris, are you ready?
They want me to get back on a horse, and I'm a little nervous, so...
I don't really know what to do.
It's your call.
We'd like to really encourage you to ride.
I know that you've come off before.
What's the old saying?
If you fall off a horse, you get up, dust yourself off and you try again.
Unless you get picked up in a helicopter and flown to a hospital.
That's tradition out here.
It's pretty much the cowboy way.
Let's just...
I'll do it.
- Really?
- Yeah.
All right.
I've got to admire you.
A lot of people won't get back on after they been throwed off.
Whatever happens, if you get right back on, you'll lose that fear a lot quicker.
She cowboyed up-
- I'll have to give her that.
I was very proud of her.
..Okay?
Yeah.
He's nice.
- Is this y'all's first trail drive?
- Yeah.
I've seen movies like it.
All right, let's go.
Move them this way, slow!
Go!
Move your big, freckled asses.
Go!
Go!
Move it!
Go!
They're not listening.
This way, girls.
Get behind all of them!
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Good cows.
Let's go, guys!
Head 'em up!
Move them to the right a little, guys!
Whoo!
All right, girls, it's y'all's turn to call.
Okay, what do I do?
Say "sook."
Sook!
Perfect, perfect.
Whoo!
Sook, come on.
Sook!
Sook, I said!
He's leaving.
Hey!
Hey!
Uh-oh.
Look how cute Bill is.
Freckle-puss.
How much further is it?
We have a little ways.
All day, dear.
Are we halfway done, or no?
- No.
We just got started.
- Oh.
I'm falling asleep on the horse.
Can we take a nap?
How much farther is it?
Oh, it's about five, six miles.
You keep saying "around the bend."
We went around, like, 50 bends since you said that.
Are we going to stop for lunch?
A little picnic?
Is there sandwiches, or anything?
This way, girls.
I'm over this.
Let's just take the horses and peace out.
Let's go, guys!
Head 'em up!
- That's a good hiding spot.
- Yeah, it is.
Girls, where'd y'all go?
!
Girls!
Girls!
My legs are killing me.
I need to stretch.
I'm getting off.
Our horses ran away.
You girls need to understand something real quick.
This is a 40,000-acre ranch.
If I hadn't looked up because those steers were getting away,
I would have never found you guys.
The herd is leaving.
They've got them scattered all over the place, and I need you guys to help us get them back.
Okay.
The herd is way over there.
Can you hear them from here?
We know where it is.
I'm following you, then.
Okay.
Go, horsie.
Get him, Paris.
Get that spotted one right there.
Let's go.
Move it!
Nicole, there's one behind you.
Go!
Girls, that was probably some of the best work I've seen you do all day.
Thank you.
Where's the nearest bathroom?
Anyone want a s'more?
Ew.
It's good.
This seems fun.
You guys get to just, like, ride horses and, like, sit by the fire with your friends, and you get paid for it.
It definitely is a different way of like-- something that we're all accustomed to.
I mean, we were all born and raised, you know, country folks.
You guys have never been to L.A.?
Never been to L.A.
I've never been to L.A.
- New York?
- Miami?
- Never been to Miami.
- Negative, negative.
We spend 360 days a year right here.
You guys got to just see it, at least.
For what?
What do you mean, "for what?"
We got out of the city to come here.
Well, life on the open range begins at daybreak, so everyone's up and ready to go.
You guys ready?
Well, almost everyone.
Come on, we're burning daylight.
We're ready to go.
Where's our cow?
Y'all's cow?
I don't know.
I seen him when we left the trap back there.
Eh, he's still back there.
Wild Billy.
Why don't you guys just drive them in a truck instead of doing it this way?
Well, look at the terrain area they're in.
We can't get a truck and trailer down here.
And what are you going to do with them when they get over here?
We're gonna go to slaughter.
What?
Ours?
Billy?
We don't want that to happen.
- What?
- They're going to kill Bill.
Oh, my god.
You guys can't kill him.
Well...
We painted him.
- He's ours.
- Life is tough.
Don't crowd 'em too much, now.
Just stay out the way of them.
Push 'em on up, Missy.
Ooh.
There's Bill.
There's Bill.
Somebody needs to shut that gate and stay at it.
I hear the truck coming right now.
- I really feel bad for the cows.
- I know, they're killing all of them.
I know.
We should say something.
What are we going to say, it's a cow farm.
Look here, miss, you understand, we're not going to pay y'all but for one day.
We had two days of work here, but y'all kind of slacked up on us, and so, uh, here's for the one day instead of two days.
I hope that will work for you.
We really want to keep Bill.
Yeah, we don't want you to take him.
He's going on that trailer.
What if we give this as a down payment?
The steer belong to somebody else though.
We've contracted them out.
We can break the contract.
That always happens in Hollywood.
This is not Hollywood, kid.
The only thing that I can imagine is that they would want to keep him as a... pet in their front yard.
And... animals aren't pets, they're animals.
What if we pay double?
It'd be a good deal.
I think I'd bargain for it.
Surely they're good for their word.
They look like they are.
- Let's do it.
- All right.
Thanks.
- That's a deal then.
- It's a deal.
We can turn ol' Bill out.
I'd rather have a hug from you good lookin' girls than just a handshake.
I can't hardly see them girls gettin' out and feeding' him and shoveling' (bleep) and cleaning his stall and everything, but they would pay somebody to do it.
There goes Bill.
I don't think I'd ever like the girls to come back and help us work here on the ranch.
Um, I think it cost us more money to have them work out here than it would be for us to just have our regular crew.
Hey, Murph.
Can I have $20 for gas?
"Can I have $20?"
I always was a sucker for a beautiful woman.
Well, with the cattle drive over, the girls are ready for the most important drive of all.
- We're going home.
- Thank god.
This road trip has been very, very interesting.
We had fun.
Airstream big chrome airstream leave the world behind me but it was kind of neat just to, like, see all of America.
In my airstream free, I don't wanna be
I love this horse.
Stuck in the city with the cars and people downtown waiting in a line wishing I was far away where no one knows my name.
It's so funny.
Who's been your favorite family?
I liked the Cash family.
They were cool, how they, like, sang all the time.
Every family's been so different.
Bye!
Free, I don't wanna be stuck in the city with the cars and people downtown...
We drove all the way from Florida to California.
You mean I drove from Florida to California.
But you were with me.
I can't believe we did it.
Hi, everyone.
We're back.
I think she missed her cell phone.
I think she missed her house.
Hopefully, she missed me.
Hi, mom.
Paris is an adventurous girl.
And I can tell you right now, she is having a blast.
I think she would do it again in a minute.
Is this really it?
Paris!
Can you imagine me and Nicole in this bed for a month?
No.
This time around, who was more of the troublemaker?
No, 'cause we both, like, feed off of each other's energies.
It's totally understandable that they would do this together.
I could not see Paris doing it with anyone else.
And I couldn't see Nicole doing it with anyone else.
We're so happy you came to our party.
We're happy to be home, and we had a great time on the road.
And to all of you who think we couldn't do it... ..we did it.
Well, it's been a long, hard road, but the girls are finally home and back to their normal lives.
I'm so glad to be home.
Loves it.
Loves it.
Loves it.
- Excuse me, miss Hilton?
- Yes.
You and miss Richie have a guest.
- Who?
- Who?
Will be right out.
Yay, Billy's here.
Come here, you sexy bitch.
He's so big.
Where do I sign?
Welcome to L.A., Bill.
Welcome home.
Miss hilton, you must be worth a trillion bucks
Can we give him away now?
Get the feelin' that you don't really give a...
I hate him.
You've got to keep Paris away from the animals.
- My name's Gloria, for what it's worth ...and yours?
- Barros...
Andrés Barros...
- Don't worry... your buddies already paid for it...
Oh yeah, that's right... well, Gloria, I don't know what you charge, but you're worth double.
- Very nice, Andrés Barros...
- Thank you...
- Roberto?
Hey man!
They go and pay the whole deal, what's up with that?
Call me later, bye.
- Great night, wasn't it?
- Hi!
- Hi
- You didn't tell me you were going to show up.
- I can leave, if you want...
- Oh no!
No, no
- Hello
- Hello honey
- Come in, sit down, sorry about the mess.
- So how did it go last night at your bachelor party?
- Not bad... you know how much those guys drink...
- ¿Where did you go?
- You should talk about that with my lawyerok?
- Oh, I'd rather not know,
did you really forget our breakfast plans?
- What?
- I came to pick you up for breakfast, then I was going to drop you of at the office.
- Of course I remember...
- Come on honey, hurry up we're late!
- Yeah sure...
- Hurry up...!
- Ok, ok...
- Come on!
...and that's only for this year...
We really think we've made a good investment.
- We agree.
This contract is very important for us, too...
Yes, and we'd like to thank you for your confidence and for your investment... you know, I think you've made an excellent decision.
- Ok...
- It was great meeting you.
- And you.
- Have a good trip, bye.
- It was a pleasure...
- And good luck.
- Thanks.
We'll keep in touch...
- Ok.
- Ok, bye...
- Bye, congratulations.
Hope all goes well.
Héctor, please take them to the elevator...
Héctor will help you...
- Perfect!
Next week, we'll sign the papers.
- Fuck man, it's a lot of money!
A lot... you take charge of the changes to the contract, ok?
... and how about last night?
- Oh!
Fine, fine...
and thanks for paying, it really wasn't necessary...
- It was our "fucking" gift, don't you remember?
- I know, I know...
- Or do you feel... a little guilty Mr. Barros?
- What are you talking about?
- That's what I'm talking about!
Two, fifteen...
I think the good life has really got a hold on you, man!
What good life?
Work, and more work, what life is that?
Come on, don't be ungrateful, you're closer than ever to signing the contract of your life... by the way, when are you flying to BuenosAires?
The day after tomorrow, I think... but it won't be a real "trip".
I mean I'll land there, get the signatures and fly back the same evening.
Take it easy,
I only meant to say that you seem a little edgy...
Hi guys!
- Congratulations my friend!
How's it goin'
- How you doing man?
- ¿How about your special night?
- What do you expect?
Nice, of course...
- Yes, nice...
not bad...
- You must be crazy.
That girl is amazing!
I'd like to thank you for your gift, it was a real nice gesture, but you shouldn't have gotten
- Wait, wait, wait!
Sorry, but you don't have to thank us for anything.
We only hope you enjoyed it.
- Well, I think he'd like to repeat...
Oh man, you shouldn't!
Look, on one hand we've got our bachelor parties, but marriage is another thing all together ok?
And, in the other hand, we have our marriage
- Yes sir!
Like us, indeed!
Come on!
What's up with you guys?
Change gears okay?
You'd think you'd been locked up for ten years come on, let's get out of here.
Shut up, ok?
- No comments about this.
- Sure, don't worry...
- And you played well
- ¿Andrés Barros?
- Mr. Barros, There's a young woman waiting for you.
- Gloria
- Mrs...
Gloria
- (off) tell her to come in.
- This way, please.
To your left.
- Thanks...
- Good evening sir, am I interrupting you?
- You should have checked with me first...
How can I help you?
- I just need a lawyer
Look, right know we're completely booked, but I can give you the number of a friend.
I only need some advice if you understand... nobody has to know about this, if you don't want to
If you could answer some questions for me...
I can pay however you prefer ...Heh, what's up?
You didn't enjoy your time with me?
Why don't we go to my place?
...Let's go...
Andrés, it's Rosario speaking...
What's up, honey?
I'm still waiting for your call, we're supposed to have dinner with my parents tonight
I know you're there
- I so call me honey...
love you.
- I really love you...
- Morning
- I'm going up to 406.
- ¿Why didn't you let me know you were coming?
I mean, I could have been with a client.
- ¿What happened to your face?
- Somebody wants to kill me.
- ¿Who is "somebody"?
His name is Carlos, he was a client, we had an affaire, you know... but please, you can't tell anybody about this, ok?
Look, we can take this to the court, we can put a restriction on the guy and I'll talk to my partner... no, no, no, please no!
I mean...
I just thought you could give me some advice, nothing else...
I'm sorry...
- It's ok... shh...
- That was Carlos, wasn't it?
- I...
I really want you to go...
- Hey, wait, wait a second!
I don't understand!
- Go!
Please, go!
Listen to me, listen!
I don't really care about you, ok?
It doesn't matter to me so don't be calling me at home telling me about your problems
...Ok, ok, ok, take it easy... take it easy...
Nothing is going to happen to you.
Listen to me.
Look, I just want you to tell me... what's going on.
- Hey honey...

¿Could you stay here with Roberto?
I want to introduce Peter to some Friends ...

Congratulations Peter
- Thank you very much.
- ¿Everything ok?
- Just great...
look at your cousin... what else could I ask for?
And me... the jewel of our family with my best friend, it sounds perfect
¿Who invited her?
Rosario did, she felt sorry for her,
Carolina always looks so sad.
- Wait for me just a second.
- Wait, wait, wait, stop, wait a second,
Sorry but I don't feel...
Listen to me...
- Leave me alone!
- Come on honey...
- You don't even realize that I'm really trying!

These things happen, don't exaggerate it!
Don't exaggerate!
I've been calling you all day, you disappear, I can't find you anywhere.
I was working.
Is that so strange?
-
Right, working.
Oh please
Look at me boy!
If I ever find out that you are cheating on me... you know what I mean, you have no idea what I'm capable of.
Rosario, please!
You know me, don't you?
I don't understand why you're bringing all of this up now

Don't you realize that I'm flying to BuenosAires early tomorrow morning?
- Why don't you leave right now!
- Remember that those are your own words
- Good evening Mr. Barros , It's your travel agent, Maria Angelica speaking

...Yeah!
And I gave you a key so you could come here when things are bad, when you're worn out.
I want you to leave...
I'm so tired and...

Something to drink?
¡Fuck, how is it possible?

Two days to go, then I get back and look at this!

- No, please!
- ¡You killed her!
- How could I?
I just got here!
- You killed her, son of the bitch you killed her!
- Please listen to me, I did not!
- Yes you did!
You piece of shit you killed her!
I was just arriving when...
- You did it!
... ou did it!
Yes you did!
No, no, no, please,
I just arrived,
I have my passport here, please!
- Don't move!
What are you doing?
- My passport, it's my passport...
- Don't move, don't move!
Please don't shoot.
Can't you see?
I just arrived, just arrived,
I have nothing to do with her... she called me, I'm... you know,
I was a client, I'm a lawyer so she asked me for a little help because she had problems with a client of hers, mean, she didn't want to see him any more
And who you are?
For you I'm Ernesto,
and my version is the truth from this moment, you got me?
If I wanted to I could shot you right here...
like this or like this...
I can do that so cool, so smooth... eh?
Then I can put this in your hand and you "committed suicide",
and tomorrow the papers will look after the confusion
Nobody can get here and kill her for free, even if she's just a slut who you wanted to fuck,
you're up to your neck in this one fucker
If you aren't Carlos, you're gonna help me find him
Me
- I was never here
I don't exist here,.
Your prints are everywhere, all through this apartment.
You with me?
- Take her.
- Over there.
Turn off the water
come on...
What have you got there?
Change your t-shirt
put your hands on the table... take the cell phone no, no, leave your bag there...
close the door, close it.
- Over there... over there, come on...
- To the red car, over there, move it...
- What perfume to you use fucker?
- English lavender...
it's cologne
Cologne... you know she told me that... she told me that nobody kissed her like him...
Carlos... the bastard...
son of a bitch...
- I don't understand.
- Bitches never kiss, Mr. Lawyer... they only kiss the men they love...
Did she kiss you?
- No...
- What did she do for you?
Ok, you know what we're gonna do?
I'm not gonna take the stuf out of her apartment,
I'm not gonna clean it up,
I'm not gonna give your stuff back until you've helped me find Carlos.
Ok?
- Rosario!
What's wrong?
Do you need anything?
Ok.
We have three days, maybe four since she's under water, then she'll start to smell bad.
I don't know where to start!
You probably have a much better idea of where to find him.
- That's the deal.
I stand by my word.
Get out, get out!
- How can I get in touch with you?
- I have your documents, you're info,
I'll call you.
- I couldn't make anyone happy Roberto...
Why didn't I fall in love with you?
- Rosario, please.
...look, we'll clear this up,
I'll findAndrés and then call you, ok?
- Fuck him!
He can disappear for all I care!
- Don't say that.
- It's always you who ends up consoling me.
- That's what I'm here for.
- Okay, talk with him but, don't tell him about the videotape.
Ok, ok, but this could be a "misse an scene",
I've seen several similar cases.
Think about that.
Roberto, I'm not a little girl, ok?
I know what I'm talking about... you always warned me not to get involved with him because he'd make me suffer,
now look at me...
Take it easy, ok?
I'll find him and then call you.
Why don't you answer me?
Ernesto, man,
I've been calling for two days straight and.
I need the money, the fifteen million, you know
My son will visit you tomorrow, ok?
Give him the money fucker.
Hello...
Andrés...
Where have you been man?
Why did you take so long to get to BuenosAires?
...
What's the matter with you?
Where are you now?
Listen, Rosario knows about your affair with the hooker,
I covered your ass man, but if you don't call her soon you're fucked
Andres?
Hello?
- Hello?
So your fiancés name is Rosario?
Is it true that she's the owner... of that very famous art gallery?
What's it called?
- Where did you get that information?
I got it the same place that I found out you work for that successful law firm.
Now listen I need to meet you the day after tomorrow.
But, you gave me three days, it was a deal...
Change of plan,.
Things are gonna start getting ugly
Have you got anything on Carlos?
How can I, I don't even know who he is!
You could do that.
- But I don't exist here buddy, look,
I think it's very clear,
I'll shut my mouth, but you have to be a good boy, ok?
You better do as I say, first of all you find Carlos, then you get me some cash...
- Cash?
- That's right, cash.
Don't tell me you haven't got any?
Of course not, you've got my credit cards, my documents, everything.
I haven't got a thing!
Wait, wait, wait.
You think I'm gonna clean up that apartment for free?
I'm not talkin' about change for the bus,
I'm talkin' about fifteen million pesos.
- Fifteen millions...
in cash!
Are you kidding?
Where do you think I'm gonna get that kind of money?
How much do you think it's worth... to get your life back?
.
I'll call you and let you know where and when, otherwise I'll talk with your pretty bride
You son of the bitch!
If you put a hand on her...
I'll...
Hello... hello?
What are you doing here?
I called you but your cell phone was out.
What's with you?
- She was unconscious when I got there...
- So you heard them fucking, and you went in to take a look?
- Well... yes, I did... but...
- But what?
Is that how it was or not?
- Ok, you're right, that's what happened.
Do you realize?
... we have no defense...
You're fucked.
I don't know what the fuck you went in there for
- Well, you know...
I don't know, really...
I felt like she was threatening me, maybe I wanted to get my card back.
I mean to erase my self from there...
I really don't know man...
- What went on between you and that girl?
"
- Wait; wait... if you think I killed her"
why don't you call the police now ok?
- Good morning.
I'd like to file a report.
Stop!
...
What's the matter with you, man?
Why are you doing this?
I'm putting myself in the place of the judge
This is what will happen to you if you don't do exactly what I say.
- Ok, ok, whatever you say.
- Did you get a look at that guy?
Carlos?
No, I didn't.
Well, you know I think it was him who left through the emergency door when I got there but, I didn't actually see him.
So we have no information on him.
That's probably just a name he gave to the hooker.
I think Ernesto is Carlos... well, maybe not, maybe he gave me that name to throw me off.
I think he's trying to gain time,
I think he's planning to leave the country
Shit, I don't know,
I've been thinking a lot since yesterday evening.
Look, it doesn't matter if we don't find that Carlos guy, ok?
Ernesto wants money, and we need your bag and all stufs back from that apartment.
- I don't care about the money,.
But Rosario... that's what I'm worried about
How did she get dragged into this?
Well, somebody sent her a security video with you and the girl in the elevator
Shit!
What's this, man?
...
Wait, wait, and wait if you appear on that videotape then there are probably some more
Images of the day she was murdered.
- That doorman is a strange guy.
He should have copies of the videotapes.
Then we've got to get the tapes from him now
Tell me where to find him, and I'm gone.
You stay here and try to relax.
Don't go anywhere.
Here in Santiago.
I'll figure out what to say to the doorman.
Your best defense is that no one knows you're Not even Rosario.
- How is she?
- Bad, but for now it's better that she stays out of this.
Anything you get on them, call me, ok?
Ernesto and Gloria, there must be some information.
- I just got your copies...
Juan...
- please follow me.
- Ok.
ROBERTO WE HAVE TO TALK, HERE, TOMORROW EVENING.
YOU BETTER SEE THIS, I HAVE COPIES
Rosario... it's Roberto...
I foundAndrés, he's in BuenosAires, his flight was late...
Listen Rosario, everything will be ok, don't worry... please call me, I need to talk to you
Andrés?
... hello man!
You just up and left the other day
What's up?
You don't like my car, or something?
Listen, we're friends, aren't we?
Tell me, did you get BuenosAires, or not?
- No, not yet...
- Shit, man!
I figured you were there dancing tango, having a drink, a steak, fucking girls.
Is it true that those assholes mix water in with their wine?
Haven't you left yet?
- Too much workman, too much work.
Hey honey!
The other side, please!
...
Do I have to explain everything?
No, no, no man, you're so wrong, how many times have I told you?
Life is for living fucking girls, drinking,
By the way, how's married life?
What's new with Rosario?
She's fine, really, we're not gonna go to see how hard they fucked your beautiful "friend" again
What a crazy girl, man!
...
They
Listen man, I gotta go now, ok?
Really messed her up bad ... and then she sucked harder and swallowed!
She likes the "venom"!
Well, listen brother, I've gotta go, phone cards aren't free you know, and I'm in the middle of an important deal.
If you need anything just give me a call...
later
- Something to drink?
- No, no, no, talk to me.
I talked with a friend at Court, she told me about a prostitute named Gloria.
She was arrested a long time ago with her friend Ernesto Bahamondes, a hotel manager.
- That's them
- Of course it is!
- Where did you get this?
Well, I talked with that doorman, he lied and lied, he said that he has nothing to do with that videotapes...
When I got to my office, I found this tape
- Did you see it?
- Yes...
I saw everything...
Rosario's in it.
- What?
- Images don't lie.
- What are you talking about?
I really don't know but I think... she watched that videotape where you appear with that girl, ok?
She got furious, she went to talk to her, they had a wrangle or something... you know... it could be an accident.
But... how is it possible...
Rosario... who the hell sent you this tape?
...
Ernesto, he's fucking with us... shit!
What the fuck are we gonna do now?
We have to get the tapes from Ernesto.
If Rosario is guilty?
We have to protect her.
We both know she's no murderer, this was an accident.
- We have to get that apartment, right now
We have to get rid of the prints
Ernesto killed that girl, I have no doubt about it, now
- Listen Roberto, you don't have to get mixed up in this.
- Tell those bastards that I'm not in Santiago.
- Hi
- Hi, where's your boss?
- I really don't know, he's out from the city, I think.
- Hi, It's Rosario, please leave me a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible, thanks.
- Hello Rosario, you don't know me... my name is Ernesto, I'm a friend of Andrés
I needto talk to you.
I need to meet you, actually
- Hello?
- Ernesto, I finally get to meet you, man!
- Hello Mr. Ernesto, we were looking for you ...here, here!
- I just talked with your father boy...
I'll get the money tomorrow.
- You're a fucking idiot Ernesto, why in the hell did you take on a debt like that?
Look, if it were up to me I wouldn't give you one more day ...Let's see guys... in any case I don't think you'll get fifteen million together by tomorrow.
What do the rest of you think?
- Of course not, where from?
Give me your hand...
your hand, man!
...
Look ...fifteen millions peso tomorrow... my friend.
- Calm down man, you'll talk with her...
Where's your date with Ernesto tomorrow?
- On the street, in front of our ofice...
No way man, we've got to get him upstairs... and he has to bring us the videotapes... at about half past six, there's usually nobody around at that time,
Shit!
...
I don't know the number
I bet it's him...
should I answer?
...Hello?
Yes!
Yes, yes... yes, of course I've got your money... and Carlos, too ...yes, sure, but there will be a little change,
Listen, you'll have to come up to my office, ok?
No, later, at a half past six, eleventh floor,
No, later, at a half past six, eleventh floor, bring the videotapes with you, don't forget... well, the one you sent to Rosario and the other one
What?
Oh, no, no, no!
Ok!
Ok!
Whatever you say!
I've got it!
Sure I have but, please listen to me, I!
...
Hello?
...
He'll be in the street at five o'clock, he says he has no idea about the videotapes...
- What about Carlos?
- He wants the money at first, then he wants Carlos.
- Sure, you give him the money and then he kills you 'cause you don't have any Carlos...
No, this is the plan, first he give me my documents back and then we give him the money, then we can tell him a story about Carlos... now we've got to clean that apartment...
- ¡Oh shit, Andrés!
- Shit!
- He's absolutely crazy, man!
- I'm going to bed.
I'm exhausted.
- I'll wait till it turns of.
- Your bill.
I don't know, I'll call back... well Andres you'll have to meet him, on the street what else can we do?
We won't get anywhere on the street... you'll have to go down and convince him to come up...
Look, he drives a sport red car, 80's style, you know, very ordinary.
...He's easy to recognize, he's bald tell him you're my lawye and a good friend of mine, and that you helped me find Carlos then tell him that we have the money but,
first, he has to give us the keys to the apartment and the videotapes too, of course
you have to convince him.
Hey Mr. Lawyer, what's up?
.
What's up, you bastard?
Who's this idiot you sent?
Am I speaking Chinese, or do you not understand what I said?
I'm not going up to your fucking ofice okay?
And I haven't got any fucking videotapes
- Mr. Roberto, I'm off.
- Whatever you want...
- Son of a bitch!
He's gone crazy, man!
He just called me and denied everything!
- I know, he got away!
Find him you fucker!
- Fuck!
He won't answer!
- Shit... shit!
- Hey, wait!
What's wrong?
Have you gone mad?
We need to change our plan, Andrés.
We can't let this guy tell us... how things are done.
Wait, wait...
I won't...
I mean, I'm not gonna...
Don't count me in on this don't you remember you're a lawyer?
What if someone else is involved, if someone else is giving us the run around?
But... think, man, he's the only one who appears on the videotape...
Ernesto is doing this to save his own ass.
- Hi!
...
Yeah, it's me...
Why didn't you show up last night?
Right now?
No, no, wait!
...
Ok.
- I don't know how you think it's gonna helpAndres by giving me these videos.
- That's what I wanted to talk to you about last night.
- But you didn't show up.
- I ran into some problems, that's all... and... what are on those tapes anyway?
- You know as well as I do you're the one who sent them.
- I didn't send you anything...
What's on the tapes?
- They show Andres and the dead woman in the elevator...
- Gloria was her name, ok?
And what else?
Oh, give me a break, I'm not gonna give you all the details.
You know what?
If we got hold of the other tapes from that day we could find out who killed Gloria
Sorry but, did you fuck on a sport red car anytime?
Do you know what we're gonna do?
You're going to drive us straight to... the office of your boyfriend,
Ok?
But first we're gonna make a little phone call.
- Hello?
...
Rosario?
- Andrés!
...
Andrés, please, do what he says, I can't take this!
- Hello, Mr. Lawyer?
You listen to me son of a bitch!
If anything happens to her I'll kill you.
You hear me!
Yes, I have all your fucking money...
He has Rosario, they're coming here...
- Shit!
...
- Ok, ok, yes, first floor.
I'll go down to meet them.
- Be careful.
- Sure.
- Ok!
Calm down, please!
This isn't necessary!
Ok?
- Stop, stop, stop, stop!
Over there, come on!
Carlos will be here any minute!
You arrived before him, he has no you even exist.
- I don't give a shit about Carlos, I'm in a hurry.
Carlos isn't what interests me,
I want the money and all of the videotapes you have.
- But...
I don't have the videos, you've got them haven't you?
- Who is Carlos?
- Shut up, bitch!
Wait, wait, wait a second!
"Somebody's sending those videotapes;
I really thought it was you... "
Ernesto, look, let's finish this right now, give me my documents, and I'll give you your money.
That's it, ok?
I really like your speech Mr. Lawyer but, I don't think you understand... give me my money, then I give you your documents and your "wife" comes with me, as a "plus", then
I disappear.
- She wasn't part of our deal, man!
- We have a "new deal" now!
Come on, stand up, stand up you bitch!
The money, give me the money!
Ok, ok, ok, sure...
here it is... all the money, please let her go
Ernesto, please, listen to me, let her go!
Please!
- I'll take your girl, boy!
Maybe she'll learn a few things with me!
- Let me go!
- Hey!
- Ok, ok, you calm down, calm down... it's all over...
- We're really fucked now.
- What did you want me to do?
- Are you crazy?
He wasn't going to shoot me!
And what about Rosario?
Were you going to let him just take her?
He was just a fucking pimp anyway
- What are you doing here?
- You read my note, didn't you?
... ...I sent the tapes to them, to show them what kind of person are you Roberto.
- What will you do now?
- What's on that tape?
- That you also visited that apartment.
Stop, I didn't kill anybody!
...
I...
I only wanted to confront her... face to face but... it was too late when I arrived.
- But that's not all.
- Give me the tape.
It's over, this has already caused enough problems.
- What are you doing, man?
- Stop!
Stop it!
Give me that!
You know?
It wasn't a surprise to me, at all,
I expected just about anything from him.
You have no idea who he really isAndrés.
- ¡Roberto, Roberto!
Stop there, this is not a game!
What are you gonna do now?
.
You wanna kill me or something?
You wanna fuck your life up because of me?
...
Ernesto is our scapegoat, or don't you remember?
- No...
You're going to have to explain a few things.
- I don't think it's to your advantage.
- Call the police.
What about me?
...I sent that videotapes.
Nothing will happen to you, I'm not going to denounce you?
So, are you going to call or shall I?
- Oh, please, don't kill meAndrés!
Please...
- I'm not like you.
I won't shoot.
Even though you don't know it you're right.
Isn't that true Rosario sweetie?
Tell your fiancé.
Tell him how hard we fucked.
- Roberto, stop
- What are you talking about you son of a bitch?
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, my mother was not a bitch, but your bride certainly is!
The bitches were the ones you fucked while you made me watch!
...
You did the same with Carolina, didn't you?
I can't take it any more.
I knew Gloria.
- What kind of shit is this Rosario?
- A couple of times I invited your girlfriend.
Over for a bit of fun, to try something new
You know, only once or twice.
Twice, it was all the time!
The only way you could ever get turned on was with a whore!
- It's true, I find "ladies" so boring!
- Shut up!
- I don't want to listen this shit anymore, understood?
- That's what I love - passion, passion, come on!
- Andrés, just leave it, he's sick!
"That's not what she said the other day;"
she just kept begging me to keep fucking he.
R
- Asshole!
- Come on, man, kill me, kill me, come on, kill me!
Ok, what do you wanna know?
...Of course I knew her,
I've known her for ages, or do you think I'd send my best friend off with just anyone?
The problem was that, when she came the office that day, she asked for you at first, then asked for me... she wanted money, a lot of money...
- I thought we'd made a deal.
Sure... but there's a problem...
I don't want to stop seeing you... and you're still in love with me...
- In love with you?
...
I thought you understood
you're nothing but a client Carlos.
I was in love with you but you know, it was over when you started bringing other girls into it.
It's ok, it's ok...
I've got it... really got it...
I couldn't let her to do what she wanted.
...don't you understandAndrés?
...
I did all this for you, all of you...
I didn't do this for me,
You can see when this starts, but it has no end
This is a whore we're talking about.
I'm sure... when you calm down, and think about it you'll realize and then, you'll thank me.
- You killed the doorman, too You son of a bitch.
So what?
A bitch, a pimp... and a doorman
Let's go, honey, you know my parents don't like to eat late.
Come on, kids!
Who wants to visit Grandma and Grandpa, eh?
Come on, hurry up!
- My name's Gloria, for what it's worth ...and yours?
- Barros...
Andrés Barros...
- Don't worry... your buddies already paid for it...
Oh yeah, that's right... well, Gloria, I don't know what you charge, but you're worth double.
- Very nice, Andrés Barros...
- Thank you...
- Roberto?
Hey man!
They go and pay the whole deal, what's up with that?
Call me later, bye.
- Great night, wasn't it?

A lot... you take charge of the changes to the contract, ok?
... and how about last night?
- Oh!
Fine, fine...
and thanks for paying, it really wasn't necessary...
- It was our "fucking" gift, don't you remember?
- I know, I know...
- Or do you feel... a little guilty Mr. Barros?
- What are you talking about?
- That's what I'm talking about!
Two, fifteen...

What good life?
Work, and more work, what life is that?
Come on, don't be ungrateful, you're closer than ever to signing the contract of your life... by the way, when are you flying to BuenosAires?
The day after tomorrow, I think... but it won't be a real "trip".
I mean I'll land there, get the signatures and fly back the same evening.

Nice, of course...

That girl is amazing!
I'd like to thank you for your gift, it was a real nice gesture, but you shouldn't have gotten

Sorry, but you don't have to thank us for anything.
We only hope you enjoyed it.

Oh man, you shouldn't!

And, in the other hand, we have our marriage

How can I help you?
- I just need a lawyer
Look, right know we're completely booked, but I can give you the number of a friend.
I only need some advice if you understand... nobody has to know about this, if you don't want to
If you could answer some questions for me...
I can pay however you prefer ...Heh, what's up?
You didn't enjoy your time with me?
Why don't we go to my place?

I mean, I could have been with a client.
- ¿What happened to your face?
- Somebody wants to kill me.
- ¿Who is "somebody"?
His name is Carlos, he was a client, we had an affaire, you know... but please, you can't tell anybody about this, ok?
Look, we can take this to the court, we can put a restriction on the guy and I'll talk to my partner... no, no, no, please no!
I mean...
I just thought you could give me some advice, nothing else...
I'm sorry...
- It's ok... shh...

- I...
I really want you to go...
- Hey, wait, wait a second!
I don't understand!
- Go!
Please, go!

I don't really care about you, ok?
It doesn't matter to me so don't be calling me at home telling me about your problems

And me... the jewel of our family with my best friend, it sounds perfect

Rosario did, she felt sorry for her,
Carolina always looks so sad.

- Wait, wait, wait, stop, wait a second,
Sorry but I don't feel...
Listen to me...

This is just great - you were trying, so was

These things happen, don't exaggerate it!
Don't exaggerate!
I've been calling you all day, you disappear, I can't find you anywhere.
I was working.
Is that so strange?
-
Right, working.
Oh please
Look at me boy!
If I ever find out that you are cheating on me... you know what I mean, you have no idea what I'm capable of.
Rosario, please!
You know me, don't you?
I don't understand why you're bringing all of this up now
.
Don't you realize that I'm flying to BuenosAires early tomorrow morning?
- Why don't you leave right now!
- Remember that those are your own words

- ¡You killed her!
- How could I?
I just got here!
- You killed her, son of the bitch you killed her!
- Please listen to me, I did not!
- Yes you did!
You piece of shit you killed her!
I was just arriving when...
- You did it!
... ou did it!
Yes you did!
No, no, no, please,
I just arrived,
I have my passport here, please!
- Don't move!
What are you doing?
- My passport, it's my passport...
- Don't move, don't move!
Please don't shoot.
Can't you see?
I just arrived, just arrived,
I have nothing to do with her... she called me, I'm... you know,
I was a client, I'm a lawyer so she asked me for a little help because she had problems with a client of hers, mean, she didn't want to see him any more
And who you are?
For you I'm Ernesto,
and my version is the truth from this moment, you got me?
If I wanted to I could shot you right here...
like this or like this...
I can do that so cool, so smooth... eh?
Then I can put this in your hand and you "committed suicide",
and tomorrow the papers will look after the confusion
Nobody can get here and kill her for free, even if she's just a slut who you wanted to fuck,
you're up to your neck in this one fucker
If you aren't Carlos, you're gonna help me find him
Me
- I was never here
I don't exist here,.
Your prints are everywhere, all through this apartment.
You with me?
- Take her.
- Over there.
Turn off the water
come on...
What have you got there?
Change your t-shirt
put your hands on the table... take the cell phone no, no, leave your bag there...
close the door, close it.
- Over there... over there, come on...
- To the red car, over there, move it...
- What perfume to you use fucker?
- English lavender...
it's cologne
Cologne... you know she told me that... she told me that nobody kissed her like him...
Carlos... the bastard...
son of a bitch...
- I don't understand.
- Bitches never kiss, Mr. Lawyer... they only kiss the men they love...
Did she kiss you?
- No...
- What did she do for you?
Ok, you know what we're gonna do?
I'm not gonna take the stuf out of her apartment,
I'm not gonna clean it up,
I'm not gonna give your stuff back until you've helped me find Carlos.
Ok?
- Rosario!
What's wrong?
Do you need anything?
Ok.
We have three days, maybe four since she's under water, then she'll start to smell bad.
I don't know where to start!
You probably have a much better idea of where to find him.
- That's the deal.
I stand by my word.
Get out, get out!
- How can I get in touch with you?
- I have your documents, you're info,
I'll call you.
- I couldn't make anyone happy Roberto...
Why didn't I fall in love with you?
- Rosario, please.
...look, we'll clear this up,
I'll findAndrés and then call you, ok?
- Fuck him!
He can disappear for all I care!
- Don't say that.
- It's always you who ends up consoling me.
- That's what I'm here for.
- Okay, talk with him but, don't tell him about the videotape.
Ok, ok, but this could be a "misse an scene",
I've seen several similar cases.
Think about that.
Roberto, I'm not a little girl, ok?
I know what I'm talking about... you always warned me not to get involved with him because he'd make me suffer,
now look at me...
Take it easy, ok?
I'll find him and then call you.
Why don't you answer me?
Ernesto, man,
I've been calling for two days straight and.
I need the money, the fifteen million, you know
My son will visit you tomorrow, ok?
Give him the money fucker.
Hello...
Andrés...
Where have you been man?
Why did you take so long to get to BuenosAires?
...
What's the matter with you?
Where are you now?
Listen, Rosario knows about your affair with the hooker,
I covered your ass man, but if you don't call her soon you're fucked
Andres?
Hello?
- Hello?
So your fiancés name is Rosario?
Is it true that she's the owner... of that very famous art gallery?
What's it called?
- Where did you get that information?
I got it the same place that I found out you work for that successful law firm.
Now listen I need to meet you the day after tomorrow.
But, you gave me three days, it was a deal...
Change of plan,.
Things are gonna start getting ugly
Have you got anything on Carlos?
How can I, I don't even know who he is!
You could do that.
- But I don't exist here buddy, look,
I think it's very clear,
I'll shut my mouth, but you have to be a good boy, ok?
You better do as I say, first of all you find Carlos, then you get me some cash...
- Cash?
- That's right, cash.
Don't tell me you haven't got any?
Of course not, you've got my credit cards, my documents, everything.
I haven't got a thing!
Wait, wait, wait.
You think I'm gonna clean up that apartment for free?
I'm not talkin' about change for the bus,
I'm talkin' about fifteen million pesos.
- Fifteen millions...
in cash!
Are you kidding?
Where do you think I'm gonna get that kind of money?
How much do you think it's worth... to get your life back?
.
I'll call you and let you know where and when, otherwise I'll talk with your pretty bride
You son of the bitch!
If you put a hand on her...
I'll...
Hello... hello?
What are you doing here?
I called you but your cell phone was out.
What's with you?
- She was unconscious when I got there...
- So you heard them fucking, and you went in to take a look?
- Well... yes, I did... but...
- But what?
Is that how it was or not?
- Ok, you're right, that's what happened.
Do you realize?
... we have no defense...
You're fucked.
I don't know what the fuck you went in there for
- Well, you know...
I don't know, really...
I felt like she was threatening me, maybe I wanted to get my card back.
I mean to erase my self from there...
I really don't know man...
- What went on between you and that girl?
"
- Wait; wait... if you think I killed her"
why don't you call the police now ok?
- Good morning.
I'd like to file a report.
Stop!
...
What's the matter with you, man?
Why are you doing this?
I'm putting myself in the place of the judge
This is what will happen to you if you don't do exactly what I say.
- Ok, ok, whatever you say.
- Did you get a look at that guy?
Carlos?
No, I didn't.
Well, you know I think it was him who left through the emergency door when I got there but, I didn't actually see him.
So we have no information on him.
That's probably just a name he gave to the hooker.
I think Ernesto is Carlos... well, maybe not, maybe he gave me that name to throw me off.
I think he's trying to gain time,
I think he's planning to leave the country
Shit, I don't know,
I've been thinking a lot since yesterday evening.
Look, it doesn't matter if we don't find that Carlos guy, ok?
Ernesto wants money, and we need your bag and all stufs back from that apartment.
- I don't care about the money,.
But Rosario... that's what I'm worried about
How did she get dragged into this?
Well, somebody sent her a security video with you and the girl in the elevator
Shit!
What's this, man?
...
Wait, wait, and wait if you appear on that videotape then there are probably some more
Images of the day she was murdered.
- That doorman is a strange guy.
He should have copies of the videotapes.
Then we've got to get the tapes from him now
Tell me where to find him, and I'm gone.
You stay here and try to relax.
Don't go anywhere.
Here in Santiago.
I'll figure out what to say to the doorman.
Your best defense is that no one knows you're Not even Rosario.
- How is she?
- Bad, but for now it's better that she stays out of this.
Anything you get on them, call me, ok?
Ernesto and Gloria, there must be some information.
- I just got your copies...
Juan...
- please follow me.
- Ok.
ROBERTO WE HAVE TO TALK, HERE, TOMORROW EVENING.
YOU BETTER SEE THIS, I HAVE COPIES
Rosario... it's Roberto...
I foundAndrés, he's in BuenosAires, his flight was late...
Listen Rosario, everything will be ok, don't worry... please call me, I need to talk to you
Andrés?
... hello man!
You just up and left the other day
What's up?
You don't like my car, or something?
Listen, we're friends, aren't we?
Tell me, did you get BuenosAires, or not?
- No, not yet...
- Shit, man!
I figured you were there dancing tango, having a drink, a steak, fucking girls.
Is it true that those assholes mix water in with their wine?
Haven't you left yet?
- Too much workman, too much work.
Hey honey!
The other side, please!
...
Do I have to explain everything?
No, no, no man, you're so wrong, how many times have I told you?
Life is for living fucking girls, drinking,
By the way, how's married life?
What's new with Rosario?
She's fine, really, we're not gonna go to see how hard they fucked your beautiful "friend" again
What a crazy girl, man!
...
They
Listen man, I gotta go now, ok?
Really messed her up bad ... and then she sucked harder and swallowed!
She likes the "venom"!
Well, listen brother, I've gotta go, phone cards aren't free you know, and I'm in the middle of an important deal.
If you need anything just give me a call...
later
- Something to drink?
- No, no, no, talk to me.
I talked with a friend at Court, she told me about a prostitute named Gloria.
She was arrested a long time ago with her friend Ernesto Bahamondes, a hotel manager.
- That's them
- Of course it is!
- Where did you get this?
Well, I talked with that doorman, he lied and lied, he said that he has nothing to do with that videotapes...
When I got to my office, I found this tape
- Did you see it?
- Yes...
I saw everything...
Rosario's in it.
- What?
- Images don't lie.
- What are you talking about?
I really don't know but I think... she watched that videotape where you appear with that girl, ok?
She got furious, she went to talk to her, they had a wrangle or something... you know... it could be an accident.
But... how is it possible...
Rosario... who the hell sent you this tape?
...
Ernesto, he's fucking with us... shit!
What the fuck are we gonna do now?
We have to get the tapes from Ernesto.
If Rosario is guilty?
We have to protect her.
We both know she's no murderer, this was an accident.
- We have to get that apartment, right now
We have to get rid of the prints
Ernesto killed that girl, I have no doubt about it, now
- Listen Roberto, you don't have to get mixed up in this.
- Tell those bastards that I'm not in Santiago.
- Hi
- Hi, where's your boss?
- I really don't know, he's out from the city, I think.
- Hi, It's Rosario, please leave me a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible, thanks.
- Hello Rosario, you don't know me... my name is Ernesto, I'm a friend of Andrés
I needto talk to you.
I need to meet you, actually
- Hello?
- Ernesto, I finally get to meet you, man!
- Hello Mr. Ernesto, we were looking for you ...here, here!
- I just talked with your father boy...
I'll get the money tomorrow.
- You're a fucking idiot Ernesto, why in the hell did you take on a debt like that?
Look, if it were up to me I wouldn't give you one more day ...Let's see guys... in any case I don't think you'll get fifteen million together by tomorrow.
What do the rest of you think?
- Of course not, where from?
Give me your hand...
your hand, man!
...
Look ...fifteen millions peso tomorrow... my friend.
- Calm down man, you'll talk with her...
Where's your date with Ernesto tomorrow?
- On the street, in front of our ofice...
No way man, we've got to get him upstairs... and he has to bring us the videotapes... at about half past six, there's usually nobody around at that time,
Shit!
...
I don't know the number
I bet it's him...
should I answer?
...Hello?
Yes!
Yes, yes... yes, of course I've got your money... and Carlos, too ...yes, sure, but there will be a little change,
Listen, you'll have to come up to my office, ok?
No, later, at a half past six, eleventh floor,
No, later, at a half past six, eleventh floor, bring the videotapes with you, don't forget... well, the one you sent to Rosario and the other one
What?
Oh, no, no, no!
Ok!
Ok!
Whatever you say!
I've got it!
Sure I have but, please listen to me, I!
...
Hello?
...
He'll be in the street at five o'clock, he says he has no idea about the videotapes...
- What about Carlos?
- He wants the money at first, then he wants Carlos.
- Sure, you give him the money and then he kills you 'cause you don't have any Carlos...
No, this is the plan, first he give me my documents back and then we give him the money, then we can tell him a story about Carlos... now we've got to clean that apartment...
- ¡Oh shit, Andrés!
- Shit!
- He's absolutely crazy, man!
- I'm going to bed.
I'm exhausted.
- I'll wait till it turns of.
- Your bill.
I don't know, I'll call back... well Andres you'll have to meet him, on the street what else can we do?
We won't get anywhere on the street... you'll have to go down and convince him to come up...
Look, he drives a sport red car, 80's style, you know, very ordinary.
...He's easy to recognize, he's bald tell him you're my lawye and a good friend of mine, and that you helped me find Carlos then tell him that we have the money but,
first, he has to give us the keys to the apartment and the videotapes too, of course
you have to convince him.
Hey Mr. Lawyer, what's up?
.
What's up, you bastard?
Who's this idiot you sent?
Am I speaking Chinese, or do you not understand what I said?
I'm not going up to your fucking ofice okay?
And I haven't got any fucking videotapes
- Mr. Roberto, I'm off.
- Whatever you want...
- Son of a bitch!
He's gone crazy, man!
He just called me and denied everything!
- I know, he got away!
Find him you fucker!
- Fuck!
He won't answer!
- Shit... shit!
- Hey, wait!
What's wrong?
Have you gone mad?
We need to change our plan, Andrés.
We can't let this guy tell us... how things are done.
Wait, wait...
I won't...
I mean, I'm not gonna...
Don't count me in on this don't you remember you're a lawyer?
What if someone else is involved, if someone else is giving us the run around?
But... think, man, he's the only one who appears on the videotape...
Ernesto is doing this to save his own ass.
- Hi!
...
Yeah, it's me...
Why didn't you show up last night?
Right now?
No, no, wait!
...
Ok.
- I don't know how you think it's gonna helpAndres by giving me these videos.
- That's what I wanted to talk to you about last night.
- But you didn't show up.
- I ran into some problems, that's all... and... what are on those tapes anyway?
- You know as well as I do you're the one who sent them.
- I didn't send you anything...
What's on the tapes?
- They show Andres and the dead woman in the elevator...
- Gloria was her name, ok?
And what else?
Oh, give me a break, I'm not gonna give you all the details.
You know what?
If we got hold of the other tapes from that day we could find out who killed Gloria
Sorry but, did you fuck on a sport red car anytime?
Do you know what we're gonna do?
You're going to drive us straight to... the office of your boyfriend,
Ok?
But first we're gonna make a little phone call.
- Hello?
...
Rosario?
- Andrés!
...
Andrés, please, do what he says, I can't take this!
- Hello, Mr. Lawyer?
You listen to me son of a bitch!
If anything happens to her I'll kill you.
You hear me!
Yes, I have all your fucking money...
He has Rosario, they're coming here...
- Shit!
...
- Ok, ok, yes, first floor.
I'll go down to meet them.
- Be careful.
- Sure.
- Ok!
Calm down, please!
This isn't necessary!
Ok?
- Stop, stop, stop, stop!
Over there, come on!
Carlos will be here any minute!
You arrived before him, he has no you even exist.
- I don't give a shit about Carlos, I'm in a hurry.
Carlos isn't what interests me,
I want the money and all of the videotapes you have.
- But...
I don't have the videos, you've got them haven't you?
- Who is Carlos?
- Shut up, bitch!
Wait, wait, wait a second!
"Somebody's sending those videotapes;
I really thought it was you... "
Ernesto, look, let's finish this right now, give me my documents, and I'll give you your money.
That's it, ok?
I really like your speech Mr. Lawyer but, I don't think you understand... give me my money, then I give you your documents and your "wife" comes with me, as a "plus", then
I disappear.
- She wasn't part of our deal, man!
- We have a "new deal" now!
Come on, stand up, stand up you bitch!
The money, give me the money!
Ok, ok, ok, sure...
here it is... all the money, please let her go
Ernesto, please, listen to me, let her go!
Please!
- I'll take your girl, boy!
Maybe she'll learn a few things with me!
- Let me go!
- Hey!
- Ok, ok, you calm down, calm down... it's all over...
- We're really fucked now.
- What did you want me to do?
- Are you crazy?
He wasn't going to shoot me!
And what about Rosario?
Were you going to let him just take her?
He was just a fucking pimp anyway
- What are you doing here?
- You read my note, didn't you?
... ...I sent the tapes to them, to show them what kind of person are you Roberto.
- What will you do now?
- What's on that tape?
- That you also visited that apartment.
Stop, I didn't kill anybody!
...
I...
I only wanted to confront her... face to face but... it was too late when I arrived.
- But that's not all.
- Give me the tape.
It's over, this has already caused enough problems.
- What are you doing, man?
- Stop!
Stop it!
Give me that!
You know?
It wasn't a surprise to me, at all,
I expected just about anything from him.
You have no idea who he really isAndrés.
- ¡Roberto, Roberto!
Stop there, this is not a game!
What are you gonna do now?
.
You wanna kill me or something?
You wanna fuck your life up because of me?
...
Ernesto is our scapegoat, or don't you remember?
- No...
You're going to have to explain a few things.
- I don't think it's to your advantage.
- Call the police.
What about me?
...I sent that videotapes.
Nothing will happen to you, I'm not going to denounce you?
So, are you going to call or shall I?
- Oh, please, don't kill meAndrés!
Please...
- I'm not like you.
I won't shoot.
Even though you don't know it you're right.
Isn't that true Rosario sweetie?
Tell your fiancé.
Tell him how hard we fucked.
- Roberto, stop
- What are you talking about you son of a bitch?
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, my mother was not a bitch, but your bride certainly is!
The bitches were the ones you fucked while you made me watch!
...
You did the same with Carolina, didn't you?
I can't take it any more.
I knew Gloria.
- What kind of shit is this Rosario?
- A couple of times I invited your girlfriend.
Over for a bit of fun, to try something new
You know, only once or twice.
Twice, it was all the time!
The only way you could ever get turned on was with a whore!
- It's true, I find "ladies" so boring!
- Shut up!
- I don't want to listen this shit anymore, understood?
- That's what I love - passion, passion, come on!
- Andrés, just leave it, he's sick!
"That's not what she said the other day;"
she just kept begging me to keep fucking he.
R
- Asshole!
- Come on, man, kill me, kill me, come on, kill me!
Ok, what do you wanna know?
...Of course I knew her,
I've known her for ages, or do you think I'd send my best friend off with just anyone?
The problem was that, when she came the office that day, she asked for you at first, then asked for me... she wanted money, a lot of money...
- I thought we'd made a deal.
Sure... but there's a problem...
I don't want to stop seeing you... and you're still in love with me...
- In love with you?
...
I thought you understood
you're nothing but a client Carlos.
I was in love with you but you know, it was over when you started bringing other girls into it.
It's ok, it's ok...
I've got it... really got it...
I couldn't let her to do what she wanted.
...don't you understandAndrés?
...
I did all this for you, all of you...
I didn't do this for me,
You can see when this starts, but it has no end
This is a whore we're talking about.
I'm sure... when you calm down, and think about it you'll realize and then, you'll thank me.
- You killed the doorman, too You son of a bitch.
So what?
A bitch, a pimp... and a doorman
Let's go, honey, you know my parents don't like to eat late.
Come on, kids!
Who wants to visit Grandma and Grandpa, eh?
Come on, hurry up!
Come here
Come here...
Quiet, please
Truth or dare.
Who do you adore?
Heman, you start
Can I name somebody casually?
Bullshit!
Truth or dare.
How can you tell us in a casual manner?
Sophie!
It isn't funny.
You always say you adore me.
I mean it
James
Me?
Sophie
Your turn, Charles
Surely Sophie
What a coincidence?
I adore Sophie too
How about you, Sophie?
Who do you adore?
Truth or dare.
Tell us.
No need to panic
Tell us, Sophie
Yeah, tell us
Tell us.
We've already told you
Tell us.
Truth or dare
C'mon
Ken?
!
She's said she adores you, Scholar... how about you?
Truth or dare
Tell us who you adore
I adore.........
Sophie
This is an amusing game?
Let's tell play "Who should die?"
I start.
I want you to die!
Lily, let's play another game
It must be you who don't want to play this game!
Who?
Lily, It's me.
Open the door
Go see Sophie.
Why do you still call me?
Open the door first
Just say what you want
I've just lied.
I love you
I can't see......... why you lied to so many people but only tell me the truth
I can't figure out why cos there were so many people
If I'd said I love you, it'd make Sophie embarrassed
You only care about Sophie.
How about me?
T rust me...
Have you thought of my feelings?
What's the matter?
Let's play snooker, Ken
The ferry arrives.
You may go now if all of you are ready
Ken's still up stairs
I go tell him
After we played the snooker last night
Charles, James and Clark played poker in my room.
Clark even lost a bet of two hundred dollars
You may ask them
Last night...
I found him he looked unfortunate
I wanted to remind him but forgot to do so...
Now he's disappeared
We didn't have any grievances
Charles used to be his best friend
I really don't know what happened with him
They knew each other since they were children
I don't think they would kill him
Just make an assumption
What happened last night, ma'am?
I have no idea
Please do me a favor.
Don't move any items in this room.
This allows us to gather more information and evidence
Sir...
You want to know if the victim had died, right?
It's a FAQ
Once we haven't found the corpse this is only a case of a lost person
From our point of view... all the people at the scene are suspects
As a rational detective
I can't eliminate all other possibilities
As a logic detective...
I think there must be flaws for the most perfect crime
But be realistic truth sometimes remains silent
Technically I've already answered all of your questions
It's great to see you again, Sophie.
Never go again
Yeah, uncle
Sorry that I was so wild
You've gone overseas for a year
I worried about you
Ye know, I have no kids
I see you as my real daughter
What do you want to do this time?
I have no idea at the moment
I've made plans for you
Run the biz after you take a rest
The biz is the fruit of dad and you, uncle
I'm at the age of retirement
I've been your guardian and deputy director over ten years
I should take a break
But I don't know how to run a biz
And it's you who handle the biz after dad's passed away
You can handle it
Take it easy
We're going to the law firm
Then you are the successor of all your dad's property
And I can forget about succession issue
Files of Young Kindaichi (detective story) again.
Always read this book
Don't you know this is "re-reading"?
I know!
But you've known the ending, anything interesting then?
Mind your business.
Read your book on your own
Be careful.
The devils dwell in you
The devils dwell in you!
I've learn't a new magic...
I show you
Here's a piece of paper
Now it's two pieces
Good!
Great!
Again.
What's that?
Four pieces of paper
Fold it
Then fold it again
After you blow it once the four pieces become a piece again
Ask a lady to do so.
Right
Quick...
Amazing
You're wasting my time
I've bought a digital cam.
Take some pics of you
Fine!
I take the pics first...
A pic of group...
My turn...
A pic of group!
Can you hear her?
Let's go to that side
You're troublesome
Ready... 1... 2... 3
Hi friends, I'm back
I miss you all
Let's get together
I would like to invite you for dinner at seven on 30th October
Looking forward to seeing you
We haven't seen for a year
Is Sophie the same as before?
I think so
Your face's still as nasty as before
Sure!
You're the same as before
You two are still ironical
Two"David Letterman"
You think it's funny?
Very funny!
Funny?
Nonsense
Look at you
You two can't win Sophie
You should know that
Don't waste your time
She's been to America for a year
Got it?
It's said that Sophie succeed his dad
She's pretty and rich...
How can you three win her?
Actually she's the most ironical gal
Long time no see.
How're you?
Sophie...
Lily!
Sophie!
Haven't seen you for a long time.
You're slimmer
Only you appreciate me
Clark!
Sophie!
Sophie's talked to me
What're you doing?
I'm studying Tantric Buddhism.
Tantric Buddhism?
This is the amulet sent by the master
He said it can protect me against all the devils
Can I touch it?
It doesn't make sense
Look at me!
Don't fight!
It's powerful, right?
That's enough!
Where's Heman?
Has he arrived?
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Take a look
Go take a look
You fool us again!
It's for you
Thanks
Heman don't do this next time.
It's scaring.
Just a surprise for you
Surprise?
You're too much!
Right.
Have you thought of our feeling?
Just ignore this bloke
We haven't seen each other for a long time, Sophie.
Let's go out together
Nope!
Sophie's fagged.
Let her take a rest
I don't go back to America.
We got plenty of time
Call you tomorrow
What do you want?
Your belongings dropped
Watch out, nanny!
Excuse me...
Are you alright?
It's alright...
Sorry
Hello?
Have you received the invitation, Clark?
Yeah!
I'm on the way back to the restaurant
OK...
I'm coming
What's wrong?
Out of service again?
Back to the restaurant
Hello?
Lily, I've received the invitation.
How about you?
Yeah, I also received it.
I'm coming
Hurry up
Sorry that I went a year ago
If you wanna get together do go to Sophie's villa on 31 Oct. Cheerio, Ken.
I don't think this is Ken's invitation
The most strange thing is the invitations reaching us suddenly
Don't you think this is very strange?
Strange?
What's strange?
It's all your tricks!
Be fair to me, please
I got to see Ken
Then let's go to the villa together
I go with you, Sophie
I go too
Ken's lost for a long time.
I think he's already...
What?
I think this is an weird invitation
If so, why was it printed?
How much do you know about the mysterious world?
Ken hasn'tdied!
Don't say he's dead
I've read a book.........
It says that if people decline the weird invitation the devils will pull their souls out
At that time...they'll die
What do you mean?
We got to go to the gathering!
Don't get into a scrap
Let's go together
We go tomorrow morning
Watch out
Watch out
Take care
When should I pick you up?
Five days later
If we change the schedule, I'll call you by the GMS phone
OK
OK
Coming...
Uncle Liu!
I'm coming...
Just one minute
Ma'am!
How're you, Uncle Liu?
Every thing's just the same as last year
Just the trees grow taller
Nothing changed.
You may see that
I'm sure that no one's come for a year
You think you're Sherlock Holms
Wait a minute...
Do you think this villa's...strange?
Strange?
Then you stay away the villa
Ma'am, you...
We'll stay here for a few days
Uncle Liu, has Ken come?
Ken?
Actually I got something tell you, ma'am
But...
Since Ken's lost... there were so many mysterious things
Frankly speaking, there're haunted ghosts.
What haunted ghosts?
It's the same as before.
Nothing strange
No, since Ken's lost... there're so many unexplained things happened
When I cleaned up one day...
I found a hand print.
Here's the hand print
I couldn't brush it off no matter what I used
I tried to paint it
But it appeared the next day
It made my hair stand on end
Then I...
lock this room
Bullshit.
It shouldn't be a mysterious print?
Make way
Don't touch it.
It's a mysterious sign
What's wrong?
Sorry...it's really a mysterious sign
From the metaphysics point of view, if one is murdered his spirit will stay in the scene of crime...
Ken hasn't died!
He's died.
Nope,it shouldn't be the case!
Weird invitations followed by a black hand print... you still think he's alive?
He's a ghost
Shut up
Ken's still alive!
Crazy!
Lily!
She's fine.
Don't worry.
What's wrong?
I've just told you the fact
You fake psychic always tell horrible stories to scare us
What?
You don't believe me.
You're audacious...
Then you sleep in this room tonight
So what?
What if all of you sleep in this room alone for a night?
I dare not?
I got an amulet.
I don't fear spirits
Don't be childish
What?
How about you, adult?
You dare sleep here alone?
!
Then I start.
Why do you start?
Calm down!
Quiet, please
Now draw a lot to see who starts.
From long to short...
Starts with the bloke drawing the longest pencil
Don't play this game!
Right.
It's very mystifying.
Don't play this game.
Get out.
I wanna see how mystifying is.
Just pencils
You start; then I follow you
I'm the third and you follow me
Heman, we used to be schoolmates
Though I dislike you, take this amulet
No matter what you think it's just for safety
It's you who make them separate forever
He's frightened.
Don't make him draw the lot.
Your heartbeat's very fast
You wrong me!
Stop it!
I haven't finished the game.
I answer the question now.
I want you die!
Who?
Why do you blow your lips?
I'm wrong?
They all want Ken die!
Crazy!
Forget it.
You should know they're loud-mouth
We haven't seen each other for a long time...
Forget about it
You think we're good friends
But you haven't sent me a letter after you went to America
You complain me?
I've sent you so many e-mail messages but got no reply
You have?
Sure
How about you and other schoolmates?
Well, I've been an insurance agent
Clark's great.
He nearly traveled around the world
Sometimes he went to China to learn Chinese astrology
Sometimes he went to Thailand to learn Thai magic spell
And tarot and the black magic of Miao tribe...
And also Malay black magic
He did?
He's more and more superstitious
James's more amusing
He learnt Muay Thai...
He's learnt how to perform the Buddhist rituals for a year
Very funny
How about Heman and Charles?
Beats me.
I didn't see them since last year.
I've just met them again
Let's play billiard
Fine.
No, I don't play it.
What's the matter?
You have a poor impression on billiard.
What do you mean?
I mean billiard!
Go!
Get out...
Get out!
Hide yourself?
You still hide yourself.
I've taken off your shoe.
I kill you!
Get out...
Get out!
No...please!
You're screaming?
I've seen you held Lily tightly in the Bio Lab
But you said you adore Sophie.
Who do you adore?
He must be a gigolo!
He aims at Sophie's money
All of you're jealous 'cos Sophie adores me!
Still talk back!
What happened after that?
Later...we four played poker
Did you lose your memory?
After playing poker, what happened?
Who?
Why don't you tell them about our affairs?
It isn't necessary
But we don't need to make our dating like tryst
I don't think so
But they're our best friends
It's them who don't know our love but we don't hide it
What're you doing here?
What're you doing here?
I'm waiting for Ken
Forget about him.
He never comes back.
What're you talking about?
Do you remember last year's bloody scene?
Now there's a black hand print
He'd died
Forget about him
You still say this?
You said Ken's died when we've come
What do you want?
You want him died?
No, I don't want anybody die here again
Please convince ma'am to leave here and go to other places for vacation
Once Ken comes
I ask him to call you
It's Ken who told us to come here
I just worry... something unfortunate will happen
Uncle Liu
You're only a housekeeper and mind your own business
Don't get into other people's business
Yeah...
But...
Your're ma'am's friend
Please go back to the room for a rest
Once the ferry comes, I call you, OK?
Thanks
Uncle, it's Sophie
We're in the villa
It's alright...
Don't worry...
OK.
Bye
There's a ferry!
It's Ken!
Ferry?
Where's it?
I've just seen the ferry moving towards us
Where's Ken?
Perhaps you've seen...
the ferry of ghosts?
Don't scare Sophie!
It's OK.
Don't panic.
I'm fine
Why do you serve the dishes?
Ken hasn't come.
I thought you picked up Ken, so I served the dishes first.
What's the matter?
Ken's come here.
No need to worry about him.
It's weird invitation.
I got the point.
Now all become notes for mysterious world
How about your invitations?
It's very strange, ma'am.
You'd better go
It's your trick again!
Nobody likes your disgusting magic, Heman Copperfield.
Don't say it's my tricks all the time
Charles was here.
He's the witness
Or...
let's go
Charles it's you who told us to come
What do you think?
I can't imagine... it's so scaring
Sophie if you stay here, I'll go with you
Me too!
Me too!
I stay here if you do, Sophie
I got to wait for Ken
Then we stay here for extra two days
Cockroach!
No... stay away...
Who?
Who?
Who?
Ken?
Ken
Ken
Ken
Ken
Ken
I've seen Ken
Where's he?
I couldn't catch him 'cos he ran very fast
Where did he go?
I have no ideas!
That dream sounds pretty real
How can you mix the dream and reality together?
Heman... he lost!
Haunted ghost!
It comes again
What ghosts?
Haunted ghost!
It's Heman's trick!
T rust me.
There're ghosts;
otherwise, there isn't one more hand print.
Where're two... it's haunted ghost!
Don't panic!
Where's the ghost?
Has it talked to you?
Let's look for Heman
And also look for Ken.
He's come.
You've seen him?
I know he must be in this villa
You two... go to hell
A fake psychic and a crazy woman.
A pair of crazy couples!
What're you talking about?
Don't get into a scrap!
Let's look for Heman first.
No, don't look for him
It must be him who play tricks on us
He'll be back after he gets tired of his tricks
Yeah.
If we look for him... he won't come back...
We aren't fools...
It's great to play mahjong
Don't play paper, scissor, stone alone like Heman.
Forget about him
Something I need to tell you
I was the champion of Guangdong Mahjong Junior Open
And you were selected for the primary school team
Bullshit
Roll the dice
Hurry up!
Why?
What are you doing?
14 starts from here.
It's 14
Eight circles
Excuse me.
Pung
Pung again
Hurry up, man.
Next time
Wait a minute
Unbelievable
Pung again!
Jesus.
That's enough.
I win if you discard circle tiles again.
Ninebamboose
You win with this tile?
Wait.
Pung...
Excuseme
Three circles.
Bingo!
Sorry, Sophie
Shit!
I hold a consistency hand but fail to show
It wasn't me who didn't discard the tiles
Even I discarded them, you couldn't win.
God bless me.
Kong
Eight circles shown
You hold four "coffins".
Be careful.
I will, thanks
Don't discard the "sun" if you got it
Sun rises in the West is terrible
You're in bad luck but don't get us into the troubles
Let him make the decision on his own
One circle!
Thirteenorphansshown!
I've told you that don't discard the "sun"
Take it easy.
Just a game.
I don't play after finishing this round
Fine
You get fewer tiles?
Yeah, I got twelve only
Game over.
Let's go.
Go?
I'm gonna win
Go
Are you crazy?
Let's go
Have you thought that Heman may die?
No, it must be him who plays tricks on us
Heman likes to playt ricks
But he's go missing
Was he caught by the ghosts?
Don't be so superstitious,Clark
It's difficult to explain something weird.
Perhaps it's you next time.
Lily.
Do you worry about Heman?
He may have accident.
No!
I don't care about him
I miss Ken only
Last year Ken slept in room no.7 and disappeared puzzlingly
This year there're weird invitations, black hand print. and notes for mysterious world.
Hemansleptinroomno.7andalsolost
Don't you think it's mystifying?
You have to make it clear
Heman's case and Ken's case are two different stories
You always mix them together and scare us
Perhaps it's Ken who plays tricks on us
I tell you...
Ken's dead
After he went missing, I invited him to our world...
He told me he's murdered
Sophie
Tell you a secret
Ken's been my boyfriend for a long time
But we didn't tell you
What're you talking about?
He said he adored you in the game "Truth or Dare"...
In fact he lied to you
No, he didn't!
Well, if you don't believe me...
I'll see Ken tonight and ask him to tell you this
Has he told you who's the murderer?
Nope
Then don't bullshit!
It's hot
I can't stand hotness...
I go...
What's wrong with the door?
Anybody outside?
Open the door!
The door's locked!
Let me see
I give it a try!
It's getting hotter and hotter
Yeah, it's very hot
Go now!
Don't stay here
Hit the door!
Anybody outside?
Hit the door!
Hit the door!
Anybody outside?
Open the door!
Hit!
Are you OK?
It's us who did the dinner...
How's it?
It's Sophie who made the dishes alone.
I didn't involve in it.
Who hoaxed?
We were nearly cooked
I just talked with Lily outside the villa
We don't know what happened in the villa
I've told you that this is a haunted villa but you don't believe me!
Or...
let's go
Call the captain to come here, Sophie
Hurry up...
And look for Uncle Liu
I haven't seen him for a whole day
And Heman...
look for him too
I've told you that he'll appear later
Right!
We haven't seen Uncle Liu for a whole day
Would it be him who hoaxed us?
Uncle Liu's lost and so has my GMS phone!
What should we do?
We can't leave here.
We're dying this time...
Calm down!
It's horrible!
I got some clues for what happened in these two days
It should relate to the room no...7
It's you who sleep in room no.7 tonight!
Lily
I think.........it seems that Ken adores me.........
What?
I think he.........adores me
You th in k?
It's better to ask him about this
Why don't you go?
I wanna ask you a question
What's that?
Do you...
like me?
What's wrong?
I haven't said anything.
Let's go.
What's your relationship with Sophie?
We're schoolmates
We're schoolmates too
What do you mean?
It seems that she adores you
But I don't
Let's go see a film
Ken
It's no use to get those innocent involved...
Stay away from us.
It isn't our fault...
It's no use to get those innocent involved...
Stay away from us.
It isn't our fault...
It's no use to get those innocent involved...
Stay away from us...
Keep quiet!
It's annoying!
It's horrible!
I recite the scripture to pray God to bless all of us
Should I thank you?
Let's think what Charles's thinking
It's no use to get those innocent involved!
Heman...
Uncle Liu...
It must be Heman or Uncle Liu!
What's the link with Uncle Liu?
Uncle Liu's been the housekeeper
This villa belongs to my Uncle
It must be your uncle who aims at your property
I don't think so...
It's about the ghosts.........
You'd better shut your mouth up!
You're so clever...
Do you know how Ken died?
You don't believe that Ken's die, right?
It's him who told me about this!
And I saw he was pushed off the cliff!
Drizzles fall on the greenery
A tile drops on the petals
I've said it isn't about the ghost!
You think this is a poem by ghost?
Who writes it?
It must be Heman...
He's a hoaxer...
He likes hoax, right?
I play with him
I don't think I can't find him
Tile?
Aren't these tiles?
Where's the glass?
It's thirteen orphan.
Why are there three one circle?
In the hand of 05?
05?
Charles's room!
In the hand of 05.........
What's that?
In the hand of 05.........
What's that?
You...don't close the door...
In the hand.........hand!
What hand?
Are you OK, Charles?
It's a battery!
Run...
This time...we can't escape our destiny
I've told you that we can't escape our destiny
Can't imagine Charles's died!
Is it Charles who killed Ken.........
So Ken's spirit comes back...
to take revenge...
We're dying...
Don't always talk about 'dying', OK?
You don't believe me?
Now there's a guy died.
If not ghost, the most suspicious one is...
Sophie!
Me?
This is your villa!
Who can do this except you?
For what purpose?
Like me, you want to take revenge on Ken's death!
No No!
Ken's hatred justifies murder?
Then kill me!
Stop it!
How come you trust her?
She's crazy!
She only pestered Ken!
You can knock me but don't knock Ken!
It's your turn to sleep in room no.7
Will I do what you said, idiot?
Fine...
I wait for Ken in room no...7
Lily we'd better stay away from room no.7
If you stop me, I'll kill you!
So do you two!
It's no use to get those innocent involved...
Stay away from us.
It isn't our fault.
It's no use to get those innocent involved...
Stay away from us.
It isn't our fault.
It's no use to get those innocent involved...
May you rest in peace
We're fine.
No need to come back.
I.........
Why did you scream?
I.........
You scare us again?
Who scare you?
I just hold a memorial service for Charles
Charles died in the villa
For whom do you hold the memorial service?
Me?
It isn't Charles.
I just passed through...
I saw...
Heman lying in the pasture
He's also dead!
What's wrong?
It's you...
What?
It's you who killed Heman!
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about!
It's horrible!
I go now!
Where're you?
Help!
Who can help you?
Anybody hear me?
Help!
I got to go!
Hello!
Anybody hear me?
You're annoying!
Annoying?
We're dying!
Here's no ferry.
If you wanna go you can swim
You think I won't do so?
You will, right?
Help...
I can't swim.........
I can't swim.........
I can't swim.
Help!
Clark!
Clark!
What's the matter?
How come you ask me?
Perhaps it's hot.
Help...
Save him.
Hurry up.
Me?
I can't swim
I can't neither
I can't swim.
Help...
Why have you pushed me off the sea?
It's you who wanted to go.
I just gave you a helping hand.
It's you who want me die.
You know I can't swim.
How can I know that?
You said you were scared
How can I know if you don't tell me?
And you...you didn't try to save him
You two want me die!
I don't know swimming, how can I save you?
Both of you don't know swimming...
I don't know neither.
What a coincidence?
It's lucky that Sophie saved me
Forget about it, Clark.
They have their own difficulties.
That's it
If I really wanted you die, how could you be still alive?
Yeah.
I haven't died...but Heman's died
Heman's died?
His body is there!
It's about here
I think it should be here.
It's very close to the scene.
Where's it?
Please go down have a look
Can you find it?
Is there... no
Search through carefully.
It's very close to the scene.
See if there is any remain left
Search through.
Any human body there?
I've searched through but there isn't any body left
What tricks do you play?
Impossible.
Heman's body was there
I know...it's you who moved the body away
You're the murderer, so you wrecked the body to eliminate the evidence.
You wrong me?
Remember... you've said you want Heman die
So you pushed me off the sea
You wanted to kill me too!
James...
Shouldn't be you?
If I killed Heman, he must be the co-worker...
We were together
T rust me, Sophie
Only four of us are alive.
Who's trustful?
Everybody except her!
She said she'd kill us last night
Yeah
If you stopped me from seeing Ken, I'd kill you!
But I won't kill the innocent
Perhaps you have psychiatric disorder and even didn't realize you'd killed people?
Right.
It's difficult to say
How difficult?
You always scare us.
It's most likely that you're the murderer!
And you too.
You always pretend timid
What do you want?
You want us to pity you?
In fact, the murderer's you
You fear people suspect you're the murderer, right?
That means the one seems to be innocent is the murderer, right?
That means Sophie's the murderer?
I've said Sophie's the murderer
No!
Forget about her, Sophie
It must be your uncle who sent Uncle Liu to kill us.
Then he can get all of your property
You aren't a detective
Why did he kill Charles and Heman?
If he killed Sophie only, it's obvious that he aims at the money, right?
If he killed the other two, it'll make the police confused, idiot.
Why did uncle kill Ken a year ago?
Perhaps it was you who killed Ken
He comes back for revenge
It's sensible
If not Ken, it must be you!
Or you, or...
Or you!
You didn't kill people?
No, I didn't!
Is it more likely that I'm the murderer?
You two...
Either you or she.
If not you, it must be her!
It isn't me!
A crazy woman and a foolish psychic
I've told you that I haven't killed anybody!
You haven't?
Is it you?
Nonsense!
Stay here!
Lily!
I trust you
Don't sleep in room no.7tonight
What?
You want sleep in that room?
No.
I fear you may be killed
Or you fear I'll see Ken?
I can't see why everybody adores you
We were classmates from kindergarten to secondary school.
And so were we in college
I got better results than you
And I looked at the mirror before bedtime
I don't think I'm worse than you
Who?
Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
I don't fear you!
Don't...
Lily...
Ken?
Ken
Ken.
Help!
What're you doing?
What're you doing?
It's horrible...
Only you believe there're ghosts.
Nobody can help me except you.
I want to take a leak.
Can you go with me?
Just a moment.
Follow me
This way!
Don't be so fast.Nature calls...
Get in!
Here's the toilet?
One more hand print.!
Hand print!
Open the door Sophie.
Help...
Open the door!
Who?
It's Clark.........
What's the matter?
I've seen Uncle Liu's in the secret chamber...
He's bloody...and bottles of wine...
Open the door!
Room no. 7...there is a secret passage to a secret chamber
We've seen there're bottles of wine...
Uncle Liu's head's lost.
And there's a lot of blood...
Uncle Liu's died!
What're you doing?
Give it back to me.
The picture's mine!
Ken's mine!
Where's James?
None of my business
Where's he?
How can I know?
Why does James's room become no.7?
Why is there so much blood?
James!
Where's he?
James...
Clark!
Clark...
Are you OK?
It's OK.........
Go!
Clark!
Clark...
Clark...
My knife...where's it?
Clark!
Clark...
Your knife?
Your knife!
It's you who killed Clark!
No...
You wanna kill Sophie?
Sophie.
It's that mad woman who killed all of them.
I haven't killed anybody!
I've seen she killed them!
You two gang up!
Run!
Freeze!
Freeze!
Freeze!
Freeze!
Freeze!
Heman!
Run!
Help!
Hurry!
Open the door!
Open the door!
Open the door...
Open the door!
Open the door!
Heman, haven't you died?
No, I haven't died
That night, when I was sleeping
Uncle Liu got out of the wardrobe and attacked me with a knife.
During the tangle, Lily got in... and she chopped Uncle Liu's head
Then she even wanted to kill me...
Luckily I dodged fast and only my leg was wound
It's painful
She was mad and I jumped off from the window
I got down along the wall after I jumped
It was dark, so she thought I fell down
Then?
Later...
I wanted to call you after she went
But I feared she would stay outside the house
I hid myself in the secret chamber of the wardrobe first
For two days?
Yes, two days
Open the door!
What should we do?
Call the police.
But the worst is...
I've found this.........
GMS phone without battery in the chamber
Battery?
Wait a minute
I got the battery...
But it was soaked
Don't know if it works
Give it a try.
T Take it.
No, it doesn't work!
Two days later... the captain will come to pick up us.
Whatever happens, I'll protect you
Why's it so silent?
There's sound from the toilet
Don't panic.
That crazy woman scares you.
I kill her.
Stay here
Freeze or I kill you!
Go!
It's him who's the murderer
The scar on your palm tells truth!
This way!
It's Heman.........he killed them!
There's a scar on his palm and the hand prints do show that
Trust me!
He wants to kill us.
I trust you certainly
What should we do?
Quiet.
Once he knows we're here, we're certainly finished
Sophie!
Sophie!
I miss you!
Beware of Lily...
She's crazy!
Get out, please.
I miss you!
Sophie...
Beware of Lily.
She's crazy!
Sophie!
Lily...
I've caught Lily.
Don't panic.
You dealt with her for the whole night
You're fagged out.
Sit down
You're fagged out.
Sit down
Sit down!
I've told you!
Sit down!
Why did you do that?
You should know the answer, right?
'cos I love you!
Love me?
So you got to kill people?
Christ!
You should know that?
They all go to hell
It's me who killed Charles, Clark and James
They all wanted to screw you
And...the worst is Ken
He cheated you
He should go to hell!
What do you want?
I just want to have a chat with you
Tell me.
What's the relationship with Sophie?
Why did she said she adores you before us?
I don't know but I love Lily
Really?
Then you cheated Sophie
Hewasworththepenalty1
You killed Ken!
It's you who killed Ken!
Yeah, it's me.
He was worthy to die
How about Uncle Liu?
Uncle Liu?
He was also a bad bloke
There aren't too many kind people in the world
He smuggled illegal spirits
He said...he'd create a story to make you go after killing me
He also said...
you put him to the troubles
no one knows...
I've killed other people if I kill her
I can live with you forever
I know...
I know you've killed other people
Right, you know but you don't tell other people
I will!
I will!
Sophie's said she'll tell people that I've killed people.
You're crazy!
Then I have to kill you...
Then I kill her... and then I commit suicide
I'm happy to die with Sophie together
I'm happy with that...
I'm happy with that!
Lily!
Sorry
Is it Ken?
We should call the police
My GMS phone loses
We've found it but Heman said it doesn't work
Phone...
Hello?
It's police call centre
It reaches the centre.........
Please send the police here!
We've contacted Heman Dai's family
The doctor's confirmed that he had leukemia
He couldn't accept this and he became emotional
Last year he was admitted to the psychiatric hospital for treatment
A week ago his family gave him your invitation
He sneaked out of the hospital
Perhaps he went to yor gathering
First, I'd like to thank the people at CJ Entertainment, Sidus Pictures, PremierEntertainment
I also would like to thank the actors and the crew for their effort and dedication.
For making the Director's Cut possible.
The birth of Director's Cut might imbue a certain type of perception that the pre-existing Theatrical Version was not what the director intended.
However, it is not true in this case.
The Theatrical Version was edited by the director as well as the Director's Cut.
I hope the narrative's newly-achieved expansiveness adds to the emotional impact of the original Theatrical Version.

A Moment To Remember
Hey...
Can I bum a light?
No, not that, Got a light?
When a memory's gone...
So is the soul, they say.
Ah, memory!
When a memory's go so is the soul.
Some story, eh?
Hey, man, let me tell you a story about memory.
When you were walking towards me.
I saw you smoking.
That's a memory.
You know what I'm awaiting here?
Not a cigarette light.
I'm waiting for the light.
Sharing a cigarette light means sharing the light.
So...
Hey Miss...
Got a light?
When will I ever smoke this?
The train is now approaching.
Please wait behind the yellow line.
70 cents.
You gave me a dollar.
Damn, not again.
Here you go.
Hurry.
Come on!
You must've been in a hurry.
So you're through with him?
What did I tell you?
I knew it!
Did you eat dinner?
Are you hungry?
Dad's gonna kill you!
Is that her?
She doesn't look stupid or anything.
Look at those eyes.
Totally foxy.
- Do you like your desk?
- Yes
Welcome to our team.
How about a fresh start on the new floor?
Being such a feminine and sensitive woman as you are...
Can you do men's wear?
You should help me.
I'll learn.
I bet you will.
You look just perfect for the job.
I'm Anna JUNG
Nice to meet you, I'm KIM Su-jin.
I've heard a lot about you.
From Young-min, your ex-boyfriend's wife.
She and I went to college together.
Oh, She's not his wife anymore.
Here?
Shorter.
Here?
You sure?
I don't get it.
Getting a cut doesn't help forget the past.
Wait!
Right here.
Don't get caught up in it.
Time heals everything.
Feels so good going out with my little girl.
Don't you hate me?
I've given the family a bad name.
You had to go to police station many times because of me...
I did?
To forget easily is a gift.
Let go of your old mistakes.
Make a fresh start.
It won't take long.
Want to come along?
Go ahead.
So dusty!
With the sleepy spring breeze all around you...
Here's a song to wake you up.
I'll be back tomorrow.
And this is the last song for today.
La Paloma.
What's wrong with you?
If we don't finish this right now, what are you gonna do with it?
Am I talking to a wall?
We're talking in circles.
Stop wasting my time!
- You son of a...
- What's the matter?
Sir!
The cement trucks are all here.
But this jerk here won't let them do theirjob.
Do you know what it'll cost us if we send them back?
Fine, go ahead, Pour the whole shit!
It won't be my mess.
Don't come crying to me later.
Damn it!
What the...
Who does he think he is?
Wait...
You're the foreman, right?
What's your name?
That's the 30th time you've asked!
It's CHOI Chul-soo.
I'm sorry, Choi
What's the problem?
Problem?
The mold isn't strong enough to hold the concrete.
- Damn!
- It rained like hell last week.
And we're not even done with the scaffolding.
What if it collapses after people move in?
Collapse?
Don'tjinx it, boy!
Okay, Choi.
Let me take a look.
No way we can finish this by tomorrow morning.
Do it the day after tomorrow for your own sake.
You don't know what you're talking about.
You're a frigging carpenter!
Look, I'm telling you this from my experience.
Do it today and it will collapse.
Do you want to be on the prime-time news?
Some temper he has!
Who?
Let's go eat.
I thought the renovations would be done by now.
I'm screwed!
They'll fire me.
I had my buddy do the project but he took the money and ran.
Dame, I already paid him.
Jesus.
Let me see what I can do.
There might be a way.
Really?
How?
I know some people.
Dad, are you sure?
Of course!
I'm your favorite pushover, am I not?
No, you're not a pushover!
You're my Christmas!
What?
I mean Santa Claus!
Enough.
I'll send someone over.
Let the guys deal with him.
Okay?
He's... rough, Very violent.
Don't mess with him.
So glad you made it!
Let's have some coffee in my office.
Where's the site?
This way.
Where's the floor plan?
We don't have any The guy ran off.
Why's the wallpaper torn?
Hey!
Pardon...
What the!
Wait!
Leave it please!
We're out of time here.
This is what you call a slapdash job.
The whole wall has to go.
Walking home?
Yes...
No!
I'm taking the busi...
No, tax...
I'm taking a taxi.
Are you okay?
Yes.
You sell these on the subway or something?
These are all here?
I lose pens all the time.
Won't it cost money to fix the door?
Get in through here.
Wait!
Wait!
Hold onto this.
Okay
Comfortable?
What's the baseball bat for?
Do you beat up people with it?
Why would you beat up people?
I'm sorry.
For what?
For snatching your coke.
I'm, you know...
I'm very... uh, very...
Forgetful!
How'd you remember me anyway?
Is this the exit?
Hey, you're seeing somebody today, right?
Don't you dare pick up a hunk alone.
Hunk?
All you girls talk about...
Looking for someone?
Well, where is...
That tall mustachio?
He's working on the site so couldn't come.
People down here are in charge now, I heard.
Thank you so much Su-jin.
Your father plays golf, right?
I'll give a call later.
- What are you doing?
- Jesus!
Oh God!
What hunks?
I don't even see ghosts.
I have to go pee!
- She has to go pee!
- Be quiet.!
Trust me on this, okay?
Let's go.
Mr. Park is a jerk.
He never pays on time.
You should push the prick to save our asses.
He'll pay on time this month.
I don't care about the style.
What kind of business are they in?
Oh, is that where we're going?
Do you have any savings at all?
Stop spending start saving.
And it's about time you Ghi-bong got married~~
You know these guys?
How's the business?
What?
Selling pens.
We were just walking by.
We have an appointment...
And I saw you.
Sit here, ladies.
We need more glasses and chopsticks here!
Get the chairs!
Haven't you seen enough of his face tonight?
Kim Su-jin!
Get me a plane!
I'm getting goose bumps!
Why don't you move in with him?
He has a lot of money put aside.
If you drink that we're going steady.
If I don't?
We will be strangers.
Until we die.
Me?
I've never done this before.
Spread them.
Keep low.
Swing like this.
Oh my...
Pick up the bat!
God!
It's too heavy.
The ball's coming!
Keep your eye on the ball.
It's already gone!
What do you have on?
Beats me.
This smell gives me a strange feeling.
Reminds me of the old days.
Was it my dad?
My uncle?
The smell makes me feel... as if I were falling into a world of dreams...
- Hey ...Something like that...
I got it from a barber.
What's this?
What?
This?
Nothing!
You study?
Taking a test or something?
Hey!
Open it and you're out of here.
Who's this?
Your grandfather?
A master templum lignarius...
What's that?
A man who builds temples.
He was my teacher.
Got an album?
Any childhood pictures?
Have you got an insatiable curiosity?
I want to see your pictures when you were little.
I haven't got any.
I've always been a grown-up.
You know this grift?
Place your bets.
Even a dog at a glance can win.
Mommy wins bread money.
Daddy wins cigarette money.
Double up your money.
Don't let your luck slip by...
The luck is right in your hands.
Pick an Ace!
Here we go again.
Place your bets.
Even a dog at a glance can win.
Mommy wins bread money.
Daddy wins cigarette money.
Double up your money.
Don't let your luck slip by...
The luck is right in your hands.
You been lost again?
Anything good happened to you?
You got the strite interval right.
It's softer than the imported fabric.
But I don't know what Anna Jung will say.
Always finding flaws.
She's just so nasty.
Don't worry.
A busy bird has no time to be upset.
Who said that?
That was...
Young-min's phrase.
How is he doing?
I haven't seen him for a while.
It's alright.
It can happen to anybody.
All we did was love.
...say some irresponsible people.
Nothing can stop me from love?
Love my ass.
Hey, what happens to the frog that got hit by the careless stone?
What frog?
You said there was a kid?
Hey, not only killing people or stealing things is a sin?
It's as much a sin to that kid.
Who'll take care of the hurt he got?
I'm the frog too!
Whatever, damn.
Let's go eat.
You're right.
I knew that too.
It's all my fault.
So I'm heart-broken too.
I'm so sorry for everyone.
- But...
- Forget it.
Okay?
Croak, croak.
Croak.
Why don't you buy one?
Well pay.
This is fun.
And good for strengthening our friendship.
Of all the cool guys why a carpenter?
Grateful?
Don't wait.
A true artist fears a blank canvas.
Good luck, guys.
What are you doing here?
I told you not to wait.
Seeing anyone lately?
No!
It's Yoon- ah, isn't it?
No, no.
She told me nothing.
A construction worker or something?
Come on, why would I go out with such a...
What does he do?
He's an architect.
Really?
Let's meet him.
No way.
No way?
No, I'm just saying...
No way?
It's just...
Dad!
Invite him over to our house
I'll take care of everything for you.
Okay?
Hell no.
Why not?
No!
Why?
Why not?
Look.
I'm seeing you.
What has that got to do with your parents?
You have to meet them... if we're going to get married.
Why no?
Don't you love me?
You love me, right?
It may fade away.
Is it that hard to say I love you?
I'm getting tired of this!
Wake up, will you?
You're a princess, and I'm a beggar!
Can you live without me?
If we live together...
can we die together too?
You come and go alone.
That's life.
You crybaby...
Have you lost your parents?
Or your country?
Look.
Why do you like me so much?
Remember that store?
No, I don't.
Go away.
I'm so scared!
How could you make a woman so miserable?
What's wrong with wanting to marry a man she loves and build a home?
This is delicious.
Why don't you use this?
Knock yourself out.
I can't make the commitment.
No, actually I don't want to commit.
Why not?
You scare me.
Why?
You're too confident.
Do you have any idea how cruel life can be?
Say we get married...
Can we be truly happy?
Dad!
Why surprised?
You invited us.
You...
You know each other?
Honey, say something.
Where are you going?
To the ladies room.
I'm sorry.
Follow me to the washroom downstairs.
Your parents?
She hasn't told you?
Do you have a home?
If you don't mind I'll get going.
You're fired.
Finish eating at least please.
No, I mean...
Wait until Su-jin comes back.
Sit!
Excuse me.
I'm very sorry about this
I will never...
Su-jin!
Su-jin, wake up!
Su-jin!
Su-jin!
She might have passed out from intense stress.
A little anemic too.
Shell be fine after a good night sleep.
Architect License
Hot!
What's wrong with me?
Done bathing?
Yeah.
You sure?
Of course.
Positive?
Did you wash your chest?
I don't know.
Your armpits?
I think so.
Your feet?
No more questions!
Stop looking!
This isn't good at all.
You'll have to redo it.
What's wrong with it?
You know we slaved over this!
Look at it from here.
Do it again.
It's not even aligned.
Again?
Come on!
This is good enough.
Nobody will notice!
Take a look.
The reflection breaks, see?
It's the angle, man.
And the spacing.
It's way off.
Do it again, okay?
Okay.
- Whose side are you!
- No, you're not redoing it!
There you go again.
Look who's talking you little jerk!
It is fine as it is!
Who do you think you are?
A damn artist?
Hey, Choi!
Say hello to Mr. Hwang.
You've met him before.
You're looking good.
Congratulations on everything.
I've been asking your father-in-law to arrange the meeting.
What would look good here?
Sorry?
What should I build here?
Rather than building something...
You may want to leave it as it is.
Leave it as it is...
But if I insist.
If you want a house.
You should leave those trees.
Natural-grown ones are different from the planted ones.
A house that... is in balance.
Uh... inside and out.
You see the pine tree over there?
Great, isn't it?
There is a reason for that.
Either it was under a rock when young.
Or shaded by a big tree nearby.
In short, it's been misplaced.
Like a pine tree on a cliff.
Hey, it's still dry.
Don't touch it.
Let's talk about the theme.
Theme?
Where did your design come from?
Where it came from?
Well...
I mean.
What was your inspiration?
My wife was the inspiration.
I had a chance to see her all happy with her family.
And that was very special to me.
So...
Walking along this hill.
Looking around the empty lot.
I made up a story of them inside.
And came up with its interior first.
This is Su-jin's grandfather's hammer.
Chul-soo.
You know Jesus, right?
Did you know he was a carpenter?
Carpenter is a holy vocation.
Chul-soo.
You know how a real carpenter is different from a sham one?
Go see at a shop.
There are so many sham ones.
They all complain about the wood.
The real carpenter.
Sees the texture.
What's the texture?
It's a possibility.
The texture gets you anything.
A real carpenter can see that.
It's the same with people.
You were all wrong.
You still are.
But I saw your texture.
You know what I mean?
You like it?
Rather than focusing on the beautiful walls.
I considered...
How people move under the roof.
Keep going.
What I mean is...
Geographic particulars demands that the drainage expansion be considered.
Ah...
This is...
The partial attachment between the column and column door.
We're planning to handcraft all the other decorations like this.
If I and my head carpenter and you, the expert carpetners are to focus on this project.
I'm sure we will make it to the date you want.
Of course...
You need to consider the budget.
Handcraft will cost you a bit more.
You signed the contract?
Were waiting, Su-jin.
Later!
Like this?
Like Michael Jordan?
No, no.
That's too common.
I think...
Well... wait.
In a restaurant when a server with a tray trips and falls.
He twists automatically and spontaneously.
Like you can support in any situation.
Like that...
Do you know what I'm saying?
Not done yet?
I'm going to be late for work.
Construction workers love rainy days.
Why do you laugh so?
It's only a cup of tea.
Kim Su-jin!
Your mouth is hanging off your ears, girl.
Are you that happy being married?
Doesn't the rain make you melancholic?
Put your bag down.
Nobody's taking it.
No, give it here.
Let me ask you something.
Have you ever gotten lost on the familiar streets?
We're not like you.
Hey you get lost all the time, too.
Even so, I never forget the way to work.
How could you?
Unless you're going senile.
Lately I've been having trouble... finding my way home.
It's so strange.
He must tire you out every night!
It seems different.
What does?
The kitchen.
What about it?
It's changed.
Has it?
Hasn't it?
No more burning pots.
You like it?
No.
I love you!
Go ahead.
My head!
What are you doing?
Sit down.
Have you ever blacked out recently?
Due to unbearable stress...
Or an emotional breakdown?
Once due to anemia.
About stress...
Is it necessary to record this?
Don't mind it.
It might help later.
Just answer my questions.
I once loved a married man.
But he didn't show up at the train station.
I was heartbroken I felt like I was dying.
A few days earlier.
I was attacked by his wife.
She pulled out a bunch of my hair.
In the cases physically dealing with emotional stress... everybody reacts differently.
Your current symptoms might have come from severe stress.
Come back next week.
We will run an MRI and CT scan on you.
Hey, take these.
Nice office!
You made it, Foreman.
Not a foreman anymore!
I'm the foreman now.
Where's my desk?
In the back?
It's not fun.
Let's get out of here.
He's not done yet.
You see this?
Everybody changes.
You can't trust anybody.
Let's go, He's changed.
I don't need this crap
Come on!
Chul-soo, make me a business card, will you?
- You don't need no business card!
- I'll pick'em up tomorrow!
Let's go!
Get back here!
- Give me your business card.
- I'll get you one.
Wow, she's so pretty.
These young girls are experts on makeups.
But no good at cooking.
Just like me.
You became more sophisticated.
You used to take it away.
Now you're asking for a loan.
Perfect timing, too.
Showed up just when I got out of the bottom.
Do I owe you anything?
You don't know how I pray for your success.
Don't be stingy about a few dollars.
That's so cheap.
Did you say cheap?
You look so much better.
Oh, my boy.
Your wife takes good care of you, right?
So, what is it?
Will you do it for me?
You have your men.
Ask your giglos.
What?
Giglos?
Hey, watch what you say to your mom.
You're worse than before now.
You think I got that money all for myself?
Didn't you?
You know you shouldn't borrow money from gangs.
You'll go to jail.
Jail?
How can you say that?
Okay, okay.
I'm leaving.
I'll list you as my insurance beneficiary.
So take that with your pretty wife, you asshole.
We just met in three years and that's all you say?
Can't you loan me a half of it?
I'll take care of the rest.
7% interest is perfect you know.
Okay, fine.
I'll never come to see you again.
Asshole.
If you hear about a corpse in a river.
You know it's me.
You, jerk.
I don't expect you to bury my body either.
Bastard...
You're such a mean son.
Which way is south?
That way.
So the front door will be here.
All the electronics go here.
And here's the bathroom.
- A big one This big!
- What about our room?
Our room?
Where do you want it?
There?
There it is!
A great choice!
We'll wake up with sunshine on our faces... eat breakfast over here and watch TV there.
Waitjust a little.
I've been eyeing this lot for 3 years now.
Nothing but horrible memories...
He beat me for no reason and treated me like a slave.
Giving me nothing but food and a place to sleep.
Just one mean old fart!
When I was 9, he put a hammer in my hand for the first time.
It was so heavy...
If it weren't for him, I would never have become a carpenter.
I hated him.
Still building this temple?
It's been over 10 years.
What do you want?
My wife wants to see you.
What's the point of coming after the wedding?
Do you wipe your ass before you shit?
Bastard!
You carved it too deep!
What have you done?
The angle is way off!
Let me go get some mountain water.
Here.
You have pretty hands.
Have you met his mother?
What?
Your mother-in-law!
No.
He hasn't let you?
No.
That little bastard is still mad at her?
It's about time he forgave her.
It was so long ago.
Demurrer to Seizure
I don't have a mother.
She's still your mother.
I don't have one.
She's your mother.
Do you know how hard I've worked for that money?
Why should I give it to someone I hardly know?
No way in hell!
Let's stop it.
She's your family.
Family?
I have my family right here and this is my home.
And you're my family!
Okay?
I'm building our new house with that money.
If we move into that new house...
You think we'll be happy?
Damn!
Drop it.
Why is it so hard to forgive her?
- Forgiveness is...
- Stop it!
What are parents?
The one's that give you life?
And then theirjob is over?
What do you know about her?
Who do you think you are trying to help her?
Cut it out.
Stop crying.
You know why I never cry?
I ran out of tears that night.
When she left me, dumped me over to this old man,
I cried all night long!
I will never cry again for that woman... nor give her a penny.
Forgiving... isn't that hard.
It's just... giving away just one plain room in your heart.
My grandpa said so.
A true carpenter... is the one that can build a house in his heart.
But in the house you've built.
So well in your heart...
You gave all the rooms away to your mother and to your hate.
And where are you?
And you're shivering outside the house.
I understand.
I know it's hard to forgive.
But...
My dad remembered that piece of wisdom... and forgave me when I almost ran off with a married man... and he permitted our marriage so easily.
You know why?
Forgiving... is giving your hate just a little room in your heart.
Forget it.
Who asked for your help?
Came to see if I'm dead?
You're no different from you dad.
You bastard!
You're one merciless malicious son of a bitch!
I wasn't myself when I had you when I was seventeen.
I should've had an abortion.
Erase you out of my misery!
What was I thinking!
Let's see how good you do without a mother!
Get the hell out of here.
I don't need you.
Go!
Get out of here, Go!
56 thousand dollars.
Damn, new shit...
How much in total?
Overdue interest...
On top of that...
It's over 90 grand.
It's a lot of money.
Don't you think?
We're broke now.
Fine.
I'll pay.
Didn't I tell you I would?
Check please!
Place your bets.
Even a dog at a glance can win.
Chul-soo wins cigarette money Su-jin wins bread money.
Don't let your luck slip by...
The luck is right in your hands.
Pick an Ace!
An Ace!
What's the date today?
Do you know?
I always lose track of the date.
I told you to come back in a week, not two.
Any siblings?
One sister.
Okay.
How old is she?
Twenty.
No...
Nineteen maybe?
I'm bad with numbers.
Give me her birthday.
What color is the light for the walk signal?
What kind of questions are these?
Just answer the question.
What was the question?
What do you call your mother's sister?
What's 18 plus 19?
If I fly a balloon when the wind moving westward... which way will it go?
I don't know if this is good news or bad news.
I just found out myself.
Pardon me?
I'm telling you the truth.
For real?
I don't believe you.
Close the door, will you?
Sit.
I'll stand.
I'm back for good.
They closed the branch in Paris.
I've heard.
Well be working together.
The table has turned though.
Now I'm single and you're married.
Is fate playing with us?
Look...
I couldn't make it that day because I was...
I don't remember anything.
See you at the clothing lab.
Now were in the same boat.
It's only a beginning.
Let's make this work.
A busy worker ant doesn't have time to be sad, right?
That's the spirit!
- Good job, guys.
- Congratulations.
Don't lose it.
Is this important?
Where were you?
You glued it?
No.
What did the doctor say?
Told me to come back next week.
Again?
How long will it take to fill this out?
Say something, Doctor.
Analyzing the MRI and PET scan... and all the test results...
Abnormal proteins have clogged up the veins in your brain... affecting the brain cells.
I don't understand a word you're saying.
Speak English please.
I'm certain the cause is largely genetic.
A very rare case.
You have...
Alzheimer's disease.
What?
Alz... what?
Alzheimer.
Alzheimer?
What's that?
The questions I asked were to diagnose dementia.
But I'm only 27.
How could I be going senile?
It's possible.
So...
What's going to happen to me?
A mental death will come before a physical one.
Better prepare yourself for what's inevitable.
Medicine can slow it down.
But that's about it.
What about surgery?
Do you work?
Yes.
You should quit right away.
Soon you won't be able to type or answer the phone... let alone organize things.
Pretty much nothing.
You will forget your family, friends and even yourself.
All your memories will disappear completely.
Should I quit my job?
Why?
Why don't I stay home and do the chores?
Sure, I'd like that.
Why suddenly?
I don't know.
Tired of working?
It's dog-eat-dog out there I'll bring home the bread and milk.
Quit right away.
Maybe I'll quit tomorrow?
Hold on.
What's going on?
Do you want a baby?
A baby?
I don't know.
Never thought about it.
Do it for me.
What?
That.
What?
That...
You mean... in-and-out?
No, that thing you do with cards.
Grift?
You never win.
Just once.
No, I'm tired.
Please just once.
You're not saying it?
Place your bets.
Even a dog at a glance can win.
Su-jin wins bread money.
Chul-soo wins cigarette money.
Double up your money.
Don't let your luck slip by...
The luck is right in your hands.
Pick an Ace!
An Ace!
You win.
Won't you be bored?
No.
Hello?
Young-min here.
How could you quit without notice?
If it's me let's meet and talk.
No.
I'm not hitting on you!
- I just...
- You want to quit, then follow the rule!
- I just want to stay home.
- What's wrong with you!
If you don't feel comfortable with me we can meet with other colleagues.
I'll come to the office.
- Here you go.
- Give me one of those
You packed a lunch?
How nice!
The color is so tacky!
Let's see what you have.
Rice!
Looks so good!
What about side dishes?
Is that for me?
You shouldn't have!
Maybe... you've confused her with someone else with the same name?
Or the wrong documents...
Hands off!
You won't understand it anyway!
It's your wife.
Are you crazy?
You okay, Ma'am?
Why the hell did you tell her everything?
Why the hell did you tell her everything?
I am a doctor.
She needs time to prepare for what's coming.
- You sure about this?
- Of course!
Positive?
If you don't believe me, take her to another doctor.
Doctor!
Are you sure!
You crazy?
What's wrong with you?
- Are you sure?
- This is a hospital!
Are you sure?
Calm down, sir!
His wife died from it, too.
He's spent half of his life researching Alzheimer's.
Accept what's real.
You can't change it
Are you alright?
Do you need to see a doctor?
Just little bit more...
Where are you going?
- I have no idea.
- Excuse me?
I don't believe it.
They are cloning human-beings nowadays.
There must be a cure for this.
I understand.
But your wife is a rare case.
Her symptoms are very close to my wife's.
It's an old story...
Before my wife died...
I took her to the place we first met.
Incredibly, she remembered almost everything then.
I was just so happy that I couldn't hold back my tears.
I thought things were coming back to her.
I was so happy.
And about 3 hours later.
She looked at me and said...
Who are you?
Why are you crying so?
That's what she said.
Hah, that's a mystery of human brains, isn't it?
I'm telling you this from my own experience.
You can't find it in books.
- Hello?
- Who's this?
I found this cell phone on the street.
What happened?
What happened to her?
That's...
How can I explain this?
Young-min.
Can we go back to...
two years ago?
Two years ago?
What for?
That's even before we met.
What?
What are you thinking about?
Su-jin!
Fool.
Keep your eye on the ball.
It's strange.
I only got 9 balls.
It's actually 10, right?
Isn't it?
Did you find out?
What?
That I have an eraser in my head.
- Let's part ways.
- What?
You were right.
One can't be happy forever.
- What are you talking about?
- It's all over.
Think about it.
What's love good for if my memory is gone?
Don't be so nice to me.
I'll forget everything.
I'll remember everything for you.
You know I'm smart.
I passed the architect test on the first try.
You're too confident.
Life can be very cruel.
You didn't forget that.
How could I?
You're mean.
Don't worry.
There'll be a cure...
You crybaby!
Have you lost your parents or your country?
I'll just leave.
Please let me go, okay?
Want to have a go?
Want to bet on it?
Damn!
Why are you crying?
I said I'd remember everything for you!
You know what?
If you forget everything I will pop up out of nowhere.
Like this.
And I'll hit on you.
You won't be able to turn me down.
We'll start afresh every day.
Like permanent dating.
Awesome, isn't it?
You're going to grow a goatee again?
Don't bother.
Let's forget everything while were happy.
I'll forget everything soon.
I won't know why you're with me.
You'll be gone out of my head.
And so will I.
You understand that?
As my memory disappears my soul will disappear too.
I'm scared!
Why would your soul disappear?
Get up.
Leave it to me.
I'm your memory.
I'm your heart.
Got that?
No more tears!
Our address is...
Hwagok, Gangseo district, 464... 2... 2... 2 1?
Who am I?
Choi Chul-soo.
And you?
Kim Su-jin.
I feel all better already.
Good.
Kim Su-jin.
Come home early.
Okay.
By six.
Okay.
What for?
Do you want to go somewhere?
It's your moms birthday Forgot again?
Take these.
I've also invited my parents and your carpenter teacher.
I'll cook lots of food.
Don't be late.
Honey?
It's yours.
See if...
Did you eat yet?
Hold on.
Having a party today or something?
What party?
Never mind.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
Why bother?
Go wash up.
We're eating soon.
Remember what happened the other day on the street?
What?
I'm married?
What are you saying?
You're not?
What's wrong, Young-min?
Are you trying to dump me?
Please don't!
What are you talking about?
Come to your senses.
Wake up!
Su-jin, are you okay?
Who's that guy?
I just...
Come here!
Let's go.
- Come here!
- What are you doing?
- Come on!
- Let go of me!
Wait!
Wait...
Wait...
Wait... wait!
Go ahead kill me.
She's fed up with you.
She wants to go back to the days with me, got that?
Good for you.
Congratulations!
You must be happy.
You'll be happier in hell!
Happy now?
Happy?
Happy?
You're still young.
We'll take care of her.
No.
It runs in the family.
She seems fine now... but soon she wont be able to control her bladder and worse.
You can't handle that.
She's my wife.
I'm taking care of her.
I know how you feel.
But you need to be reasonable.
Stop it.
She's staying with me.
Don't be so stubborn!
Enough!
- Please leave.
- Chul-soo!
Su-jin?
What's going on?
Anything wrong?
Su-jin!
Are you okay?
Open the door.
It's Mom!
Open the door!
Su-jin!
- Su-jin, my poor baby...
- What happened to your arm?
Su-jin!
Su-jin, open the door.
It's your mom.
It's me.
Happy birthday.
Keep out
Can the window be bigger?
Why not?
I'll fix it later tonight
How much bigger?
I don't know.
Just want more sun.
Okay.
Bye.
Young-min.
Yes?
I love you.
Me, too.
I'll be home early.
One at a time!
She doesn't recognize me anymore.
She doesn't?
I know how that feels but don't let it eat you up.
It's the recent memories that disappear first.
That's what Alzheimer's does.
No point in blaming the patient.
Looking straight into my eyes...
She calls me by the name of her ex-Iover.
And she says I love you.
Who does she really love?
She misses those days.
Right?
That's just what remains in her memory.
You received her love, not me.
Ask yourself.
What the hell are you talking about?
You got us redo this three times already.
Now that you're in suits want to have fun with your wife?
While we finish up all this?
Damn, let's talk sense here, man.
Chil-bok, I...
Who am I?
What?
Am I that bad?
What's wrong?
Hey, Chul-soo Greatjob, isn't it?
- Chul-soo!
- Chul-soo...
Chul-soo!
How to read time.
Su-jin, Chul-soo
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I never meant to break your heart.
God, what have I done?
Are you crying now?
I didn't want to see you crying or in pain.
I wanted to make you happy.
But all I've done is put you in agony.
Chul-soo!
Oh my love Chul-soo.
Don't get me wrong.
I only love you and only you.
I only think of you.
I only remember you.
How badly do I wish to show you my heart!
Is there any way I can do that while my memory remains?
Oh, my heart races.
I, Kim Su-jin love you Choi Chul-soo, only.
I don't want to forget that.
And I must not.
Can you see that?
Can you feel my heart?
I'm afraid my just-returned memory will leave me again before I tell you everything I have to say.
I love you.
And I'm sorry.
I met you because I was forgetful.
I'm leaving you because I'm forgetful.
You were the best thing that ever happened to me.
How thankful I am to God for having sent you as gift to me.
I don't have to remember you.
You're a part of me.
I smile, laugh, and smell like you do.
I might forget you, but nothing can drive you out of my body.
Although youve never told me you loved me...
I know deep in my heart that you love me.
Forgive me for leaving you.
Please...
For the last time I have a favor to ask.
Please see my father.
Petition for Divorce
You've had a hard time ever since you were born.
That miserable pain of the past... is about to bring you a fortune.
And you are blowing it away?
Does it make sense?
Go!
Go back to work!
Man, Su-jin...
Do you know the saying...
Forgiving is just giving your hate a little room in your heart?
She's given me a lot.
I have something to tell her...
before she forgets me completely.
If I don't... my life will be meaningless.
Missing Person
Can I ask you this
When the memory calls
I can talk about our love story all over again
You watching me asleep and You in my dream
Will never fade away A memory to remember forever
I like dust.
When it's all over me...
It feels good.
When the sadness is all over me.
I can just...
Just dust it off.
Light...
Got a light?
Love and money are like this cigarettes.
What's the use without a light?
Can you love without light?
Cigarette...
I'll just chuck it away.
Chuck it, chuck it.
Chuck it, chuck it.
Same with your sadness like this...
You're turning away
I can't hide my tears
I couldn't say I love you
I yearn for that time I had with you
My beloved memory cannot be erased...
Want to have a go again?
Hey.
You're so inconsiderate.
You should've given me a chance.
How could you leave me like that?
I'm all alone again.
Choi Chul-soo
Gangneung
Strangely, I remember everything today.
The batting range, the store...
everything!
Maybe this is the last time.
So I'm writing to you while I can.
The highest mountain in Korea is Mt.
Baekdu 2,7 44 meters.
That coke I snatched from you was 70 cents.
I'm doing well.
The second highest is Mt.
Halla 1,950 meters.
See?
You don't have to worry about me.
Santa Clause is December 25
Pretty good, right?
You can forget me now to make us even.
Meet someone nice and be happy.
Don't lose your temper.
You don't look cool.
You might not know it but you're a good husband.
I know that for a fact because I was your wife.
Don't try to find me, Chul-soo.
Goodbye.
Some days she can't get dressed without help.
Shes adapting well though.
She tore up all the pictures except that one.
This way.
You have a visitor.
A visitor?
Thank you.
Don't you... recognize me?
Do I know you?
Nice to meet you.
I'm Choi Chul-soo.
This smell...
I have heard from somewhere...
My uncle...
The bus...
Somewhere...
My memory...
Dreams...
Dreams...
I can't remember...
Why are you crying?
Is she allowed to take a trip?
Is this heaven?
Yes.
I love you!

A Moment To Remember
Hey...
Can I burn a light?
No, not that, Got a light?
When a memory's gone...
So is the soul, they say.
Ah, memory!
When a memory's go so is the soul.
Some story, eh?
Hey, man, let me tell you a story about memory.
When you were walking towards me.
I saw you smoking.
That's a memory.
You know what I'm awaiting here?
Not a cigarette light.
I'm waiting for the light.
Sharing a cigarette light means sharing the light.
So...
Hey Miss...
Got a light?
When will I ever smoke this?
The train is now approaching.
Please wait behind the yellow line.
70 cents.
You gave me a dollar.
Damn, not again.
Here you go.
Hurry.
Come on!
You must've been in a hurry.
So you're through with him?
What did I tell you?
I knew it!
Did you eat dinner?
Are you hungry?
Dad's gonna kill you!
Is that her?
She doesn't look stupid or anything.
Look at those eyes.
Totally foxy.
- Do you like your desk?
- Yes
Welcome to our team.
How about a fresh start on the new floor?
Being such a feminine and sensitive woman as you are...
Can you do men's wear?
You should help me.
I'll learn.
I bet you will.
You look just perfect for the job.
I'm Anna JUNG
Nice to meet you, I'm KIM Su-jin.
I've heard a lot about you.
From Young-min, your ex-boyfriend's wife.
She and I went to college together.
Oh, She's not his wife anymore.
Here?
Shorter.
Here?
You sure?
I don't get it.
Getting a cut doesn't help forget the past.
Wait!
Right here.
Don't get caught up in it.
Time heals everything.
Feels so good going out with my little girl.
Don't you hate me?
I've given the family a bad name.
You had to go to police station many times because of me...
I did?
To forget easily is a gift.
Let go of your old mistakes.
Make a fresh start.
It won't take long.
Want to come along?
Go ahead.
So dusty!
With the sleepy spring breeze all around you...
Here's a song to wake you up.
I'll be back tomorrow.
And this is the last song for today.
La Paloma.
What's wrong with you?
If we don't finish this right now, what are you gonna do with it?
Am I talking to a wall?
We're talking in circles.
Stop wasting my time!
- You son of a...
- What's the matter?
Sir!
The cement trucks are all here.
But this jerk here won't let them do their job.
Do you know what it'll cost us if we send them back?
Fine, go ahead, Pour the whole shit!
It won't be my mess.
Don't come crying to me later.
Damn it!
What the...
Who does he think he is?
Wait...
You're the foreman, right?
What's your name?
That's the 30th time you've asked!
It's CHOI Chul-soo.
I'm sorry, Choi
What's the problem?
Problem?
The mold isn't strong enough to hold the concrete.
- Damn!
- It rained like hell last week.
And we're not even done with the scaffolding.
What if it collapses after people move in?
Collapse?
Don't jinx it, boy!
Okay, Choi.
Let me take a look.
No way we can finish this by tomorrow morning.
Do it the day after tomorrow for your own sake.
You don't know what you're talking about.
You're a frigging carpenter!
Look, I'm telling you this from my experience.
Do it today and it will collapse.
Do you want to be on the prime-time news?
Some temper he has!
Who?
Let's go eat.
I thought the renovations would be done by now.
I'm screwed!
They'll fire me.
I had my buddy do the project but he took the money and ran.
Damn, I already paid him.
Jesus.
Let me see what I can do.
There might be a way.
Really?
How?
I know some people.
Dad, are you sure?
Of course!
I'm your favorite pushover, am I not?
No, you're not a pushover!
You're my Christmas!
What?
I mean Santa Claus!
Enough.
I'll send someone over.
Let the guys deal with him.
Okay?
He's... rough, Very violent.
Don't mess with him.
So glad you made it!
Let's have some coffee in my office.
Where's the site?
This way.
Where's the floor plan?
We don't have any The guy ran off.
Why's the wallpaper torn?
Hey!
Pardon...
What the!
Wait!
Leave it please!
We're out of time here.
This is what you call a slapdash job.
The whole wall has to go.
Walking home?
Yes...
No!
I'm taking the bus...
No, taxi...
I'm taking a taxi.
Are you okay?
Yes.
You sell these on the subway or something?
These are all here?
I lose pens all the time.
Won't it cost money to fix the door?
Get in through here.
Wait!
Wait!
Hold onto this.
Okay
Comfortable?
What's the baseball bat for?
Do you beat up people with it?
Why would you beat up people?
I'm sorry.
For what?
For snatching your coke.
I'm, you know...
I'm very... uh, very...
Forgetful!
How'd you remember me anyway?
Is this the exit?
Hey, you're seeing somebody today, right?
Don't you dare pick up a hunk alone.
Hunk?
All you girls talk about...
Looking for someone?
Well, where is...
That tall mustachio?
He's working on the site so couldn't come.
People down here are in charge now, I heard.
Thank you so much Su-jin.
Your father plays golf, right?
I'll give a call later.
- What are you doing?
- Jesus!
Oh God!
What hunks?
I don't even see ghosts.
I have to go pee!
- She has to go pee!
- Be quiet.!
Trust me on this, okay?
Let's go.
Mr. Park is a jerk.
He never pays on time.
You should push the prick to save our asses.
He'll pay on time this month.
I don't care about the style.
What kind of business are they in?
Oh, is that where we're going?
Do you have any savings at all?
Stop spending start saving.
And it's about time you Ghi-bong got married~~
You know these guys?
How's the business?
What?
Selling pens.
We were just walking by.
We have an appointment...
And I saw you.
Sit here, ladies.
We need more glasses and chopsticks here!
Get the chairs!
Haven't you seen enough of his face tonight?
Kim Su-jin!
Get me a plane!
I'm getting goose bumps!
Why don't you move in with him?
He has a lot of money put aside.
If you drink that we're going steady.
If I don't?
We will be strangers.
Until we die.
Me?
I've never done this before.
Spread them.
Keep low.
Swing like this.
Oh my...
Pick up the bat!
God!
It's too heavy.
The ball's coming!
Keep your eye on the ball.
It's already gone!
What do you have on?
Beats me.
This smell gives me a strange feeling.
Reminds me of the old days.
Was it my dad?
My uncle?
The smell makes me feel... as if I were falling into a world of dreams...
- Hey ...Something like that...
I got it from a barber.
What's this?
What?
This?
Nothing!
You study?
Taking a test or something?
Hey!
Open it and you're out of here.
Who's this?
Your grandfather?
A master templum lignarius...
What's that?
A man who builds temples.
He was my teacher.
Got an album?
Any childhood pictures?
Have you got an insatiable curiosity?
I want to see your pictures when you were little.
I haven't got any.
I've always been a grown-up.
You know this grift?
Place your bets.
Even a dog at a glance can win.
Mommy wins bread money.
Daddy wins cigarette money.
Double up your money.
Don't let your luck slip by...
The luck is right in your hands.
Pick an Ace!
Here we go again.
Place your bets.
Even a dog at a glance can win.
Mommy wins bread money.
Daddy wins cigarette money.
Double up your money.
Don't let your luck slip by...
The luck is right in your hands.
You been lost again?
Anything good happened to you?
You got the strite interval right.
It's softer than the imported fabric.
But I don't know what Anna Jung will say.
Always finding flaws.
She's just so nasty.
Don't worry.
A busy bird has no time to be upset.
Who said that?
That was...
Young-min's phrase.
How is he doing?
I haven't seen him for a while.
It's alright.
It can happen to anybody.
All we did was love.
...say some irresponsible people.
Nothing can stop me from love?
Love my ass.
Hey, what happens to the frog that got hit by the careless stone?
What frog?
You said there was a kid?
Hey, not only killing people or stealing things is a sin?
It's as much a sin to that kid.
Who'll take care of the hurt he got?
I'm the frog too!
Whatever, damn.
Let's go eat.
You're right.
I knew that too.
It's all my fault.
So I'm heart-broken too.
I'm so sorry for everyone.
- But...
- Forget it.
Okay?
Croak, croak.
Croak.
Why don't you buy one?
We'll pay.
This is fun.
And good for strengthening our friendship.
Of all the cool guys why a carpenter?
Grateful?
Don't wait.
A true artist fears a blank canvas.
Good luck, guys.
What are you doing here?
I told you not to wait.
Seeing anyone lately?
No!
It's Yoon- ah, isn't it?
No, no.
She told me nothing.
A construction worker or something?
Come on, why would I go out with such a...
What does he do?
He's an architect.
Really?
Let's meet him.
No way.
No way?
No, I'm just saying...
No way?
It's just...
Dad!
Invite him over to our house
I'll take care of everything for you.
Okay?
Hell no.
Why not?
No!
Why?
Why not?
Look.
I'm seeing you.
What has that got to do with your parents?
You have to meet them... if we're going to get married.
Why no?
Don't you love me?
You love me, right?
It may fade away.
Is it that hard to say I love you?
I'm getting tired of this!
Wake up, will you?
You're a princess, and I'm a beggar!
Can you live without me?
If we live together...
can we die together too?
You come and go alone.
That's life.
You crybaby...
Have you lost your parents?
Or your country?
Look.
Why do you like me so much?
Remember that store?
No, I don't.
Go away.
I'm so scared!
How could you make a woman so miserable?
What's wrong with wanting to marry a man she loves and build a home?
This is delicious.
Why don't you use this?
Knock yourself out.
I can't make the commitment.
No, actually I don't want to commit.
Why not?
You scare me.
Why?
You're too confident.
Do you have any idea how cruel life can be?
Say we get married...
Can we be truly happy?
Dad!
Why surprised?
You invited us.
You...
You know each other?
Honey, say something.
Where are you going?
To the ladies room.
I'm sorry.
Follow me to the washroom downstairs.
Your parents?
She hasn't told you?
Do you have a home?
If you don't mind I'll get going.
You're fired.
Finish eating at least please.
No, I mean...
Wait until Su-jin comes back.
Sit!
Excuse me.
I'm very sorry about this
I will never...
Su-jin!
Su-jin, wake up!
Su-jin!
Su-jin!
She might have passed out from intense stress.
A little anemic too.
She'll be fine after a good night sleep.
Architect License
Hot!
What's wrong with me?
Done bathing?
Yeah.
You sure?
Of course.
Positive?
Did you wash your chest?
I don't know.
Your armpits?
I think so.
Your feet?
No more questions!
Stop looking!
This isn't good at all.
You'll have to redo it.
What's wrong with it?
You know we slaved over this!
Look at it from here.
Do it again.
It's not even aligned.
Again?
Come on!
This is good enough.
Nobody will notice!
Take a look.
The reflection breaks, see?
It's the angle, man.
And the spacing.
It's way off.
Do it again, okay?
Okay.
- Whose side are you!
- No, you're not redoing it!
There you go again.
Look who's talking you little jerk!
It is fine as it is!
Who do you think you are?
A damn artist?
Hey, Choi!
Say hello to Mr. Hwang.
You've met him before.
You're looking good.
Congratulations on everything.
I've been asking your father-in-law to arrange the meeting.
What would look good here?
Sorry?
What should I build here?
Rather than building something...
You may want to leave it as it is.
Leave it as it is...
But if I insist.
If you want a house.
You should leave those trees.
Natural-grown ones are different from the planted ones.
A house that... is in balance.
uh... inside and out.
You see the pine tree over there?
Great, isn't it?
There is a reason for that.
Either it was under a rock when young.
Or shaded by a big tree nearby.
In short, it's been misplaced.
Like a pine tree on a cliff.
Hey, it's still dry.
Don't touch it.
Let's talk about the theme.
Theme?
Where did your design come from?
Where it came from?
Well...
I mean.
What was your inspiration?
My wife was the inspiration.
I had a chance to see her all happy with her family.
And that was very special to me.
So...
Walking along this hill.
Looking around the empty lot.
I made up a story of them inside.
And came up with its interior first.
This is Su-jin's grandfather's hammer.
Chul-soo.
You know Jesus, right?
Did you know he was a carpenter?
Carpenter is a holy vocation.
Chul-soo.
You know how a real carpenter is different from a sham one?
Go see at a shop.
There are so many sham ones.
They all complain about the wood.
The real carpenter.
Sees the texture.
What's the texture?
It's a possibility.
The texture gets you anything.
A real carpenter can see that.
It's the same with people.
You were all wrong.
You still are.
But I saw your texture.
You know what I mean?
You like it?
Rather than focusing on the beautiful walls.
I considered...
How people move under the roof.
Keep going.
What I mean is...
Geographic particulars demands that the drainage expansion be considered.
Ah...
This is...
The partial attachment between the column and column door.
We're planning to handcraft all the other decorations like this.
If I and my head carpenter and you, the expert carpetners are to focus on this project.
I'm sure we will make it to the date you want.
Of course...
You need to consider the budget.
Handcraft will cost you a bit more.
You signed the contract?
We're waiting, Su-jin.
Later!
Like this?
Like Michael Jordan?
No, no.
That's too common.
I think...
Well... wait.
In a restaurant when a server with a tray trips and falls.
He twists automatically and spontaneously.
Like you can support in any situation.
Like that...
Do you know what I'm saying?
Not done yet?
I'm going to be late for work.
Construction workers love rainy days.
Why do you laugh so?
It's only a cup of tea.
Kim Su-jin!
Your mouth is hanging off your ears, girl.
Are you that happy being married?
Doesn't the rain make you melancholic?
Put your bag down.
Nobody's taking it.
No, give it here.
Let me ask you something.
Have you ever gotten lost on the familiar streets?
We're not like you.
Hey you get lost all the time, too.
Even so, I never forget the way to work.
How could you?
Unless you're going senile.
Lately I've been having trouble... finding my way home.
It's so strange.
He must tire you out every night!
It seems different.
What does?
The kitchen.
What about it?
It's changed.
Has it?
Hasn't it?
No more burning pots.
You like it?
No.
I love you!
Go ahead.
My head!
What are you doing?
Sit down.
Have you ever blacked out recently?
Due to unbearable stress...
Or an emotional breakdown?
Once due to anemia.
About stress...
Is it necessary to record this?
Don't mind it.
It might help later.
Just answer my questions.
I once loved a married man.
But he didn't show up at the train station.
I was heartbroken I felt like I was dying.
A few days earlier.
I was attacked by his wife.
She pulled out a bunch of my hair.
In the cases physically dealing with emotional stress... everybody reacts differently.
Your current symptoms might have come from severe stress.
Come back next week.
We will run an MRI and CT scan on you.
Hey, take these.
Nice office!
You made it, Foreman.
Not a foreman anymore!
I'm the foreman now.
Where's my desk?
In the back?
It's not fun.
Let's get out of here.
He's not done yet.
You see this?
Everybody changes.
You can't trust anybody.
Let's go, He's changed.
I don't need this crap
Come on!
Chul-soo, make me a business card, will you?
- You don't need no business card!
- I'll pick'em up tomorrow!
Let's go!
Get back here!
- Give me your business card.
- I'll get you one.
Wow, she's so pretty.
These young girls are experts on makeups.
But no good at cooking.
Just like me.
You became more sophisticated.
You used to take it away.
Now you're asking for a loan.
Perfect timing, too.
Showed up just when I got out of the bottom.
Do I owe you anything?
You don't know how I pray for your success.
Don't be stingy about a few dollars.
That's so cheap.
Did you say cheap?
You look so much better.
Oh, my boy.
Your wife takes good care of you, right?
So, what is it?
Will you do it for me?
You have your men.
Ask your giglos.
What?
Giglos?
Hey, watch what you say to your mom.
You're worse than before now.
You think I got that money all for myself?
Didn't you?
You know you shouldn't borrow money from gangs.
You'll go to jail.
Jail?
How can you say that?
Okay, okay.
I'm leaving.
I'll list you as my insurance beneficiary.
So take that with your pretty wife, you asshole.
We just met in three years and that's all you say?
Can't you loan me a half of it?
I'll take care of the rest.
7% interest is perfect you know.
Okay, fine.
I'll never come to see you again.
Asshole.
If you hear about a corpse in a river.
You know it's me.
You, jerk.
I don't expect you to bury my body either.
Bastard...
You're such a mean son.
Which way is south?
That way.
So the front door will be here.
All the electronics go here.
And here's the bathroom.
- A big one This big!
- What about our room?
Our room?
Where do you want it?
There?
There it is!
A great choice!
We'll wake up with sunshine on our faces... eat breakfast over here and watch TV there.
Wait just a little.
I've been eyeing this lot for 3 years now.
Nothing but horrible memories...
He beat me for no reason and treated me like a slave.
Giving me nothing but food and a place to sleep.
Just one mean old fart!
When I was 9, he put a hammer in my hand for the first time.
It was so heavy...
If it weren't for him, I would never have become a carpenter.
I hated him.
Still building this temple?
It's been over 10 years.
What do you want?
My wife wants to see you.
What's the point of coming after the wedding?
Do you wipe your ass before you shit?
Bastard!
You carved it too deep!
What have you done?
The angle is way off!
Let me go get some mountain water.
Here.
You have pretty hands.
Have you met his mother?
What?
Your mother-in-law!
No.
He hasn't let you?
No.
That little bastard is still mad at her?
It's about time he forgave her.
It was so long ago.
Demurrer to Seizure
I don't have a mother.
She's still your mother.
I don't have one.
She's your mother.
Do you know how hard I've worked for that money?
Why should I give it to someone I hardly know?
No way in hell!
Let's stop it.
She's your family.
Family?
I have my family right here and this is my home.
And you're my family!
Okay?
I'm building our new house with that money.
If we move into that new house...
You think we'll be happy?
Damn!
Drop it.
Why is it so hard to forgive her?
- Forgiveness is...
- Stop it!
What are parents?
The one's that give you life?
And then their job is over?
What do you know about her?
Who do you think you are trying to help her?
Cut it out.
Stop crying.
You know why I never cry?
I ran out of tears that night.
When she left me, dumped me over to this old man,
I cried all night long!
I will never cry again for that woman... nor give her a penny.
Forgiving... isn't that hard.
It's just... giving away just one plain room in your heart.
My grandpa said so.
A true carpenter... is the one that can build a house in his heart.
But in the house you've built.
So we'll in your heart...
You gave all the rooms away to your mother and to your hate.
And where are you?
And you're shivering outside the house.
I understand.
I know it's hard to forgive.
But...
My dad remembered that piece of wisdom... and forgave me when I almost ran off with a married man... and he permitted our marriage so easily.
You know why?
Forgiving... is giving your hate just a little room in your heart.
Forget it.
Who asked for your help?
Came to see if I'm dead?
You're no different from you dad.
You bastard!
You're one merciless malicious son of a bitch!
I wasn't myself when I had you when I was seventeen.
I should've had an abortion.
Erase you out of my misery!
What was I thinking!
Let's see how good you do without a mother!
Get the hell out of here.
I don't need you.
Go!
Get out of here, Go!
56 thousand dollars.
Damn, new shit...
How much in total?
Overdue interest...
On top of that...
It's over 90 grand.
It's a lot of money.
Don't you think?
We're broke now.
Fine.
I'll pay.
Didn't I tell you I would?
Check please!
Place your bets.
Even a dog at a glance can win.
Chul-soo wins cigarette money Su-jin wins bread money.
Don't let your luck slip by...
The luck is right in your hands.
Pick an Ace!
An Ace!
What's the date today?
Do you know?
I always lose track of the date.
I told you to come back in a week, not two.
Any siblings?
One sister.
Okay.
How old is she?
Twenty.
No...
Nineteen maybe?
I'm bad with numbers.
Give me her birthday.
What color is the light for the walk signal?
What kind of questions are these?
Just answer the question.
What was the question?
What do you call your mother's sister?
What's 18 plus 19?
If I fly a balloon when the wind moving westward... which way will it go?
I don't know if this is good news or bad news.
I just found out myself.
Pardon me?
I'm telling you the truth.
For real?
I don't believe you.
Close the door, will you?
Sit.
I'll stand.
I'm back for good.
They closed the branch in Paris.
I've heard.
We'll be working together.
The table has turned though.
Now I'm single and you're married.
Is fate playing with us?
Look...
I couldn't make it that day because I was...
I don't remember anything.
See you at the clothing lab.
Now we're in the same boat.
It's only a beginning.
Let's make this work.
A busy worker ant doesn't have time to be sad, right?
That's the spirit!
- Good job, guys.
- Congratulations.
Don't lose it.
Is this important?
Where were you?
You glued it?
No.
What did the doctor say?
Told me to come back next week.
Again?
How long will it take to fill this out?
Say something, Doctor.
Analyzing the MRI and PET scan... and all the test results...
Abnormal proteins have clogged up the veins in your brain... affecting the brain cells.
I don't understand a word you're saying.
Speak English please.
I'm certain the cause is largely genetic.
A very rare case.
You have...
Alzheimer's disease.
What?
Alz... what?
Alzheimer.
Alzheimer?
What's that?
The questions I asked were to diagnose dementia.
But I'm only 27.
How could I be going senile?
It's possible.
So...
What's going to happen to me?
A mental death will come before a physical one.
Better prepare yourself for what's inevitable.
Medicine can slow it down.
But that's about it.
What about surgery?
Do you work?
Yes.
You should quit right away.
Soon you won't be able to type or answer the phone... let alone organize things.
Pretty much nothing.
You will forget your family, friends and even yourself.
All your memories will disappear completely.
Should I quit my job?
Why?
Why don't I stay home and do the chores?
Sure, I'd like that.
Why suddenly?
I don't know.
Tired of working?
It's dog-eat-dog out there I'll bring home the bread and milk.
Quit right away.
Maybe I'll quit tomorrow?
Hold on.
What's going on?
Do you want a baby?
A baby?
I don't know.
Never thought about it.
Do it for me.
What?
That.
What?
That...
You mean... in-and-out?
No, that thing you do with cards.
Grift?
You never win.
Just once.
No, I'm tired.
Please just once.
You're not saying it?
Place your bets.
Even a dog at a glance can win.
Su-jin wins bread money.
Chul-soo wins cigarette money.
Double up your money.
Don't let your luck slip by...
The luck is right in your hands.
Pick an Ace!
An Ace!
You win.
Won't you be bored?
No.
Hello?
Young-min here.
How could you quit without notice?
If it's me let's meet and talk.
No.
I'm not hitting on you!
- I just...
- You want to quit, then follow the rule!
- I just want to stay home.
- What's wrong with you!
If you don't feel comfortable with me we can meet with other colleagues.
I'll come to the office.
- Here you go.
- Give me one of those
You packed a lunch?
How nice!
The color is so tacky!
Let's see what you have.
Rice!
Looks so good!
What about side dishes?
Is that for me?
You shouldn't have!
Maybe... you've confused her with someone else with the same name?
Or the wrong documents...
Hands off!
You won't understand it anyway!
It's your wife.
Are you crazy?
You okay, Ma'am?
Why the hell did you tell her everything?
Why the hell did you tell her everything?
I am a doctor.
She needs time to prepare for what's coming.
- You sure about this?
- Of course!
Positive?
If you don't believe me, take her to another doctor.
Doctor!
Are you sure!
You crazy?
What's wrong with you?
- Are you sure?
- This is a hospital!
Are you sure?
Calm down, sir!
His wife died from it, too.
He's spent half of his life researching Alzheimer's.
Accept what's real.
You can't change it
Are you alright?
Do you need to see a doctor?
Just little bit more...
Where are you going?
- I have no idea.
- Excuse me?
I don't believe it.
They are cloning human-beings nowadays.
There must be a cure for this.
I understand.
But your wife is a rare case.
Her symptoms are very close to my wife's.
It's an old story...
Before my wife died...
I took her to the place we first met.
Incredibly, she remembered almost everything then.
I was just so happy that I couldn't hold back my tears.
I thought things were coming back to her.
I was so happy.
And about 3 hours later.
She looked at me and said...
Who are you?
Why are you crying so?
That's what she said.
Hah, that's a mystery of human brains, isn't it?
I'm telling you this from my own experience.
You can't find it in books.
- Hello?
- Who's this?
I found this cell phone on the street.
What happened?
What happened to her?
That's...
How can I explain this?
Young-min.
Can we go back to...
two years ago?
Two years ago?
What for?
That's even before we met.
What?
What are you thinking about?
Su-jin!
Fool.
Keep your eye on the ball.
It's strange.
I only got 9 balls.
It's actually 10, right?
Isn't it?
Did you find out?
What?
That I have an eraser in my head.
- Let's part ways.
- What?
You were right.
One can't be happy forever.
- What are you talking about?
- It's all over.
Think about it.
What's love good for if my memory is gone?
Don't be so nice to me.
I'll forget everything.
I'll remember everything for you.
You know I'm smart.
I passed the architect test on the first try.
You're too confident.
Life can be very cruel.
You didn't forget that.
How could I?
You're mean.
Don't worry.
There'll be a cure...
You crybaby!
Have you lost your parents or your country?
I'll just leave.
Please let me go, okay?
Want to have a go?
Want to bet on it?
Damn!
Why are you crying?
I said I'd remember everything for you!
You know what?
If you forget everything I will pop up out of nowhere.
Like this.
And I'll hit on you.
You won't be able to turn me down.
We'll start afresh every day.
Like permanent dating.
Awesome, isn't it?
You're going to grow a goatee again?
Don't bother.
Let's forget everything while we're happy.
I'll forget everything soon.
I won't know why you're with me.
You'll be gone out of my head.
And so will I.
You understand that?
As my memory disappears my soul will disappear too.
I'm scared!
Why would your soul disappear?
Get up.
Leave it to me.
I'm your memory.

One at a time!
She doesn't recognize me anymore.
She doesn't?
I know how that feels but don't let it eat you up.
It's the recent memories that disappear first.
That's what Alzheimer's does.
No point in blaming the patient.
Looking straight into my eyes...
She calls me by the name of her ex-lover.
And she says I love you.
Who does she really love?
She misses those days.
Right?
That's just what remains in her memory.
You received her love, not me.
Ask yourself.
What the hell are you talking about?
You got us redo this three times already.
Now that you're in suits want to have fun with your wife?
While we finish up all this?
Damn, let's talk sense here, man.
Chil-bok, I...
Who am I?
What?
Am I that bad?
What's wrong?
Hey, Chul-soo Great job, isn't it?
- Chul-soo!
- Chul-soo...
Chul-soo!
How to read time.
Su-jin, Chul-soo
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I never meant to break your heart.
God, what have I done?
Are you crying now?
I didn't want to see you crying or in pain.
I wanted to make you happy.
But all I've done is put you in agony.
Chul-soo!
Oh my love Chul-soo.
Don't get me wrong.
I only love you and only you.
I only think of you.
I only remember you.
How badly do I wish to show you my heart!
Is there any way I can do that while my memory remains?
Oh, my heart races.
I, Kim Su-jin love you Choi Chul-soo, only.
I don't want to forget that.
And I must not.
Can you see that?
Can you feel my heart?
I'm afraid my just-returned memory will leave me again before I tell you everything I have to say.
I love you.
And I'm sorry.
I met you because I was forgetful.
I'm leaving you because I'm forgetful.
You were the best thing that ever happened to me.
How thankful I am to God for having sent you as gift to me.
I don't have to remember you.
You're a part of me.
I smile, laugh, and smell like you do.
I might forget you, but nothing can drive you out of my body.
Although you've never told me you loved me...
I know deep in my heart that you love me.
Forgive me for leaving you.
Please...
For the last time I have a favor to ask.
Please see my father.

You've had a hard time ever since you were born.
That miserable pain of the past... is about to bring you a fortune.
And you are blowing it away?
Does it make sense?
Go!
Go back to work!
Man, Su-jin...
Do you know the saying...
Forgiving is just giving your hate a little room in your heart?
She's given me a lot.
I have something to tell her...
before she forgets me completely.
If I don't... my life will be meaningless.
Missing Person

As you've heard, this was shot by the dashboard camera in Officer Logan's squad car.
I wanted you to see it again before you begin deliberations.
The defendant's car.
Darryl Ainsworth got out because he was trying to keep Officer Logan from seeing the cocaine that was in plain view inside.
Mister Ainsworth didn't want to go back to prison for the third time.
That was his motive for killing Officer Logan.
Jake Logan was thirty-one years old, an eight-year veteran of the Boston Police Department.
He had four commendations for heroism.
He divided his off-duty time between the Police Athletic League and helping his father with the family business.
When the police caught up with Ainsworth the next day, he was attempting to flee the jurisdiction.
Officer Logan's blood was on the clothes that he'd worn that night.
A decade ago, based on the evidence that you have seen, a jury convicted the defendant of this senseless murder.
The conviction was overturned on a technical point.
I tried that case then.
I'm trying it now.
And I will be here in ten year's time if that is what I have to do to keep this man behind bars.
Because this man, as the evidence i narguably demonstrates, killed Officer Jake Logan in cold blood.
I know, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, all of you will do the right thing.
Nine-one-one from my office.
Can we have an early dinner instead of lunch?
Sure.
Can I have my employee back soon?
The last jury convicted Ainsworth in ten minutes, and half of that was spent selecting a foreman.
You'll have her back in an hour, tops.
Why you allowed Jordan on a jury--
By the time they brought her in, I'd used up all my peremptory challenges.
Believe me, if I'd know she was waiting in the wings, I'd have saved one.
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
This case is a slam dunk.
Even Jordan Cavanaugh can't derail it.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC:2004/03/12
Well?
We've been here less than ten minutes, Mister Webb.
I don't think we need to rush Doctor Cavanaugh.
But it's an open and shut case.
Well, yeah, uh, but there's one thing that- that kind of bothers me.
Well, uh, the evidence couldn't be more clear-cut.
It's the wound in Officer Logan's chest.
- The entrance wound.
- Yeah.
What about it?
Nothing personal.
So?
So, according to the prosecution's case--
Officer Logan and Ainsworth slid down the incline, grabbing and punching at each other.
Logan managed to sock Ainsworth, but he couldn't get to his gun in time.
And Ainsworth...fired his weapon at Logan from a distance of about eighteen inches.
Do you have a point?
If that's the way it happened, there should have been tattooing around the bullet hole, uh, gun powder embedded in the skin.
Why wasn't it there?
He had on a police issue jacket.
Open in the front.
Well, maybe they were farther apart than eighteen inches.
No, the shoe prints say they weren't.
The crime scene investigators were definite about where the two men were standing at the time of the shooting.
They don't make a lot of mistakes.
So what?
There's nobody else who could have done it.
There weren't any other shoeprints.
Just the cop's and the defendant's.
But there were no other bare spots that would take prints.
I mean, the guy's guilty.
Even if you were to pick away every detail of the prosecution's case,
I mean, you just can't get around that.
Ainsworth was a two-time loser.
There were drugs in his car.
Everything except the actual shooting was caught on tape.
I'm not saying that Ainsworth didn't do it.
Maybe he did.
But there are some anomalies here we need to discuss.
What'll it take to put your mind at ease?
I'd really like to take a look at a copy of the autopsy report.
It was entered into evidence.
Uh, we can ask the judge to see it.
Then I guess that's what we'll have to do.
- You're welcome, sir.
- Nice tie.
Festive, like you.
Do you have to go back to your office tonight?
No, do you?
Certain inducements might keep me away from my desk for a while?
How long a while?
Depends on the inducement.
I have one that might qualify.
Like to hear about it in detail.
Well, first--
My office.
Don't do it.
I have to.
The jury may be in.
Yes?
Did they say why they wanted it?
Alright, thanks for letting me know.
The jury sent a note to the judge asking for the autopsy report.
And I was wondering what was taking them so long.
Now I know.
Well, it could have been somebody other than Jordan.
She just can't help herself, can she?
Has to keep everything stirred up.
Has to stick her thumb in my eye one more time.
I'm sure everybody on the jury knows the original conviction was overturned.
And they all know why.
The sound card from the dashboard camera got misplaced before the first trial.
Why the First Circuit thought that warranted a reversal--
Jordan doesn't do things for the hell of it, Renee.
Whatever her reason is,
I'm sure it has nothing to do with wanting to screw up your case.
Yeah, well, the results are the same.
A live grenade in the jury room.
You know you're the D.A.
Should have more faith in the system.
Cheers.
Nineteen ninety-four?
Gee, Garret, you run out of cases from the present?
I'm a dedicated public servant.
Oh, then you'll be eager to sign the massive stack of authorizations
- I left on your desk.
- Hmm.
My enthusiasm's barely containable.
Aren't you going home now?
Apparently not.
Oh, I know this seems like overkill, right?
So to speak.
What we have here is a bunch of morons who demonstrate heir faith in some seriously weird god by allowing themselves to be bitten by rattlesnakes.
Uh, don't know where they get the rattlesnakes from.
I'm not making this up, either.
Hey, shouldn't Jordan be back by now?
I'll suit up and help you.
And, Peter, I know you're pulling double duty, but no more coffee, alright?
- See ya.
- Uh-huh.
Does this mean you've reached a verdict?
Oh, no, no.
We just broke for the day.
I thought I'd drop by and see if I could help out.
Good, you can give Peter a hand in Trace.
Oh, and Jordan, why did you want to see the autopsy report on Officer Logan?
I can't discuss the case.
Sorry, it's the rules.
Rules?
Who am I talkin' to?
I took an oath, Garret.
Now, maybe that doesn't mean anything to you.
Doctor McCain was kind of a hack, but I'm not seeing anything glaringly bad.
`Course, I'm only on page two.
Don't take this the wrong way, but uh, what does it have to do with you?
Is there really something wrong with this case, or are you just kicking up dust for the hell of it?
Ah, Walcott wondering what's taking so long?
The evidence is overwhelming.
Then she's got nothing to worry about.
And she doesn't need you running interference for her.
I don't need this.
It's all in my autopsy report.
Your report contains some ambiguities, Doctor McCain.
And that's the nice way of puttin' it.
It's not enough that you fired me when you took over.
Now you bring me back to insult me.
Okay, ready when you are, chaps.
I can't tell which the entrance wound.
The one in his chest.
Well, look, th- there's no tattooing.
Both of `em are oval.
Red rim abrasions in both of `em.
No torn skin margins, neither one, and both exhibit microtears at the edges.
You're gonna have to explain to me how you knew which was which.
The shoeprints at the crime scene showed that the shooter was standing in front of the victim.
Explain it to me forensically.
You know how hard it can be to tell entrance from exit with a small caliber shooting.
You testified twice that you knew.
Back when Doctor Blackledge ran this place, we worked with the cops and the D.A.'s Office.
Sure, we used to call him Doctor Choo-Choo because he railroaded so many defendants with predetermined outcomes.
Was this one of those cases?
You're a self-righteous jerk, Macy.
And it was nothing that I did that got the conviction overturned.
It was the prosecutor who lost the sound card.
What prosecutor?
The one who tried the case-- Renee Walcott.
You got a problem, talk to her.
- What's going on, Doctor Macy?
- I'm not sure.
I want to see the body.
And what's it gonna tell you after all this time?
A lot more than this piece of crap.
All I'm saying is that the autopsy was written as though the results were a foregone conclusion.
And so they were.
You can't even tell which was the entrance wound.
Who cares?
Cops blood on Ainsworth's clothes.
One mysteriously missing thirty-two caliber murder weapon, a compelling motive, drug-addled brain and-- oh, yes--the videotape.
Where was the gun?
Now, it wasn't Officer Logan's gun.
Where was it?
We are never gonna get outa here, are we?
Okay, the videotape.
Ainsworth worth gets out of the car.
He's wearing jeans and a T-shirt.
He's not holding a gun.
Wasn't in his waistband.
Could have been here.
Pretty uncomfortable way to drive.
Are you as crazy as she is?
Guy had to have a gun on him somewhere, because he shot the cop.
Did he?
Uh, isn't that what we're here to decide?
Just because we didn't see a gun doesn't mean there wasn't one, Doctor Cavanaugh.
There is really no other explanation for what happened that night.
So we just ignore the defendant's testimony?
/ Of all the--
That guy came up with the stupidest excuse I ever heard.
Do we really have to waste our time discussing that lie?
What did you think about what the defendant said?
Well, I guess it was the best he could do under the circumstances.
He said he got knocked out and doesn't know what happened after that.
I woke up and somebody had shot him.
It wasn't me.
I didn't even have a gun.
Lame, pathetic, pitiful.
Someone else did it while he was knocked out.
Gimme a break.
You saw his booking photo from two days after the murder.
The force behind that was plenty to knock somebody out.
Maybe they both got knocked out.
And the defendant came to first and shot the cop.
Uh, no, there was no bruising on the officer, and he was standing when he was shot.
Why do you want to exhume Jake's body?
There are some lingering forensic issues.
Is there something wrong with the case?
Well, the District Attorney seems to be worried.
Uh, it's very rare for a judge to halt jury deliberations to consider new evidence to consider new evidence, but it can happen.
I don't want you to dig him up.
It's not right after all these years.
Is there any chance that our son's killer could be a acquitted?
You never know with juries.
I wouldn't ask if I didn't think it was important.
You decide.
Jake was a huge help to my husband in his business.
Custom carpentry.
He used to get off his shift and go straight to his dad's shop.
Please don't let Jake's killer go free.
You're positing the existence of a third party, who just happened to be there, just happened to want the officer dead, just happened to have a gun and just happened to get lucky.
I'd like to have a gun right now.
Any more talk like that, Mister Webb, and I'll send a note to the judge requesting your removal.
For what?
Standing up to a lunatic?
We'll have another voice vote.
- Guilty. / Guilty.
- Guilty. / Guilty. / Guilty.
Not guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Not guilty.
Guilty.
Not guilty.
Congratulations.
You've converted two morons.
Is this normal?
I mean, after ten years?
He was buried at the top of the slope.
Moisture drained away.
Alright, we got red rim abrasions at nine o'clock on this wound and at three o'clock on the wound in his back.
So that means the shooter was farther away than everybody says.
Maybe.
Close up, the abrasions should be in the same position, both entrance and exit wounds.
Read to me what it says about the path of the bullet.
Okay,
"The bullet entered through the chest, ripped through the intercostals, perforated the upper lobe of the left lung and then exited out the back.
- Didn't hit a single bone.
- Does that matter?
With bone fracture, you can determine the direction of the bullet.
All I have are muscle tears, which tell me nothing.
Alright, close him up.
You got the crime scene report in that stack of stuff?
Yeah.
Here.
Detective Al Morris was first to arrive at the scene.
Was he now?
So why didn't he testify at either trial?
Eh, I'm looking for Detective Hoyt.
Is he on duty?
Well, can you track him down and ask him to call me at the morgue?
Okay, thanks.
Yeah?
Mister and Mrs. Logan came to my office.
They wanted to know what's going on.
I had no idea what they were talking about.
Should I send you a memo every time I make a decision?
You lied to them.
You told them I wanted you to exhume their son's body.
No, they made that assumption.
Based on what you said or left out.
What did you leave out?
I beg your pardon?
What happened to that sound card?
I told you, it got misplaced.
You didn't tell me it was in your possession at the time.
Garret, it was lost.
I wish it hadn't been.
Why didn't you call Detective Morris as a witness in either trial?
There's no conspiracy here.
I didn't say there was.
Dig up all the bodies you want, you'll come to same conclusion that I did.
However, by asking for your help,
Doctor Cavanaugh violated her oath as a juror.
She did not discuss this case with me.
And I do not intend to let it slide.
You've had your claws out for Jordan ever since you walked in here, haven't you?
My claws.
I just don't like her, because she's a loose cannon and because you allow her to rub your face in the mud.
And what?
That's supposed to be your job?
Macy.
He was the first cop on the scene and he didn't testify?
Yeah, is that normal?
It's the D.A.'s call.
Maybe the guy's a bad witness.
I've known a lot of cops who freeze up on the stand.
But he was there seven minutes before anybody else.
Okay, I'll admit it's a little weird, but it doesn't mean there's some big cover-up goin' on.
- You think the guy on trial didn't do it?
- I don't think anything.
I just want you to ask Detective Morris why he didn't testify.
Why don't you ask him?
Because you're a cop.
He'll feel more comfortable with you.
What, he's gonna tell me things he's not gonna tell you, then I betray his confidence.
Is that what you're thinkin'?
I'm thinking you'll do the right thing, Woody.
It's kinda who you are.
Alright, don't slather it on.
I'll talk to Detective Morris, but I will not do anything to help a cop killer walk.
Good.
Neither will I.
You gotta remember, the cops caught up with him at a bus station.
He was on his way out of town, and flight is an indication of guilt.
Or fear.
Yeah, it doesn't tell us anything.
He'd run whether he did it or not.
- The exhibits you asked for.
- Thank you.
Thanks.
So what's this gonna tell us?
We know it was Officer Logan's blood on the defendant's clothes.
If Ainsworth was lying on the ground unconscious when the cop was shot-- okay, right here.
See how most of the blood is on the left side.
If Ainsworth was lying on his right side, this is what we'd expect to see.
Is that the only way that can happen?
I mean... what if he was standing a little bit off to the side when he pulled the trigger?
Maybe.
Except the bullet's path through the body was dead straight.
Are you saying the splatter pattern corroborates the defendant's story?
It tends to corroborate it.
Which one of you is juror number twelve?
That would be me.
Judge Marshall wants to see you in his chambers.
The rest of you are not to discuss the case until juror twelve returns.
Doctor Cavanaugh, you've been accused of violating the oath you took as a juror.
No, not unless you changed it between then and now.
Do you have any idea how serious this is?
I have a feeling you're about to explain it to me.
Your Honor, a day after the jury requested the autopsy report,
Doctor Macy had Mister Logan's body exhumed.
Obviously, Doctor Cavanaugh asked him to look into the case.
That's not true.
Did you speak to Doctor Cavanaugh about this case?
I did.
She said she couldn't talk about it.
Why did you have Mister Logan's body dug up?
I read the original autopsy report, and it raised some questions that I thought deserved further scrutiny?
Did you find anything probative or exculpatory?
I found more questions.
For me to give you what you'd want,
I'd have to brand the Chief Medical Examiner a liar.
Absent proof, I'm not inclined to do that. / Nor am I.
She could have talked one of her coworkers into stimulating Doctor Macy's curiosity.
I see you don't mind calling me a liar.
Have you spoken to anyone about this case.
Yes.
The eleven other people in the jury room.
That's it.
Mister Collins?
I have no problem with Doctor Cavanaugh.
I'd need more than your personal opinion about what might have happened, Ms. Walcott.
I will not reconstitute the jury at this point.
Then I ask that you sequester them for the remainder of deliberations.
That I will do.
And I think I'll let you have the honor of telling your fellow jurors.
Sequestered?
You're kidding?
- Hey, don't look at me.
- I'm gonna lose my job--
Sooner we focus, the sooner we can get out of here.
Focus on what?
More minutiae?
We're missing the forest for the trees.
Amen, sister.
The videotape is the forest.
No matter what you do, you can't get around that.
I'm not trying to get around anything.
I just want the anomalies explained.
Well, we don't have enough information to do that.
Then how can we be expected to make a decision?
Since the discrepancies can't be resolved in this room, are you likely to change your vote?
No.
Common ground at last!
Me, neither.
Normal people call and talk.
They don't drag each other in front of a judge.
Normal people aren't responsible for the administration of justice.
I told you Jordan said nothing to me about this case.
- Have I ever lied to you, Renee?
- Not that I know of.
Don't you think you would know?
Someone as prickly as you are would figure it out in a hurry.
Prickly?
Look, at some point, you just have to jump in the water and trust you'll be okay.
Oh, didja get that off a mug?
Okay, then.
You Hoyt?
Ah, Detective Morris.
Thank you for comin' down.
Have a seat.
What'll you have?
Whatever's on tap.
- Boss, a beer, please.
- Sure thing.
Thanks.
There you go.
So what's this about?
Uh, I just thought we could talk.
You didn't bring me down here to tell war stories, did you?
No, no.
The Chief M.E. was wondering why you didn't testify in the Jake Logan trials.
I heard he dug Jake up.
What's he doin'?
I'm not sure, but I told him if he wants to mess the case up, he should not count on me.
Well, I was on an extradition pick-up in Utah for the first trial, in the hospital for the second.
Shoulder surgery.
Could have gotten a sub to do that pick-up.
I didn't want to testify.
I sort of left something out my report.
The twenty grand I found in the trunk of Logan's squad car.
Hey, he wasn't on the take.
Liked to gamble.
Sometimes he won big.
It would have just muddied the issues.
You would have done the same thing.
Well, what happened to the money?
I gave it to his father.
Prosecutor never heard about this?
No, why would I tell her?
It had nothing to do with the murder.
Hey, you don't have to convince me.
So there wasn't anything nefarious goin' on.
The guy just wasn't available to testify either time.
It's not like Walcott needed him.
Yeah?
Yeah, I see him.
No-no, it's okay.
Mister Logan.
The District Attorney didn't ask you to look into anything.
You lied to us.
- Who are you.
- Detective Hoyt.
You're a cop.
You're helping him.
If you'll have a seat, I'll try to explain.
I can listen standing up.
The original autopsy performed on your son was unprofessional.
- Were you there?
- No, I pulled the report and I read it.
Why?
- I want an answer, Macy.
- I was curious.
And what sparked your curiosity?
Mister Logan, I understand why you're upset, but sometimes-
Can I get a straight answer out of you?
No, sir.
I don't have an answer.
If that piece of garbage that killed my son gets off because of you, you need to watch your back.
Sir, I understand that you're angry, but that's no reason to threaten people.
You heard me.
You heard me.
What are you doing this for?
- Ready when you are, Doctor M.
- Now what?
- The tape from the dashboard camera.
- What for?
It was just accepted as is.
It was never even enhanced.
Doctor Macy, you've got to tell me the truth.
I'm beginning to think that Ainsworth is innocent, okay?
Let's go.
Two days and you think you're deadlocked.
What's the split?
Just the numbers, please.
Last vote, nine to three.
Then you're three votes from success.
Your Honor, we won't ever reach a verdict because that crazy lady right there will never convince me to vote not guilty.
That's enough, sir.
- Uh, may I say something, Your Honor?
- Is it more name calling?
No, sir.
Uh, there's just so much insufficient information in this case.
We can't reach any logical conclusions.
Stop right there, Doctor Cavanaugh.
We all saw the same evidence, and there's no way you can sell me that position.
There's also no way I will declare a mistrial after only two days.
You will return to the jury room and you will stay there until you reach a verdict.
Is that as clear as you can get it?
Lord, no.
Now, it would help if I knew what you were looking for.
What's that right there?
In the mirror?
It's another video artifact, probably.
- Can you get the two men clearer?
- Yeah.
Morris say anything else?
Found a big a wad of cash from Logan's trunk.
Morris didn't put it in his report.
- Dirty cop?
- No, a gambler.
I spoke to some of the other guys who said he was a stand-up guy and a great cop.
Yeah, with a gambling problem.
Gentlemen.
Stop the tape.
What is that?
That shadow right there.
Well, perhaps it's just a shadow.
We convert to frequency domain.
Enhance the spike.
Or perhaps a gun.
Ainsworth testified he wasn't carrying that night.
You still think the son of a bitch is innocent?
You still think Ainsworth didn't do it?
I never said that.
So you'll tell the judge?
What for.
If this were exculpatory, he could halt deliberations, but not for this.
I've had my turn.
Police report says the D.A.'s investigator spent a couple days looking for the gun ten years ago, but the cops don't have a copy of his search grid.
Now you're gonna prove my case for me?
What happened to "Jordan has a reason for everything she does"?
If that jury hangs and you have to try Ainsworth a third time, you're gonna thank me for finding that gun.
If you do.
Guilty.
Not guilty.
Guilty.
Not guilty.
Guilty.
Not guilty.
Not guilty.
Nine not guilty.
Did any of you change your vote just because you want to get out of here
- and go home?
/ They all did.
- I didn't.
Aw, bull.
You know what?
It's not gonna do you any good.
Rest of you can whine as much as you want, because Rosenblatt, Harris and I are standin' firm.
This is the crime scene, and this is the fleabag hotel where Ainsworth was living.
- Overlay the police search grid.
- Mm-hm.
Looks like they covered every square inch between the two.
Guy from the D.A.'s Office?
Hansen's Dry Creek Bed.
Is it always dry?
Mmm, depends on the rainfall.
Cops checked the creek.
Not past here.
Where does it go?
Feeds down into Scarboro Pond, south end of the park.
I take it the pond was never dredged.
That's the problem with airtight cases.
Everybody gets overconfident.
You know, you might not need to call out the dredging crew.
Yeah, before it gets to the pond, it has to pass through here.
City must clean it out sometimes.
That's not ten years worth of debris.
Gun can't still be here.
If somebody found it, they would have turned it in.
Probably sank in the mud.
Nigel, get in there?
- The- these are new shoes.
- Take `em off.
Gimme this thing.
I got this.
Man, it is nasty back here.
Alright.
I got a belt buckle.
I got some needle-nosed pliers.
I got
- I don't know what that is.
And
a thirty-two.
Clear.
It's Jordan, isn't it?
This trial would be over by now if she wasn't in there poking' holes in everything.
That'd be my guess.
Jordan being Jordan, guilty man's gonna go free.
You may need to rephrase that, Woody.
The striations are completely different.
They can't be.
It's Ainsworth's gun.
The serial numbers match.
Yeah, but the bullets don't.
This gun did not fire the fatal shot.
I don't know whether Ainsworth did it or not.
That's the whole point.
There's no category for innocent.
There's just guilty and not guilty, and if the evidence doesn't add up beyond a reasonable doubt, we have to vote not guilty regardless of how we feel about it.
Mister Rosenblatt?
When you put it that way, not guilty.
Well, that just leaves you and Richard.
I just can't get around the videotape.
If the tape didn't exist, how would you vote?
But it does exist.
All it tells us is that both men were there that night.
Everything else is discrepancy piled on anomaly.
The bottom line is the guy, Ainsworth.
Did you look at him?
Did you see what he is?
An addict, a loser, scum.
I didn't hear anything in the judge's instructions about convicting based on character.
Alright, I'm changing my vote.
Not guilty.
I was a cop for almost twenty years.
All day, every day I dealt with people like Darryl Ainsworth.
You're a doctor.
What do you know about the mean streets?
Almost twenty years?
Why almost?
What are you gettin' at?
Well, you get a full pension at twenty years.
Why didn't you stick around for it?
Maybe one too many brutality complaints?
Kick in the wrong door once too often?
Or-- oh, and I
- I like this one-- you buffed your reports to make sure that the scum got locked up, whether they were guilty or not.
Here it is.
Your last chance to play God.
You do realize this doesn't exonerate Ainsworth.
He could have been carrying a different gun that night.
If you don't show this to the judge, I will.
Oh, I'll show him.
If I can get him to call a mistrial, I can start over with a new jury.
I think he'd start over with a new investigation.
Alex, find Judge Marshall and tell him I need to see him urgently.
Alright, I'm
- I'm on my way.
The jury's reached a verdict.
- Doctor Macy.
- It'll have to wait, Nigel.
- No-no, this one can't.
- What is it?
!
Alright, that blur on the videotape, you know, the one that I thought was a video artifact.
I enhanced it.
You're not gonna believe what I found.
Come.
Has the jury reached a verdict?
Yes, Your Honor.
As to the sole count of the indictment, murder in the first degree, we find the defendant, Darryl Cole Ainsworth, not guilty.
-- so much.
-- the testimony.
He didn't know what the hell was goin'on.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, thank you for your service to the court.
You are excused.
The judge have something to say to us?
Please have a seat.
My office enhanced the video from your son's patrol car.
I think you know what we found.
What are you talking about?
Mister Logan?
There was a third car.
We got the license plate number.
It was your car.
Carl, what- what's going on?
Okay, then I'll tell you what we think happened.
You can correct me at any time.
Jake was stealing money from your business to pay for his gambling habit.
He wouldn't admit he had a problem and you couldn't stop him, so you decided to follow him to see what he was doing with the money.
I'm giving you...the benefit of the doubt here, assuming you didn't set out to kill him.
With him being a cop, an unexpected opportunity arose.
Way for you to make all your problems go away.
You stopped Darryl Ainsworth for a broken taillight.
When he and Ainsworth started fighting... you found yourself in the perfect situation.
Dad?
What are you doin'?
See, we prefer to think that...you just happened to have a gun in your car, and desperation pushed you over the edge.
Carl?
I spent my whole life building up my business.
I just couldn't make him stop.
Mr. Logan, you should speak with an attorney before you say anything else.
Nice to know I didn't help get a killer off.
Yeah, it's nice to know the system works.
The system needs a serious overhaul.
Jordan, the next time you're called for jury duty, let your shrink know.
I'm sure there's a reason you should be excused.
Wow, did you mean to call me a nut job or are you just crabby?
Okay, crabby it is.
But I've got something to cheer you up.
Ballpoint pen through the eye, autopsy two.
I know you love those ballpoint pen cases.
Hi, Renee.
Garret.
Well, movin' on.
Uh, before you go, thank you.
Okay, what for?
It can't have been easy standing up by yourself in there.
You did a good thing.
Well, thanks.
Why?
What made you doubt the case so much?
I didn't in the beginning.
I just thought uh, well, nobody else wanted to talk about it.
It seemed to me that was the whole reason we were there.
Okay, good.
Um, I came by to tell you.
I don't know how to swim.
It's never too late to learn.
Well, maybe not tonight since you're busy.
With what?
With the ballpoint pen thing with Jordan.
Well, don't you think this is more important?
Do you?
Are you always gonna be this challenging?
Isn't that what you like about me?
As you've heard, this was shot by the dashboard camera in Officer Logan's squad car.
I wanted you to see it again before you begin deliberations.
The defendant's car.
Darryl Ainsworth got out because he was trying to keep Officer Logan from seeing the cocaine that was in plain view inside.
Mister Ainsworth didn't want to go back to prison for the third time.
That was his motive for killing Officer Logan.
Jake Logan was thirty-one years old, an eight-year veteran of the Boston Police Department.
He had four commendations for heroism.
He divided his off-duty time between the Police Athletic League and helping his father with the family business.
When the police caught up with Ainsworth the next day, he was attempting to flee the jurisdiction.
Officer Logan's blood was on the clothes that he'd worn that night.
A decade ago, based on the evidence that you have seen, a jury convicted the defendant of this senseless murder.
The conviction was overturned on a technical point.
I tried that case then.
I'm trying it now.
And I will be here in ten year's time if that is what I have to do to keep this man behind bars.
Because this man, as the evidence i narguably demonstrates, killed Officer Jake Logan in cold blood.
I know, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, all of you will do the right thing.
Nine-one-one from my office.
Can we have an early dinner instead of lunch?
Sure.
Can I have my employee back soon?
The last jury convicted Ainsworth in ten minutes, and half of that was spent selecting a foreman.
You'll have her back in an hour, tops.
Why you allowed Jordan on a jury-
By the time they brought her in, I'd used up all my peremptory challenges.
Believe me, if I'd know she was waiting in the wings, I'd have saved one.
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
This case is a slam dunk.
Even Jordan Cavanaugh can't derail it.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
CROSSING JORDAN 3x02 Slam Dunk
Well?
We've been here less than ten minutes, Mister Webb.
I don't think we need to rush Doctor Cavanaugh.
But it's an open and shut case.
Well, yeah, uh, but there's one thing that- that kind of bothers me.
Well, uh, the evidence couldn't be more clear-cut.
It's the wound in Officer Logan's chest.
- The entrance wound.
- Yeah.
What about it?
Nothing personal.
So?
So, according to the prosecution's case-
Officer Logan and Ainsworth slid down the incline, grabbing and punching at each other.
Logan managed to sock Ainsworth, but he couldn't get to his gun in time.
And Ainsworth... fired his weapon at Logan from a distance of about eighteen inches.
Do you have a point?
If that's the way it happened, there should have been tattooing around the bullet hole, uh, gun powder embedded in the skin.
Why wasn't it there?
He had on a police issue jacket.
Open in the front.
Well, maybe they were farther apart than eighteen inches.
No, the shoe prints say they weren't.
The crime scene investigators were definite about where the two men were standing at the time of the shooting.
They don't make a lot of mistakes.
So what?
There's nobody else who could have done it.
There weren't any other shoeprints.
Just the cop's and the defendant's.
But there were no other bare spots that would take prints.
I mean, the guy's guilty.
Even if you were to pick away every detail of the prosecution's case,
I mean, you just can't get around that.
Ainsworth was a two-time loser.
There were drugs in his car.
Everything except the actual shooting was caught on tape.
I'm not saying that Ainsworth didn't do it.
Maybe he did.
But there are some anomalies here we need to discuss.
What'll it take to put your mind at ease?
I'd really like to take a look at a copy of the autopsy report.
It was entered into evidence.
Uh, we can ask the judge to see it.
Then I guess that's what we'll have to do.
- You're welcome, sir.
- Nice tie.
Festive, like you.
Do you have to go back to your office tonight?
No, do you?
Certain inducements might keep me away from my desk for a while?
How long a while?
Depends on the inducement.
I have one that might qualify.
Like to hear about it in detail.
Well, first-
My office.
Don't do it.
I have to.
The jury may be in.
Yes?
Did they say why they wanted it?
Alright, thanks for letting me know.
The jury sent a note to the judge asking for the autopsy report.
And I was wondering what was taking them so long.
Now I know.
Well, it could have been somebody other than Jordan.
She just can't help herself, can she?
Has to keep everything stirred up.
Has to stick her thumb in my eye one more time.
I'm sure everybody on the jury knows the original conviction was overturned.
And they all know why.
The sound card from the dashboard camera got misplaced before the first trial.
Why the First Circuit thought that warranted a reversal-
Jordan doesn't do things for the hell of it, Renee.
Whatever her reason is,
I'm sure it has nothing to do with wanting to screw up your case.
Yeah, well, the results are the same.
A live grenade in the jury room.
You know you're the D.A.
Should have more faith in the system.
Cheers.
Nineteen ninety-four?
Gee, Garret, you run out of cases from the present?
I'm a dedicated public servant.
Oh, then you'll be eager to sign the massive stack of authorizations
- I left on your desk.
- Hmm.
My enthusiasm's barely containable.
Aren't you going home now?
Apparently not.
Oh, I know this seems like overkill, right?
So to speak.
What we have here is a bunch of morons who demonstrate heir faith in some seriously weird god by allowing themselves to be bitten by rattlesnakes.
Uh, don't know where they get the rattlesnakes from.
I'm not making this up, either.
Hey, shouldn't Jordan be back by now?
I'll suit up and help you.
And, Peter, I know you're pulling double duty, but no more coffee, alright?
- See ya.
- Uh-huh.
Does this mean you've reached a verdict?
Oh, no, no.
We just broke for the day.
I thought I'd drop by and see if I could help out.
Good, you can give Peter a hand in Trace.
Oh, and Jordan, why did you want to see the autopsy report on Officer Logan?
I can't discuss the case.
Sorry, it's the rules.
Rules?
Who am I talkin' to?
I took an oath, Garret.
Now, maybe that doesn't mean anything to you.
Doctor McCain was kind of a hack, but I'm not seeing anything glaringly bad.
Course, I'm only on page two.
Don't take this the wrong way, but uh, what does it have to do with you?
Is there really something wrong with this case, or are you just kicking up dust for the hell of it?
Ah, Walcott wondering what's taking so long?
The evidence is overwhelming.
Then she's got nothing to worry about.
And she doesn't need you running interference for her.
I don't need this.
It's all in my autopsy report.
Your report contains some ambiguities, Doctor McCain.
And that's the nice way of puttin' it.
It's not enough that you fired me when you took over.
Now you bring me back to insult me.
Okay, ready when you are, chaps.
I can't tell which the entrance wound.
The one in his chest.
Well, look, th- there's no tattooing.
Both of em are oval.
Red rim abrasions in both of eem.
No torn skin margins, neither one, and both exhibit microtears at the edges.
You're gonna have to explain to me how you knew which was which.
The shoeprints at the crime scene showed that the shooter was standing in front of the victim.
Explain it to me forensically.
You know how hard it can be to tell entrance from exit with a small caliber shooting.
You testified twice that you knew.
Back when Doctor Blackledge ran this place, we worked with the cops and the D.A.'s Office.
Sure, we used to call him Doctor Choo-Choo because he railroaded so many defendants with predetermined outcomes.
Was this one of those cases?
You're a self-righteous jerk, Macy.
And it was nothing that I did that got the conviction overturned.
It was the prosecutor who lost the sound card.
What prosecutor?
The one who tried the case- Renee Walcott.
You got a problem, talk to her.
- What's going on, Doctor Macy?
- I'm not sure.
I want to see the body.
And what's it gonna tell you after all this time?
A lot more than this piece of crap.
All I'm saying is that the autopsy was written as though the results were a foregone conclusion.
And so they were.
You can't even tell which was the entrance wound.
Who cares?
Cops blood on Ainsworth's clothes.
One mysteriously missing thirty-two caliber murder weapon, a compelling motive, drug-addled brain and- oh, yes-the videotape.
Where was the gun?
Now, it wasn't Officer Logan's gun.
Where was it?
We are never gonna get outa here, are we?
Okay, the videotape.
Ainsworth worth gets out of the car.
He's wearing jeans and a T-shirt.
He's not holding a gun.
Wasn't in his waistband.
Could have been here.
Pretty uncomfortable way to drive.
Are you as crazy as she is?
Guy had to have a gun on him somewhere, because he shot the cop.
Did he?
Uh, isn't that what we're here to decide?
Just because we didn't see a gun doesn't mean there wasn't one, Doctor Cavanaugh.
There is really no other explanation for what happened that night.
So we just ignore the defendant's testimony?
/ Of all the-
That guy came up with the stupidest excuse I ever heard.
Do we really have to waste our time discussing that lie?
What did you think about what the defendant said?
Well, I guess it was the best he could do under the circumstances.
He said he got knocked out and doesn't know what happened after that.
I woke up and somebody had shot him.
It wasn't me.
I didn't even have a gun.
Lame, pathetic, pitiful.
Someone else did it while he was knocked out.
Gimme a break.
You saw his booking photo from two days after the murder.
The force behind that was plenty to knock somebody out.
Maybe they both got knocked out.
And the defendant came to first and shot the cop.
Uh, no, there was no bruising on the officer, and he was standing when he was shot.
Why do you want to exhume Jake's body?
There are some lingering forensic issues.
Is there something wrong with the case?
Well, the District Attorney seems to be worried.
Uh, it's very rare for a judge to halt jury deliberations to consider new evidence to consider new evidence, but it can happen.
I don't want you to dig him up.
It's not right after all these years.
Is there any chance that our son's killer could be a acquitted?
You never know with juries.
I wouldn't ask if I didn't think it was important.
You decide.
Jake was a huge help to my husband in his business.
Custom carpentry.
He used to get off his shift and go straight to his dad's shop.
Please don't let Jake's killer go free.
You're positing the existence of a third party, who just happened to be there, just happened to want the officer dead, just happened to have a gun and just happened to get lucky.
I'd like to have a gun right now.
Any more talk like that, Mister Webb, and I'll send a note to the judge requesting your removal.
For what?
Standing up to a lunatic?
We'll have another voice vote.
- Guilty. / Guilty.
- Guilty. / Guilty. / Guilty.
Not guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Not guilty.
Guilty.
Not guilty.
Congratulations.
You've converted two morons.
Is this normal?
I mean, after ten years?
He was buried at the top of the slope.
Moisture drained away.
Alright, we got red rim abrasions at nine o'clock on this wound and at three o'clock on the wound in his back.
So that means the shooter was farther away than everybody says.
Maybe.
Close up, the abrasions should be in the same position, both entrance and exit wounds.
Read to me what it says about the path of the bullet.
Okay,
"The bullet entered through the chest, ripped through the intercostals, perforated the upper lobe of the left lung and then exited out the back.
- Didn't hit a single bone.
- Does that matter?
With bone fracture, you can determine the direction of the bullet.
All I have are muscle tears, which tell me nothing.
Alright, close him up.
You got the crime scene report in that stack of stuff?
Yeah.
Here.
Detective Al Morris was first to arrive at the scene.
Was he now?
So why didn't he testify at either trial?
Eh, I'm looking for Detective Hoyt.
Is he on duty?
Well, can you track him down and ask him to call me at the morgue?
Okay, thanks.
Yeah?
Mister and Mrs. Logan came to my office.
They wanted to know what's going on.
I had no idea what they were talking about.
Should I send you a memo every time I make a decision?
You lied to them.
You told them I wanted you to exhume their son's body.
No, they made that assumption.
Based on what you said or left out.
What did you leave out?
I beg your pardon?
What happened to that sound card?
I told you, it got misplaced.
You didn't tell me it was in your possession at the time.
Garret, it was lost.
I wish it hadn't been.
Why didn't you call Detective Morris as a witness in either trial?
There's no conspiracy here.
I didn't say there was.
Dig up all the bodies you want, you'll come to same conclusion that I did.
However, by asking for your help,
Doctor Cavanaugh violated her oath as a juror.
She did not discuss this case with me.
And I do not intend to let it slide.
You've had your claws out for Jordan ever since you walked in here, haven't you?
My claws.
I just don't like her, because she's a loose cannon and because you allow her to rub your face in the mud.
And what?
That's supposed to be your job?
Macy.
He was the first cop on the scene and he didn't testify?
Yeah, is that normal?
It's the D.A.'s call.
Maybe the guy's a bad witness.
I've known a lot of cops who freeze up on the stand.
But he was there seven minutes before anybody else.
Okay, I'll admit it's a little weird, but it doesn't mean there's some big cover-up goin' on.
- You think the guy on trial didn't do it?
- I don't think anything.
I just want you to ask Detective Morris why he didn't testify.
Why don't you ask him?
Because you're a cop.
He'll feel more comfortable with you.
What, he's gonna tell me things he's not gonna tell you, then I betray his confidence.
Is that what you're thinkin'?
I'm thinking you'll do the right thing, Woody.
It's kinda who you are.
Alright, don't slather it on.
I'll talk to Detective Morris, but I will not do anything to help a cop killer walk.
Good.
Neither will I.
You gotta remember, the cops caught up with him at a bus station.
He was on his way out of town, and flight is an indication of guilt.
Or fear.
Yeah, it doesn't tell us anything.
He'd run whether he did it or not.
- The exhibits you asked for.
- Thank you.
Thanks.
So what's this gonna tell us?
We know it was Officer Logan's blood on the defendant's clothes.
If Ainsworth was lying on the ground unconscious when the cop was shot- okay, right here.
See how most of the blood is on the left side.
If Ainsworth was lying on his right side, this is what we'd expect to see.
Is that the only way that can happen?
I mean... what if he was standing a little bit off to the side when he pulled the trigger?
Maybe.
Except the bullet's path through the body was dead straight.
Are you saying the splatter pattern corroborates the defendant's story?
It tends to corroborate it.
Which one of you is juror number twelve?
That would be me.
Judge Marshall wants to see you in his chambers.
The rest of you are not to discuss the case until juror twelve returns.
Doctor Cavanaugh, you've been accused of violating the oath you took as a juror.
No, not unless you changed it between then and now.
Do you have any idea how serious this is?
I have a feeling you're about to explain it to me.
Your Honor, a day after the jury requested the autopsy report,
Doctor Macy had Mister Logan's body exhumed.
Obviously, Doctor Cavanaugh asked him to look into the case.
That's not true.
Did you speak to Doctor Cavanaugh about this case?
I did.
She said she couldn't talk about it.
Why did you have Mister Logan's body dug up?
I read the original autopsy report, and it raised some questions that I thought deserved further scrutiny?
Did you find anything probative or exculpatory?
I found more questions.
For me to give you what you'd want,
I'd have to brand the Chief Medical Examiner a liar.
Absent proof, I'm not inclined to do that. / Nor am I.
She could have talked one of her coworkers into stimulating Doctor Macy's curiosity.
I see you don't mind calling me a liar.
Have you spoken to anyone about this case.
Yes.
The eleven other people in the jury room.
That's it.
Mister Collins?
I have no problem with Doctor Cavanaugh.
I'd need more than your personal opinion about what might have happened, Ms. Walcott.
I will not reconstitute the jury at this point.
Then I ask that you sequester them for the remainder of deliberations.
That I will do.
And I think I'll let you have the honor of telling your fellow jurors.
Sequestered?
You're kidding?
- Hey, don't look at me.
- I'm gonna lose my job-
Sooner we focus, the sooner we can get out of here.
Focus on what?
More minutiae?
We're missing the forest for the trees.
Amen, sister.
The videotape is the forest.
No matter what you do, you can't get around that.
I'm not trying to get around anything.
I just want the anomalies explained.
Well, we don't have enough information to do that.
Then how can we be expected to make a decision?
Since the discrepancies can't be resolved in this room, are you likely to change your vote?
No.
Common ground at last!
Me, neither.
Normal people call and talk.
They don't drag each other in front of a judge.
Normal people aren't responsible for the administration of justice.
I told you Jordan said nothing to me about this case.
- Have I ever lied to you, Renee?
- Not that I know of.
Don't you think you would know?
Someone as prickly as you are would figure it out in a hurry.
Prickly?
Look, at some point, you just have to jump in the water and trust you'll be okay.
Oh, didja get that off a mug?
Okay, then.
You Hoyt?
Ah, Detective Morris.
Thank you for comin' down.
Have a seat.
What'll you have?
Whatever's on tap.
- Boss, a beer, please.
- Sure thing.
Thanks.
There you go.
So what's this about?
Uh, I just thought we could talk.
You didn't bring me down here to tell war stories, did you?
No, no.
The Chief M.E. was wondering why you didn't testify in the Jake Logan trials.
I heard he dug Jake up.
What's he doin'?
I'm not sure, but I told him if he wants to mess the case up, he should not count on me.
Well, I was on an extradition pick-up in Utah for the first trial, in the hospital for the second.
Shoulder surgery.
Could have gotten a sub to do that pick-up.
I didn't want to testify.
I sort of left something out my report.
The twenty grand I found in the trunk of Logan's squad car.
Hey, he wasn't on the take.
Liked to gamble.
Sometimes he won big.
It would have just muddied the issues.
You would have done the same thing.
Well, what happened to the money?
I gave it to his father.
Prosecutor never heard about this?
No, why would I tell her?
It had nothing to do with the murder.
Hey, you don't have to convince me.
So there wasn't anything nefarious goin' on.
The guy just wasn't available to testify either time.
It's not like Walcott needed him.
Yeah?
Yeah, I see him.
No-no, it's okay.
Mister Logan.
The District Attorney didn't ask you to look into anything.
You lied to us.
- Who are you.
- Detective Hoyt.
You're a cop.
You're helping him.
If you'll have a seat, I'll try to explain.
I can listen standing up.
The original autopsy performed on your son was unprofessional.
- Were you there?
- No, I pulled the report and I read it.
Why?
- I want an answer, Macy.
- I was curious.
And what sparked your curiosity?
Mister Logan, I understand why you're upset, but sometimes-
Can I get a straight answer out of you?
No, sir.
I don't have an answer.
If that piece of garbage that killed my son gets off because of you, you need to watch your back.
Sir, I understand that you're angry, but that's no reason to threaten people.
You heard me.
You heard me.
What are you doing this for?
- Ready when you are, Doctor M.
- Now what?
- The tape from the dashboard camera.
- What for?
It was just accepted as is.
It was never even enhanced.
Doctor Macy, you've got to tell me the truth.
I'm beginning to think that Ainsworth is innocent, okay?
Let's go.
Two days and you think you're deadlocked.
What's the split?
Just the numbers, please.
Last vote, nine to three.
Then you're three votes from success.
Your Honor, we won't ever reach a verdict because that crazy lady right there will never convince me to vote not guilty.
That's enough, sir.
- Uh, may I say something, Your Honor?
- Is it more name calling?
No, sir.
Uh, there's just so much insufficient information in this case.
We can't reach any logical conclusions.
Stop right there, Doctor Cavanaugh.
We all saw the same evidence, and there's no way you can sell me that position.
There's also no way I will declare a mistrial after only two days.
You will return to the jury room and you will stay there until you reach a verdict.
Is that as clear as you can get it?
Lord, no.
Now, it would help if I knew what you were looking for.
What's that right there?
In the mirror?
It's another video artifact, probably.
- Can you get the two men clearer?
- Yeah.
Morris say anything else?
Found a big a wad of cash from Logan's trunk.
Morris didn't put it in his report.
- Dirty cop?
- No, a gambler.
I spoke to some of the other guys who said he was a stand-up guy and a great cop.
Yeah, with a gambling problem.
Gentlemen.
Stop the tape.
What is that?
That shadow right there.
Well, perhaps it's just a shadow.
We convert to frequency domain.
Enhance the spike.
Or perhaps a gun.
Ainsworth testified he wasn't carrying that night.
You still think the son of a bitch is innocent?
You still think Ainsworth didn't do it?
I never said that.
So you'll tell the judge?
What for.
If this were exculpatory, he could halt deliberations, but not for this.
I've had my turn.
Police report says the D.A.'s investigator spent a couple days looking for the gun ten years ago, but the cops don't have a copy of his search grid.
Now you're gonna prove my case for me?
What happened to "Jordan has a reason for everything she does"?
If that jury hangs and you have to try Ainsworth a third time, you're gonna thank me for finding that gun.
If you do.
Guilty.
Not guilty.
Guilty.
Not guilty.
Guilty.
Not guilty.
Not guilty.
Nine not guilty.
Did any of you change your vote just because you want to get out of here
- and go home?
/ They all did.
- I didn't.
Aw, bull.
You know what?
It's not gonna do you any good.
Rest of you can whine as much as you want, because Rosenblatt, Harris and I are standin' firm.
This is the crime scene, and this is the fleabag hotel where Ainsworth was living.
- Overlay the police search grid.
- Mm-hm.
Looks like they covered every square inch between the two.
Guy from the D.A.'s Office?
Hansen's Dry Creek Bed.
Is it always dry?
Mmm, depends on the rainfall.
Cops checked the creek.
Not past here.
Where does it go?
Feeds down into Scarboro Pond, south end of the park.
I take it the pond was never dredged.
That's the problem with airtight cases.
Everybody gets overconfident.
You know, you might not need to call out the dredging crew.
Yeah, before it gets to the pond, it has to pass through here.
City must clean it out sometimes.
That's not ten years worth of debris.
Gun can't still be here.
If somebody found it, they would have turned it in.
Probably sank in the mud.
Nigel, get in there?
- The- these are new shoes.
- Take em off.
Gimme this thing.
I got this.
Man, it is nasty back here.
Alright.
I got a belt buckle.
I got some needle-nosed pliers.
I got
- I don't know what that is.
And
a thirty-two.
Clear.
It's Jordan, isn't it?
This trial would be over by now if she wasn't in there poking' holes in everything.
That'd be my guess.
Jordan being Jordan, guilty man's gonna go free.
You may need to rephrase that, Woody.
The striations are completely different.
They can't be.
It's Ainsworth's gun.
The serial numbers match.
Yeah, but the bullets don't.
This gun did not fire the fatal shot.
I don't know whether Ainsworth did it or not.
That's the whole point.
There's no category for innocent.
There's just guilty and not guilty, and if the evidence doesn't add up beyond a reasonable doubt, we have to vote not guilty regardless of how we feel about it.
Mister Rosenblatt?
When you put it that way, not guilty.
Well, that just leaves you and Richard.
I just can't get around the videotape.
If the tape didn't exist, how would you vote?
But it does exist.
All it tells us is that both men were there that night.
Everything else is discrepancy piled on anomaly.
The bottom line is the guy, Ainsworth.
Did you look at him?
Did you see what he is?
An addict, a loser, scum.
I didn't hear anything in the judge's instructions about convicting based on character.
Alright, I'm changing my vote.
Not guilty.
I was a cop for almost twenty years.
All day, every day I dealt with people like Darryl Ainsworth.
You're a doctor.
What do you know about the mean streets?
Almost twenty years?
Why almost?
What are you gettin' at?
Well, you get a full pension at twenty years.
Why didn't you stick around for it?
Maybe one too many brutality complaints?
Kick in the wrong door once too often?
Or- oh, and I
- I like this one- you buffed your reports to make sure that the scum got locked up, whether they were guilty or not.
Here it is.
Your last chance to play God.
You do realize this doesn't exonerate Ainsworth.
He could have been carrying a different gun that night.
If you don't show this to the judge, I will.
Oh, I'll show him.
If I can get him to call a mistrial, I can start over with a new jury.
I think he'd start over with a new investigation.
Alex, find Judge Marshall and tell him I need to see him urgently.
Alright, I'm
- I'm on my way.
The jury's reached a verdict.
- Doctor Macy.
- It'll have to wait, Nigel.
- No-no, this one can't.
- What is it?
!
Alright, that blur on the videotape, you know, the one that I thought was a video artifact.
I enhanced it.
You're not gonna believe what I found.
Come.
Has the jury reached a verdict?
Yes, Your Honor.
As to the sole count of the indictment, murder in the first degree, we find the defendant, Darryl Cole Ainsworth, not guilty.
- so much.
- the testimony.
He didn't know what the hell was goin'on.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, thank you for your service to the court.
You are excused.
The judge have something to say to us?
Please have a seat.
My office enhanced the video from your son's patrol car.
I think you know what we found.
What are you talking about?
Mister Logan?
There was a third car.
We got the license plate number.
It was your car.
Carl, what- what's going on?
Okay, then I'll tell you what we think happened.
You can correct me at any time.
Jake was stealing money from your business to pay for his gambling habit.
He wouldn't admit he had a problem and you couldn't stop him, so you decided to follow him to see what he was doing with the money.
I'm giving you... the benefit of the doubt here, assuming you didn't set out to kill him.
With him being a cop, an unexpected opportunity arose.
Way for you to make all your problems go away.
You stopped Darryl Ainsworth for a broken taillight.
When he and Ainsworth started fighting... you found yourself in the perfect situation.
Dad?
What are you doin'?
See, we prefer to think that... you just happened to have a gun in your car, and desperation pushed you over the edge.
Carl?
I spent my whole life building up my business.
I just couldn't make him stop.
Mr. Logan, you should speak with an attorney before you say anything else.
Nice to know I didn't help get a killer off.
Yeah, it's nice to know the system works.
The system needs a serious overhaul.
Jordan, the next time you're called for jury duty, let your shrink know.
I'm sure there's a reason you should be excused.
Wow, did you mean to call me a nut job or are you just crabby?
Okay, crabby it is.
But I've got something to cheer you up.
Ballpoint pen through the eye, autopsy two.
I know you love those ballpoint pen cases.
Hi, Renee.
Garret.
Well, movin' on.
Uh, before you go, thank you.
Okay, what for?
It can't have been easy standing up by yourself in there.
You did a good thing.
Well, thanks.
Why?
What made you doubt the case so much?
I didn't in the beginning.
I just thought uh, well, nobody else wanted to talk about it.
It seemed to me that was the whole reason we were there.
Okay, good.
Um, I came by to tell you.
I don't know how to swim.
It's never too late to learn.
Well, maybe not tonight since you're busy.
With what?
With the ballpoint pen thing with Jordan.
Well, don't you think this is more important?
Do you?
Are you always gonna be this challenging?
Isn't that what you like about me?
Most people tend to their personal hygiene at home.
This bothers you?
No, what bothers me is that it doesn't bother me anymore.
I'm an acquired taste.
Actually, it's more like the Stockholm syndrome.
The emotional attachment to a captor formed by hostages are result of continuous stress and a need to cooperate for survival.
Nice shot.
Get the truck.
Where we going, boss?
Smoky Corners, West Virginia.
Marine helo was found abandoned.
-Crew's missing.
-Any leads?
You tell me.
It's sitting in the middle of a crop circle.
Abby's going to make us crazy.
Come on, let's go.
I don't believe it.
They never make it easy.
Lieutenant Colonel Curtis Teague.
Squadron CO.
HMLA 167.
Gibbs.
NCIS.
Colonel, your people have contaminated the scene.
I'm missing two men, Gibbs.
Wasn't going to sit on my ass and wait for NCIS to drive out from Washington.
Yeah, well, we're going to have to take elimination prints from all your people.
Let NCIS do their job.
Stand down.
Any damage to the aircraft?
No.
The engine checks out.
Hydraulic and avionics gear are operative.
Fuel load's at 60 percent.
When was your last contact with the crew?
They took off from New River at 2300 on a routine night proficiency flight.
Were cleared to a practice area over Chesapeake Bay.
Flight controller lost the transponder signal ten minutes out.
Tried to make radio contact, never got a response.
I was notified a half hour later.
How'd you find it?
We were organizing to launch a search and rescue mission when I got a call from the local sheriff.
The farmer that owns this field discovered it just after sunrise.
DiNozzo.
Yeah, boss?
Sketch and shoot.
Kate, the cockpit.
Trace evidence, bag and tag.
-McGee, the field.
Lay out a grid.
-Got it.
We just started the air search.
Hopefully we'll find them.
I'm ignoring the fact that my aircraft is in the middle of a crop circle.
What about you, Agent Gibbs, what are your thoughts?
Do I think your men were abducted by aliens, Colonel?
No.
I don't, but I'm not going to ignore anything.
I need an overhead view of the field.
Already took digital photos.
Sergeant Ramos!
Sir.
Camera.
Who are the missing men?
Pilot is Captain Todd Newell.
Co-pilot Captain Patrick Barnett.
Good marines.
But they're young pilots.
Hot shots.
The two are close.
They share an apartment off base.
I need their Officer Qualification Records and NATOPS jackets.
McGee!
Yeah, boss?
Shots of the crop circle.
E-mail them to Abby.
Abby?
You certain you want to do that?
You know, she's obsessed with the paranormal and...
Right.
I'm on it.
I do not want UFO freaks crawling around here, Colonel.
Let's keep a lid on this.
No releases to the media.
Agreed.
I should've been an aviator.
These things are chick magnets.
I hate helicopters.
They're loud, uncomfortable and dangerous.
Used to dread getting on Marine One with the President.
Ew.
Tony...
What?
You're getting way too comfortable around me.
Okay, clipping your nails is one thing, but that, that is crossing the line.
Come on.
No, I'm serious.
I've had enough of your locker room mentality.
I would be upset if someone I was dating dating took such familiarities.
Well, we work together.
So feel free to scratch or adjust anything you like in front of me.
I'm always up before the sun.
It's only 30 acres, but it's a lot of work.
You didn't hear anything last night?
Nothing.
So how long you think it's gonna be before they get that thing out of here?
I got work to do.
What do you think happened to your field?
You're asking me?
Ask the Air Force.
This isn't the first crop circle here.
We had one in 1994.
The Air Force investigated, but we never did get no answers.
There were lights back then, too.
Lights?
Lit up the sky last night.
Woke me up.
It wasn't lightning.
There was no thunder.
Like I told you, I didn't hear anything.
Just tried to put it out of my mind till I discovered this.
We may have more questions for you, Mr. Clay.
I ain't going nowhere.
Well, guess I should ask around.
See if anybody else seen something.
How long you been sheriff?
Couple years now.
Your full-time job?
I also run the grain and feed store.
Whoa.
McGee, you are turning me on.
It's very Glastonbury, circa 1980s.
I mean, not quite as large or elaborate, but it's a fascinating pictogram.
I'm not familiar with Glastonbury.
Southern England?
Where most of the crop circles were found?
Abby, they're hoaxes.
You have to admit they are interesting.
Yeah, I put them right up there with tarot cards and telephone psychics.
Thought two farmers admitted to creating them.
Yeah, but there's been over 10,000 reported all over the world.
There's no way those two did them all.
Abby, nothing paranormal happened here.
Yeah, there was no damage to the helicopter, yet the entire crew vanished.
You can't take crop circles seriously, you're a scientist.
There's a logical explanation.
Listen to me, McGee.
I need pictures, and lots of them.
And specimens of the stalks down to the roots.
And a core sample of soil, at least 12 inches.
Make sure you get a control sample from outside the circle.
Abby, we're looking for two missing marines.
Come on, McGee.
Do it for me, please?
I'll show you my new tat.
The replacement crew is ready to fly the Cobra back to New River.
Go ahead, we got everything we need.
Clear to go.
Do we really need all this stuff?
Just following instructions.
Ask Abby.
All right, McGee and I will take the truck back.
You two, check out the pilots' apartment.
Right.
I'll try not to be too familiar, Ms. Todd.
Hey, get the scent articles for the search dog.
Okay.
What is it, boss?
I was worried about keeping a lid on this thing.
Where are the gawkers?
You see any locals other than the farmer who owns this field and the sheriff?
Special Agent Gibbs.
The Huey spotted a burnt-out area just north of here.
You might want to come with us.
You think this has something to do with my crew?
I don't know, but we're going to find out.
We've got another scene to process.
So, we're looking for anything that suggests they didn't just leave on a routine flight.
Thanks for explaining, Special Agent DiNozzo.
Oh, my God, I don't believe it.
Do you know what this is?
This is a classic.
December '92.
Pamela's debut.
I lost my copy.
Lost it or wore it out?
We need to get scent articles for the dogs.
What the hell are you doing in my apartment?
NCIS.
Let her go.
I understand you're not cooperating, Captain Barnett.
I don't know anything.
It's Saturday night.
I was at my girlfriend's.
Got home, just getting out of the shower and I heard someone in my apartment.
Where's Captain Newell?
I don't know.
You were scheduled for a proficiency flight at 2300 last night.
Did you take it?
What's the flight schedule say, sir?
Well, it says right here Newell and you took off from New River.
Then we did.
Here's how it works, ace.
I ask the questions, you give direct answers.
Did you take the flight?
I think Gibbs enjoys this more than sex.
That would explain the three wives.
Your Cobra was found abandoned 150 miles from where it was supposed to be and Newell is missing.
What is Gibbs doing?
TBI.
Excuse me?
Truth by intimidation.
In five... four... three... two... one.
We were leaving for the base when Todd got a call on his cell.
He took it into the bedroom.
When he came out... he was messed up.
He said he wasn't feeling well and wanted to call the Squadron Deputy
Officer in Ops to cancel the hop.
Who made the call?
I don't know.
I don't believe you, Barnett.
You live together, you fly together, you fight together, you share everything.
I thought we did.
Look, I rode his ass to figure out what was going on, but Todd, he got really pissed.
Told me to lay low for the rest of the night.
He didn't want me getting in trouble.
And you let it go at that?
Todd said he'd explain when he got back.
I believe him.
Sign it.
What did Gibbs whisper in his ear?
If I knew, I'd be Gibbs.
I'm gonna go pull Captain Newell's cell records.
Did you feel an energy when you were inside the circle, McGee?
Did you get a tingling sensation or start to vibrate?
You're gonna vibrate if you don't do what Gibbs wants.
I'm running tests on the molecular structure of plants from within and outside the circle.
Okay, Abby, Gibbs made it clear the priority is the cabin fire.
You know, people try to imitate the real thing, but the notion that all recorded formations were man-made with simple flattening tools does not explain the well-documented plant alterations by electromagnetic effect.
I warned you.
Operation Duty Officer at New River said that Captain Newell signed the log.
When I pressed, he admitted that he never really saw Captain Barnett.
He just assumed he was on the flight line, preflighting.
So Newell took off alone.
Can you fly a Cobra by yourself?
Oh, yes.
Yeah, I'm still here.
Anything unusual in Newell's OQR or his NATOPS jacket?
He's an only child.
Grew up in Florida, just outside Orlando.
Any connection to West Virginia?
No.
His parents died in an auto accident two years ago.
His father sold insurance, and mother was an accountant at Disney World.
Yeah, Gibbs.
You can see Barnett anytime you'd like, Colonel.
Teague?
Good C.O.
Newell went through NROTC at the University of Florida before flight school.
His impulsiveness has gotten him in some trouble.
A fight cost him a non-punitive letter of caution.
That's great.
Last call Captain Newell got on his cell was at 2130 last night.
Hasn't made or received a call since.
His phone is currently off.
Where was the call from?
A pay phone in Smoky Corners, West Virginia.
According to the phone company, this thing hardly ever gets used.
Well, I guess even people out here have cell phones.
We're being watched.
Mm-hmm.
I see.
Sheriff Thompson.
You better get over here.
Find anything?
It's clean.
Too clean.
Not even a smudge.
Yeah, looks like the only thing out here that has been cleaned recently.
Let me have a whack at it.
What's he doing?
Okay.
Get those to Abby for prints.
What are you doing to the phone?
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.
Who are you?
Ritt Everett.
This is my store.
Seen anyone using the phone Tuesday night?
Well, let's see.
Nope.
This have anything to do about that helicopter in the crop circle?
Hello, Sheriff.
Special Agent Gibbs.
Any luck?
Well, sir, luck doesn't have much to do with it.
I've been asking around.
Lot of folks seen them lights and are complaining their animals are acting out of sorts.
How?
Chickens stopped laying eggs.
Cows ain't producing, and stuff like that.
Either of you two seen him around?
No.
Name's Newell.
Captain Todd Newell.
Sorry, ain't seen him.
Newell?
Ain't nobody by that name in the Corners.
I'll keep an eye out for him.
Was he the one flying that helicopter?
Yeah, Gibbs.
Gibbs, I am getting stonewalled here.
By who?
The Air Force.
I requested their file on the 1994 crop circles in Smoky Corners, you'd thought I'd asked them for their missile-launch codes.
Okay, I'll make a call.
No, you don't understand.
They're not going to tell you anything either.
This is like Area 51; it is conspiracy at the highest level.
Abby, stop yourself.
What about the cabin fire?
Gibbs, this is big!
The fire.
Unfortunately, nothing extraterrestrial there;
arson, plain old gasoline was used as an accelerant.
I'm still working on the debris.
Science can't be rushed, Gibbs.
Hi.
You all right?
Yeah, fine.
Ever see him around here?
Your gal going to be okay?
Don't you worry about her.
As long as both sides stick to the story, we'll get through this.
I can't talk right now.
But if you come back at noon, my daddy will be at the VFW in Potterville.
Okay.
Who's that?
The station owner's daughter, Daphne.
I think she wanted to talk, but couldn't.
Her father's having lunch with his buddies at the VFW in Potterville around noon.
She'll be alone.
The dogs are a no-go.
The handlers say something screwed up the dogs.
As soon as they stepped into the woods, they started acting up.
Do not tell Abby.
She's going to make something out of it.
We should start checking the back of their necks for little red Xs.
What are you talking about?
Invaders From Mars.
Wait.
I take it that's a film?
Original 1953 version, not the remake.
Everything's a movie to you, Tony.
Aliens landed in a field just like this one.
Took over the locals' minds, leaving a little red "X" on the back of the necks.
Sounds lame.
Oh, no.
Scariest movie I ever saw.
Especially when this kid tries to tell his mom and dad what's going on, the camera slowly comes around, reveals Xs on the back of Mom and Dad's necks.
Whew.
Scared of my parents for years after that.
I'm sure the feeling was mutual.
Find anything?
Uh, yeah, interviewed half a dozen locals.
Nobody saw or heard a helicopter.
Everyone has the same story.
B.O.L.s.
"Balls of light."
According to Abby, they're created by
Manipulating the atomic particles in the atmosphere.
Mm.
And who does the manipulating, McGee?
I really don't know, sir.
I'm just relating what Abby told me.
I need you to run a tox screen on this tissue sample.
Where'd you get it?
A body exhumed from Arlington.
You look overwhelmed.
I am.
And this just came in from the field.
Gibbs wants me to run prints on it ASAP.
It appears to be to be $1.65.
This poor soul's been dead for 36 years.
I doubt if a few more days will matter.
Thank you, Ducky.
Door handle?
Yeah, it came from a cabin fire.
I found traces of something in it.
I can use a second opinion.
I'm flattered.
Mammalian cells.
Most likely human flesh.
Someone was trapped I that fire.
A missing Marine aviator?
I need to call Gibbs.
Could be his missing aviator is dead.
If he died, where are his remains?
We know the fire was arson.
It started around the same time Newell and his helo disappeared.
Abby was pretty certain somebody was in the cabin.
But we didn't find any remains.
Maybe they got out.
Or someone removed the body.
Until we find remains, I'm not going to connect the dots.
Time to get the cadaver dogs up to aid the search.
Cadaver dogs coming up.
This your cabin, Mr. Clay?
Nope.
No.
My land stops right over there at the treeline there.
Who's it belong to?
Well, nobody, really.
Went to the county after Monroe died.
Who was Monroe?
A farmer from the east side.
Tried working this parcel.
Didn't have no chance, though.
Too hard to clear.
How'd Monroe die?
Hunting.
Accident.
Shack's been abandoned ever since.
I ain't sorry it burned, though.
Kids was always using the place, causing trouble.
Something wrong?
Bet his rk's worse than his bite, huh?
Uh, the bite's actually much worse.
Daphne?
Whatcha lookin' fer?
I need gas.
This way, Missy.
That'll be $6.00.
That's ten.
That's two, that's three, four dollars.
Sure that's all you want?
So, uh... what can State Police do for NCIS?
Well, we're investigating a helicopter incident in Smoky Corners.
Yeah, I heard.
You, uh...?
Sure.
Have a seat.
Met the sheriff.
Oh, Miller Thompson?
Yeah, he wasn't much help.
Well, he doesn't know about enem
But he sure loves wearing that uniform.
You get to Smoky Corners much?
Well, not ss they call.
And they don't.
Hmm.
No crime?
Nothing we get involin.
There's a fights.
Got some kind of feud going on up there.
Goes back decades.
What, like Hatfields and McCoys?
Yeah, something like that.
I honestly donhiny remembers itrted, but it split the valley right down the middle, east versus west, and I was told by my predecessor to stay clear.
Tris, they take careof their own problems.
Have they ever had a murder in Smoky Corners?
I mean, people just di natural causes or, you know, the occasional farm or hunting accident.
Things may have changed.
What's McGee doing out there?
Scanning the field with a magnetometer.
Let me guess Abby?
Her every wish is his command.
She promiso shim her new tattoo.
Wail finds or it ankle.
What did gas station girl tell you?
She was a no-show.
looks like magnet.
You are such a child.
Come on.
Just taking a sip.
It's yours.
Hey, boss.
Abby needs to talk to you.
Abs, you get any sleep?
I am overworked and not paid enough.
Quit.
What do you got?
Two partial prints on the coins from the phone booth.
Any match?
You need to send a thank you to the West Virginia DMV.
The got right index prints from two licensed drivers.
One was the trucker that delivered gasoline to the station, the second was a local, Greg Sikes.
On it.
You get any DNA off the doorknob?
"Nice work on those prints, Abs."
Thank you.
"I know you haven't had a break in two days."
Oh, that's okay.
I don't need much sleep.
Anything for the team.
I assume you'll let me know if you find something.
Don't I always?
Yeah, Abby, you do.
Thank you.
Agent Gibbs.
The cadaver dogs have found something.
Get Ducky.
Smoky Corners bachelor quarters.
Something to be said for living in a trailer.
Get tired of the view, you just roll it to a new location.
Come on, McGee.
What, are you never going to talk to me again?
How long am I going to be the butt of your practical jokes, snide innuendos and juvenile put-downs?
I will always outrank you, probie.
Come on.
Mr. Sikes, NCIS.
Whoa.
Come on in.
Someone left in a hurry.
Huh, no phone.
Ah, nice... teeth.
Duck, what can you tell me?
Uh, not much.
Male, roughly six feet.
Tests I did on femur, clavicle, suggest not that old.
Give me a range.
Mid 20's to 30's.
Oh, this distinctive fracture on the inferior left scapula is consistent with a bullet wound.
Cause of death?
Well, maybe.
Or it could be trauma or asphyxiation.
I don't know if I'll ever be certain.
There's not much to work with, Jethro.
Gibbs!
Yeah?
I used nonisotopic chemiluminescent method to compare the charred DNA to Newell's.
Uh-huh, and?
And it's not his DNA.
But it's damn close.
Oh, come on, Abs.
We're not playing horseshoes.
There's a 99% probability that the fire victim is Newell's male sibling.
That can't be.
Newell's record of emergency data doesn't list a brother.
DNA doesn't lie, Jethro.
People do.
The crispy critter was Captain Newell's brother.
His OQR was wrong?
Recruits lie about things all the timeespecially their age.
Why lie about having a brother?
Is Abby sure?
Yeah, she double checked.
Obviously you two didn't.
We assumed his family history was right.
NCIS agents don't assume anything, Agent Todd.
They check and re-check.
Verify, everything, independently.
We are on it.
There's a definite difference.
I don't see it.
Look at the elongated node.
It's undamaged.
The plants inside the crop circle were changed in a way that is beyond human ability.
I'm rerunning an analysis hoping to find anomalous molecular change to the stalks within the circle.
I'm betting they were subjected to a very short blast of high energy heat, possibly microwave generated.
Rerunning because you came up empty.
Abby, you're looking for something that isn't there.
You've been here for two days straight.
You're tired, you've done everything that
Gibbs has asked, so go home, get some sleep.
I can't sleep.
What are you doing?
You're guilty of confirmation bias.
It's not there, Abs.
You're ignoring the obvious and you're searching for microscopic proof of something that doesn't exist.
Maybe I should join the CIA.
Look at the big picture.
The design of the smaller outer circles was created by bending the corn stalks down in a clockwise direction.
Now look under the helicopter.
Those pants were forced outward from the center by the downdraft of the blades.
The corn was still standing and was forced down by the landing of the Cobra.
Crop circle's a hoax, Abby.
Created, created around a parked helicopter.
Why would anyone do that?
Orange County clerk faxed us his parents marriage certificate.
Todd Newell was nine years old when his mother remarried.
he was legally adopted, that's how he got the Newell name.
His mother's maiden name was Stelling, which is common in Smoky Corners.
First husband's a guy named Sikes.
They had two boys Greg and Todd.
Todd Newell was born in Smoky Corners.
His co-pilot, Captain Barnett, swears that he never
Mentioned a brother or Smoky Corners.
In fact, Barnett couldn't recall Newell ever mentioning anything about his childhood.
We need to find his biological father.
Can't, he died several years ago... in a hunting accident.
Aw, gee, where have I heard that one before?
So we got a dead civilian in Ducky's cooler.
We going to turn it over to the local authorities?
Nope, not yet.
I want to know more, first.
Greg Sikes was involved with the girl at the gas station.
She seemed willing to talk.
Maybe I should go back there and try to find her.
Go with her.
All right, so we're on the same page, right?
I guess, but let me tell Gibbs.
Tell me what?
The crop circle was a hoax, created around the helicopter after it landed.
You don't sound convincing, Abs.
Yeah, well, there's still a lot of stuff that can't be explained.
Like what?
Balls of light in the sky, the animals acting weird, like, a missing pilot.
Everyone's story is exactly the same.
It's too rehearsed.
It's what they want us to hear.
That's exactly what I told her.
But what about the search dogs?
I heard they were acting all confused and disoriented.
Only the first day.
The cadaver dogs had no problem finding the body this morning.
I know why we haven't been able to find Captain Newell.
Thanks, guys.
How do you know?
Because I'm a Marine.
Newell is alive?
Yeah.
Well, who's body did we find?
His brother.
Captain Newell's still out there.
How do you know that?
He received SERE training, Colonel.
He's evading us.
As part of his training he was taught a technique to negate enemy dogs.
Yeah, GS powder, the irritant used in gas mask simulations.
I keep a couple of capsules in my survival vest.
Dogs get a whiff of that, they're useless for days.
He used it on the search dogs.
Now he also has pilot's night-vision goggles and a survival radio to monitor our search frequencies.
Colonel, he's using his Marine Corps training to evade us.
Will you stop that?
You're driving me crazy.
Sorry.
Do I detect a little PMS?
I didn't think that was till next week.
Hey, it's a high-stress job.
You carry a gun.
I need to know when you're not your best.
Sike's trailer is coming up.
Daphne wasn't at the gas station.
If she's not there, I don't know where else to look.
That's Daphne's truck.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey!
Hey!
Daphne, why are you running?
I thought you wanted to talk to us, Daphne.
Daphne, talk to us.
What happened?
What happened?
Are you looking for Greg?
We know he's your boyfriend, that's why we're here looking for you, okay?
Where is he?
Daphne, are you pregnant?
Five months.
Greg's hiding from my daddy.
You know where he is?
Greg's dead, isn't he?
Whatever Newell's brother said to him on the phone got him upset enough to risk his entire careerwith an unauthorized flight in a Cobra.
Boss, you sure you don't want me to drive for a while?
But why land in the farmer's field?
Um, well...
My guess, McGee... it was the closest clearing to the cabin where is brother was hiding, only Newell was too late.
Wh-What?
Focus on the case, McGee.
Sorry, uh, yes, Sir.
Why the crop circle?
Well, uh, I have a theory on that.
You care to share?
Yeah, uh, okay.
Spit it out, McGee.
Okay, uh...
Whoever killed Greg Sikes thought that they could cover it up as another farm or hunting accident.
But they couldn't cover up an attack helicopter abandoned in a corn field.
Conspiracy, huh?
Makes sense.
Take a lot of people to form that pattern in a few hours.
Right, and they knew that there would be an outside investigation, so they created the circle hoping that we'd do exactly what the Air Force did ten years ago back off and cover up what couldn't be explained.
Not bad, McGee.
Not bad.
Where is she?
Inside, she seemed to relate better to Kate.
joy the ride, McGee?
Daphne's father threatened to kill Greg because...
She's pregnant.
Greg and me from different corners of the valley.
God, I hate this rotten place.
This stupid feud.
When'd you last see him?
At the gas station.
Using the payphone to call his brother for help.
Was Greg close to his brother?
He hadn't seen him since they was kids.
About a year ago he got a call telling him their mother died.
It reunited them.
They're the only family either of them have left.
Daphne's afraid that Captain Newell's been drawn back into the feud.
He's gonna kill my daddy to get revenge.
Kate, you and McGee get Daphne out of here.
What's up, boss?
Go for Teague.
Colonel, call off the search.
Pull your men out.
Why?
You said Newell's still out there.
He is.
He wants revenge.
But he's not going to make his move until he thinks we're gone.
They're leaving.
Ritt, we pulled it off.
The Marines have backed off.
This thing's going away.
Nobody's told outsiders nothing.
My problem... is Greg Sikes' brother.
See, I got to get him, 'for he gets me.
This is White Hawk 3-4.
Terminating search.
Returning to base.
3-4 out.
Ritt, think twice about what you're fixing to do.
They ain't got nothing, Ritt.
Just stick to the story.
What's going on?
Looks like y'all are pulling out.
The Marines are, we aren't.
Do you get a kick out of smacking your daughter around?
Why don't you just get out of here?
DiNozzo, read him his rights.
What are you talking about?
The murder of Greg Sikes.
Greg Sikes is dead?
I thought he went hunting.
We found his remains.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Ain't you out of your jurisdiction?
You're the law here, Miller.
Yeah, I am.
Don't get excited, Sheriff.
The West Virginia State Police are on their way, but I do have the authority to detain both of you until they arrive.
We, too, have guns.
White man has more guns and more warriors.
We need one of your people to guide us through the mountains.
Gibbs, I have a bogey.
In the trees, closing in from the northwest.
Everybody copy.
Yeah, boss.
Got it.
He slipped behind the old cars.
Let him get closer.
Roger that.
Oh, man.
He made me.
Hit the lights!
NCIS!
Lower your weapon,
Captain Newell!
It's over.
It's not over till Ritt Everett's dead.
He's in the custody of the State Police.
That's not going to change anything.
It's an eye-for-an-eye here, always has been.
Is that why your mother took you away?
Put down your weapon.
Why?
I'm never going to fly again.
No, your career's probably over, but you haven't hurt anybody yet.
Keep it that way, and I'll do everything I can to help you.
There is a young girl carrying your brother's baby
and they could sure use your help.
Once we left, it was like Smoky Corners never existed.
My mother erased it from our lives.
I always felt guilty she had to leave Greg behind, but our father wouldn't let her have both of us.
Why'd you take the Cobra?
It's fierce, intimidating.
I hoped it would scare the crap out of those hicks, save Greg's life.
And I was too late.
The cabin was in flames, Greg trapped inside.
Everett and the others started shooting at me and I got hit.
And they had hunting rifles, I only had my pistol.
I was cut off from the helo, couldn't get back to the base.
I knew my Marine Corps career was over.
All that was left for me was revenge.
Wow, those are really pretty, Kate.
Where are they from?
Tony.
We had a tough couple of days.
Kate pointed out that I'd taken one too many liberties.
The flowers are a mea culpa.
Tony, I'm blown away.
They're gorgeous.
And they're from Martha's Garden, my favorite florist.
How'd you know?
Lucky guess.
He went through your purse and got the phone number off your PDA.
Most people tend to their personal hygiene at home.
This bothers you?
No, what bothers me is that it doesn't bother me anymore.
I'm an acquired taste.
Actually, it's more like the Stockholm syndrome.
The emotional attachment to a captor formed by hostages are result of continuous stress and a need to cooperate for survival.
Nice shot.
Get the truck.
Where we going, boss?
Smoky Corners, West Virginia.
Marine helo was found abandoned.
-Crew's missing.
-Any leads?
You tell me.
It's sitting in the middle of a crop circle.
Abby's going to make us crazy.
Come on, let's go.
I don't believe it.
They never make it easy.
Lieutenant Colonel Curtis Teague.
Squadron CO.
HMLA 167.
Gibbs.
NCIS.
Colonel, your people have contaminated the scene.
I'm missing two men, Gibbs.
Wasn't going to sit on my ass and wait for NCIS to drive out from Washington.
Yeah, well, we're going to have to take elimination prints from all your people.
Let NCIS do their job.
Stand down.
Any damage to the aircraft?
No.
The engine checks out.
Hydraulic and avionics gear are operative.
Fuel load's at 60 percent.
When was your last contact with the crew?
They took off from New River at 2300 on a routine night proficiency flight.
Were cleared to a practice area over Chesapeake Bay.
Flight controller lost the transponder signal ten minutes out.
Tried to make radio contact, never got a response.
I was notified a half hour later.
How'd you find it?
We were organizing to launch a search and rescue mission when I got a call from the local sheriff.
The farmer that owns this field discovered it just after sunrise.
DiNozzo.
Yeah, boss?
Sketch and shoot.
Kate, the cockpit.
Trace evidence, bag and tag.
-McGee, the field.
Lay out a grid.
-Got it.
We just started the air search.
Hopefully we'll find them.
I'm ignoring the fact that my aircraft is in the middle of a crop circle.
What about you, Agent Gibbs, what are your thoughts?
Do I think your men were abducted by aliens, Colonel?
No.
I don't, but I'm not going to ignore anything.
I need an overhead view of the field.
Already took digital photos.
Sergeant Ramos!
Sir.
Camera.
Who are the missing men?
Pilot is Captain Todd Newell.
Co-pilot Captain Patrick Barnett.
Good marines.
But they're young pilots.
Hot shots.
The two are close.
They share an apartment off base.
I need their Officer Qualification Records and NATOPS jackets.
McGee!
Yeah, boss?
Shots of the crop circle.
E-mail them to Abby.
Abby?
You certain you want to do that?
You know, she's obsessed with the paranormal and...
Right.
I'm on it.
I do not want UFO freaks crawling around here, Colonel.
Let's keep a lid on this.
No releases to the media.
Agreed.
I should've been an aviator.
These things are chick magnets.
I hate helicopters.
They're loud, uncomfortable and dangerous.
Used to dread getting on Marine One with the President.
Ew.
Tony...
What?
You're getting way too comfortable around me.
Okay, clipping your nails is one thing, but that, that is crossing the line.
Come on.
No, I'm serious.
I've had enough of your locker room mentality.
I would be upset if someone I was dating dating took such familiarities.
Well, we work together.
So feel free to scratch or adjust anything you like in front of me.
I'm always up before the sun.
It's only 30 acres, but it's a lot of work.
You didn't hear anything last night?
Nothing.
So how long you think it's gonna be before they get that thing out of here?
I got work to do.
What do you think happened to your field?
You're asking me?
Ask the Air Force.
This isn't the first crop circle here.
We had one in 1994.
The Air Force investigated, but we never did get no answers.
There were lights back then, too.
Lights?
Lit up the sky last night.
Woke me up.
It wasn't lightning.
There was no thunder.
Like I told you, I didn't hear anything.
Just tried to put it out of my mind till I discovered this.
We may have more questions for you, Mr. Clay.
I ain't going nowhere.
Well, guess I should ask around.
See if anybody else seen something.
How long you been sheriff?
Couple years now.
Your full-time job?
I also run the grain and feed store.
Whoa.
McGee, you are turning me on.
It's very Glastonbury, circa 1980s.
I mean, not quite as large or elaborate, but it's a fascinating pictogram.
I'm not familiar with Glastonbury.
Southern England?
Where most of the crop circles were found?
Abby, they're hoaxes.
You have to admit they are interesting.
Yeah, I put them right up there with tarot cards and telephone psychics.
Thought two farmers admitted to creating them.
Yeah, but there's been over 10,000 reported all over the world.
There's no way those two did them all.
Abby, nothing paranormal happened here.
Yeah, there was no damage to the helicopter, yet the entire crew vanished.
You can't take crop circles seriously, you're a scientist.
There's a logical explanation.
Listen to me, McGee.
I need pictures, and lots of them.
And specimens of the stalks down to the roots.
And a core sample of soil, at least 12 inches.
Make sure you get a control sample from outside the circle.
Abby, we're looking for two missing marines.
Come on, McGee.
Do it for me, please?
I'll show you my new tat.
The replacement crew is ready to fly the Cobra back to New River.
Go ahead, we got everything we need.
Clear to go.
Do we really need all this stuff?
Just following instructions.
Ask Abby.
All right, McGee and I will take the truck back.
You two, check out the pilots' apartment.
Right.
I'll try not to be too familiar, Ms. Todd.
Hey, get the scent articles for the search dog.
Okay.
What is it, boss?
I was worried about keeping a lid on this thing.
Where are the gawkers?
You see any locals other than the farmer who owns this field and the sheriff?
Special Agent Gibbs.
The Huey spotted a burnt-out area just north of here.
You might want to come with us.
You think this has something to do with my crew?
I don't know, but we're going to find out.
We've got another scene to process.
So, we're looking for anything that suggests they didn't just leave on a routine flight.
Thanks for explaining, Special Agent DiNozzo.
Oh, my God, I don't believe it.
Do you know what this is?
This is a classic.
December '92.
Pamela's debut.
I lost my copy.
Lost it or wore it out?
We need to get scent articles for the dogs.
What the hell are you doing in my apartment?
NCIS.
Let her go.
I understand you're not cooperating, Captain Barnett.
I don't know anything.
It's Saturday night.
I was at my girlfriend's.
Got home, just getting out of the shower and I heard someone in my apartment.
Where's Captain Newell?
I don't know.
You were scheduled for a proficiency flight at 2300 last night.
Did you take it?
What's the flight schedule say, sir?
Well, it says right here Newell and you took off from New River.
Then we did.
Here's how it works, ace.
I ask the questions, you give direct answers.
Did you take the flight?
I think Gibbs enjoys this more than sex.
That would explain the three wives.
Your Cobra was found abandoned 150 miles from where it was supposed to be and Newell is missing.
What is Gibbs doing?
TBI.
Excuse me?
Truth by intimidation.
In five... four... three... two... one.
We were leaving for the base when Todd got a call on his cell.
He took it into the bedroom.
When he came out... he was messed up.
He said he wasn't feeling well and wanted to call the Squadron Deputy
Officer in Ops to cancel the hop.
Who made the call?
I don't know.
I don't believe you, Barnett.
You live together, you fly together, you fight together, you share everything.
I thought we did.
Look, I rode his ass to figure out what was going on, but Todd, he got really pissed.
Told me to lay low for the rest of the night.
He didn't want me getting in trouble.
And you let it go at that?
Todd said he'd explain when he got back.
I believe him.
Sign it.
What did Gibbs whisper in his ear?
If I knew, I'd be Gibbs.
I'm gonna go pull Captain Newell's cell records.
Did you feel an energy when you were inside the circle, McGee?
Did you get a tingling sensation or start to vibrate?
You're gonna vibrate if you don't do what Gibbs wants.
I'm running tests on the molecular structure of plants from within and outside the circle.
Okay, Abby, Gibbs made it clear the priority is the cabin fire.
You know, people try to imitate the real thing, but the notion that all recorded formations were man-made with simple flattening tools does not explain the well-documented plant alterations by electromagnetic effect.
I warned you.
Operation Duty Officer at New River said that Captain Newell signed the log.
When I pressed, he admitted that he never really saw Captain Barnett.
He just assumed he was on the flight line, preflighting.
So Newell took off alone.
Can you fly a Cobra by yourself?
Oh, yes.
Yeah, I'm still here.
Anything unusual in Newell's OQR or his NATOPS jacket?
He's an only child.
Grew up in Florida, just outside Orlando.
Any connection to West Virginia?
No.
His parents died in an auto accident two years ago.
His father sold insurance, and mother was an accountant at Disney World.
Yeah, Gibbs.
You can see Barnett anytime you'd like, Colonel.
Teague?
Good C.O.
Newell went through NROTC at the University of Florida before flight school.
His impulsiveness has gotten him in some trouble.
A fight cost him a non-punitive letter of caution.
That's great.
Last call Captain Newell got on his cell was at 2130 last night.
Hasn't made or received a call since.
His phone is currently off.
Where was the call from?
A pay phone in Smoky Corners, West Virginia.
According to the phone company, this thing hardly ever gets used.
Well, I guess even people out here have cell phones.
We're being watched.
Mm-hmm.
I see.
Sheriff Thompson.
You better get over here.
Find anything?
It's clean.
Too clean.
Not even a smudge.
Yeah, looks like the only thing out here that has been cleaned recently.
Let me have a whack at it.
What's he doing?
Okay.
Get those to Abby for prints.
What are you doing to the phone?
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.
Who are you?
Ritt Everett.
This is my store.
Seen anyone using the phone Tuesday night?
Well, let's see.
Nope.
This have anything to do about that helicopter in the crop circle?
Hello, Sheriff.
Special Agent Gibbs.
Any luck?
Well, sir, luck doesn't have much to do with it.
I've been asking around.
Lot of folks seen them lights and are complaining their animals are acting out of sorts.
How?
Chickens stopped laying eggs.
Cows ain't producing, and stuff like that.
Either of you two seen him around?
No.
Name's Newell.
Captain Todd Newell.
Sorry, ain't seen him.
Newell?
Ain't nobody by that name in the Corners.
I'll keep an eye out for him.
Was he the one flying that helicopter?
Yeah, Gibbs.
Gibbs, I am getting stonewalled here.
By who?
The Air Force.
I requested their file on the 1994 crop circles in Smoky Corners, you'd thought I'd asked them for their missile-launch codes.
Okay, I'll make a call.
No, you don't understand.
They're not going to tell you anything either.
This is like Area 51; it is conspiracy at the highest level.
Abby, stop yourself.
What about the cabin fire?
Gibbs, this is big!
The fire.
Unfortunately, nothing extraterrestrial there;
arson, plain old gasoline was used as an accelerant.
I'm still working on the debris.
Science can't be rushed, Gibbs.
Hi.
You all right?
Yeah, fine.
Ever see him around here?
Your gal going to be okay?
Don't you worry about her.
As long as both sides stick to the story, we'll get through this.
I can't talk right now.
But if you come back at noon, my daddy will be at the VFW in Potterville.
Okay.
Who's that?
The station owner's daughter, Daphne.
I think she wanted to talk, but couldn't.
Her father's having lunch with his buddies at the VFW in Potterville around noon.
She'll be alone.
The dogs are a no-go.
The handlers say something screwed up the dogs.
As soon as they stepped into the woods, they started acting up.
Do not tell Abby.
She's going to make something out of it.
We should start checking the back of their necks for little red Xs.
What are you talking about?
Invaders From Mars.
Wait.
I take it that's a film?
Original 1953 version, not the remake.
Everything's a movie to you, Tony.
Aliens landed in a field just like this one.
Took over the locals' minds, leaving a little red "X" on the back of the necks.
Sounds lame.
Oh, no.
Scariest movie I ever saw.
Especially when this kid tries to tell his mom and dad what's going on, the camera slowly comes around, reveals Xs on the back of Mom and Dad's necks.
Whew.
Scared of my parents for years after that.
I'm sure the feeling was mutual.
Find anything?
Uh, yeah, interviewed half a dozen locals.
Nobody saw or heard a helicopter.
Everyone has the same story.
B.O.L.s.
"Balls of light."
According to Abby, they're created by
Manipulating the atomic particles in the atmosphere.
Mm.
And who does the manipulating, McGee?
I really don't know, sir.
I'm just relating what Abby told me.
I need you to run a tox screen on this tissue sample.
Where'd you get it?
A body exhumed from Arlington.
You look overwhelmed.
I am.
And this just came in from the field.
Gibbs wants me to run prints on it ASAP.
It appears to be to be $1.65.
This poor soul's been dead for 36 years.
I doubt if a few more days will matter.
Thank you, Ducky.
Door handle?
Yeah, it came from a cabin fire.
I found traces of something in it.
I can use a second opinion.
I'm flattered.
Mammalian cells.
Most likely human flesh.
Someone was trapped I that fire.
A missing Marine aviator?
I need to call Gibbs.
Could be his missing aviator is dead.
If he died, where are his remains?
We know the fire was arson.
It started around the same time Newell and his helo disappeared.
Abby was pretty certain somebody was in the cabin.
But we didn't find any remains.
Maybe they got out.
Or someone removed the body.
Until we find remains, I'm not going to connect the dots.
Time to get the cadaver dogs up to aid the search.
Cadaver dogs coming up.
This your cabin, Mr. Clay?
Nope.
No.
My land stops right over there at the treeline there.
Who's it belong to?
Well, nobody, really.
Went to the county after Monroe died.
Who was Monroe?
A farmer from the east side.
Tried working this parcel.
Didn't have no chance, though.
Too hard to clear.
How'd Monroe die?
Hunting.
Accident.
Shack's been abandoned ever since.
I ain't sorry it burned, though.
Kids was always using the place, causing trouble.
Something wrong?
Bet his rk's worse than his bite, huh?
Uh, the bite's actually much worse.
Daphne?
Whatcha lookin' fer?
I need gas.
This way, Missy.
That'll be $6.00.
That's ten.
That's two, that's three, four dollars.
Sure that's all you want?
So, uh... what can State Police do for NCIS?
Well, we're investigating a helicopter incident in Smoky Corners.
Yeah, I heard.
You, uh...?
Sure.
Have a seat.
Met the sheriff.
Oh, Miller Thompson?
Yeah, he wasn't much help.
Well, he doesn't know about enem
But he sure loves wearing that uniform.
You get to Smoky Corners much?
Well, not ss they call.
And they don't.
Hmm.
No crime?
Nothing we get involin.
There's a fights.
Got some kind of feud going on up there.
Goes back decades.
What, like Hatfields and McCoys?
Yeah, something like that.
I honestly donhiny remembers itrted, but it split the valley right down the middle, east versus west, and I was told by my predecessor to stay clear.
Tris, they take careof their own problems.
Have they ever had a murder in Smoky Corners?
I mean, people just di natural causes or, you know, the occasional farm or hunting accident.
Things may have changed.
What's McGee doing out there?
Scanning the field with a magnetometer.
Let me guess Abby?
Her every wish is his command.
She promiso shim her new tattoo.
Wail finds or it ankle.
What did gas station girl tell you?
She was a no-show.
looks like magnet.
You are such a child.
Come on.
Just taking a sip.
It's yours.
Hey, boss.
Abby needs to talk to you.
Abs, you get any sleep?
I am overworked and not paid enough.
Quit.
What do you got?
Two partial prints on the coins from the phone booth.
Any match?
You need to send a thank you to the West Virginia DMV.
The got right index prints from two licensed drivers.
One was the trucker that delivered gasoline to the station, the second was a local, Greg Sikes.
On it.
You get any DNA off the doorknob?
"Nice work on those prints, Abs."
Thank you.
"I know you haven't had a break in two days."
Oh, that's okay.
I don't need much sleep.
Anything for the team.
I assume you'll let me know if you find something.
Don't I always?
Yeah, Abby, you do.
Thank you.
Agent Gibbs.
The cadaver dogs have found something.
Get Ducky.
Smoky Corners bachelor quarters.
Something to be said for living in a trailer.
Get tired of the view, you just roll it to a new location.
Come on, McGee.
What, are you never going to talk to me again?
How long am I going to be the butt of your practical jokes, snide innuendos and juvenile put-downs?
I will always outrank you, probie.
Come on.
Mr. Sikes, NCIS.
Whoa.
Come on in.
Someone left in a hurry.
Huh, no phone.
Ah, nice... teeth.
Duck, what can you tell me?
Uh, not much.
Male, roughly six feet.
Tests I did on femur, clavicle, suggest not that old.
Give me a range.
Mid 20's to 30's.
Oh, this distinctive fracture on the inferior left scapula is consistent with a bullet wound.
Cause of death?
Well, maybe.
Or it could be trauma or asphyxiation.
I don't know if I'll ever be certain.
There's not much to work with, Jethro.
Gibbs!
Yeah?
I used nonisotopic chemiluminescent method to compare the charred DNA to Newell's.
Uh-huh, and?
And it's not his DNA.
But it's damn close.
Oh, come on, Abs.
We're not playing horseshoes.
There's a 99% probability that the fire victim is Newell's male sibling.
That can't be.
Newell's record of emergency data doesn't list a brother.
DNA doesn't lie, Jethro.
People do.
The crispy critter was Captain Newell's brother.
His OQR was wrong?
Recruits lie about things all the timeespecially their age.
Why lie about having a brother?
Is Abby sure?
Yeah, she double checked.
Obviously you two didn't.
We assumed his family history was right.
NCIS agents don't assume anything, Agent Todd.
They check and re-check.
Verify, everything, independently.
We are on it.
There's a definite difference.
I don't see it.
Look at the elongated node.
It's undamaged.
The plants inside the crop circle were changed in a way that is beyond human ability.
I'm rerunning an analysis hoping to find anomalous molecular change to the stalks within the circle.
I'm betting they were subjected to a very short blast of high energy heat, possibly microwave generated.
Rerunning because you came up empty.
Abby, you're looking for something that isn't there.
You've been here for two days straight.
You're tired, you've done everything that
Gibbs has asked, so go home, get some sleep.
I can't sleep.
What are you doing?
You're guilty of confirmation bias.
It's not there, Abs.
You're ignoring the obvious and you're searching for microscopic proof of something that doesn't exist.
Maybe I should join the CIA.
Look at the big picture.
The design of the smaller outer circles was created by bending the corn stalks down in a clockwise direction.
Now look under the helicopter.
Those pants were forced outward from the center by the downdraft of the blades.
The corn was still standing and was forced down by the landing of the Cobra.
Crop circle's a hoax, Abby.
Created, created around a parked helicopter.
Why would anyone do that?
Orange County clerk faxed us his parents marriage certificate.
Todd Newell was nine years old when his mother remarried.
he was legally adopted, that's how he got the Newell name.
His mother's maiden name was Stelling, which is common in Smoky Corners.
First husband's a guy named Sikes.
They had two boys Greg and Todd.
Todd Newell was born in Smoky Corners.
His co-pilot, Captain Barnett, swears that he never
Mentioned a brother or Smoky Corners.
In fact, Barnett couldn't recall Newell ever mentioning anything about his childhood.
We need to find his biological father.
Can't, he died several years ago... in a hunting accident.
Aw, gee, where have I heard that one before?
So we got a dead civilian in Ducky's cooler.
We going to turn it over to the local authorities?
Nope, not yet.
I want to know more, first.
Greg Sikes was involved with the girl at the gas station.
She seemed willing to talk.
Maybe I should go back there and try to find her.
Go with her.
All right, so we're on the same page, right?
I guess, but let me tell Gibbs.
Tell me what?
The crop circle was a hoax, created around the helicopter after it landed.
You don't sound convincing, Abs.
Yeah, well, there's still a lot of stuff that can't be explained.
Like what?
Balls of light in the sky, the animals acting weird, like, a missing pilot.
Everyone's story is exactly the same.
It's too rehearsed.
It's what they want us to hear.
That's exactly what I told her.
But what about the search dogs?
I heard they were acting all confused and disoriented.
Only the first day.
The cadaver dogs had no problem finding the body this morning.
I know why we haven't been able to find Captain Newell.
Thanks, guys.
How do you know?
Because I'm a Marine.
Newell is alive?
Yeah.
Well, who's body did we find?
His brother.
Captain Newell's still out there.
How do you know that?
He received SERE training, Colonel.
He's evading us.
As part of his training he was taught a technique to negate enemy dogs.
Yeah, GS powder, the irritant used in gas mask simulations.
I keep a couple of capsules in my survival vest.
Dogs get a whiff of that, they're useless for days.
He used it on the search dogs.
Now he also has pilot's night-vision goggles and a survival radio to monitor our search frequencies.
Colonel, he's using his Marine Corps training to evade us.
Will you stop that?
You're driving me crazy.
Sorry.
Do I detect a little PMS?
I didn't think that was till next week.
Hey, it's a high-stress job.
You carry a gun.
I need to know when you're not your best.
Sike's trailer is coming up.
Daphne wasn't at the gas station.
If she's not there, I don't know where else to look.
That's Daphne's truck.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey!
Hey!
Daphne, why are you running?
I thought you wanted to talk to us, Daphne.
Daphne, talk to us.
What happened?
What happened?
Are you looking for Greg?
We know he's your boyfriend, that's why we're here looking for you, okay?
Where is he?
Daphne, are you pregnant?
Five months.
Greg's hiding from my daddy.
You know where he is?
Greg's dead, isn't he?
Whatever Newell's brother said to him on the phone got him upset enough to risk his entire careerwith an unauthorized flight in a Cobra.
Boss, you sure you don't want me to drive for a while?
But why land in the farmer's field?
Um, well...
My guess, McGee... it was the closest clearing to the cabin where is brother was hiding, only Newell was too late.
Wh-What?
Focus on the case, McGee.
Sorry, uh, yes, Sir.
Why the crop circle?
Well, uh, I have a theory on that.
You care to share?
Yeah, uh, okay.
Spit it out, McGee.
Okay, uh...
Whoever killed Greg Sikes thought that they could cover it up as another farm or hunting accident.
But they couldn't cover up an attack helicopter abandoned in a corn field.
Conspiracy, huh?
Makes sense.
Take a lot of people to form that pattern in a few hours.
Right, and they knew that there would be an outside investigation, so they created the circle hoping that we'd do exactly what the Air Force did ten years ago back off and cover up what couldn't be explained.
Not bad, McGee.
Not bad.
Where is she?
Inside, she seemed to relate better to Kate.
joy the ride, McGee?
Daphne's father threatened to kill Greg because...
She's pregnant.
Greg and me from different corners of the valley.
God, I hate this rotten place.
This stupid feud.
When'd you last see him?
At the gas station.
Using the payphone to call his brother for help.
Was Greg close to his brother?
He hadn't seen him since they was kids.
About a year ago he got a call telling him their mother died.
It reunited them.
They're the only family either of them have left.
Daphne's afraid that Captain Newell's been drawn back into the feud.
He's gonna kill my daddy to get revenge.
Kate, you and McGee get Daphne out of here.
What's up, boss?
Go for Teague.
Colonel, call off the search.
Pull your men out.
Why?
You said Newell's still out there.
He is.
He wants revenge.
But he's not going to make his move until he thinks we're gone.
They're leaving.
Ritt, we pulled it off.
The Marines have backed off.
This thing's going away.
Nobody's told outsiders nothing.
My problem... is Greg Sikes' brother.
See, I got to get him, 'for he gets me.
This is White Hawk 3-4.
Terminating search.
Returning to base.
3-4 out.
Ritt, think twice about what you're fixing to do.
They ain't got nothing, Ritt.
Just stick to the story.
What's going on?
Looks like y'all are pulling out.
The Marines are, we aren't.
Do you get a kick out of smacking your daughter around?
Why don't you just get out of here?
DiNozzo, read him his rights.
What are you talking about?
The murder of Greg Sikes.
Greg Sikes is dead?
I thought he went hunting.
We found his remains.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Ain't you out of your jurisdiction?
You're the law here, Miller.
Yeah, I am.
Don't get excited, Sheriff.
The West Virginia State Police are on their way, but I do have the authority to detain both of you until they arrive.
We, too, have guns.
White man has more guns and more warriors.
We need one of your people to guide us through the mountains.
Gibbs, I have a bogey.
In the trees, closing in from the northwest.
Everybody copy.
Yeah, boss.
Got it.
He slipped behind the old cars.
Let him get closer.
Roger that.
Oh, man.
He made me.
Hit the lights!
NCIS!
Lower your weapon,
Captain Newell!
It's over.
It's not over till Ritt Everett's dead.
He's in the custody of the State Police.
That's not going to change anything.
It's an eye-for-an-eye here, always has been.
Is that why your mother took you away?
Put down your weapon.
Why?
I'm never going to fly again.
No, your career's probably over, but you haven't hurt anybody yet.
Keep it that way, and I'll do everything I can to help you.
There is a young girl carrying your brother's baby
and they could sure use your help.
Once we left, it was like Smoky Corners never existed.
My mother erased it from our lives.
I always felt guilty she had to leave Greg behind, but our father wouldn't let her have both of us.
Why'd you take the Cobra?
It's fierce, intimidating.
I hoped it would scare the crap out of those hicks, save Greg's life.
And I was too late.
The cabin was in flames, Greg trapped inside.
Everett and the others started shooting at me and I got hit.
And they had hunting rifles, I only had my pistol.
I was cut off from the helo, couldn't get back to the base.
I knew my Marine Corps career was over.
All that was left for me was revenge.
Wow, those are really pretty, Kate.
Where are they from?
Tony.
We had a tough couple of days.
Kate pointed out that I'd taken one too many liberties.
The flowers are a mea culpa.
Tony, I'm blown away.
They're gorgeous.
And they're from Martha's Garden, my favorite florist.
How'd you know?
Lucky guess.
He went through your purse and got the phone number off your PDA.
Most people tend to their personal hygiene at home.
This bothers you?
No, what bothers me is that it doesn't bother me anymore.
I'm an acquired taste.
Actually it's more like the Stockholm syndrome.
The emotional attachment to a captor formed by a hostage as a result of continuous stress and a need to cooperate for survival.
- Nice shot.
- Get the truck.
- Where we going, boss?
- Smoky Corners, West Virginia.
A Marine helo was found abandoned.
- Crew's missing.
- Any leads?
You tell me.
It's sitting in the middle of a crop circle.
Abby's gonna make us crazy.
Come on, let's go!
I don't believe it.
They never make it easy.
Lieutenant Colonel Curtis Teague, Squadron C.O., HMLA-167.
Gibbs, NCIS.
Colonel, your people have contaminated the scene.
I'm missing two men, Gibbs.
I wasn't gonna sit on my ass and wait for NCIS to drive out from Washington.
Yeah, well, we're going to have to take elimination prints from all your people.
Stand down, men!
- Let NCIS do their job.
- Stand down!
- Any damage to the aircraft?
- No, the engine checks out.
Hydraulic and avionics gear are operative, fuel load's at 60%.
When was your last contact with the crew?
They took off from New River at 2300 on a routine night proficiency flight, were cleared to a practise area over Chesapeake Bay.
Flight controller lost the transponder signal 10 minutes out.
Tried to make radio contact.
Never got a response.
- I was notified a half hour later.
- How'd you find it?
We were organising to launch a search and rescue mission when I got a call from the local sheriff.
The farmer that owns this field discovered it just after sunrise.
- DiNozzo!
- Yeah, boss.
Sketch and shoot.
Kate, the cockpit.
Trace evidence, bag and tag.
McGee, the field.
Lay out a grid.
Got it.
We just started the air search.
Hopefully we'll find them.
I'm ignoring the fact that my aircraft is in the middle of a crop circle.
What about you, Agent Gibbs?
What are your thoughts?
Do I think your men were abducted by aliens, Colonel?
No, I don't.
But I'm not going to ignore anything.
- I need an overhead view of the field.
- I already took digital photos.
- Sergeant Ramos!
- Sir.
Camera.
Who are the missing men?
Pilot is Captain Todd Newell.
Co-pilot, Captain Patrick Barnett.
Good Marines.
But they're young pilots, hot shots.
The two are close.
They share an apartment off base.
I'll need their officer qualification records and NATOPS jackets.
McGee!
Yeah, boss?
The shots of the crop circle, e-mail them to Abby.
Abby?
Are you certain you want to do that?
You know she's obsessed with the paranormal and...
Right.
I'm on it.
I do not want UFO freaks crawling around here, Colonel.
Let's keep a lid on this.
No releases to the media.
Agreed.
I should've been an aviator.
These things are chick magnets.
I hate helicopters.
They're loud, uncomfortable and dangerous.
I used to dread getting on Marine One with the President.
- Oh, Tony!
- What?
You are getting way too comfortable around me.
Okay, clipping your nails is one thing, but that, that is crossing the line.
- Come on.
- No, I'm serious.
I have had enough of your locker-room mentality.
I would be upset if someone I was dating, dating took such familiarities.
Well, we work together.
So feel free to scratch or adjust anything you like in front of me.
I'm always up before the sun.
It's only 30 acres, but it's a lot of work.
You didn't hear anything last night?
Nothing.
So, how long you think it's gonna be before they get that thing out of here?
I got work to do.
What do you think happened to your field?
You're asking me?
Ask the Air Force.
This ain't the first crop circle here.
We had one in 1994.
The Air Force investigated, but we never did get no answers.
There was lights back then, too.
- Lights?
- Lit up the sky last night.
They woke me up.
It wasn't lightning.
There was no thunder.
Like I told you, I didn't hear anything.
I just tried to put it out of my mind until I discovered this.
We may have more questions for you, Mr Clay.
I ain't going nowhere.
Well, I guess I should ask around, see if anybody else seen something.
How long you been sheriff?
Couple of years now.
Your full-time job?
I also run the grain and feed store.
McGee, you are turning me on!
It's very Glastonbury, circa 1980s.
I mean, not quite as large or elaborate, but it's a fascinating pictogram.
- I'm not familiar with Glastonbury.
- Southern England.
Where most of the crop circles were found.
Abby, they're hoaxes.
You have to admit, they are interesting.
Yeah, actually I put them right up there with Tarot cards and telephone psychics.
I thought two farmers admitted to creating them.
Well, yeah, but there's been over 10,000 reported all over the world.
There's no way those two did them all.
Abby, nothing paranormal happened here.
Yeah, there was no damage to the helicopter, yet the entire crew vanished.
You can't take crop circles seriously.
You're a scientist.
There's a logical explanation.
Listen to me, McGee.
I need pictures.
And lots of them.
And specimens of stalks down to the roots.
And a core sample of soil, at least 12 inches.
And make sure you get a control sample from outside the circle.
Abby, we're looking for two missing Marines.
Come on, McGee!
Do it for me, please.
I'll show you my new tat.
The replacement crew's ready to fly the Cobra back to New River.
- Go ahead.
We got everything we need.
- You're clear to go.
Do we really need all this stuff?
I'm only following instructions.
Ask Abby.
All right.
McGee and I will take the truck back.
You two check out the pilots' apartment.
Right.
I'll try not to be too familiar, Miss Todd.
Hey, get the scent articles for the search dogs.
Okay.
What is it, boss?
I was worried about keeping a lid on this thing.
Where are the gawkers?
You see any locals other than the farmer who owns this field and the sheriff?
Special Agent Gibbs.
The Huey spotted a burnt-out area just north of here.
You might want to come with us.
You think this has something to do with my crew?
I don't know, but we're gonna find out.
We've got another scene to process.
So, we're looking for anything that suggests they didn't just leave on a routine flight.
Thanks for explaining, Special Agent DiNozzo.
Oh, my God!
I don't believe it!
Do you know what this is?
This is a classic.
December '92.
Pamela's debut.
I lost my copy.
Lost it or wore it out?
We need to get the scent articles for the dogs.
What the hell are you doing in my apartment?
NCIS!
Let her go!
I understand you're not cooperating, Captain Barnett.
I don't know anything.
It's Saturday night.
I was at my girlfriend's.
Got home, just getting out of the shower and I heard someone in my apartment.
Where is Captain Newell?
I don't know.
You were scheduled for a proficiency flight at 2300 last night.
Did you take it?
What's the flight schedule say, sir?
Well, it says right here, Newell and you took off from New River.
Then we did.
Here's how it works, ace.
I ask the questions, you give direct answers.
Did you take the flight?
I think Gibbs enjoys this more than sex.
That would explain the three wives.
Your Cobra was found abandoned 150 miles from where it was supposed to be, and Newell is missing.
- What is Gibbs doing?
- TBI.
Excuse me?
Truth by intimidation.
In five, four, three, two, one.
We were leaving for the base when Todd got a call on his cell.
He took it into the bedroom.
When he came out, he was messed up.
He said he wasn't feeling well and wanted to call the Squadron Deputy Officer in Ops to cancel the hop.
Who made the call?
- I don't know.
- I don't believe you, Barnett.
You live together, you fly together, you fight together.
- You share everything.
- I thought we did.
Look, I rode his ass to figure out what was going on.
But Todd, he got really pissed.
He told me to lay low for the rest of the night.
He didn't want me getting in trouble.
And you let it go at that?
Todd said he'd explain when he got back.
I believe him.
Sign it.
- What did Gibbs whisper in his ear?
- Lf I knew, I'd be Gibbs.
I'm gonna go pull Captain Newell's cell records.
Did you feel an energy when you were inside the circle, McGee?
Did you get a tingling sensation or start to vibrate?
You're gonna start to vibrate if you don't do what Gibbs wants.
I'm running tests on the molecular structure of plants from within and outside the circle.
Okay, Abby, Gibbs made it clear.
The priority is the cabin fire.
You know, people try to imitate the real thing, but the notion that all recorded formations were man-made with simple flattening tools does not explain the well-documented plant alterations by electromagnetic effect.
I warned you.
Operation Duty Officer at New River said that Captain Newell signed the log.
When I pressed, he admitted that he never really saw Captain Barnett.
He just assumed that he was on the flight line, pre-flighting.
So Newell took off alone?
Can you fly a Cobra by yourself?
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah, I'm still here.
Anything unusual in Newell's OQR or his NATOPS jacket?
He's an only child, grew up in Florida, just outside Orlando.
- Any connection to West Virginia?
- No.
His parents died in an auto accident two years ago.
His father sold insurance, and mother was an accountant at Disney World.
Yeah, Gibbs.
Well, you can see Barnett anytime you'd like, Colonel.
Teague?
Good CO.
Newell went through NROTC at the University of Florida before flight school.
His impulsiveness has gotten him in some trouble.
A fight cost him a non-punitive letter of caution.
That's great.
Last call Captain Newell got on his cell was at 2130 last night.
He hasn't made or received a call since.
His phone is currently off.
Where was the call from?
A pay phone in Smoky Corners, West Virginia.
According to the phone company, this thing hardly ever gets used.
Well, I guess even people out here have cell phones.
- We're being watched.
- I see.
Now you better get over here.
- Find anything?
- It's clean.
Too clean.
Not even a smudge.
Yeah, looks like the only thing out here that has been cleaned recently.
Let me have a whack at it.
What's he doing?
Okay.
Get those to Abby for prints.
What are you doing to the phone?
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.
Who are you?
Ritt Everett.
This is my store.
Seen anyone using the phone Tuesday night?
Well, nope.
Does this have anything to do about that helicopter in the crop circle?
Hello, Sheriff.
Special Agent Gibbs.
Any luck?
Well, sir, luck doesn't have much to do with it.
I've been asking around.
Lot of folks seen them lights and are complaining their animals are acting out of sorts.
How?
Chickens stopped laying eggs.
Cows ain't producing, and stuff like that.
Either of you two seen him around?
No.
His name's Newell.
Captain Todd Newell.
No, I'm sorry.
Ain't seen him.
Newell?
Ain't nobody by that name in the Corners.
I'll keep an eye out for him.
Was he the one flying that helicopter?
- Yeah, Gibbs.
- Gibbs!
I am getting stonewalled here.
- By whom?
- The Air Force.
I requested their file on the 1994 crop circles in Smoky Corners.
You'd thought I asked them for their missile launch codes.
- Okay, I'll make a call, Abs.
- No, you don't understand.
They're not going to tell you anything either.
This is like Area 51.
It is conspiracy at the highest level.
Abby, stop yourself.
What about the cabin fire?
Gibbs, this is big.
The fire.
Unfortunately, nothing extra-terrestrial there.
Arson.
Plain old gasoline was used as an accelerant.
I'm still working on the debris.
Science can't be rushed, Gibbs.
Hi!
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Ever seen him around here?
Is your gal gonna be okay?
Don't you worry about her.
As long as both sides stick to the story, we'll get through this.
I can't talk right now.
But if you come back at noon, my daddy will be at the VFW in Potterville.
Okay.
Who's that?
The station owner's daughter, Daphne.
I think she wanted to talk but couldn't.
Her father's having lunch with his buddies at the VFW in Potterville around noon.
She'll be alone.
The dogs are a no go.
The handlers say something screwed up the dogs.
Soon as they stepped into the woods, they started acting up.
Do not tell Abby.
She's going to make something out of it.
We should start checking the back of their necks for little red X's.
What are you talking about?
Invaders from Mars.
Wait, I take it that's a film?
Original 1953 version, not the remake.
Everything's a movie to you, Tony.
Aliens landed in a field just like this one.
They took over the locals' minds, leaving a little red X on the back of their necks.
- Sounds lame.
- Oh, no!
Scariest movie I ever saw.
Especially when this kid tries to tell his mom and dad what's going on.
The camera slowly comes around reveals X's on the back of Mom and Dad's necks.
I was scared of my parents for years after that.
- I'm sure the feeling was mutual.
- Find anything?
Yeah.
Interviewed a half dozen locals.
Nobody saw or heard a helicopter.
- Everyone has the same story.
- bois.
Balls of light.
According to Abby they are created by manipulating the atomic particles in the atmosphere.
And who does the manipulating, McGee?
I really don't know, sir.
I'm just relating what Abby told me.
I need you to run a tox screen on this tissue sample.
- Where'd you get it?
- A body exhumed from Arlington.
- Oh, you look overwhelmed.
- I am.
And this just came in from the field.
Gibbs wants me to run prints on it ASAP.
It appears to be $1.65.
Well, this poor soul's been dead for 36 years.
I doubt a few more days will matter.
Thank you, Ducky.
- Door handle?
- Yeah.
It came from a cabin fire.
I found traces of something on it.
And I could use a second opinion.
Oh, I'm flattered.
Mammalian cells.
Most likely human flesh.
Someone was trapped in that fire.
The missing Marine aviator?
I need to call Gibbs.
Could be his missing aviator is dead.
If he died, where are his remains?
We know the fire was arson.
It started around the same time Newell and his helo disappeared.
Abby is pretty certain someone was in the cabin.
But we didn't find any remains.
Maybe they got out.
Or someone removed the body.
Well, until we find remains, I'm not going to connect the dots.
Time to get cadaver dogs up here to aid the search.
Cadaver dogs coming up.
- This your cabin, Mr Clay?
- No.
No.
My land stops right over there at the tree line there.
- Who's it belong to?
- Well, nobody really.
It went to the county after Monroe died.
Who was Monroe?
A farmer from the east side.
Tried working this parcel.
Didn't have no chance, though.
Too hard to clear.
How did Monroe die?
Hunting, an accident.
Shack's been abandoned ever since.
I ain't sorry it burnt, though.
Kids was always using the place, causing trouble.
Is something wrong?
I bet his bark's worse than his bite, huh?
The bite's actually much worse.
Daphne?
What you looking for?
I need gas.
This way, missy.
That'll be $6.
That's $10.
That's $2, $3, $4.
Sure that's all you want?
So, what can State Police do for NCIS?
Well, we're investigating a helicopter incident in Smoky Corners.
Yeah, I heard.
You...
- Sure.
- Have a seat.
- Met the Sheriff.
- Old Miller Thompson?
Yeah.
Yeah, he wasn't much help.
Hell, he doesn't know jack about law enforcement, but he sure loves wearing that uniform.
Do you get to Smoky Corners much?
Well, not unless they call, and they don't.
No crime?
Nothing we get involved in.
There's a few fights.
There's been some kind of feud going on up there.
It goes back decades.
What, like Hatfields and McCoys?
Yeah, something like that.
You know, I honestly don't think anyone remembers how it started.
It split the valley down the middle, east versus west.
And I was told by my predecessor to stay clear.
Truth is, they take care of their own problems.
Have they ever had a murder in Smoky Corners?
Not that I know of.
I mean, people just die of natural causes or the occasional farm or hunting accident.
Things may have changed.
What's McGee doing out there?
Scanning the field with a magnetometer.
Let me guess.
Abby?
Her every wish is his command.
She promised to show him her new tattoo.
Wait till he finds out it's on her ankle.
What did gas station girl tell you?
She was a no-show.
Looks like he found something.
- You are such a child.
- Come on.
Just taking a sip.
It's yours.
Hey, boss.
Abby needs to talk to you.
Abs, did you get any sleep?
I am overworked and not paid enough.
Quit.
What do you got?
Two partial prints on the coins from the phone booth.
Any match?
You need to send a thank you to the West Virginia DMV.
They got right index prints from two licenced drivers.
One was a trucker that delivered gasoline to the station.
- The second was a local.
Greg Sikes.
- On it.
Were you able to get any DNA off the doorknob, Abs?
Nice work on those prints, Abs.
Thank you.
I know you haven't had a break in two days.
Oh, that's okay.
I don't need much sleep.
Anything for the team.
I assume you'll let me know if you find something.
Don't I always?
Yeah, Abby, you do.
Thank you.
Agent Gibbs, the cadaver dogs have found something.
Get Ducky.
Smoky Corners bachelor quarters.
There's something to be said for living in a trailer.
Get tired of the view, you just roll it to a new location.
Come on, McGee.
What, are you never gonna talk to me again?
How long am I going to be the butt of your practical jokes, snide innuendoes and juvenile put-downs?
I will always outrank you, probie.
Come on.
Mr Sikes, NCIS.
Oh!
Come on in.
Someone left in a hurry.
No phone.
Nice teeth.
Duck, what can you tell me?
Not much.
Male, roughly six feet.
Tests I did on the femur, clavicle suggests not that old.
- Give me a range.
- Mid 20's to 30's.
Oh, this distinctive fracture on the inferior left scapula
- is consistent with a bullet wound.
- Cause of death?
Well, maybe.
I mean, it could be trauma or asphyxiation.
I don't know if I'll ever be certain.
I mean, there's not much to work with, Jethro.
- Gibbs!
- Yeah?
I used non-isotopic chemi-luminescent method to compare the charred DNA to Newell's.
- And?
- And it's not his DNA.
But it's damn close.
Come on, Abs.
We're not playing horseshoes.
There's a 99% probability that the fire victim is Newell's male sibling.
That can't be.
Newell's record of emergency data doesn't list a brother.
DNA doesn't lie, Jethro.
People do.
The crispy critter was Captain Newell's brother.
His OQR was wrong?
Recruits lie about things all the time, especially their age.
Why lie about having a brother?
Is Abby sure?
Yeah.
She double-checked.
Obviously you two didn't.
We just assumed that his family history was right.
NCIS agents don't assume anything, Agent Todd.
They check and recheck.
Verify everything independently.
We are on it!
- There is a definite difference.
- I don't see it.
Look at the elongated node.
It's undamaged.
The plants inside the crop circle were changed in a way that is beyond human ability.
I'm rerunning an analysis hoping to find an anomalous molecular change to the stalks within the circle.
I'm betting they were subjected to very short blasts of high energy heat, possibly microwave generated.
Re-running because you came up empty.
Look, Abby, you're looking for something that isn't there.
Okay, you've been here for two days straight.
You're tired.
And you've done everything that Gibbs has asked.
So go home, get some sleep.
I can't sleep!
- What are you doing?
- You're guilty of confirmation bias.
It's not there, Abs.
You're ignoring the obvious and you're searching for microscopic proof of something that doesn't exist.
Maybe I should join the CIA.
Look at the big picture.
The design of the smaller, outer circles was created by bending the corn stalks down in a clockwise direction.
But look under the helicopter.
Those plants were forced outward from the centre by the downdraught of the blades.
The corn was still standing and was forced down by the landing of the Cobra.
This crop circle is a hoax, Abby.
It was created...
It was created around a parked helicopter.
Why would anyone do that?
Orange County clerk faxed us his parents' marriage certificate.
Todd Newell was nine years old when his mother remarried.
He was legally adopted.
That's how he got the Newell name.
His mother's maiden name was Stelling, which is common in Smoky Corners.
Her first husband was a guy named Sikes.
They had two boys, Greg and Todd.
Todd Newell was born in Smoky Corners.
His co-pilot, Captain Barnett, swears that he never mentioned a brother or Smoky Corners.
In fact, Barnett couldn't recall Newell ever mentioning anything about his childhood.
We need to find his biological father.
Can't.
He died several years ago in a hunting accident.
Gee, where have I heard that one before?
So we got a dead civilian in Ducky's cooler.
Are we going to turn it over to the local authorities?
Nope.
Not yet.
I want to know more first.
Greg Sikes was involved with the girl at the gas station.
She was the only one that seemed willing to talk.
Maybe I should go back there and try to find her.
Go with her.
All right, so we're on the same page, right?
- I guess, but let me tell Gibbs.
- Tell me what?
The crop circle was a hoax created around the helicopter after it landed.
You don't sound convincing, Abs.
Yeah, well there's still a lot of stuff that can't be explained.
Like what?
Balls of light in the sky.
The animals acting weird.
Like a missing pilot.
Everyone's story is exactly the same.
It's too rehearsed.
It's what they want us to hear.
- That's exactly what I told her.
- And what about the search dogs?
I heard they were acting all confused and disoriented.
Only the first day.
The cadaver dogs had no problem finding the body this morning.
I know why we haven't been able to find Captain Newell.
Thanks, guys.
How do you know?
Because I'm a Marine.
- Newell is alive?
- Yeah.
Well, whose body did we find?
His brother.
Captain Newell is still out there.
- How do you know that?
- He received SERE training, Colonel.
He's evading us.
As part of his training, he was taught a technique to negate enemy dogs.
Yeah, GS powder.
Irritant used in gas mask simulations.
I keep a couple of capsules in my survival vest.
Dogs get a whiff of that, they're useless for days.
He used it on the search dogs.
Now he also has pilot's night vision goggles and a survival radio to monitor our search frequencies.
Colonel, he's using his Marine Corps training to evade us.
Will you stop that?
You're driving me crazy!
Sorry.
Do I detect a little PMS?
I didn't think that was till next week.
Hey, it's a high stress job.
You carry a gun.
I need to know when you're not at your best.
Sikes' trailer is coming up.
Daphne wasn't at the gas station.
If she's not there, I don't know where else to look.
That's Daphne's truck.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Daphne, why are you running?
I thought you wanted to talk to us.
Daphne!
Daphne, talk to us!
What happened?
What happened?
- Are you looking for Greg?
- We know he's your boyfriend.
That's why we're here looking for you, okay?
Where is he?
Daphne, are you pregnant?
Five months.
Greg's hiding from my daddy.
Do you know where he is?
Greg's dead, isn't he?
Whatever Newell's brother said to him on the phone got him upset enough to risk his entire career with an unauthorized flight in the Cobra.
Boss, are you sure you don't want me to drive for a while?
But why land in the farmer's field?
Oh, well...
My guess, McGee, it was the closest clearing to the cabin where his brother was hiding, only Newell was too late.
- What?
- Focus on the case, McGee.
Sorry.
Yes, sir.
Why the crop circle?
Well, I have a theory on that.
You care to share?
Yeah, okay.
- Spit it out, McGee.
- Okay.
Whoever killed Greg Sikes thought that they could cover it up as another farm or hunting accident.
But they couldn't cover up an attack helicopter abandoned in a corn field.
Conspiracy, huh?
Makes sense.
Take a lot of people to form that pattern in a few hours.
They knew that there would be an outside investigation.
So they created the circle hoping that we would do exactly what the Air Force did 10 years ago.
Back off and cover up what couldn't be explained.
Not bad, McGee.
Not bad.
- Where is she?
- Inside.
She seemed to relate better to Kate.
Enjoy the ride, McGee?
Daphne's father threatened to kill Greg
- because she's pregnant.
- Pregnant.
Greg and me are from different corners in the valley.
God, I hate this rotten place.
This stupid feud.
When was the last time you saw him?
At the gas station, using the pay phone to call his brother for help.
Was Greg close to his brother?
He ain't seen him since they was kids.
About a year ago he got a call telling him their mother died.
It reunited them.
They're the only family either of them had left.
Daphne's afraid that Captain Newell's been drawn back into the feud.
He's gonna kill my daddy to get revenge.
Kate, you and McGee get Daphne out of here.
What's up, boss?
Call for Teague.
Colonel, call off the search.
Pull your men out.
Why?
You said Newell was still out there.
He is.
He wants revenge.
But he's not gonna make his move until he thinks we're gone.
They're leaving.
Ritt, we've pulled it off.
The Marines have backed off.
This thing's going away.
Nobody's told outsiders nothing.
My problem is Greg Sikes' brother.
You see, I gotta get him before he gets me.
This is White Hawk 34, terminating search, returning to base.
34 out.
Ritt, think twice about what you're fixing to do.
They ain't got nothing, Ritt.
Just stick to the story.
- What's going on?
- Looks like you all pulling out.
The Marines are, we aren't.
Do you get a kick out of smacking your daughter around?
Why don't you just get out of here?
DiNozzo, read him his rights.
What are you talking about?
The murder of Greg Sikes.
Greg Sikes is dead?
I thought he went hunting.
We found his remains.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Ain't you out of your jurisdiction?
You're the law here, Miller.
- Yeah, I am.
- Don't get excited, Sheriff.
The West Virginia State Police are on their way.
But I do have the authority to detain both of you until they arrive.
Gibbs, I have a bogey.
In the trees.
Closing in from the northwest.
Everybody copy?
- Yeah, boss.
- Got it.
He slipped behind the old cars.
- Let him get closer.
- Roger that.
Oh, man.
- He made me.
- Hit the lights!
NCIS!
Lower your weapon, Captain Newell!
It's over.
It's not over until Ritt Everett's dead.
He's in the custody of the state police.
That's not going to change anything.
It's an eye for an eye here.
Always has been.
Is that why your mother took you away?
Put down your weapon.
Why?
I'm never gonna fly again.
Well, your career is probably over, but you haven't hurt anybody yet.
Keep it that way and I'll do everything I can to help you.
There is a young girl carrying your brother's baby.
And they could sure use your help.
Once we left, it was like Smoky Corners never existed.
My mother erased it from our lives.
I always felt guilty she had to leave Greg behind, but our father wouldn't let her have both of us.
Why did you take the Cobra?
It's fierce.
Intimidating.
I hoped it would scare the crap out of those hicks and save Greg's life.
But I was too late.
The cabin was in flames,
Greg trapped inside.
Everett and the others started shooting at me and I got hit.
They had hunting rifles.
All I had was my pistol.
I was cut off from the helo, couldn't get back to the base.
I knew my Marine Corps career was over.
All that was left for me was revenge.
Wow, those are really pretty, Kate.
Who are they from?
Tony.
We had a tough couple of days.
Kate pointed out that I'd taken one too many liberties.
The flowers are a mea culpa.
Tony, I'm blown away.
They're gorgeous.
And they're from Martha's Garden, my favourite florist!
How did you know?
Lucky guess.
He went through your purse and got the phone number off your PDA.
Most people tend to their personal hygiene at home.
This bothers you?
No, what bothers me is that it doesn't bother me anymore.
I'm an acquired taste.
Actually, it's more like the Stockholm syndrome.
The emotional attachment to a captor formed by hostages are result of continuous stress and a need to cooperate for survival.
Nice shot.
Get the truck.
Where we going, boss?
Smoky Corners, West Virginia.
Marine helo was found abandoned.
-Crew's missing.
-Any leads?
You tell me.
It's sitting in the middle of a crop circle.
Abby's going to make us crazy.
Come on, let's go.
I don't believe it.
They never make it easy.
Lieutenant Colonel Curtis Teague.
Squadron CO.
HMLA 167.
Gibbs.
NCIS.
Colonel, your people have contaminated the scene.
I'm missing two men, Gibbs.
Wasn't going to sit on my ass and wait for NCIS to drive out from Washington.
Yeah, well, we're going to have to take elimination prints from all your people.
Let NCIS do their job.
Stand down.
Any damage to the aircraft?
No.
The engine checks out.
Hydraulic and avionics gear are operative.
Fuel load's at 60 percent.
When was your last contact with the crew?
They took off from New River at 2300 on a routine night proficiency flight.
Were cleared to a practice area over Chesapeake Bay.
Flight controller lost the transponder signal ten minutes out.
Tried to make radio contact, never got a response.
I was notified a half hour later.
How'd you find it?
We were organizing to launch a search and rescue mission when I got a call from the local sheriff.
The farmer that owns this field discovered it just after sunrise.
DiNozzo.
Yeah, boss?
Sketch and shoot.
Kate, the cockpit.
Trace evidence, bag and tag.
-McGee, the field.
Lay out a grid.
-Got it.
We just started the air search.
Hopefully we'll find them.
I'm ignoring the fact that my aircraft is in the middle of a crop circle.
What about you, Agent Gibbs, what are your thoughts?
Do I think your men were abducted by aliens, Colonel?
No.
I don't, but I'm not going to ignore anything.
I need an overhead view of the field.
Already took digital photos.
Sergeant Ramos!
Sir.
Camera.
Who are the missing men?
Pilot is Captain Todd Newell.
Co-pilot Captain Patrick Barnett.
Good marines.
But they're young pilots.
Hot shots.
The two are close.
They share an apartment off base.
I need their Officer Qualification Records and NATOPS jackets.
McGee!
Yeah, boss?
Shots of the crop circle.
E-mail them to Abby.
Abby?
You certain you want to do that?
You know, she's obsessed with the paranormal and...
Right.
I'm on it.
I do not want UFO freaks crawling around here, Colonel.
Let's keep a lid on this.
No releases to the media.
Agreed.
I should've been an aviator.
These things are chick magnets.
I hate helicopters.
They're loud, uncomfortable and dangerous.
Used to dread getting on Marine One with the President.
Ew.
Tony...
What?
You're getting way too comfortable around me.
Okay, clipping your nails is one thing, but that, that is crossing the line.
Come on.
No, I'm serious.
I've had enough of your locker room mentality.
I would be upset if someone I was dating dating took such familiarities.
Well, we work together.
So feel free to scratch or adjust anything you like in front of me.
I'm always up before the sun.
It's only 30 acres, but it's a lot of work.
You didn't hear anything last night?
Nothing.
So how long you think it's gonna be before they get that thing out of here?
I got work to do.
What do you think happened to your field?
You're asking me?
Ask the Air Force.
This isn't the first crop circle here.
We had one in 1994.
The Air Force investigated, but we never did get no answers.
There were lights back then, too.
Lights?
Lit up the sky last night.
Woke me up.
It wasn't lightning.
There was no thunder.
Like I told you, I didn't hear anything.
Just tried to put it out of my mind till I discovered this.
We may have more questions for you, Mr. Clay.
I ain't going nowhere.
Well, guess I should ask around.
See if anybody else seen something.
How long you been sheriff?
Couple years now.
Your full-time job?
I also run the grain and feed store.
Whoa.
McGee, you are turning me on.
It's very Glastonbury, circa 1980s.
I mean, not quite as large or elaborate, but it's a fascinating pictogram.
I'm not familiar with Glastonbury.
Southern England?
Where most of the crop circles were found?
Abby, they're hoaxes.
You have to admit they are interesting.
Yeah, I put them right up there with tarot cards and telephone psychics.
Thought two farmers admitted to creating them.
Yeah, but there's been over 10,000 reported all over the world.
There's no way those two did them all.
Abby, nothing paranormal happened here.
Yeah, there was no damage to the helicopter, yet the entire crew vanished.
You can't take crop circles seriously, you're a scientist.
There's a logical explanation.
Listen to me, McGee.
I need pictures, and lots of them.
And specimens of the stalks down to the roots.
And a core sample of soil, at least 12 inches.
Make sure you get a control sample from outside the circle.
Abby, we're looking for two missing marines.
Come on, McGee.
Do it for me, please?
I'll show you my new tat.
The replacement crew is ready to fly the Cobra back to New River.
Go ahead, we got everything we need.
Clear to go.
Do we really need all this stuff?
Just following instructions.
Ask Abby.
All right, McGee and I will take the truck back.
You two, check out the pilots' apartment.
Right.
I'll try not to be too familiar, Ms. Todd.
Hey, get the scent articles for the search dog.
Okay.
What is it, boss?
I was worried about keeping a lid on this thing.
Where are the gawkers?
You see any locals other than the farmer who owns this field and the sheriff?
Special Agent Gibbs.
The Huey spotted a burnt-out area just north of here.
You might want to come with us.
You think this has something to do with my crew?
I don't know, but we're going to find out.
We've got another scene to process.
So, we're looking for anything that suggests they didn't just leave on a routine flight.
Thanks for explaining, Special Agent DiNozzo.
Oh, my God, I don't believe it.
Do you know what this is?
This is a classic.
December '92.
Pamela's debut.
I lost my copy.
Lost it or wore it out?
We need to get scent articles for the dogs.
What the hell are you doing in my apartment?
NCIS.
Let her go.
I understand you're not cooperating, Captain Barnett.
I don't know anything.
It's Saturday night.
I was at my girlfriend's.
Got home, just getting out of the shower and I heard someone in my apartment.
Where's Captain Newell?
I don't know.
You were scheduled for a proficiency flight at 2300 last night.
Did you take it?
What's the flight schedule say, sir?
Well, it says right here Newell and you took off from New River.
Then we did.
Here's how it works, ace.
I ask the questions, you give direct answers.
Did you take the flight?
I think Gibbs enjoys this more than sex.
That would explain the three wives.
Your Cobra was found abandoned 150 miles from where it was supposed to be and Newell is missing.
What is Gibbs doing?
TBI.
Excuse me?
Truth by intimidation.
In five... four... three... two... one.
We were leaving for the base when Todd got a call on his cell.
He took it into the bedroom.
When he came out... he was messed up.
He said he wasn't feeling well and wanted to call the Squadron Deputy
Officer in Ops to cancel the hop.
Who made the call?
I don't know.
I don't believe you, Barnett.
You live together, you fly together, you fight together, you share everything.
I thought we did.
Look, I rode his ass to figure out what was going on, but Todd, he got really pissed.
Told me to lay low for the rest of the night.
He didn't want me getting in trouble.
And you let it go at that?
Todd said he'd explain when he got back.
I believe him.
Sign it.
What did Gibbs whisper in his ear?
If I knew, I'd be Gibbs.
I'm gonna go pull Captain Newell's cell records.
Did you feel an energy when you were inside the circle, McGee?
Did you get a tingling sensation or start to vibrate?
You're gonna vibrate if you don't do what Gibbs wants.
I'm running tests on the molecular structure of plants from within and outside the circle.
Okay, Abby, Gibbs made it clear the priority is the cabin fire.
You know, people try to imitate the real thing, but the notion that all recorded formations were man-made with simple flattening tools does not explain the well-documented plant alterations by electromagnetic effect.
I warned you.
Operation Duty Officer at New River said that Captain Newell signed the log.
When I pressed, he admitted that he never really saw Captain Barnett.
He just assumed he was on the flight line, preflighting.
So Newell took off alone.
Can you fly a Cobra by yourself?
Oh, yes.
Yeah, I'm still here.
Anything unusual in Newell's OQR or his NATOPS jacket?
He's an only child.
Grew up in Florida, just outside Orlando.
Any connection to West Virginia?
No.
His parents died in an auto accident two years ago.
His father sold insurance, and mother was an accountant at Disney World.
Yeah, Gibbs.
You can see Barnett anytime you'd like, Colonel.
Teague?
Good C.O.
Newell went through NROTC at the University of Florida before flight school.
His impulsiveness has gotten him in some trouble.
A fight cost him a non-punitive letter of caution.
That's great.
Last call Captain Newell got on his cell was at 2130 last night.
Hasn't made or received a call since.
His phone is currently off.
Where was the call from?
A pay phone in Smoky Corners, West Virginia.
According to the phone company, this thing hardly ever gets used.
Well, I guess even people out here have cell phones.
We're being watched.
Mm-hmm.
I see.
Sheriff Thompson.
You better get over here.
Find anything?
It's clean.
Too clean.
Not even a smudge.
Yeah, looks like the only thing out here that has been cleaned recently.
Let me have a whack at it.
What's he doing?
Okay.
Get those to Abby for prints.
What are you doing to the phone?
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.
Who are you?
Ritt Everett.
This is my store.
Seen anyone using the phone Tuesday night?
Well, let's see.
Nope.
This have anything to do about that helicopter in the crop circle?
Hello, Sheriff.
Special Agent Gibbs.
Any luck?
Well, sir, luck doesn't have much to do with it.
I've been asking around.
Lot of folks seen them lights and are complaining their animals are acting out of sorts.
How?
Chickens stopped laying eggs.
Cows ain't producing, and stuff like that.
Either of you two seen him around?
No.
Name's Newell.
Captain Todd Newell.
Sorry, ain't seen him.
Newell?
Ain't nobody by that name in the Corners.
I'll keep an eye out for him.
Was he the one flying that helicopter?
Yeah, Gibbs.
Gibbs, I am getting stonewalled here.
By who?
The Air Force.
I requested their file on the 1994 crop circles in Smoky Corners, you'd thought I'd asked them for their missile-launch codes.
Okay, I'll make a call.
No, you don't understand.
They're not going to tell you anything either.
This is like Area 51; it is conspiracy at the highest level.
Abby, stop yourself.
What about the cabin fire?
Gibbs, this is big!
The fire.
Unfortunately, nothing extraterrestrial there;
arson, plain old gasoline was used as an accelerant.
I'm still working on the debris.
Science can't be rushed, Gibbs.
Hi.
You all right?
Yeah, fine.
Ever see him around here?
Your gal going to be okay?
Don't you worry about her.
As long as both sides stick to the story, we'll get through this.
I can't talk right now.
But if you come back at noon, my daddy will be at the VFW in Potterville.
Okay.
Who's that?
The station owner's daughter, Daphne.
I think she wanted to talk, but couldn't.
Her father's having lunch with his buddies at the VFW in Potterville around noon.
She'll be alone.
The dogs are a no-go.
The handlers say something screwed up the dogs.
As soon as they stepped into the woods, they started acting up.
Do not tell Abby.
She's going to make something out of it.
We should start checking the back of their necks for little red Xs.
What are you talking about?
Invaders From Mars.
Wait.
I take it that's a film?
Original 1953 version, not the remake.
Everything's a movie to you, Tony.
Aliens landed in a field just like this one.
Took over the locals' minds, leaving a little red "X" on the back of the necks.
Sounds lame.
Oh, no.
Scariest movie I ever saw.
Especially when this kid tries to tell his mom and dad what's going on, the camera slowly comes around, reveals Xs on the back of Mom and Dad's necks.
Whew.
Scared of my parents for years after that.
I'm sure the feeling was mutual.
Find anything?
Uh, yeah, interviewed half a dozen locals.
Nobody saw or heard a helicopter.
Everyone has the same story.
B.O.L.s.
"Balls of light."
According to Abby, they're created by
Manipulating the atomic particles in the atmosphere.
Mm.
And who does the manipulating, McGee?
I really don't know, sir.
I'm just relating what Abby told me.
I need you to run a tox screen on this tissue sample.
Where'd you get it?
A body exhumed from Arlington.
You look overwhelmed.
I am.
And this just came in from the field.
Gibbs wants me to run prints on it ASAP.
It appears to be to be $1.65.
This poor soul's been dead for 36 years.
I doubt if a few more days will matter.
Thank you, Ducky.
Door handle?
Yeah, it came from a cabin fire.
I found traces of something in it.
I can use a second opinion.
I'm flattered.
Mammalian cells.
Most likely human flesh.
Someone was trapped I that fire.
A missing Marine aviator?
I need to call Gibbs.
Could be his missing aviator is dead.
If he died, where are his remains?
We know the fire was arson.
It started around the same time Newell and his helo disappeared.
Abby was pretty certain somebody was in the cabin.
But we didn't find any remains.
Maybe they got out.
Or someone removed the body.
Until we find remains, I'm not going to connect the dots.
Time to get the cadaver dogs up to aid the search.
Cadaver dogs coming up.
This your cabin, Mr. Clay?
Nope.
No.
My land stops right over there at the treeline there.
Who's it belong to?
Well, nobody, really.
Went to the county after Monroe died.
Who was Monroe?
A farmer from the east side.
Tried working this parcel.
Didn't have no chance, though.
Too hard to clear.
How'd Monroe die?
Hunting.
Accident.
Shack's been abandoned ever since.
I ain't sorry it burned, though.
Kids was always using the place, causing trouble.
Something wrong?
Bet his rk's worse than his bite, huh?
Uh, the bite's actually much worse.
Daphne?
Whatcha lookin' fer?
I need gas.
This way, Missy.
That'll be $6.00.
That's ten.
That's two, that's three, four dollars.
Sure that's all you want?
So, uh... what can State Police do for NCIS?
Well, we're investigating a helicopter incident in Smoky Corners.
Yeah, I heard.
You, uh...?
Sure.
Have a seat.
Met the sheriff.
Oh, Miller Thompson?
Yeah, he wasn't much help.
Well, he doesn't know about enem
But he sure loves wearing that uniform.
You get to Smoky Corners much?
Well, not ss they call.
And they don't.
Hmm.
No crime?
Nothing we get involin.
There's a fights.
Got some kind of feud going on up there.
Goes back decades.
What, like Hatfields and McCoys?
Yeah, something like that.
I honestly donhiny remembers itrted, but it split the valley right down the middle, east versus west, and I was told by my predecessor to stay clear.
Tris, they take careof their own problems.
Have they ever had a murder in Smoky Corners?
I mean, people just di natural causes or, you know, the occasional farm or hunting accident.
Things may have changed.
What's McGee doing out there?
Scanning the field with a magnetometer.
Let me guess Abby?
Her every wish is his command.
She promiso shim her new tattoo.
Wail finds or it ankle.
What did gas station girl tell you?
She was a no-show.
looks like magnet.
You are such a child.
Come on.
Just taking a sip.
It's yours.
Hey, boss.
Abby needs to talk to you.
Abs, you get any sleep?
I am overworked and not paid enough.
Quit.
What do you got?
Two partial prints on the coins from the phone booth.
Any match?
You need to send a thank you to the West Virginia DMV.
The got right index prints from two licensed drivers.
One was the trucker that delivered gasoline to the station, the second was a local, Greg Sikes.
On it.
You get any DNA off the doorknob?
"Nice work on those prints, Abs."
Thank you.
"I know you haven't had a break in two days."
Oh, that's okay.
I don't need much sleep.
Anything for the team.
I assume you'll let me know if you find something.
Don't I always?
Yeah, Abby, you do.
Thank you.
Agent Gibbs.
The cadaver dogs have found something.
Get Ducky.
Smoky Corners bachelor quarters.
Something to be said for living in a trailer.
Get tired of the view, you just roll it to a new location.
Come on, McGee.
What, are you never going to talk to me again?
How long am I going to be the butt of your practical jokes,snide innuendos and juvenile put-downs?
I will always outrank you, probie.
Come on.
Mr. Sikes, NCIS.
Whoa.
Come on in.
Someone left in a hurry.
Huh, no phone.
Ah, nice... teeth.
Duck, what can you tell me?
Uh, not much.
Male, roughly six feet.
Tests I did on femur, clavicle, suggest not that old.
Give me a range.
Mid 20's to 30's.
Oh, this distinctive fracture on the inferior left scapula is consistent with a bullet wound.
Cause of death?
Well, maybe.
Or it could be trauma or asphyxiation.
I don't know if I'll ever be certain.
There's not much to work with, Jethro.
Gibbs!
Yeah?
I used nonisotopic chemiluminescent method to compare the charred DNA to Newell's.
Uh-huh, and?
And it's not his DNA.
But it's damn close.
Oh, come on, Abs.
We're not playing horseshoes.
There's a 99% probability that the fire victim is Newell's male sibling.
That can't be.
Newell's record of emergency data doesn't list a brother.
DNA doesn't lie, Jethro.
People do.
The crispy critter was Captain Newell's brother.
His OQR was wrong?
Recruits lie about things all the timeespecially their age.
Why lie about having a brother?
Is Abby sure?
Yeah, she double checked.
Obviously you two didn't.
We assumed his family history was right.
NCIS agents don't assume anything, Agent Todd.
They check and re-check.
Verify, everything, independently.
We are on it.
There's a definite difference.
I don't see it.
Look at the elongated node.
It's undamaged.
The plants inside the crop circle were changed in a way that is beyond human ability.
I'm rerunning an analysis hoping to find anomalous molecular change to the stalks within the circle.
I'm betting they were subjected to a very short blast of high energy heat, possibly microwave generated.
Rerunning because you came up empty.
Abby, you're looking for something that isn't there.
You've been here for two days straight.
You're tired, you've done everything that
Gibbs has asked, so go home, get some sleep.
I can't sleep.
What are you doing?
You're guilty of confirmation bias.
It's not there, Abs.
You're ignoring the obvious and you're searching for microscopic proof of something that doesn't exist.
Maybe I should join the CIA.
Look at the big picture.
The design of the smaller outer circles was created by bending the corn stalks down in a clockwise direction.
Now look under the helicopter.
Those pants were forced outward from the center by the downdraft of the blades.
The corn was still standing and was forced down by the landing of the Cobra.
Crop circle's a hoax, Abby.
Created, created around a parked helicopter.
Why would anyone do that?
Orange County clerk faxed us his parents marriage certificate.
Todd Newell was nine years old when his mother remarried.
he was legally adopted, that's how he got the Newell name.
His mother's maiden name was Stelling, which is common in Smoky Corners.
First husband's a guy named Sikes.
They had two boys Greg and Todd.
Todd Newell was born in Smoky Corners.
His co-pilot, Captain Barnett, swears that he never
Mentioned a brother or Smoky Corners.
In fact, Barnett couldn't recall Newell ever mentioning anything about his childhood.
We need to find his biological father.
Can't, he died several years ago... in a hunting accident.
Aw, gee, where have I heard that one before?
So we got a dead civilian in Ducky's cooler.
We going to turn it over to the local authorities?
Nope, not yet.
I want to know more, first.
Greg Sikes was involved with the girl at the gas station.
She seemed willing to talk.
Maybe I should go back there and try to find her.
Go with her.
All right, so we're on the same page, right?
I guess, but let me tell Gibbs.
Tell me what?
The crop circle was a hoax, created around the helicopter after it landed.
You don't sound convincing, Abs.
Yeah, well, there's still a lot of stuff that can't be explained.
Like what?
Balls of light in the sky, the animals acting weird, like, a missing pilot.
Everyone's story is exactly the same.
It's too rehearsed.
It's what they want us to hear.
That's exactly what I told her.
But what about the search dogs?
I heard they were acting all confused and disoriented.
Only the first day.
The cadaver dogs had no problem finding the body this morning.
I know why we haven't been able to find Captain Newell.
Thanks, guys.
How do you know?
Because I'm a Marine.
Newell is alive?
Yeah.
Well, who's body did we find?
His brother.
Captain Newell's still out there.
How do you know that?
He received SERE training, Colonel.
He's evading us.
As part of his training he was taught a technique to negate enemy dogs.
Yeah, GS powder, the irritant used in gas mask simulations.
I keep a couple of capsules in my survival vest.
Dogs get a whiff of that, they're useless for days.
He used it on the search dogs.
Now he also has pilot's night-vision goggles and a survival radio to monitor our communications.
Colonel, he's using his Marine Corps training to evade us.
Will you stop that?
You're driving me crazy.
Sorry.
Do I detect a little PMS?
I didn't think that was till next week.
Hey, it's a high-stress job.
You carry a gun.
I need to know when you're not your best.
Sike's trailer is coming up.
Daphne wasn't at the gas station.
If she's not there, I don't know where else to look.
That's Daphne's truck.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey!
Hey!
Daphne, why are you running?
I thought you wanted to talk to us, Daphne.
Daphne, talk to us.
What happened?
What happened?
Are you looking for Greg?
We know he's your boyfriend, that's why we're here looking for you, okay?
Where is he?
Daphne, are you pregnant?
Five months.
Greg's hiding from my daddy.
You know where he is?
Greg's dead, isn't he?
Whatever Newell's brother said to him on the phone got him upset enough to risk his entire careerwith an unauthorized flight in a Cobra.
Boss, you sure you don't want me to drive for a while?
But why land in the farmer's field?
Um, well...
My guess, McGee... it was the closest clearing to the cabin where is brother was hiding, only Newell was too late.
Wh-What?
Focus on the case, McGee.
Sorry, uh, yes, Sir.
Why the crop circle?
Well, uh, I have a theory on that.
You care to share?
Yeah, uh, okay.
Spit it out, McGee.
Okay, uh...
Whoever killed Greg Sikes thought that they could cover it up as another farm or hunting accident.
But they couldn't cover up an attack helicopter abandoned in a corn field.
Conspiracy, huh?
Makes sense.
Take a lot of people to form that pattern in a few hours.
Right, and they knew that there would be an outside investigation, so they created the circle hoping that we'd do exactly what the Air Force did ten years ago back off and cover up what couldn't be explained.
Not bad, McGee.
Not bad.
Where is she?
Inside, she seemed to relate better to Kate.
joy the ride, McGee?
Daphne's father threatened to kill Greg because...
She's pregnant.
Greg and me from different corners of the valley.
God, I hate this rotten place.
This stupid feud.
When'd you last see him?
At the gas station.
Using the payphone to call his brother for help.
Was Greg close to his brother?
He hadn't seen him since they was kids.
About a year ago he got a call telling him their mother died.
It reunited them.
They're the only family either of them have left.
Daphne's afraid that Captain Newell's been drawn back into the feud.
He's gonna kill my daddy to get revenge.
Kate, you and McGee get Daphne out of here.
What's up, boss?
Go for Teague.
Colonel, call off the search.
Pull your men out.
Why?
You said Newell's still out there.
He is.
He wants revenge.
But he's not going to make his move until he thinks we're gone.
They're leaving.
Ritt, we pulled it off.
The Marines have backed off.
This thing's going away.
Nobody's told outsiders nothing.
My problem... is Greg Sikes' brother.
See, I got to get him, 'for he gets me.
This is White Hawk 3-4.
Terminating search.
Returning to base.
3-4 out.
Ritt, think twice about what you're fixing to do.
They ain't got nothing, Ritt.
Just stick to the story.
What's going on?
Looks like y'all are pulling out.
The Marines are, we aren't.
Do you get a kick out of smacking your daughter around?
Why don't you just get out of here?
DiNozzo, read him his rights.
What are you talking about?
The murder of Greg Sikes.
Greg Sikes is dead?
I thought he went hunting.
We found his remains.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Ain't you out of your jurisdiction?
You're the law here, Miller.
Yeah, I am.
Don't get excited, Sheriff.
The West Virginia State Police are on their way, but I do have the authority to detain both of you until they arrive.
We, too, have guns.
White man has more guns and more warriors.
We need one of your people to guide us through the mountains.
Gibbs, I have a bogey.
In the trees, closing in from the northwest.
Everybody copy.
Yeah, boss.
Got it.
He slipped behind the old cars.
Let him get closer.
Roger that.
Oh, man.
He made me.
Hit the lights!
NCIS!
Lower your weapon,
Captain Newell!
It's over.
It's not over till Ritt Everett's dead.
He's in the custody of the State Police.
That's not going to change anything.
It's an eye-for-an-eye here, always has been.
Is that why your mother took you away?
Put down your weapon.
Why?
I'm never going to fly again.
No, your career's probably over, but you haven't hurt anybody yet.
Keep it that way, and I'll do everything I can to help you.
There is a young girl carrying your brother's baby
and they could sure use your help.
Once we left, it was like Smoky Corners never existed.
My mother erased it from our lives.
I always felt guilty she had to leave Greg behind, but our father wouldn't let her have both of us.
Why'd you take the Cobra?
It's fierce, intimidating.
I hoped it would scare the crap out of those hicks, save Greg's life.
And I was too late.
The cabin was in flames, Greg trapped inside.
Everett and the others started shooting at me and I got hit.
And they had hunting rifles, I only had my pistol.
I was cut off from the helo, couldn't get back to the base.
I knew my Marine Corps career was over.
All that was left for me was revenge.
Wow, those are really pretty, Kate.
Where are they from?
Tony.
We had a tough couple of days.
Kate pointed out that I'd taken one too many liberties.
The flowers are a mea culpa.
Tony, I'm blown away.
They're gorgeous.
And they're from Martha's Garden, my favorite florist.
How'd you know?
Lucky guess.
He went through your purse and got the phone number off your PDA.
Most people tend to their personal hygiene at home.
This bothers you?
No, what bothers me is that it doesn't bother me anymore.
I'm an acquired taste.
Actually, it's more like the Stockholm syndrome.
The emotional attachment to a captor formed by hostages are result of continuous stress and a need to cooperate for survival.
Nice shot.
Get the truck.
Where we going, boss?
Smoky Corners, West Virginia.
Marine helo was found abandoned.
-Crew's missing.
-Any leads?
You tell me.
It's sitting in the middle of a crop circle.
Abby's going to make us crazy.
Come on, let's go.
I don't believe it.
They never make it easy.
Lieutenant Colonel Curtis Teague.
Squadron CO.
HMLA 167.
Gibbs.
NCIS.
Colonel, your people have contaminated the scene.
I'm missing two men, Gibbs.
Wasn't going to sit on my ass and wait for NCIS to drive out from Washington.
Yeah, well, we're going to have to take elimination prints from all your people.
Let NCIS do their job.
Stand down.
Any damage to the aircraft?
No.
The engine checks out.
Hydraulic and avionics gear are operative.
Fuel load's at 60 percent.
When was your last contact with the crew?
They took off from New River at 2300 on a routine night proficiency flight.
Were cleared to a practice area over Chesapeake Bay.
Flight controller lost the transponder signal ten minutes out.
Tried to make radio contact, never got a response.
I was notified a half hour later.
How'd you find it?
We were organizing to launch a search and rescue mission when I got a call from the local sheriff.
The farmer that owns this field discovered it just after sunrise.
DiNozzo.
Yeah, boss?
Sketch and shoot.
Kate, the cockpit.
Trace evidence, bag and tag.
-McGee, the field.
Lay out a grid.
-Got it.
We just started the air search.
Hopefully we'll find them.
I'm ignoring the fact that my aircraft is in the middle of a crop circle.
What about you, Agent Gibbs, what are your thoughts?
Do I think your men were abducted by aliens, Colonel?
No.
I don't, but I'm not going to ignore anything.
I need an overhead view of the field.
Already took digital photos.
Sergeant Ramos!
Sir.
Camera.
Who are the missing men?
Pilot is Captain Todd Newell.
Co-pilot Captain Patrick Barnett.
Good marines.
But they're young pilots.
Hot shots.
The two are close.
They share an apartment off base.
I need their Officer Qualification Records and NATOPS jackets.
McGee!
Yeah, boss?
Shots of the crop circle.
E-mail them to Abby.
Abby?
You certain you want to do that?
You know, she's obsessed with the paranormal and...
Right.
I'm on it.
I do not want UFO freaks crawling around here, Colonel.
Let's keep a lid on this.
No releases to the media.
Agreed.
I should've been an aviator.
These things are chick magnets.
I hate helicopters.
They're loud, uncomfortable and dangerous.
Used to dread getting on Marine One with the President.
Ew.
Tony...
What?
You're getting way too comfortable around me.
Okay, clipping your nails is one thing, but that, that is crossing the line.
Come on.
No, I'm serious.
I've had enough of your locker room mentality.
I would be upset if someone I was dating dating took such familiarities.
Well, we work together.
So feel free to scratch or adjust anything you like in front of me.
I'm always up before the sun.
It's only 30 acres, but it's a lot of work.
You didn't hear anything last night?
Nothing.
So how long you think it's gonna be before they get that thing out of here?
I got work to do.
What do you think happened to your field?
You're asking me?
Ask the Air Force.
This isn't the first crop circle here.
We had one in 1994.
The Air Force investigated, but we never did get no answers.
There were lights back then, too.
Lights?
Lit up the sky last night.
Woke me up.
It wasn't lightning.
There was no thunder.
Like I told you, I didn't hear anything.
Just tried to put it out of my mind till I discovered this.
We may have more questions for you, Mr. Clay.
I ain't going nowhere.
Well, guess I should ask around.
See if anybody else seen something.
How long you been sheriff?
Couple years now.
Your full-time job?
I also run the grain and feed store.
Whoa.
McGee, you are turning me on.
It's very Glastonbury, circa 1980s.
I mean, not quite as large or elaborate, but it's a fascinating pictogram.
I'm not familiar with Glastonbury.
Southern England?
Where most of the crop circles were found?
Abby, they're hoaxes.
You have to admit they are interesting.
Yeah, I put them right up there with tarot cards and telephone psychics.
Thought two farmers admitted to creating them.
Yeah, but there's been over 10,000 reported all over the world.
There's no way those two did them all.
Abby, nothing paranormal happened here.
Yeah, there was no damage to the helicopter, yet the entire crew vanished.
You can't take crop circles seriously, you're a scientist.
There's a logical explanation.
Listen to me, McGee.
I need pictures, and lots of them.
And specimens of the stalks down to the roots.
And a core sample of soil, at least 12 inches.
Make sure you get a control sample from outside the circle.
Abby, we're looking for two missing marines.
Come on, McGee.
Do it for me, please?
I'll show you my new tat.
The replacement crew is ready to fly the Cobra back to New River.
Go ahead, we got everything we need.
Clear to go.
Do we really need all this stuff?
Just following instructions.
Ask Abby.
All right, McGee and I will take the truck back.
You two, check out the pilots' apartment.
Right.
I'll try not to be too familiar, Ms. Todd.
Hey, get the scent articles for the search dog.
Okay.
What is it, boss?
I was worried about keeping a lid on this thing.
Where are the gawkers?
You see any locals other than the farmer who owns this field and the sheriff?
Special Agent Gibbs.
The Huey spotted a burnt-out area just north of here.
You might want to come with us.
You think this has something to do with my crew?
I don't know, but we're going to find out.
We've got another scene to process.
So, we're looking for anything that suggests they didn't just leave on a routine flight.
Thanks for explaining, Special Agent DiNozzo.
Oh, my God, I don't believe it.
Do you know what this is?
This is a classic.
December '92.
Pamela's debut.
I lost my copy.
Lost it or wore it out?
We need to get scent articles for the dogs.
What the hell are you doing in my apartment?
NCIS.
Let her go.
I understand you're not cooperating, Captain Barnett.
I don't know anything.
It's Saturday night.
I was at my girlfriend's.
Got home, just getting out of the shower and I heard someone in my apartment.
Where's Captain Newell?
I don't know.
You were scheduled for a proficiency flight at 2300 last night.
Did you take it?
What's the flight schedule say, sir?
Well, it says right here Newell and you took off from New River.
Then we did.
Here's how it works, ace.
I ask the questions, you give direct answers.
Did you take the flight?
I think Gibbs enjoys this more than sex.
That would explain the three wives.
Your Cobra was found abandoned 150 miles from where it was supposed to be and Newell is missing.
What is Gibbs doing?
TBI.
Excuse me?
Truth by intimidation.
In five... four... three... two... one.
We were leaving for the base when Todd got a call on his cell.
He took it into the bedroom.
When he came out... he was messed up.
He said he wasn't feeling well and wanted to call the Squadron Deputy
Officer in Ops to cancel the hop.
Who made the call?
I don't know.
I don't believe you, Barnett.
You live together, you fly together, you fight together, you share everything.
I thought we did.
Look, I rode his ass to figure out what was going on, but Todd, he got really pissed.
Told me to lay low for the rest of the night.
He didn't want me getting in trouble.
And you let it go at that?
Todd said he'd explain when he got back.
I believe him.
Sign it.
What did Gibbs whisper in his ear?
If I knew, I'd be Gibbs.
I'm gonna go pull Captain Newell's cell records.
Did you feel an energy when you were inside the circle, McGee?
Did you get a tingling sensation or start to vibrate?
You're gonna vibrate if you don't do what Gibbs wants.
I'm running tests on the molecular structure of plants from within and outside the circle.
Okay, Abby, Gibbs made it clear the priority is the cabin fire.
You know, people try to imitate the real thing, but the notion that all recorded formations were man-made with simple flattening tools does not explain the well-documented plant alterations by electromagnetic effect.
I warned you.
Operation Duty Officer at New River said that Captain Newell signed the log.
When I pressed, he admitted that he never really saw Captain Barnett.
He just assumed he was on the flight line, preflighting.
So Newell took off alone.
Can you fly a Cobra by yourself?
Oh, yes.
Yeah, I'm still here.
Anything unusual in Newell's OQR or his NATOPS jacket?
He's an only child.
Grew up in Florida, just outside Orlando.
Any connection to West Virginia?
No.
His parents died in an auto accident two years ago.
His father sold insurance, and mother was an accountant at Disney World.
Yeah, Gibbs.
You can see Barnett anytime you'd like, Colonel.
Teague?
Good C.O.
Newell went through NROTC at the University of Florida before flight school.
His impulsiveness has gotten him in some trouble.
A fight cost him a non-punitive letter of caution.
That's great.
Last call Captain Newell got on his cell was at 2130 last night.
Hasn't made or received a call since.
His phone is currently off.
Where was the call from?
A pay phone in Smoky Corners, West Virginia.
According to the phone company, this thing hardly ever gets used.
Well, I guess even people out here have cell phones.
We're being watched.
Mm-hmm.
I see.
Sheriff Thompson.
You better get over here.
Find anything?
It's clean.
Too clean.
Not even a smudge.
Yeah, looks like the only thing out here that has been cleaned recently.
Let me have a whack at it.
What's he doing?
Okay.
Get those to Abby for prints.
What are you doing to the phone?
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.
Who are you?
Ritt Everett.
This is my store.
Seen anyone using the phone Tuesday night?
Well, let's see.
Nope.
This have anything to do about that helicopter in the crop circle?
Hello, Sheriff.
Special Agent Gibbs.
Any luck?
Well, sir, luck doesn't have much to do with it.
I've been asking around.
Lot of folks seen them lights and are complaining their animals are acting out of sorts.
How?
Chickens stopped laying eggs.
Cows ain't producing, and stuff like that.
Either of you two seen him around?
No.
Name's Newell.
Captain Todd Newell.
Sorry, ain't seen him.
Newell?
Ain't nobody by that name in the Corners.
I'll keep an eye out for him.
Was he the one flying that helicopter?
Yeah, Gibbs.
Gibbs, I am getting stonewalled here.
By who?
The Air Force.
I requested their file on the 1994 crop circles in Smoky Corners, you'd thought I'd asked them for their missile-launch codes.
Okay, I'll make a call.
No, you don't understand.
They're not going to tell you anything either.
This is like Area 51; it is conspiracy at the highest level.
Abby, stop yourself.
What about the cabin fire?
Gibbs, this is big!
The fire.
Unfortunately, nothing extraterrestrial there;
arson, plain old gasoline was used as an accelerant.
I'm still working on the debris.
Science can't be rushed, Gibbs.
Hi.
You all right?
Yeah, fine.
Ever see him around here?
Your gal going to be okay?
Don't you worry about her.
As long as both sides stick to the story, we'll get through this.
I can't talk right now.
But if you come back at noon, my daddy will be at the VFW in Potterville.
Okay.
Who's that?
The station owner's daughter, Daphne.
I think she wanted to talk, but couldn't.
Her father's having lunch with his buddies at the VFW in Potterville around noon.
She'll be alone.
The dogs are a no-go.
The handlers say something screwed up the dogs.
As soon as they stepped into the woods, they started acting up.
Do not tell Abby.
She's going to make something out of it.
We should start checking the back of their necks for little red Xs.
What are you talking about?
Invaders From Mars.
Wait.
I take it that's a film?
Original 1953 version, not the remake.
Everything's a movie to you, Tony.
Aliens landed in a field just like this one.
Took over the locals' minds, leaving a little red "X" on the back of the necks.
Sounds lame.
Oh, no.
Scariest movie I ever saw.
Especially when this kid tries to tell his mom and dad what's going on, the camera slowly comes around, reveals Xs on the back of Mom and Dad's necks.
Whew.
Scared of my parents for years after that.
I'm sure the feeling was mutual.
Find anything?
Uh, yeah, interviewed half a dozen locals.
Nobody saw or heard a helicopter.
Everyone has the same story.
B.O.L.s.
"Balls of light."
According to Abby, they're created by
Manipulating the atomic particles in the atmosphere.
Mm.
And who does the manipulating, McGee?
I really don't know, sir.
I'm just relating what Abby told me.
I need you to run a tox screen on this tissue sample.
Where'd you get it?
A body exhumed from Arlington.
You look overwhelmed.
I am.
And this just came in from the field.
Gibbs wants me to run prints on it ASAP.
It appears to be to be $1.65.
This poor soul's been dead for 36 years.
I doubt if a few more days will matter.
Thank you, Ducky.
Door handle?
Yeah, it came from a cabin fire.
I found traces of something in it.
I can use a second opinion.
I'm flattered.
Mammalian cells.
Most likely human flesh.
Someone was trapped I that fire.
A missing Marine aviator?
I need to call Gibbs.
Could be his missing aviator is dead.
If he died, where are his remains?
We know the fire was arson.
It started around the same time Newell and his helo disappeared.
Abby was pretty certain somebody was in the cabin.
But we didn't find any remains.
Maybe they got out.
Or someone removed the body.
Until we find remains, I'm not going to connect the dots.
Time to get the cadaver dogs up to aid the search.
Cadaver dogs coming up.
This your cabin, Mr. Clay?
Nope.
No.
My land stops right over there at the treeline there.
Who's it belong to?
Well, nobody, really.
Went to the county after Monroe died.
Who was Monroe?
A farmer from the east side.
Tried working this parcel.
Didn't have no chance, though.
Too hard to clear.
How'd Monroe die?
Hunting.
Accident.
Shack's been abandoned ever since.
I ain't sorry it burned, though.
Kids was always using the place, causing trouble.
Something wrong?
Bet his rk's worse than his bite, huh?
Uh, the bite's actually much worse.
Daphne?
Whatcha lookin' fer?
I need gas.
This way, Missy.
That'll be $6.00.
That's ten.
That's two, that's three, four dollars.
Sure that's all you want?
So, uh... what can State Police do for NCIS?
Well, we're investigating a helicopter incident in Smoky Corners.
Yeah, I heard.
You, uh...?
Sure.
Have a seat.
Met the sheriff.
Oh, Miller Thompson?
Yeah, he wasn't much help.
Well, he doesn't know about enem
But he sure loves wearing that uniform.
You get to Smoky Corners much?
Well, not ss they call.
And they don't.
Hmm.
No crime?
Nothing we get involin.
There's a fights.
Got some kind of feud going on up there.
Goes back decades.
What, like Hatfields and McCoys?
Yeah, something like that.
I honestly donhiny remembers itrted, but it split the valley right down the middle, east versus west, and I was told by my predecessor to stay clear.
Tris, they take careof their own problems.
Have they ever had a murder in Smoky Corners?
I mean, people just di natural causes or, you know, the occasional farm or hunting accident.
Things may have changed.
What's McGee doing out there?
Scanning the field with a magnetometer.
Let me guess Abby?
Her every wish is his command.
She promiso shim her new tattoo.
Wail finds or it ankle.
What did gas station girl tell you?
She was a no-show.
looks like magnet.
You are such a child.
Come on.
Just taking a sip.
It's yours.
Hey, boss.
Abby needs to talk to you.
Abs, you get any sleep?
I am overworked and not paid enough.
Quit.
What do you got?
Two partial prints on the coins from the phone booth.
Any match?
You need to send a thank you to the West Virginia DMV.
The got right index prints from two licensed drivers.
One was the trucker that delivered gasoline to the station, the second was a local, Greg Sikes.
On it.
You get any DNA off the doorknob?
"Nice work on those prints, Abs."
Thank you.
"I know you haven't had a break in two days."
Oh, that's okay.
I don't need much sleep.
Anything for the team.
I assume you'll let me know if you find something.
Don't I always?
Yeah, Abby, you do.
Thank you.
Agent Gibbs.
The cadaver dogs have found something.
Get Ducky.
Smoky Corners bachelor quarters.
Something to be said for living in a trailer.
Get tired of the view, you just roll it to a new location.
Come on, McGee.
What, are you never going to talk to me again?
How long am I going to be the butt of your practical jokes,snide innuendos and juvenile put-downs?
I will always outrank you, probie.
Come on.
Mr. Sikes, NCIS.
Whoa.
Come on in.
Someone left in a hurry.
Huh, no phone.
Ah, nice... teeth.
Duck, what can you tell me?
Uh, not much.
Male, roughly six feet.
Tests I did on femur, clavicle, suggest not that old.
Give me a range.
Mid 20's to 30's.
Oh, this distinctive fracture on the inferior left scapula is consistent with a bullet wound.
Cause of death?
Well, maybe.
Or it could be trauma or asphyxiation.
I don't know if I'll ever be certain.
There's not much to work with, Jethro.
Gibbs!
Yeah?
I used nonisotopic chemiluminescent method to compare the charred DNA to Newell's.
Uh-huh, and?
And it's not his DNA.
But it's damn close.
Oh, come on, Abs.
We're not playing horseshoes.
There's a 99% probability that the fire victim is Newell's male sibling.
That can't be.
Newell's record of emergency data doesn't list a brother.
DNA doesn't lie, Jethro.
People do.
The crispy critter was Captain Newell's brother.
His OQR was wrong?
Recruits lie about things all the timeespecially their age.
Why lie about having a brother?
Is Abby sure?
Yeah, she double checked.
Obviously you two didn't.
We assumed his family history was right.
NCIS agents don't assume anything, Agent Todd.
They check and re-check.
Verify, everything, independently.
We are on it.
There's a definite difference.
I don't see it.
Look at the elongated node.
It's undamaged.
The plants inside the crop circle were changed in a way that is beyond human ability.
I'm rerunning an analysis hoping to find anomalous molecular change to the stalks within the circle.
I'm betting they were subjected to a very short blast of high energy heat, possibly microwave generated.
Rerunning because you came up empty.
Abby, you're looking for something that isn't there.
You've been here for two days straight.
You're tired, you've done everything that
Gibbs has asked, so go home, get some sleep.
I can't sleep.
What are you doing?
You're guilty of confirmation bias.
It's not there, Abs.
You're ignoring the obvious and you're searching for microscopic proof of something that doesn't exist.
Maybe I should join the CIA.
Look at the big picture.
The design of the smaller outer circles was created by bending the corn stalks down in a clockwise direction.
Now look under the helicopter.
Those pants were forced outward from the center by the downdraft of the blades.
The corn was still standing and was forced down by the landing of the Cobra.
Crop circle's a hoax, Abby.
Created, created around a parked helicopter.
Why would anyone do that?
Orange County clerk faxed us his parents marriage certificate.
Todd Newell was nine years old when his mother remarried.
he was legally adopted, that's how he got the Newell name.
His mother's maiden name was Stelling, which is common in Smoky Corners.
First husband's a guy named Sikes.
They had two boys Greg and Todd.
Todd Newell was born in Smoky Corners.
His co-pilot, Captain Barnett, swears that he never
Mentioned a brother or Smoky Corners.
In fact, Barnett couldn't recall Newell ever mentioning anything about his childhood.
We need to find his biological father.
Can't, he died several years ago... in a hunting accident.
Aw, gee, where have I heard that one before?
So we got a dead civilian in Ducky's cooler.
We going to turn it over to the local authorities?
Nope, not yet.
I want to know more, first.
Greg Sikes was involved with the girl at the gas station.
She seemed willing to talk.
Maybe I should go back there and try to find her.
Go with her.
All right, so we're on the same page, right?
I guess, but let me tell Gibbs.
Tell me what?
The crop circle was a hoax, created around the helicopter after it landed.
You don't sound convincing, Abs.
Yeah, well, there's still a lot of stuff that can't be explained.
Like what?
Balls of light in the sky, the animals acting weird, like, a missing pilot.
Everyone's story is exactly the same.
It's too rehearsed.
It's what they want us to hear.
That's exactly what I told her.
But what about the search dogs?
I heard they were acting all confused and disoriented.
Only the first day.
The cadaver dogs had no problem finding the body this morning.
I know why we haven't been able to find Captain Newell.
Thanks, guys.
How do you know?
Because I'm a Marine.
Newell is alive?
Yeah.
Well, who's body did we find?
His brother.
Captain Newell's still out there.
How do you know that?
He received SERE training, Colonel.
He's evading us.
As part of his training he was taught a technique to negate enemy dogs.
Yeah, GS powder, the irritant used in gas mask simulations.
I keep a couple of capsules in my survival vest.
Dogs get a whiff of that, they're useless for days.
He used it on the search dogs.
Now he also has pilot's night-vision goggles and a survival radio to monitor our communications.
Colonel, he's using his Marine Corps training to evade us.
Will you stop that?
You're driving me crazy.
Sorry.
Do I detect a little PMS?
I didn't think that was till next week.
Hey, it's a high-stress job.
You carry a gun.
I need to know when you're not your best.
Sike's trailer is coming up.
Daphne wasn't at the gas station.
If she's not there, I don't know where else to look.
That's Daphne's truck.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey!
Hey!
Daphne, why are you running?
I thought you wanted to talk to us, Daphne.
Daphne, talk to us.
What happened?
What happened?
Are you looking for Greg?
We know he's your boyfriend, that's why we're here looking for you, okay?
Where is he?
Daphne, are you pregnant?
Five months.
Greg's hiding from my daddy.
You know where he is?
Greg's dead, isn't he?
Whatever Newell's brother said to him on the phone got him upset enough to risk his entire careerwith an unauthorized flight in a Cobra.
Boss, you sure you don't want me to drive for a while?
But why land in the farmer's field?
Um, well...
My guess, McGee... it was the closest clearing to the cabin where is brother was hiding, only Newell was too late.
Wh-What?
Focus on the case, McGee.
Sorry, uh, yes, Sir.
Why the crop circle?
Well, uh, I have a theory on that.
You care to share?
Yeah, uh, okay.
Spit it out, McGee.
Okay, uh...
Whoever killed Greg Sikes thought that they could cover it up as another farm or hunting accident.
But they couldn't cover up an attack helicopter abandoned in a corn field.
Conspiracy, huh?
Makes sense.
Take a lot of people to form that pattern in a few hours.
Right, and they knew that there would be an outside investigation, so they created the circle hoping that we'd do exactly what the Air Force did ten years ago back off and cover up what couldn't be explained.
Not bad, McGee.
Not bad.
Where is she?
Inside, she seemed to relate better to Kate.
joy the ride, McGee?
Daphne's father threatened to kill Greg because...
She's pregnant.
Greg and me from different corners of the valley.
God, I hate this rotten place.
This stupid feud.
When'd you last see him?
At the gas station.
Using the payphone to call his brother for help.
Was Greg close to his brother?
He hadn't seen him since they was kids.
About a year ago he got a call telling him their mother died.
It reunited them.
They're the only family either of them have left.
Daphne's afraid that Captain Newell's been drawn back into the feud.
He's gonna kill my daddy to get revenge.
Kate, you and McGee get Daphne out of here.
What's up, boss?
Go for Teague.
Colonel, call off the search.
Pull your men out.
Why?
You said Newell's still out there.
He is.
He wants revenge.
But he's not going to make his move until he thinks we're gone.
They're leaving.
Ritt, we pulled it off.
The Marines have backed off.
This thing's going away.
Nobody's told outsiders nothing.
My problem... is Greg Sikes' brother.
See, I got to get him, 'for he gets me.
This is White Hawk 3-4.
Terminating search.
Returning to base.
3-4 out.
Ritt, think twice about what you're fixing to do.
They ain't got nothing, Ritt.
Just stick to the story.
What's going on?
Looks like y'all are pulling out.
The Marines are, we aren't.
Do you get a kick out of smacking your daughter around?
Why don't you just get out of here?
DiNozzo, read him his rights.
What are you talking about?
The murder of Greg Sikes.
Greg Sikes is dead?
I thought he went hunting.
We found his remains.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Ain't you out of your jurisdiction?
You're the law here, Miller.
Yeah, I am.
Don't get excited, Sheriff.
The West Virginia State Police are on their way, but I do have the authority to detain both of you until they arrive.
We, too, have guns.
White man has more guns and more warriors.
We need one of your people to guide us through the mountains.
Gibbs, I have a bogey.
In the trees, closing in from the northwest.
Everybody copy.
Yeah, boss.
Got it.
He slipped behind the old cars.
Let him get closer.
Roger that.
Oh, man.
He made me.
Hit the lights!
NCIS!
Lower your weapon,
Captain Newell!
It's over.
It's not over till Ritt Everett's dead.
He's in the custody of the State Police.
That's not going to change anything.
It's an eye-for-an-eye here, always has been.
Is that why your mother took you away?
Put down your weapon.
Why?
I'm never going to fly again.
No, your career's probably over, but you haven't hurt anybody yet.
Keep it that way, and I'll do everything I can to help you.
There is a young girl carrying your brother's baby
and they could sure use your help.
Once we left, it was like Smoky Corners never existed.
My mother erased it from our lives.
I always felt guilty she had to leave Greg behind, but our father wouldn't let her have both of us.
Why'd you take the Cobra?
It's fierce, intimidating.
I hoped it would scare the crap out of those hicks, save Greg's life.
And I was too late.
The cabin was in flames, Greg trapped inside.
Everett and the others started shooting at me and I got hit.
And they had hunting rifles, I only had my pistol.
I was cut off from the helo, couldn't get back to the base.
I knew my Marine Corps career was over.
All that was left for me was revenge.
Wow, those are really pretty, Kate.
Where are they from?
Tony.
We had a tough couple of days.
Kate pointed out that I'd taken one too many liberties.
The flowers are a mea culpa.
Tony, I'm blown away.
They're gorgeous.
And they're from Martha's Garden, my favorite florist.
How'd you know?
Lucky guess.

You belong in the circus, not here!
Don't say that, Landlady.
There must be a reason they're here.
Everyone has his reasons.
We don't want to make trouble.
I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.
We'll never hear the end of it.
Why don't you get lost!
Your wife shouldn't be so nasty.
MOANS
You okay?
WOMAN:
Masters.
We have nothing precious to give you, but take this as a token of our appreciation.
Thanks for saving us!
LANDLAD Y:
Stop the crying.
This isn't a show!
You're so cold-hearted.
Talking back to me, eh?
You may know kung fu, but you're still a fairy.
CRYING
It's no crime to be good at kung fu!
Once a fairy, always a fairy.
Look at you.
What's with the red underwear?
Why not a diaper while you're at it.
J ANE:
What's wrong with red underwear?
Where were you when there was trouble?
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.
Be reasonable!
I'll reason with you.
You owe me three months' rent.
That's $90.
Pay up or pack up!
Don't you worry.
I'll pay it.
Think you're a smartass, Rabbit-Tooth Jane?
What's it to you, tub of lard?
Bitch!
Calm down, Landlady.
This is your fault.

I think you should get closer and take better aim.

Where's the third knife?
God knows where it went.
Could it be the same one?
Can't be...
Don't!
Sorry.

I just remembered I have something to do.
See you!

Their warrior days are long over, but they're still top fighters.
This job is a great challenge for us.
Now, that's professionalism.
Number One Killers.
Expensive, yes, but worth every penny!
No!
Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer.
HARPIST 2:
He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
Strictly speaking, we're just musicians.

But having seen real masters like you...
I can now die in peace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.
Years ago... we saw our only son killed in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters and we'll avenge them!
Becoming a top fighter takes time.
Unless you're a natural-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.

So far, I've never found one.

If you find me a worthy opponent...
I'll do it for free.

Don't make it hard for me!

That's quick!
Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will!
Go on!
Thank you, Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before, you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living!
The streets out there are filled with money and women.
You only need the will and determination to seize the opportunity to win.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone, and we're in the gang.
Then it'II be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars with no ambition.
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'II smash your glasses!

Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist palm kung fu?
Hey there, handsome boy.

You're so young, but you have the bone structure... and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.

I'II pay it.

Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer.
He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
strictly speaking, we're just musicians.
A song that wrenches the heart O where do I find a knowing ear?
Great poem, isn't it?
We'II be saying goodbye soon.
Who knows when we'II see each other again.
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a Iot to pack.
You're right.
twelve Kicks of the Tam school!
Superb attack and defense!
Iron Fist: powerful yet delicate.
Topnotch!
Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves.
mystical!
till we meet again!
More Iipstick!
Stay there, or I'II break you in half.
Sorry, we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material!
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories....
insulting the Axe Gang!
We'II show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good!
Don't block my view!
Damn!
I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here.
-really?
-Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'II pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry.
It's nothing!
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry, sorry!
Get out of my way!
Hang in there, tailor.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the Iast we'II see of them.
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down!
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
people are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you I can now die in peace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.
Years ago we saw our only son killed in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters and we'II avenge them!
Becoming a top fighter takes time.
unless you're a naturaI-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.
It's obvious I'm the one!
Don't think so.
Everyone!
We swore we'd never fight again.
But we broke that promise today.
For your own safety, please all leave!
In great power lies great responsibility.
There's no escaping from it.
Donut, you're hurt bad.
Rest now.
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
I know you, four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-chaIIenged.
That's right.
especially goId-framed four-eyes.
gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I Iook good.
So why keep picking on me?
help me!
"help me!
help me!" Want to play, punks?
The Dragon style?
The Tiger style?
Come down here, and I'II smash your glasses.
Come on!
You know I'd do it, right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes all because of you!
You're a numb-nut!
follow me!
It's a stickup!
Where's the money?
Where's the money?
What're you looking at?
I'm serious!
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.
The money's in here.
Let go of the girl!
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
Go away!
You're dragging me down!
Go home and raise pigs.
Go, before I kill you.
You!
Whatsyourname!
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!
-For real?
-Someone's waiting for you.
Brother Sum!
One look at you, and I knew you'd do anything.
Right!
You just needed your chance.
Damn right!
We've an assignment for you.
Anything, Brother Sum!
"Research on abnormal people." What's that?
A mental asylum.
soldiers!
Boy Scouts!
Tanks!
No worries.
When the Boy Scouts change shifts, you have exactly five minutes.
follow the arrows on the map.
Go to the Iast cell and get the man inside there out.
Here's your tools.
What about you guys?
We're your Iookouts.
Five minutes.
Hurry!
The world's top killer indeed looks the part!
It's only a title.
Cut the bullshit.
We want two people killed.
Name your price.
Name my what?
I've killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary.
So far, I've never found one.
That's why I stayed inside.
Had I met my match, I'd have been out long ago.
If you find me a worthy opponent I'II do it for free.
No charge!
Do you have someone?
Yes.
brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge.
But first, will you show us some moves?
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.
You numskuIIs aren't worthy!
He doesn't look the part.
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'II clean up well.
You sure you got the right guy?
absolutely.
I swear I did exactly what you told me.
please show us some moves, Mr. Beast.
Don't make it hard for me!
You dumb or what?
You know what this is, old man?
Ever seen a fist this big?
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!
really?
Try me, then.
Is he okay?
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
Harder!
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun!
In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
The real masters, together in one room!
only the world's top killer has such an aura.
Likewise.
could you two be the fated lovers...?
Paris and helen of Troy!
A pleasure, indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang and only the Axe Gang.
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
With the Beast here, Iet's see whose funeral it is!
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you or be killed by you.
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
Piece of cake.
I can handle this.
Good try, but a little off target.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
-Looks like they're not up to it!
-Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
-I'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
-Go to hell!
You!
Come over here.
-Hit him!
-Yes!
-The head!
-Of course!
-Hit him on the head!
-Okay.
-Here's your chance.
-Got it!
-Hit him!
-Hit him!
-Hit the shit out of him!
-Right!
-Hit him!
-Hit him!
Beat the shit out of him!
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused!
Wow, that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
No one gets away from me!
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at Ieast he finally made good.
Look at him!
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey, wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
There's no one here!
CHINESE MEDICINE
It's a miracle he lasted this long.
The herbs should help him.
herbal medicine can only partly help.
The key is his own body structure.
AII his bones and tendons are broken.
It's amazing he's recovering so fast.
It can't be possible....
unless he's....
What's that smell?
You mustn't smoke while you're hurt.
Let me handle this.
This makes no sense.
Who knew the Beast could clear the chi flow and thus unleash the boy's true potential?
We should've guessed.
He is the one!
Is this for real?
You're still alive, you turncoat?
kill him, men!
What kind of move is that?
Kids' stuff!
If our son were alive, he'd be his age now.
If he studies hard, he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer.
A stuntman, more likely!
Not bad.
Let's go.
I can even stop buIIets--
What?
The Toad style of the Kwan Lun school?
Oh, no!
Remember the palm move that faIIs from heaven?
That's the Iong lost Buddhist palm.
I surrender!
What kind of move was that?
If you want to Iearn, I'II teach you.
Master!
Hey!
tell him not to put snot on the glass.
You two, put your pants on!
No licking if you're not buying!
Kid, you have the bone structure of a kung-fu genius.
world peace is in your hands.
Here's the scroll of the Buddhist palm.
Because it's fate, I'II let you have it for $ 1 0.
Wait!
You want more...?
INSPECTOR CHAN
SUPER CRIME FIGHTERS
Anyone else?
Such a beautiful woman and you arrest her just for spitting?
Is there no justice?
Is there no law?
Commissioner is only your boss because he paid his dues to the Crocodile Gang.
And you don't fucking know me?
Sorry, I didn't know she was your wife.
Ugly coward!
What are you looking at?
Never seen such a handsome gang boss?
Who'd be in the film business?
It's Sunday, and the theater's deserted.
Where's the car?
Let's go back inside!
Call for help!
No need for that, Northerner.
While you were messing with the cop, your men signed up with us.
I'll kill all you Axe Gangsters!
Stop!
You forget the time I treated you to dinner.
Brother Sum.
Please....
Please spare me.
Don't worry.
I don't kill women.
You can go!
Thank you, Big Brother.
Cops!
Come clean up the mess!
THE AXE GANG
In a time of social unrest and disorder...
In a time of social unrest and disorder the gangs have moved in to consolidate their power.
The most feared of them all is the Axe Gang.
Only in the poorest districts, which hold no interest for the gangs..
...can people live in peace.

-That okay, Coolie?
-No problem!

NOODLES AND CONGEE
My check, please, Donut.
-How much?
-It's on the house!
Donut.
-It's nothing.
-I like you.
I'll ask the wife about lowering your rent.
Morning, Landlord!
Landlord!
Jill!
How you've grown!
Come let me examine you!
Good to see you, Landlord!
What's so good about it?
Don't...!
Can you make the skirt slit higher?
Sure!
Look, a comet!
Jane!
You naughty girl!
Landlord!
You're such a scoundrel!
Don't go, Jane!
Stay and chat!
I'm only kidding.
Jane!
Landlady!
Landlady!
What happened to the water?
Water ain't free!
You talk a lot for someone who won't pay his rent.
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.
You think that's a problem?
From now on, no water on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
I just love hearing you fools complain.
Assholes!
Good morning, Landlady!
Just pay your rent, or I'll burn your shop down.
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter, fairy!
Serves you right you're a coolie!
Months overdue and not even a "good morning."
You'll be a coolie for life.
There you go, handsome!
What took you so long with the congee?
I stopped to help an old lady cross the street.
-What are you doing here?
-Checking for Peeping Toms.
Was someone just spying on you, Auntie Six?
Don't shoot your mouth off without proof.
She's crazy.
Go away!
Please can you teach us, sir?
No more soccer!
-Who wants the cut?
-My boss.
Take a seat.
Done!
Fifty cents, please.
Isn't it great?
It's too good!
Why'd you make him look so good?
Why?
Don't get mad, boss.
He's my old buddy.
I'll handle this.
He's boss of the Axe Gang.
Don't you see the two axes?
We're bad guys.
Making him look good is really bad.
Understand?
-I didn't know.
-You're a numskull!
But I like you, so just pay me, and I'll take care of it.
No way!
Steady with the axe, boss.
Let me talk to him.
I really care for you.
You saw it for yourself.
Seriously.
Why don't you pay up.
Not much.
Enough for a drink.
Oh, so it's blackmail!
Boss!
Boss!
Now you're dead!
Looks like he's waking up!
I'm not afraid.
You can kill me.
But there'll be thousands more of me!
You want to play tough?
The Axe Gang boss is napping in there.
Whoever wants to die, step forward.
So you want to fight?
Great!
We'll go one-on-one.
Don't even think about cheating.
That old woman with the onion!
You look real tough.
Want to try me?
I'll let you hit me first.
What do you do?
I'm a farmer.
Farmers don't fight.
Piss off!
He's crazy!
Calling me names?
You're lucky you're a woman.
Hey, shorty!
Yeah, you!
If you're short, you don't retort.
What did I say about cheating?
Sit back down!
You!
The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.
No, not you.
I mean....
You!
Hey, kid, let's rumble!
All right, all right!
So no one-on-ones today.
You're all such wimps!
He blackmailed me.
Fat woman, you're in charge here, right?
Fat woman, my ass!
I'm with the Axe Gang!
Axe Gang, my ass!
Boss!
Boss, my ass!
-You have to pay our medical bills!
-Bills, my ass!
-We're on the same side!
-Same side, my ass!
Think you're so tough?
I'll call for backup!
You nitwit!
Let's see you call backup!
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.
Don't you go away!
Go put a down payment on your coffin!
Who threw the firecracker?
I'm one of you, brother.
Mind your own business!
It's raining.
Go bring in your laundry!
Fat woman!
You blackmailing me too?
I ain't afraid.
I....
Did anyone see what happened?
Don't!
My back's broken!
Call for help!
Hold on, calm down.
You hungry?
Keep quiet.
No.
Who did this?
I'll count to three.
One two....
I did it!
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?
Sorry!
Look away, kid.
Get rid of him!
We're the bad guys!
We're meant to do the ass-kicking not the other way around.
And it's all because these morons posed as Axes.
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.
We'll handle this.
You!
Take care of it.
-Boy, can this guy pick locks.
-It's a living.
Give me a break.
Pick that one too, if you're so good.
Come.
I'll count to three.
Hurry!
Ready?
Three!
That's quick!
Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will!
Go on!
Thank you, Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before, you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living!
The streets out there are filled with money and women.
You only need the will and determination to seize the opportunity to win.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone, and we're in the gang.
Then it'll be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars with no ambition.
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'll smash your glasses!
Get lost!
Come here and say that!
-You're really gonna kill someone?
-That's right!
The four-eyes, the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty.
But they're good at kung fu.
-I can do kung fu!
-Oh, yeah?
Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist Palm kung fu?
Hey there, handsome boy.
Stop.
Amazing!
Do you know you have a special aura?
You're so young, but you have the bone structure... and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.
If your chi flow can be channeled, then you will be invincible!
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.
The duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours.
Sure.
This is the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
It's priceless.
But as it's fate, I'll let you have it for $1 0.
buddhist PALM MANUAL
-You gave him your life savings?
-Yes.
I was saving to study to be a doctor or lawyer but this was world peace.
Let go of the girl!
Hey!
It's the Buddhist Palm!
"The 20-Cent Kung Fu Manual."
You must be loaded.
Have you killed anyone lately?
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
I realized then that good guys never win.
I want to be bad.
I want to be the killer!
-lce cream!
-Where?
Make mine a vanilla.
Chocolate for me!
What're you looking at?
Never seen free ice cream before?
Look at her run!
You're such kung-fu masters, go take it on the road.
You belong in the circus, not here!
Don't say that, Landlady.
There must be a reason they're here.
Everyone has his reasons.
We don't want to make trouble.
I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.
We'll never hear the end of it.
Why don't you get lost!
Your wife shouldn't be so nasty.
You okay?
Masters.
We have nothing precious to give you but take this as a token of our appreciation.
Thanks for saving us!
Stop the crying.
This isn't a show!
-You're so cold-hearted.
-Talking back to me, eh?
You may know kung fu, but you're still a fairy.
It's no crime to be good at kung fu!
Once a fairy, always a fairy.
Look at you.
What's with the red underwear?
Why not a diaper while you're at it.
What's wrong with red underwear?
Where were you when there was trouble?
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.
Be reasonable!
I'll reason with you.
You owe me three months' rent.
That's $90.
Pay up or pack up!
Don't you worry.
I'll pay it.
Think you're a smartass, Rabbit-Tooth Jane?
What's it to you, tub of lard?
Bitch!
Calm down, Landlady.
This is your fault.
-Are you trying to kill us?
-You're right.
How could you do that?
Shut the hell up!
You think you can out-yell me?
The fat lady can really sing.
Watch this!
What happened?
What do you mean, what happened?
You try it.
-Me?
-Quick!
Sorry!
You okay?
I think you should get closer and take better aim.
Okay?
Okay!
-Who's throwing the handles?
-Handle?
Where's the third knife?
God knows where it went.
Could it be the same one?
Can't be....
-Don't!
-Sorry.
What are you trying to say?
I just remembered I have something to do.
See you!
Uh-oh.
They've seen us!
Stay back!
Don't panic!
Snakes like music.
If I whistle, they won't bite.
Please, no more bright ideas.
Oh, what the hell!
Not you again, asshole!
Get back to your business!
Split up!
Split?
What're you doing here?
Looking for you.
Weren't you hurt?
I'm fine!
How come you always recover so fast?
I don't know.
-Which hospital did you go to?
-Don't remember.
Maybe it's better that way.
Memories can be painful.
To forget may be a blessing!
I never knew you were so deep.
All the sadness one can bear down the river everywhere.
Hey, get out of the way!
Move!
I'll slap you to kingdom come!
Look at those four-eyes carting around a coffin.
What morons!
Don't blame me for making you leave.
We'll let Buddha decide whether you stay or go.
HORRlFlCALLY BAD FATE
Have some tea.
We're grateful for some professional help.
We understand the problem.
Twelve Kicks from the Tam School Iron Fist from the Hung School and the Hexagon Staff....
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.
Their warrior days are long over but they're still top fighters.
This job is a great challenge for us.
Now, that's professionalism.
Number One Killers.
Expensive, yes, but worth every penny!
No!
Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer.
He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
Strictly speaking, we're just musicians.
A song that wrenches the heart O where do i find a knowing ear?
Great poem, isn't it?
We'll be saying goodbye soon.
Who knows when we'll see each other again.
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a lot to pack.
You're right.
Twelve Kicks of the Tam School!
Superb attack and defense!
Iron Fist: powerful yet delicate.
Topnotch!
Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves.
Mystical!
Till we meet again!
More lipstick!
Stay there, or I'll break you in half.
Sorry, we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material!
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories....
Insulting the Axe Gang!
We'll show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good!
Don't block my view!
Damn!
I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here.
-Really?
-Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry.
It's nothing!
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry, sorry!
Get out of my way!
Hang in there, Tailor.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the last we'll see of them.
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down!
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
People are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you I can now die in peace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.

Rest now.
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
I know you, four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-challenged.
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?
Help me!
"Help me!
Help me!" Want to play, punks?
The Dragon Style?
The Tiger Style?
Come down here, and I'll smash your glasses.
Come on!
You know I'd do it, right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes all because of you!

Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.
You numskulls aren't worthy!
He doesn't look the part.
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'll clean up well.
You sure you got the right guy?
Absolutely.
I swear I did exactly what you told me.
Please show us some moves, Mr. Beast.
Don't make it hard for me!
You dumb or what?
You know what this is, old man?
Ever seen a fist this big?
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!
Really?
Try me, then.
Is he okay?
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
Harder!
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun!
In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
The real masters, together in one room!
Only the world's top killer has such an aura.
Likewise.
Could you two be the fated lovers...?
Paris and Helen of Troy!
A pleasure, indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang and only the Axe Gang.
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
With the Beast here, let's see whose funeral it is!
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you or be killed by you.
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
Piece of cake.
I can handle this.
Good try, but a little off target.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
-Looks like they're not up to it!
-Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
-I'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
-Go to hell!
You!
Come over here.
-Hit him!
-Yes!
-The head!
-Of course!
-Hit him on the head!
-Okay.
-Here's your chance.
-Got it!
-Hit him!
-Hit him!
-Hit the shit out of him!
-Right!
-Hit him!
-Hit him!
Beat the shit out of him!
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused!
Wow, that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
No one gets away from me!
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at least he finally made good.
Look at him!
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey, wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
There's no one here!
chinese medicine
It's a miracle he lasted this long.
The herbs should help him.
Herbal medicine can only partly help.
The key is his own body structure.
All his bones and tendons are broken.
It's amazing he's recovering so fast.
It can't be possible....
Unless he's....
What's that smell?
You mustn't smoke while you're hurt.
Let me handle this.
This makes no sense.
Who knew the Beast could clear the chi flow and thus unleash the boy's true potential?
We should've guessed.
He is the one!
Is this for real?
You're still alive, you turncoat?
Kill him, men!
What kind of move is that?
Kids' stuff!
If our son were alive, he'd be his age now.
If he studies hard, he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer.
A stuntman, more likely!
Not bad.
Let's go.
I can even stop bullets--
What?
The Toad Style of the Kwan Lun School?
Oh, no!
Remember the Palm move that falls from heaven?
That's the long lost Buddhist Palm.
I surrender!
What kind of move was that?
If you want to learn, I'll teach you.
Master!
Hey!
Tell him not to put snot on the glass.
You two, put your pants on!
No licking if you're not buying!
Kid, you have the bone structure of a kung-fu genius.
World peace is in your hands.
Here's the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
Because it's fate, I'll let you have it for $1 0.
Wait!
You want more...?

Is there no law?
Commissioner is only your boss...
... becausehe paidhis dues to the Crocodile Gang.
And you don't fucking know me?
Sorry, I didn't know she was your wife.
Ugly coward !
What are you looking at?
Never seen such a handsome gang boss?
Who'd be in the film business?
It's Sunday, and the theatre's deserted.
Where's the car?
Let's go back inside!
Call for help!
No need for that, Northerner.
While you were messing with the cop, your men signed up with us.
I'll kill all you Axe Gangsters!
Stop!
You forget the time I treated you to dinner.
Brother Sum.
Please... .
Please spare me.
Don't worry.
I don't kill women.
You can go!
Thank you, Big Brother.

NOODLES AND CONGEE
My check, please, Donut.
-How much?
-It's on the house!
Donut.
-It's nothing.
-I like you.
I'll ask the wife about lowering your rent.
Morning, Landlord !
Landlord !
Jill !
How you've grown !
Come let me examine you !
Good to see you, Landlord !
What's so good about it?
Don't... !
Can you make the skirt slit higher?
Sure!
Look, a comet!
Jane!
You naughty girl !
Landlord !
You're such a scoundrel !
Don't go, Jane!
Stay and chat!
I'm only kidding.
Jane!
Landlady!
What happened to the water?
Water ain't free!
You talk a lot for someone who won't pay his rent.
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.
You think that's a problem?
From now on, no water on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
I just love hearing you fools complain.
Assholes!
Good morning, Landlady!
Just pay your rent, or I'll burn your shop down.
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter, fairy!
Serves you right you're a coolie!
Months overdue and not even a "good morning."
You'll be a coolie for life.
There you go, handsome!
What took you so long with the congee?
I stopped to help an old lady cross the street.
-What are you doing here?
-Checking for Peeping Toms.
Was someone just spying on you, Auntie Six?
Don't shoot your mouth off without proof.
She's crazy.
Go away!
Please can you teach us, sir?
No more soccer!
-Who wants the cut?
-My boss.
Take a seat.
Done!
Fifty cents, please.
Isn't it great?
It's too good !
Why'd you make him look so good?
Why?
Don't get mad, boss.
He's my old buddy.
I'll handle this.
He's boss of the Axe Gang.
Don't you see the two axes?
We're bad guys.
Making him look good is really bad.
Understand?
-I didn't know.
-You're a numskull !
But I like you, so just pay me, and I'll take care of it.
No way!
Steady with the axe, boss.
Let me talk to him.
I really care for you.
You saw it for yourself.
Seriously.
Why don't you pay up.
Not much.
Enough for a drink.
Oh, so it's blackmail !
Boss!
Now you're dead !
Looks like he's waking up!
I'm not afraid.
You can kill me.
But there'll be thousands more of me!
You want to play tough?
The Axe Gang boss is napping in there.
Whoever wants to die, step forward.
So you want to fight?
Great!
We'll go one-on-one.
Don't even think about cheating.
That old woman with the onion !
You look real tough.
Want to try me?
I'll let you hit me first.
What do you do?
I'm a farmer.
Farmers don't fight.
Piss off!
He's crazy!
Calling me names?
You're lucky you're a woman.
Hey, shorty!
Yeah, you !
If you're short, you don't retort.
What did I say about cheating?
Sit back down !
You !
The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.
No, not you.
I mean... .
You !
Hey, kid, let's rumble!
All right, all right!
So no one-on-ones today.
You're all such wimps!
He blackmailed me.
Fat woman, you're in charge here, right?
Fat woman, my ass!
I'm with the Axe Gang !
Axe Gang, my ass!
Boss!
Boss, my ass!
-You have to pay our medical bills!
-Bills, my ass!
-We're on the same side!
-Same side, my ass!
Think you're so tough?
I'll call for backup!
You nitwit!
Let's see you call backup!
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.
Don't you go away!
Go put a down payment on your coffin !
Who threw the firecracker?
I'm one of you, brother.
Mind your own business!
It's raining.
Go bring in your laundry!
Fat woman !
You blackmailing me too?
I ain't afraid.
I... .
Did anyone see what happened?
Don't!
My back's broken !
Call for help!
Hold on, calm down.
You hungry?
Keep quiet.
No.
Who did this?
I'll count to three.
One...
... two....
I did it!
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?
Sorry!
Look away, kid.
Get rid of him !
We're the bad guys!
We're meant to do the ass-kicking...
... nottheotherwayaround.
And it's all because these morons posed as Axes.
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.
We'll handle this.
You !
Take care of it.
-Boy, can this guy pick locks.
-It's a living.
Give me a break.
Pick that one too, if you're so good.
Come.
I'll count to three.
Hurry!
Ready?
Three!
That's quick!
Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will !
Go on !
Thank you, Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before, you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living !
The streets out there are filled with money and women.
You only need the will and determination...
... toseizetheopportunitytowin.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone, and we're in the gang.
Then it'll be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars...
... withnoambition.
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'll smash your glasses!
Get lost!
Come here and say that!
-You're really gonna kill someone?
-That's right!
The four-eyes, the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty.
But they're good at kung fu.
-I can do kung fu !
-Oh, yeah?
Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist Palm kung fu?
Hey there, handsome boy.
Stop.
Amazing !
Do you know you have a special aura?
You're so young, but you have the bone structure...
... andchiflowofa kung-fugenius.
If your chi flow can be channelled, then you will be invincible!
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.
The duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours.
Sure.
This is the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
It's priceless.
But as it's fate, I'll let you have it for $1 0.
BUDDHIST PALM MANUAL
-You gave him your life savings?
-Yes.
I was saving to study to be a doctor or lawyer...
... butthiswas worldpeace.
Let go of the girl !
Hey!
It's the Buddhist Palm !
"The 20-Cent Kung Fu Manual."
You must be loaded.
Have you killed anyone lately?
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
I realized then that good guys never win.
I want to be bad.
I want to be the killer!
-Ice cream !
-Where?
Make mine a vanilla.
Chocolate for me!
What're you looking at?
Never seen free ice cream before?
Look at her run !
You're such kung-fu masters, go take it on the road.
You belong in the circus, not here!
Don't say that, Landlady.
There must be a reason they're here.
Everyone has his reasons.
We don't want to make trouble.
I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.
We'll never hear the end of it.
Why don't you get lost!
Your wife shouldn't be so nasty.
You okay?
Masters.
We have nothing precious to give you...
... buttakethisasatoken of our appreciation.
Thanks for saving us!
Stop the crying.
This isn't a show!
-You're so cold-hearted.
-Talking back to me, eh?
You may know kung fu, but you're still a fairy.
It's no crime to be good at kung fu !
Once a fairy, always a fairy.
Look at you.
What's with the red underwear?
Why not a diaper while you're at it.
What's wrong with red underwear?
Where were you when there was trouble?
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.
Be reasonable!
I'll reason with you.
You owe me three months' rent.
That's $90.
Pay up or pack up!
Don't you worry.
I'll pay it.
Think you're a smartass, Rabbit-Tooth Jane?
What's it to you, tub of lard?
Bitch !
Calm down, Landlady.
This is your fault.
-Are you trying to kill us?
-You're right.
How could you do that?
Shut the hell up!
You think you can out-yell me?
The fat lady can really sing.
Watch this!
What happened?
What do you mean, what happened?
You try it.
-Me?
-Quick!
Sorry!
You okay?
I think you should get closer and take better aim.
Okay?
Okay!
-Who's throwing the handles?
-Handle?
Where's the third knife?
God knows where it went.
Could it be the same one?
Can't be... .
-Don't!
-Sorry.
What are you trying to say?
I just remembered I have something to do.
See you !
Uh-oh.
They've seen us!
Stay back!
Don't panic!
Snakes like music.
If I whistle, they won't bite.
Please, no more bright ideas.
Oh, what the hell !
Not you again, asshole!
Get back to your business!
Split up!
Split?
What're you doing here?
Looking for you.
Weren't you hurt?
I'm fine!
How come you always recover so fast?
I don't know.
-Which hospital did you go to?
-Don't remember.
Maybe it's better that way.
Memories can be painful.
To forget may be a blessing !
I never knew you were so deep.
All the sadness one can bear...
... downtherivereverywhere.
Hey, get out of the way!
Move!
I'll slap you to kingdom come!
Look at those four-eyes carting around a coffin.
What morons!
Don't blame me for making you leave.
We'll let Buddha decide...
... whetheryoustay...
... orgo.
HORRIFICALLY BAD FATE
Have some tea.
We're grateful for some professional help.
We understand the problem.
Twelve Kicks from the Tam School...
... IronFistfromtheHungSchool and the Hexagon Staff... .
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.
Their warrior days are long over...
... butthey'restilltopfighters.
This job is a great challenge for us.
Now, that's professionalism.
Number One Killers.
Expensive, yes, but worth every penny!
No!
Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer.
He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
Strictly speaking, we're just musicians.
A song that wrenches the heart O where do I find a knowing ear?
Great poem, isn't it?
We'll be saying goodbye soon.
Who knows when we'll see each other again.
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a lot to pack.
You're right.
Twelve Kicks of the Tam School !
Superb attack and defence!
Iron Fist: powerful yet delicate.
Top-notch !
Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves.
Mystical !
Till we meet again !
More lipstick!
Stay there, or I'll break you in half.
Sorry, we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material !
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories... .
Insulting the Axe Gang !
We'll show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good !
Don't block my view!
Damn !
I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here.
-Really?
-Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry.
It's nothing !
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry, sorry!
Get out of my way!
Hang in there, Tailor.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the last we'll see of them.
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down !
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
People are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you...
... I cannowdie inpeace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.
Years ago...
... wesawouronlyson killed in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters...
... andwe'llavengethem!
Becoming a top fighter takes time.
Unless you're a natural-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.
It's obvious I'm the one!
Don't think so.
Everyone!
We swore we'd never fight again.
But we broke that promise today.
For your own safety, please all leave!
In great power lies great responsibility.
There's no escaping from it.
Donut, you're hurt bad.
Rest now.
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
I know you, four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-challenged.
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?
Help me!
"Help me!
Help me!" Want to play, punks?
The Dragon Style?
The Tiger Style?
Come down here, and I'll smash your glasses.
Come on !
You know I'd do it, right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes...
... allbecauseof you!
You're a numb-nut!
Follow me!
It's a stickup!
Where's the money?
Where's the money?
What're you looking at?
I'm serious!
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.
The money's in here.
Let go of the girl !
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
Go away!
You're dragging me down !
Go home and raise pigs.
Go, before I kill you.
You !
Whatsyourname!
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!
-For real?
-Someone's waiting for you.
Brother Sum !
One look at you, and I knew you'd do anything.
Right!
You just needed your chance.
Damn right!
We've an assignment for you.
Anything, Brother Sum !
"Research on abnormal people." What's that?
A mental asylum.
Soldiers!
Boy Scouts!
Tanks!
No worries.
When the Boy Scouts change shifts, you have exactly five minutes.
Follow the arrows on the map.
Go to the last cell...
... andgettheman insidethereout.
Here's your tools.
What about you guys?
We're your lookouts.
Five minutes.
Hurry!
The world's top killer indeed looks the part!
It's only a title.
Cut the bullshit.
We want two people killed.
Name your price.
Name my what?
I've killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary.
So far, I've never found one.
That's why I stayed inside.
Had I met my match, I'd have been out long ago.
If you find me a worthy opponent...
... I 'lldoit forfree.
Nocharge!
Do you have someone?
Yes.
Brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge.
But first, will you show us some moves?
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.
You numskulls aren't worthy!
He doesn't look the part.
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'll clean up well.
You sure you got the right guy?
Absolutely.
I swear I did exactly what you told me.
Please show us some moves, Mr. Beast.
Don't make it hard for me!
You dumb or what?
You know what this is, old man?
Ever seen a fist this big?
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!
Really?
Try me, then.
Is he okay?
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun !
In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
The real masters, together in one room !

Could you two be the fated lovers... ?
Paris...

A pleasure, indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang...
... andonlytheAxe Gang.
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
With the Beast here, let's see whose funeral it is!
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you...
... orbekilledbyyou.
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
Piece of cake.
I can handle this.
Good try, but a little off target.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
-Looks like they're not up to it!
-Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
-I'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
-Go to hell !
You !
Come over here.
-Hit him !
-Yes!
-The head !
-Of course!
-Hit him on the head !
-Okay.
-Here's your chance.
-Got it!
-Hit him !
-Hit him !
-Hit the shit out of him !
-Right!
-Hit him !
-Hit him !
Beat the shit out of him !
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused !
Wow, that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
No one gets away from me!
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at least he finally made good.
Look at him !
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey, wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
There's no one here!

Is there no justice?
Is there no law?
Commissioner is only your boss because he paid his dues to the Crocodile Gang.
And you don't fucking know me?
Sorry, I didn't know she was your wife.
Ugly coward!
What are you looking at?
Never seen such a handsome gang boss?
Who'd be in the film business?
It's Sunday, and the theater's deserted.
Where's the car?
Let's go back inside!
Call for help!
No need for that, Northerner.
While you were messing with the cop, your men signed up with us.
I'll kill all you Axe Gangsters!
Stop!
You forget the time I treated you to dinner.
Brother Sum.
Please...
Please spare me.
Don't worry.
I don't kill women.
You can go!
Thank you, Big Brother.
Cops!
Come clean up the mess!
THE AXE GANG
In a time of social unrest and disorder...
In a time of social unrest and disorder the gangs have moved in to consolidate their power.
The most feared of them all is the Axe Gang.
Only in the poorest districts, which hold no interest for the gangs can people live in peace.

NOODLES AND CONGEE
My check, please, Donut.
- How much?
- It's on the house!
Donut.
- It's nothing.
- I like you.
I'll ask the wife about lowering your rent.
Morning, Landlord!
Landlord!
Jill!
How you've grown!
Come let me examine you!
Good to see you, Landlord!
What's so good about it?
Don't...!
Can you make the skirt slit higher?
Sure!
Look, a comet!
Jane!
You naughty girl!
Landlord!
You're such a scoundrel!
Don't go, Jane!
Stay and chat!
I'm only kidding.
Jane!
Landlady!
Landlady!
What happened to the water?
Water ain't free!
You talk a lot for someone who won't pay his rent.
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.
You think that's a problem?
From now on, no water on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
I just love hearing you fools complain.
Assholes!
Good morning, Landlady!
Just pay your rent, or I'll burn your shop down.
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter, fairy!
Serves you right you're a coolie!
Months overdue and not even a "good morning."
You'll be a coolie for life.
There you go, handsome!
What took you so long with the congee?
I stopped to help an old lady cross the street.
- What are you doing here?
- Checking for Peeping Toms.
Was someone just spying on you, Auntie Six?
Don't shoot your mouth off without proof.
She's crazy.
Go away!
Please can you teach us, sir?
No more soccer!
- Who wants the cut?
- My boss.
Take a seat.
Done!
Fifty cents, please.
Isn't it great?
It's too good!
Why'd you make him look so good?
Why?
Don't get mad, boss.
He's my old buddy.
I'll handle this.
He's boss of the Axe Gang.
Don't you see the two axes?
We're bad guys.
Making him look good is really bad.
Understand?
- I didn't know.
- You're a numskull!
But I like you, so just pay me, and I'll take care of it.
No way!
Steady with the axe, boss.
Let me talk to him.
I really care for you.
You saw it for yourself.
Seriously.
Why don't you pay up.
Not much.
Enough for a drink.
Oh, so it's blackmail!
Boss!
Boss!
Now you're dead!
Looks like he's waking up!
I'm not afraid.
You can kill me.
But there'll be thousands more of me!
You want to play tough?
The Axe Gang boss is napping in there.
Whoever wants to die, step forward.
So you want to fight?
Great!
We'll go one-on-one.
Don't even think about cheating.
That old woman with the onion!
You look real tough.
Want to try me?
I'll let you hit me first.
What do you do?
I'm a farmer.
Farmers don't fight.
Piss off!
He's crazy!
Calling me names?
You're lucky you're a woman.
Hey, shorty!
Yeah, you!
If you're short, you don't retort.
What did I say about cheating?
Sit back down!
You!
The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.
No, not you.
I mean...
You!
Hey, kid, let's rumble!
All right, all right!
So no one-on-ones today.
You're all such wimps!
He blackmailed me.
Fat woman, you're in charge here, right?
Fat woman, my ass!
I'm with the Axe Gang!
Axe Gang, my ass!
Boss!
Boss, my ass!
- You have to pay our medical bills!
- Bills, my ass!
- We're on the same side!
- Same side, my ass!
Think you're so tough?
I'll call for backup!
You nitwit!
Let's see you call backup!
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.
Don't you go away!
Go put a down payment on your coffin!
Who threw the firecracker?
I'm one of you, brother.
Mind your own business!
It's raining.
Go bring in your laundry!
Fat woman!
You blackmailing me too?
I ain't afraid.
I...
Did anyone see what happened?
Don't!
My back's broken!
Call for help!
Hold on, calm down.
You hungry?
Keep quiet.
No.
Who did this?
I'll count to three.
One two...
I did it!
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?
Sorry!
Look away, kid.
Get rid of him!
We're the bad guys!
We're meant to do the ass-kicking not the other way around.
And it's all because these morons posed as Axes.
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.
We'll handle this.
You!
Take care of it.
- Boy, can this guy pick locks.
- It's a living.
Give me a break.
Pick that one too, if you're so good.
Come.
I'll count to three.
Hurry!
Ready?
Three!
That's quick!
Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will!
Go on!
Thank you, Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before, you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living!
The streets out there are filled with money and women.
You only need the will and determination to seize the opportunity to win.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone, and we're in the gang.
Then it'll be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars with no ambition.
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'll smash your glasses!
Get lost!
Come here and say that!
- You're really gonna kill someone?
- That's right!
The four-eyes, the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty.
But they're good at kung fu.
- I can do kung fu!
- Oh, yeah?
Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist Palm kung fu?
Hey there, handsome boy.
Stop.
Amazing!
Do you know you have a special aura?
You're so young, but you have the bone structure... and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.
If your chi flow can be channeled, then you will be invincible!
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.
The duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours.
Sure.
This is the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
It's priceless.
But as it's fate, I'll let you have it for $ 10.
BUDDHIST PALM MANUAL
- You gave him your life savings?
- Yes.
I was saving to study to be a doctor or lawyer but this was world peace.
Let go of the girl!
Hey!
It's the Buddhist Palm!
"The 20-Cent Kung Fu Manual."
You must be loaded.
Have you killed anyone lately?
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
I realized then that good guys never win.
I want to be bad.
I want to be the killer!
- Ice cream!
- Where?
Make mine a vanilla.
Chocolate for me!
What're you looking at?
Never seen free ice cream before?
Look at her run!
You're such kung-fu masters, go take it on the road.
You belong in the circus, not here!
Don't say that, Landlady.
There must be a reason they're here.
Everyone has his reasons.
We don't want to make trouble.
I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.
We'll never hear the end of it.
Why don't you get lost!
Your wife shouldn't be so nasty.
You okay?
Masters.
We have nothing precious to give you but take this as a token of our appreciation.
Thanks for saving us!
Stop the crying.
This isn't a show!
- You're so cold-hearted.
- Talking back to me, eh?
You may know kung fu, but you're still a fairy.
It's no crime to be good at kung fu!
Once a fairy, always a fairy.
Look at you.
What's with the red underwear?
Why not a diaper while you're at it.
What's wrong with red underwear?
Where were you when there was trouble?
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.
Be reasonable!
I'll reason with you.
You owe me three months' rent.
That's $90.
Pay up or pack up!
Don't you worry.
I'll pay it.
Think you're a smartass, Rabbit-Tooth Jane?
What's it to you, tub of lard?
Bitch!
Calm down, Landlady.
This is your fault.
- Are you trying to kill us?
- You're right.
How could you do that?
Shut the hell up!
You think you can out-yell me?
The fat lady can really sing.
Watch this!
What happened?
What do you mean, what happened?
You try it.
- Me?
- Quick!
Sorry!
You okay?
I think you should get closer and take better aim.
Okay?
Okay!
- Who's throwing the handles?
- Handle?
Where's the third knife?
God knows where it went.
Could it be the same one?
Can't be...
- Don't!
- Sorry.
What are you trying to say?
I just remembered I have something to do.
See you!
Uh-oh.
They've seen us!
Stay back!
Don't panic!
Snakes like music.
If I whistle, they won't bite.
Please, no more bright ideas.
Oh, what the hell!
Not you again, asshole!
Get back to your business!
Split up!
Split?
What're you doing here?
Looking for you.
Weren't you hurt?
I'm fine!
How come you always recover so fast?
I don't know.
- Which hospital did you go to?
- Don't remember.
Maybe it's better that way.
Memories can be painful.
To forget may be a blessing!
I never knew you were so deep.
All the sadness one can bear down the river everywhere.
Hey, get out of the way!
Move!
I'll slap you to kingdom come!
Look at those four-eyes carting around a coffin.
What morons!
Don't blame me for making you leave.
We'll let Buddha decide whether you stay or go.
HORRIFICALLY BAD FATE
Have some tea.
We're grateful for some professional help.
We understand the problem.
Twelve Kicks from the Tam School Iron Fist from the Hung School and the Hexagon Staff...
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.
Their warrior days are long over but they're still top fighters.
This job is a great challenge for us.
Now, that's professionalism.
Number One Killers.
Expensive, yes, but worth every penny!
No!
Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer.
He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
Strictly speaking, we're just musicians.
A song that wrenches the heart O where do I find a knowing ear?
Great poem, isn't it?
We'll be saying goodbye soon.
Who knows when we'll see each other again.
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a lot to pack.
You're right.
Twelve Kicks of the Tam School!
Superb attack and defense!
Iron Fist:
Powerful yet delicate.
Topnotch!
Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves.
Mystical!
Till we meet again!
More lipstick!
Stay there, or I'll break you in half.
Sorry, we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material!
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories...
Insulting the Axe Gang!
We'll show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good!
Don't block my view!
Damn!
I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry.
It's nothing!
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry, sorry!
Get out of my way!
Hang in there, Tailor.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the last we'll see of them.
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down!
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
People are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you I can now die in peace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.
Years ago we saw our only son killed in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters and we'll avenge them!
Becoming a top fighter takes time.
Unless you're a natural-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.
It's obvious I'm the one!
Don't think so.
Everyone!
We swore we'd never fight again.
But we broke that promise today.
For your own safety, please all leave!
In great power lies great responsibility.
There's no escaping from it.
Donut, you're hurt bad.
Rest now.
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
I know you, four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-challenged.
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?
Help me!
"Help me!
Help me!" Want to play, punks?
The Dragon Style?
The Tiger Style?
Come down here, and I'll smash your glasses.
Come on!
You know I'd do it, right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes all because of you!
You're a numb-nut!
Follow me!
It's a stickup!
Where's the money?
Where's the money?
What're you looking at?
I'm serious!
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.
The money's in here.
Let go of the girl!
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
Go away!
You're dragging me down!
Go home and raise pigs.
Go, before I kill you.
You!
Whatsyourname!
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!
- For real?
- Someone's waiting for you.
Brother Sum!
One look at you, and I knew you'd do anything.
Right!
You just needed your chance.
Damn right!
We've an assignment for you.
Anything, Brother Sum!
"Research on abnormal people." What's that?
A mental asylum.
Soldiers!
Boy Scouts!
Tanks!
No worries.
When the Boy Scouts change shifts, you have exactly five minutes.
Follow the arrows on the map.
Go to the last cell and get the man inside there out.
Here's your tools.
What about you guys?
We're your lookouts.
Five minutes.
Hurry!
The world's top killer indeed looks the part!
It's only a title.
Cut the bullshit.
We want two people killed.
Name your price.
Name my what?
I've killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary.
So far, I've never found one.
That's why I stayed inside.
Had I met my match, I'd have been out long ago.
If you find me a worthy opponent I'll do it for free.
No charge!
Do you have someone?
Yes.
Brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge.
But first, will you show us some moves?
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.
You numskulls aren't worthy!
He doesn't look the part.
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'll clean up well.
You sure you got the right guy?
Absolutely.
I swear I did exactly what you told me.
Please show us some moves, Mr. Beast.
Don't make it hard for me!
You dumb or what?
You know what this is, old man?
Ever seen a fist this big?
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!
Really?
Try me, then.
Is he okay?
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
Harder!
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun!
In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
The real masters, together in one room!
Only the world's top killer has such an aura.
Likewise.
Could you two be the fated lovers...?
Paris and Helen of Troy!
A pleasure, indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang and only the Axe Gang.
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
With the Beast here, let's see whose funeral it is!
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you or be killed by you.
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
Piece of cake.
I can handle this.
Good try, but a little off target.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
- Looks like they're not up to it!
- Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
- I'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
- Go to hell!
You!
Come over here.
- Hit him!
- Yes!
- The head!
- Of course!
- Hit him on the head!
- Okay.
- Here's your chance.
- Got it!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
- Hit the shit out of him!
- Right!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
Beat the shit out of him!
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused!
Wow, that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
No one gets away from me!
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at least he finally made good.
Look at him!
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey, wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
There's no one here!
CHINESE MEDICINE
It's a miracle he lasted this long.
The herbs should help him.
Herbal medicine can only partly help.
The key is his own body structure.
All his bones and tendons are broken.
It's amazing he's recovering so fast.
It can't be possible...
Unless he's...
What's that smell?
You mustn't smoke while you're hurt.
Let me handle this.
This makes no sense.
Who knew the Beast could clear the chi flow and thus unleash the boy's true potential?
We should've guessed.
He is the one!
Is this for real?
You're still alive, you turncoat?
Kill him, men!
What kind of move is that?
Kids' stuff!
If our son were alive, he'd be his age now.
If he studies hard, he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer.
A stuntman, more likely!
Not bad.
Let's go.
I can even stop bullets...
What?
The Toad Style of the Kwan Lun School?
Oh, no!
Remember the Palm move that falls from heaven?
That's the long lost Buddhist Palm.
I surrender!
What kind of move was that?
If you want to learn, I'll teach you.
Master!
Hey!
Tell him not to put snot on the glass.
You two, put your pants on!
No licking if you're not buying!
Kid, you have the bone structure of a kung-fu genius.
World peace is in your hands.
Here's the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
Because it's fate, I'll let you have it for $ 10.
Wait!
You want more...?

Anyone else?
Such a beautiful woman and you arrest her just for spitting?
Is there no justice?
Is there no law?
Commissioner is only your boss because he paid his dues to the Crocodile Gang.
And you don't fucking know me?
Sorry, I didn't know she was your wife.
Ugly coward!
What are you looking at?
Never seen such a handsome gang boss?
Who'd be in the film business?
It's Sunday, and the theater's deserted.
Where's the car?
Let's go back inside!
Call for help!
No need for that, Northerner.
While you were messing with the cop, your men signed up with us.
I'll kill all you Axe Gangsters!
Stop!
You forget the time I treated you to dinner.
Brother Sum.
Please...
Please spare me.
Don't worry.
I don't kill women.
You can go!
Thank you, Big Brother.

Come clean up the mess!

That's quick!
Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will!
Go on!
Thank you, Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before, you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living!
The streets out there are filled with money and women.
You only need the will and determination to seize the opportunity to win.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone, and we're in the gang.
Then it'll be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars with no ambition.
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'll smash your glasses!
Get lost!
Come here and say that!
- You're really gonna kill someone?
- That's right!
The four-eyes, the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty.
But they're good at kung fu.
- I can do kung fu!
- Oh, yeah?
Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist Palm kung fu?
Hey there, handsome boy.
Stop.
Amazing!
Do you know you have a special aura?
You're so young, but you have the bone structure... and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.
If your chi flow can be channeled, then you will be invincible!
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.
The duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours.
Sure.
This is the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
It's priceless.
But as it's fate, I'll let you have it for $ 10.
BUDDHIST PALM MANUAL
- You gave him your life savings?
- Yes.
I was saving to study to be a doctor or lawyer but this was world peace.
Let go of the girl!
Hey!
It's the Buddhist Palm!
"The 20-Cent Kung Fu Manual."
You must be loaded.
Have you killed anyone lately?
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
I realized then that good guys never win.
I want to be bad.
I want to be the killer!
- Ice cream!
- Where?
Make mine a vanilla.
Chocolate for me!
What're you looking at?
Never seen free ice cream before?
Look at her run!
You're such kung-fu masters, go take it on the road.
You belong in the circus, not here!
Don't say that, Landlady.
There must be a reason they're here.
Everyone has his reasons.
We don't want to make trouble.
I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.
We'll never hear the end of it.
Why don't you get lost!
Your wife shouldn't be so nasty.
You okay?
Masters.
We have nothing precious to give you but take this as a token of our appreciation.
Thanks for saving us!
Stop the crying.
This isn't a show!
- You're so cold-hearted.
- Talking back to me, eh?
You may know kung fu, but you're still a fairy.
It's no crime to be good at kung fu!
Once a fairy, always a fairy.
Look at you.
What's with the red underwear?
Why not a diaper while you're at it.
What's wrong with red underwear?
Where were you when there was trouble?
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.
Be reasonable!
I'll reason with you.
You owe me three months' rent.
That's $90.
Pay up or pack up!
Don't you worry.
I'll pay it.
Think you're a smartass, Rabbit-Tooth Jane?
What's it to you, tub of lard?
Bitch!
Calm down, Landlady.
This is your fault.
- Are you trying to kill us?
- You're right.
How could you do that?
Shut the hell up!
You think you can out-yell me?
The fat lady can really sing.
Watch this!
What happened?
What do you mean, what happened?
You try it.
- Me?
- Quick!
Sorry!
You okay?
I think you should get closer and take better aim.
Okay?
Okay!
- Who's throwing the handles?
- Handle?
Where's the third knife?
God knows where it went.
Could it be the same one?
Can't be...
- Don't!
- Sorry.
What are you trying to say?
I just remembered I have something to do.
See you!
Uh-oh.
They've seen us!
Stay back!
Don't panic!
Snakes like music.
If I whistle, they won't bite.
Please, no more bright ideas.
Oh, what the hell!
Not you again, asshole!
Get back to your business!
Split up!
Split?
What're you doing here?
Looking for you.
Weren't you hurt?
I'm fine!
How come you always recover so fast?
I don't know.
- Which hospital did you go to?
- Don't remember.
Maybe it's better that way.
Memories can be painful.
To forget may be a blessing!
I never knew you were so deep.
All the sadness one can bear down the river everywhere.
Hey, get out of the way!
Move!
I'll slap you to kingdom come!
Look at those four-eyes carting around a coffin.
What morons!
Don't blame me for making you leave.
We'll let Buddha decide whether you stay or go.
HORRIFICALLY BAD FATE
Have some tea.
We're grateful for some professional help.
We understand the problem.
Twelve Kicks from the Tam School Iron Fist from the Hung School and the Hexagon Staff...
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.
Their warrior days are long over but they're still top fighters.
This job is a great challenge for us.
Now, that's professionalism.
Number One Killers.
Expensive, yes, but worth every penny!
No!
Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer.
He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
Strictly speaking, we're just musicians.
A song that wrenches the heart O where do I find a knowing ear?
Great poem, isn't it?
We'll be saying goodbye soon.
Who knows when we'll see each other again.
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a lot to pack.
You're right.
Twelve Kicks of the Tam School!
Superb attack and defense!
Iron Fist: powerful yet delicate.
Topnotch!
Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves.
Mystical!
Till we meet again!
More lipstick!
Stay there, or I'll break you in half.
Sorry, we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material!
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories...
Insulting the Axe Gang!
We'll show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good!
Don't block my view!
Damn!
I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry.
It's nothing!
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry, sorry!
Get out of my way!
Hang in there, Tailor.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the last we'll see of them.
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down!
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
People are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you I can now die in peace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.
Years ago we saw our only son killed in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters and we'll avenge them!
Becoming a top fighter takes time.
Unless you're a natural-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.
It's obvious I'm the one!
Don't think so.
Everyone!
We swore we'd never fight again.
But we broke that promise today.
For your own safety, please all leave!
In great power lies great responsibility.
There's no escaping from it.
Donut, you're hurt bad.
Rest now.
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
I know you, four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-challenged.
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?
Help me!
"Help me!
Help me!" Want to play, punks?
The Dragon Style?
The Tiger Style?
Come down here, and I'll smash your glasses.
Come on!
You know I'd do it, right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes all because of you!
You're a numb-nut!
Follow me!
It's a stickup!
Where's the money?
Where's the money?
What're you looking at?
I'm serious!
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.
The money's in here.
Let go of the girl!
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
Go away!
You're dragging me down!
Go home and raise pigs.
Go, before I kill you.
You!
Whatsyourname!
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!
- For real?
- Someone's waiting for you.
Brother Sum!
One look at you, and I knew you'd do anything.
Right!
You just needed your chance.
Damn right!
We've an assignment for you.
Anything, Brother Sum!
"Research on abnormal people." What's that?
A mental asylum.
Soldiers!
Boy Scouts!
Tanks!
No worries.
When the Boy Scouts change shifts, you have exactly five minutes.
Follow the arrows on the map.
Go to the last cell and get the man inside there out.
Here's your tools.
What about you guys?
We're your lookouts.
Five minutes.
Hurry!
The world's top killer indeed looks the part!
It's only a title.
Cut the bullshit.
We want two people killed.
Name your price.
Name my what?
I've killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary.
So far, I've never found one.
That's why I stayed inside.
Had I met my match, I'd have been out long ago.
If you find me a worthy opponent I'll do it for free.
No charge!
Do you have someone?
Yes.
Brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge.
But first, will you show us some moves?
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.
You numskulls aren't worthy!
He doesn't look the part.
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'll clean up well.
You sure you got the right guy?
Absolutely.
I swear I did exactly what you told me.
Please show us some moves, Mr. Beast.
Don't make it hard for me!
You dumb or what?
You know what this is, old man?
Ever seen a fist this big?
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!
Really?
Try me, then.
Is he okay?
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
Harder!
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun!
In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
The real masters, together in one room!
Only the world's top killer has such an aura.
Likewise.
Could you two be the fated lovers...?
Paris and Helen of Troy!
A pleasure, indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang and only the Axe Gang.
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
With the Beast here, let's see whose funeral it is!
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you or be killed by you.
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
Piece of cake.
I can handle this.
Good try, but a little off target.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
- Looks like they're not up to it!
- Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
- I'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
- Go to hell!
You!
Come over here.
- Hit him!
- Yes!
- The head!
- Of course!
- Hit him on the head!
- Okay.
- Here's your chance.
- Got it!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
- Hit the shit out of him!
- Right!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
Beat the shit out of him!
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused!
Wow, that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
No one gets away from me!
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at least he finally made good.
Look at him!
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey, wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
There's no one here!
CHINESE MEDICINE
It's a miracle he lasted this long.
The herbs should help him.
Herbal medicine can only partly help.
The key is his own body structure.
All his bones and tendons are broken.
It's amazing he's recovering so fast.
It can't be possible...
Unless he's...
What's that smell?
You mustn't smoke while you're hurt.
Let me handle this.
This makes no sense.
Who knew the Beast could clear the chi flow and thus unleash the boy's true potential?
We should've guessed.
He is the one!
Is this for real?
You're still alive, you turncoat?
Kill him, men!
What kind of move is that?
Kids' stuff!
If our son were alive, he'd be his age now.
If he studies hard, he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer.
A stuntman, more likely!
Not bad.
Let's go.
I can even stop bullets...
What?
The Toad Style of the Kwan Lun School?
Oh, no!
Remember the Palm move that falls from heaven?
That's the long lost Buddhist Palm.
I surrender!
What kind of move was that?
If you want to learn, I'll teach you.
Master!
Hey!
Tell him not to put snot on the glass.
You two, put your pants on!
No licking if you're not buying!
Kid, you have the bone structure of a kung-fu genius.
World peace is in your hands.
Here's the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
Because it's fate, I'll let you have it for $ 10.
Wait!
You want more...?
INSPECTOR CHAN
SUPER CRIME FIGHTERS
Anyone else?
Such a beautiful woman and you arrest her just for spitting?
Is there no justice?
Is there no law?
Commissioner is only your boss because he paid his dues to the crocodile Gang.
And you don't fucking know me?
Sorry, I didn't know she was your wife.
ugly coward!
What are you looking at?
Never seen such a handsome gang boss?
Who'd be in the film business?
It's Sunday, and the theater's deserted.
Where's the car?
Let's go back inside!
call for help!
No need for that, Northerner.
while you were messing with the cop, your men signed up with us.
I'II kill all you Axe Gangsters!
Stop!
You forget the time I treated you to dinner.
Brother Sum.
please....
please spare me.
Don't worry.
I don't kill women.
You can go!
Thank you, Big Brother.
Cops!
Come clean up the mess!
THE AXE GANG
In a time of social unrest and disorder...
In a time of social unrest and disorder the gangs have moved in to consolidate their power.
The most feared of them all is the Axe Gang.
only in the poorest districts, which hold no interest for the gangs..
...can people live in peace.

-No problem!
TAILOR
NOODLES AND CONGEE
My check, please, Donut.
-How much?
-It's on the house!
Donut.
-It's nothing.
-I Iike you.
I'II ask the wife about lowering your rent.
Morning, landlord!
landlord!
jill!
How you've grown!
Come let me examine you!
Good to see you, landlord!
What's so good about it?
Don't...!
Can you make the skirt slit higher?
Sure!
Look, a comet!
Jane!
You naughty girl!
landlord!
You're such a scoundrel!
Don't go, Jane!
Stay and chat!
I'm only kidding.
Jane!
LandIady!
LandIady!
What happened to the water?
Water ain't free!
You talk a Iot for someone who won't pay his rent.
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.
You think that's a problem?
From now on, no water on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
I just love hearing you fools complain.
assholes!
Good morning, LandIady!
Just pay your rent, or I'II burn your shop down.
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter, fairy!
Serves you right you're a coolie!
Months overdue and not even a "good morning."
You'II be a coolie for life.
There you go, handsome!
What took you so long with the congee?
I stopped to help an old lady cross the street.
-What are you doing here?
-Checking for Peeping Toms.
Was someone just spying on you, Auntie Six?
Don't shoot your mouth off without proof.
She's crazy.
Go away!
please can you teach us, sir?
No more soccer!
-Who wants the cut?
-My boss.
Take a seat.
Done!
Fifty cents, please.
Isn't it great?
It's too good!
Why'd you make him look so good?
Why?
Don't get mad, boss.
He's my old buddy.
I'II handle this.
He's boss of the Axe Gang.
Don't you see the two axes?
We're bad guys.
Making him look good is really bad.
Understand?
-I didn't know.
-You're a numskull!
But I Iike you, so just pay me, and I'II take care of it.
No way!
Steady with the axe, boss.
Let me talk to him.
I really care for you.
You saw it for yourself.
seriously.
Why don't you pay up.
Not much.
Enough for a drink.
Oh, so it's blackmail!
Boss!
Boss!
Now you're dead!
Looks like he's waking up!
I'm not afraid.
You can kill me.
But there'II be thousands more of me!
You want to play tough?
The Axe Gang boss is napping in there.
Whoever wants to die, step forward.
So you want to fight?
Great!
We'II go one-on-one.
Don't even think about cheating.
That old woman with the onion!
You look real tough.
Want to try me?
I'II let you hit me first.
What do you do?
I'm a farmer.
Farmers don't fight.
Piss off!
He's crazy!
calling me names?
You're lucky you're a woman.
Hey, shorty!
Yeah, you!
If you're short, you don't retort.
What did I say about cheating?
Sit back down!
You!
The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.
No, not you.
I mean....
You!
Hey, kid, Iet's rumble!
AII right, all right!
So no one-on-ones today.
You're all such wimps!
He blackmailed me.
Fat woman, you're in charge here, right?
Fat woman, my ass!
I'm with the Axe Gang!
Axe Gang, my ass!
Boss!
Boss, my ass!
-You have to pay our medical bills!
-bills, my ass!
-We're on the same side!
-Same side, my ass!
Think you're so tough?
I'II call for backup!
You nitwit!
Let's see you call backup!
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.
Don't you go away!
Go put a down payment on your coffin!
Who threw the firecracker?
I'm one of you, brother.
Mind your own business!
It's raining.
Go bring in your laundry!
Fat woman!
You bIackmaiIing me too?
I ain't afraid.
I....
Did anyone see what happened?
Don't!
My back's broken!
call for help!
hold on, calm down.
You hungry?
Keep quiet.
No.
Who did this?
I'II count to three.
One two....
I did it!
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?
Sorry!
Look away, kid.
Get rid of him!
We're the bad guys!
We're meant to do the ass-kicking not the other way around.
And it's all because these morons posed as Axes.
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.
We'II handle this.
You!
Take care of it.
-Boy, can this guy pick locks.
-It's a living.
Give me a break.
Pick that one too, if you're so good.
Come.
I'II count to three.
Hurry!
Ready?
Three!
That's quick!
Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will!
Go on!
Thank you, Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before, you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living!

You only need the will and determination to seize the opportunity to win.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone, and we're in the gang.
Then it'II be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars with no ambition.
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'II smash your glasses!
Get lost!
Come here and say that!
-You're really gonna kill someone?
-That's right!
The four-eyes, the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty.
But they're good at kung fu.
-I can do kung fu!
-Oh, yeah?
Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist palm kung fu?
Hey there, handsome boy.
Stop.
Amazing!
Do you know you have a special aura?
You're so young, but you have the bone structure... and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.
If your chi flow can be channeled, then you will be invincible!
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.

Sure.

This job is a great challenge for us.
Now, that's professionalism.
Number One killers.
Expensive, yes, but worth every penny!
No!
Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer.
He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
strictly speaking, we're just musicians.
A song that wrenches the heart O where do I find a knowing ear?
Great poem, isn't it?
We'II be saying goodbye soon.
Who knows when we'II see each other again.
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a Iot to pack.
You're right.
twelve Kicks of the Tam school!
Superb attack and defense!
Iron Fist: powerful yet delicate.
Topnotch!
Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves.
mystical!
till we meet again!
More Iipstick!
Stay there, or I'II break you in half.
Sorry, we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material!
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories....
insulting the Axe Gang!
We'II show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good!
Don't block my view!
Damn!
I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here.
-really?
-Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'II pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry.
It's nothing!
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry, sorry!
Get out of my way!
Hang in there, tailor.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the Iast we'II see of them.
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down!
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
people are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you I can now die in peace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.
Years ago we saw our only son killed in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters and we'II avenge them!
Becoming a top fighter takes time.
unless you're a naturaI-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.
It's obvious I'm the one!
Don't think so.
Everyone!
We swore we'd never fight again.
But we broke that promise today.
For your own safety, please all leave!
In great power lies great responsibility.
There's no escaping from it.
Donut, you're hurt bad.
Rest now.
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
I know you, four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-chaIIenged.
That's right.
especially goId-framed four-eyes.
gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I Iook good.
So why keep picking on me?
help me!
"help me!
help me!" Want to play, punks?
The Dragon style?
The Tiger style?
Come down here, and I'II smash your glasses.
Come on!
You know I'd do it, right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes all because of you!
You're a numb-nut!
follow me!
It's a stickup!
Where's the money?
Where's the money?
What're you looking at?
I'm serious!
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.
The money's in here.
Let go of the girl!
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
Go away!
You're dragging me down!
Go home and raise pigs.
Go, before I kill you.
You!
Whatsyourname!
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!
-For real?
-Someone's waiting for you.
Brother Sum!
One look at you, and I knew you'd do anything.
Right!
You just needed your chance.
Damn right!
We've an assignment for you.
Anything, Brother Sum!
"Research on abnormal people." What's that?
A mental asylum.
soldiers!
Boy Scouts!
Tanks!
No worries.
When the Boy Scouts change shifts, you have exactly five minutes.
follow the arrows on the map.
Go to the Iast cell and get the man inside there out.
Here's your tools.
What about you guys?
We're your Iookouts.
Five minutes.
Hurry!
The world's top killer indeed looks the part!
It's only a title.
Cut the bullshit.
We want two people killed.
Name your price.
Name my what?
I've killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary.
So far, I've never found one.
That's why I stayed inside.
Had I met my match, I'd have been out long ago.
If you find me a worthy opponent I'II do it for free.
No charge!
Do you have someone?
Yes.
brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge.
But first, will you show us some moves?
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.
You numskuIIs aren't worthy!
He doesn't look the part.
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'II clean up well.
You sure you got the right guy?
absolutely.
I swear I did exactly what you told me.
please show us some moves, Mr. Beast.
Don't make it hard for me!
You dumb or what?
You know what this is, old man?
Ever seen a fist this big?
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!
really?
Try me, then.
Is he okay?
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
Harder!
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun!
In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
The real masters, together in one room!
only the world's top killer has such an aura.
Likewise.
could you two be the fated lovers...?
Paris and helen of Troy!
A pleasure, indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang and only the Axe Gang.
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
With the Beast here, Iet's see whose funeral it is!
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you or be killed by you.
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
Piece of cake.
I can handle this.
Good try, but a little off target.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
-Looks like they're not up to it!
-Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
-I'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
-Go to hell!
You!
Come over here.
-Hit him!
-Yes!
-The head!
-Of course!
-Hit him on the head!
-Okay.
-Here's your chance.
-Got it!
-Hit him!
-Hit him!
-Hit the shit out of him!
-Right!
-Hit him!
-Hit him!
Beat the shit out of him!
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused!
Wow, that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
No one gets away from me!
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at Ieast he finally made good.
Look at him!
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey, wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
There's no one here!
CHINESE MEDICINE
It's a miracle he lasted this long.
The herbs should help him.
herbal medicine can only partly help.
The key is his own body structure.
AII his bones and tendons are broken.
It's amazing he's recovering so fast.
It can't be possible....
unless he's....
What's that smell?
You mustn't smoke while you're hurt.
Let me handle this.
This makes no sense.
Who knew the Beast could clear the chi flow and thus unleash the boy's true potential?
We should've guessed.
He is the one!
Is this for real?
You're still alive, you turncoat?
kill him, men!
What kind of move is that?
Kids' stuff!
If our son were alive, he'd be his age now.
If he studies hard, he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer.
A stuntman, more likely!
Not bad.
Let's go.
I can even stop buIIets--
What?
The Toad style of the Kwan Lun school?
Oh, no!
Remember the palm move that faIIs from heaven?
That's the Iong lost Buddhist palm.
I surrender!
What kind of move was that?
If you want to Iearn, I'II teach you.
Master!
Hey!
tell him not to put snot on the glass.
You two, put your pants on!
No licking if you're not buying!
Kid, you have the bone structure of a kung-fu genius.
world peace is in your hands.
Here's the scroll of the Buddhist palm.
Because it's fate, I'II let you have it for $ 1 0.
Wait!
You want more...?
INSPECTOR CHAN
SUPER CRIME FIGHTERS
Anyone else?
Such a beautiful woman and you arrest her just for spitting?
Is there no justice?
Is there no law?
Commissioner is only your boss because he paid his dues to the Crocodile Gang.
And you don't fucking know me?
Sorry, I didn't know she was your wife.
Ugly coward!
What are you looking at?
Never seen such a handsome gang boss?
Who'd be in the film business?
It's Sunday, and the theater's deserted.
Where's the car?
Let's go back inside!
Call for help!
No need for that, Northerner.
While you were messing with the cop, your men signed up with us.
I'll kill all you Axe Gangsters!
Stop!
You forget the time I treated you to dinner.
Brother Sum.
Please...
Please spare me.
Don't worry.
I don't kill women.
You can go!
Thank you, Big Brother.
Cops!
Come clean up the mess!
THE AXE GANG
In a time of social unrest and disorder the gangs have moved in to consolidate their power.
The most feared of them all is the Axe Gang.
Only in the poorest districts, which hold no interest for the gangs can people live in peace.
PIG STY ALLE Y
One, two, three!
- That okay, Coolie?
- No problem!
TAILOR
NOODLES AND CONGEE
My check, please, Donut.
- How much?
- It's on the house!
Donut.
- It's nothing.
- I like you.
I'll ask the wife about lowering your rent.
Morning, Landlord!
Landlord!
Jill!
How you've grown!
Come let me examine you!
Good to see you, Landlord!
What's so good about it?
Don't...!
Can you make the skirt slit higher?
Sure!
Look, a comet!
Jane!
You naughty girl!
Landlord!
You're such a scoundrel!
Don't go, Jane!
Stay and chat!
I'm only kidding.
Jane!
Landlady!
Landlady!
What happened to the water?
Water ain't free!
You talk a lot for someone who won't pay his rent.
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.
You think that's a problem?
From now on, no water on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
I just love hearing you fools complain.
Assholes!
Good morning, Landlady!
Just pay your rent, or I'll burn your shop down.
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter, fairy!
Serves you right you're a coolie!
Months overdue and not even a "good morning. "
You'll be a coolie for life.
There you go, handsome!
What took you so long with the congee?
I stopped to help an old lady cross the street.
- What are you doing here?
- Checking for Peeping Toms.
Was someone just spying on you, Auntie Six?
Don't shoot your mouth off without proof.
She's crazy.
Go away!
Please can you teach us, sir?
No more soccer!
- Who wants the cut?
- My boss.
Take a seat.
Done!
Fifty cents, please.
Isn't it great?
It's too good!
Why'd you make him look so good?
Why?
Don't get mad, boss.
He's my old buddy.
I'll handle this.
He's boss of the Axe Gang.
Don't you see the two axes?
We're bad guys.
Making him look good is really bad.
Understand?
- I didn't know.
- You're a numskull!
But I like you, so just pay me, and I'll take care of it.
No way!
Steady with the axe, boss.
Let me talk to him.
I really care for you.
You saw it for yourself.
Seriously.
Why don't you pay up.
Not much.
Enough for a drink.
Oh, so it's blackmail!
Boss!
Boss!
Now you're dead!
Looks like he's waking up!
I'm not afraid.
You can kill me.
But there'll be thousands more of me!
You want to play tough?
The Axe Gang boss is napping in there.
Whoever wants to die, step forward.
So you want to fight?
Great!
We'll go one-on-one.
Don't even think about cheating.
That old woman with the onion!
You look real tough.
Want to try me?
I'll let you hit me first.
What do you do?
I'm a farmer.
Farmers don't fight.
Piss off!
He's crazy!
Calling me names?
You're lucky you're a woman.
Hey, shorty!
Yeah, you!
If you're short, you don't retort.
What did I say about cheating?
Sit back down!
You!
The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.
No, not you.
I mean...
You!
Hey, kid, let's rumble!
All right, all right!
So no one-on-ones today.
You're all such wimps!
He blackmailed me.
Fat woman, you're in charge here, right?
Fat woman, my ass!
I'm with the Axe Gang!
Axe Gang, my ass!
Boss!
Boss, my ass!
- You have to pay our medical bills!
- Bills, my ass!
- We're on the same side!
- Same side, my ass!
Think you're so tough?
I'll call for backup!
You nitwit!
Let's see you call backup!
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.
Don't you go away!
Go put a down payment on your coffin!
Who threw the firecracker?
I'm one of you, brother.
Mind your own business!
It's raining.
Go bring in your laundry!
Fat woman!
You blackmailing me too?
I ain't afraid.
I...
Did anyone see what happened?
Don't!
My back's broken!
Call for help!
Hold on, calm down.
You hungry?
Keep quiet.
No.
Who did this?
I'll count to three.
One two...
I did it!
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?
Sorry!
Look away, kid.
Get rid of him!
We're the bad guys!
We're meant to do the ass-kicking not the other way around.
And it's all because these morons posed as Axes.
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.
We'll handle this.
You!
Take care of it.
- Boy, can this guy pick locks.
- It's a living.
Give me a break.
Pick that one too, if you're so good.
Come.
I'll count to three.
Hurry!
Ready?
Three!
That's quick!
Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will!
Go on!
Thank you, Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before, you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living!
The streets out there are filled with money and women.
You only need the will and determination to seize the opportunity to win.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone, and we're in the gang.
Then it'll be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars with no ambition.
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'll smash your glasses!
Get lost!
Come here and say that!
- You're really gonna kill someone?
- That's right!
The four-eyes, the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty.
But they're good at kung fu.
- I can do kung fu!
- Oh, yeah?
Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist Palm kung fu?
Hey there, handsome boy.
Stop.
Amazing!
Do you know you have a special aura?
You're so young, but you have the bone structure... and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.
If your chi flow can be channeled, then you will be invincible!
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.
The duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours.
Sure.
This is the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
It's priceless.
But as it's fate, I'll let you have it for $ 10.
BUDDHIST PALM MANUAL
- You gave him your life savings?
- Yes.
I was saving to study to be a doctor or lawyer but this was world peace.
Let go of the girl!
Hey!
It's the Buddhist Palm!
"The 20-Cent Kung Fu Manual. "
You must be loaded.
Have you killed anyone lately?
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
I realized then that good guys never win.
I want to be bad.
I want to be the killer!
- Ice cream!
- Where?
Make mine a vanilla.
Chocolate for me!
What're you looking at?
Never seen free ice cream before?
Look at her run!
You're such kung-fu masters, go take it on the road.
You belong in the circus, not here!
Don't say that, Landlady.
There must be a reason they're here.
Everyone has his reasons.
We don't want to make trouble.
I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.
We'll never hear the end of it.
Why don't you get lost!
Your wife shouldn't be so nasty.
You okay?
Masters.
We have nothing precious to give you but take this as a token of our appreciation.
Thanks for saving us!
Stop the crying.
This isn't a show!
- You're so cold-hearted.
- Talking back to me, eh?
You may know kung fu, but you're still a fairy.
It's no crime to be good at kung fu!
Once a fairy, always a fairy.
Look at you.
What's with the red underwear?
Why not a diaper while you're at it.
What's wrong with red underwear?
Where were you when there was trouble?
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.
Be reasonable!
I'll reason with you.
You owe me three months' rent.
That's $90.
Pay up or pack up!
Don't you worry.
I'll pay it.
Think you're a smartass, Rabbit-Tooth Jane?
What's it to you, tub of lard?
Bitch!
Calm down, Landlady.
This is your fault.
- Are you trying to kill us?
- You're right.
How could you do that?
Shut the hell up!
You think you can out-yell me?
The fat lady can really sing.
Watch this!
What happened?
What do you mean, what happened?
You try it.
- Me?
- Quick!
Sorry!
You okay?
I think you should get closer and take better aim.
Okay?
Okay!
- Who's throwing the handles?
- Handle?
Where's the third knife?
God knows where it went.
Could it be the same one?
Can't be...
- Don't!
- Sorry.
What are you trying to say?
I just remembered I have something to do.
See you!
Uh-oh.
They've seen us!
Stay back!
Don't panic!
Snakes like music.
If I whistle, they won't bite.
Please, no more bright ideas.
Oh, what the hell!
Not you again, asshole!
Get back to your business!
Split up!
Split?
What're you doing here?
Looking for you.
Weren't you hurt?
I'm fine!
How come you always recover so fast?
I don't know.
- Which hospital did you go to?
- Don't remember.
Maybe it's better that way.
Memories can be painful.
To forget may be a blessing!
I never knew you were so deep.
All the sadness one can bear down the river everywhere.
Hey, get out of the way!
Move!
I'll slap you to kingdom come!
Look at those four-eyes carting around a coffin.
What morons!
Don't blame me for making you leave.
We'll let Buddha decide whether you stay or go.
HORRIFICALLY BAD FATE
Have some tea.
We're grateful for some professional help.
We understand the problem.
Twelve Kicks from the Tam School Iron Fist from the Hung School and the Hexagon Staff...
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.
Their warrior days are long over but they're still top fighters.
This job is a great challenge for us.
Now, that's professionalism.
Number One Killers.
Expensive, yes, but worth every penny!
No!
Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer.
He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
Strictly speaking, we're just musicians.
A song that wrenches the heart O where do I find a knowing ear?
Great poem, isn't it?
We'll be saying goodbye soon.
Who knows when we'll see each other again.
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a lot to pack.
You're right.
Twelve Kicks of the Tam School!
Superb attack and defense!
Iron Fist:
Powerful yet delicate.
Topnotch!
Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves.
Mystical!
Till we meet again!
More lipstick!
Stay there, or I'll break you in half.
Sorry, we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material!
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories...
Insulting the Axe Gang!
We'll show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good!
Don't block my view!
Damn!
I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry.
It's nothing!
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry, sorry!
Get out of my way!
Hang in there, Tailor.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the last we'll see of them.
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down!
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
People are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you I can now die in peace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.
Years ago we saw our only son killed in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters and we'll avenge them!
Becoming a top fighter takes time.
Unless you're a natural-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.
It's obvious I'm the one!
Don't think so.
Everyone!
We swore we'd never fight again.
But we broke that promise today.
For your own safety, please all leave!
In great power lies great responsibility.
There's no escaping from it.
Donut, you're hurt bad.
Rest now.
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
I know you, four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-challenged.
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?
Help me!
"Help me!
Help me!" Want to play, punks?
The Dragon Style?
The Tiger Style?
Come down here, and I'll smash your glasses.
Come on!
You know I'd do it, right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes all because of you!
You're a numb-nut!
Follow me!
It's a stickup!
Where's the money?
Where's the money?
What're you looking at?
I'm serious!
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.
The money's in here.
Let go of the girl!
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
Go away!
You're dragging me down!
Go home and raise pigs.
Go, before I kill you.
You!
Whatsyourname!
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!
- For real?
- Someone's waiting for you.
Brother Sum!
One look at you, and I knew you'd do anything.
Right!
You just needed your chance.
Damn right!
We've an assignment for you.

So far, I've never found one.
That's why I stayed inside.
Had I met my match, I'd have been out long ago.
If you find me a worthy opponent I'll do it for free.
No charge!
Do you have someone?
Yes.
Brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge.
But first, will you show us some moves?
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.
You numskulls aren't worthy!
He doesn't look the part.
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'll clean up well.
You sure you got the right guy?
Absolutely.
I swear I did exactly what you told me.
Please show us some moves, Mr. Beast.
Don't make it hard for me!
You dumb or what?
You know what this is, old man?
Ever seen a fist this big?
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!
Really?
Try me, then.
Is he okay?
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
Harder!
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun!
In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
The real masters, together in one room!
Only the world's top killer has such an aura.
Likewise.
Could you two be the fated lovers...?
Paris and Helen of Troy!
A pleasure, indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang and only the Axe Gang.
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
With the Beast here, let's see whose funeral it is!
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you or be killed by you.
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
Piece of cake.
I can handle this.
Good try, but a little off target.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
- Looks like they're not up to it!
- Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
- I'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
- Go to hell!
You!
Come over here.
- Hit him!
- Yes!
- The head!
- Of course!
- Hit him on the head!
- Okay.
- Here's your chance.
- Got it!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
- Hit the shit out of him!
- Right!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
Beat the shit out of him!
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused!
Wow, that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
No one gets away from me!
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at least he finally made good.
Look at him!
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey, wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
There's no one here!
CHINESE MEDICINE
It's a miracle he lasted this long.
The herbs should help him.
Herbal medicine can only partly help.
The key is his own body structure.
All his bones and tendons are broken.
It's amazing he's recovering so fast.
It can't be possible...
Unless he's...
What's that smell?
You mustn't smoke while you're hurt.
Let me handle this.
This makes no sense.
Who knew the Beast could clear the chi flow and thus unleash the boy's true potential?
We should've guessed.
He is the one!
Is this for real?
You're still alive, you turncoat?
Kill him, men!
What kind of move is that?
Kids' stuff!
If our son were alive, he'd be his age now.
If he studies hard, he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer.
A stuntman, more likely!
Not bad.
Let's go.
I can even stop bullets...
What?
The Toad Style of the Kwan Lun School?
Oh, no!
Remember the Palm move that falls from heaven?
That's the long lost Buddhist Palm.
I surrender!
What kind of move was that?
If you want to learn, I'll teach you.
Master!
Hey!
Tell him not to put snot on the glass.
You two, put your pants on!
No licking if you're not buying!
Kid, you have the bone structure of a kung-fu genius.
World peace is in your hands.
Here's the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
Because it's fate, I'll let you have it for $ 10.
Wait!
You want more...?
INSPECTOR CHAN
SUPER CRIME FIGHTERS
Anyone else?
Such a beautiful woman and you arrest her just for spitting?
Is there no justice?
Is there no law?
Commissioner is only your boss because he paid his dues to the Crocodile Gang.
And you don't fucking know me?
Sorry, I didn't know she was your wife.
Ugly coward!
What are you looking at?
Never seen such a handsome gang boss?
Who'd be in the film business?
It's Sunday, and the theater's deserted.
Where's the car?
Let's go back inside!
Call for help!
No need for that, Northerner.
While you were messing with the cop, your men signed up with us.
I'll kill all you Axe Gangsters!
Stop!
You forget the time I treated you to dinner.
Brother Sum.
Please...
Please spare me.
Don't worry.
I don't kill women.
You can go!
Thank you, Big Brother.
Cops!
Come clean up the mess!
THE AXE GANG
In a time of social unrest and disorder...
In a time of social unrest and disorder the gangs have moved in to consolidate their power.
The most feared of them all is the Axe Gang.
Only in the poorest districts, which hold no interest for the gangs can people live in peace.
PIG STY ALLE Y
One, two, three!
- That okay, Coolie?
- No problem!
TAILOR
NOODLES AND CONGEE
My check, please, Donut.
- How much?
- It's on the house!
Donut.
- It's nothing.
- I like you.
I'll ask the wife about lowering your rent.
Morning, Landlord!
Landlord!
Jill!
How you've grown!
Come let me examine you!
Good to see you, Landlord!
What's so good about it?
Don't...!
Can you make the skirt slit higher?
Sure!
Look, a comet!
Jane!
You naughty girl!
Landlord!
You're such a scoundrel!
Don't go, Jane!
Stay and chat!
I'm only kidding.
Jane!
Landlady!
Landlady!
What happened to the water?
Water ain't free!
You talk a lot for someone who won't pay his rent.
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.
You think that's a problem?
From now on, no water on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
I just love hearing you fools complain.
Assholes!
Good morning, Landlady!
Just pay your rent, or I'll burn your shop down.
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter, fairy!
Serves you right you're a coolie!
Months overdue and not even a "good morning."
You'll be a coolie for life.
There you go, handsome!
What took you so long with the congee?
I stopped to help an old lady cross the street.
- What are you doing here?
- Checking for Peeping Toms.
Was someone just spying on you, Auntie Six?
Don't shoot your mouth off without proof.
She's crazy.
Go away!
Please can you teach us, sir?
No more soccer!
- Who wants the cut?
- My boss.
Take a seat.
Done!
Fifty cents, please.
Isn't it great?
It's too good!
Why'd you make him look so good?
Why?
Don't get mad, boss.
He's my old buddy.
I'll handle this.
He's boss of the Axe Gang.
Don't you see the two axes?
We're bad guys.
Making him look good is really bad.
Understand?
- I didn't know.
- You're a numskull!
But I like you, so just pay me, and I'll take care of it.
No way!
Steady with the axe, boss.
Let me talk to him.
I really care for you.
You saw it for yourself.
Seriously.
Why don't you pay up.
Not much.
Enough for a drink.
Oh, so it's blackmail!
Boss!
Boss!
Now you're dead!
Looks like he's waking up!
I'm not afraid.
You can kill me.
But there'll be thousands more of me!
You want to play tough?
The Axe Gang boss is napping in there.
Whoever wants to die, step forward.
So you want to fight?
Great!
We'll go one-on-one.
Don't even think about cheating.
That old woman with the onion!
You look real tough.
Want to try me?
I'll let you hit me first.
What do you do?
I'm a farmer.
Farmers don't fight.
Piss off!
He's crazy!
Calling me names?
You're lucky you're a woman.
Hey, shorty!
Yeah, you!
If you're short, you don't retort.
What did I say about cheating?
Sit back down!
You!
The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.
No, not you.
I mean...
You!
Hey, kid, let's rumble!
All right, all right!
So no one-on-ones today.
You're all such wimps!
He blackmailed me.
Fat woman, you're in charge here, right?
Fat woman, my ass!
I'm with the Axe Gang!
Axe Gang, my ass!
Boss!
Boss, my ass!
- You have to pay our medical bills!
- Bills, my ass!
- We're on the same side!
- Same side, my ass!
Think you're so tough?
I'll call for backup!
You nitwit!
Let's see you call backup!
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.
Don't you go away!
Go put a down payment on your coffin!
Who threw the firecracker?
I'm one of you, brother.
Mind your own business!
It's raining.
Go bring in your laundry!
Fat woman!
You blackmailing me too?
I ain't afraid.
I...
Did anyone see what happened?
Don't!
My back's broken!
Call for help!
Hold on, calm down.
You hungry?
Keep quiet.
No.
Who did this?
I'll count to three.
One two...
I did it!
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?
Sorry!
Look away, kid.
Get rid of him!
We're the bad guys!
We're meant to do the ass-kicking not the other way around.
And it's all because these morons posed as Axes.
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.
We'll handle this.
You!
Take care of it.
- Boy, can this guy pick locks.
- It's a living.
Give me a break.
Pick that one too, if you're so good.
Come.
I'll count to three.
Hurry!
Ready?
Three!
That's quick!
Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will!
Go on!
Thank you, Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before, you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living!
The streets out there are filled with money and women.
You only need the will and determination to seize the opportunity to win.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone, and we're in the gang.
Then it'll be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars with no ambition.
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'll smash your glasses!
Get lost!
Come here and say that!
- You're really gonna kill someone?
- That's right!
The four-eyes, the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty.
But they're good at kung fu.
- I can do kung fu!
- Oh, yeah?
Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist Palm kung fu?
Hey there, handsome boy.
Stop.
Amazing!
Do you know you have a special aura?
You're so young, but you have the bone structure... and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.
If your chi flow can be channeled, then you will be invincible!
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.
The duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours.
Sure.
This is the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
It's priceless.
But as it's fate, I'll let you have it for $ 10.
BUDDHIST PALM MANUAL
- You gave him your life savings?
- Yes.
I was saving to study to be a doctor or lawyer but this was world peace.
Let go of the girl!
Hey!
It's the Buddhist Palm!
"The 20-Cent Kung Fu Manual."
You must be loaded.
Have you killed anyone lately?
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
I realized then that good guys never win.
I want to be bad.
I want to be the killer!
- Ice cream!
- Where?
Make mine a vanilla.
Chocolate for me!
What're you looking at?
Never seen free ice cream before?
Look at her run!
You're such kung-fu masters, go take it on the road.
You belong in the circus, not here!
Don't say that, Landlady.
There must be a reason they're here.
Everyone has his reasons.
We don't want to make trouble.
I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.
We'll never hear the end of it.
Why don't you get lost!
Your wife shouldn't be so nasty.
You okay?
Masters.
We have nothing precious to give you but take this as a token of our appreciation.
Thanks for saving us!
Stop the crying.
This isn't a show!
- You're so cold-hearted.
- Talking back to me, eh?
You may know kung fu, but you're still a fairy.
It's no crime to be good at kung fu!
Once a fairy, always a fairy.
Look at you.
What's with the red underwear?
Why not a diaper while you're at it.
What's wrong with red underwear?
Where were you when there was trouble?
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.
Be reasonable!
I'll reason with you.
You owe me three months' rent.
That's $90.
Pay up or pack up!
Don't you worry.
I'll pay it.
Think you're a smartass, Rabbit-Tooth Jane?
What's it to you, tub of lard?
Bitch!
Calm down, Landlady.
This is your fault.
- Are you trying to kill us?
- You're right.
How could you do that?
Shut the hell up!
You think you can out-yell me?
The fat lady can really sing.
Watch this!
What happened?
What do you mean, what happened?
You try it.
- Me?
- Quick!
Sorry!
You okay?
I think you should get closer and take better aim.
Okay?
Okay!
- Who's throwing the handles?
- Handle?
Where's the third knife?
God knows where it went.
Could it be the same one?
Can't be...
- Don't!
- Sorry.
What are you trying to say?
I just remembered I have something to do.
See you!
Uh-oh.
They've seen us!
Stay back!
Don't panic!
Snakes like music.
If I whistle, they won't bite.
Please, no more bright ideas.
Oh, what the hell!
Not you again, asshole!
Get back to your business!
Split up!
Split?
What're you doing here?
Looking for you.
Weren't you hurt?
I'm fine!
How come you always recover so fast?
I don't know.
- Which hospital did you go to?
- Don't remember.
Maybe it's better that way.
Memories can be painful.
To forget may be a blessing!
I never knew you were so deep.
All the sadness one can bear down the river everywhere.
Hey, get out of the way!
Move!
I'll slap you to kingdom come!
Look at those four-eyes carting around a coffin.
What morons!
Don't blame me for making you leave.
We'll let Buddha decide whether you stay or go.
HORRIFICALLY BAD FATE
Have some tea.
We're grateful for some professional help.
We understand the problem.
Twelve Kicks from the Tam School Iron Fist from the Hung School and the Hexagon Staff...
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.
Their warrior days are long over but they're still top fighters.
This job is a great challenge for us.
Now, that's professionalism.
Number One Killers.
Expensive, yes, but worth every penny!
No!
Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer.
He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
Strictly speaking, we're just musicians.
A song that wrenches the heart O where do I find a knowing ear?
Great poem, isn't it?
We'll be saying goodbye soon.
Who knows when we'll see each other again.
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a lot to pack.
You're right.
Twelve Kicks of the Tam School!
Superb attack and defense!
Iron Fist:
Powerful yet delicate.
Topnotch!
Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves.
Mystical!
Till we meet again!
More lipstick!
Stay there, or I'll break you in half.
Sorry, we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material!
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories...
Insulting the Axe Gang!
We'll show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good!
Don't block my view!
Damn!
I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry.
It's nothing!
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry, sorry!
Get out of my way!
Hang in there, Tailor.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the last we'll see of them.
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down!
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
People are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you I can now die in peace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.
Years ago we saw our only son killed in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters and we'll avenge them!
Becoming a top fighter takes time.
Unless you're a natural-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.
It's obvious I'm the one!
Don't think so.
Everyone!
We swore we'd never fight again.
But we broke that promise today.
For your own safety, please all leave!
In great power lies great responsibility.
There's no escaping from it.
Donut, you're hurt bad.
Rest now.
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
I know you, four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-challenged.
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?
Help me!
"Help me!
Help me!" Want to play, punks?
The Dragon Style?
The Tiger Style?
Come down here, and I'll smash your glasses.
Come on!
You know I'd do it, right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes all because of you!
You're a numb-nut!
Follow me!
It's a stickup!
Where's the money?
Where's the money?
What're you looking at?
I'm serious!
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.
The money's in here.
Let go of the girl!
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
Go away!
You're dragging me down!
Go home and raise pigs.
Go, before I kill you.
You!
Whatsyourname!
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!
- For real?
- Someone's waiting for you.
Brother Sum!
One look at you, and I knew you'd do anything.
Right!
You just needed your chance.
Damn right!
We've an assignment for you.
Anything, Brother Sum!
"Research on abnormal people." What's that?
A mental asylum.
Soldiers!
Boy Scouts!
Tanks!
No worries.
When the Boy Scouts change shifts, you have exactly five minutes.
Follow the arrows on the map.
Go to the last cell and get the man inside there out.
Here's your tools.
What about you guys?
We're your lookouts.
Five minutes.
Hurry!
The world's top killer indeed looks the part!
It's only a title.
Cut the bullshit.
We want two people killed.
Name your price.
Name my what?
I've killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary.
So far, I've never found one.
That's why I stayed inside.
Had I met my match, I'd have been out long ago.
If you find me a worthy opponent I'll do it for free.
No charge!
Do you have someone?
Yes.
Brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge.
But first, will you show us some moves?
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.
You numskulls aren't worthy!
He doesn't look the part.
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'll clean up well.
You sure you got the right guy?
Absolutely.
I swear I did exactly what you told me.
Please show us some moves, Mr. Beast.
Don't make it hard for me!
You dumb or what?
You know what this is, old man?
Ever seen a fist this big?
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!
Really?
Try me, then.
Is he okay?
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
Harder!
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun!
In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
The real masters, together in one room!
Only the world's top killer has such an aura.
Likewise.
Could you two be the fated lovers...?
Paris and Helen of Troy!
A pleasure, indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang and only the Axe Gang.
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
With the Beast here, let's see whose funeral it is!
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you or be killed by you.
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
Piece of cake.
I can handle this.
Good try, but a little off target.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
- Looks like they're not up to it!
- Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
- I'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
- Go to hell!
You!
Come over here.
- Hit him!
- Yes!
- The head!
- Of course!
- Hit him on the head!
- Okay.
- Here's your chance.
- Got it!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
- Hit the shit out of him!
- Right!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
Beat the shit out of him!
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused!
Wow, that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
No one gets away from me!
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at least he finally made good.
Look at him!
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey, wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
There's no one here!
CHINESE MEDICINE
It's a miracle he lasted this long.

Kids' stuff!

Who'd be in the film business?
It's Sunday, and the theater's deserted.
Where's the car?
Let's go back inside!
Call for help!
No need for that, Northerner.
While you were messing with the cop, your men signed up with us.
I'll kill all you Axe Gangsters!
Stop!
You forget the time I treated you to dinner.

In a time of social unrest and disorder the gangs have moved in to consolidate their power.
The most feared of them all is the Axe Gang.
Only in the poorest districts, which hold no interest for the gangs can people live in peace.

One, two, three!
- That okay, Coolie?
- No problem!

NOODLES AND CONGEE
My check, please, Donut.
- How much?
- It's on the house!
Donut.
- It's nothing.
- I like you.
I'll ask the wife about lowering your rent.
Morning, Landlord!
Landlord!
Jill!
How you've grown!
Come let me examine you!
Good to see you, Landlord!
What's so good about it?
Don't...!
Can you make the skirt slit higher?
Sure!
Look, a comet!
Jane!
You naughty girl!
Landlord!
You're such a scoundrel!
Don't go, Jane!
Stay and chat!
I'm only kidding.
Jane!
Landlady!
Landlady!
What happened to the water?
Water ain't free!
You talk a lot for someone who won't pay his rent.
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.
You think that's a problem?
From now on, no water on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
I just love hearing you fools complain.
Assholes!
Good morning, Landlady!
Just pay your rent, or I'll burn your shop down.
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter, fairy!
Serves you right you're a coolie!
Months overdue and not even a "good morning."
You'll be a coolie for life.
There you go, handsome!
What took you so long with the congee?
I stopped to help an old lady cross the street.
- What are you doing here?
- Checking for Peeping Toms.
Was someone just spying on you, Auntie Six?
Don't shoot your mouth off without proof.
She's crazy.
Go away!
Please can you teach us, sir?
No more soccer!
- Who wants the cut?
- My boss.
Take a seat.
Done!
Fifty cents, please.
Isn't it great?
It's too good!
Why'd you make him look so good?
Why?
Don't get mad, boss.
He's my old buddy.
I'll handle this.
He's boss of the Axe Gang.
Don't you see the two axes?
We're bad guys.
Making him look good is really bad.
Understand?
- I didn't know.
- You're a numskull!
But I like you, so just pay me, and I'll take care of it.
No way!
Steady with the axe, boss.
Let me talk to him.
I really care for you.
You saw it for yourself.
Seriously.
Why don't you pay up.
Not much.
Enough for a drink.
Oh, so it's blackmail!
Boss!
Boss!
Now you're dead!
Looks like he's waking up!
I'm not afraid.
You can kill me.
But there'll be thousands more of me!
You want to play tough?
The Axe Gang boss is napping in there.
Whoever wants to die, step forward.
So you want to fight?
Great!
We'll go one-on-one.
Don't even think about cheating.
That old woman with the onion!
You look real tough.
Want to try me?
I'll let you hit me first.
What do you do?
I'm a farmer.
Farmers don't fight.
Piss off!
He's crazy!
Calling me names?
You're lucky you're a woman.
Hey, shorty!
Yeah, you!
If you're short, you don't retort.
What did I say about cheating?
Sit back down!
You!
The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.
No, not you.
I mean...
You!
Hey, kid, let's rumble!
All right, all right!
So no one-on-ones today.
You're all such wimps!
He blackmailed me.
Fat woman, you're in charge here, right?
Fat woman, my ass!
I'm with the Axe Gang!
Axe Gang, my ass!
Boss!
Boss, my ass!
- You have to pay our medical bills!
- Bills, my ass!
- We're on the same side!
- Same side, my ass!
Think you're so tough?
I'll call for backup!
You nitwit!
Let's see you call backup!
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.
Don't you go away!
Go put a down payment on your coffin!
Who threw the firecracker?
I'm one of you, brother.
Mind your own business!
It's raining.
Go bring in your laundry!
Fat woman!
You blackmailing me too?
I ain't afraid.
I...
Did anyone see what happened?
Don't!
My back's broken!
Call for help!
Hold on, calm down.
You hungry?
Keep quiet.
No.
Who did this?
I'll count to three.
One two...
I did it!
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?
Sorry!
Look away, kid.
Get rid of him!
We're the bad guys!
We're meant to do the ass-kicking not the other way around.
And it's all because these morons posed as Axes.
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.
We'll handle this.
You!
Take care of it.
- Boy, can this guy pick locks.
- It's a living.
Give me a break.
Pick that one too, if you're so good.
Come.
I'll count to three.
Hurry!
Ready?
Three!
That's quick!
Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will!
Go on!
Thank you, Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before, you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living!
The streets out there are filled with money and women.
You only need the will and determination to seize the opportunity to win.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone, and we're in the gang.
Then it'll be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars with no ambition.
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'll smash your glasses!
Get lost!
Come here and say that!
- You're really gonna kill someone?
- That's right!
The four-eyes, the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty.
But they're good at kung fu.
- I can do kung fu!
- Oh, yeah?
Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist Palm kung fu?
Hey there, handsome boy.
Stop.
Amazing!
Do you know you have a special aura?
You're so young, but you have the bone structure... and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.
If your chi flow can be channeled, then you will be invincible!
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.
The duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours.
Sure.
This is the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
It's priceless.
But as it's fate, I'll let you have it for $ 10.
BUDDHIST PALM MANUAL
- You gave him your life savings?
- Yes.
I was saving to study to be a doctor or lawyer but this was world peace.
Let go of the girl!
Hey!
It's the Buddhist Palm!
"The 20-Cent Kung Fu Manual."
You must be loaded.
Have you killed anyone lately?
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
I realized then that good guys never win.
I want to be bad.
I want to be the killer!
- Ice cream!
- Where?
Make mine a vanilla.
Chocolate for me!
What're you looking at?
Never seen free ice cream before?
Look at her run!
You're such kung-fu masters, go take it on the road.
You belong in the circus, not here!
Don't say that, Landlady.
There must be a reason they're here.
Everyone has his reasons.
We don't want to make trouble.
I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.
We'll never hear the end of it.
Why don't you get lost!
Your wife shouldn't be so nasty.
You okay?
Masters.
We have nothing precious to give you but take this as a token of our appreciation.
Thanks for saving us!
Stop the crying.
This isn't a show!
- You're so cold-hearted.
- Talking back to me, eh?
You may know kung fu, but you're still a fairy.
It's no crime to be good at kung fu!
Once a fairy, always a fairy.
Look at you.
What's with the red underwear?
Why not a diaper while you're at it.
What's wrong with red underwear?
Where were you when there was trouble?
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.
Be reasonable!
I'll reason with you.
You owe me three months' rent.
That's $90.
Pay up or pack up!
Don't you worry.
I'll pay it.
Think you're a smartass, Rabbit-Tooth Jane?
What's it to you, tub of lard?
Bitch!
Calm down, Landlady.
This is your fault.
- Are you trying to kill us?
- You're right.
How could you do that?
Shut the hell up!
You think you can out-yell me?
The fat lady can really sing.
Watch this!
What happened?
What do you mean, what happened?
You try it.
- Me?
- Quick!
Sorry!
You okay?
I think you should get closer and take better aim.
Okay?
Okay!
- Who's throwing the handles?
- Handle?
Where's the third knife?
God knows where it went.
Could it be the same one?
Can't be...
- Don't!
- Sorry.
What are you trying to say?
I just remembered I have something to do.
See you!
Uh-oh.
They've seen us!
Stay back!
Don't panic!
Snakes like music.
If I whistle, they won't bite.
Please, no more bright ideas.
Oh, what the hell!
Not you again, asshole!
Get back to your business!
Split up!
Split?
What're you doing here?
Looking for you.
Weren't you hurt?
I'm fine!
How come you always recover so fast?
I don't know.
- Which hospital did you go to?
- Don't remember.
Maybe it's better that way.
Memories can be painful.
To forget may be a blessing!
I never knew you were so deep.
All the sadness one can bear down the river everywhere.
Hey, get out of the way!
Move!
I'll slap you to kingdom come!
Look at those four-eyes carting around a coffin.
What morons!
Don't blame me for making you leave.
We'll let Buddha decide whether you stay or go.
HORRIFICALLY BAD FATE
Have some tea.
We're grateful for some professional help.
We understand the problem.
Twelve Kicks from the Tam School Iron Fist from the Hung School and the Hexagon Staff...
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.
Their warrior days are long over but they're still top fighters.
This job is a great challenge for us.
Now, that's professionalism.
Number One Killers.
Expensive, yes, but worth every penny!
No!
Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer.
He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
Strictly speaking, we're just musicians.
A song that wrenches the heart O where do I find a knowing ear?
Great poem, isn't it?
We'll be saying goodbye soon.
Who knows when we'll see each other again.
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a lot to pack.
You're right.
Twelve Kicks of the Tam School!
Superb attack and defense!
Iron Fist: powerful yet delicate.
Topnotch!
Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves.
Mystical!
Till we meet again!
More lipstick!
Stay there, or I'll break you in half.
Sorry, we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material!
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories...
Insulting the Axe Gang!
We'll show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good!
Don't block my view!
Damn!
I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry.
It's nothing!
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry, sorry!
Get out of my way!
Hang in there, Tailor.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the last we'll see of them.
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down!
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
People are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you I can now die in peace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.
Years ago we saw our only son killed in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters and we'll avenge them!
Becoming a top fighter takes time.
Unless you're a natural-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.
It's obvious I'm the one!
Don't think so.
Everyone!
We swore we'd never fight again.
But we broke that promise today.
For your own safety, please all leave!
In great power lies great responsibility.
There's no escaping from it.
Donut, you're hurt bad.
Rest now.
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
I know you, four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-challenged.
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?
Help me!
"Help me!
Help me!" Want to play, punks?
The Dragon Style?
The Tiger Style?
Come down here, and I'll smash your glasses.
Come on!
You know I'd do it, right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes all because of you!
You're a numb-nut!
Follow me!
It's a stickup!
Where's the money?
Where's the money?
What're you looking at?
I'm serious!
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.
The money's in here.
Let go of the girl!
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
Go away!
You're dragging me down!
Go home and raise pigs.
Go, before I kill you.
You!
Whatsyourname!
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!
- For real?
- Someone's waiting for you.
Brother Sum!
One look at you, and I knew you'd do anything.
Right!
You just needed your chance.
Damn right!
We've an assignment for you.
Anything, Brother Sum!
"Research on abnormal people." What's that?
A mental asylum.
Soldiers!
Boy Scouts!
Tanks!
No worries.
When the Boy Scouts change shifts, you have exactly five minutes.
Follow the arrows on the map.
Go to the last cell and get the man inside there out.
Here's your tools.
What about you guys?
We're your lookouts.
Five minutes.
Hurry!
The world's top killer indeed looks the part!
It's only a title.
Cut the bullshit.
We want two people killed.
Name your price.
Name my what?
I've killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary.
So far, I've never found one.
That's why I stayed inside.
Had I met my match, I'd have been out long ago.
If you find me a worthy opponent I'll do it for free.
No charge!
Do you have someone?
Yes.
Brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge.
But first, will you show us some moves?
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.
You numskulls aren't worthy!
He doesn't look the part.
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'll clean up well.
You sure you got the right guy?
Absolutely.
I swear I did exactly what you told me.
Please show us some moves, Mr. Beast.
Don't make it hard for me!
You dumb or what?
You know what this is, old man?
Ever seen a fist this big?
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!
Really?
Try me, then.
Is he okay?
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
Harder!
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun!
In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
The real masters, together in one room!
Only the world's top killer has such an aura.
Likewise.
Could you two be the fated lovers...?
Paris and Helen of Troy!
A pleasure, indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang and only the Axe Gang.
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
With the Beast here, let's see whose funeral it is!
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you or be killed by you.
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
Piece of cake.
I can handle this.
Good try, but a little off target.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
- Looks like they're not up to it!
- Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
- I'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
- Go to hell!
You!
Come over here.
- Hit him!
- Yes!
- The head!
- Of course!
- Hit him on the head!
- Okay.
- Here's your chance.
- Got it!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
- Hit the shit out of him!
- Right!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
Beat the shit out of him!
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused!
Wow, that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
No one gets away from me!
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at least he finally made good.
Look at him!
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey, wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
There's no one here!
CHINESE MEDICINE
It's a miracle he lasted this long.
The herbs should help him.
Herbal medicine can only partly help.
The key is his own body structure.
All his bones and tendons are broken.
It's amazing he's recovering so fast.
It can't be possible...
Unless he's...
What's that smell?
You mustn't smoke while you're hurt.
Let me handle this.
This makes no sense.
Who knew the Beast could clear the chi flow and thus unleash the boy's true potential?
We should've guessed.
He is the one!
Is this for real?
You're still alive, you turncoat?
Kill him, men!
What kind of move is that?
Kids' stuff!
If our son were alive, he'd be his age now.
If he studies hard, he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer.
A stuntman, more likely!
Not bad.
Let's go.
I can even stop bullets...
What?
The Toad Style of the Kwan Lun School?
Oh, no!
Remember the Palm move that falls from heaven?
That's the long lost Buddhist Palm.
I surrender!
What kind of move was that?
If you want to learn, I'll teach you.
Master!
Hey!
Tell him not to put snot on the glass.
You two, put your pants on!
No licking if you're not buying!
Kid, you have the bone structure of a kung-fu genius.
World peace is in your hands.
Here's the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
Because it's fate, I'll let you have it for $ 10.
Wait!
You want more...?
INSPECTOR CHAN
SUPER CRIME FIGHTERS
Anyone else?
Such a beautiful woman and you arrest her just for spitting?
Is there no justice?
Is there no law?
Commissioner is only your boss because he paid his dues to the Crocodile Gang.
And you don't fucking know me?
Sorry, I didn't know she was your wife.
Ugly coward!
What are you looking at?
Never seen such a handsome gang boss?
Who'd be in the film business?
It's Sunday, and the theatre's deserted.
Where's the car?
Let's go back inside!
Call for help!
No need for that, Northerner.
While you were messing with the cop, your men signed up with us.
I'll kill all you Axe Gangsters!
Stop!
You forget the time I treated you to dinner.
Brother Sum.
Please...
Please spare me.
Don't worry.
I don't kill women.
You can go!
Thank you, Big Brother.
Cops!
Come clean up the mess!
THE AXE GANG

In a time of social unrest and disorder the gangs have moved in to consolidate their power.
The most feared of them all is the Axe Gang.
Only in the poorest districts, which hold no interest for the gangs can people live in peace.

My check, please, Donut.
- How much?
- It's on the house!
Donut.
- It's nothing.
- I like you.
I'll ask the wife about lowering your rent.
Morning, Landlord!
Landlord!
Jill!
How you've grown!
Come let me examine you!
Good to see you, Landlord!
What's so good about it?
Don't...!
Can you make the skirt slit higher?
Sure!
Look, a comet!
Jane!
You naughty girl!
Landlord!
You're such a scoundrel!
Don't go, Jane!
Stay and chat!
I'm only kidding.
Jane!
Landlady!
Landlady!
What happened to the water?
Water ain't free!
You talk a lot for someone who won't pay his rent.
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.
You think that's a problem?
From now on, no water on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
I just love hearing you fools complain.
Assholes!
Good morning, Landlady!
Just pay your rent, or I'll burn your shop down.
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter, fairy!
Serves you right you're a coolie!
Months overdue and not even a "good morning."
You'll be a coolie for life.
There you go, handsome!
What took you so long with the congee?
I stopped to help an old lady cross the street.
- What are you doing here?
- Checking for Peeping Toms.
Was someone just spying on you, Auntie Six?
Don't shoot your mouth off without proof.
She's crazy.
Go away!
Please can you teach us, sir?
No more soccer!
- Who wants the cut?
- My boss.
Take a seat.
Done!
Fifty cents, please.
Isn't it great?
It's too good!
Why'd you make him look so good?
Why?
Don't get mad, boss.
He's my old buddy.
I'll handle this.
He's boss of the Axe Gang.
Don't you see the two axes?
We're bad guys.
Making him look good is really bad.
Understand?
- I didn't know.
- You're a numskull!
But I like you, so just pay me, and I'll take care of it.
No way!
Steady with the axe, boss.
Let me talk to him.
I really care for you.
You saw it for yourself.
Seriously.
Why don't you pay up.
Not much.
Enough for a drink.
Oh, so it's blackmail!
Boss!
Boss!
Now you're dead!
Looks like he's waking up!
I'm not afraid.
You can kill me.
But there'll be thousands more of me!
You want to play tough?
The Axe Gang boss is napping in there.
Whoever wants to die, step forward.
So you want to fight?
Great!
We'll go one-on-one.
Don't even think about cheating.
That old woman with the onion!
You look real tough.
Want to try me?
I'll let you hit me first.
What do you do?
I'm a farmer.
Farmers don't fight.
Piss off!
He's crazy!
Calling me names?
You're lucky you're a woman.
Hey, shorty!
Yeah, you!
If you're short, you don't retort.
What did I say about cheating?
Sit back down!
You!
The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.
No, not you.
I mean...
You!
Hey, kid, let's rumble!
All right, all right!
So no one-on-ones today.
You're all such wimps!
He blackmailed me.
Fat woman, you're in charge here, right?
Fat woman, my ass!
I'm with the Axe Gang!
Axe Gang, my ass!
Boss!
Boss, my ass!
- You have to pay our medical bills!
- Bills, my ass!
- We're on the same side!
- Same side, my ass!
Think you're so tough?
I'll call for backup!
You nitwit!
Let's see you call backup!
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.
Don't you go away!
Go put a down payment on your coffin!
Who threw the firecracker?
I'm one of you, brother.
Mind your own business!
It's raining.
Go bring in your laundry!
Fat woman!
You blackmailing me too?
I ain't afraid.
I...
Did anyone see what happened?
Don't!
My back's broken!
Call for help!
Hold on, calm down.
You hungry?
Keep quiet.
No.
Who did this?
I'll count to three.
One two...
I did it!
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?
Sorry!
Look away, kid.
Get rid of him!
We're the bad guys!
We're meant to do the ass-kicking not the other way around.
And it's all because these morons posed as Axes.
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.
We'll handle this.
You!
Take care of it.
- Boy, can this guy pick locks.
- It's a living.
Give me a break.
Pick that one too, if you're so good.
Come.
I'll count to three.
Hurry!
Ready?
Three!
That's quick!
Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will!
Go on!
Thank you, Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before, you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living!
The streets out there are filled with money and women.
You only need the will and determination to seize the opportunity to win.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone, and we're in the gang.
Then it'll be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars with no ambition.
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'll smash your glasses!
Get lost!
Come here and say that!
- You're really gonna kill someone?
- That's right!
The four-eyes, the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty.
But they're good at kung fu.
- I can do kung fu!
- Oh, yeah?
Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist Palm kung fu?
Hey there, handsome boy.
Stop.
Amazing!
Do you know you have a special aura?
You're so young, but you have the bone structure... and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.
If your chi flow can be channelled, then you will be invincible!
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.
The duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours.
Sure.
This is the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
It's priceless.
But as it's fate, I'll let you have it for $10.
BUDDHIST PALM MANU AL
- You gave him your life savings?
- Yes.
I was saving to study to be a doctor or lawyer but this was world peace.
Let go of the girl!
Hey!
It's the Buddhist Palm!
"The 20-Cent Kung Fu Manual."
You must be loaded.
Have you killed anyone lately?
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
I realized then that good guys never win.
I want to be bad.
I want to be the killer!
- Ice cream!
- Where?
Make mine a vanilla.
Chocolate for me!
What're you looking at?
Never seen free ice cream before?
Look at her run!
You're such kung-fu masters, go take it on the road.
You belong in the circus, not here!
Don't say that, Landlady.
There must be a reason they're here.
Everyone has his reasons.
We don't want to make trouble.
I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.
We'll never hear the end of it.
Why don't you get lost!
Your wife shouldn't be so nasty.
You okay?
Masters.
We have nothing precious to give you but take this as a token of our appreciation.
Thanks for saving us!
Stop the crying.
This isn't a show!
- You're so cold-hearted.
- Talking back to me, eh?
You may know kung fu, but you're still a fairy.
It's no crime to be good at kung fu!
Once a fairy, always a fairy.
Look at you.
What's with the red underwear?
Why not a diaper while you're at it.
What's wrong with red underwear?
Where were you when there was trouble?
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.
Be reasonable!
I'll reason with you.
You owe me three months' rent.
That's $90.
Pay up or pack up!
Don't you worry.
I'll pay it.
Think you're a smartass, Rabbit-Tooth Jane?
What's it to you, tub of lard?
Bitch!
Calm down, Landlady.
This is your fault.
- Are you trying to kill us?
- You're right.
How could you do that?
Shut the hell up!
You think you can out-yell me?
The fat lady can really sing.
Watch this!
What happened?
What do you mean, what happened?
You try it.
- Me?
- Quick!
Sorry!
You okay?
I think you should get closer and take better aim.
Okay?
Okay!
- Who's throwing the handles?
- Handle?
Where's the third knife?
God knows where it went.
Could it be the same one?
Can't be...
- Don't!
- Sorry.
What are you trying to say?
I just remembered I have something to do.
See you!
Uh-oh.
They've seen us!
Stay back!
Don't panic!
Snakes like music.
If I whistle, they won't bite.
Please, no more bright ideas.
Oh, what the hell!
Not you again, asshole!
Get back to your business!
Split up!
Split?
What're you doing here?
Looking for you.
Weren't you hurt?
I'm fine!
How come you always recover so fast?
I don't know.
- Which hospital did you go to?
- Don't remember.
Maybe it's better that way.
Memories can be painful.
To forget may be a blessing!
I never knew you were so deep.
All the sadness one can bear down the river everywhere.
Hey, get out of the way!
Move!
I'll slap you to kingdom come!
Look at those four-eyes carting around a coffin.
What morons!
Don't blame me for making you leave.
We'll let Buddha decide whether you stay or go.
HORRIFICALLY BAD FATE
Have some tea.
We're grateful for some professional help.
We understand the problem.
Twelve Kicks from the Tam School Iron Fist from the Hung School and the Hexagon Staff...
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.
Their warrior days are long over but they're still top fighters.
This job is a great challenge for us.
Now, that's professionalism.
Number One Killers.
Expensive, yes, but worth every penny!
No!
Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer.
He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
Strictly speaking, we're just musicians.
A song that wrenches the heart O where do I find a knowing ear?
Great poem, isn't it?
We'll be saying goodbye soon.
Who knows when we'll see each other again.
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a lot to pack.
You're right.
Twelve Kicks of the Tam School!
Superb attack and defence!
Iron Fist: powerful yet delicate.
Top-notch!
Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves.
Mystical!
Till we meet again!
More lipstick!
Stay there, or I'll break you in half.
Sorry, we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material!
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories...
Insulting the Axe Gang!
We'll show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good!
Don't block my view!
Damn!
I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry.
It's nothing!
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry, sorry!
Get out of my way!
Hang in there, Tailor.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the last we'll see of them.
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down!
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
People are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you I can now die in peace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.
Years ago we saw our only son killed in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters and we'll avenge them!
Becoming a top fighter takes time.
Unless you're a natural-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.
It's obvious I'm the one!
Don't think so.
Everyone!
We swore we'd never fight again.
But we broke that promise today.
For your own safety, please all leave!
In great power lies great responsibility.
There's no escaping from it.
Donut, you're hurt bad.
Rest now.
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
I know you, four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-challenged.
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?
Help me!
"Help me!
Help me!" Want to play, punks?
The Dragon Style?
The Tiger Style?
Come down here, and I'll smash your glasses.
Come on!
You know I'd do it, right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes all because of you!
You're a numb-nut!
Follow me!
It's a stickup!
Where's the money?
Where's the money?
What're you looking at?
I'm serious!
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.
The money's in here.
Let go of the girl!
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
Go away!
You're dragging me down!
Go home and raise pigs.
Go, before I kill you.
You!
Whatsyourname!
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!
- For real?
- Someone's waiting for you.
Brother Sum!
One look at you, and I knew you'd do anything.
Right!
You just needed your chance.
Damn right!
We've an assignment for you.
Anything, Brother Sum!
"Research on abnormal people." What's that?
A mental asylum.
Soldiers!
Boy Scouts!
Tanks!
No worries.
When the Boy Scouts change shifts, you have exactly five minutes.
Follow the arrows on the map.
Go to the last cell and get the man inside there out.
Here's your tools.
What about you guys?
We're your lookouts.
Five minutes.
Hurry!
The world's top killer indeed looks the part!
It's only a title.
Cut the bullshit.
We want two people killed.
Name your price.
Name my what?
I've killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary.
So far, I've never found one.
That's why I stayed inside.
Had I met my match, I'd have been out long ago.
If you find me a worthy opponent I'll do it for free.
No charge!
Do you have someone?
Yes.
Brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge.
But first, will you show us some moves?
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.
You numskulls aren't worthy!
He doesn't look the part.
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'll clean up well.
You sure you got the right guy?
Absolutely.
I swear I did exactly what you told me.
Please show us some moves, Mr. Beast.
Don't make it hard for me!
You dumb or what?
You know what this is, old man?
Ever seen a fist this big?
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!
Really?
Try me, then.
Is he okay?
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
Harder!
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun!
In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
The real masters, together in one room!
Only the world's top killer has such an aura.
Likewise.
Could you two be the fated lovers...?
Paris and Helen of Troy!
A pleasure, indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang and only the Axe Gang.
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
With the Beast here, let's see whose funeral it is!
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you or be killed by you.
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
Piece of cake.
I can handle this.
Good try, but a little off target.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
- Looks like they're not up to it!
- Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
- I'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
- Go to hell!
You!
Come over here.
- Hit him!
- Yes!
- The head!
- Of course!
- Hit him on the head!
- Okay.
- Here's your chance.
- Got it!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
- Hit the shit out of him!
- Right!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
Beat the shit out of him!
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused!
Wow, that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
No one gets away from me!
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at least he finally made good.
Look at him!
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey, wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
There's no one here!
CHINESE MEDICINE
It's a miracle he lasted this long.
The herbs should help him.
Herbal medicine can only partly help.
The key is his own body structure.
All his bones and tendons are broken.
It's amazing he's recovering so fast.
It can't be possible...
Unless he's...
What's that smell?
You mustn't smoke while you're hurt.
Let me handle this.
This makes no sense.
Who knew the Beast could clear the chi flow and thus unleash the boy's true potential?
We should've guessed.
He is the one!
Is this for real?
You're still alive, you turncoat?
Kill him, men!
What kind of move is that?
Kids' stuff!
If our son were alive, he'd be his age now.
If he studies hard, he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer.
A stuntman, more likely!
Not bad.
Let's go.
I can even stop bullets...
What?
The Toad Style of the Kwan Lun School?
Oh, no!
Remember the Palm move that falls from heaven?
That's the long lost Buddhist Palm.
I surrender!
What kind of move was that?
If you want to learn, I'll teach you.
Master!
Hey!
Tell him not to put snot on the glass.
You two, put your pants on!
No licking if you're not buying!
Kid, you have the bone structure of a kung-fu genius.
World peace is in your hands.
Here's the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
Because it's fate, I'll let you have it for $10.
Wait!
You want more...?
INSPECTOR CHAN
SUPER CRIME FIGHTERS
Anyone else?
Such a beautiful woman and you arrest her just for spitting?
Is there no justice?
Is there no law?
Commissioner is only your boss because he paid his dues to the Crocodile Gang.
And you don't fucking know me?
Sorry I didn't know she was your wife.
Ugly coward!
What are you looking at?
Never seen such a handsome gang boss?
Who'd be in the film business?
It's Sunday and the theater's deserted.
Where's the car?
Let's go back inside!
Call for help!
No need for that Northerner.
While you were messing with the cop your men signed up with us.
I'll kill all you Axe Gangsters!
Stop!
You forget the time I treated you to dinner.
Brother Sum.
Please...
Please spare me.
Don't worry.
I don't kill women.
You can go!
Thank you Big Brother.
Cops!
Come clean up the mess!
THE AXE GANG
In a time of social unrest and disorder...
In a time of social unrest and disorder the gangs have moved in to consolidate their power.
The most feared of them all is the Axe Gang.
Only in the poorest districts which hold no interest for the gangs can people live in peace.
PIG STY ALLE Y
One two three!
- That okay Coolie?
- No problem!
TAILOR
NOODLES AND CONGEE
My check please Donut.
- How much?
- It's on the house!
Donut.
- It's nothing.
- I like you.
I'll ask the wife about lowering your rent.
Morning Landlord!
Landlord!
Jill!
How you've grown!
Come let me examine you!
Good to see you Landlord!
What's so good about it?
Don't...!
Can you make the skirt slit higher?
Sure!
Look a comet!
Jane!
You naughty girl!
Landlord!
You're such a scoundrel!
Don't go Jane!
Stay and chat!
I'm only kidding.
Jane!
Landlady!
Landlady!
What happened to the water?
Water ain't free!
You talk a lot for someone who won't pay his rent.
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.
You think that's a problem?
From now on no water on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays.
Water ration Tuesdays Thursdays and Saturdays.
I just love hearing you fools complain.
Assholes!
Good morning Landlady!
Just pay your rent or I'll burn your shop down.
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter fairy!
Serves you right you're a coolie!
Months overdue and not even a "good morning."
You'll be a coolie for life.
There you go handsome!
What took you so long with the congee?
I stopped to help an old lady cross the street.
- What are you doing here?
- Checking for Peeping Toms.
Was someone just spying on you Auntie Six?
Don't shoot your mouth off without proof.
She's crazy.
Go away!
Please can you teach us sir?
No more soccer!
- Who wants the cut?
- My boss.
Take a seat.
Done!
Fifty cents please.
Isn't it great?
It's too good!
Why'd you make him look so good?
Why?
Don't get mad boss.
He's my old buddy.
I'll handle this.
He's boss of the Axe Gang.
Don't you see the two axes?
We're bad guys.
Making him look good is really bad.
Understand?
- I didn't know.
- You're a numskull!
But I like you so just pay me and I'll take care of it.
No way!
Steady with the axe boss.
Let me talk to him.
I really care for you.
You saw it for yourself.
Seriously.
Why don't you pay up.
Not much.
Enough for a drink.
Oh so it's blackmail!
Boss!
Boss!
Now you're dead!
Looks like he's waking up!
I'm not afraid.
You can kill me.
But there'll be thousands more of me!
You want to play tough?
The Axe Gang boss is napping in there.
Whoever wants to die step forward.
So you want to fight?
Great!
We'll go one-on-one.
Don't even think about cheating.
That old woman with the onion!
You look real tough.
Want to try me?
I'll let you hit me first.
What do you do?
I'm a farmer.
Farmers don't fight.
Piss off!
He's crazy!
Calling me names?
You're lucky you're a woman.
Hey shorty!
Yeah you!
If you're short you don't retort.
What did I say about cheating?
Sit back down!
You!
The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.
No not you.
I mean...
You!
Hey kid let's rumble!
All right all right!
So no one-on-ones today.
You're all such wimps!
He blackmailed me.
Fat woman you're in charge here right?
Fat woman my ass!
I'm with the Axe Gang!
Axe Gang my ass!
Boss!
Boss my ass!
- You have to pay our medical bills!
- Bills my ass!
- We're on the same side!
- Same side my ass!
Think you're so tough?
I'll call for backup!
You nitwit!
Let's see you call backup!
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.
Don't you go away!
Go put a down payment on your coffin!
Who threw the firecracker?
I'm one of you brother.
Mind your own business!
It's raining.
Go bring in your laundry!
Fat woman!
You blackmailing me too?
I ain't afraid.
I...
Did anyone see what happened?
Don't!
My back's broken!
Call for help!
Hold on calm down.
You hungry?
Keep quiet.
No.
Who did this?
I'll count to three.
One two...
I did it!
Are the goods okay Brother Sum?
Sorry!
Look away kid.
Get rid of him!
We're the bad guys!
We're meant to do the ass-kicking not the other way around.
And it's all because these morons posed as Axes.
Don't waste your time Brother Sum.
We'll handle this.
You!
Take care of it.
- Boy can this guy pick locks.
- It's a living.
Give me a break.
Pick that one too if you're so good.
Come.
I'll count to three.
Hurry!
Ready?
Three!
That's quick!
Brother Sum we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will!
Go on!
Thank you Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living!
The streets out there are filled with money and women.
You only need the will and determination to seize the opportunity to win.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone and we're in the gang.
Then it'll be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars with no ambition.
Who are you looking at four-eyes?
I'll smash your glasses!
Get lost!
Come here and say that!
- You're really gonna kill someone?
- That's right!
The four-eyes the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty.
But they're good at kung fu.
- I can do kung fu!
- Oh yeah?
Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist Palm kung fu?
Hey there handsome boy.
Stop.
Amazing!
Do you know you have a special aura?
You're so young but you have the bone structure... and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.

Who knows when we'll see each other again.
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a lot to pack.
You're right.
Twelve Kicks of the Tam School!
Superb attack and defense!
Iron Fist:
Powerful yet delicate.
Topnotch!
Hexagon Staff with its thousand moves.
Mystical!
Till we meet again!
More lipstick!
Stay there or I'll break you in half.
Sorry we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material!
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories...
Insulting the Axe Gang!
We'll show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good!
Don't block my view!
Damn!
I told those nitwits to leave but they're still here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?
Sorry sorry.
It's nothing!
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey fatso eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry sorry!
Get out of my way!
Hang in there Tailor.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the last we'll see of them.
It's bad Brother Sum.
Quick start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down!
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
People are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you I can now die in peace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said everyone has his reasons.
Years ago we saw our only son killed in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters and we'll avenge them!
Becoming a top fighter takes time.
Unless you're a natural-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.
It's obvious I'm the one!
Don't think so.
Everyone!
We swore we'd never fight again.
But we broke that promise today.
For your own safety please all leave!
In great power lies great responsibility.
There's no escaping from it.
Donut you're hurt bad.
Rest now.
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
I know you four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-challenged.
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?
Help me!
"Help me!
Help me!" Want to play punks?
The Dragon Style?
The Tiger Style?
Come down here and I'll smash your glasses.
Come on!
You know I'd do it right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing no arson no robberies no rapes all because of you!
You're a numb-nut!
Follow me!
It's a stickup!
Where's the money?
Where's the money?
What're you looking at?
I'm serious!
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.
The money's in here.
Let go of the girl!
He's a fool and she's mute.
Losers!
Go away!
You're dragging me down!
Go home and raise pigs.
Go before I kill you.
You!
Whatsyourname!
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!
- For real?
- Someone's waiting for you.
Brother Sum!
One look at you and I knew you'd do anything.
Right!
You just needed your chance.
Damn right!
We've an assignment for you.
Anything Brother Sum!
"Research on abnormal people." What's that?
A mental asylum.
Soldiers!
Boy Scouts!
Tanks!
No worries.
When the Boy Scouts change shifts you have exactly five minutes.
Follow the arrows on the map.
Go to the last cell and get the man inside there out.
Here's your tools.
What about you guys?
We're your lookouts.
Five minutes.
Hurry!
The world's top killer indeed looks the part!
It's only a title.
Cut the bullshit.
We want two people killed.
Name your price.
Name my what?
I've killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary.
So far I've never found one.
That's why I stayed inside.
Had I met my match I'd have been out long ago.
If you find me a worthy opponent I'll do it for free.
No charge!
Do you have someone?
Yes.
Brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge.
But first will you show us some moves?
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.
You numskulls aren't worthy!
He doesn't look the part.
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'll clean up well.
You sure you got the right guy?
Absolutely.
I swear I did exactly what you told me.
Please show us some moves Mr. Beast.
Don't make it hard for me!
You dumb or what?
You know what this is old man?
Ever seen a fist this big?
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!
Really?
Try me then.
Is he okay?
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
Harder!
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun!
In the world of kung fu speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
The real masters together in one room!
Only the world's top killer has such an aura.
Likewise.
Could you two be the fated lovers...?
Paris and Helen of Troy!
A pleasure indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang and only the Axe Gang.
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
With the Beast here let's see whose funeral it is!
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you or be killed by you.
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
Piece of cake.
I can handle this.
Good try but a little off target.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
- Looks like they're not up to it!
- Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
- I'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
- Go to hell!
You!
Come over here.
- Hit him!
- Yes!
- The head!
- Of course!
- Hit him on the head!
- Okay.
- Here's your chance.
- Got it!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
- Hit the shit out of him!
- Right!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
Beat the shit out of him!
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused!
Wow that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
No one gets away from me!
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at least he finally made good.
Look at him!
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
There's no one here!
CHINESE MEDICINE
It's a miracle he lasted this long.
The herbs should help him.
Herbal medicine can only partly help.
The key is his own body structure.
All his bones and tendons are broken.
It's amazing he's recovering so fast.
It can't be possible...
Unless he's...
What's that smell?
You mustn't smoke while you're hurt.
Let me handle this.
This makes no sense.
Who knew the Beast could clear the chi flow and thus unleash the boy's true potential?
We should've guessed.
He is the one!
Is this for real?
You're still alive you turncoat?
Kill him men!
What kind of move is that?
Kids' stuff!
If our son were alive he'd be his age now.
If he studies hard he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer.
A stuntman more likely!
Not bad.
Let's go.
I can even stop bullets...
What?
The Toad Style of the Kwan Lun School?
Oh no!
Remember the Palm move that falls from heaven?
That's the long lost Buddhist Palm.
I surrender!
What kind of move was that?
If you want to learn I'll teach you.
Master!
Hey!
Tell him not to put snot on the glass.
You two put your pants on!
No licking if you're not buying!
Kid you have the bone structure of a kung-fu genius.
World peace is in your hands.
Here's the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
Because it's fate I'll let you have it for $ 10.
Wait!
You want more...?

Sorry, I didn't know she was your wife.
Ugly coward !
What are you looking at?
Never seen such a handsome gang boss?
Who'd be in the film business?
It's Sunday, and the theater's deserted.
Where's the car?
Let's go back inside!
Call for help!
No need for that, Northerner.
While you were messing with the cop, your men signed up with us.
I'll kill all you Axe Gangsters!
Stop!
You forget the time I treated you to dinner.
Brother Sum.
Please... .
Please spare me.
Don't worry.
I don't kill women.
You can go!
Thank you, Big Brother.

Come clean up the mess!

My check, please, Donut.
-How much?
-lt's on the house!
Donut.
-lt's nothing.
-l like you.
I'll ask the wife about lowering your rent.
Morning, Landlord !
Landlord !
Jill !
How you've grown !
Come let me examine you !
Good to see you, Landlord !
What's so good about it?
Don't... !
Can you make the skirt slit higher?
Sure!
Look, a comet!
Jane!
You naughty girl !
Landlord !
You're such a scoundrel !
Don't go, Jane!
Stay and chat!
I'm only kidding.
Jane!
Landlady!
What happened to the water?
Water ain't free!
You talk a lot for someone who won't pay his rent.
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.
You think that's a problem?
From now on, no water on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
I just love hearing you fools complain.
Assholes!
Good morning, Landlady!
Just pay your rent, or I'll burn your shop down.
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter, fairy!
Serves you right you're a coolie!
Months overdue and not even a "good morning."
You'll be a coolie for life.
There you go, handsome!
What took you so long with the congee?
I stopped to help an old lady cross the street.
-What are you doing here?
-Checking for Peeping Toms.
Was someone just spying on you, Auntie Six?
Don't shoot your mouth off without proof.
She's crazy.
Go away!
Please can you teach us, sir?
No more soccer!
-Who wants the cut?
-My boss.
Take a seat.
Done!
Fifty cents, please.
Isn't it great?
It's too good !
Why'd you make him look so good?
Why?
Don't get mad, boss.
He's my old buddy. I'll handle this.
He's boss of the Axe Gang.
Don't you see the two axes?
We're bad guys.
Making him look good is really bad.
Understand?
-l didn't know.
-You're a numskull !
But I like you, so just pay me, and I'll take care of it.
No way!
Steady with the axe, boss.
Let me talk to him.
I really care for you.
You saw it for yourself.
Seriously.
Why don't you pay up.
Not much.
Enough for a drink.
Oh, so it's blackmail !
Boss!
Now you're dead !
Looks like he's waking up!
I'm not afraid.
You can kill me.
But there'll be thousands more of me!
You want to play tough?
The Axe Gang boss is napping in there.
Whoever wants to die, step forward.
So you want to fight?
Great!
We'll go one-on-one.
Don't even think about cheating.
That old woman with the onion !
You look real tough.
Want to try me?
I'll let you hit me first.
-What do you do?
-l'm a farmer.
Farmers don't fight.
Piss off!
He's crazy!
Calling me names?
You're lucky you're a woman.
Hey, shorty!
Yeah, you !
If you're short, you don't retort.
What did I say about cheating?
Sit back down !
You !
The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.
No, not you. I mean... .
You !
Hey, kid, let's rumble!
All right, all right!
So no one-on-ones today.
You're all such wimps!
He blackmailed me.
Fat woman, you're in charge here, right?
Fat woman, my ass!
I'm with the Axe Gang !
Axe Gang, my ass!
Boss!
Boss, my ass!
-You have to pay our medical bills!
-Bills, my ass!
-We're on the same side!
-Same side, my ass!
Think you're so tough?
I'll call for backup!
You nitwit!
Let's see you call backup!
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.
Don't you go away!
Go put a down payment on your coffin !
Who threw the firecracker?
I'm one of you, brother.
Mind your own business!
It's raining.
Go bring in your laundry!
Fat woman !
You blackmailing me too?
I ain't afraid.
I... .
Did anyone see what happened?
Don't!
My back's broken !
Call for help!
Hold on, calm down.
You hungry?
Keep quiet.
No.
Who did this?
I'll count to three.
One...
... two....
I did it!
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?
Sorry!
Look away, kid.
Get rid of him !
We're the bad guys!
We're meant to do the ass-kicking...
... nottheotherwayaround.
And it's all because these morons posed as Axes.
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.
We'll handle this.
You !
Take care of it.
-Boy, can this guy pick locks.
-lt's a living.
Give me a break.
Pick that one too, if you're so good.
Come.
I'll count to three.
Hurry!
Ready?
Three!
That's quick!
Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will !
Go on !
Thank you, Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before, you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living !
The streets out there are filled with money and women.
You only need the will and determination...
... toseizetheopportunitytowin.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone, and we're in the gang.
Then it'll be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars...
... withnoambition.
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'll smash your glasses!
Get lost!
Come here and say that!
-You're really gonna kill someone?
-That's right!
The four-eyes, the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty.
But they're good at kung fu.
-l can do kung fu !
-Oh, yeah?
Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist Palm kung fu?
Hey there, handsome boy.
Stop.
Amazing !
Do you know you have a special aura?
You're so young, but you have the bone structure...
and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.
If your chi flow can be channeled, then you will be invincible!
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.
The duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours.
Sure.
This is the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
It's priceless.
But as it's fate, I'll let you have it for $1 0.
buddhist PALM MANUAL
-You gave him your life savings?
-Yes.
I was saving to study to be a doctor or lawyer...
... butthiswas worldpeace.
Let go of the girl !
Hey!
It's the Buddhist Palm !
"The 20-Cent Kung Fu Manual."
You must be loaded.
Have you killed anyone lately?
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
I realized then that good guys never win. I want to be bad.
I want to be the killer!
-Ice cream !
-Where?
Make mine a vanilla.
Chocolate for me!
What're you looking at?
Never seen free ice cream before?
Look at her run !
You're such kung-fu masters, go take it on the road.
You belong in the circus, not here!
Don't say that, Landlady.
There must be a reason they're here.
Everyone has his reasons.
We don't want to make trouble.
I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.
We'll never hear the end of it.
Why don't you get lost!
Your wife shouldn't be so nasty.
You okay?
Masters.
We have nothing precious to give you...
... buttakethisasatoken of our appreciation.
Thanks for saving us!
Stop the crying.
This isn't a show!
-You're so cold-hearted.
-Talking back to me, eh?
You may know kung fu, but you're still a fairy.
It's no crime to be good at kung fu !
Once a fairy, always a fairy.
Look at you.
What's with the red underwear?
Why not a diaper while you're at it.
What's wrong with red underwear?
Where were you when there was trouble?
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.
Be reasonable!
I'll reason with you.
You owe me three months' rent.
That's $90.
Pay up or pack up!
Don't you worry. I'll pay it.
Think you're a smartass, Rabbit-Tooth Jane?
What's it to you, tub of lard?
Bitch !
Calm down, Landlady.
This is your fault.
-Are you trying to kill us?
-You're right.
How could you do that?
Shut the hell up!
You think you can out-yell me?
The fat lady can really sing.
Watch this!
What happened?
What do you mean, what happened?
You try it.
-Me?
-Quick!
Sorry!
You okay?
I think you should get closer and take better aim.
Okay?
Okay!
-Who's throwing the handles?
-Handle?
Where's the third knife?
God knows where it went.
Could it be the same one?
Can't be... .
-Don't!
-Sorry.
What are you trying to say?
I just remembered I have something to do.
See you !
Uh-oh.
They've seen us!
Stay back!
Don't panic!
Snakes like music.
If I whistle, they won't bite.
Please, no more bright ideas.
Oh, what the hell !
Not you again, asshole!
Get back to your business!
Split up!
Split?
What're you doing here?
Looking for you.
Weren't you hurt?
I'm fine!
How come you always recover so fast?
I don't know.
-Which hospital did you go to?
-Don't remember.
Maybe it's better that way.
Memories can be painful.
To forget may be a blessing !
I never knew you were so deep.
All the sadness one can bear...
... downtherivereverywhere.
Hey, get out of the way!
Move!
I'll slap you to kingdom come!
Look at those four-eyes carting around a coffin.
What morons!
Don't blame me for making you leave.
We'll let Buddha decide...
... whetheryoustay...
... orgo.
HORRlFlCALLY BAD FATE
Have some tea.
We're grateful for some professional help.
We understand the problem.
Twelve Kicks from the Tam School...
... IronFistfromtheHungSchool and the Hexagon Staff... .
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.
Their warrior days are long over...
... butthey'restilltopfighters.
This job is a great challenge for us.
Now, that's professionalism.
Number One Killers.
Expensive, yes, but worth every penny!
No!
Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer.
He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
Strictly speaking, we're just musicians.
A song that wrenches the heart O where do I find a knowing ear?
Great poem, isn't it?
We'll be saying goodbye soon.
Who knows when we'll see each other again.
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a lot to pack.
You're right.
Twelve Kicks of the Tam School !
Superb attack and defense!
Iron Fist: powerful yet delicate.
Topnotch !
Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves.
Mystical !
Till we meet again !
More lipstick!
Stay there, or I'll break you in half.
Sorry, we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material !
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories... .
Insulting the Axe Gang !
We'll show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good !
Don't block my view!
Damn !
I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here.
-Really?
-Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry. lt's nothing !
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry, sorry!
Get out of my way!
Hang in there, Tailor.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the last we'll see of them.
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down !
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
People are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you...
... I cannowdie inpeace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.
Years ago...
... wesawouronlysonkilledinafight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters...

Becoming a top fighter takes time.
Unless you're a natural-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.
It's obvious I'm the one!
Don't think so.
Everyone!
We swore we'd never fight again.
But we broke that promise today.
For your own safety, please all leave!
In great power lies great responsibility.
There's no escaping from it.
Donut, you're hurt bad.
Rest now.
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
I know you, four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-challenged.
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?
Help me!
"Help me!
Help me!" Want to play, punks?
The Dragon Style?
The Tiger Style?
Come down here, and I'll smash your glasses.
Come on !
You know I'd do it, right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes...
... allbecauseof you!
You're a numb-nut!
Follow me!
It's a stickup!
Where's the money?
Where's the money?
What're you looking at?

Give me the money.
The money's in here.

Go away!
You're dragging me down !
Go home and raise pigs.
Go, before I kill you.

is he okay?
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun !
In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
The real masters, together in one room !
Only the world's top killer...
... hassuchanaura .
Likewise.
Could you two be the fated lovers... ?
Paris...
... andHelenof Troy!
A pleasure, indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang...
... andonlytheAxe Gang.
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
With the Beast here, let's see whose funeral it is!
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you...
... orbekilledbyyou.
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
Piece of cake. I can handle this.
Good try, but a little off target.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
-Looks like they're not up to it!
-Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
-l'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
-Go to hell !
You !
Come over here.
-Hit him !
-Yes!
-The head !
-Of course!
-Hit him on the head !
-Okay.
-Here's your chance.
-Got it!
-Hit him !
-Hit him !
-Hit the shit out of him !
-Right!
-Hit him !
-Hit him !
Beat the shit out of him !
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused !
Wow, that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
No one gets away from me!
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at least he finally made good.
Look at him !
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey, wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
There's no one here!
chinese medicine
It's a miracle he lasted this long.
The herbs should help him.
Herbal medicine can only partly help.
The key is his own body structure.
All his bones and tendons are broken.
It's amazing he's recovering so fast.
It can't be possible... .
Unless he's... .
What's that smell?
You mustn't smoke while you're hurt.
Let me handle this.
This makes no sense.
Who knew the Beast could clear the chi flow...
... andthusunleash the boy's true potential?
We should've guessed.
He is the one!
is this for real?
You're still alive, you turncoat?
Kill him, men !
What kind of move is that?
Kids' stuff!
If our son were alive, he'd be his age now.
If he studies hard, he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer.
A stuntman, more likely!
Not bad.
Let's go.
I can even stop bullets--
What?
The Toad Style of the Kwan Lun School?
Oh, no!
Remember the Palm move that falls from heaven?
That's the long lost Buddhist Palm.
I surrender!
What kind of move was that?
If you want to learn, I'll teach you.
Master!
Hey!
Tell him not to put snot on the glass.
You two, put your pants on !
No licking if you're not buying !
Kid, you have the bone structure of a kung-fu genius.
World peace is in your hands.
Here's the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
Because it's fate, I'll let you have it for $1 0.
Wait!
You want more... ?

Commissioner is only your boss because he paid his dues to the Crocodile Gang.
And you don't fucking know me?
Sorry, I didn't know she was your wife.
Ugly coward!
What are you looking at?
Never seen such a handsome gang boss?
Who'd be in the film business?
It's Sunday, and the theatre's deserted.
Where's the car?
Let's go back inside!
Call for help!
No need for that, Northerner.
While you were messing with the cop, your men signed up with us.
I'll kill all you Axe Gangsters!
Stop!
You forget the time I treated you to dinner.

Please...
Please spare me.
Don't worry.
I don't kill women.

THE AXE GANG

In a time of social unrest and disorder the gangs have moved in to consolidate their power.

NOODLES AND CONGEE
My check, please, Donut.
- How much?
- It's on the house!
Donut.
- It's nothing.
- I like you.
I'll ask the wife about lowering your rent.
Morning, Landlord!
Landlord!
Jill!
How you've grown!
Come let me examine you!
Good to see you, Landlord!
What's so good about it?
Don't...!
Can you make the skirt slit higher?
Sure!
Look, a comet!
Jane!
You naughty girl!
Landlord!
You're such a scoundrel!
Don't go, Jane!
Stay and chat!
I'm only kidding.
Jane!
Landlady!
Landlady!
What happened to the water?
Water ain't free!
You talk a lot for someone who won't pay his rent.
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.
You think that's a problem?
From now on, no water on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
I just love hearing you fools complain.
Assholes!
Good morning, Landlady!
Just pay your rent, or I'll burn your shop down.
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter, fairy!
Serves you right you're a coolie!
Months overdue and not even a "good morning."
You'll be a coolie for life.
There you go, handsome!
What took you so long with the congee?
I stopped to help an old lady cross the street.
- What are you doing here?
- Checking for Peeping Toms.
Was someone just spying on you, Auntie Six?
Don't shoot your mouth off without proof.
She's crazy.
Go away!
Please can you teach us, sir?
No more soccer!
- Who wants the cut?
- My boss.
Take a seat.
Done!
Fifty cents, please.
Isn't it great?
It's too good!
Why'd you make him look so good?
Why?
Don't get mad, boss.
He's my old buddy.
I'll handle this.
He's boss of the Axe Gang.
Don't you see the two axes?
We're bad guys.
Making him look good is really bad.
Understand?
- I didn't know.
- You're a numskull!
But I like you, so just pay me, and I'll take care of it.
No way!
Steady with the axe, boss.
Let me talk to him.
I really care for you.
You saw it for yourself.
Seriously.
Why don't you pay up.
Not much.
Enough for a drink.
Oh, so it's blackmail!
Boss!
Boss!
Now you're dead!
Looks like he's waking up!
I'm not afraid.
You can kill me.
But there'll be thousands more of me!
You want to play tough?
The Axe Gang boss is napping in there.
Whoever wants to die, step forward.
So you want to fight?
Great!
We'll go one-on-one.
Don't even think about cheating.
That old woman with the onion!
You look real tough.
Want to try me?
I'll let you hit me first.
What do you do?
I'm a farmer.
Farmers don't fight.
Piss off!
He's crazy!
Calling me names?
You're lucky you're a woman.
Hey, shorty!
Yeah, you!
If you're short, you don't retort.
What did I say about cheating?
Sit back down!
You!
The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.
No, not you.
I mean...
You!
Hey, kid, let's rumble!
All right, all right!
So no one-on-ones today.
You're all such wimps!
He blackmailed me.
Fat woman, you're in charge here, right?
Fat woman, my ass!
I'm with the Axe Gang!
Axe Gang, my ass!
Boss!
Boss, my ass!
- You have to pay our medical bills!
- Bills, my ass!
- We're on the same side!
- Same side, my ass!
Think you're so tough?
I'll call for backup!
You nitwit!
Let's see you call backup!
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.
Don't you go away!
Go put a down payment on your coffin!
Who threw the firecracker?
I'm one of you, brother.
Mind your own business!
It's raining.
Go bring in your laundry!
Fat woman!
You blackmailing me too?
I ain't afraid.
I...
Did anyone see what happened?
Don't!
My back's broken!
Call for help!
Hold on, calm down.
You hungry?
Keep quiet.
No.
Who did this?
I'll count to three.
One two...
I did it!
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?
Sorry!
Look away, kid.
Get rid of him!
We're the bad guys!
We're meant to do the ass-kicking not the other way around.
And it's all because these morons posed as Axes.
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.
We'll handle this.
You!
Take care of it.
- Boy, can this guy pick locks.
- It's a living.
Give me a break.
Pick that one too, if you're so good.
Come.
I'll count to three.
Hurry!
Ready?
Three!
That's quick!
Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will!
Go on!
Thank you, Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before, you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living!
The streets out there are filled with money and women.
You only need the will and determination to seize the opportunity to win.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone, and we're in the gang.
Then it'll be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars with no ambition.
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'll smash your glasses!
Get lost!
Come here and say that!
- You're really gonna kill someone?
- That's right!
The four-eyes, the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty.
But they're good at kung fu.
- I can do kung fu!
- Oh, yeah?
Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist Palm kung fu?
Hey there, handsome boy.
Stop.
Amazing!
Do you know you have a special aura?
You're so young, but you have the bone structure... and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.
If your chi flow can be channelled, then you will be invincible!
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.
The duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours.
Sure.
This is the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
It's priceless.
But as it's fate, I'll let you have it for $10.
BUDDHIST PALM MANU AL
- You gave him your life savings?
- Yes.
I was saving to study to be a doctor or lawyer but this was world peace.
Let go of the girl!
Hey!
It's the Buddhist Palm!
"The 20-Cent Kung Fu Manual."
You must be loaded.
Have you killed anyone lately?
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
I realized then that good guys never win.
I want to be bad.
I want to be the killer!
- Ice cream!
- Where?
Make mine a vanilla.
Chocolate for me!
What're you looking at?
Never seen free ice cream before?
Look at her run!
You're such kung-fu masters, go take it on the road.
You belong in the circus, not here!
Don't say that, Landlady.
There must be a reason they're here.
Everyone has his reasons.
We don't want to make trouble.
I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.
We'll never hear the end of it.
Why don't you get lost!
Your wife shouldn't be so nasty.
You okay?
Masters.
We have nothing precious to give you but take this as a token of our appreciation.
Thanks for saving us!
Stop the crying.
This isn't a show!
- You're so cold-hearted.
- Talking back to me, eh?
You may know kung fu, but you're still a fairy.
It's no crime to be good at kung fu!
Once a fairy, always a fairy.
Look at you.
What's with the red underwear?
Why not a diaper while you're at it.
What's wrong with red underwear?
Where were you when there was trouble?
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.
Be reasonable!
I'll reason with you.
You owe me three months' rent.
That's $90.
Pay up or pack up!
Don't you worry.
I'll pay it.
Think you're a smartass, Rabbit-Tooth Jane?
What's it to you, tub of lard?
Bitch!
Calm down, Landlady.
This is your fault.
- Are you trying to kill us?
- You're right.
How could you do that?
Shut the hell up!
You think you can out-yell me?
The fat lady can really sing.
Watch this!
What happened?
What do you mean, what happened?
You try it.
- Me?
- Quick!
Sorry!
You okay?
I think you should get closer and take better aim.
Okay?
Okay!
- Who's throwing the handles?
- Handle?
Where's the third knife?
God knows where it went.
Could it be the same one?
Can't be...
- Don't!
- Sorry.
What are you trying to say?
I just remembered I have something to do.
See you!
Uh-oh.
They've seen us!
Stay back!
Don't panic!
Snakes like music.
If I whistle, they won't bite.
Please, no more bright ideas.
Oh, what the hell!
Not you again, asshole!
Get back to your business!
Split up!
Split?
What're you doing here?
Looking for you.
Weren't you hurt?
I'm fine!
How come you always recover so fast?
I don't know.
- Which hospital did you go to?
- Don't remember.
Maybe it's better that way.
Memories can be painful.
To forget may be a blessing!
I never knew you were so deep.
All the sadness one can bear down the river everywhere.
Hey, get out of the way!
Move!
I'll slap you to kingdom come!
Look at those four-eyes carting around a coffin.
What morons!
Don't blame me for making you leave.
We'll let Buddha decide whether you stay or go.
HORRIFICALLY BAD FATE
Have some tea.
We're grateful for some professional help.
We understand the problem.
Twelve Kicks from the Tam School Iron Fist from the Hung School and the Hexagon Staff...
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.
Their warrior days are long over but they're still top fighters.
This job is a great challenge for us.
Now, that's professionalism.
Number One Killers.
Expensive, yes, but worth every penny!
No!
Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer.
He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
Strictly speaking, we're just musicians.
A song that wrenches the heart O where do I find a knowing ear?
Great poem, isn't it?
We'll be saying goodbye soon.
Who knows when we'll see each other again.
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a lot to pack.
You're right.
Twelve Kicks of the Tam School!
Superb attack and defence!
Iron Fist:
Powerful yet delicate.
Top-notch!
Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves.
Mystical!
Till we meet again!
More lipstick!
Stay there, or I'll break you in half.
Sorry, we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material!
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories...
Insulting the Axe Gang!
We'll show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good!
Don't block my view!
Damn!
I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry.
It's nothing!
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry, sorry!
Get out of my way!
Hang in there, Tailor.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the last we'll see of them.
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down!
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
People are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you I can now die in peace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.
Years ago we saw our only son killed in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters and we'll avenge them!
Becoming a top fighter takes time.
Unless you're a natural-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.
It's obvious I'm the one!
Don't think so.
Everyone!
We swore we'd never fight again.
But we broke that promise today.
For your own safety, please all leave!
In great power lies great responsibility.
There's no escaping from it.
Donut, you're hurt bad.
Rest now.
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
I know you, four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-challenged.
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?
Help me!
"Help me!
Help me!" Want to play, punks?
The Dragon Style?
The Tiger Style?
Come down here, and I'll smash your glasses.
Come on!
You know I'd do it, right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes all because of you!
You're a numb-nut!
Follow me!
It's a stickup!
Where's the money?
Where's the money?
What're you looking at?
I'm serious!
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.
The money's in here.
Let go of the girl!
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
Go away!
You're dragging me down!
Go home and raise pigs.
Go, before I kill you.
You!
Whatsyourname!
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!
- For real?
- Someone's waiting for you.
Brother Sum!
One look at you, and I knew you'd do anything.
Right!
You just needed your chance.
Damn right!
We've an assignment for you.
Anything, Brother Sum!
"Research on abnormal people." What's that?
A mental asylum.
Soldiers!
Boy Scouts!
Tanks!
No worries.
When the Boy Scouts change shifts, you have exactly five minutes.
Follow the arrows on the map.
Go to the last cell and get the man inside there out.
Here's your tools.
What about you guys?
We're your lookouts.
Five minutes.
Hurry!
The world's top killer indeed looks the part!
It's only a title.
Cut the bullshit.
We want two people killed.
Name your price.
Name my what?
I've killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary.
So far, I've never found one.
That's why I stayed inside.
Had I met my match, I'd have been out long ago.
If you find me a worthy opponent I'll do it for free.
No charge!
Do you have someone?
Yes.
Brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge.
But first, will you show us some moves?
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.
You numskulls aren't worthy!
He doesn't look the part.
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'll clean up well.
You sure you got the right guy?
Absolutely.
I swear I did exactly what you told me.
Please show us some moves, Mr. Beast.
Don't make it hard for me!
You dumb or what?
You know what this is, old man?
Ever seen a fist this big?
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!
Really?
Try me, then.
Is he okay?
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
Harder!
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun!
In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
The real masters, together in one room!
Only the world's top killer has such an aura.
Likewise.
Could you two be the fated lovers...?
Paris and Helen of Troy!
A pleasure, indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang and only the Axe Gang.
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
With the Beast here, let's see whose funeral it is!
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you or be killed by you.
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
Piece of cake.
I can handle this.
Good try, but a little off target.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
- Looks like they're not up to it!
- Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
- I'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
- Go to hell!
You!
Come over here.
- Hit him!
- Yes!
- The head!
- Of course!
- Hit him on the head!
- Okay.
- Here's your chance.
- Got it!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
- Hit the shit out of him!
- Right!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
Beat the shit out of him!
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused!
Wow, that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
No one gets away from me!
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at least he finally made good.
Look at him!
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey, wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
There's no one here!
CHINESE MEDICINE

We should've guessed.
He is the one!
Is this for real?
You're still alive, you turncoat?
Kill him, men!
What kind of move is that?
Kids' stuff!
If our son were alive, he'd be his age now.
If he studies hard, he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer.

Look, a comet!
Jane!
You naughty girl!
Landlord!
You're such a scoundrel!
Don't go, Jane!
Stay and chat!
I'm only kidding.
Jane!
Landlady!
Landlady!
What happened to the water?
Water ain't free!
You talk a lot for someone who won't pay his rent.
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.
You think that's a problem?
From now on, no water on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
I just love hearing you fools complain.
Assholes!
Good morning, Landlady!
Just pay your rent, or I'll burn your shop down.
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter, fairy!
Serves you right you're a coolie!
Months overdue and not even a "good morning."
You'll be a coolie for life.
There you go, handsome!
What took you so long with the congee?
I stopped to help an old lady cross the street.
- What are you doing here?
- Checking for Peeping Toms.
Was someone just spying on you, Auntie Six?
Don't shoot your mouth off without proof.
She's crazy.
Go away!
Please can you teach us, sir?
No more soccer!
- Who wants the cut?
- My boss.
Take a seat.
Done!
Fifty cents, please.
Isn't it great?
It's too good!
Why'd you make him look so good?
Why?
Don't get mad, boss.
He's my old buddy.
I'll handle this.
He's boss of the Axe Gang.
Don't you see the two axes?
We're bad guys.
Making him look good is really bad.
Understand?
- I didn't know.
- You're a numskull!
But I like you, so just pay me, and I'll take care of it.
No way!
Steady with the axe, boss.
Let me talk to him.
I really care for you.
You saw it for yourself.
Seriously.
Why don't you pay up.
Not much.
Enough for a drink.
Oh, so it's blackmail!
Boss!
Boss!
Now you're dead!
Looks like he's waking up!
I'm not afraid.
You can kill me.
But there'll be thousands more of me!
You want to play tough?
The Axe Gang boss is napping in there.
Whoever wants to die, step forward.
So you want to fight?
Great!
We'll go one-on-one.
Don't even think about cheating.
That old woman with the onion!
You look real tough.
Want to try me?
I'll let you hit me first.
What do you do?
I'm a farmer.
Farmers don't fight.
Piss off!
He's crazy!
Calling me names?
You're lucky you're a woman.
Hey, shorty!
Yeah, you!
If you're short, you don't retort.
What did I say about cheating?
Sit back down!
You!
The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.
No, not you.
I mean...
You!
Hey, kid, let's rumble!
All right, all right!
So no one-on-ones today.
You're all such wimps!
He blackmailed me.
Fat woman, you're in charge here, right?
Fat woman, my ass!
I'm with the Axe Gang!
Axe Gang, my ass!
Boss!
Boss, my ass!
- You have to pay our medical bills!
- Bills, my ass!
- We're on the same side!
- Same side, my ass!
Think you're so tough?
I'll call for backup!
You nitwit!
Let's see you call backup!
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.
Don't you go away!
Go put a down payment on your coffin!
Who threw the firecracker?
I'm one of you, brother.
Mind your own business!
It's raining.
Go bring in your laundry!
Fat woman!
You blackmailing me too?
I ain't afraid.
I...
Did anyone see what happened?
Don't!
My back's broken!
Call for help!
Hold on, calm down.
You hungry?
Keep quiet.
No.
Who did this?
I'll count to three.
One two...
I did it!
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?
Sorry!
Look away, kid.
Get rid of him!
We're the bad guys!
We're meant to do the ass-kicking not the other way around.
And it's all because these morons posed as Axes.
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.
We'll handle this.
You!
Take care of it.
- Boy, can this guy pick locks.
- It's a living.
Give me a break.
Pick that one too, if you're so good.
Come.
I'll count to three.
Hurry!
Ready?
Three!
That's quick!
Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will!
Go on!
Thank you, Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before, you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living!
The streets out there are filled with money and women.
You only need the will and determination to seize the opportunity to win.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone, and we're in the gang.
Then it'll be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars with no ambition.
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'll smash your glasses!
Get lost!
Come here and say that!
- You're really gonna kill someone?
- That's right!
The four-eyes, the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty.
But they're good at kung fu.
- I can do kung fu!
- Oh, yeah?
Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist Palm kung fu?
Hey there, handsome boy.
Stop.
Amazing!
Do you know you have a special aura?
You're so young, but you have the bone structure... and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.
If your chi flow can be channeled, then you will be invincible!
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.
The duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours.
Sure.
This is the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
It's priceless.
But as it's fate, I'll let you have it for $ 10.
BUDDHIST PALM MANUAL
- You gave him your life savings?
- Yes.
I was saving to study to be a doctor or lawyer but this was world peace.
Let go of the girl!
Hey!
It's the Buddhist Palm!
"The 20-Cent Kung Fu Manual."
You must be loaded.
Have you killed anyone lately?
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
I realized then that good guys never win.
I want to be bad.
I want to be the killer!
- Ice cream!
- Where?
Make mine a vanilla.
Chocolate for me!
What're you looking at?
Never seen free ice cream before?
Look at her run!
You're such kung-fu masters, go take it on the road.
You belong in the circus, not here!
Don't say that, Landlady.
There must be a reason they're here.
Everyone has his reasons.
We don't want to make trouble.
I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.
We'll never hear the end of it.
Why don't you get lost!
Your wife shouldn't be so nasty.
You okay?
Masters.
We have nothing precious to give you but take this as a token of our appreciation.
Thanks for saving us!
Stop the crying.
This isn't a show!
- You're so cold-hearted.
- Talking back to me, eh?
You may know kung fu, but you're still a fairy.
It's no crime to be good at kung fu!
Once a fairy, always a fairy.
Look at you.
What's with the red underwear?
Why not a diaper while you're at it.
What's wrong with red underwear?
Where were you when there was trouble?
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.
Be reasonable!
I'll reason with you.
You owe me three months' rent.
That's $90.
Pay up or pack up!
Don't you worry.
I'll pay it.
Think you're a smartass, Rabbit-Tooth Jane?
What's it to you, tub of lard?
Bitch!
Calm down, Landlady.
This is your fault.
- Are you trying to kill us?
- You're right.
How could you do that?
Shut the hell up!
You think you can out-yell me?
The fat lady can really sing.
Watch this!
What happened?
What do you mean, what happened?
You try it.
- Me?
- Quick!
Sorry!
You okay?
I think you should get closer and take better aim.
Okay?
Okay!
- Who's throwing the handles?
- Handle?
Where's the third knife?
God knows where it went.
Could it be the same one?
Can't be...
- Don't!
- Sorry.
What are you trying to say?
I just remembered I have something to do.
See you!
Uh-oh.
They've seen us!
Stay back!
Don't panic!
Snakes like music.
If I whistle, they won't bite.
Please, no more bright ideas.
Oh, what the hell!
Not you again, asshole!
Get back to your business!
Split up!
Split?
What're you doing here?
Looking for you.
Weren't you hurt?
I'm fine!
How come you always recover so fast?
I don't know.
- Which hospital did you go to?
- Don't remember.
Maybe it's better that way.
Memories can be painful.
To forget may be a blessing!
I never knew you were so deep.
All the sadness one can bear down the river everywhere.
Hey, get out of the way!
Move!
I'll slap you to kingdom come!
Look at those four-eyes carting around a coffin.
What morons!
Don't blame me for making you leave.
We'll let Buddha decide whether you stay or go.
HORRIFICALLY BAD FATE
Have some tea.
We're grateful for some professional help.
We understand the problem.
Twelve Kicks from the Tam School Iron Fist from the Hung School and the Hexagon Staff...
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.
Their warrior days are long over but they're still top fighters.
This job is a great challenge for us.
Now, that's professionalism.
Number One Killers.
Expensive, yes, but worth every penny!
No!
Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer.
He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
Strictly speaking, we're just musicians.
A song that wrenches the heart O where do I find a knowing ear?
Great poem, isn't it?
We'll be saying goodbye soon.
Who knows when we'll see each other again.
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a lot to pack.
You're right.
Twelve Kicks of the Tam School!
Superb attack and defense!
Iron Fist: powerful yet delicate.
Topnotch!
Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves.
Mystical!
Till we meet again!
More lipstick!
Stay there, or I'll break you in half.
Sorry, we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material!
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories...
Insulting the Axe Gang!
We'll show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good!
Don't block my view!
Damn!
I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry.
It's nothing!
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry, sorry!
Get out of my way!
Hang in there, Tailor.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the last we'll see of them.
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down!
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
People are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you I can now die in peace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.
Years ago we saw our only son killed in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters and we'll avenge them!
Becoming a top fighter takes time.
Unless you're a natural-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.
It's obvious I'm the one!
Don't think so.
Everyone!
We swore we'd never fight again.
But we broke that promise today.
For your own safety, please all leave!
In great power lies great responsibility.
There's no escaping from it.
Donut, you're hurt bad.
Rest now.
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
I know you, four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-challenged.
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?
Help me!
"Help me!
Help me!" Want to play, punks?
The Dragon Style?
The Tiger Style?
Come down here, and I'll smash your glasses.
Come on!
You know I'd do it, right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes all because of you!
You're a numb-nut!
Follow me!
It's a stickup!
Where's the money?
Where's the money?
What're you looking at?
I'm serious!
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.
The money's in here.
Let go of the girl!
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
Go away!
You're dragging me down!
Go home and raise pigs.
Go, before I kill you.
You!
Whatsyourname!
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!
- For real?
- Someone's waiting for you.
Brother Sum!
One look at you, and I knew you'd do anything.
Right!
You just needed your chance.
Damn right!
We've an assignment for you.
Anything, Brother Sum!
"Research on abnormal people." What's that?
A mental asylum.
Soldiers!
Boy Scouts!
Tanks!
No worries.
When the Boy Scouts change shifts, you have exactly five minutes.
Follow the arrows on the map.
Go to the last cell and get the man inside there out.
Here's your tools.
What about you guys?
We're your lookouts.
Five minutes.
Hurry!
The world's top killer indeed looks the part!
It's only a title.
Cut the bullshit.
We want two people killed.
Name your price.
Name my what?
I've killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary.
So far, I've never found one.
That's why I stayed inside.
Had I met my match, I'd have been out long ago.
If you find me a worthy opponent I'll do it for free.
No charge!
Do you have someone?
Yes.
Brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge.
But first, will you show us some moves?
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.
You numskulls aren't worthy!
He doesn't look the part.
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'll clean up well.
You sure you got the right guy?
Absolutely.
I swear I did exactly what you told me.
Please show us some moves, Mr. Beast.
Don't make it hard for me!
You dumb or what?
You know what this is, old man?
Ever seen a fist this big?
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!
Really?
Try me, then.
Is he okay?
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
Harder!
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun!
In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
The real masters, together in one room!
Only the world's top killer has such an aura.
Likewise.
Could you two be the fated lovers...?
Paris and Helen of Troy!
A pleasure, indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang and only the Axe Gang.
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
With the Beast here, let's see whose funeral it is!
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you or be killed by you.
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
Piece of cake.
I can handle this.
Good try, but a little off target.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
- Looks like they're not up to it!
- Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
- I'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
- Go to hell!
You!
Come over here.
- Hit him!
- Yes!
- The head!
- Of course!
- Hit him on the head!
- Okay.
- Here's your chance.
- Got it!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
- Hit the shit out of him!
- Right!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
Beat the shit out of him!
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused!
Wow, that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
No one gets away from me!
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at least he finally made good.
Look at him!
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey, wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
There's no one here!
CHINESE MEDICINE
It's a miracle he lasted this long.
The herbs should help him.
Herbal medicine can only partly help.
The key is his own body structure.
All his bones and tendons are broken.
It's amazing he's recovering so fast.
It can't be possible...
Unless he's...
What's that smell?
You mustn't smoke while you're hurt.
Let me handle this.
This makes no sense.
Who knew the Beast could clear the chi flow and thus unleash the boy's true potential?
We should've guessed.
He is the one!
Is this for real?
You're still alive, you turncoat?
Kill him, men!
What kind of move is that?
Kids' stuff!
If our son were alive, he'd be his age now.
If he studies hard, he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer.
A stuntman, more likely!
Not bad.
Let's go.
I can even stop bullets...
What?
The Toad Style of the Kwan Lun School?
Oh, no!
Remember the Palm move that falls from heaven?
That's the long lost Buddhist Palm.
I surrender!
What kind of move was that?
If you want to learn, I'll teach you.
Master!
Hey!
Tell him not to put snot on the glass.
You two, put your pants on!
No licking if you're not buying!
Kid, you have the bone structure of a kung-fu genius.
World peace is in your hands.
Here's the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
Because it's fate, I'll let you have it for $ 10.
Wait!
You want more...?
INSPECTOR CHAN
SUPER CRIME FIGHTERS
Anyone else?
Such a beautiful woman and you arrest her just for spitting?
Is there no justice?
Is there no law?
Commissioner is only your boss because he paid his dues to the Crocodile Gang.
And you don't fucking know me?
Sorry, I didn't know she was your wife.
Ugly coward!
What are you looking at?
Never seen such a handsome gang boss?
Who'd be in the film business?
It's Sunday, and the theater's deserted.
Where's the car?
Let's go back inside!
Call for help!
No need for that, Northerner.
While you were messing with the cop, your men signed up with us.
I'll kill all you Axe Gangsters!
Stop!
You forget the time I treated you to dinner.
Brother Sum.
Please...
Please spare me.
Don't worry.
I don't kill women.
You can go!
Thank you, Big Brother.
Cops!
Come clean up the mess!
THE AXE GANG
In a time of social unrest and disorder...
In a time of social unrest and disorder the gangs have moved in to consolidate their power.
The most feared of them all is the Axe Gang.
Only in the poorest districts, which hold no interest for the gangs can people live in peace.
PIG STY ALLE Y
One, two, three!
- That okay, Coolie?
- No problem!
TAILOR
NOODLES AND CONGEE
My check, please, Donut.
- How much?
- It's on the house!
Donut.
- It's nothing.
- I like you.
I'll ask the wife about lowering your rent.
Morning, Landlord!
Landlord!
Jill!
How you've grown!
Come let me examine you!
Good to see you, Landlord!
What's so good about it?
Don't...!
Can you make the skirt slit higher?
Sure!
Look, a comet!
Jane!
You naughty girl!
Landlord!
You're such a scoundrel!
Don't go, Jane!
Stay and chat!
I'm only kidding.
Jane!
Landlady!
Landlady!
What happened to the water?
Water ain't free!
You talk a lot for someone who won't pay his rent.
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.
You think that's a problem?
From now on, no water on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
I just love hearing you fools complain.
Assholes!
Good morning, Landlady!
Just pay your rent, or I'll burn your shop down.
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter, fairy!
Serves you right you're a coolie!
Months overdue and not even a "good morning."
You'll be a coolie for life.
There you go, handsome!
What took you so long with the congee?
I stopped to help an old lady cross the street.
- What are you doing here?
- Checking for Peeping Toms.
Was someone just spying on you, Auntie Six?
Don't shoot your mouth off without proof.
She's crazy.
Go away!
Please can you teach us, sir?
No more soccer!
- Who wants the cut?
- My boss.
Take a seat.
Done!
Fifty cents, please.
Isn't it great?
It's too good!
Why'd you make him look so good?
Why?
Don't get mad, boss.
He's my old buddy.
I'll handle this.
He's boss of the Axe Gang.
Don't you see the two axes?
We're bad guys.
Making him look good is really bad.
Understand?
- I didn't know.
- You're a numskull!
But I like you, so just pay me, and I'll take care of it.
No way!
Steady with the axe, boss.
Let me talk to him.
I really care for you.
You saw it for yourself.
Seriously.
Why don't you pay up.
Not much.
Enough for a drink.
Oh, so it's blackmail!
Boss!
Boss!
Now you're dead!
Looks like he's waking up!
I'm not afraid.
You can kill me.
But there'll be thousands more of me!
You want to play tough?
The Axe Gang boss is napping in there.
Whoever wants to die, step forward.
So you want to fight?
Great!
We'll go one-on-one.
Don't even think about cheating.
That old woman with the onion!
You look real tough.
Want to try me?
I'll let you hit me first.
What do you do?
I'm a farmer.
Farmers don't fight.
Piss off!
He's crazy!
Calling me names?
You're lucky you're a woman.
Hey, shorty!
Yeah, you!
If you're short, you don't retort.
What did I say about cheating?
Sit back down!
You!
The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.
No, not you.
I mean...
You!
Hey, kid, let's rumble!
All right, all right!
So no one-on-ones today.
You're all such wimps!
He blackmailed me.
Fat woman, you're in charge here, right?
Fat woman, my ass!
I'm with the Axe Gang!
Axe Gang, my ass!
Boss!
Boss, my ass!
- You have to pay our medical bills!
- Bills, my ass!
- We're on the same side!
- Same side, my ass!
Think you're so tough?
I'll call for backup!
You nitwit!
Let's see you call backup!
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.
Don't you go away!
Go put a down payment on your coffin!
Who threw the firecracker?
I'm one of you, brother.
Mind your own business!
It's raining.
Go bring in your laundry!
Fat woman!
You blackmailing me too?
I ain't afraid.
I...
Did anyone see what happened?
Don't!
My back's broken!
Call for help!
Hold on, calm down.
You hungry?
Keep quiet.
No.
Who did this?
I'll count to three.
One two...
I did it!
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?
Sorry!
Look away, kid.
Get rid of him!
We're the bad guys!
We're meant to do the ass-kicking not the other way around.
And it's all because these morons posed as Axes.
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.
We'll handle this.
You!
Take care of it.
- Boy, can this guy pick locks.
- It's a living.
Give me a break.
Pick that one too, if you're so good.
Come.
I'll count to three.
Hurry!
Ready?
Three!
That's quick!
Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will!
Go on!
Thank you, Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before, you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living!
The streets out there are filled with money and women.
You only need the will and determination to seize the opportunity to win.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone, and we're in the gang.
Then it'll be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars with no ambition.
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'll smash your glasses!
Get lost!
Come here and say that!
- You're really gonna kill someone?
- That's right!
The four-eyes, the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty.
But they're good at kung fu.
- I can do kung fu!
- Oh, yeah?
Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist Palm kung fu?
Hey there, handsome boy.
Stop.
Amazing!
Do you know you have a special aura?
You're so young, but you have the bone structure... and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.
If your chi flow can be channeled, then you will be invincible!
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.
The duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours.
Sure.
This is the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
It's priceless.
But as it's fate, I'll let you have it for $ 10.
BUDDHIST PALM MANUAL
- You gave him your life savings?
- Yes.
I was saving to study to be a doctor or lawyer but this was world peace.
Let go of the girl!
Hey!
It's the Buddhist Palm!
"The 20-Cent Kung Fu Manual."
You must be loaded.
Have you killed anyone lately?
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
I realized then that good guys never win.
I want to be bad.
I want to be the killer!
- Ice cream!
- Where?
Make mine a vanilla.
Chocolate for me!
What're you looking at?
Never seen free ice cream before?
Look at her run!
You're such kung-fu masters, go take it on the road.
You belong in the circus, not here!
Don't say that, Landlady.
There must be a reason they're here.
Everyone has his reasons.
We don't want to make trouble.
I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.
We'll never hear the end of it.
Why don't you get lost!
Your wife shouldn't be so nasty.
You okay?
Masters.
We have nothing precious to give you but take this as a token of our appreciation.
Thanks for saving us!
Stop the crying.
This isn't a show!
- You're so cold-hearted.
- Talking back to me, eh?
You may know kung fu, but you're still a fairy.
It's no crime to be good at kung fu!
Once a fairy, always a fairy.
Look at you.
What's with the red underwear?
Why not a diaper while you're at it.
What's wrong with red underwear?
Where were you when there was trouble?
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.
Be reasonable!
I'll reason with you.
You owe me three months' rent.
That's $90.
Pay up or pack up!
Don't you worry.
I'll pay it.
Think you're a smartass, Rabbit-Tooth Jane?
What's it to you, tub of lard?
Bitch!
Calm down, Landlady.
This is your fault.
- Are you trying to kill us?
- You're right.
How could you do that?
Shut the hell up!
You think you can out-yell me?
The fat lady can really sing.
Watch this!
What happened?
What do you mean, what happened?
You try it.
- Me?
- Quick!
Sorry!
You okay?
I think you should get closer and take better aim.
Okay?
Okay!
- Who's throwing the handles?
- Handle?
Where's the third knife?
God knows where it went.
Could it be the same one?
Can't be...
- Don't!
- Sorry.
What are you trying to say?
I just remembered I have something to do.
See you!
Uh-oh.
They've seen us!
Stay back!
Don't panic!
Snakes like music.
If I whistle, they won't bite.
Please, no more bright ideas.
Oh, what the hell!
Not you again, asshole!
Get back to your business!
Split up!
Split?
What're you doing here?
Looking for you.
Weren't you hurt?
I'm fine!
How come you always recover so fast?
I don't know.
- Which hospital did you go to?
- Don't remember.
Maybe it's better that way.
Memories can be painful.
To forget may be a blessing!
I never knew you were so deep.
All the sadness one can bear down the river everywhere.
Hey, get out of the way!
Move!
I'll slap you to kingdom come!
Look at those four-eyes carting around a coffin.
What morons!
Don't blame me for making you leave.
We'll let Buddha decide whether you stay or go.
HORRIFICALLY BAD FATE
Have some tea.
We're grateful for some professional help.
We understand the problem.
Twelve Kicks from the Tam School Iron Fist from the Hung School and the Hexagon Staff...
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.
Their warrior days are long over but they're still top fighters.
This job is a great challenge for us.
Now, that's professionalism.
Number One Killers.
Expensive, yes, but worth every penny!
No!
Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer.
He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
Strictly speaking, we're just musicians.
A song that wrenches the heart O where do I find a knowing ear?
Great poem, isn't it?
We'll be saying goodbye soon.
Who knows when we'll see each other again.
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a lot to pack.
You're right.
Twelve Kicks of the Tam School!
Superb attack and defense!
Iron Fist: powerful yet delicate.
Topnotch!
Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves.
Mystical!
Till we meet again!
More lipstick!
Stay there, or I'll break you in half.
Sorry, we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material!
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories...
Insulting the Axe Gang!
We'll show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good!
Don't block my view!
Damn!
I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry.
It's nothing!
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry, sorry!
Get out of my way!
Hang in there, Tailor.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the last we'll see of them.
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down!
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
People are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you I can now die in peace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.
Years ago we saw our only son killed in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters and we'll avenge them!
Becoming a top fighter takes time.
Unless you're a natural-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.
It's obvious I'm the one!
Don't think so.
Everyone!
We swore we'd never fight again.
But we broke that promise today.
For your own safety, please all leave!
In great power lies great responsibility.
There's no escaping from it.
Donut, you're hurt bad.
Rest now.
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
I know you, four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-challenged.
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?
Help me!
"Help me!
Help me!" Want to play, punks?
The Dragon Style?
The Tiger Style?
Come down here, and I'll smash your glasses.
Come on!
You know I'd do it, right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes all because of you!
You're a numb-nut!
Follow me!
It's a stickup!
Where's the money?
Where's the money?
What're you looking at?
I'm serious!
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.
The money's in here.
Let go of the girl!
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
Go away!
You're dragging me down!
Go home and raise pigs.
Go, before I kill you.
You!
Whatsyourname!
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!
- For real?
- Someone's waiting for you.
Brother Sum!
One look at you, and I knew you'd do anything.
Right!
You just needed your chance.
Damn right!
We've an assignment for you.
Anything, Brother Sum!
"Research on abnormal people." What's that?
A mental asylum.
Soldiers!
Boy Scouts!
Tanks!
No worries.
When the Boy Scouts change shifts, you have exactly five minutes.
Follow the arrows on the map.
Go to the last cell and get the man inside there out.
Here's your tools.
What about you guys?
We're your lookouts.
Five minutes.
Hurry!
The world's top killer indeed looks the part!
It's only a title.
Cut the bullshit.
We want two people killed.
Name your price.
Name my what?
I've killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary.
So far, I've never found one.
That's why I stayed inside.
Had I met my match, I'd have been out long ago.
If you find me a worthy opponent I'll do it for free.
No charge!
Do you have someone?
Yes.
Brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge.
But first, will you show us some moves?
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.
You numskulls aren't worthy!
He doesn't look the part.
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'll clean up well.
You sure you got the right guy?
Absolutely.
I swear I did exactly what you told me.
Please show us some moves, Mr. Beast.
Don't make it hard for me!
You dumb or what?
You know what this is, old man?
Ever seen a fist this big?
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!
Really?
Try me, then.
Is he okay?
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
Harder!
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun!
In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
The real masters, together in one room!
Only the world's top killer has such an aura.
Likewise.
Could you two be the fated lovers...?
Paris and Helen of Troy!
A pleasure, indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang and only the Axe Gang.
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
With the Beast here, let's see whose funeral it is!
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you or be killed by you.
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
Piece of cake.
I can handle this.
Good try, but a little off target.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
- Looks like they're not up to it!
- Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
- I'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
- Go to hell!
You!
Come over here.
- Hit him!
- Yes!
- The head!
- Of course!
- Hit him on the head!
- Okay.
- Here's your chance.
- Got it!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
- Hit the shit out of him!
- Right!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
Beat the shit out of him!
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused!
Wow, that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
No one gets away from me!
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at least he finally made good.
Look at him!
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey, wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
There's no one here!
CHINESE MEDICINE
It's a miracle he lasted this long.
The herbs should help him.
Herbal medicine can only partly help.
The key is his own body structure.
All his bones and tendons are broken.
It's amazing he's recovering so fast.
It can't be possible...
Unless he's...
What's that smell?
You mustn't smoke while you're hurt.
Let me handle this.
This makes no sense.
Who knew the Beast could clear the chi flow and thus unleash the boy's true potential?
We should've guessed.
He is the one!
Is this for real?
You're still alive, you turncoat?
Kill him, men!
What kind of move is that?
Kids' stuff!
If our son were alive, he'd be his age now.
If he studies hard, he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer.
A stuntman, more likely!
Not bad.
Let's go.
I can even stop bullets...
What?
The Toad Style of the Kwan Lun School?
Oh, no!
Remember the Palm move that falls from heaven?
That's the long lost Buddhist Palm.
I surrender!
What kind of move was that?
If you want to learn, I'll teach you.
Master!
Hey!
Tell him not to put snot on the glass.
You two, put your pants on!
No licking if you're not buying!
Kid, you have the bone structure of a kung-fu genius.
World peace is in your hands.
Here's the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
Because it's fate, I'll let you have it for $ 10.
Wait!
You want more...?
INSPECTOR CHAN
SUPER CRIME FIGHTERS
Anyone else?
Such a beautiful woman and you arrest her just for spitting?
Is there no justice?
Is there no law?
Commissioner is only your boss because he paid his dues to the Crocodile Gang.
And you don't fucking know me?
Sorry, I didn't know she was your wife.
Ugly coward!
What are you looking at?
Never seen such a handsome gang boss?
Who'd be in the film business?
It's Sunday, and the theater's deserted.
Where's the car?
Let's go back inside!
Call for help!
No need for that, Northerner.
While you were messing with the cop, your men signed up with us.
I'll kill all you Axe Gangsters!
Stop!
You forget the time I treated you to dinner.
Brother Sum.
Please...
Please spare me.
Don't worry.
I don't kill women.
You can go!
Thank you, Big Brother.
Cops!
Come clean up the mess!
THE AXE GANG
In a time of social unrest and disorder...
In a time of social unrest and disorder the gangs have moved in to consolidate their power.
The most feared of them all is the Axe Gang.
Only in the poorest districts, which hold no interest for the gangs can people live in peace.
PIG STY ALLE Y
One, two, three!
- That okay, Coolie?
- No problem!
TAILOR
NOODLES AND CONGEE
My check, please, Donut.
- How much?
- It's on the house!
Donut.
- It's nothing.
- I like you.
I'll ask the wife about lowering your rent.
Morning, Landlord!
Landlord!
Jill!
How you've grown!
Come let me examine you!
Good to see you, Landlord!
What's so good about it?
Don't...!
Can you make the skirt slit higher?
Sure!
Look, a comet!
Jane!
You naughty girl!
Landlord!
You're such a scoundrel!
Don't go, Jane!
Stay and chat!
I'm only kidding.
Jane!
Landlady!
Landlady!
What happened to the water?
Water ain't free!
You talk a lot for someone who won't pay his rent.
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.
You think that's a problem?
From now on, no water on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
I just love hearing you fools complain.
Assholes!
Good morning, Landlady!
Just pay your rent, or I'll burn your shop down.
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter, fairy!
Serves you right you're a coolie!
Months overdue and not even a "good morning."
You'll be a coolie for life.
There you go, handsome!
What took you so long with the congee?
I stopped to help an old lady cross the street.
- What are you doing here?
- Checking for Peeping Toms.
Was someone just spying on you, Auntie Six?
Don't shoot your mouth off without proof.
She's crazy.
Go away!
Please can you teach us, sir?
No more soccer!
- Who wants the cut?
- My boss.
Take a seat.
Done!
Fifty cents, please.
Isn't it great?
It's too good!
Why'd you make him look so good?
Why?
Don't get mad, boss.
He's my old buddy.
I'll handle this.
He's boss of the Axe Gang.
Don't you see the two axes?
We're bad guys.
Making him look good is really bad.
Understand?
- I didn't know.
- You're a numskull!
But I like you, so just pay me, and I'll take care of it.
No way!
Steady with the axe, boss.
Let me talk to him.
I really care for you.
You saw it for yourself.
Seriously.
Why don't you pay up.
Not much.
Enough for a drink.
Oh, so it's blackmail!
Boss!
Boss!
Now you're dead!
Looks like he's waking up!
I'm not afraid.
You can kill me.
But there'll be thousands more of me!
You want to play tough?
The Axe Gang boss is napping in there.
Whoever wants to die, step forward.
So you want to fight?
Great!
We'll go one-on-one.
Don't even think about cheating.
That old woman with the onion!
You look real tough.
Want to try me?
I'll let you hit me first.
What do you do?
I'm a farmer.
Farmers don't fight.
Piss off!
He's crazy!
Calling me names?
You're lucky you're a woman.
Hey, shorty!
Yeah, you!
If you're short, you don't retort.
What did I say about cheating?
Sit back down!
You!
The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.
No, not you.
I mean...
You!
Hey, kid, let's rumble!
All right, all right!
So no one-on-ones today.
You're all such wimps!
He blackmailed me.
Fat woman, you're in charge here, right?
Fat woman, my ass!
I'm with the Axe Gang!
Axe Gang, my ass!
Boss!
Boss, my ass!
- You have to pay our medical bills!
- Bills, my ass!
- We're on the same side!
- Same side, my ass!
Think you're so tough?
I'll call for backup!
You nitwit!
Let's see you call backup!
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.
Don't you go away!
Go put a down payment on your coffin!
Who threw the firecracker?
I'm one of you, brother.
Mind your own business!
It's raining.
Go bring in your laundry!
Fat woman!
You blackmailing me too?
I ain't afraid.
I...
Did anyone see what happened?
Don't!
My back's broken!
Call for help!
Hold on, calm down.
You hungry?
Keep quiet.
No.
Who did this?
I'll count to three.
One two...
I did it!
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?
Sorry!
Look away, kid.
Get rid of him!
We're the bad guys!
We're meant to do the ass-kicking not the other way around.
And it's all because these morons posed as Axes.
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.
We'll handle this.
You!
Take care of it.
- Boy, can this guy pick locks.
- It's a living.
Give me a break.
Pick that one too, if you're so good.
Come.
I'll count to three.
Hurry!
Ready?
Three!
That's quick!
Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will!
Go on!
Thank you, Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before, you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living!
The streets out there are filled with money and women.
You only need the will and determination to seize the opportunity to win.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone, and we're in the gang.
Then it'll be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars with no ambition.
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'll smash your glasses!
Get lost!
Come here and say that!
- You're really gonna kill someone?
- That's right!
The four-eyes, the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty.
But they're good at kung fu.
- I can do kung fu!
- Oh, yeah?
Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist Palm kung fu?
Hey there, handsome boy.
Stop.
Amazing!
Do you know you have a special aura?
You're so young, but you have the bone structure... and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.
If your chi flow can be channeled, then you will be invincible!
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.
The duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours.
Sure.
This is the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
It's priceless.
But as it's fate, I'll let you have it for $ 10.
BUDDHIST PALM MANUAL
- You gave him your life savings?
- Yes.
I was saving to study to be a doctor or lawyer but this was world peace.
Let go of the girl!
Hey!
It's the Buddhist Palm!
"The 20-Cent Kung Fu Manual."
You must be loaded.
Have you killed anyone lately?
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
I realized then that good guys never win.
I want to be bad.
I want to be the killer!
- Ice cream!
- Where?
Make mine a vanilla.
Chocolate for me!
What're you looking at?
Never seen free ice cream before?
Look at her run!
You're such kung-fu masters, go take it on the road.
You belong in the circus, not here!
Don't say that, Landlady.
There must be a reason they're here.
Everyone has his reasons.
We don't want to make trouble.
I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.
We'll never hear the end of it.
Why don't you get lost!
Your wife shouldn't be so nasty.
You okay?
Masters.
We have nothing precious to give you but take this as a token of our appreciation.
Thanks for saving us!
Stop the crying.
This isn't a show!
- You're so cold-hearted.
- Talking back to me, eh?
You may know kung fu, but you're still a fairy.
It's no crime to be good at kung fu!
Once a fairy, always a fairy.
Look at you.
What's with the red underwear?
Why not a diaper while you're at it.
What's wrong with red underwear?
Where were you when there was trouble?
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.
Be reasonable!
I'll reason with you.
You owe me three months' rent.
That's $90.
Pay up or pack up!
Don't you worry.
I'll pay it.
Think you're a smartass, Rabbit-Tooth Jane?
What's it to you, tub of lard?
Bitch!
Calm down, Landlady.
This is your fault.
- Are you trying to kill us?
- You're right.
How could you do that?
Shut the hell up!
You think you can out-yell me?
The fat lady can really sing.
Watch this!
What happened?
What do you mean, what happened?
You try it.
- Me?
- Quick!
Sorry!
You okay?
I think you should get closer and take better aim.
Okay?
Okay!
- Who's throwing the handles?
- Handle?
Where's the third knife?
God knows where it went.
Could it be the same one?
Can't be...
- Don't!
- Sorry.
What are you trying to say?
I just remembered I have something to do.
See you!
Uh-oh.
They've seen us!
Stay back!
Don't panic!
Snakes like music.
If I whistle, they won't bite.
Please, no more bright ideas.
Oh, what the hell!
Not you again, asshole!
Get back to your business!
Split up!
Split?
What're you doing here?
Looking for you.
Weren't you hurt?
I'm fine!
How come you always recover so fast?
I don't know.
- Which hospital did you go to?
- Don't remember.
Maybe it's better that way.
Memories can be painful.
To forget may be a blessing!
I never knew you were so deep.
All the sadness one can bear down the river everywhere.
Hey, get out of the way!
Move!
I'll slap you to kingdom come!
Look at those four-eyes carting around a coffin.
What morons!
Don't blame me for making you leave.
We'll let Buddha decide whether you stay or go.
HORRIFICALLY BAD FATE
Have some tea.
We're grateful for some professional help.
We understand the problem.
Twelve Kicks from the Tam School Iron Fist from the Hung School and the Hexagon Staff...
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.
Their warrior days are long over but they're still top fighters.
This job is a great challenge for us.
Now, that's professionalism.
Number One Killers.
Expensive, yes, but worth every penny!
No!
Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer.
He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
Strictly speaking, we're just musicians.
A song that wrenches the heart O where do I find a knowing ear?
Great poem, isn't it?
We'll be saying goodbye soon.
Who knows when we'll see each other again.
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a lot to pack.
You're right.
Twelve Kicks of the Tam School!
Superb attack and defense!
Iron Fist: powerful yet delicate.
Topnotch!
Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves.
Mystical!
Till we meet again!
More lipstick!
Stay there, or I'll break you in half.
Sorry, we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material!
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories...
Insulting the Axe Gang!
We'll show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good!
Don't block my view!
Damn!
I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry.
It's nothing!
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry, sorry!
Get out of my way!
Hang in there, Tailor.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the last we'll see of them.
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down!
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
People are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you I can now die in peace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.
Years ago we saw our only son killed in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters and we'll avenge them!
Becoming a top fighter takes time.
Unless you're a natural-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.
It's obvious I'm the one!
Don't think so.
Everyone!
We swore we'd never fight again.
But we broke that promise today.
For your own safety, please all leave!
In great power lies great responsibility.
There's no escaping from it.
Donut, you're hurt bad.
Rest now.
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
I know you, four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-challenged.
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?
Help me!
"Help me!
Help me!" Want to play, punks?
The Dragon Style?
The Tiger Style?
Come down here, and I'll smash your glasses.
Come on!
You know I'd do it, right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes all because of you!
You're a numb-nut!
Follow me!
It's a stickup!
Where's the money?
Where's the money?
What're you looking at?
I'm serious!
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.
The money's in here.
Let go of the girl!
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
Go away!
You're dragging me down!
Go home and raise pigs.
Go, before I kill you.
You!
Whatsyourname!
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!
- For real?
- Someone's waiting for you.
Brother Sum!
One look at you, and I knew you'd do anything.
Right!
You just needed your chance.
Damn right!
We've an assignment for you.
Anything, Brother Sum!
"Research on abnormal people." What's that?
A mental asylum.
Soldiers!
Boy Scouts!
Tanks!
No worries.
When the Boy Scouts change shifts, you have exactly five minutes.
Follow the arrows on the map.
Go to the last cell and get the man inside there out.
Here's your tools.
What about you guys?
We're your lookouts.
Five minutes.
Hurry!
The world's top killer indeed looks the part!
It's only a title.
Cut the bullshit.
We want two people killed.
Name your price.
Name my what?
I've killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary.
So far, I've never found one.
That's why I stayed inside.
Had I met my match, I'd have been out long ago.
If you find me a worthy opponent I'll do it for free.
No charge!
Do you have someone?
Yes.
Brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge.
But first, will you show us some moves?
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.
You numskulls aren't worthy!
He doesn't look the part.
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'll clean up well.
You sure you got the right guy?
Absolutely.
I swear I did exactly what you told me.
Please show us some moves, Mr. Beast.
Don't make it hard for me!
You dumb or what?
You know what this is, old man?
Ever seen a fist this big?
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!
Really?
Try me, then.
Is he okay?
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
Harder!
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun!
In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
The real masters, together in one room!
Only the world's top killer has such an aura.
Likewise.
Could you two be the fated lovers...?
Paris and Helen of Troy!
A pleasure, indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang and only the Axe Gang.
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
With the Beast here, let's see whose funeral it is!
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you or be killed by you.
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
Piece of cake.
I can handle this.
Good try, but a little off target.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
- Looks like they're not up to it!
- Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
- I'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
- Go to hell!
You!
Come over here.
- Hit him!
- Yes!
- The head!
- Of course!
- Hit him on the head!
- Okay.
- Here's your chance.
- Got it!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
- Hit the shit out of him!
- Right!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
Beat the shit out of him!
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused!
Wow, that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
No one gets away from me!
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at least he finally made good.
Look at him!
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey, wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
There's no one here!
CHINESE MEDICINE
It's a miracle he lasted this long.
The herbs should help him.
Herbal medicine can only partly help.
The key is his own body structure.
All his bones and tendons are broken.
It's amazing he's recovering so fast.
It can't be possible...
Unless he's...
What's that smell?
You mustn't smoke while you're hurt.
Let me handle this.
This makes no sense.
Who knew the Beast could clear the chi flow and thus unleash the boy's true potential?
We should've guessed.
He is the one!
Is this for real?
You're still alive, you turncoat?
Kill him, men!
What kind of move is that?
Kids' stuff!
If our son were alive, he'd be his age now.
If he studies hard, he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer.
A stuntman, more likely!
Not bad.
Let's go.
I can even stop bullets...
What?
The Toad Style of the Kwan Lun School?
Oh, no!
Remember the Palm move that falls from heaven?
That's the long lost Buddhist Palm.
I surrender!
What kind of move was that?
If you want to learn, I'll teach you.
Master!
Hey!
Tell him not to put snot on the glass.
You two, put your pants on!
No licking if you're not buying!
Kid, you have the bone structure of a kung-fu genius.
World peace is in your hands.
Here's the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
Because it's fate, I'll let you have it for $ 10.
Wait!
You want more...?
INSPECTOR CHAN
SUPER CRIME FIGHTERS
Anyone else?
Such a beautiful woman and you arrest her just for spitting?
Is there no justice?
Is there no law?
Commissioner is only your boss because he paid his dues to the Crocodile Gang.
And you don't fucking know me?
Sorry, I didn't know she was your wife.
Ugly coward!
What are you looking at?
Never seen such a handsome gang boss?
Who'd be in the film business?
It's Sunday, and the theater's deserted.
Where's the car?
Let's go back inside!
Call for help!
No need for that, Northerner.
While you were messing with the cop, your men signed up with us.
I'll kill all you Axe Gangsters!
Stop!
You forget the time I treated you to dinner.
Brother Sum.
Please...
Please spare me.
Don't worry.
I don't kill women.
You can go!
Thank you, Big Brother.
Cops!
Come clean up the mess!
THE AXE GANG
In a time of social unrest and disorder...
In a time of social unrest and disorder the gangs have moved in to consolidate their power.
The most feared of them all is the Axe Gang.
Only in the poorest districts, which hold no interest for the gangs can people live in peace.
PIG STY ALLE Y
One, two, three!
- That okay, Coolie?
- No problem!
TAILOR
NOODLES AND CONGEE
My check, please, Donut.
- How much?
- It's on the house!
Donut.
- It's nothing.
- I like you.
I'll ask the wife about lowering your rent.
Morning, Landlord!
Landlord!
Jill!
How you've grown!
Come let me examine you!
Good to see you, Landlord!
What's so good about it?
Don't...!
Can you make the skirt slit higher?
Sure!
Look, a comet!
Jane!
You naughty girl!
Landlord!
You're such a scoundrel!
Don't go, Jane!
Stay and chat!
I'm only kidding.
Jane!
Landlady!
Landlady!
What happened to the water?
Water ain't free!
You talk a lot for someone who won't pay his rent.
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.
You think that's a problem?
From now on, no water on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
I just love hearing you fools complain.
Assholes!
Good morning, Landlady!
Just pay your rent, or I'll burn your shop down.
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter, fairy!
Serves you right you're a coolie!
Months overdue and not even a "good morning."
You'll be a coolie for life.
There you go, handsome!
What took you so long with the congee?
I stopped to help an old lady cross the street.
- What are you doing here?
- Checking for Peeping Toms.
Was someone just spying on you, Auntie Six?
Don't shoot your mouth off without proof.
She's crazy.
Go away!
Please can you teach us, sir?
No more soccer!
- Who wants the cut?
- My boss.
Take a seat.
Done!
Fifty cents, please.
Isn't it great?
It's too good!
Why'd you make him look so good?
Why?
Don't get mad, boss.
He's my old buddy.
I'll handle this.
He's boss of the Axe Gang.
Don't you see the two axes?
We're bad guys.
Making him look good is really bad.
Understand?
- I didn't know.
- You're a numskull!
But I like you, so just pay me, and I'll take care of it.
No way!
Steady with the axe, boss.
Let me talk to him.
I really care for you.
You saw it for yourself.
Seriously.
Why don't you pay up.
Not much.
Enough for a drink.
Oh, so it's blackmail!
Boss!
Boss!
Now you're dead!
Looks like he's waking up!
I'm not afraid.
You can kill me.
But there'll be thousands more of me!
You want to play tough?
The Axe Gang boss is napping in there.
Whoever wants to die, step forward.
So you want to fight?
Great!
We'll go one-on-one.
Don't even think about cheating.
That old woman with the onion!
You look real tough.
Want to try me?
I'll let you hit me first.
What do you do?
I'm a farmer.
Farmers don't fight.
Piss off!
He's crazy!
Calling me names?
You're lucky you're a woman.
Hey, shorty!
Yeah, you!
If you're short, you don't retort.
What did I say about cheating?
Sit back down!
You!
The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.
No, not you.
I mean...
You!
Hey, kid, let's rumble!
All right, all right!
So no one-on-ones today.
You're all such wimps!
He blackmailed me.
Fat woman, you're in charge here, right?
Fat woman, my ass!
I'm with the Axe Gang!
Axe Gang, my ass!
Boss!
Boss, my ass!
- You have to pay our medical bills!
- Bills, my ass!
- We're on the same side!
- Same side, my ass!
Think you're so tough?
I'll call for backup!
You nitwit!
Let's see you call backup!
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.
Don't you go away!
Go put a down payment on your coffin!
Who threw the firecracker?
I'm one of you, brother.
Mind your own business!
It's raining.
Go bring in your laundry!
Fat woman!
You blackmailing me too?
I ain't afraid.
I...
Did anyone see what happened?
Don't!
My back's broken!
Call for help!
Hold on, calm down.
You hungry?
Keep quiet.
No.
Who did this?
I'll count to three.
One two...
I did it!
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?
Sorry!
Look away, kid.
Get rid of him!
We're the bad guys!
We're meant to do the ass-kicking not the other way around.
And it's all because these morons posed as Axes.
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.
We'll handle this.
You!
Take care of it.
- Boy, can this guy pick locks.
- It's a living.
Give me a break.
Pick that one too, if you're so good.
Come.
I'll count to three.
Hurry!
Ready?
Three!
That's quick!
Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will!
Go on!
Thank you, Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before, you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living!
The streets out there are filled with money and women.
You only need the will and determination to seize the opportunity to win.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone, and we're in the gang.
Then it'll be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars with no ambition.
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'll smash your glasses!
Get lost!
Come here and say that!
- You're really gonna kill someone?
- That's right!
The four-eyes, the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty.
But they're good at kung fu.
- I can do kung fu!
- Oh, yeah?
Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist Palm kung fu?
Hey there, handsome boy.
Stop.
Amazing!
Do you know you have a special aura?
You're so young, but you have the bone structure... and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.
If your chi flow can be channeled, then you will be invincible!
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.
The duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours.
Sure.
This is the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
It's priceless.
But as it's fate, I'll let you have it for $ 10.
BUDDHIST PALM MANUAL
- You gave him your life savings?
- Yes.
I was saving to study to be a doctor or lawyer but this was world peace.
Let go of the girl!
Hey!
It's the Buddhist Palm!
"The 20-Cent Kung Fu Manual."
You must be loaded.
Have you killed anyone lately?
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
I realized then that good guys never win.
I want to be bad.
I want to be the killer!
- Ice cream!
- Where?
Make mine a vanilla.
Chocolate for me!
What're you looking at?
Never seen free ice cream before?
Look at her run!
You're such kung-fu masters, go take it on the road.
You belong in the circus, not here!
Don't say that, Landlady.
There must be a reason they're here.
Everyone has his reasons.
We don't want to make trouble.
I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.
We'll never hear the end of it.
Why don't you get lost!
Your wife shouldn't be so nasty.
You okay?
Masters.
We have nothing precious to give you but take this as a token of our appreciation.
Thanks for saving us!
Stop the crying.
This isn't a show!
- You're so cold-hearted.
- Talking back to me, eh?
You may know kung fu, but you're still a fairy.
It's no crime to be good at kung fu!
Once a fairy, always a fairy.
Look at you.
What's with the red underwear?
Why not a diaper while you're at it.
What's wrong with red underwear?
Where were you when there was trouble?
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.
Be reasonable!
I'll reason with you.
You owe me three months' rent.
That's $90.
Pay up or pack up!
Don't you worry.
I'll pay it.
Think you're a smartass, Rabbit-Tooth Jane?
What's it to you, tub of lard?
Bitch!
Calm down, Landlady.
This is your fault.
- Are you trying to kill us?
- You're right.
How could you do that?
Shut the hell up!
You think you can out-yell me?
The fat lady can really sing.
Watch this!
What happened?
What do you mean, what happened?
You try it.
- Me?
- Quick!
Sorry!
You okay?
I think you should get closer and take better aim.
Okay?
Okay!
- Who's throwing the handles?
- Handle?
Where's the third knife?
God knows where it went.
Could it be the same one?
Can't be...
- Don't!
- Sorry.
What are you trying to say?
I just remembered I have something to do.
See you!
Uh-oh.
They've seen us!
Stay back!
Don't panic!
Snakes like music.
If I whistle, they won't bite.
Please, no more bright ideas.
Oh, what the hell!
Not you again, asshole!
Get back to your business!
Split up!
Split?
What're you doing here?
Looking for you.
Weren't you hurt?
I'm fine!
How come you always recover so fast?
I don't know.
- Which hospital did you go to?
- Don't remember.
Maybe it's better that way.
Memories can be painful.
To forget may be a blessing!
I never knew you were so deep.
All the sadness one can bear down the river everywhere.
Hey, get out of the way!
Move!
I'll slap you to kingdom come!
Look at those four-eyes carting around a coffin.
What morons!
Don't blame me for making you leave.
We'll let Buddha decide whether you stay or go.
HORRIFICALLY BAD FATE
Have some tea.
We're grateful for some professional help.
We understand the problem.
Twelve Kicks from the Tam School Iron Fist from the Hung School and the Hexagon Staff...
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.
Their warrior days are long over but they're still top fighters.
This job is a great challenge for us.
Now, that's professionalism.
Number One Killers.
Expensive, yes, but worth every penny!
No!
Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer.
He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
Strictly speaking, we're just musicians.
A song that wrenches the heart O where do I find a knowing ear?
Great poem, isn't it?
We'll be saying goodbye soon.
Who knows when we'll see each other again.
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a lot to pack.
You're right.
Twelve Kicks of the Tam School!
Superb attack and defense!
Iron Fist: powerful yet delicate.
Topnotch!
Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves.
Mystical!
Till we meet again!
More lipstick!
Stay there, or I'll break you in half.
Sorry, we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material!
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories...
Insulting the Axe Gang!
We'll show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good!
Don't block my view!
Damn!
I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry.
It's nothing!
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry, sorry!
Get out of my way!
Hang in there, Tailor.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the last we'll see of them.
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down!
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
People are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you I can now die in peace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.
Years ago we saw our only son killed in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters and we'll avenge them!
Becoming a top fighter takes time.
Unless you're a natural-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.
It's obvious I'm the one!
Don't think so.
Everyone!
We swore we'd never fight again.
But we broke that promise today.
For your own safety, please all leave!
In great power lies great responsibility.
There's no escaping from it.
Donut, you're hurt bad.
Rest now.
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
I know you, four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-challenged.
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?
Help me!
"Help me!
Help me!" Want to play, punks?
The Dragon Style?
The Tiger Style?
Come down here, and I'll smash your glasses.
Come on!
You know I'd do it, right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes all because of you!
You're a numb-nut!
Follow me!
It's a stickup!
Where's the money?
Where's the money?
What're you looking at?
I'm serious!
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.
The money's in here.
Let go of the girl!
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
Go away!
You're dragging me down!
Go home and raise pigs.
Go, before I kill you.
You!
Whatsyourname!
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!
- For real?
- Someone's waiting for you.
Brother Sum!
One look at you, and I knew you'd do anything.
Right!
You just needed your chance.
Damn right!
We've an assignment for you.
Anything, Brother Sum!
"Research on abnormal people." What's that?
A mental asylum.
Soldiers!
Boy Scouts!
Tanks!
No worries.
When the Boy Scouts change shifts, you have exactly five minutes.
Follow the arrows on the map.
Go to the last cell and get the man inside there out.
Here's your tools.
What about you guys?
We're your lookouts.
Five minutes.
Hurry!
The world's top killer indeed looks the part!
It's only a title.
Cut the bullshit.
We want two people killed.
Name your price.
Name my what?
I've killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary.
So far, I've never found one.
That's why I stayed inside.
Had I met my match, I'd have been out long ago.
If you find me a worthy opponent I'll do it for free.
No charge!
Do you have someone?
Yes.
Brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge.
But first, will you show us some moves?
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.
You numskulls aren't worthy!
He doesn't look the part.
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'll clean up well.
You sure you got the right guy?
Absolutely.
I swear I did exactly what you told me.
Please show us some moves, Mr. Beast.
Don't make it hard for me!
You dumb or what?
You know what this is, old man?
Ever seen a fist this big?
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!
Really?
Try me, then.
Is he okay?
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
Harder!
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun!
In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
The real masters, together in one room!
Only the world's top killer has such an aura.
Likewise.
Could you two be the fated lovers...?
Paris and Helen of Troy!
A pleasure, indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang and only the Axe Gang.
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
With the Beast here, let's see whose funeral it is!
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you or be killed by you.
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
Piece of cake.
I can handle this.
Good try, but a little off target.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
- Looks like they're not up to it!
- Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
- I'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
- Go to hell!
You!
Come over here.
- Hit him!
- Yes!
- The head!
- Of course!
- Hit him on the head!
- Okay.
- Here's your chance.
- Got it!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
- Hit the shit out of him!
- Right!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
Beat the shit out of him!
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused!
Wow, that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
No one gets away from me!
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at least he finally made good.
Look at him!
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey, wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
There's no one here!
CHINESE MEDICINE
It's a miracle he lasted this long.
The herbs should help him.
Herbal medicine can only partly help.
The key is his own body structure.
All his bones and tendons are broken.
It's amazing he's recovering so fast.
It can't be possible...
Unless he's...
What's that smell?
You mustn't smoke while you're hurt.
Let me handle this.
This makes no sense.
Who knew the Beast could clear the chi flow and thus unleash the boy's true potential?
We should've guessed.
He is the one!
Is this for real?
You're still alive, you turncoat?
Kill him, men!
What kind of move is that?
Kids' stuff!
If our son were alive, he'd be his age now.
If he studies hard, he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer.
A stuntman, more likely!
Not bad.
Let's go.
I can even stop bullets...
What?
The Toad Style of the Kwan Lun School?
Oh, no!
Remember the Palm move that falls from heaven?
That's the long lost Buddhist Palm.
I surrender!
What kind of move was that?
If you want to learn, I'll teach you.
Master!
Hey!
Tell him not to put snot on the glass.
You two, put your pants on!
No licking if you're not buying!
Kid, you have the bone structure of a kung-fu genius.
World peace is in your hands.
Here's the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
Because it's fate, I'll let you have it for $ 10.
Wait!
You want more...?

Anyone else?
Such a beautiful woman and you arrest her just for spitting?
Is there no justice?
Is there no law?
Commissioner is only your boss because he paid his dues to the Crocodile Gang.
And you don't fucking know me?
Sorry, I didn't know she was your wife.
Ugly coward!
What are you looking at?
Never seen such a handsome gang boss?
Who'd be in the film business?
It's Sunday, and the theater's deserted.
Where's the car?
Let's go back inside!
Call for help!
No need for that, Northerner.
While you were messing with the cop, your men signed up with us.
I'll kill all you Axe Gangsters!
Stop!
You forget the time I treated you to dinner.
Brother Sum.
Please...
Please spare me.
Don't worry.
I don't kill women.
You can go!
Thank you, Big Brother.
Cops!

THE AXE GANG
In a time of social unrest and disorder...
In a time of social unrest and disorder the gangs have moved in to consolidate their power.
The most feared of them all is the Axe Gang.
Only in the poorest districts, which hold no interest for the gangs can people live in peace.

- No problem!
TAILOR
NOODLES AND CONGEE
My check, please, Donut.
- How much?
- It's on the house!
Donut.
- It's nothing.
- I like you.
I'll ask the wife about lowering your rent.
Morning, Landlord!
Landlord!
Jill!
How you've grown!
Come let me examine you!
Good to see you, Landlord!
What's so good about it?
Don't...!
Can you make the skirt slit higher?
Sure!
Look, a comet!
Jane!
You naughty girl!
Landlord!
You're such a scoundrel!
Don't go, Jane!
Stay and chat!
I'm only kidding.
Jane!
Landlady!
Landlady!
What happened to the water?
Water ain't free!
You talk a lot for someone who won't pay his rent.
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.
You think that's a problem?
From now on, no water on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
I just love hearing you fools complain.
Assholes!
Good morning, Landlady!
Just pay your rent, or I'll burn your shop down.
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter, fairy!
Serves you right you're a coolie!
Months overdue and not even a "good morning."
You'll be a coolie for life.
There you go, handsome!
What took you so long with the congee?
I stopped to help an old lady cross the street.
- What are you doing here?
- Checking for Peeping Toms.
Was someone just spying on you, Auntie Six?
Don't shoot your mouth off without proof.
She's crazy.
Go away!
Please can you teach us, sir?
No more soccer!
- Who wants the cut?
- My boss.
Take a seat.
Done!
Fifty cents, please.
Isn't it great?
It's too good!
Why'd you make him look so good?
Why?
Don't get mad, boss.
He's my old buddy.
I'll handle this.
He's boss of the Axe Gang.
Don't you see the two axes?
We're bad guys.
Making him look good is really bad.
Understand?
- I didn't know.
- You're a numskull!
But I like you, so just pay me, and I'll take care of it.
No way!
Steady with the axe, boss.
Let me talk to him.
I really care for you.
You saw it for yourself.
Seriously.
Why don't you pay up.
Not much.
Enough for a drink.
Oh, so it's blackmail!
Boss!
Boss!
Now you're dead!
Looks like he's waking up!
I'm not afraid.
You can kill me.
But there'll be thousands more of me!
You want to play tough?
The Axe Gang boss is napping in there.
Whoever wants to die, step forward.
So you want to fight?
Great!
We'll go one-on-one.
Don't even think about cheating.
That old woman with the onion!
You look real tough.
Want to try me?
I'll let you hit me first.
What do you do?
I'm a farmer.
Farmers don't fight.
Piss off!
He's crazy!
Calling me names?
You're lucky you're a woman.
Hey, shorty!
Yeah, you!
If you're short, you don't retort.
What did I say about cheating?
Sit back down!
You!
The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.
No, not you.
I mean...
You!
Hey, kid, let's rumble!
All right, all right!
So no one-on-ones today.
You're all such wimps!
He blackmailed me.
Fat woman, you're in charge here, right?
Fat woman, my ass!
I'm with the Axe Gang!
Axe Gang, my ass!
Boss!
Boss, my ass!
- You have to pay our medical bills!
- Bills, my ass!
- We're on the same side!
- Same side, my ass!
Think you're so tough?
I'll call for backup!
You nitwit!
Let's see you call backup!
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.
Don't you go away!
Go put a down payment on your coffin!
Who threw the firecracker?
I'm one of you, brother.
Mind your own business!
It's raining.
Go bring in your laundry!
Fat woman!
You blackmailing me too?
I ain't afraid.
I...
Did anyone see what happened?
Don't!
My back's broken!
Call for help!
Hold on, calm down.
You hungry?
Keep quiet.
No.
Who did this?
I'll count to three.
One two...
I did it!
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?
Sorry!
Look away, kid.
Get rid of him!
We're the bad guys!
We're meant to do the ass-kicking not the other way around.
And it's all because these morons posed as Axes.
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.
We'll handle this.
You!
Take care of it.
- Boy, can this guy pick locks.
- It's a living.
Give me a break.
Pick that one too, if you're so good.
Come.
I'll count to three.
Hurry!
Ready?
Three!
That's quick!
Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will!
Go on!
Thank you, Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before, you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living!
The streets out there are filled with money and women.
You only need the will and determination to seize the opportunity to win.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone, and we're in the gang.
Then it'll be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars with no ambition.
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'll smash your glasses!
Get lost!
Come here and say that!
- You're really gonna kill someone?
- That's right!
The four-eyes, the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty.
But they're good at kung fu.
- I can do kung fu!
- Oh, yeah?
Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist Palm kung fu?
Hey there, handsome boy.
Stop.
Amazing!
Do you know you have a special aura?
You're so young, but you have the bone structure... and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.
If your chi flow can be channeled, then you will be invincible!
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.
The duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours.
Sure.
This is the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
It's priceless.
But as it's fate, I'll let you have it for $ 10.
BUDDHIST PALM MANUAL
- You gave him your life savings?
- Yes.
I was saving to study to be a doctor or lawyer but this was world peace.
Let go of the girl!
Hey!
It's the Buddhist Palm!
"The 20-Cent Kung Fu Manual."
You must be loaded.
Have you killed anyone lately?
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
I realized then that good guys never win.
I want to be bad.
I want to be the killer!
- Ice cream!
- Where?
Make mine a vanilla.
Chocolate for me!
What're you looking at?
Never seen free ice cream before?
Look at her run!
You're such kung-fu masters, go take it on the road.
You belong in the circus, not here!
Don't say that, Landlady.
There must be a reason they're here.
Everyone has his reasons.
We don't want to make trouble.
I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.
We'll never hear the end of it.
Why don't you get lost!
Your wife shouldn't be so nasty.
You okay?
Masters.
We have nothing precious to give you but take this as a token of our appreciation.
Thanks for saving us!
Stop the crying.
This isn't a show!
- You're so cold-hearted.
- Talking back to me, eh?
You may know kung fu, but you're still a fairy.
It's no crime to be good at kung fu!
Once a fairy, always a fairy.
Look at you.
What's with the red underwear?
Why not a diaper while you're at it.
What's wrong with red underwear?
Where were you when there was trouble?
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.
Be reasonable!
I'll reason with you.
You owe me three months' rent.
That's $90.
Pay up or pack up!
Don't you worry.
I'll pay it.
Think you're a smartass, Rabbit-Tooth Jane?
What's it to you, tub of lard?
Bitch!
Calm down, Landlady.
This is your fault.
- Are you trying to kill us?
- You're right.
How could you do that?
Shut the hell up!
You think you can out-yell me?
The fat lady can really sing.
Watch this!
What happened?
What do you mean, what happened?
You try it.
- Me?
- Quick!
Sorry!
You okay?
I think you should get closer and take better aim.
Okay?
Okay!
- Who's throwing the handles?
- Handle?
Where's the third knife?
God knows where it went.
Could it be the same one?
Can't be...
- Don't!
- Sorry.
What are you trying to say?
I just remembered I have something to do.
See you!
Uh-oh.
They've seen us!
Stay back!
Don't panic!
Snakes like music.
If I whistle, they won't bite.
Please, no more bright ideas.
Oh, what the hell!
Not you again, asshole!
Get back to your business!
Split up!
Split?
What're you doing here?
Looking for you.
Weren't you hurt?
I'm fine!
How come you always recover so fast?
I don't know.
- Which hospital did you go to?
- Don't remember.
Maybe it's better that way.
Memories can be painful.
To forget may be a blessing!
I never knew you were so deep.
All the sadness one can bear down the river everywhere.
Hey, get out of the way!
Move!
I'll slap you to kingdom come!
Look at those four-eyes carting around a coffin.
What morons!
Don't blame me for making you leave.
We'll let Buddha decide whether you stay or go.
HORRIFICALLY BAD FATE
Have some tea.
We're grateful for some professional help.
We understand the problem.
Twelve Kicks from the Tam School Iron Fist from the Hung School and the Hexagon Staff...
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.
Their warrior days are long over but they're still top fighters.
This job is a great challenge for us.
Now, that's professionalism.
Number One Killers.
Expensive, yes, but worth every penny!
No!
Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer.
He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
Strictly speaking, we're just musicians.
A song that wrenches the heart O where do I find a knowing ear?
Great poem, isn't it?
We'll be saying goodbye soon.
Who knows when we'll see each other again.
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a lot to pack.
You're right.
Twelve Kicks of the Tam School!
Superb attack and defense!
Iron Fist:
Powerful yet delicate.
Topnotch!
Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves.
Mystical!
Till we meet again!
More lipstick!
Stay there, or I'll break you in half.
Sorry, we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material!
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories...
Insulting the Axe Gang!
We'll show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good!
Don't block my view!
Damn!
I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry.
It's nothing!
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry, sorry!
Get out of my way!
Hang in there, Tailor.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the last we'll see of them.
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down!
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
People are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you I can now die in peace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.
Years ago we saw our only son killed in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters and we'll avenge them!
Becoming a top fighter takes time.
Unless you're a natural-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.
It's obvious I'm the one!
Don't think so.
Everyone!
We swore we'd never fight again.
But we broke that promise today.
For your own safety, please all leave!
In great power lies great responsibility.
There's no escaping from it.
Donut, you're hurt bad.
Rest now.
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
I know you, four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-challenged.
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?
Help me!
"Help me!
Help me!" Want to play, punks?
The Dragon Style?
The Tiger Style?
Come down here, and I'll smash your glasses.
Come on!
You know I'd do it, right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes all because of you!
You're a numb-nut!
Follow me!
It's a stickup!
Where's the money?
Where's the money?
What're you looking at?
I'm serious!
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.
The money's in here.
Let go of the girl!
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
Go away!
You're dragging me down!
Go home and raise pigs.
Go, before I kill you.
You!
Whatsyourname!
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!
- For real?
- Someone's waiting for you.
Brother Sum!
One look at you, and I knew you'd do anything.
Right!
You just needed your chance.
Damn right!
We've an assignment for you.
Anything, Brother Sum!
"Research on abnormal people." What's that?
A mental asylum.
Soldiers!
Boy Scouts!
Tanks!
No worries.
When the Boy Scouts change shifts, you have exactly five minutes.
Follow the arrows on the map.
Go to the last cell and get the man inside there out.
Here's your tools.
What about you guys?
We're your lookouts.
Five minutes.
Hurry!
The world's top killer indeed looks the part!
It's only a title.
Cut the bullshit.
We want two people killed.
Name your price.
Name my what?
I've killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary.
So far, I've never found one.
That's why I stayed inside.
Had I met my match, I'd have been out long ago.
If you find me a worthy opponent I'll do it for free.
No charge!
Do you have someone?
Yes.
Brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge.
But first, will you show us some moves?
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.
You numskulls aren't worthy!
He doesn't look the part.
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'll clean up well.
You sure you got the right guy?
Absolutely.
I swear I did exactly what you told me.
Please show us some moves, Mr. Beast.
Don't make it hard for me!
You dumb or what?
You know what this is, old man?
Ever seen a fist this big?
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!
Really?
Try me, then.
Is he okay?
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
Harder!
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun!
In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
The real masters, together in one room!
Only the world's top killer has such an aura.
Likewise.
Could you two be the fated lovers...?
Paris and Helen of Troy!
A pleasure, indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang and only the Axe Gang.
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
With the Beast here, let's see whose funeral it is!
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you or be killed by you.
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
Piece of cake.
I can handle this.
Good try, but a little off target.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
- Looks like they're not up to it!
- Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
- I'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
- Go to hell!
You!
Come over here.
- Hit him!
- Yes!
- The head!
- Of course!
- Hit him on the head!
- Okay.
- Here's your chance.
- Got it!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
- Hit the shit out of him!
- Right!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
Beat the shit out of him!
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused!
Wow, that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
No one gets away from me!
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at least he finally made good.
Look at him!
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey, wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
There's no one here!
CHINESE MEDICINE

Kids' stuff!

You talk a lot for someone who won't pay his rent.
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.
You think that's a problem?
From now on, no water on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
I just love hearing you fools complain.
Assholes!
Good morning, Landlady!
Just pay your rent, or I'll burn your shop down.
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter, fairy!
Serves you right you're a coolie!
Months overdue and not even a "good morning."
You'll be a coolie for life.
There you go, handsome!
What took you so long with the congee?
I stopped to help an old lady cross the street.
- What are you doing here?
- Checking for Peeping Toms.
Was someone just spying on you, Auntie Six?
Don't shoot your mouth off without proof.
She's crazy.
Go away!
Please can you teach us, sir?
No more soccer!
- Who wants the cut?
- My boss.
Take a seat.
Done!
Fifty cents, please.
Isn't it great?
It's too good!
Why'd you make him look so good?
Why?
Don't get mad, boss.
He's my old buddy.
I'll handle this.
He's boss of the Axe Gang.
Don't you see the two axes?
We're bad guys.
Making him look good is really bad.
Understand?
- I didn't know.
- You're a numskull!
But I like you, so just pay me, and I'll take care of it.
No way!
Steady with the axe, boss.
Let me talk to him.
I really care for you.
You saw it for yourself.
Seriously.
Why don't you pay up.
Not much.
Enough for a drink.
Oh, so it's blackmail!
Boss!
Boss!
Now you're dead!
Looks like he's waking up!
I'm not afraid.
You can kill me.
But there'll be thousands more of me!
You want to play tough?
The Axe Gang boss is napping in there.
Whoever wants to die, step forward.
So you want to fight?
Great!
We'll go one-on-one.
Don't even think about cheating.
That old woman with the onion!
You look real tough.
Want to try me?
I'll let you hit me first.
What do you do?
I'm a farmer.
Farmers don't fight.
Piss off!
He's crazy!
Calling me names?
You're lucky you're a woman.
Hey, shorty!
Yeah, you!
If you're short, you don't retort.
What did I say about cheating?
Sit back down!
You!
The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.
No, not you.
I mean...
You!
Hey, kid, let's rumble!
All right, all right!
So no one-on-ones today.
You're all such wimps!
He blackmailed me.
Fat woman, you're in charge here, right?
Fat woman, my ass!
I'm with the Axe Gang!
Axe Gang, my ass!
Boss!
Boss, my ass!
- You have to pay our medical bills!
- Bills, my ass!
- We're on the same side!
- Same side, my ass!
Think you're so tough?
I'll call for backup!
You nitwit!
Let's see you call backup!
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.
Don't you go away!
Go put a down payment on your coffin!
Who threw the firecracker?
I'm one of you, brother.
Mind your own business!
It's raining.
Go bring in your laundry!
Fat woman!
You blackmailing me too?
I ain't afraid.
I...
Did anyone see what happened?
Don't!
My back's broken!
Call for help!
Hold on, calm down.
You hungry?
Keep quiet.
No.
Who did this?
I'll count to three.
One two...
I did it!
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?
Sorry!
Look away, kid.
Get rid of him!
We're the bad guys!
We're meant to do the ass-kicking not the other way around.
And it's all because these morons posed as Axes.
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.
We'll handle this.
You!
Take care of it.
- Boy, can this guy pick locks.
- It's a living.
Give me a break.
Pick that one too, if you're so good.
Come.
I'll count to three.
Hurry!
Ready?
Three!
That's quick!
Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will!
Go on!
Thank you, Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before, you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living!
The streets out there are filled with money and women.
You only need the will and determination to seize the opportunity to win.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone, and we're in the gang.
Then it'll be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars with no ambition.
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'll smash your glasses!
Get lost!
Come here and say that!
- You're really gonna kill someone?
- That's right!
The four-eyes, the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty.
But they're good at kung fu.
- I can do kung fu!
- Oh, yeah?
Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist Palm kung fu?
Hey there, handsome boy.
Stop.
Amazing!
Do you know you have a special aura?
You're so young, but you have the bone structure... and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.
If your chi flow can be channeled, then you will be invincible!
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.
The duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours.
Sure.
This is the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
It's priceless.
But as it's fate, I'll let you have it for $ 10.
BUDDHIST PALM MANUAL
- You gave him your life savings?
- Yes.
I was saving to study to be a doctor or lawyer but this was world peace.
Let go of the girl!
Hey!
It's the Buddhist Palm!
"The 20-Cent Kung Fu Manual."
You must be loaded.
Have you killed anyone lately?
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
I realized then that good guys never win.
I want to be bad.
I want to be the killer!
- Ice cream!
- Where?
Make mine a vanilla.
Chocolate for me!
What're you looking at?
Never seen free ice cream before?
Look at her run!
You're such kung-fu masters, go take it on the road.
You belong in the circus, not here!
Don't say that, Landlady.
There must be a reason they're here.
Everyone has his reasons.
We don't want to make trouble.
I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.
We'll never hear the end of it.
Why don't you get lost!
Your wife shouldn't be so nasty.
You okay?
Masters.
We have nothing precious to give you but take this as a token of our appreciation.
Thanks for saving us!
Stop the crying.
This isn't a show!
- You're so cold-hearted.
- Talking back to me, eh?
You may know kung fu, but you're still a fairy.
It's no crime to be good at kung fu!
Once a fairy, always a fairy.
Look at you.
What's with the red underwear?
Why not a diaper while you're at it.
What's wrong with red underwear?
Where were you when there was trouble?
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.
Be reasonable!
I'll reason with you.
You owe me three months' rent.
That's $90.
Pay up or pack up!
Don't you worry.
I'll pay it.
Think you're a smartass, Rabbit-Tooth Jane?
What's it to you, tub of lard?
Bitch!
Calm down, Landlady.
This is your fault.
- Are you trying to kill us?
- You're right.
How could you do that?
Shut the hell up!
You think you can out-yell me?
The fat lady can really sing.
Watch this!
What happened?
What do you mean, what happened?
You try it.
- Me?
- Quick!
Sorry!
You okay?
I think you should get closer and take better aim.
Okay?
Okay!
- Who's throwing the handles?
- Handle?
Where's the third knife?
God knows where it went.
Could it be the same one?
Can't be...
- Don't!
- Sorry.
What are you trying to say?
I just remembered I have something to do.
See you!
Uh-oh.
They've seen us!
Stay back!
Don't panic!
Snakes like music.
If I whistle, they won't bite.
Please, no more bright ideas.
Oh, what the hell!
Not you again, asshole!
Get back to your business!
Split up!
Split?
What're you doing here?
Looking for you.
Weren't you hurt?
I'm fine!
How come you always recover so fast?
I don't know.
- Which hospital did you go to?
- Don't remember.
Maybe it's better that way.
Memories can be painful.
To forget may be a blessing!
I never knew you were so deep.
All the sadness one can bear down the river everywhere.
Hey, get out of the way!
Move!
I'll slap you to kingdom come!
Look at those four-eyes carting around a coffin.
What morons!
Don't blame me for making you leave.
We'll let Buddha decide whether you stay or go.
HORRIFICALLY BAD FATE
Have some tea.
We're grateful for some professional help.
We understand the problem.
Twelve Kicks from the Tam School Iron Fist from the Hung School and the Hexagon Staff...
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.
Their warrior days are long over but they're still top fighters.
This job is a great challenge for us.
Now, that's professionalism.
Number One Killers.
Expensive, yes, but worth every penny!
No!
Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer.
He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
Strictly speaking, we're just musicians.
A song that wrenches the heart O where do I find a knowing ear?
Great poem, isn't it?
We'll be saying goodbye soon.
Who knows when we'll see each other again.
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a lot to pack.
You're right.
Twelve Kicks of the Tam School!
Superb attack and defense!
Iron Fist: powerful yet delicate.
Topnotch!
Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves.
Mystical!
Till we meet again!
More lipstick!
Stay there, or I'll break you in half.
Sorry, we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material!
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories...
Insulting the Axe Gang!
We'll show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good!
Don't block my view!
Damn!
I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry.
It's nothing!
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry, sorry!
Get out of my way!
Hang in there, Tailor.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the last we'll see of them.
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down!
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
People are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you I can now die in peace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.
Years ago we saw our only son killed in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters and we'll avenge them!
Becoming a top fighter takes time.
Unless you're a natural-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.
It's obvious I'm the one!
Don't think so.
Everyone!
We swore we'd never fight again.
But we broke that promise today.
For your own safety, please all leave!
In great power lies great responsibility.
There's no escaping from it.
Donut, you're hurt bad.
Rest now.
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
I know you, four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-challenged.
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?
Help me!
"Help me!
Help me!" Want to play, punks?
The Dragon Style?
The Tiger Style?
Come down here, and I'll smash your glasses.
Come on!
You know I'd do it, right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes all because of you!
You're a numb-nut!
Follow me!
It's a stickup!
Where's the money?
Where's the money?
What're you looking at?
I'm serious!
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.
The money's in here.
Let go of the girl!
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
Go away!
You're dragging me down!
Go home and raise pigs.
Go, before I kill you.
You!
Whatsyourname!
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!
- For real?
- Someone's waiting for you.
Brother Sum!
One look at you, and I knew you'd do anything.
Right!
You just needed your chance.
Damn right!
We've an assignment for you.
Anything, Brother Sum!
"Research on abnormal people." What's that?
A mental asylum.
Soldiers!
Boy Scouts!
Tanks!
No worries.
When the Boy Scouts change shifts, you have exactly five minutes.
Follow the arrows on the map.
Go to the last cell and get the man inside there out.
Here's your tools.
What about you guys?
We're your lookouts.
Five minutes.
Hurry!
The world's top killer indeed looks the part!
It's only a title.
Cut the bullshit.
We want two people killed.
Name your price.
Name my what?
I've killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary.
So far, I've never found one.
That's why I stayed inside.
Had I met my match, I'd have been out long ago.
If you find me a worthy opponent I'll do it for free.
No charge!
Do you have someone?
Yes.
Brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge.
But first, will you show us some moves?
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.
You numskulls aren't worthy!
He doesn't look the part.
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'll clean up well.
You sure you got the right guy?
Absolutely.
I swear I did exactly what you told me.
Please show us some moves, Mr. Beast.
Don't make it hard for me!
You dumb or what?
You know what this is, old man?
Ever seen a fist this big?
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!
Really?
Try me, then.
Is he okay?
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
Harder!
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun!
In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
The real masters, together in one room!
Only the world's top killer has such an aura.
Likewise.
Could you two be the fated lovers...?
Paris and Helen of Troy!
A pleasure, indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang and only the Axe Gang.
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
With the Beast here, let's see whose funeral it is!
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you or be killed by you.
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
Piece of cake.
I can handle this.
Good try, but a little off target.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
- Looks like they're not up to it!
- Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
- I'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
- Go to hell!
You!
Come over here.
- Hit him!
- Yes!
- The head!
- Of course!
- Hit him on the head!
- Okay.
- Here's your chance.
- Got it!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
- Hit the shit out of him!
- Right!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
Beat the shit out of him!
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused!
Wow, that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
No one gets away from me!
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at least he finally made good.
Look at him!
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey, wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
There's no one here!
CHINESE MEDICINE
It's a miracle he lasted this long.
The herbs should help him.
Herbal medicine can only partly help.
The key is his own body structure.
All his bones and tendons are broken.
It's amazing he's recovering so fast.
It can't be possible...
Unless he's...
What's that smell?
You mustn't smoke while you're hurt.
Let me handle this.
This makes no sense.
Who knew the Beast could clear the chi flow and thus unleash the boy's true potential?
We should've guessed.
He is the one!
Is this for real?
You're still alive, you turncoat?
Kill him, men!
What kind of move is that?
Kids' stuff!
If our son were alive, he'd be his age now.
If he studies hard, he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer.
A stuntman, more likely!
Not bad.
Let's go.
I can even stop bullets...
What?
The Toad Style of the Kwan Lun School?
Oh, no!
Remember the Palm move that falls from heaven?
That's the long lost Buddhist Palm.
I surrender!
What kind of move was that?
If you want to learn, I'll teach you.
Master!
Hey!
Tell him not to put snot on the glass.
You two, put your pants on!
No licking if you're not buying!
Kid, you have the bone structure of a kung-fu genius.
World peace is in your hands.
Here's the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
Because it's fate, I'll let you have it for $ 10.
Wait!
You want more...?
INSPECTOR CHAN
SUPER CRIME FIGHTERS
Anyone else?
Such a beautiful woman and you arrest her just for spitting?
Is there no justice?
Is there no law?
Commissioner is only your boss because he paid his dues to the Crocodile Gang.
And you don't fucking know me?
Sorry, I didn't know she was your wife.
Ugly coward!
What are you looking at?
Never seen such a handsome gang boss?
Who'd be in the film business?
It's Sunday, and the theater's deserted.
Where's the car?
Let's go back inside!
Call for help!
No need for that, Northerner.
While you were messing with the cop, your men signed up with us.
I'll kill all you Axe Gangsters!
Stop!
You forget the time I treated you to dinner.
Brother Sum.
Please...
Please spare me.
Don't worry.
I don't kill women.
You can go!
Thank you, Big Brother.
Cops!
Come clean up the mess!
THE AXE GANG
In a time of social unrest and disorder...
In a time of social unrest and disorder the gangs have moved in to consolidate their power.
The most feared of them all is the Axe Gang.
Only in the poorest districts, which hold no interest for the gangs can people live in peace.
PIG STY ALLE Y
One, two, three!
- That okay, Coolie?
- No problem!
TAILOR
NOODLES AND CONGEE
My check, please, Donut.
- How much?
- It's on the house!
Donut.
- It's nothing.
- I like you.
I'll ask the wife about lowering your rent.
Morning, Landlord!
Landlord!
Jill!
How you've grown!
Come let me examine you!
Good to see you, Landlord!
What's so good about it?
Don't...!
Can you make the skirt slit higher?
Sure!
Look, a comet!
Jane!
You naughty girl!
Landlord!
You're such a scoundrel!
Don't go, Jane!
Stay and chat!
I'm only kidding.
Jane!
Landlady!
Landlady!
What happened to the water?
Water ain't free!
You talk a lot for someone who won't pay his rent.
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.
You think that's a problem?
From now on, no water on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
I just love hearing you fools complain.
Assholes!
Good morning, Landlady!
Just pay your rent, or I'll burn your shop down.
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter, fairy!
Serves you right you're a coolie!
Months overdue and not even a "good morning."
You'll be a coolie for life.
There you go, handsome!
What took you so long with the congee?
I stopped to help an old lady cross the street.
- What are you doing here?
- Checking for Peeping Toms.
Was someone just spying on you, Auntie Six?
Don't shoot your mouth off without proof.
She's crazy.
Go away!
Please can you teach us, sir?
No more soccer!
- Who wants the cut?
- My boss.
Take a seat.
Done!
Fifty cents, please.
Isn't it great?
It's too good!
Why'd you make him look so good?
Why?
Don't get mad, boss.
He's my old buddy.
I'll handle this.
He's boss of the Axe Gang.
Don't you see the two axes?
We're bad guys.
Making him look good is really bad.
Understand?
- I didn't know.
- You're a numskull!
But I like you, so just pay me, and I'll take care of it.
No way!
Steady with the axe, boss.
Let me talk to him.
I really care for you.
You saw it for yourself.
Seriously.
Why don't you pay up.
Not much.
Enough for a drink.
Oh, so it's blackmail!
Boss!
Boss!
Now you're dead!
Looks like he's waking up!
I'm not afraid.
You can kill me.
But there'll be thousands more of me!
You want to play tough?
The Axe Gang boss is napping in there.
Whoever wants to die, step forward.
So you want to fight?
Great!
We'll go one-on-one.
Don't even think about cheating.
That old woman with the onion!
You look real tough.
Want to try me?
I'll let you hit me first.
What do you do?
I'm a farmer.
Farmers don't fight.
Piss off!
He's crazy!
Calling me names?
You're lucky you're a woman.
Hey, shorty!
Yeah, you!
If you're short, you don't retort.
What did I say about cheating?
Sit back down!
You!
The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.
No, not you.
I mean...
You!
Hey, kid, let's rumble!
All right, all right!
So no one-on-ones today.
You're all such wimps!
He blackmailed me.
Fat woman, you're in charge here, right?
Fat woman, my ass!
I'm with the Axe Gang!
Axe Gang, my ass!
Boss!
Boss, my ass!
- You have to pay our medical bills!
- Bills, my ass!
- We're on the same side!
- Same side, my ass!
Think you're so tough?
I'll call for backup!
You nitwit!
Let's see you call backup!
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.
Don't you go away!
Go put a down payment on your coffin!
Who threw the firecracker?
I'm one of you, brother.
Mind your own business!
It's raining.
Go bring in your laundry!
Fat woman!
You blackmailing me too?
I ain't afraid.
I...
Did anyone see what happened?
Don't!
My back's broken!
Call for help!
Hold on, calm down.
You hungry?
Keep quiet.
No.
Who did this?
I'll count to three.
One two...
I did it!
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?
Sorry!
Look away, kid.
Get rid of him!
We're the bad guys!
We're meant to do the ass-kicking not the other way around.
And it's all because these morons posed as Axes.
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.
We'll handle this.
You!
Take care of it.
- Boy, can this guy pick locks.
- It's a living.
Give me a break.
Pick that one too, if you're so good.
Come.
I'll count to three.
Hurry!
Ready?
Three!
That's quick!
Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will!
Go on!
Thank you, Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before, you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living!
The streets out there are filled with money and women.
You only need the will and determination to seize the opportunity to win.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone, and we're in the gang.
Then it'll be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars with no ambition.
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'll smash your glasses!
Get lost!
Come here and say that!
- You're really gonna kill someone?
- That's right!
The four-eyes, the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty.
But they're good at kung fu.
- I can do kung fu!
- Oh, yeah?
Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist Palm kung fu?
Hey there, handsome boy.
Stop.
Amazing!
Do you know you have a special aura?
You're so young, but you have the bone structure... and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.
If your chi flow can be channeled, then you will be invincible!
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.
The duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours.
Sure.
This is the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
It's priceless.
But as it's fate, I'll let you have it for $ 10.
BUDDHIST PALM MANUAL
- You gave him your life savings?
- Yes.
I was saving to study to be a doctor or lawyer but this was world peace.
Let go of the girl!
Hey!
It's the Buddhist Palm!
"The 20-Cent Kung Fu Manual."
You must be loaded.
Have you killed anyone lately?
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
I realized then that good guys never win.
I want to be bad.
I want to be the killer!
- Ice cream!
- Where?
Make mine a vanilla.
Chocolate for me!
What're you looking at?
Never seen free ice cream before?
Look at her run!
You're such kung-fu masters, go take it on the road.
You belong in the circus, not here!
Don't say that, Landlady.
There must be a reason they're here.
Everyone has his reasons.
We don't want to make trouble.
I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.
We'll never hear the end of it.
Why don't you get lost!
Your wife shouldn't be so nasty.
You okay?
Masters.
We have nothing precious to give you but take this as a token of our appreciation.
Thanks for saving us!
Stop the crying.
This isn't a show!
- You're so cold-hearted.
- Talking back to me, eh?
You may know kung fu, but you're still a fairy.
It's no crime to be good at kung fu!
Once a fairy, always a fairy.
Look at you.
What's with the red underwear?
Why not a diaper while you're at it.
What's wrong with red underwear?
Where were you when there was trouble?
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.
Be reasonable!
I'll reason with you.
You owe me three months' rent.
That's $90.
Pay up or pack up!
Don't you worry.
I'll pay it.
Think you're a smartass, Rabbit-Tooth Jane?
What's it to you, tub of lard?
Bitch!
Calm down, Landlady.
This is your fault.
- Are you trying to kill us?
- You're right.
How could you do that?
Shut the hell up!
You think you can out-yell me?
The fat lady can really sing.
Watch this!
What happened?
What do you mean, what happened?
You try it.
- Me?
- Quick!
Sorry!
You okay?
I think you should get closer and take better aim.
Okay?
Okay!
- Who's throwing the handles?
- Handle?
Where's the third knife?
God knows where it went.
Could it be the same one?
Can't be...
- Don't!
- Sorry.
What are you trying to say?
I just remembered I have something to do.
See you!
Uh-oh.
They've seen us!
Stay back!
Don't panic!
Snakes like music.
If I whistle, they won't bite.
Please, no more bright ideas.
Oh, what the hell!
Not you again, asshole!
Get back to your business!
Split up!
Split?
What're you doing here?
Looking for you.
Weren't you hurt?
I'm fine!
How come you always recover so fast?
I don't know.
- Which hospital did you go to?
- Don't remember.
Maybe it's better that way.
Memories can be painful.
To forget may be a blessing!
I never knew you were so deep.
All the sadness one can bear down the river everywhere.
Hey, get out of the way!
Move!
I'll slap you to kingdom come!
Look at those four-eyes carting around a coffin.
What morons!
Don't blame me for making you leave.
We'll let Buddha decide whether you stay or go.
HORRIFICALLY BAD FATE
Have some tea.
We're grateful for some professional help.
We understand the problem.
Twelve Kicks from the Tam School Iron Fist from the Hung School and the Hexagon Staff...
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.
Their warrior days are long over but they're still top fighters.
This job is a great challenge for us.
Now, that's professionalism.
Number One Killers.
Expensive, yes, but worth every penny!
No!
Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer.
He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
Strictly speaking, we're just musicians.
A song that wrenches the heart O where do I find a knowing ear?
Great poem, isn't it?
We'll be saying goodbye soon.
Who knows when we'll see each other again.
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a lot to pack.
You're right.
Twelve Kicks of the Tam School!
Superb attack and defense!
Iron Fist:
Powerful yet delicate.
Topnotch!
Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves.
Mystical!
Till we meet again!
More lipstick!
Stay there, or I'll break you in half.
Sorry, we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material!
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories...
Insulting the Axe Gang!
We'll show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good!
Don't block my view!
Damn!
I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry.
It's nothing!
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry, sorry!
Get out of my way!
Hang in there, Tailor.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the last we'll see of them.
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down!
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
People are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you I can now die in peace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.
Years ago we saw our only son killed in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters and we'll avenge them!
Becoming a top fighter takes time.
Unless you're a natural-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.
It's obvious I'm the one!
Don't think so.
Everyone!
We swore we'd never fight again.
But we broke that promise today.
For your own safety, please all leave!
In great power lies great responsibility.
There's no escaping from it.
Donut, you're hurt bad.
Rest now.
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
I know you, four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-challenged.
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?
Help me!
"Help me!
Help me!" Want to play, punks?
The Dragon Style?
The Tiger Style?
Come down here, and I'll smash your glasses.
Come on!
You know I'd do it, right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes all because of you!
You're a numb-nut!
Follow me!
It's a stickup!
Where's the money?
Where's the money?
What're you looking at?
I'm serious!
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.
The money's in here.
Let go of the girl!
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
Go away!
You're dragging me down!
Go home and raise pigs.
Go, before I kill you.
You!
Whatsyourname!
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!
- For real?
- Someone's waiting for you.
Brother Sum!
One look at you, and I knew you'd do anything.
Right!
You just needed your chance.
Damn right!
We've an assignment for you.
Anything, Brother Sum!
"Research on abnormal people." What's that?
A mental asylum.
Soldiers!
Boy Scouts!
Tanks!
No worries.
When the Boy Scouts change shifts, you have exactly five minutes.
Follow the arrows on the map.
Go to the last cell and get the man inside there out.
Here's your tools.
What about you guys?
We're your lookouts.
Five minutes.
Hurry!
The world's top killer indeed looks the part!
It's only a title.
Cut the bullshit.
We want two people killed.
Name your price.
Name my what?
I've killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary.
So far, I've never found one.
That's why I stayed inside.
Had I met my match, I'd have been out long ago.
If you find me a worthy opponent I'll do it for free.
No charge!
Do you have someone?
Yes.
Brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge.
But first, will you show us some moves?
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.
You numskulls aren't worthy!
He doesn't look the part.
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'll clean up well.
You sure you got the right guy?
Absolutely.
I swear I did exactly what you told me.
Please show us some moves, Mr. Beast.
Don't make it hard for me!
You dumb or what?
You know what this is, old man?
Ever seen a fist this big?
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!
Really?
Try me, then.
Is he okay?
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
Harder!
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun!
In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
The real masters, together in one room!
Only the world's top killer has such an aura.
Likewise.
Could you two be the fated lovers...?
Paris and Helen of Troy!
A pleasure, indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang and only the Axe Gang.
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
With the Beast here, let's see whose funeral it is!
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you or be killed by you.
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
Piece of cake.
I can handle this.
Good try, but a little off target.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
- Looks like they're not up to it!
- Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
- I'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
- Go to hell!
You!
Come over here.
- Hit him!
- Yes!
- The head!
- Of course!
- Hit him on the head!
- Okay.
- Here's your chance.
- Got it!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
- Hit the shit out of him!
- Right!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
Beat the shit out of him!
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused!
Wow, that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
No one gets away from me!
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at least he finally made good.
Look at him!
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey, wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
There's no one here!
CHINESE MEDICINE
It's a miracle he lasted this long.
The herbs should help him.
Herbal medicine can only partly help.
The key is his own body structure.
All his bones and tendons are broken.
It's amazing he's recovering so fast.
It can't be possible...
Unless he's...
What's that smell?
You mustn't smoke while you're hurt.
Let me handle this.
This makes no sense.
Who knew the Beast could clear the chi flow and thus unleash the boy's true potential?
We should've guessed.
He is the one!
Is this for real?
You're still alive, you turncoat?
Kill him, men!
What kind of move is that?
Kids' stuff!
If our son were alive, he'd be his age now.
If he studies hard, he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer.
A stuntman, more likely!
Not bad.
Let's go.
I can even stop bullets...
What?
The Toad Style of the Kwan Lun School?
Oh, no!
Remember the Palm move that falls from heaven?
That's the long lost Buddhist Palm.
I surrender!
What kind of move was that?
If you want to learn, I'll teach you.
Master!
Hey!
Tell him not to put snot on the glass.
You two, put your pants on!
No licking if you're not buying!
Kid, you have the bone structure of a kung-fu genius.
World peace is in your hands.
Here's the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
Because it's fate, I'll let you have it for $ 10.
Wait!
You want more...?
INSPECTOR CHAN
SUPER CRIME FIGHTERS
Anyone else?
Such a beautiful woman and you arrest her just for spitting?
Is there no justice?
Is there no law?
Commissioner is only your boss because he paid his dues to the Crocodile Gang.
And you don't fucking know me?
Sorry, I didn't know she was your wife.
Ugly coward!
What are you looking at?
Never seen such a handsome gang boss?
Who'd be in the film business?
It's Sunday, and the theater's deserted.
Where's the car?
Let's go back inside!
Call for help!
No need for that, Northerner.
While you were messing with the cop, your men signed up with us.
I'll kill all you Axe Gangsters!
Stop!
You forget the time I treated you to dinner.
Brother Sum.
Please...
Please spare me.
Don't worry.
I don't kill women.
You can go!
Thank you, Big Brother.
Cops!
Come clean up the mess!
THE AXE GANG
In a time of social unrest and disorder the gangs have moved in to consolidate their power.
The most feared of them all is the Axe Gang.
Only in the poorest districts, which hold no interest for the gangs can people live in peace.
PIG STY ALLE Y
One, two, three!
- That okay, Coolie?
- No problem!
TAILOR
NOODLES AND CONGEE
My check, please, Donut.
- How much?
- It's on the house!
Donut.
- It's nothing.
- I like you.
I'll ask the wife about lowering your rent.
Morning, Landlord!
Landlord!
Jill!
How you've grown!
Come let me examine you!
Good to see you, Landlord!
What's so good about it?
Don't...!
Can you make the skirt slit higher?
Sure!
Look, a comet!
Jane!
You naughty girl!
Landlord!
You're such a scoundrel!
Don't go, Jane!
Stay and chat!
I'm only kidding.
Jane!
Landlady!
Landlady!
What happened to the water?
Water ain't free!
You talk a lot for someone who won't pay his rent.
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.
You think that's a problem?
From now on, no water on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
I just love hearing you fools complain.
Assholes!
Good morning, Landlady!
Just pay your rent, or I'll burn your shop down.
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter, fairy!
Serves you right you're a coolie!
Months overdue and not even a "good morning. "
You'll be a coolie for life.
There you go, handsome!
What took you so long with the congee?
I stopped to help an old lady cross the street.
- What are you doing here?
- Checking for Peeping Toms.
Was someone just spying on you, Auntie Six?
Don't shoot your mouth off without proof.
She's crazy.
Go away!
Please can you teach us, sir?
No more soccer!
- Who wants the cut?
- My boss.
Take a seat.
Done!
Fifty cents, please.
Isn't it great?
It's too good!
Why'd you make him look so good?
Why?
Don't get mad, boss.
He's my old buddy.
I'll handle this.
He's boss of the Axe Gang.
Don't you see the two axes?
We're bad guys.
Making him look good is really bad.
Understand?
- I didn't know.
- You're a numskull!
But I like you, so just pay me, and I'll take care of it.
No way!
Steady with the axe, boss.
Let me talk to him.
I really care for you.
You saw it for yourself.
Seriously.
Why don't you pay up.
Not much.
Enough for a drink.
Oh, so it's blackmail!
Boss!
Boss!
Now you're dead!
Looks like he's waking up!
I'm not afraid.
You can kill me.
But there'll be thousands more of me!
You want to play tough?
The Axe Gang boss is napping in there.
Whoever wants to die, step forward.
So you want to fight?
Great!
We'll go one-on-one.
Don't even think about cheating.
That old woman with the onion!
You look real tough.
Want to try me?
I'll let you hit me first.
What do you do?
I'm a farmer.
Farmers don't fight.
Piss off!
He's crazy!
Calling me names?
You're lucky you're a woman.
Hey, shorty!
Yeah, you!
If you're short, you don't retort.
What did I say about cheating?
Sit back down!
You!
The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.
No, not you.
I mean...
You!
Hey, kid, let's rumble!
All right, all right!
So no one-on-ones today.
You're all such wimps!
He blackmailed me.
Fat woman, you're in charge here, right?
Fat woman, my ass!
I'm with the Axe Gang!
Axe Gang, my ass!
Boss!
Boss, my ass!
- You have to pay our medical bills!
- Bills, my ass!
- We're on the same side!
- Same side, my ass!
Think you're so tough?
I'll call for backup!
You nitwit!
Let's see you call backup!
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.
Don't you go away!
Go put a down payment on your coffin!
Who threw the firecracker?
I'm one of you, brother.
Mind your own business!
It's raining.
Go bring in your laundry!
Fat woman!
You blackmailing me too?
I ain't afraid.
I...
Did anyone see what happened?
Don't!
My back's broken!
Call for help!
Hold on, calm down.
You hungry?
Keep quiet.
No.
Who did this?
I'll count to three.
One two...
I did it!
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?
Sorry!
Look away, kid.
Get rid of him!
We're the bad guys!
We're meant to do the ass-kicking not the other way around.
And it's all because these morons posed as Axes.
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.
We'll handle this.
You!
Take care of it.
- Boy, can this guy pick locks.
- It's a living.
Give me a break.
Pick that one too, if you're so good.
Come.
I'll count to three.
Hurry!
Ready?
Three!
That's quick!
Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will!
Go on!
Thank you, Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before, you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living!
The streets out there are filled with money and women.
You only need the will and determination to seize the opportunity to win.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone, and we're in the gang.
Then it'll be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars with no ambition.
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'll smash your glasses!
Get lost!
Come here and say that!
- You're really gonna kill someone?
- That's right!
The four-eyes, the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty.
But they're good at kung fu.
- I can do kung fu!
- Oh, yeah?
Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist Palm kung fu?
Hey there, handsome boy.
Stop.
Amazing!
Do you know you have a special aura?
You're so young, but you have the bone structure... and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.
If your chi flow can be channeled, then you will be invincible!
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.
The duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours.
Sure.
This is the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
It's priceless.

I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.
We'll never hear the end of it.

Your wife shouldn't be so nasty.
You okay?
Masters.
We have nothing precious to give you but take this as a token of our appreciation.
Thanks for saving us!
Stop the crying.
This isn't a show!
- You're so cold-hearted.
- Talking back to me, eh?

It's no crime to be good at kung fu!

Calm down, Landlady.
This is your fault.
- Are you trying to kill us?
- You're right.
How could you do that?
Shut the hell up!
You think you can out-yell me?
The fat lady can really sing.
Watch this!
What happened?
What do you mean, what happened?
You try it.
- Me?
- Quick!
Sorry!
You okay?
I think you should get closer and take better aim.
Okay?
Okay!
- Who's throwing the handles?
- Handle?
Where's the third knife?
God knows where it went.
Could it be the same one?
Can't be...
- Don't!
- Sorry.
What are you trying to say?

Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good!
Don't block my view!
Damn!
I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry.
It's nothing!
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry, sorry!
Get out of my way!
Hang in there, Tailor.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the last we'll see of them.
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down!
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
People are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you I can now die in peace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.
Years ago we saw our only son killed in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters and we'll avenge them!
Becoming a top fighter takes time.
Unless you're a natural-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.
It's obvious I'm the one!
Don't think so.
Everyone!
We swore we'd never fight again.
But we broke that promise today.
For your own safety, please all leave!
In great power lies great responsibility.
There's no escaping from it.
Donut, you're hurt bad.
Rest now.
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
I know you, four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-challenged.
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?
Help me!
"Help me!
Help me!" Want to play, punks?
The Dragon Style?
The Tiger Style?
Come down here, and I'll smash your glasses.
Come on!
You know I'd do it, right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes all because of you!
You're a numb-nut!
Follow me!
It's a stickup!
Where's the money?
Where's the money?
What're you looking at?
I'm serious!
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.
The money's in here.
Let go of the girl!
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
Go away!
You're dragging me down!
Go home and raise pigs.
Go, before I kill you.
You!
Whatsyourname!
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!
- For real?
- Someone's waiting for you.
Brother Sum!
One look at you, and I knew you'd do anything.
Right!
You just needed your chance.
Damn right!
We've an assignment for you.
Anything, Brother Sum!
"Research on abnormal people. " What's that?
A mental asylum.
Soldiers!
Boy Scouts!
Tanks!
No worries.
When the Boy Scouts change shifts, you have exactly five minutes.
Follow the arrows on the map.
Go to the last cell and get the man inside there out.
Here's your tools.
What about you guys?
We're your lookouts.
Five minutes.
Hurry!
The world's top killer indeed looks the part!
It's only a title.
Cut the bullshit.
We want two people killed.
Name your price.
Name my what?
I've killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary.
So far, I've never found one.
That's why I stayed inside.
Had I met my match, I'd have been out long ago.
If you find me a worthy opponent I'll do it for free.
No charge!
Do you have someone?
Yes.
Brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge.
But first, will you show us some moves?
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.
You numskulls aren't worthy!
He doesn't look the part.
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'll clean up well.
You sure you got the right guy?
Absolutely.
I swear I did exactly what you told me.
Please show us some moves, Mr. Beast.
Don't make it hard for me!
You dumb or what?
You know what this is, old man?
Ever seen a fist this big?
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!
Really?
Try me, then.
Is he okay?
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
Harder!
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun!
In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
The real masters, together in one room!
Only the world's top killer has such an aura.
Likewise.
Could you two be the fated lovers...?
Paris and Helen of Troy!
A pleasure, indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang and only the Axe Gang.
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
With the Beast here, let's see whose funeral it is!
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you or be killed by you.
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
Piece of cake.
I can handle this.
Good try, but a little off target.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
- Looks like they're not up to it!
- Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
- I'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
- Go to hell!
You!
Come over here.
- Hit him!
- Yes!
- The head!
- Of course!
- Hit him on the head!
- Okay.
- Here's your chance.
- Got it!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
- Hit the shit out of him!
- Right!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
Beat the shit out of him!
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused!
Wow, that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
No one gets away from me!
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at least he finally made good.
Look at him!
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey, wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
There's no one here!
CHINESE MEDICINE
It's a miracle he lasted this long.
The herbs should help him.
Herbal medicine can only partly help.
The key is his own body structure.
All his bones and tendons are broken.
It's amazing he's recovering so fast.
It can't be possible...
Unless he's...
What's that smell?
You mustn't smoke while you're hurt.
Let me handle this.
This makes no sense.
Who knew the Beast could clear the chi flow and thus unleash the boy's true potential?
We should've guessed.
He is the one!
Is this for real?
You're still alive, you turncoat?
Kill him, men!
What kind of move is that?
Kids' stuff!
If our son were alive, he'd be his age now.
If he studies hard, he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer.
A stuntman, more likely!
Not bad.
Let's go.
I can even stop bullets...
What?
The Toad Style of the Kwan Lun School?
Oh, no!
Remember the Palm move that falls from heaven?
That's the long lost Buddhist Palm.
I surrender!
What kind of move was that?
If you want to learn, I'll teach you.
Master!
Hey!
Tell him not to put snot on the glass.
You two, put your pants on!
No licking if you're not buying!
Kid, you have the bone structure of a kung-fu genius.
Worid peace is in your hands.
Here's the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
Because it's fate, I'll let you have it for $ 10.
Wait!
You want more...?
INSPECTOR CHAN
SUPER CRIME FIGHTERS
Anyone else?
Such a beautiful woman and you arrest her just for spitting?
Is there no justice?
Is there no law?
Commissioner is only your boss because he paid his dues to the Crocodile Gang.
And you don't fucking know me?
Sorry, I didn't know she was your wife.
Ugly coward!
What are you looking at?
Never seen such a handsome gang boss?
Who'd be in the film business?
It's Sunday, and the theater's deserted.
Where's the car?
Let's go back inside!
Call for help!
No need for that, Northerner.
While you were messing with the cop, your men signed up with us.
I'll kill all you Axe Gangsters!
Stop!
You forget the time I treated you to dinner.
Brother Sum.
Please....
Please spare me.
Don't worry.
I don't kill women.
You can go!
Thank you, Big Brother.
Cops!
Come clean up the mess!
THE AXE GANG
In a time of social unrest and disorder...
In a time of social unrest and disorder the gangs have moved in to consolidate their power.
The most feared of them all is the Axe Gang.
Only in the poorest districts, which hold no interest for the gangs..
...can people live in peace.

-No problem!

NOODLES AND CONGEE
My check, please, Donut.
-How much?
-It's on the house!
Donut.
-It's nothing.
-I like you.
I'll ask the wife about lowering your rent.
Morning, Landlord!
Landlord!
Jill!
How you've grown!
Come let me examine you!
Good to see you, Landlord!
What's so good about it?
Don't...!
Can you make the skirt slit higher?
Sure!
Look, a comet!
Jane!
You naughty girl!
Landlord!
You're such a scoundrel!
Don't go, Jane!
Stay and chat!
I'm only kidding.
Jane!
Landlady!
Landlady!
What happened to the water?
Water ain't free!
You talk a lot for someone who won't pay his rent.
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.
You think that's a problem?
From now on, no water on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
I just love hearing you fools complain.
Assholes!
Good morning, Landlady!
Just pay your rent, or I'll burn your shop down.
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter, fairy!
Serves you right you're a coolie!
Months overdue and not even a "good morning."
You'll be a coolie for life.
There you go, handsome!
What took you so long with the congee?
I stopped to help an old lady cross the street.
-What are you doing here?
-Checking for Peeping T oms.
Was someone just spying on you, Auntie Six?
Don't shoot your mouth off without proof.
She's crazy.
Go away!
Please can you teach us, sir?
No more soccer!
-Who wants the cut?
-My boss.
T ake a seat.
Done!
Fifty cents, please.
Isn't it great?
It's too good!
Why'd you make him look so good?
Why?
Don't get mad, boss.
He's my old buddy.
I'll handle this.
He's boss of the Axe Gang.
Don't you see the two axes?
We're bad guys.
Making him look good is really bad.
Understand?
-I didn't know.
-You're a numskull!
But I like you, so just pay me, and I'll take care of it.
No way!
Steady with the axe, boss.
Let me talk to him.
I really care for you.
You saw it for yourself.
Seriously.
Why don't you pay up.
Not much.
Enough for a drink.
Oh, so it's blackmail!
Boss!
Boss!
Now you're dead!
Looks like he's waking up!
I'm not afraid.
You can kill me.
But there'll be thousands more of me!
You want to play tough?
The Axe Gang boss is napping in there.
Whoever wants to die, step forward.
So you want to fight?
Great!
We'll go one-on-one.
Don't even think about cheating.
That old woman with the onion!
You look real tough.
Want to try me?
I'll let you hit me first.
What do you do?
I'm a farmer.
Farmers don't fight.
Piss off!
He's crazy!
Calling me names?
You're lucky you're a woman.
Hey, shorty!
Yeah, you!
If you're short, you don't retort.
What did I say about cheating?
Sit back down!
You!
The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.
No, not you.
I mean....
You!
Hey, kid, let's rumble!
All right, all right!
So no one-on-ones today.
You're all such wimps!
He blackmailed me.
Fat woman, you're in charge here, right?
Fat woman, my ass!
I'm with the Axe Gang!
Axe Gang, my ass!
Boss!
Boss, my ass!
-You have to pay our medical bills!
-Bills, my ass!
-We're on the same side!
-Same side, my ass!
Think you're so tough?
I'll call for backup!
You nitwit!
Let's see you call backup!
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.
Don't you go away!
Go put a down payment on your coffin!
Who threw the firecracker?
I'm one of you, brother.
Mind your own business!
It's raining.
Go bring in your laundry!
Fat woman!
You blackmailing me too?
I ain't afraid.
I....
Did anyone see what happened?
Don't!
My back's broken!
Call for help!
Hold on, calm down.
You hungry?
Keep quiet.
No.
Who did this?
I'll count to three.
One two....
I did it!
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?
Sorry!
Look away, kid.
Get rid of him!
We're the bad guys!
We're meant to do the ass-kicking not the other way around.
And it's all because these morons posed as Axes.
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.
We'll handle this.
You!
Take care of it.
-Boy, can this guy pick locks.
-It's a living.
Give me a break.
Pick that one too, if you're so good.
Come.
I'll count to three.
Hurry!
Ready?
Three!
That's quick!
Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will!
Go on!
Thank you, Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before, you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living!
The streets out there are filled with money and women.
You only need the will and determination to seize the opportunity to win.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone, and we're in the gang.
Then it'll be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars with no ambition.
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'll smash your glasses!
Get lost!
Come here and say that!
-You're really gonna kill someone?
-That's right!
The four-eyes, the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty.
But they're good at kung fu.
-I can do kung fu!
-Oh, yeah?
Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist Palm kung fu?
Hey there, handsome boy.
Stop.
Amazing!
Do you know you have a special aura?
You're so young, but you have the bone structure... and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.
If your chi flow can be channeled, then you will be invincible!
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.
The duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours.
Sure.
This is the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
It's priceless.
But as it's fate, I'll let you have it for $1 0.

-You gave him your life savings?
-Yes.
I was saving to study to be a doctor or lawyer but this was world peace.
Let go of the girl!
Hey!
It's the Buddhist Palm!
"The 20-Cent Kung Fu Manual."
You must be loaded.
Have you killed anyone lately?
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
I realized then that good guys never win.
I want to be bad.
I want to be the killer!
-lce cream!
-Where?
Make mine a vanilla.
Chocolate for me!
What're you looking at?
Never seen free ice cream before?
Look at her run!
You're such kung-fu masters, go take it on the road.
You belong in the circus, not here!
Don't say that, Landlady.
There must be a reason they're here.
Everyone has his reasons.
We don't want to make trouble.
I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.
We'll never hear the end of it.
Why don't you get lost!
Your wife shouldn't be so nasty.
You okay?
Masters.
We have nothing precious to give you but take this as a token of our appreciation.
Thanks for saving us!
Stop the crying.
This isn't a show!
-You're so cold-hearted.
-Talking back to me, eh?
You may know kung fu, but you're still a fairy.
It's no crime to be good at kung fu!
Once a fairy, always a fairy.
Look at you.
What's with the red underwear?
Why not a diaper while you're at it.
What's wrong with red underwear?
Where were you when there was trouble?
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.
Be reasonable!
I'll reason with you.
You owe me three months' rent.
That's $90.
Pay up or pack up!
Don't you worry.
I'll pay it.
Think you're a smartass, Rabbit-Tooth Jane?
What's it to you, tub of lard?
Bitch!
Calm down, Landlady.
This is your fault.
-Are you trying to kill us?
-You're right.
How could you do that?
Shut the hell up!
You think you can out-yell me?
The fat lady can really sing.
Watch this!
What happened?
What do you mean, what happened?
You try it.
-Me?
-Quick!
Sorry!
You okay?
I think you should get closer and take better aim.
Okay?
Okay!
-Who's throwing the handles?
-Handle?
Where's the third knife?
God knows where it went.
Could it be the same one?
Can't be....
-Don't!
-Sorry.
What are you trying to say?
I just remembered I have something to do.
See you!
Uh-oh.
They've seen us!
Stay back!
Don't panic!
Snakes like music.
If I whistle, they won't bite.
Please, no more bright ideas.
Oh, what the hell!
Not you again, asshole!
Get back to your business!
Split up!
Split?
What're you doing here?
Looking for you.
Weren't you hurt?
I'm fine!
How come you always recover so fast?
I don't know.
-Which hospital did you go to?
-Don't remember.
Maybe it's better that way.
Memories can be painful.
T o forget may be a blessing!
I never knew you were so deep.
All the sadness one can bear down the river everywhere.
Hey, get out of the way!
Move!
I'll slap you to kingdom come!
Look at those four-eyes carting around a coffin.
What morons!
Don't blame me for making you leave.
We'll let Buddha decide whether you stay or go.
HORRlFlCALLY BAD FATE
Have some tea.
We're grateful for some professional help.
We understand the problem.
Twelve Kicks from the Tam School Iron Fist from the Hung School and the Hexagon Staff....
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.
Their warrior days are long over but they're still top fighters.
This job is a great challenge for us.
Now, that's professionalism.
Number One Killers.
Expensive, yes, but worth every penny!
No!
Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer.
He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
Strictly speaking, we're just musicians.
A song that wrenches the heart O where do I find a knowing ear?
Great poem, isn't it?
We'll be saying goodbye soon.
Who knows when we'll see each other again.
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a lot to pack.
You're right.
Twelve Kicks of the T am School!
Superb attack and defense!
Iron Fist: powerful yet delicate.
T opnotch!
Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves.
Mystical!
Till we meet again!
More lipstick!
Stay there, or I'll break you in half.
Sorry, we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material!
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories....
Insulting the Axe Gang!
We'll show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good!
Don't block my view!
Damn!
I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here.
-Really?
-Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry.
It's nothing!
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry, sorry!
Get out of my way!
Hang in there, T ailor.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the last we'll see of them.
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down!
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
People are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you I can now die in peace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.
Years ago we saw our only son killed in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters and we'll avenge them!
Becoming a top fighter takes time.
Unless you're a natural-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.
It's obvious I'm the one!
Don't think so.
Everyone!
We swore we'd never fight again.
But we broke that promise today.
For your own safety, please all leave!
In great power lies great responsibility.
There's no escaping from it.
Donut, you're hurt bad.
Rest now.
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
I know you, four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-challenged.
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?
Help me!
"Help me!
Help me!" Want to play, punks?
The Dragon Style?
The Tiger Style?
Come down here, and I'll smash your glasses.
Come on!
You know I'd do it, right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes all because of you!
You're a numb-nut!
Follow me!
It's a stickup!
Where's the money?
Where's the money?
What're you looking at?
I'm serious!
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.
The money's in here.
Let go of the girl!
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
Go away!
You're dragging me down!
Go home and raise pigs.
Go, before I kill you.
You!

Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!

-Someone's waiting for you.

Absolutely.
I swear I did exactly what you told me.
Please show us some moves, Mr. Beast.
Don't make it hard for me!
You dumb or what?
You know what this is, old man?
Ever seen a fist this big?
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!
Really?
Try me, then.
Is he okay?
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
Harder!
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun!
In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
The real masters, together in one room!
Only the world's top killer has such an aura.
Likewise.
Could you two be the fated lovers...?
Paris and Helen of Troy!
A pleasure, indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang and only the Axe Gang.
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
With the Beast here, let's see whose funeral it is!
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you or be killed by you.
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
Piece of cake.
I can handle this.
Good try, but a little off target.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
-Looks like they're not up to it!
-Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
-I'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
-Go to hell!
You!
Come over here.
-Hit him!
-Yes!
-The head!
-Of course!
-Hit him on the head!
-Okay.
-Here's your chance.
-Got it!
-Hit him!
-Hit him!
-Hit the shit out of him!
-Right!
-Hit him!
-Hit him!
Beat the shit out of him!
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused!
Wow, that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
No one gets away from me!
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at least he finally made good.
Look at him!
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey, wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
There's no one here!
chinese medicine
It's a miracle he lasted this long.
The herbs should help him.
Herbal medicine can only partly help.
The key is his own body structure.
All his bones and tendons are broken.
It's amazing he's recovering so fast.
It can't be possible....
Unless he's....
What's that smell?
You mustn't smoke while you're hurt.
Let me handle this.
This makes no sense.
Who knew the Beast could clear the chi flow and thus unleash the boy's true potential?
We should've guessed.
He is the one!
Is this for real?
You're still alive, you turncoat?
Kill him, men!
What kind of move is that?
Kids' stuff!
If our son were alive, he'd be his age now.
If he studies hard, he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer.
A stuntman, more likely!
Not bad.
Let's go.
I can even stop bullets--
What?
The T oad Style of the Kwan Lun School?
Oh, no!
Remember the Palm move that falls from heaven?
That's the long lost Buddhist Palm.
I surrender!
What kind of move was that?
If you want to learn, I'll teach you.
Master!
Hey!
T ell him not to put snot on the glass.
You two, put your pants on!
No licking if you're not buying!
Kid, you have the bone structure of a kung-fu genius.
World peace is in your hands.
Here's the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
Because it's fate, I'll let you have it for $1 0.
Wait!
You want more...?

What happened to the water?
Water ain't free!
You talk a Iot for someone who won't pay his rent.
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.
You think that's a problem?
From now on, no water on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
I just love hearing you fools complain.
assholes!
Good morning, LandIady!
Just pay your rent, or I'II burn your shop down.
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter, fairy!
Serves you right you're a coolie!
Months overdue and not even a "good morning."
You'II be a coolie for life.
There you go, handsome!
What took you so long with the congee?
I stopped to help an old lady cross the street.
-What are you doing here?
-Checking for Peeping Toms.
Was someone just spying on you, Auntie Six?
Don't shoot your mouth off without proof.
She's crazy.
Go away!
please can you teach us, sir?
No more soccer!
-Who wants the cut?
-My boss.
Take a seat.
Done!
Fifty cents, please.
Isn't it great?
It's too good!
Why'd you make him look so good?
Why?
Don't get mad, boss.
He's my old buddy.
I'II handle this.
He's boss of the Axe Gang.
Don't you see the two axes?
We're bad guys.
Making him look good is really bad.
Understand?
-I didn't know.
-You're a numskull!
But I Iike you, so just pay me, and I'II take care of it.
No way!
Steady with the axe, boss.
Let me talk to him.
I really care for you.
You saw it for yourself.
seriously.
Why don't you pay up.
Not much.
Enough for a drink.
Oh, so it's blackmail!
Boss!
Boss!
Now you're dead!
Looks like he's waking up!
I'm not afraid.
You can kill me.
But there'II be thousands more of me!
You want to play tough?
The Axe Gang boss is napping in there.
Whoever wants to die, step forward.
So you want to fight?
Great!
We'II go one-on-one.
Don't even think about cheating.
That old woman with the onion!
You look real tough.
Want to try me?
I'II let you hit me first.
What do you do?
I'm a farmer.
Farmers don't fight.
Piss off!
He's crazy!
calling me names?
You're lucky you're a woman.
Hey, shorty!
Yeah, you!
If you're short, you don't retort.
What did I say about cheating?
Sit back down!
You!
The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.
No, not you.
I mean....
You!
Hey, kid, Iet's rumble!
AII right, all right!
So no one-on-ones today.
You're all such wimps!
He blackmailed me.
Fat woman, you're in charge here, right?
Fat woman, my ass!
I'm with the Axe Gang!
Axe Gang, my ass!
Boss!
Boss, my ass!
-You have to pay our medical bills!

-We're on the same side!
-Same side, my ass!
Think you're so tough?
I'II call for backup!
You nitwit!
Let's see you call backup!
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.
Don't you go away!
Go put a down payment on your coffin!
Who threw the firecracker?
I'm one of you, brother.
Mind your own business!
It's raining.
Go bring in your laundry!
Fat woman!
You bIackmaiIing me too?
I ain't afraid.

Did anyone see what happened?
Don't!
My back's broken!

You hungry?
Keep quiet.
No.
Who did this?
I'II count to three.
One two....
I did it!
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?
Sorry!
Look away, kid.
Get rid of him!
We're the bad guys!
We're meant to do the ass-kicking not the other way around.
And it's all because these morons posed as Axes.
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.
We'II handle this.
You!
Take care of it.
-Boy, can this guy pick locks.
-It's a living.
Give me a break.
Pick that one too, if you're so good.
Come.
I'II count to three.
Hurry!
Ready?
Three!
That's quick!
Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will!
Go on!
Thank you, Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before, you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living!
The streets out there are filled with money and women.
You only need the will and determination to seize the opportunity to win.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone, and we're in the gang.
Then it'II be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars with no ambition.
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'II smash your glasses!
Get lost!
Come here and say that!
-You're really gonna kill someone?
-That's right!
The four-eyes, the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty.
But they're good at kung fu.
-I can do kung fu!
-Oh, yeah?
Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist palm kung fu?
Hey there, handsome boy.
Stop.
Amazing!
Do you know you have a special aura?
You're so young, but you have the bone structure... and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.
If your chi flow can be channeled, then you will be invincible!
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.
The duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours.
Sure.
This is the scroll of the Buddhist palm.
It's priceless.
But as it's fate, I'II let you have it for $ 1 0.
BUDDHIST PALM MANUAL
-You gave him your life savings?
-Yes.
I was saving to study to be a doctor or lawyer but this was world peace.
Let go of the girl!
Hey!
It's the Buddhist palm!
"The 20-Cent Kung Fu manual."
You must be loaded.
Have you killed anyone lately?
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
I realized then that good guys never win.
I want to be bad.
I want to be the killer!
-Ice cream!
-Where?
Make mine a vanilla.
chocolate for me!
What're you looking at?
Never seen free ice cream before?
Look at her run!
You're such kung-fu masters, go take it on the road.
You belong in the circus, not here!
Don't say that, LandIady.
There must be a reason they're here.
Everyone has his reasons.
We don't want to make trouble.
I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.
We'II never hear the end of it.
Why don't you get lost!
Your wife shouIdn't be so nasty.
You okay?
Masters.
We have nothing precious to give you but take this as a token of our appreciation.
Thanks for saving us!
Stop the crying.
This isn't a show!
-You're so coId-hearted.
-talking back to me, eh?
You may know kung fu, but you're still a fairy.
It's no crime to be good at kung fu!
Once a fairy, always a fairy.
Look at you.
What's with the red underwear?
Why not a diaper while you're at it.
What's wrong with red underwear?
Where were you when there was trouble?
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.
Be reasonable!
I'II reason with you.
You owe me three months' rent.
That's $90.
Pay up or pack up!
Don't you worry.
I'II pay it.
Think you're a smartass, Rabbit-Tooth Jane?
What's it to you, tub of lard?
Bitch!
calm down, LandIady.
This is your fault.
-Are you trying to kill us?
-You're right.
How could you do that?
Shut the hell up!
You think you can out-yeII me?
The fat lady can really sing.
Watch this!
What happened?
What do you mean, what happened?
You try it.
-Me?
-Quick!
Sorry!
You okay?
I think you should get closer and take better aim.
Okay?
Okay!
-Who's throwing the handles?
-handle?
Where's the third knife?
God knows where it went.
could it be the same one?
Can't be....
-Don't!
-Sorry.
What are you trying to say?
I just remembered I have something to do.
See you!
Uh-oh.
They've seen us!
Stay back!
Don't panic!
Snakes like music.
If I whistle, they won't bite.
please, no more bright ideas.
Oh, what the hell!
Not you again, asshole!
Get back to your business!
split up!
split?
What're you doing here?
Looking for you.
Weren't you hurt?
I'm fine!
How come you always recover so fast?
I don't know.
-Which hospital did you go to?
-Don't remember.
Maybe it's better that way.
Memories can be painful.
To forget may be a blessing!
I never knew you were so deep.
AII the sadness one can bear down the river everywhere.
Hey, get out of the way!
Move!
I'II slap you to kingdom come!
Look at those four-eyes carting around a coffin.
What morons!
Don't blame me for making you leave.
We'II let Buddha decide whether you stay or go.
HORRIFICALLY BAD FATE
Have some tea.
We're grateful for some professional help.
We understand the problem.
twelve Kicks from the Tam school Iron Fist from the Hung school and the Hexagon Staff....
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.
Their warrior days are long over but they're still top fighters.
This job is a great challenge for us.
Now, that's professionalism.
Number One killers.
Expensive, yes, but worth every penny!
No!
Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer.
He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
strictly speaking, we're just musicians.
A song that wrenches the heart O where do I find a knowing ear?
Great poem, isn't it?
We'II be saying goodbye soon.
Who knows when we'II see each other again.
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a Iot to pack.
You're right.
twelve Kicks of the Tam school!
Superb attack and defense!
Iron Fist: powerful yet delicate.
Topnotch!
Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves.
mystical!
till we meet again!
More Iipstick!
Stay there, or I'II break you in half.
Sorry, we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material!
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories....
insulting the Axe Gang!
We'II show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good!
Don't block my view!
Damn!
I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here.
-really?
-Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'II pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry.
It's nothing!
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry, sorry!
Get out of my way!
Hang in there, tailor.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the Iast we'II see of them.
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down!
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
people are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you I can now die in peace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.
Years ago we saw our only son killed in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters and we'II avenge them!
Becoming a top fighter takes time.
unless you're a naturaI-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.
It's obvious I'm the one!
Don't think so.
Everyone!
We swore we'd never fight again.
But we broke that promise today.
For your own safety, please all leave!
In great power lies great responsibility.
There's no escaping from it.
Donut, you're hurt bad.
Rest now.
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
I know you, four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-chaIIenged.
That's right.
especially goId-framed four-eyes.
gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I Iook good.
So why keep picking on me?
help me!
"help me!
help me!" Want to play, punks?
The Dragon style?
The Tiger style?
Come down here, and I'II smash your glasses.
Come on!
You know I'd do it, right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes all because of you!
You're a numb-nut!
follow me!
It's a stickup!
Where's the money?
Where's the money?
What're you looking at?
I'm serious!
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.
The money's in here.
Let go of the girl!
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
Go away!
You're dragging me down!
Go home and raise pigs.
Go, before I kill you.
You!
Whatsyourname!
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!
-For real?
-Someone's waiting for you.
Brother Sum!
One look at you, and I knew you'd do anything.
Right!
You just needed your chance.
Damn right!
We've an assignment for you.
Anything, Brother Sum!
"Research on abnormal people." What's that?
A mental asylum.

Boy Scouts!
Tanks!
No worries.
When the Boy Scouts change shifts, you have exactly five minutes.
follow the arrows on the map.
Go to the Iast cell and get the man inside there out.
Here's your tools.
What about you guys?
We're your Iookouts.
Five minutes.
Hurry!
The world's top killer indeed looks the part!
It's only a title.
Cut the bullshit.
We want two people killed.
Name your price.
Name my what?
I've killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary.
So far, I've never found one.
That's why I stayed inside.
Had I met my match, I'd have been out long ago.
If you find me a worthy opponent I'II do it for free.
No charge!
Do you have someone?
Yes.
brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge.
But first, will you show us some moves?
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.
You numskuIIs aren't worthy!
He doesn't look the part.
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'II clean up well.
You sure you got the right guy?
absolutely.
I swear I did exactly what you told me.
please show us some moves, Mr. Beast.
Don't make it hard for me!
You dumb or what?
You know what this is, old man?
Ever seen a fist this big?
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!
really?
Try me, then.
Is he okay?
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
Harder!
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun!
In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
The real masters, together in one room!
only the world's top killer has such an aura.
Likewise.
could you two be the fated lovers...?
Paris and helen of Troy!
A pleasure, indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang and only the Axe Gang.
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
With the Beast here, Iet's see whose funeral it is!
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you or be killed by you.
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
Piece of cake.
I can handle this.
Good try, but a little off target.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
-Looks like they're not up to it!
-Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
-I'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
-Go to hell!
You!
Come over here.
-Hit him!
-Yes!
-The head!
-Of course!
-Hit him on the head!
-Okay.
-Here's your chance.
-Got it!
-Hit him!
-Hit him!
-Hit the shit out of him!
-Right!
-Hit him!
-Hit him!
Beat the shit out of him!
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused!
Wow, that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
No one gets away from me!
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at Ieast he finally made good.
Look at him!
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey, wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
There's no one here!

Not bad.

But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.
You think that's a problem?
From now on, no water on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
I just love hearing you fools complain.
Assholes!
Good morning, Landlady!
Just pay your rent, or I'll burn your shop down.
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter, fairy!
Serves you right you're a coolie!
Months overdue and not even a "good morning."
You'll be a coolie for life.
There you go, handsome!
What took you so long with the congee?
I stopped to help an old lady cross the street.
- What are you doing here?
- Checking for Peeping Toms.
Was someone just spying on you, Auntie Six?
Don't shoot your mouth off without proof.
She's crazy.
Go away!
Please can you teach us, sir?
No more soccer!
- Who wants the cut?
- My boss.
Take a seat.
Done!
Fifty cents, please.
Isn't it great?
It's too good!
Why'd you make him look so good?
Why?
Don't get mad, boss.
He's my old buddy.
I'll handle this.
He's boss of the Axe Gang.
Don't you see the two axes?
We're bad guys.
Making him look good is really bad.
Understand?
- I didn't know.
- You're a numskull!
But I like you, so just pay me, and I'll take care of it.
No way!
Steady with the axe, boss.
Let me talk to him.
I really care for you.
You saw it for yourself.
Seriously.
Why don't you pay up.
Not much.
Enough for a drink.
Oh, so it's blackmail!
Boss!
Boss!
Now you're dead!
Looks like he's waking up!
I'm not afraid.
You can kill me.
But there'll be thousands more of me!
You want to play tough?
The Axe Gang boss is napping in there.
Whoever wants to die, step forward.
So you want to fight?
Great!
We'll go one-on-one.
Don't even think about cheating.
That old woman with the onion!
You look real tough.
Want to try me?
I'll let you hit me first.
What do you do?
I'm a farmer.
Farmers don't fight.
Piss off!
He's crazy!
Calling me names?
You're lucky you're a woman.
Hey, shorty!
Yeah, you!
If you're short, you don't retort.
What did I say about cheating?
Sit back down!
You!
The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.
No, not you.
I mean...
You!
Hey, kid, let's rumble!
All right, all right!
So no one-on-ones today.
You're all such wimps!
He blackmailed me.
Fat woman, you're in charge here, right?
Fat woman, my ass!
I'm with the Axe Gang!
Axe Gang, my ass!
Boss!
Boss, my ass!
- You have to pay our medical bills!
- Bills, my ass!
- We're on the same side!
- Same side, my ass!
Think you're so tough?
I'll call for backup!
You nitwit!
Let's see you call backup!
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.
Don't you go away!
Go put a down payment on your coffin!
Who threw the firecracker?
I'm one of you, brother.
Mind your own business!
It's raining.
Go bring in your laundry!
Fat woman!
You blackmailing me too?
I ain't afraid.
I...
Did anyone see what happened?
Don't!
My back's broken!
Call for help!
Hold on, calm down.
You hungry?
Keep quiet.
No.
Who did this?
I'll count to three.
One two...
I did it!
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?
Sorry!
Look away, kid.
Get rid of him!
We're the bad guys!
We're meant to do the ass-kicking not the other way around.
And it's all because these morons posed as Axes.
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.
We'll handle this.
You!
Take care of it.
- Boy, can this guy pick locks.
- It's a living.
Give me a break.
Pick that one too, if you're so good.
Come.
I'll count to three.
Hurry!
Ready?
Three!
That's quick!
Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will!
Go on!
Thank you, Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before, you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living!
The streets out there are filled with money and women.
You only need the will and determination to seize the opportunity to win.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone, and we're in the gang.
Then it'll be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars with no ambition.
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'll smash your glasses!
Get lost!
Come here and say that!
- You're really gonna kill someone?
- That's right!
The four-eyes, the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty.
But they're good at kung fu.
- I can do kung fu!
- Oh, yeah?
Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist Palm kung fu?
Hey there, handsome boy.
Stop.
Amazing!
Do you know you have a special aura?
You're so young, but you have the bone structure... and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.
If your chi flow can be channeled, then you will be invincible!
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.
The duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours.
Sure.
This is the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
It's priceless.
But as it's fate, I'll let you have it for $ 10.
BUDDHIST PALM MANUAL
- You gave him your life savings?
- Yes.
I was saving to study to be a doctor or lawyer but this was world peace.
Let go of the girl!
Hey!
It's the Buddhist Palm!
"The 20-Cent Kung Fu Manual."
You must be loaded.
Have you killed anyone lately?
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
I realized then that good guys never win.
I want to be bad.
I want to be the killer!
- Ice cream!
- Where?
Make mine a vanilla.
Chocolate for me!
What're you looking at?
Never seen free ice cream before?
Look at her run!
You're such kung-fu masters, go take it on the road.
You belong in the circus, not here!
Don't say that, Landlady.
There must be a reason they're here.
Everyone has his reasons.
We don't want to make trouble.
I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.
We'll never hear the end of it.
Why don't you get lost!
Your wife shouldn't be so nasty.
You okay?
Masters.
We have nothing precious to give you but take this as a token of our appreciation.
Thanks for saving us!
Stop the crying.
This isn't a show!
- You're so cold-hearted.
- Talking back to me, eh?
You may know kung fu, but you're still a fairy.
It's no crime to be good at kung fu!
Once a fairy, always a fairy.
Look at you.
What's with the red underwear?
Why not a diaper while you're at it.
What's wrong with red underwear?
Where were you when there was trouble?
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.
Be reasonable!
I'll reason with you.
You owe me three months' rent.
That's $90.
Pay up or pack up!
Don't you worry.
I'll pay it.
Think you're a smartass, Rabbit-Tooth Jane?
What's it to you, tub of lard?
Bitch!
Calm down, Landlady.
This is your fault.
- Are you trying to kill us?
- You're right.
How could you do that?
Shut the hell up!
You think you can out-yell me?
The fat lady can really sing.
Watch this!
What happened?
What do you mean, what happened?
You try it.
- Me?
- Quick!
Sorry!
You okay?
I think you should get closer and take better aim.
Okay?
Okay!
- Who's throwing the handles?
- Handle?
Where's the third knife?
God knows where it went.
Could it be the same one?
Can't be...
- Don't!
- Sorry.
What are you trying to say?
I just remembered I have something to do.
See you!
Uh-oh.
They've seen us!
Stay back!
Don't panic!
Snakes like music.
If I whistle, they won't bite.
Please, no more bright ideas.
Oh, what the hell!
Not you again, asshole!
Get back to your business!
Split up!
Split?
What're you doing here?
Looking for you.
Weren't you hurt?
I'm fine!
How come you always recover so fast?
I don't know.
- Which hospital did you go to?
- Don't remember.
Maybe it's better that way.
Memories can be painful.
To forget may be a blessing!
I never knew you were so deep.
All the sadness one can bear down the river everywhere.
Hey, get out of the way!
Move!
I'll slap you to kingdom come!
Look at those four-eyes carting around a coffin.
What morons!
Don't blame me for making you leave.
We'll let Buddha decide whether you stay or go.
HORRIFICALLY BAD FATE
Have some tea.
We're grateful for some professional help.
We understand the problem.
Twelve Kicks from the Tam School Iron Fist from the Hung School and the Hexagon Staff...
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.
Their warrior days are long over but they're still top fighters.
This job is a great challenge for us.
Now, that's professionalism.
Number One Killers.
Expensive, yes, but worth every penny!
No!
Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer.
He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
Strictly speaking, we're just musicians.
A song that wrenches the heart O where do I find a knowing ear?
Great poem, isn't it?
We'll be saying goodbye soon.
Who knows when we'll see each other again.
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a lot to pack.
You're right.
Twelve Kicks of the Tam School!
Superb attack and defense!
Iron Fist: powerful yet delicate.
Topnotch!
Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves.
Mystical!
Till we meet again!
More lipstick!
Stay there, or I'll break you in half.
Sorry, we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material!
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories...
Insulting the Axe Gang!
We'll show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good!
Don't block my view!
Damn!
I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry.
It's nothing!
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry, sorry!
Get out of my way!
Hang in there, Tailor.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the last we'll see of them.
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down!
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
People are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you I can now die in peace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.
Years ago we saw our only son killed in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters and we'll avenge them!
Becoming a top fighter takes time.
Unless you're a natural-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.
It's obvious I'm the one!
Don't think so.
Everyone!
We swore we'd never fight again.
But we broke that promise today.
For your own safety, please all leave!
In great power lies great responsibility.
There's no escaping from it.
Donut, you're hurt bad.
Rest now.
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
I know you, four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-challenged.
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?
Help me!
"Help me!
Help me!" Want to play, punks?
The Dragon Style?
The Tiger Style?
Come down here, and I'll smash your glasses.
Come on!
You know I'd do it, right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes all because of you!
You're a numb-nut!
Follow me!
It's a stickup!
Where's the money?
Where's the money?
What're you looking at?
I'm serious!
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.
The money's in here.
Let go of the girl!
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
Go away!
You're dragging me down!
Go home and raise pigs.
Go, before I kill you.
You!
Whatsyourname!
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!
- For real?
- Someone's waiting for you.
Brother Sum!
One look at you, and I knew you'd do anything.
Right!
You just needed your chance.
Damn right!
We've an assignment for you.
Anything, Brother Sum!
"Research on abnormal people." What's that?
A mental asylum.
Soldiers!
Boy Scouts!
Tanks!
No worries.
When the Boy Scouts change shifts, you have exactly five minutes.
Follow the arrows on the map.
Go to the last cell and get the man inside there out.
Here's your tools.
What about you guys?
We're your lookouts.
Five minutes.
Hurry!
The world's top killer indeed looks the part!
It's only a title.
Cut the bullshit.
We want two people killed.
Name your price.
Name my what?
I've killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary.
So far, I've never found one.
That's why I stayed inside.
Had I met my match, I'd have been out long ago.
If you find me a worthy opponent I'll do it for free.
No charge!
Do you have someone?
Yes.
Brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge.
But first, will you show us some moves?
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.
You numskulls aren't worthy!
He doesn't look the part.
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'll clean up well.
You sure you got the right guy?
Absolutely.
I swear I did exactly what you told me.
Please show us some moves, Mr. Beast.
Don't make it hard for me!
You dumb or what?
You know what this is, old man?
Ever seen a fist this big?
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!
Really?
Try me, then.
Is he okay?
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
Harder!
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun!
In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
The real masters, together in one room!
Only the world's top killer has such an aura.
Likewise.
Could you two be the fated lovers...?
Paris and Helen of Troy!
A pleasure, indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang and only the Axe Gang.
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
With the Beast here, let's see whose funeral it is!
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you or be killed by you.
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
Piece of cake.
I can handle this.
Good try, but a little off target.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
- Looks like they're not up to it!
- Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
- I'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
- Go to hell!
You!
Come over here.
- Hit him!
- Yes!
- The head!
- Of course!
- Hit him on the head!
- Okay.
- Here's your chance.
- Got it!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
- Hit the shit out of him!
- Right!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
Beat the shit out of him!
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused!
Wow, that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
No one gets away from me!
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at least he finally made good.
Look at him!
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey, wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
There's no one here!
CHINESE MEDICINE
It's a miracle he lasted this long.
The herbs should help him.
Herbal medicine can only partly help.
The key is his own body structure.
All his bones and tendons are broken.
It's amazing he's recovering so fast.
It can't be possible...
Unless he's...
What's that smell?
You mustn't smoke while you're hurt.
Let me handle this.
This makes no sense.
Who knew the Beast could clear the chi flow and thus unleash the boy's true potential?
We should've guessed.
He is the one!
Is this for real?
You're still alive, you turncoat?
Kill him, men!
What kind of move is that?
Kids' stuff!
If our son were alive, he'd be his age now.
If he studies hard, he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer.
A stuntman, more likely!
Not bad.
Let's go.
I can even stop bullets...
What?
The Toad Style of the Kwan Lun School?
Oh, no!
Remember the Palm move that falls from heaven?
That's the long lost Buddhist Palm.
I surrender!
What kind of move was that?
If you want to learn, I'll teach you.
Master!
Hey!
Tell him not to put snot on the glass.
You two, put your pants on!
No licking if you're not buying!
Kid, you have the bone structure of a kung-fu genius.
World peace is in your hands.
Here's the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
Because it's fate, I'll let you have it for $ 10.
Wait!
You want more...?
INSPECTOR CHAN
SUPER CRIME FIGHTERS
Anyone else?
Such a beautiful woman and you arrest her just for spitting?
Is there no justice?
Is there no law?
Commissioner is only your boss because he paid his dues to the Crocodile Gang.
And you don't fucking know me?
Sorry, I didn't know she was your wife.
Ugly coward!
What are you looking at?
Never seen such a handsome gang boss?
Who'd be in the film business?
It's Sunday, and the theater's deserted.
Where's the car?
Let's go back inside!
Call for help!
No need for that, Northerner.
While you were messing with the cop, your men signed up with us.
I'll kill all you Axe Gangsters!
Stop!
You forget the time I treated you to dinner.
Brother Sum.
Please...
Please spare me.
Don't worry.
I don't kill women.
You can go!
Thank you, Big Brother.
Cops!
Come clean up the mess!
THE AXE GANG
In a time of social unrest and disorder the gangs have moved in to consolidate their power.
The most feared of them all is the Axe Gang.
Only in the poorest districts, which hold no interest for the gangs can people live in peace.
PIG STY ALLE Y
One, two, three!
- That okay, Coolie?
- No problem!
TAILOR
NOODLES AND CONGEE
My check, please, Donut.
- How much?
- It's on the house!
Donut.
- It's nothing.
- I like you.
I'll ask the wife about lowering your rent.
Morning, Landlord!
Landlord!
Jill!
How you've grown!
Come let me examine you!
Good to see you, Landlord!
What's so good about it?
Don't...!
Can you make the skirt slit higher?
Sure!
Look, a comet!
Jane!
You naughty girl!
Landlord!
You're such a scoundrel!
Don't go, Jane!
Stay and chat!
I'm only kidding.
Jane!
Landlady!
Landlady!
What happened to the water?
Water ain't free!
You talk a lot for someone who won't pay his rent.
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.
You think that's a problem?
From now on, no water on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
I just love hearing you fools complain.
Assholes!
Good morning, Landlady!
Just pay your rent, or I'll burn your shop down.
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter, fairy!
Serves you right you're a coolie!
Months overdue and not even a "good morning. "
You'll be a coolie for life.
There you go, handsome!
What took you so long with the congee?
I stopped to help an old lady cross the street.
- What are you doing here?
- Checking for Peeping Toms.
Was someone just spying on you, Auntie Six?
Don't shoot your mouth off without proof.
She's crazy.
Go away!
Please can you teach us, sir?
No more soccer!
- Who wants the cut?
- My boss.
Take a seat.
Done!
Fifty cents, please.
Isn't it great?
It's too good!
Why'd you make him look so good?
Why?
Don't get mad, boss.
He's my old buddy.
I'll handle this.
He's boss of the Axe Gang.
Don't you see the two axes?
We're bad guys.
Making him look good is really bad.
Understand?
- I didn't know.
- You're a numskull!
But I like you, so just pay me, and I'll take care of it.
No way!
Steady with the axe, boss.
Let me talk to him.
I really care for you.
You saw it for yourself.
Seriously.
Why don't you pay up.
Not much.
Enough for a drink.
Oh, so it's blackmail!
Boss!
Boss!
Now you're dead!
Looks like he's waking up!
I'm not afraid.
You can kill me.
But there'll be thousands more of me!
You want to play tough?
The Axe Gang boss is napping in there.
Whoever wants to die, step forward.
So you want to fight?
Great!
We'll go one-on-one.
Don't even think about cheating.
That old woman with the onion!
You look real tough.
Want to try me?
I'll let you hit me first.
What do you do?
I'm a farmer.
Farmers don't fight.
Piss off!
He's crazy!
Calling me names?
You're lucky you're a woman.
Hey, shorty!
Yeah, you!
If you're short, you don't retort.
What did I say about cheating?
Sit back down!
You!
The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.
No, not you.
I mean...
You!
Hey, kid, let's rumble!
All right, all right!
So no one-on-ones today.
You're all such wimps!
He blackmailed me.
Fat woman, you're in charge here, right?
Fat woman, my ass!
I'm with the Axe Gang!
Axe Gang, my ass!
Boss!
Boss, my ass!
- You have to pay our medical bills!
- Bills, my ass!
- We're on the same side!
- Same side, my ass!
Think you're so tough?
I'll call for backup!
You nitwit!
Let's see you call backup!
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.
Don't you go away!
Go put a down payment on your coffin!
Who threw the firecracker?
I'm one of you, brother.
Mind your own business!
It's raining.
Go bring in your laundry!
Fat woman!
You blackmailing me too?
I ain't afraid.
I...
Did anyone see what happened?
Don't!
My back's broken!
Call for help!
Hold on, calm down.
You hungry?
Keep quiet.
No.
Who did this?
I'll count to three.
One two...
I did it!
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?
Sorry!
Look away, kid.
Get rid of him!
We're the bad guys!
We're meant to do the ass-kicking not the other way around.
And it's all because these morons posed as Axes.
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.
We'll handle this.
You!
Take care of it.
- Boy, can this guy pick locks.
- It's a living.
Give me a break.
Pick that one too, if you're so good.
Come.
I'll count to three.
Hurry!
Ready?
Three!
That's quick!
Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will!
Go on!
Thank you, Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before, you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living!
The streets out there are filled with money and women.
You only need the will and determination to seize the opportunity to win.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone, and we're in the gang.
Then it'll be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars with no ambition.
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'll smash your glasses!
Get lost!
Come here and say that!
- You're really gonna kill someone?
- That's right!
The four-eyes, the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty.
But they're good at kung fu.
- I can do kung fu!
- Oh, yeah?
Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist Palm kung fu?
Hey there, handsome boy.
Stop.
Amazing!
Do you know you have a special aura?
You're so young, but you have the bone structure... and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.
If your chi flow can be channeled, then you will be invincible!
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.
The duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours.
Sure.
This is the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
It's priceless.
But as it's fate, I'll let you have it for $ 10.
BUDDHIST PALM MANUAL
- You gave him your life savings?
- Yes.
I was saving to study to be a doctor or lawyer but this was world peace.
Let go of the girl!
Hey!
It's the Buddhist Palm!
"The 20-Cent Kung Fu Manual. "
You must be loaded.
Have you killed anyone lately?
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
I realized then that good guys never win.
I want to be bad.
I want to be the killer!
- Ice cream!
- Where?
Make mine a vanilla.
Chocolate for me!
What're you looking at?
Never seen free ice cream before?
Look at her run!
You're such kung-fu masters, go take it on the road.
You belong in the circus, not here!
Don't say that, Landlady.
There must be a reason they're here.
Everyone has his reasons.
We don't want to make trouble.
I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.
We'll never hear the end of it.
Why don't you get lost!
Your wife shouldn't be so nasty.
You okay?
Masters.
We have nothing precious to give you but take this as a token of our appreciation.
Thanks for saving us!
Stop the crying.
This isn't a show!
- You're so cold-hearted.
- Talking back to me, eh?
You may know kung fu, but you're still a fairy.
It's no crime to be good at kung fu!
Once a fairy, always a fairy.
Look at you.
What's with the red underwear?
Why not a diaper while you're at it.
What's wrong with red underwear?
Where were you when there was trouble?
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.
Be reasonable!
I'll reason with you.
You owe me three months' rent.
That's $90.
Pay up or pack up!
Don't you worry.
I'll pay it.
Think you're a smartass, Rabbit-Tooth Jane?
What's it to you, tub of lard?
Bitch!
Calm down, Landlady.
This is your fault.
- Are you trying to kill us?
- You're right.
How could you do that?
Shut the hell up!
You think you can out-yell me?
The fat lady can really sing.
Watch this!
What happened?
What do you mean, what happened?
You try it.
- Me?
- Quick!
Sorry!
You okay?
I think you should get closer and take better aim.
Okay?
Okay!
- Who's throwing the handles?
- Handle?
Where's the third knife?
God knows where it went.
Could it be the same one?
Can't be...
- Don't!
- Sorry.
What are you trying to say?
I just remembered I have something to do.
See you!
Uh-oh.
They've seen us!
Stay back!
Don't panic!
Snakes like music.
If I whistle, they won't bite.
Please, no more bright ideas.
Oh, what the hell!
Not you again, asshole!
Get back to your business!
Split up!
Split?
What're you doing here?
Looking for you.
Weren't you hurt?
I'm fine!
How come you always recover so fast?
I don't know.
- Which hospital did you go to?
- Don't remember.
Maybe it's better that way.
Memories can be painful.
To forget may be a blessing!
I never knew you were so deep.
All the sadness one can bear down the river everywhere.
Hey, get out of the way!
Move!
I'll slap you to kingdom come!
Look at those four-eyes carting around a coffin.
What morons!
Don't blame me for making you leave.
We'll let Buddha decide whether you stay or go.
HORRIFICALLY BAD FATE
Have some tea.
We're grateful for some professional help.
We understand the problem.
Twelve Kicks from the Tam School Iron Fist from the Hung School and the Hexagon Staff...
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.
Their warrior days are long over but they're still top fighters.
This job is a great challenge for us.
Now, that's professionalism.
Number One Killers.
Expensive, yes, but worth every penny!
No!
Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer.
He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
Strictly speaking, we're just musicians.
A song that wrenches the heart O where do I find a knowing ear?
Great poem, isn't it?
We'll be saying goodbye soon.
Who knows when we'll see each other again.
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a lot to pack.
You're right.
Twelve Kicks of the Tam School!
Superb attack and defense!
Iron Fist:
Powerful yet delicate.
Topnotch!
Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves.
Mystical!
Till we meet again!
More lipstick!
Stay there, or I'll break you in half.
Sorry, we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material!
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories...
Insulting the Axe Gang!
We'll show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good!
Don't block my view!
Damn!
I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry.
It's nothing!
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry, sorry!
Get out of my way!
Hang in there, Tailor.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the last we'll see of them.
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down!
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
People are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you I can now die in peace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.
Years ago we saw our only son killed in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters and we'll avenge them!
Becoming a top fighter takes time.
Unless you're a natural-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.
It's obvious I'm the one!
Don't think so.
Everyone!
We swore we'd never fight again.
But we broke that promise today.
For your own safety, please all leave!
In great power lies great responsibility.
There's no escaping from it.
Donut, you're hurt bad.
Rest now.
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
I know you, four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-challenged.
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?
Help me!
"Help me!
Help me!" Want to play, punks?
The Dragon Style?
The Tiger Style?
Come down here, and I'll smash your glasses.
Come on!
You know I'd do it, right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes all because of you!
You're a numb-nut!
Follow me!
It's a stickup!
Where's the money?
Where's the money?
What're you looking at?
I'm serious!
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.
The money's in here.
Let go of the girl!
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
Go away!
You're dragging me down!
Go home and raise pigs.
Go, before I kill you.
You!
Whatsyourname!
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!
- For real?
- Someone's waiting for you.
Brother Sum!
One look at you, and I knew you'd do anything.
Right!
You just needed your chance.
Damn right!
We've an assignment for you.
Anything, Brother Sum!
"Research on abnormal people. " What's that?
A mental asylum.
Soldiers!
Boy Scouts!
Tanks!
No worries.
When the Boy Scouts change shifts, you have exactly five minutes.
Follow the arrows on the map.
Go to the last cell and get the man inside there out.
Here's your tools.
What about you guys?
We're your lookouts.
Five minutes.
Hurry!
The world's top killer indeed looks the part!
It's only a title.
Cut the bullshit.
We want two people killed.
Name your price.
Name my what?
I've killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary.
So far, I've never found one.
That's why I stayed inside.
Had I met my match, I'd have been out long ago.
If you find me a worthy opponent I'll do it for free.
No charge!
Do you have someone?
Yes.
Brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge.
But first, will you show us some moves?
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.
You numskulls aren't worthy!
He doesn't look the part.
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'll clean up well.
You sure you got the right guy?
Absolutely.
I swear I did exactly what you told me.
Please show us some moves, Mr. Beast.
Don't make it hard for me!
You dumb or what?
You know what this is, old man?
Ever seen a fist this big?
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!
Really?
Try me, then.
Is he okay?
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
Harder!
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun!
In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
The real masters, together in one room!
Only the world's top killer has such an aura.
Likewise.
Could you two be the fated lovers...?
Paris and Helen of Troy!
A pleasure, indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang and only the Axe Gang.
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
With the Beast here, let's see whose funeral it is!
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you or be killed by you.
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
Piece of cake.
I can handle this.
Good try, but a little off target.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
- Looks like they're not up to it!
- Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
- I'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
- Go to hell!
You!
Come over here.
- Hit him!
- Yes!
- The head!
- Of course!
- Hit him on the head!
- Okay.
- Here's your chance.
- Got it!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
- Hit the shit out of him!
- Right!
- Hit him!
- Hit him!
Beat the shit out of him!
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused!
Wow, that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
No one gets away from me!
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at least he finally made good.
Look at him!
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey, wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
There's no one here!
CHINESE MEDICINE
It's a miracle he lasted this long.
The herbs should help him.
Herbal medicine can only partly help.
The key is his own body structure.
All his bones and tendons are broken.
It's amazing he's recovering so fast.
It can't be possible...
Unless he's...
What's that smell?
You mustn't smoke while you're hurt.
Let me handle this.
This makes no sense.
Who knew the Beast could clear the chi flow and thus unleash the boy's true potential?
We should've guessed.
He is the one!
Is this for real?
You're still alive, you turncoat?
Kill him, men!
What kind of move is that?
Kids' stuff!
If our son were alive, he'd be his age now.
If he studies hard, he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer.
A stuntman, more likely!
Not bad.
Let's go.
I can even stop bullets...
What?
The Toad Style of the Kwan Lun School?
Oh, no!
Remember the Palm move that falls from heaven?
That's the long lost Buddhist Palm.
I surrender!
What kind of move was that?
If you want to learn, I'll teach you.
Master!
Hey!
Tell him not to put snot on the glass.
You two, put your pants on!
No licking if you're not buying!
Kid, you have the bone structure of a kung-fu genius.
World peace is in your hands.
Here's the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
Because it's fate, I'll let you have it for $ 10.
Wait!
You want more...?

I never knew you were so deep.
All the sadness one can bear... down the river everywhere.
Hey, get out of the way!
SING'S SIDEKICK:
Move!
SING:
I'll slap you to kingdom come!
Look at those four-eyes carting around a coffin.
What morons!
LANDLAD Y:
Don't blame me for making you leave.
We'll let Buddha decide
[BELL TOLLING] whether you stay or go.
HORRIFICALLY BAD FATE
Have some tea.
We're grateful for some professional help.
We understand the problem.
Twelve Kicks from the Tam School,
Iron Fist from the Hung School and the Hexagon Staff...
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.
HARPIST 2:
Their warrior days are long over, but they're still top fighters.
This job is a great challenge for us.
Now, that's professionalism.
Number One Killers.
Expensive, yes, but worth every penny!
No!
Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer.
HARPIST 2:
He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
Strictly speaking, we're just musicians.
A song that wrenches the heart O where do I find a knowing ear?
Great poem, isn't it?
[###]
We'll be saying goodbye soon.
Who knows when we'll see each other again.
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a lot to pack.
You're right.
[###]
Twelve Kicks of the Tam School!
Superb attack and defence!
Iron Fist: powerful yet delicate.
Top-notch!
Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves.
Mystical!
ALL:
Till we meet again!
[SHOUTS]
[CLATTERING CAT SCREECHING]
[MUSIC PLAYING ON RECORD PLAYER]
LANDLAD Y:
More lipstick!
[INDISTINCT CHATTERING]
Stay there, or I'll break you in half.
[###]
[###]
[JINGLE]
[###]
Sorry, we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material!
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories...
[###]
Insulting the Axe Gang!
We'll show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
[GRUNTING]
Good!
Good!
Don't block my view!
Damn!
I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here.
Really?
Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry.
It's nothing!
[COUGHS]
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry, sorry!
[LAUGHS]
Get out of my way!
Hang in there, Tailor.
LANDLAD Y:
Be quiet!
[HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMING]
LANDLAD Y:
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
[###]
[GRUNTING]
[GROANING]
[SCREAMING]
[GRUNTING]
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the last we'll see of them.
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down!
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
People are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
[###]
[WOMEN SOBBING]
DONUT:
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you...
I can now die in peace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.
Years ago... we saw our only son killed in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters and we'll avenge them!
Becoming a top fighter takes time.
Unless you're a natural-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.
[GRUNTS]
It's obvious I'm the one!
Don't think so.
Everyone!
We swore we'd never fight again.
But we broke that promise today.
For your own safety, please all leave!
In great power lies great responsibility.
There's no escaping from it.
Donut, you're hurt bad.
Rest now.
[BABBLING]
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
[###]
I know you, four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-challenged.
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.
[GRUNTING]
[HISSING]
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?
Help me!
[GROWLING]
"Help me!
Help me!" Want to play, punks?
The Dragon Style?
The Tiger Style?
Come down here, and I'll smash your glasses.
Come on!
You know I'd do it, right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
[BARKS]
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes... all because of you!
You're a numb-nut!
Follow me!
It's a stickup!
Where's the money?
Where's the money?
What're you looking at?
I'm serious!
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.
[###]
The money's in here.
SING [AS A CHILD]:
Let go of the girl!
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
Go away!
You're dragging me down!
Go home and raise pigs.
Go, before I kill you.
[BAND PLAYING MUSIC]
MAN:
You!
Whatsyourname!
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!
For real?
Someone's waiting for you.
Brother Sum!
One look at you, and I knew you'd do anything.
Right!
You just needed your chance.
Damn right!
We have an assignment for you.
Anything, Brother Sum!
[###]
SING:
"Research on abnormal people." What's that?
A mental asylum.
[ALARM BUZZING]
Soldiers!
Boy Scouts!
SING:
Tanks!
ADVISOR:
No worries.
When the Boy Scouts change shifts, you have exactly five minutes.
Follow the arrows on the map.
Go to the last cell and get the man inside there out.
Here's your tools.
What about you guys?
We're your lookouts.
[WIND WHISTLING]
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
Five minutes.
Hurry!

[GASPS]
[GRUNTS]
[LOCK CLICKS]

[BROTHER SUM YAWNS]
The world's top killer indeed looks the part!
It's only a title.
Cut the bullshit.
We want two people killed.
Name your price.
Name my what?
I've killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary.
So far, I've never found one.
That's why I stayed inside.
Had I met my match, I'd have been out long ago.
If you find me a worthy opponent...
I'll do it for free.
No charge!
[LAUGHING]
Do you have someone?
Yes.
Brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge.
But first, will you show us some moves?
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.
You numskulls aren't worthy!
[SNAPS FINGERS]
He doesn't look the part.
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'll clean up well.
You sure you got the right guy?
Absolutely.
I swear I did exactly what you told me.
Please show us some moves, Mr. Beast.
Don't make it hard for me!
You dumb or what?
You know what this is, old man?
Ever seen a fist this big?
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!
Really?
Try me, then.
Is he okay?
[LAUGHING]
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
[GLASSES SHATTER]
Harder!
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun!
[GUNS COCKING]
[GUNSHOT]
[###]
In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
[SCREAMING]
The real masters, together in one room!
Only the world's top killer has such an aura.
BEAST:
Likewise.
Could you two be the fated lovers...?
Paris...
And Helen of Troy!
A pleasure, indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang... and only the Axe Gang.
[BROTHER SUM LAUGHING]
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
[SNICKERS]
With the Beast here, let's see whose funeral it is!
LANDLAD Y:
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you... or be killed by you.
[LAUGHS]
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
[###]
Piece of cake.
I can handle this.
[BEAST CHUCKLING]
Good try, but a little off target.
[LAUGHING]
[###]
[HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMING]
The Lion's Roar?
[GRUNTING COUGHING]
[CHIMING]
[HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMING]
[GLASS SHATTERING]
[SCREAMS]
BEAST:
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
[GRUNTING]
Looks like they're not up to it!
Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
I'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
Go to hell!
You!
Come over here.
Hit him!
Yes!
The head!
Of course!
Hit him on the head!
Okay.
Here's your chance.
Got it!
Hit him!
Hit him!
Hit the shit out of him!
Right!
Hit him!
Hit him!
Beat the shit out of him!
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused!
[SCREAMING]
[###]
Wow, that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
[GASPING]
No one gets away from me!
[###]
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at least he finally made good.
Look at him!
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey, wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
[###]
There's no one here!
CHINESE MEDICINE
It's a miracle he lasted this long.
The herbs should help him.
Herbal medicine can only partly help.
The key is his own body structure.
All his bones and tendons are broken.
It's amazing he's recovering so fast.
It can't be possible...
Unless he's... [###]
[BANDAGES SNAPPING]
What's that smell?
[ALL SCREAMING]
[###]
SING:
You mustn't smoke while you're hurt.
Let me handle this.
This makes no sense.
Who knew the Beast could clear the chi flow and thus unleash the boy's true potential?
We should've guessed.
He is the one!
[###]
Is this for real?
You're still alive, you turncoat?
Kill him, men!
What kind of move is that?
Kids' stuff!
[###]
If our son were alive, he'd be his age now.
If he studies hard, he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer.
A stuntman, more likely!
[DINGING]
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
Not bad.
Let's go.
I can even stop bullets...
[CROAKS]
[GRUNTS]
[LAUGHING]
[CROAKING]
What?
The Toad Style of the Kwan Lun School?
Oh, no!
[SCREAMING]
[BIRD SCREECHES]
Remember the Palm move that falls from heaven?
That's the long lost Buddhist Palm.
[###]
[SCREAMS]
I surrender!
What kind of move was that?
If you want to learn, I'll teach you.
[CRYING]
Master!
[###]
Hey!
Tell him not to put snot on the glass.
You two, put your pants on!
No licking if you're not buying!
[###]
Kid, you have the bone structure of a kung-fu genius.
World peace is in your hands.
Here's the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
Because it's fate, I'll let you have it for $10.
Wait!
You want more...?

Water ain't free!
You talk a Iot for someone who won't pay his rent.
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.
You think that's a problem?
From now on, no water on Mondays,Wednesdays and Fridays.
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
I just love hearing you fools complain.

We're bad guys.
Making him look good is really bad.

But I Iike you, so just pay me,and I'II take care of it.
No way!
Steady with the axe, boss.Let me talk to him.
I really care for you.
You saw it for yourself.

Why don't you pay up.
Not much.Enough for a drink.
Oh, so it's blackmail!
Boss!
Boss!
Now you're dead!
Looks like he's waking up!
I'm not afraid.
You can kill me.
But there'II be thousands more of me!
You want to play tough?

Whoever wants to die,step forward.

Don't even think about cheating.
That old woman with the onion!
You look real tough.
Want to try me?

I'm a farmer.
Farmers don't fight.
Piss off!
He's crazy!

You're lucky you're a woman.
Hey, shorty!
Yeah, you!
If you're short, you don't retort.
What did I say about cheating?
Sit back down!
You!
The geezer with the gIasses.You look mean.
No, not you.
I mean....
You!
Hey, kid, Iet's rumble!
AII right, all right!
So no one-on-ones today.
You're all such wimps!
He blackmailed me.
Fat woman, you're in charge here, right?
Fat woman, my ass!
I'm with the Axe Gang!
Axe Gang, my ass!
Boss!
Boss, my ass!
You have to pay our medical bills!

We're on the same side!
Same side, my ass!
Think you're so tough?
I'II call for backup!
You nitwit!
Let's see you call backup!
You don't know the backup I have.I'm talking an army here.
Don't you go away!
Go put a down payment on your coffin!
Who threw the firecracker?
I'm one of you, brother.
Mind your own business!
It's raining.
Go bring in your laundry!
Fat woman!
You bIackmaiIing me too?
I ain't afraid.
I....
Did anyone see what happened?
Don't!
My back's broken!
call for help!
hold on, calm down.
You hungry?
Keep quiet.
No.
Who did this?
I'II count to three.
One two....
I did it!
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?
Sorry!
Look away, kid.
Get rid of him!
We're the bad guys!
We're meant to do the ass-kicking not the other way around.
And it's all because these morons posed as Axes.
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.
We'II handle this.
You!
Take care of it.
Boy, can this guy pick Iocks.It's a living.
Give me a break.
Pick that one too, if you're so good.
Come.
I'II count to three.
Hurry!
Ready?
Three!
That's quick!
Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will!
Go on!
Thank you, Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before, you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living!
The streets out there are filled with money and women.
You only need the will and determination to seize the opportunity to win.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone,and we're in the gang.
Then it'II be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars with no ambition.
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'II smash your glasses!
Get lost!
Come here and say that!
You're really gonna kill someone?
That's right!
The four-eyes, the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty.
But they're good at kung fu.
I can do kung fu!
Oh, yeah?
Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist palm kung fu?
Hey there, handsome boy.
Stop.
Amazing!
Do you know you have a special aura?
You're so young, but you have the bone structure... and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.
If your chi flow can be channeled,then you will be invincible!
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.
The duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours.
Sure.
This is the scroll of the Buddhist PaIm.It's priceless.
But as it's fate,I'II let you have it for $ 1 0.
BUDDHIST PALM MANUAL
You gave him your life savings?
Yes.
I was saving to study to be a doctor or lawyer but this was world peace.
Let go of the girl!
Hey!
It's the Buddhist palm!
"The 20-Cent Kung Fu manual."
You must be loaded.
Have you killed anyone lately?
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
I realized then that good guys never win.
I want to be bad.
I want to be the killer!
Ice cream!
Where?
Make mine a vanilla.
chocolate for me!
What're you looking at?
Never seen free ice cream before?
Look at her run!
You're such kung-fu masters,go take it on the road.
You belong in the circus, not here!
Don't say that, LandIady.There must be a reason they're here.
Everyone has his reasons.
We don't want to make trouble.
I'm glad you get it.The mob's mad at us.
We'II never hear the end of it.Why don't you get lost!
Your wife shouIdn't be so nasty.
You okay?
Masters.
We have nothing precious to give you but take this as a token of our appreciation.
Thanks for saving us!
Stop the crying.
This isn't a show!
You're so coId-hearted.TaIking back to me, eh?
You may know kung fu,but you're still a fairy.
It's no crime to be good at kung fu!
Once a fairy, always a fairy.
Look at you.
What's with the red underwear?
Why not a diaper while you're at it.
What's wrong with red underwear?
Where were you when there was trouble?
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.Be reasonable!
I'II reason with you.
You owe me three months' rent.That's $90.
Pay up or pack up!
Don't you worry.
I'II pay it.
Think you're a smartass,Rabbit-Tooth Jane?
What's it to you, tub of lard?
Bitch!
calm down, LandIady.
This is your fault.
Are you trying to kill us?
You're right.
How could you do that?
Shut the hell up!
You think you can out-yeII me?
The fat lady can really sing.
Watch this!
What happened?
What do you mean,what happened?
You try it.
Me?
Quick!
Sorry!
You okay?
I think you should get closer and take better aim.
Okay?
Okay!
Who's throwing the handles?
handle?
Where's the third knife?
God knows where it went.
could it be the same one?
Can't be....
Don't!
Sorry.
What are you trying to say?
I just remembered I have something to do.
See you!
Uh-oh.
They've seen us!
Stay back!
Don't panic!
Snakes like music.If I whistle, they won't bite.
please, no more bright ideas.
Oh, what the hell!
Not you again, asshole!
Get back to your business!
split up!
split?
What're you doing here?
Looking for you.
Weren't you hurt?
I'm fine!
How come you always recover so fast?
I don't know.
Which hospital did you go to?
Don't remember.
Maybe it's better that way.
Memories can be painfuI.To forget may be a blessing!
I never knew you were so deep.
AII the sadness one can bear down the river everywhere.
Hey, get out of the way!
Move!
I'II slap you to kingdom come!
Look at those four-eyes carting around a coffin.
What morons!
Don't blame me for making you leave.
We'II let Buddha decide whether you stay or go.
HORRIFICALLY BAD FATE
Have some tea.
We're grateful for some professional help.
We understand the probIem.TweIve Kicks from the Tam school Iron Fist from the Hung school and the Hexagon Staff....
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.
Their warrior days are long over but they're still top fighters.
This job is a great challenge for us.
Now, that's professionalism.
Number One killers.
Expensive, yes,but worth every penny!
No!
Number one is the Beast,the world's top killer.
He was so dedicated to kung fu,he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
strictly speaking,we're just musicians.
A song that wrenches the heart O where do I find a knowing ear?
Great poem, isn't it?
We'II be saying goodbye soon.
Who knows when we'II see each other again.
We're three of a kind.Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a Iot to pack.
You're right.
twelve Kicks of the Tam school!
Superb attack and defense!
Iron Fist: powerful yet deIicate.Topnotch!
Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves.
mystical!
till we meet again!
More Iipstick!
Stay there, or I'II break you in half.
Sorry, we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material!
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories....

We'II show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good!
Don't block my view!
Damn!
I told those nitwits to leave,but they're still here.

Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'II pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry.
It's nothing!

THE AXE GANG
In a time of social unrest and disorder...
In a time of social unrest and disorder the gangs have moved in to consolidate their power.
The most feared of them all is the Axe Gang.
Only in the poorest districts, which hold no interest for the gangs..

NOODLES AND CONGEE
My check, please, Donut.
-How much?
-It's on the house!
Donut.
-It's nothing.
-I like you.
I'll ask the wife about lowering your rent.
Morning, Landlord!
Landlord!
Jill!
How you've grown!
Come let me examine you!
Good to see you, Landlord!
What's so good about it?
Don't...!
Can you make the skirt slit higher?
Sure!
Look, a comet!
Jane!
You naughty girl!
Landlord!
You're such a scoundrel!
Don't go, Jane!
Stay and chat!
I'm only kidding.
Jane!
Landlady!
Landlady!
What happened to the water?
Water ain't free!
You talk a lot for someone who won't pay his rent.
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.
You think that's a problem?
From now on, no water on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
I just love hearing you fools complain.
Assholes!
Good morning, Landlady!
Just pay your rent, or I'll burn your shop down.
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter, fairy!
Serves you right you're a coolie!
Months overdue and not even a "good morning."
You'll be a coolie for life.
There you go, handsome!
What took you so long with the congee?
I stopped to help an old lady cross the street.
-What are you doing here?
-Checking for Peeping Toms.
Was someone just spying on you, Auntie Six?
Don't shoot your mouth off without proof.
She's crazy.
Go away!
Please can you teach us, sir?
No more soccer!
-Who wants the cut?
-My boss.
Take a seat.
Done!
Fifty cents, please.
Isn't it great?
It's too good!
Why'd you make him look so good?
Why?
Don't get mad, boss.
He's my old buddy.
I'll handle this.
He's boss of the Axe Gang.
Don't you see the two axes?
We're bad guys.
Making him look good is really bad.
Understand?
-I didn't know.
-You're a numskull!
But I like you, so just pay me, and I'll take care of it.
No way!
Steady with the axe, boss.
Let me talk to him.
I really care for you.
You saw it for yourself.
Seriously.
Why don't you pay up.
Not much.
Enough for a drink.
Oh, so it's blackmail!
Boss!
Boss!
Now you're dead!
Looks like he's waking up!
I'm not afraid.
You can kill me.
But there'll be thousands more of me!
You want to play tough?
The Axe Gang boss is napping in there.
Whoever wants to die, step forward.
So you want to fight?
Great!
We'll go one-on-one.
Don't even think about cheating.
That old woman with the onion!
You look real tough.
Want to try me?
I'll let you hit me first.
What do you do?
I'm a farmer.
Farmers don't fight.
Piss off!
He's crazy!
Calling me names?
You're lucky you're a woman.
Hey, shorty!
Yeah, you!
If you're short, you don't retort.
What did I say about cheating?
Sit back down!
You!
The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.
No, not you.
I mean....
You!
Hey, kid, let's rumble!
All right, all right!
So no one-on-ones today.
You're all such wimps!
He blackmailed me.
Fat woman, you're in charge here, right?
Fat woman, my ass!
I'm with the Axe Gang!
Axe Gang, my ass!
Boss!
Boss, my ass!
-You have to pay our medical bills!
-Bills, my ass!
-We're on the same side!
-Same side, my ass!
Think you're so tough?
I'll call for backup!
You nitwit!
Let's see you call backup!
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.
Don't you go away!
Go put a down payment on your coffin!
Who threw the firecracker?
I'm one of you, brother.
Mind your own business!
It's raining.
Go bring in your laundry!
Fat woman!
You blackmailing me too?
I ain't afraid.
I....
Did anyone see what happened?
Don't!
My back's broken!
Call for help!
Hold on, calm down.
You hungry?
Keep quiet.
No.
Who did this?
I'll count to three.
One two....
I did it!
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?
Sorry!
Look away, kid.
Get rid of him!
We're the bad guys!
We're meant to do the ass-kicking not the other way around.
And it's all because these morons posed as Axes.
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.
We'll handle this.
You!
Take care of it.
-Boy, can this guy pick locks.
-It's a living.
Give me a break.
Pick that one too, if you're so good.
Come.
I'll count to three.
Hurry!
Ready?
Three!
That's quick!
Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will!
Go on!
Thank you, Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before, you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living!
The streets out there are filled with money and women.
You only need the will and determination to seize the opportunity to win.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone, and we're in the gang.
Then it'll be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars with no ambition.
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'll smash your glasses!
Get lost!
Come here and say that!
-You're really gonna kill someone?
-That's right!
The four-eyes, the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty.
But they're good at kung fu.
-I can do kung fu!
-Oh, yeah?
Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist Palm kung fu?
Hey there, handsome boy.
Stop.
Amazing!
Do you know you have a special aura?
You're so young, but you have the bone structure... and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.
If your chi flow can be channeled, then you will be invincible!
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.
The duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours.
Sure.
This is the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
It's priceless.
But as it's fate, I'll let you have it for $1 0.

-You gave him your life savings?
-Yes.
I was saving to study to be a doctor or lawyer but this was world peace.
Let go of the girl!
Hey!
It's the Buddhist Palm!
"The 20-Cent Kung Fu Manual."
You must be loaded.
Have you killed anyone lately?
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
I realized then that good guys never win.
I want to be bad.
I want to be the killer!
-lce cream!
-Where?
Make mine a vanilla.
Chocolate for me!
What're you looking at?
Never seen free ice cream before?
Look at her run!
You're such kung-fu masters, go take it on the road.
You belong in the circus, not here!
Don't say that, Landlady.
There must be a reason they're here.
Everyone has his reasons.
We don't want to make trouble.
I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.
We'll never hear the end of it.
Why don't you get lost!
Your wife shouldn't be so nasty.
You okay?
Masters.
We have nothing precious to give you but take this as a token of our appreciation.
Thanks for saving us!
Stop the crying.
This isn't a show!
-You're so cold-hearted.
-Talking back to me, eh?
You may know kung fu, but you're still a fairy.
It's no crime to be good at kung fu!
Once a fairy, always a fairy.
Look at you.
What's with the red underwear?
Why not a diaper while you're at it.
What's wrong with red underwear?
Where were you when there was trouble?
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.
Be reasonable!
I'll reason with you.
You owe me three months' rent.
That's $90.
Pay up or pack up!
Don't you worry.
I'll pay it.
Think you're a smartass, Rabbit-Tooth Jane?
What's it to you, tub of lard?
Bitch!
Calm down, Landlady.
This is your fault.
-Are you trying to kill us?
-You're right.
How could you do that?
Shut the hell up!
You think you can out-yell me?
The fat lady can really sing.
Watch this!
What happened?
What do you mean, what happened?
You try it.
-Me?
-Quick!
Sorry!
You okay?
I think you should get closer and take better aim.
Okay?
Okay!
-Who's throwing the handles?
-Handle?
Where's the third knife?
God knows where it went.
Could it be the same one?
Can't be....
-Don't!
-Sorry.
What are you trying to say?
I just remembered I have something to do.
See you!
Uh-oh.
They've seen us!
Stay back!
Don't panic!
Snakes like music.
If I whistle, they won't bite.
Please, no more bright ideas.
Oh, what the hell!
Not you again, asshole!
Get back to your business!
Split up!
Split?
What're you doing here?
Looking for you.
Weren't you hurt?
I'm fine!
How come you always recover so fast?
I don't know.
-Which hospital did you go to?
-Don't remember.
Maybe it's better that way.
Memories can be painful.
To forget may be a blessing!
I never knew you were so deep.
All the sadness one can bear down the river everywhere.
Hey, get out of the way!
Move!
I'll slap you to kingdom come!
Look at those four-eyes carting around a coffin.
What morons!
Don't blame me for making you leave.
We'll let Buddha decide whether you stay or go.
HORRlFlCALLY BAD FATE
Have some tea.
We're grateful for some professional help.
We understand the problem.
Twelve Kicks from the Tam School Iron Fist from the Hung School and the Hexagon Staff....
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.
Their warrior days are long over but they're still top fighters.
This job is a great challenge for us.
Now, that's professionalism.
Number One Killers.
Expensive, yes, but worth every penny!
No!
Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer.
He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
Strictly speaking, we're just musicians.
A song that wrenches the heart O where do I find a knowing ear?
Great poem, isn't it?
We'll be saying goodbye soon.
Who knows when we'll see each other again.
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a lot to pack.
You're right.
Twelve Kicks of the Tam School!
Superb attack and defense!
Iron Fist: powerful yet delicate.
Topnotch!
Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves.
Mystical!
Till we meet again!
More lipstick!
Stay there, or I'll break you in half.
Sorry, we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material!
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories....
Insulting the Axe Gang!
We'll show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good!
Don't block my view!
Damn!
I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here.
-Really?
-Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry.
It's nothing!
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry, sorry!
Get out of my way!
Hang in there, Tailor.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the last we'll see of them.
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down!
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
People are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you I can now die in peace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.
Years ago we saw our only son killed in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters and we'll avenge them!
Becoming a top fighter takes time.
Unless you're a natural-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.
It's obvious I'm the one!
Don't think so.
Everyone!
We swore we'd never fight again.
But we broke that promise today.
For your own safety, please all leave!
In great power lies great responsibility.
There's no escaping from it.
Donut, you're hurt bad.
Rest now.
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
I know you, four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-challenged.
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?
Help me!
"Help me!
Help me!" Want to play, punks?
The Dragon Style?
The Tiger Style?
Come down here, and I'll smash your glasses.
Come on!
You know I'd do it, right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes all because of you!
You're a numb-nut!
Follow me!
It's a stickup!
Where's the money?
Where's the money?
What're you looking at?
I'm serious!
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.
The money's in here.
Let go of the girl!
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
Go away!
You're dragging me down!
Go home and raise pigs.
Go, before I kill you.
You!
Whatsyourname!
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!
-For real?
-Someone's waiting for you.
Brother Sum!
One look at you, and I knew you'd do anything.
Right!
You just needed your chance.
Damn right!
We've an assignment for you.
Anything, Brother Sum!
"Research on abnormal people." What's that?
A mental asylum.
Soldiers!
Boy Scouts!
Tanks!
No worries.
When the Boy Scouts change shifts, you have exactly five minutes.
Follow the arrows on the map.
Go to the last cell and get the man inside there out.
Here's your tools.
What about you guys?
We're your lookouts.
Five minutes.
Hurry!
The world's top killer indeed looks the part!
It's only a title.
Cut the bullshit.
We want two people killed.
Name your price.
Name my what?
I've killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary.
So far, I've never found one.
That's why I stayed inside.
Had I met my match, I'd have been out long ago.
If you find me a worthy opponent I'll do it for free.
No charge!
Do you have someone?
Yes.
Brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge.
But first, will you show us some moves?
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.
You numskulls aren't worthy!
He doesn't look the part.
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'll clean up well.
You sure you got the right guy?
Absolutely.
I swear I did exactly what you told me.
Please show us some moves, Mr. Beast.
Don't make it hard for me!
You dumb or what?
You know what this is, old man?
Ever seen a fist this big?
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!
Really?
Try me, then.
Is he okay?
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
Harder!
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun!
In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
The real masters, together in one room!
Only the world's top killer has such an aura.
Likewise.
Could you two be the fated lovers...?
Paris and Helen of Troy!
A pleasure, indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang and only the Axe Gang.
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
With the Beast here, let's see whose funeral it is!
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you or be killed by you.
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
Piece of cake.
I can handle this.
Good try, but a little off target.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
-Looks like they're not up to it!
-Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
-I'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
-Go to hell!
You!
Come over here.
-Hit him!
-Yes!
-The head!
-Of course!
-Hit him on the head!
-Okay.
-Here's your chance.
-Got it!
-Hit him!
-Hit him!
-Hit the shit out of him!
-Right!
-Hit him!
-Hit him!
Beat the shit out of him!
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused!
Wow, that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
No one gets away from me!
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at least he finally made good.
Look at him!
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey, wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
There's no one here!
chinese medicine
It's a miracle he lasted this long.
The herbs should help him.
Herbal medicine can only partly help.
The key is his own body structure.
All his bones and tendons are broken.
It's amazing he's recovering so fast.
It can't be possible....
Unless he's....
What's that smell?
You mustn't smoke while you're hurt.
Let me handle this.
This makes no sense.
Who knew the Beast could clear the chi flow and thus unleash the boy's true potential?
We should've guessed.
He is the one!
Is this for real?
You're still alive, you turncoat?
Kill him, men!
What kind of move is that?
Kids' stuff!
If our son were alive, he'd be his age now.
If he studies hard, he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer.
A stuntman, more likely!
Not bad.
Let's go.
I can even stop bullets--
What?
The Toad Style of the Kwan Lun School?
Oh, no!
Remember the Palm move that falls from heaven?
That's the long lost Buddhist Palm.
I surrender!
What kind of move was that?
If you want to learn, I'll teach you.
Master!
Hey!
Tell him not to put snot on the glass.
You two, put your pants on!
No licking if you're not buying!
Kid, you have the bone structure of a kung-fu genius.
World peace is in your hands.
Here's the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
Because it's fate, I'll let you have it for $1 0.
Wait!
You want more...?

Don't bother with that, Crocodile.
While you were chatting with the law your men, decided they'd rather sign up with us.
That's what you think!
Go on my boys, riddle his ass.
Wait just a minute.
Remember when you came to my house for dinner.
Hey Boss.

Please don't hurt me.
Not to worry.
I would never harm a, Lady.

Water doesn't just fall from the clouds you know!
You've got a pretty big mouth for someone who's four months behind on his rent.
I was right in the middle of my monthly shampoo.
I have a right to wash my hair.
Oh you are a trouble maker?
From now on, no water on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
And I'm rationing it, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays and that's, that.
I'v had it with your whining and complaining.
want everything free around here, assholes!
Is it late for a good morning, Landlady!
Don't sweet talk me you worm.
You catch up on your rent or I'll burn your store down.
What?
What's so funny?
The same thing applies to you, you little faggot!
all might and know brains!
why don't you get yoursef a real job
Months overdue and not even a lousy "good morning."
You're gonna end up being a coolie your whole life.
There's your shampoo, you little prick!
Hey!
I wanted those for breakfast, not for dinner
You see, there was this old women and I helped her across the street.
- And what are you doing here?
- Someone was complaining about perverts
Watching the girls shower.
Did you see anyone?
What?
don't point at me, you have know proof, empty baseless accusations.
She is totally crazy.
Completely of her rocking chair
Go away!
Can you teach me how to do that, sir?
Sure, lesson one!
- Who do I do?
- My boss.
Have a seat.
- There!
That's, fifty cents.
- Are you kidding
A perfect little trim?
It's too stylish!
Makes him look way to slick.
Like a fruit cake?
Don't get all worked up, boss.
He's an old buddy.
Let me handle this.
He's boss of the notorious, Axe Gang, see the tatoos on him?
He'll kill us.
Chiefs who command respect, should look like they come from the gutter, got that?
- No.
- Course not, you're an idiotl!
But I like you, so give me what's in the till and we'll call it even.
No uh-huh!
whoa, hold the axes boss!
He's about to see the light.
Look, kid I'm on your side, I'd hate to see your face get pushed in.
So how about we settle for a little less.
Let's make it, enough for a couple of drinks.
Ah-ha, so your thing is extortion
Hey boss!
Boss, your highness!
Oh he always does that, right before he butchers someone!
He's thinking about the coolest way to do it!
I am not afraid.
You may kill me.
But thousands more will spring up in my place.
You out there?
If you want to wake the lord of the, Axe Gang, your welcome to take a step forward.
Oh, so you want to be annihilated?
Alright!
You all know the rules.
It's one at a time.
And I don't wanna see anyone trying to cheat.
You!

Uh-huh, you think your so tough.
I'll tell you what, you take the first crack, put it right here!
Do you lift weights?
No honey, I raise cattle.

You watch your mouth.
I like your style, you're a woman.
Otherwise.
You with your mouth hanging open?

You look like, you could use some sense knocked into your head, you wanna try.
Okay, if there's one thing that really bugs the hell outta me?
It's cheating.
Sit!

Come here.
Whoa, whoa back off, who ever asked you, I was pointing at him over there...
You!
Karate kid.
You look okay, lets see what you've got!
Nah, nah it's okay, I don't give lessons.
What this can't be true.
Not one of you is worth the effort.
You'll all be dead before I'll even touch you.
That's the one who tried to blackmail me.
So fat woman, are you the boss around here or what?
Fat woman, my ass!
Hey, I'm with the Axe Gang!

You just wait?
I'll call for backup!
Like anybody will back you up, You nit-wit!
I can hardly wait.
My forces are waiting, this will be the signal to charge.
They'll kick your ass you might aswell go by yourself a coffin.
Who threw the firecracker?
Thanks for coming, brother.
She did
What are you all gaping at!
It's going to rain.
Go get your laundry off the line!
You!
Are you trying to blackmail me aswell.
Just forget it.
Wh...
How did I get in this barrel?
does anybody know.
My back, it's broken!
The gang, call the gang!
Easy how about a snack?
maybe some, egg rolls.
Shut up, silence.
No.
Okay, who did this?
I'll will count to three.
One... two...
It was me!
How's the stuff big, boss?
Sorry, big boss!
No big deal, don't worry about it, kid.
Feed him to the fish!
We are the bad guys!
we're meant to do the killing.
And not the other way around...
Our reputation has been tarnished.
Because these two idiots pretended to be members of the axe gang.
Easy big boss you are all upset you might miss, and get even angrier.
Anyhow you are the boss here. let your men do the dirty work.
Do the dirty work, come on.
- Boss, we got a lock picker here.
- Sorry that's what I do for a living.
Alright give the other one a shot, if your so hot.
On your marks.
Now, you'll have till I count to three.
Chop, chop!
Ready?
Three!
I am impressed!
Boss, I have always wanted to be a member, of the famous, axe gang.
Please give us a chance, boss..
Ever killed anybody?
Not yet, no.
But I always wanted to.
Then go out and kill someone.
That sounds like a great idea, doesn't it?
Then go!
Thank you, so much.
A bum like that, can always come in handy.
I'v told you a hundred times, you have to look tougher.
No, much more than that!
You have to really act the part.
And try to stay awake for once.
Tough, is tiring.
So what, that is part of the job!
Take a look around you, the streets are paved with money and women.
A little will and determination... is all it takes to get your share.
But you have to grab the opportunity.
This is our big chance!
All we have to do is kill someone, and we'll be like that.
Then we'll have all the women and money we want!
Not like those bums back there...
They have no ambition.
No future, a bunch of losers.
What are you staring at, four-eyes?
want me to smash your glasses!
Hey go to hell!
I dare you to say that again!
- You're really going to kill someone?
- Ofcourse I will, I'm!
Gonna start with four-eyes over here, then the fat lady up in pig-sty and all her neighbours.
Yes but they kung-fu is unbeatable.
- Unbeatable?
you havn't seen me fight yet!
- You know, kung-fu?
Didn't I tell you, I once learnt the technique of, Buddhist Palm?
Hey there, young man.
Wait a minute.
whoa, amazing!
amazing!
Do you know you have a very special, aura about you?
You're still a child, but you have the bone structure... and the, chi-flow of a kung-fu genius.
If your chi-flow can be channelled, then you will be invincible!
Remember the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.
The duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil, will be yours.
Uh-humm.
Here, the Buddhist Palm manual of training.
It's priceless, but since this is fate, I can let you have it for $10.
BUDDHIST PALM MANUAL
- You gave him all the money you had?
- Yes.
I had been saving it so I could become a Surgeon or a Lawyer one day.
...but this seemed like a chance to save the world.
Let her go!
Oh, do it yourself Kung-Fu!
"The whole, Buddhist Palm, for 20-Cents."
You must be loaded.
Have you killed anyone lately?
The total idiot and the deaf mute.
What a bunch of losers!
I realized then that good guys never win.
I want to be evil.
I want to be a ruthless killer!
- Lets get some, ice cream!
- Where?
Wait do you have, vanilla?
I want chocolate!
What's the matter, have you never seen an ice cream thief?
Catch us if you can!
If you're such kung-fu masters, take your show on the road.
You belong in the circus, not in a respectable neighbourhood, I never want to see your ugly faces again.
Don't be so hard on them.
I'm sure they had a reason for doing what they did.
Everyone has his reasons.
But causing trouble was the last thing we wanted.
Well good for you, the axe gang is serious.
We'll never hear the end of this.
Why don't you clowns just get lost!
Why is it that your wife is always so nasty.
Like a little massage?
Masters.
We have nothing precious to offer but our gratitude is infinite.
Thank you for saving us!
Stop snivelling.
This isn't a funeral!
- How can you be so cold-hearted.
- What's that?
keep your mouth shut.
You may be good at kung-fu, but you're still a fairy.
Is it a crime to know, kung-fu!
Oh, she's gonna drown in her own tears, once a panzy always a panzy.
And what's with the red underwear?
is that something you can find in the night?
You'd be better off in diapers.
What's wrong with, red underwear?
When their was trouble you simply took off, while these guys saved our butts?
and now your trying to chase them away, I'm gratefull and you should try to be more,
- appreciative.
- Of what
Every single one of you owes me back-rent. $150, $200, $180.
You owe me $95, now pay up or pack up!
Don't worry guys.
I'll pay the bill.
With what?
tooth fairy?
What's it to you where I get my money?
You fat-so.
- You little bitch!
- Look who's talking
Calm down, Landlady.
- You keep out of this, this is all your fault.
- Your like a tyrant
Look at her, she's turned her back.
She doesn't care.
How could you do that?
Shut your mouth!
Anyone who thinks they can out yell me, had better think again?
The fat cow makes alot of noise, I'm going to kill her.
Watch this!
What happened?
Can you do better?
go on try it.
- To throw it?
- Ofcourse!
Sorry!
Are you okay?
I think you should try to go a little bit closer and take better aim.
I got it!
- Who's throwing handles?
- Uhh?
Who did this to you?
It's missing a handle.
I know but that doesn't make it feel any better.
We should check for finger prints, let's have a look...
- Don't!
- I'm sorry.
What are you trying to say?
I forgot that I have something important to take care off, see you later!
Uh-no.
She saw me!
Don't make a move!
Don't panic!
Snakes are controllable, one little whistle and they will freeze.
Please, spare me that.
Oh, what the hell!
Uh, you again, you pair of idiots!
Go on, get back to business!
What are you standing around here for.
- Let's split up!
- Split what?
Yes!
What are you doing here?
Waiting for you.
Aren't you hurt?
I'm fine!
Where are the wounds?
Did you see a doctor?
No, why?
- Where have you been?
- I don't really know.
Maybe it's better that way.
Memories can be terribly painful.
Being able to forget is a great blessing!
That's quite deep.
You seemed to have learnt alot.
All the sorrows I've had to endure...
I've filled a river, now all thoughts are sacred and pure.
Hey, get out of the way!
Yeah move!
Or I will kick your ass!
They look like grave diggers taking one of their customers for a walk.
What idiots!
I don't want to be blamed for making you leave.
So we will let, Buddha decide, with your ancestors spirits as witness...
It's all in the divining rods.
Good stick you stay, bad stick you go.
HORRIFICALLY BAD FATE
Have some.
We are very glad that you have come.
We need some professional advice.
We know what your problems are.
One is from the, Hung school.
They call him the, Iron Fist, those people on pig-sty alley, are really good.
The other two are specialists of the, Twelve Kicks and Hexagon Staff.
But their warrior days are long over.
...Yet, Kung-Fu masters of their level never seize to be a threat.
Which makes this job that you have asked us to perform for you, a great challenge for us.
What more can we ask?
I told you, these guys are number one, expensive but totally reliable, they are worth every penny they charge.
No!
The beast is number one, the evil spirit of the fire cloud is the world's greatest killer.
He was so dedicated to practising kung fu, that he lost his mind.
I have heard that he is held in an asylum for the criminally insane.
Which makes you the top killers in circultion, right?
In actuality, we are nothing more than a pair of street musicians.
Our tunes will take hold of your soul, and then slowly break your heart?
Great, oh that's like poetry?
Don't you agree.
My friends, it is time to part.
I hope we will meet again someday.
I wish, I had known we were colleagues.
I could have done with some company.
Before we go our separate ways, why don't we spar a little.
No thank you.
I still have lots of packing to take care of.
- Yeah, we all do.
- Right.
Twelve Kicks of the, Tam School!
Superb attack and defense!
The, Fist of Iron strong and subtle at once.
A great Fist technique.
The, Woolang Staff, a many sided technique of, mystical powers!
Until we shall meet again!
Lipstick again!
Stay here, or I will break you in half.
Sorry, but I am just closing up.
You can make a suit in no time.
But I am moving away.
This is good material!
Ah, I see you know your cloth.
This is very high quality.
How high?
How high is the sky...
We'll show them what it means to insult the Axe Gang!
We will kill them and turn this place into a, whore house.
You are blocking my view!
What's going on?
Ahh, forget it.
Bullseye!
Do not block my view!
Damn it!
I told those nit-wits to leave, but they are still here.
- Really?
- They are.
What the hell is all that racket down there?
I got....
I'm Sorry, don't pay any attention to her!
It's 4 'oclock, I want to get some sleep.
Get out of here.
Shut up you, hag.
It's time to die!
Die, my ass.
Don't listen to her!
You are still blocking the view!
Hang in there.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Get out of here.
Are you trying to kill us all.
- The view
- I sense another master?
It was the Roar, The Lion's Roar!
I thought it was a myth.
- Why didn't you tell me that it really exists
- Shut up.
- That is the last we will see of them, right?
- hmm.
This is bad, boss. get the car started, quick!
I told you to get...
What now!
Keep it down!
Don't you have any manners?
These is a working class neighbourhood, people have to be at work late.
So get the hell out of my sight!
Right now!
What a bunch of, hoodlums!
It is no use, I cannot hold out much longer.
But having met, true...
Masters like you I can now die in peace.
Don't say things like that, Donut.
We are just an ordinary couple, that is trying to live in peace.
Fighting is futile.
Where as a normal life, is all that one should aspire to.
But you are so good at martial arts!
If only you'd helped us earlier, all this would never have happened..
Everybody has his good reasons.
Several years ago, my poor husband and I we saw our only son beaten to death in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand what I am saying?
There is only one solution to the matter, you must teach us all that you know...
Help us become Kung-Fu fighters and we will avenge them!
But it takes years to reach the top.
Being a fighter is not easy.
Either you are born with a calling or you are not.
And the chances of that are about, one in a million.
It is obvious, I am the chosen one!
No, doesn't have what it takes.
Listen!
We swore that we would never fight again.
That we would rest our skills forever.
Tonight we broke that solemn promise.
For your own good, why don't you all just all go away.
With great power, comes great responsibility.
Donut, you are badly hurt.
You must keep still.
This could be the end of a beautifull... friendship.
No Donut, tomorrow is another day.
Donut!
Hey there, four-eyes!
I note that your tolerence for the sight-impaired is rather limited.
That's right.
Especially when they wearing gold-frames.
I'm a clerk.
Gold frames look good on clerks, I like.
the way I look.
So don't hassle me you little fool.
Help me!
Alley cats, mongrels, dogs, rats.
So much for your... so-so-so-so.
Come down here, and I'll shove your glasses down your throat, you hear me.
You know damn well that I would have done that.
Was that a yes!
I would have!
You have no respect.
Your never there when I need you?
You sound like a wimp!
Because of you we're always getting beaten up.
We have nothing to show, no murder, no rapes, no arson, no theft.
No nothing...
I know all that because you can't get your fat ass in gear.
What have I done to deserve you as a partner!
Lets go!
This is a stickup!
Where is the money?
Where is the money?
Give it to me
Don't look at me like that I mean it!
I have killed people for less!
Now get the money.
Go on!
It's in here.
Let her go!
A total idiot and a deaf mute!
What a bunch of losers.
Leave me alone!
your just dead weight!
Here take this.
Go home and raise pigs.
That is where you belong.
Go on, before I kill you.
Hey kid!
Hey what's your name!
There you go, buy yourself some new clothes.
You're now a member of, The Axe gang!
- Are you serious?
- Yes and there's someone back here waiting for you.
Brother Sum!
When I first saw you, I knew you'd be a courageous man of many talents.
Aha!
Looking for an opportunity.
Right!
I have an assignment for you.
For you I would eat fire!
"Research for abnormal development." What's that?
A nut-house, for crazies.
What is the army doing there!
those are not soldiers.
They, Boy Scouts!
With tanks!
Forget it, they are just models.
Now when those scouts change the guards, five minutes is all you will have.
You must follow these arrows.
to the last cell. when you find it...
Force the door and get the man in there out.
Here's your tool kit, five minutes.
Now go!
What about you?
We will be your lookouts, ofcourse.
You have five minutes.
Get on with it!
The world's finest killer, the Beast himself is clearly dressed to suit his reputation!
That is only a label.
Do not worry.
We want two people killed and your the one who's going to do it.
Now what do you charge.
What do I charge?
I've killed so many over the years so many just trying to find a worthy adversary.
That's why I stay in my cell, because there was know one out there.
I would have escaped long ago if I had found someone...
If you find me such an opponent.
Then young friend.
I will make you an offer you cannot refuse.
...I will do it for free.
Do you have someone?
Yes.
We have just what you are looking for, the very best.
This is gonna be the fight of the century.
Would you mind demonstrating some of your technique.
Not that we don't trust you.
We just want to see what we are buying.
You fools are not worthy.
I am just wasting my time here.
- Yes boss
- He looks like refuge.
I agree, those sandals look totally worn out.
But a change of clothes will make him look,
- quite respectable.
- Are you sure you brought the right one?
Oh yes boss, I am certain.
I swear I followed your order to the letter.
Mr Beast, please show us a sample of your technique.
My careers on the line.
What do I care.
Okay old man, you see this?
Have you ever gone up against a fist this big,
I am almost afraid to use it?
Do you realise the danger your in.
Really?
Try me, then.
See what I mean, is he conscious.
Aha, and you say you can fight?
Harder!
Harder!
Much harder!
If that is all you have to offer, how can you call yourself a gangster?
Do they make this for men!
In the world of kung-fu, speed determines the winner.
That leaves no doubt, about who our honoured guest is.
Your skill is unique.
The Axe Gang offers its respect!
The three true masters of, kung-fu!
Only the world's top killer, exerts an honour like that it crouds the air.
And what is that other aura telling me.
Am I looking at the legendary tragic couple.
The great...
Young Beau...
I'm the dragons daughter!
It is a great honour to be here.
We have come to eliminate, The Axe Gang and only the Axe Gang.
You should've killed me while you had the chance.
But it is too late, now that you are here you are doomed to die.
You are living on borrowed time.
Your fate is sealed.
We brought you a gift you cannot refuse!
What is this?
A funeral bell?
Ha.
With the beast on our side, we shall see for whom the bell tolls.
Are you here on their behalf?
Don't misunderstand me.
The only thing I'm here for, is to kill the two of you or for you to kill me, if you have what it takes.
What is your opinion, dear?
In this world good cannot exist, along side with evil.
Such is destiny.
Then that is the decision.
Shall we.
Okay.
Let's dance!
That's okay for starters.
Now let's try again.
That was much better, but you are still lacking precision.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
Know body told me the, Lion's Roar could be done through a loud speaker!
I concede my defeat!
Looks like his not upto it. this is our big chance.
Get them while they are down.
You do it!
- I'm gonna be sick.
I need a doctor!
- Go to hell!
You!
Come here.
- Hit him!
- Okay!
- On the head!
- Yes sir!
- Hit him on the head!
- Okay.
- Now's your chance.
- Right!
- Go on!
- I will!
- Smash him on the head!
- I will!
- On the head!
- I will!
Beat him to a pulp!
What was that?
Do you want me to beat him to a pulp, or just smash him on the head?
You are totally confusing me!
Wow.
A pretty big fist you have there.
Carefull with that!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
They are gone.
Your completely useless.
You let them get away?
I cannot be defeated.
Not in this world.
Why did he try to save us?
These young people often make mistakes when they are starting out.
We must forgive them, if they make good in the end.
Just look!
Beaten to a pulp.
The poor boy.
Do you have a last request?
just tell us.
Wait, wait!
What are you writing.
I do not know this character.
I cannot understand.
Wait, wait.
No one here!
CHINESE MEDICINE
It is truly a miracle, he has survived this long.
Your herbs are playing their part.
The herbs will help him along.
But the key lies within his own body.
All his bones are broken.
His tendons torn.
It is amazing, he is recovering so quickly.
Under normal circumstances this would be impossible, unless...
Unless of course...
You smell that?
You must not smoke while you are injured.
Let me deal with this.
This makes no sense.
Who would ever have thought.
That the boy's chi-flo would be released by, the Beast's thrashing.
Right, still we should have noticed earlier.
That he may be the greatest, kung-fu genius to ever come along!
I wonder what I'd be up to next?
So you're still alive, you traitor?
Axes, forward!
The toe crusher.
That went out of style when I left kindergarten.
Our son would have been, just about his age now.
If he is willing to make the effort, he could surely become a doctor or a lawyer.
More likely a great, kung-fu fighter.
Not bad.
Now what.
Childs play.
I can stop bullets...
Huh.
Isn't that the, Toad technique of the, Kwan Lun?
I'm afraid so.
Do you, remember the buddhist technique of the, Palm descending from heaven?
The long lost art, we all thought was forever gone.
I surrender!
What's the name of your technique?
Do you want to learn.
I will teach you.
Master!
Hey!
Tell your son not to smear his snot on the glass.
You two.
Don't put your pants down in here!
Hey if your licking, you have to buy it.
Sonny, you have the structure of the chi-flo of a kung-fu genius.
Upholding world peace is in your hands.
The Buddhist Palm manual.
Since it's fate, you can have it for $10.
Wait!
You don't follow the Palm method, try one of these.
Pick a manual, any manual.

SUPER CRIME FIGHTERS
Anyone else?
Such a beautiful woman and you arrest her just for spitting?
Is there no justice?
Is there no law?
Commissioner is only your boss because he paid his dues to the Crocodile Gang.
And you don't fucking know me?
Sorry, I didn't know she was your wife.
Ugly coward!
What are you looking at?
Never seen such a handsome gang boss?
Who'd be in the film business?
It's Sunday, and the theater's deserted.
Where's the car?
Let's go back inside!
Call for help!
No need for that, Northerner.
While you were messing with the cop, your men signed up with us.
I'll kill all you Axe Gangsters!
Stop!
You forget the time I treated you to dinner.
Brother Sum.
Please....
Please spare me.
Don't worry.
I don't kill women.
You can go!
Thank you, Big Brother.
Cops!
Come clean up the mess!
THE AXE GANG
In a time of social unrest and disorder...
In a time of social unrest and disorder the gangs have moved in to consolidate their power.
The most feared of them all is the Axe Gang.
Only in the poorest districts, which hold no interest for the gangs..

NOODLES AND CONGEE
My check, please, Donut.
-How much?
-It's on the house!
Donut.
-It's nothing.
-I like you.
I'll ask the wife about lowering your rent.
Morning, Landlord!
Landlord!
Jill!
How you've grown!
Come let me examine you!
Good to see you, Landlord!
What's so good about it?
Don't...!
Can you make the skirt slit higher?
Sure!
Look, a comet!
Jane!
You naughty girl!
Landlord!
You're such a scoundrel!
Don't go, Jane!
Stay and chat!
I'm only kidding.
Jane!
Landlady!
Landlady!
What happened to the water?
Water ain't free!
You talk a lot for someone who won't pay his rent.
But I'm in the middle of a shampoo.
You think that's a problem?
From now on, no water on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
Water ration Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
I just love hearing you fools complain.
Assholes!
Good morning, Landlady!
Just pay your rent, or I'll burn your shop down.
What's so funny?
Rent's no laughing matter, fairy!
Serves you right you're a coolie!
Months overdue and not even a "good morning."
You'll be a coolie for life.
There you go, handsome!
What took you so long with the congee?
I stopped to help an old lady cross the street.
-What are you doing here?
-Checking for Peeping Toms.
Was someone just spying on you, Auntie Six?
Don't shoot your mouth off without proof.
She's crazy.
Go away!
Please can you teach us, sir?
No more soccer!
-Who wants the cut?
-My boss.
Take a seat.
Done!
Fifty cents, please.
Isn't it great?
It's too good!
Why'd you make him look so good?
Why?
Don't get mad, boss.
He's my old buddy.
I'll handle this.
He's boss of the Axe Gang.
Don't you see the two axes?
We're bad guys.
Making him look good is really bad.
Understand?
-I didn't know.
-You're a numskull!
But I like you, so just pay me, and I'll take care of it.
No way!
Steady with the axe, boss.
Let me talk to him.
I really care for you.
You saw it for yourself.
Seriously.
Why don't you pay up.
Not much.
Enough for a drink.
Oh, so it's blackmail!
Boss!
Boss!
Now you're dead!
Looks like he's waking up!
I'm not afraid.
You can kill me.
But there'll be thousands more of me!
You want to play tough?
The Axe Gang boss is napping in there.
Whoever wants to die, step forward.
So you want to fight?
Great!
We'll go one-on-one.
Don't even think about cheating.
That old woman with the onion!
You look real tough.
Want to try me?
I'll let you hit me first.
What do you do?
I'm a farmer.
Farmers don't fight.
Piss off!
He's crazy!
Calling me names?
You're lucky you're a woman.
Hey, shorty!
Yeah, you!
If you're short, you don't retort.
What did I say about cheating?
Sit back down!
You!
The geezer with the glasses.
You look mean.
No, not you.
I mean....
You!
Hey, kid, let's rumble!
All right, all right!
So no one-on-ones today.
You're all such wimps!
He blackmailed me.
Fat woman, you're in charge here, right?
Fat woman, my ass!
I'm with the Axe Gang!
Axe Gang, my ass!
Boss!
Boss, my ass!
-You have to pay our medical bills!
-Bills, my ass!
-We're on the same side!
-Same side, my ass!
Think you're so tough?
I'll call for backup!
You nitwit!
Let's see you call backup!
You don't know the backup I have.
I'm talking an army here.
Don't you go away!
Go put a down payment on your coffin!
Who threw the firecracker?
I'm one of you, brother.
Mind your own business!
It's raining.
Go bring in your laundry!
Fat woman!
You blackmailing me too?
I ain't afraid.
I....
Did anyone see what happened?
Don't!
My back's broken!
Call for help!
Hold on, calm down.
You hungry?
Keep quiet.
No.
Who did this?
I'll count to three.
One two....
I did it!
Are the goods okay, Brother Sum?
Sorry!
Look away, kid.
Get rid of him!
We're the bad guys!
We're meant to do the ass-kicking not the other way around.
And it's all because these morons posed as Axes.
Don't waste your time, Brother Sum.
We'll handle this.
You!
Take care of it.
-Boy, can this guy pick locks.
-It's a living.
Give me a break.
Pick that one too, if you're so good.
Come.
I'll count to three.
Hurry!
Ready?
Three!
That's quick!
Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes.
That's why we did what we did.
Give us a chance.
Ever killed anyone?
I've always thought about it.
Then go kill someone.
I will!
Go on!
Thank you, Brother Sum.
We can always find a use for that type.
I told you before, you've got to look tough.
Tougher!
Tougher!
Act the part.
And try to stay awake.
It's tiring being tough.
Tiring?
It's our living!
The streets out there are filled with money and women.
You only need the will and determination to seize the opportunity to win.
This is our big chance!
We just kill someone, and we're in the gang.
Then it'll be money and women all the way!
Don't be like those beggars with no ambition.
Who are you looking at, four-eyes?
I'll smash your glasses!
Get lost!
Come here and say that!
-You're really gonna kill someone?
-That's right!
The four-eyes, the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty.
But they're good at kung fu.
-I can do kung fu!
-Oh, yeah?
Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist Palm kung fu?
Hey there, handsome boy.
Stop.
Amazing!
Do you know you have a special aura?
You're so young, but you have the bone structure... and chi flow of a kung-fu genius.
If your chi flow can be channeled, then you will be invincible!
Like the old saying:
You cannot escape your destiny.
The duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours.
Sure.
This is the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
It's priceless.
But as it's fate, I'll let you have it for $1 0.
buddhist PALM MANUAL
-You gave him your life savings?
-Yes.
I was saving to study to be a doctor or lawyer but this was world peace.
Let go of the girl!
Hey!
It's the Buddhist Palm!
"The 20-Cent Kung Fu Manual."
You must be loaded.
Have you killed anyone lately?
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
I realized then that good guys never win.
I want to be bad.
I want to be the killer!
-lce cream!
-Where?
Make mine a vanilla.
Chocolate for me!
What're you looking at?
Never seen free ice cream before?
Look at her run!
You're such kung-fu masters, go take it on the road.
You belong in the circus, not here!
Don't say that, Landlady.
There must be a reason they're here.
Everyone has his reasons.
We don't want to make trouble.
I'm glad you get it.
The mob's mad at us.
We'll never hear the end of it.
Why don't you get lost!
Your wife shouldn't be so nasty.
You okay?
Masters.
We have nothing precious to give you but take this as a token of our appreciation.
Thanks for saving us!
Stop the crying.
This isn't a show!
-You're so cold-hearted.
-Talking back to me, eh?
You may know kung fu, but you're still a fairy.
It's no crime to be good at kung fu!
Once a fairy, always a fairy.
Look at you.
What's with the red underwear?
Why not a diaper while you're at it.
What's wrong with red underwear?
Where were you when there was trouble?
If it weren't for them, we'd be finished.
Be reasonable!
I'll reason with you.
You owe me three months' rent.
That's $90.
Pay up or pack up!
Don't you worry.
I'll pay it.
Think you're a smartass, Rabbit-Tooth Jane?
What's it to you, tub of lard?
Bitch!
Calm down, Landlady.
This is your fault.
-Are you trying to kill us?
-You're right.
How could you do that?
Shut the hell up!
You think you can out-yell me?
The fat lady can really sing.
Watch this!
What happened?
What do you mean, what happened?
You try it.
-Me?
-Quick!
Sorry!
You okay?
I think you should get closer and take better aim.
Okay?
Okay!
-Who's throwing the handles?
-Handle?
Where's the third knife?
God knows where it went.
Could it be the same one?
Can't be....
-Don't!
-Sorry.
What are you trying to say?
I just remembered I have something to do.
See you!
Uh-oh.
They've seen us!
Stay back!
Don't panic!
Snakes like music.
If I whistle, they won't bite.
Please, no more bright ideas.
Oh, what the hell!
Not you again, asshole!
Get back to your business!
Split up!
Split?
What're you doing here?
Looking for you.
Weren't you hurt?
I'm fine!
How come you always recover so fast?
I don't know.
-Which hospital did you go to?
-Don't remember.
Maybe it's better that way.
Memories can be painful.
To forget may be a blessing!
I never knew you were so deep.
All the sadness one can bear down the river everywhere.
Hey, get out of the way!
Move!
I'll slap you to kingdom come!
Look at those four-eyes carting around a coffin.
What morons!
Don't blame me for making you leave.
We'll let Buddha decide whether you stay or go.
HORRlFlCALLY BAD FATE
Have some tea.
We're grateful for some professional help.
We understand the problem.
Twelve Kicks from the Tam School Iron Fist from the Hung School and the Hexagon Staff....
Those guys at Pig Sty are really good.
Their warrior days are long over but they're still top fighters.
This job is a great challenge for us.
Now, that's professionalism.
Number One Killers.
Expensive, yes, but worth every penny!
No!
Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer.
He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy.
I heard he's now in an asylum.
So you're the top killers now.
Strictly speaking, we're just musicians.
A song that wrenches the heart O where do i find a knowing ear?
Great poem, isn't it?
We'll be saying goodbye soon.
Who knows when we'll see each other again.
We're three of a kind.
Wish we'd known before.
Let's take this opportunity to spar a little.
No.
We still have a lot to pack.
You're right.
Twelve Kicks of the Tam School!
Superb attack and defense!
Iron Fist: powerful yet delicate.
Topnotch!
Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves.
Mystical!
Till we meet again!
More lipstick!
Stay there, or I'll break you in half.
Sorry, we're closed.
You can make a suit in no time.
We're moving.
This is good material!
You know your stuff.
This has high artistic value.
How high?
At least a few stories....
Insulting the Axe Gang!
We'll show them.
Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel.
Don't block my view!
What's going on?
Good!
Don't block my view!
Damn!
I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here.
-Really?
-Yeah.
What the hell is this fighting?
Who'll pay for the damage?
Sorry, sorry.
It's nothing!
You know what time it is?
I have to sleep.
Hey, fatso, eat shit and die!
Die?
In this racket?
Sorry, sorry!
Get out of my way!
Hang in there, Tailor.
Be quiet!
Give us a break!
Why push us so far?
There's another master?
It's the Lion's Roar!
I thought that was a myth.
Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists?
That's the last we'll see of them.
It's bad, Brother Sum.
Quick, start the car!
Start the car!
Boss!
Keep it down!
Have you no manners?
Get lost.
People are trying to sleep.
They have to work tomorrow.
Get out of here!
Scumbags!
I can't hang on much longer.
But having seen real masters like you I can now die in peace.
Don't say that.
We're ordinary folks.
Ordinary's a blessing.
Don't call us masters.
But you're such great fighters!
If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way.
Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons.
Years ago we saw our only son killed in a fight.
Revenge can be devastating.
Do you understand?
Why don't you train us to be top fighters and we'll avenge them!
Becoming a top fighter takes time.
Unless you're a natural-born kung-fu genius.
And they're one in a million.
It's obvious I'm the one!
Don't think so.
Everyone!
We swore we'd never fight again.
But we broke that promise today.
For your own safety, please all leave!
In great power lies great responsibility.
There's no escaping from it.
Donut, you're hurt bad.
Rest now.
We can't understand what you're saying.
Donut!
I know you, four-eyes!
You seem prejudiced against the sight-challenged.
That's right.
Especially gold-framed four-eyes.
Gold frames are perfect for clerks.
I think I look good.
So why keep picking on me?
Help me!
"Help me!
Help me!" Want to play, punks?
The Dragon Style?
The Tiger Style?
Come down here, and I'll smash your glasses.
Come on!
You know I'd do it, right?
Swear to it!
Swear!
Have you no respect?
Where were you when I needed you?
You sound like a wimp!
We always get beat!
We haven't gotten anywhere.
No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes all because of you!
You're a numb-nut!
Follow me!
It's a stickup!
Where's the money?
Where's the money?
What're you looking at?
I'm serious!
I kill people for less!
Give me the money.
The money's in here.
Let go of the girl!
He's a fool, and she's mute.
Losers!
Go away!
You're dragging me down!
Go home and raise pigs.
Go, before I kill you.
You!
Whatsyourname!
Take this and get some new clothes.
You're now an Axe!
-For real?
-Someone's waiting for you.
Brother Sum!
One look at you, and I knew you'd do anything.
Right!
You just needed your chance.
Damn right!
We've an assignment for you.
Anything, Brother Sum!
"Research on abnormal people." What's that?
A mental asylum.
Soldiers!
Boy Scouts!
Tanks!
No worries.
When the Boy Scouts change shifts, you have exactly five minutes.
Follow the arrows on the map.
Go to the last cell and get the man inside there out.
Here's your tools.
What about you guys?
We're your lookouts.
Five minutes.
Hurry!
The world's top killer indeed looks the part!
It's only a title.
Cut the bullshit.
We want two people killed.
Name your price.
Name my what?
I've killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary.
So far, I've never found one.
That's why I stayed inside.
Had I met my match, I'd have been out long ago.
If you find me a worthy opponent I'll do it for free.
No charge!
Do you have someone?
Yes.
Brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge.
But first, will you show us some moves?
Not that we don't trust you.
We want to see you in action.
You numskulls aren't worthy!
He doesn't look the part.
The slippers are a little crappy.
But he'll clean up well.
You sure you got the right guy?
Absolutely.
I swear I did exactly what you told me.
Please show us some moves, Mr. Beast.
Don't make it hard for me!
You dumb or what?
You know what this is, old man?
Ever seen a fist this big?
Don't force me to fight.
I scare myself when I fight!
Really?
Try me, then.
Is he okay?
So you say you can fight?
Harder!
Harder!
Harder!
You hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
A foreign gun!
In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner.
The Beast is the best of them all.
The Axe Gang extends its respect!
The real masters, together in one room!
Only the world's top killer has such an aura.
Likewise.
Could you two be the fated lovers...?
Paris and Helen of Troy!
A pleasure, indeed.
We're here to deal with the Axe Gang and only the Axe Gang.
You should've killed me before.
Now you're committing suicide.
You're living on borrowed time.
You can't escape your fate!
What's this?
A funeral bell?
With the Beast here, let's see whose funeral it is!
So you're on their side?
Don't get me wrong.
I only want to kill you or be killed by you.
What do you think?
The good cannot coexist with the bad.
You can't escape your destiny.
So be it.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Let's do it!
Piece of cake.
I can handle this.
Good try, but a little off target.
The Lion's Roar?
Wait!
I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker!
What a blow!
-Looks like they're not up to it!
-Let's get them while they're down.
You do it!
-I'm gonna puke!
I need to see a doctor!
-Go to hell!
You!
Come over here.
-Hit him!
-Yes!
-The head!
-Of course!
-Hit him on the head!
-Okay.
-Here's your chance.
-Got it!
-Hit him!
-Hit him!
-Hit the shit out of him!
-Right!
-Hit him!
-Hit him!
Beat the shit out of him!
What're you doing?
You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
You're making me very confused!
Wow, that's a big fist!
Why did you hit me?
Where are they?
How could you let them escape?
No one gets away from me!
Why did he save us?
Young people make mistakes.
But at least he finally made good.
Look at him!
Beaten to a pulp.
Do you have any last requests?
Hey, wait!
Why don't you write in Chinese?
I don't understand.
There's no one here!
chinese medicine
It's a miracle he lasted this long.
The herbs should help him.
Herbal medicine can only partly help.
The key is his own body structure.
All his bones and tendons are broken.
It's amazing he's recovering so fast.
It can't be possible....
Unless he's....
What's that smell?
You mustn't smoke while you're hurt.
Let me handle this.
This makes no sense.
Who knew the Beast could clear the chi flow and thus unleash the boy's true potential?
We should've guessed.
He is the one!
Is this for real?
You're still alive, you turncoat?
Kill him, men!
What kind of move is that?
Kids' stuff!
If our son were alive, he'd be his age now.
If he studies hard, he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer.
A stuntman, more likely!
Not bad.
Let's go.
I can even stop bullets--
What?
The Toad Style of the Kwan Lun School?
Oh, no!
Remember the Palm move that falls from heaven?
That's the long lost Buddhist Palm.
I surrender!
What kind of move was that?
If you want to learn, I'll teach you.
Master!
Hey!
Tell him not to put snot on the glass.
You two, put your pants on!
No licking if you're not buying!
Kid, you have the bone structure of a kung-fu genius.
World peace is in your hands.
Here's the scroll of the Buddhist Palm.
Because it's fate, I'll let you have it for $1 0.
Wait!
You want more...?
We check our watches now and then, to see what time it is...
But so what?
What is good this minute doesn't mean it'll last, and bad things don't last forever either...
Nothing in life is predictable, except we never treasure what we have this very moment... well, are they shooting the commercial at our school or not?
Forget it!
So what if they come?
Think they'll let us join in?
Let's go grab a VCD instead!
Those are the bastards!
Come on!
Let's go!
Hold it right there!
Stop running!
Who says mobs are not allowed to fight before lunch?
Why?
Why huh?
Just look at your sorry state!
You're all like dead fish!
You shouldn't have summoned us so early, Razor.
What on earth you are saying?
!
Never heard of a schoolboy wanting to attend classes...
Right?
What are schools for if there are no students?
Cut the crap!
I've heard that they're making a commercial in our school today!
Don't tell me that you don't fancy Charlene?
But Gillian is the one I like!
You're so full of shit!
Don't say that!
Don't even think that I'm nagging you.
I only want to coach you because you show promises and talent.
I don't always waste my time.
What talent do I have?
Painting!
You have a great art sense!
Really?
Really!
Here, just raise your skirt a little bit... so I can see those thighs... what have they got to do with painting?
Of course there are no relations!
But there must be balance...!
I just need to see if you can make a good athlete as well.
Go on, higher, I'm not going to take advantage of you.
Higher...
You piece of shit!
I have never seen such enthusiasm for the Big Boss's war council meeting!
Who do you take me for?
Huh?
A bloody fool?
!
It's not what you think, boss!
Dee, Blade, wing and Song are all hosting birthday parties for their Mom.
On the same day?
!
Well, you see, they're blood brothers!
They're more than just brothers-in-arms!
I really am going to teach them a lesson this time!
No, wait, Razor...
Save your breath!
Who says we cannot beat someone up in broad daylight?
You have 30 minutes to get ready.
Just wake up!
Truth is we don't get enough sleep, Razor.
He's right...
and we're not even true gangsters...
I just brew coffee!
I cook instant noodles...
I'm just a waiter...
and my shift does not start until five.
I'll talk to your class tutor.
I'll sort out everything for you!
Are you serious?
Hey!
Come on out!
It's not everyday you have a new intern teacher!
I almost got him and you screwed it all up for me!
You're thinking of blackmailing your teacher?
He deserves it for being a pervert!
Just look at him!
You attend school just for this?
It's better than your not attending at all!
Cut it out, she's your kid sister!
You're not going to beat her up, are you?
If those two scums can make it through lunch today,
I'll catch prostatitis!
But it's not nice to pick on schoolboys, is it?
You can pick on the principal too if you wish!
This is wonderful!
We think we're hitting big time at last!
Now look what you've got me into?
Where are your foot soldiers?
Where's your brothers-in-arms?
The Big Boss calls a war council and all he gets is these three goons?
!
We're a laughing stock now!
If I'd known sooner, then all we need are two bicycles!
And this is costing me a fortune!
Since we've already splashed out on this, why don't we... why don't we what?
Recruit some extras to make up the number!
Extras?
Go to hell!
Watch it, driver!
Wanna go to hell?
!
What's with all these fighting talks?
Boss Ganker!
Good morning!
Wow, cool bus!
Going sightseeing?
What's with all these hardware?
You want to cause trouble in my home territory?
Not at all!
I just need to fix the plumbing in my store!
Hey Boss!
Let's get to work!
Hey kid, where you heading?
Want to make a quick buck?
Boss Ganker, something cooking?
Just shut up and bring us some tea.
Broken pipes!
Drink time!
The usual:
Ice cold and easy on the sugar!
Boss...
I want them to have great look!
Not starving nerds like this.
Don't you get it?
How about these two?
I fear you may really end up catching prostatitis!
Brother Kai!
Brother Kai!
Get out and make room!
Yes Boss!
Brother Kai... what's all these about?
The Big Boss convenes a war council!
Brother King!
Brother King!
Get out!
Stop crowding the lift!
How are your boys lately?
You've got to teach them good manners!
Brother James!
Brother James!
Make room for Brother James, get out!
Move it!
You're early for a change.
The meeting starts soon.
Brother Song!
Brother Song!
I think I've left something on the bus.
Let's go and fetch it.
Yes!
Take the stairs!
I thought we're going to fetch something.
Smarten up, won't you?
We've not been paid yet!
Never knew Boss Ganker is such a small fly.
Got me too.
He used to boss us around in the neighborhood.
What a feast!
Are you sure this is a war council?
Is someone getting married?
Big Boss's meeting is serious business!
Bowl, this is so cool!
All we got to do is just hang around, and get paid two hundred dollars!
We've to thank Razor for this!
And we've got to meet the real Godfather, too.
We're in luck!
Is he the one they call "Platinum" Han?
How would I know?
Kill, kill, kill that scum!
Chop off his hand!
Cut off his toes!
Douse him with soft drink!
When the going gets tough, the tough gets going!
All for one!
Boss Han...
I'm happy to see that we unite together as one!
Today we've been shamed!
But we'll get even!
Is that right?
!
Yeah!
I have always been a tolerant person.
But it doesn't mean I have to take it lying down.
Is that right?
!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Good!
So, in that case... who will carry out this honorable duty?
Brother Song has the strongest men.
Send someone from his clan!
Little B has always wanted to prove himself.
I don't think we should stand in his way!
Taipan is well known for his ferocity.
He should go, and I rest my case!
Whoever dares to take this job from Old Craze is picking a fight with me!
No, I think Ganker's perfect for the job.
He has the coolest head amongst us!
Right?
Ganker!
Ganker!
Even though I'd love to give it a try,
I just wouldn't want Ginger to miss this chance of a lifetime!
Ganker!
Ginger!
Ginger!
Go to hell!
You're all pieces of shit!
Boss Han!
What is it?
Be affable and courteous!
I'm cool, but I'm worried about my wife and kids.
How can I avoid this disaster, Master Law?
Simple rules...
Just stay affable and courteous!
Affable and what?
As long as you stay calm and well mannered for two weeks, your whole family will be safe!
That's a piece of cake;
I'm always well mannered!
You bunch of useless scums!
If it's not for my courtesy campaign,
I wouldn't give a damn about any of you!
Where were you when the going gets tough?
Count yourself lucky!
None of you will survive if I am my old me!
There are rules and regulations.
But I'll never force you to do something that you don't want to.
We have our Guardian Saint with us today.
He'll witness our righteousness!
We are a family, so for fairness's sake, we will draw lots for this job!
Whoever draws the lot with GLORY will have the honour!
To be fair, we all have to draw lots.
I'll go first!
I'll draw for Boss Han.
This one is mine.
Don't be a fool!
Do we really go for the draw?
You're the one who complained about that woman across the street!
Tammy was accused by her of theft, and ended up with the police.
We agreed to take revenge for Tammy.
We'll mess up her place and beat her up!
So are you in or not?
Remember what you promised me last year?
What's bothering you?
What's the time now?
Candy, can you just get off the phone?
Can't you see he's just fooling around with you?
Yeah, I know.
We need someone to do the job, right?
I heard you.
But no one will volunteer to do this.
What if that bitch got us?
Look, there's a guy over there!
That is one ugly guy!
Dare to kiss him?
Are you serious?
!
Who chicken out will have to do the job!
Are you all right?
Need some help?
Go to hell!
Ha!
Ha!
Fool!
Hey!
Hey!
Noodle!
The family's in trouble!
What are you kids up to again?
Damn it, such poor luck!
There goes my chance to show my worth.
Hey, you, come here!
Come here!
What's up Boss?
Your men?
Yeah...
Hey, you, come here!
Move your asses over here and greet Boss Han!
Getting bored, huh?
No, not really.
He said he wanted to volunteer, but he's worried that he'd miss the draw.
Making fun of me?
No Boss, he wouldn't dare!
We shouldn't be taking too much of your time.
You want to volunteer for the job?
Are you afraid that others might take your place?
You still have a chance,
Go on, go and draw your lot!
Let it not be, surely it can't be!
What's your name, kid?
My friends call me Noodle...
How about I give you a hand?
It's alright, Boss...
No?
All right then...
Oh!
You knew this is the wrong lot?
Seems like you really want the job.
Go on!
Jackpot!
No, we were actually...
Bowl!
Shut up!
There's no way back now!
I'll see what I can do!
You call yourself my buddy!
?
What's all these?
Drew your lots already?
Boss Han is a meticulous person!
There's another lot that says "MISSION".
Should something happen to our first choice, we still have a backup!
Since you two are buddies, it's your turn!
Need a hand?
This one!
Jackpot!
Yeah!
These two kids are set for glory!
Boss Han, they're from my clan!
My name's Ganker.
My men call me Old Ganker.
Old Ganker, that's me!
Glorious Mission!
Glorious Mission!
We don't even belong to the family!
We were just paid extras!
He paid us a few hundred bucks just to hang around!
Glorious Mission!
Glorious Mission!
The Mission is simple!
There's this guy called Serpent.
He's been a real pain-in-the-butt, and messed up several of our men!
You go chop off his hand!
He is protected by bodyguards round the clock.
It's hard to get near him.
However...
He'll leave his massage parlor every morning at six ...and walk down an alley on his own.
His bodyguards will meet him up around the corner.
The walk through the alley takes only 30 seconds...
You'll ambush him by six in the morning!
Here's $300,000 to take care of your folks.
Noodle, Bowl!
I'm Noodle!
I'm Bowl!
No difference!
Listen kids, it's a man's duty to take care of his family.
The money is for your families.
Just in case things go wrong and life can get tough for them.
Don't blow them away, you hear me?
Got it...
But Boss, we are actually...
Listen to me!
Those who can't cook are not real women, and those had not been to jail aren't true men!
If you get caught,
Just think of prison as a boarding school.
Wow, there's so much money!
What are you doing?
Tell me what you are doing!
Put it down!
Down!
Can't you see we're having a meeting?
You think it's funny?
How dare for you to barge in like this?
You know what money is this?
Didn't they teach you manners?
I'm asking you a question!
Boss Han, I'm just...
Stop calling my name!
You haven't answered my question!
Where's your manners?
Boss Han.
And what's your problem?
Affable and courteous!
Affable and courteous!
Am I not affable?
I didn't even prick her eyeballs!
Consider yourself lucky that I've got to behave properly.
That's why I didn't try any harder.
You don't get so lucky everyday.
Am I not nice and affable?
Am I not kind?
Yes, of course you are!
See, she admitted herself!
You're right, Boss!
Boss, it's the song you've chosen.
You're affable and courteous too...
Sure.
Let's listen.
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!
This is what Boss sings!
Let's listen.
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!
Congratulation!
Great... better than Hacken Lee.
Great... better than Hacken Lee.
What?
Better than Hacken Lee?
Do you know our releationship?
Who is Hacken Lee?
I don't know.
Do you know?
No, I don't.
Let me tell you.
He's my idol.
How do you know I'm learning from him?
Congratulations!
Right...
Encore, boss!
Cool.
I've finally found those who like my voice.
Take the belongings.
Let's play overnight.
Go... why don't you settle the bill!
?
Check sir?
After discount, the bill comes to $28,800.
There goes $28,800!
We can drink ourselves silly elsewhere with that!
Hi!
It's Bowl!
Wanna come out?
What?
We have loads of cash!
Our treat!
If you have loads of cash, then I am a billionaire!
I'm serious!
Save it!
Hello!
Hello?
Hello, Pizza?
It's me, Bowl.
Wanna have some fun?
How come there is only $269,200 left?
Nobody wants to come out.
They all think I'm kidding.
Fools!
Where's Ling?
Ling has visiting relatives.
How about Forty?
Forty?
Don't know where he is.
No answer.
Now we are loaded but no friends, what should we do with the money?
The Boss said this is for our folks!
For our families?
What about your grandmother?
Forget her.
Every time she sees me, she either screams or nags at me.
I don't owe her anything.
But my father does.
I thought your father's dead.
He is to me, anyway.
He ran off with his mistress!
At least I don't have to stand his pathetic sight.
But my mom was stupid enough to kill herself for him.
I can never tell what's in a woman's mind.
Let's talk about something else.
Give it to your kid sister then.
I'd rather spend it myself.
How about your mother?
My mom?
She's doing great and doesn't need the money.
Then how come she works night shift all the time?
Look, we haven't even started spending.
Let's go and have some fun!
Fun?
What kind of fun?
Whatever our money can buy!
Let's not worry about it... we can start with a real decent meal!
Right on!
Yeah!
Are you done with your phone yet?
Obviously your guy is dating another girl.
You'll keep your promise, won't you?
The loser has to steal some clothes!
Are you going to keep your promise?
You sworn the other day!
You said you'd wish time could stand still!
You are making me lose face!
I just can't leave my friend on his own.
Don't be unreasonable.
Where are you now?
I'm keeping Andy company in Cheung Chau.
In Cheung Chau?
Yap!
How come there's traffic?
Oh, I can hardly hear you now.
Can't hear me?
I'll come to look for you!
I got to go now.
Andy's not right!
Bye.
So are you going or not?
It's no big deal!
Hey!
Thief!
Stupid bitch!
Oops!
Take that!
How old are you, kid?
Don't drink if you can't hold your liquor!
It is such a waste!
Serves you right!
Just mind your own business!
You're so rude, Cabbie!
Driving a cab is a skilled profession, too!
We are good atjudging people.
What are two kids doing in the middle of the night?
Odd jobs?
Keep the change!
Wow!
Told you we are good judges of people!
I can tell that you are rich!
Where's your Mercedes?
Want me to drop you off?
Want me to wait here for you?
Just leave!
Leave!
Oops!
Is he dead?
Noodle!
Wake up!
Hey, wake up!
Please don't die on me!
You promised we'd run a penny arcade together!
You say we'd get married on the same day, remember?
You said you wanted to hold Gillian's hand,
No need to get over-excited!
What's up?
I thought he's dead!
You're not that drunk, are you?
Wake up.
We've still got a lot of cash to burn.
We still got more than two hundred thousand!
You're such a loser!
From high noon to death wish, the past 12 hours was like a nightmare.
If the hangover would just go on for another 6 hours...
I don't even want to think about it.
I don't want to wake up...
Quit daydreaming!
You're not that cool!
They wouldn't have to resort to drawing lots if it was an easy job, and the Boss wouldn't be paying us three hundred grand!
So what can we do?
You never had any bright idea!
I always count on you.
How about returning the cash?
Are you sure that you're not mental?
Didn't you see how awful the Boss can be?
One wrong word and we'll be dead!
What can we do?
My head is still in a spin!
Okay, since there are two of us, we can set an ambush!
We'll find ourselves a steel chain, and tie it to a cart, when he appears, you'll... wait!
What now?
Your pose is so cool!
Really?
Let me see...
Awesome!
Just like Kill Bill!
Your turn to shoot me!
One more shot!
Why must I squat like this?
You'll get a better angle that way!
Just shoot it!
Why do I always have to do the donkey's work?
I want to look cool too!
You dare to do the hit yourself?
He would have been tripped over!
But the cell phone is mine!
In that case I've nothing else to say!
Delete them and just forget it!
Hey, wait!
I don't even know what Serpent looks like.
No... where are you going?
Go ask Ganker!
Need a cab?
Get on!
Hello, Brother Ganker?
It's me, Bowl!
There's something that I want to ask you.
We want to know what Serpent looks like!
Go ask Rotten Keung, he knows better!
Rotten Keung?
He has taken a picture once with Serpent!
We're here...
It seems that we are being surrounded by brothels!
Move on and stop talking!
Have you ever been to one?
One what?
Brothel!
With my look, I don't need to.
What about you?
I'm saving my first night for Gillian!
Hey kids, what are you doing here so late?
This guy's so rude!
We are here for women, is that okay with you?
I'm from the vice squad!
Leave these two punks to me!
Check them out!
ID... wow!
Aren't you a bit young for the brothels?
It's not what you think, sir.
We're justjoking with that stupid looking guy!
Making fun of an officer?
What are you doing out so late?
Looking for someone!
Who are you looking for?
Rotten Keung...
Are you related?
Don't know him at all!
Don't know him?
By the wall!
What have we done now, officer?
A body search!
We are good citizens!
Sure you are... what's in this package?
Stop making fun of us, officer.
I'm not kidding, I'm on duty now!
That's not what I meant.
We really appreciate what you guys do.
My childhood ambition is... to become a good and righteous policeman!
Is that so?
Sure!
Especially a uniformed police officer.
You look fantastic in your uniform!
To protect and serve, forjustice and honor...
That's right!
I have never seen an officer look as good as you!
Just look at you, fit as a fiddle!
Right?
You look more handsome than...
Andy Lau!
Now that you mentioned it... sharper than Andy Lau!
Look at those cuffs...
Have you quite finished?
Stop changing the subject, but you did make some valid points.
David, get to work!
Yes, sir!
Don't let me run into you around here again!
Phew!
We'll be in big trouble if we end up in the station!
Move on!
Out of the way!
Do you know where Rotten Keung is?
Let's go and look for him!
You are Rotten Keung?
He's at the back!
Rotten Keung?
At the end of the queue!
Rotten Keung?
At the back!
Are you Rotten Keung?
Rotten Keung?
You Rotten Keung?
!
Who wants to know?
Brother Ganker sent us;
He said you've taken a photo with Serpent!
Stop fooling around, I thought you guys are cops!
Please help us!
That photo is vital to us!
You are having me on, kid!
Come on, Rotten Keung!
My Mom doesn't know I run a brothel!
I'll be in deep trouble if the press takes my picture!
Please help!
Oh alright!
I give up!
Go to the underground casino in wanchai, the picture's right there in the office.
Go find it for yourself!
Thanks a lot!
Kids, get out of the way!
Stop being a nuisance.
Even if we found the photo, we still may not know what Serpent looks like.
But Bowl is so serious about it.
I know he wants to do something.
It beats just standing there in fear.
Knowing that one is about to die.
It is amazing how quickly your mind can work.
What are you thinking about?
Nothing...
just wondering what the casino is all about.
Just an underground casino.
Right.
Okay.
Come on.
God of Gamblers may come today.
And Saint of Gamblers too.
Really?
Hold on.
Ladies and Gentlemen. 5 As!
Please don't do it.
I've never been beaten up.
You don't dare?
Try to see if you'd be kicked out.
I'm just thinking.
You have been thinking of it for years.
Sorry.
This is my hope.
My will!
So underground casinos do exist in Hong Kong!
Hey, Noodle!
No!
You know what I had in mind?
I know you want to play God of Gamblers!
Right?
Since we don't have a better way to spent our money...
Please say yes!
Can I just be cool for once?
But we need to save the money for our families!
Cut the crap and save your breath!
Look...
Are we brothers?
We're looking for a photo.
Hey, Bowl!
That's for real?
You think this is counterfeit money?
They are all real, my friend!
You wanna go double or nothing?
$50,000!
Want to split?
Split the two aces!
Four aces!
Split?
Split them!
Bowl!
Relax!
There are 128 royals and tens in eight packs of cards.
I can't lose!
Split!
Royal!
No!
3,4,5 and 6?
What's wrong with these cards?
Forget it, Bowl!"
All right, double or nothing!
Want to carry on?
Another ten grand, split them!
Four aces again?
Still want to split?
But you are running out of cash!
Says who?
You wait while I make a call!
Let me make a call.
Boss?
I'm going...
Since we're such bosom friends, let's not talk about money,
Here's $300 for the road...
For the road?
Take it, I'm most affable these days;
No need to show any gratitude!
Take a cab and go straight home.
Something terrible may happen in wanchai later...
Yes, Boss Han!
Son of a bitch!
May!
May...
Hello?
Bowl?
Which Bowl?
I need to borrow three hundred grand!
I'm serious Boss!
If you don't lend us the money and we run out of cash, you'll only force us into hiding...
You can run but you can't hide!
Do you know what will happen if you now quit?
All right, forget it.
You're in luck this time!
I've got to be affable!
You can have the loan.
But business is business,
I'll be charging interest!
Sure!
No problem!
Hey, Boss Han is on the line!
Right...
Yes, boss!
So?
It's okay!
Now there's cash to split the aces!
So?
Split them of course!
You got to be kidding?
16 aces?
Split them all!
Split!
No way!
Eight packs of cards, 32 aces, and I got them all!
Nobody's going believe this!
Want to continue splitting?
Split!
All right!
Hit them!
Show all!
Royal!
Royal!
Royal!
Am I not the God of Gamblers?
Yeah!
What?
!
You lost four hundred grand in one hand?
Here you go, kids;
Do yourself a favour and leave!
You're lucky that Boss Han owns this joint;
Or else you won't live to see daylight!
But we played a fair game with no tricks!
Just learn to quit while you're ahead!
Here's the photo that you want.
That's Serpent in the middle!
Which one is he, then?
The one in the middle!
But which one?
Whatever!
Does it really matter?
Does it?
Now what should we do with all these extra cash?
What should we do?
We are now filthy rich!
Everybody...
Let's go!
Yeah!
Noodle, let's play a game!
Could we buy a school with $800,000?
The good thing about fantasy is that it is free!
But I could, I'll take out a contract on that stupid form tutor!
Let's repay the loan to Boss Han first!
You must be out of your mind?
Anyway, we're going to die or end up in jail.
Why should we worry about repaying the loan?
That's a fair point!
You're pretty smart this time...
This place is so off the beaten track!
But I'm guided by my sixth sense!
Hey!
That's Gillian!
Really?
There...
See the little one?
Right...
Let's take a closer look...
Hold on!
Making movies is no big deal!
But we've got to find the right approach.
Is that necessary?
Just stop complaining!
You had fun as a gambling god, now's my turn!
What do you have in mind?
You want to be the lead actor?
Of course not!
But, come to think of it... it'll be really cool to act along side Gillian.
Don't you agree?
I don't think they can refuse $500,000 from us to shoot a scene...
Here's $400,000.
We'll pay the balance when we get the copy...
Boss, boss...
I know...
Those are the kids who want to appear in our film?
Add a scene?
I'm an artist for crying out loud!
Either you do it or I'll do it myself!
But we've got to bring in the scriptwriter...
Are you kidding?
I'm not a whore you know... and I wasn't even paid...
So do you want to be paid or not?
It would be nice.
So, what do you have in mind?
How about Judge Bao?
He's tanned.
I think he's cool!
What about me?
You'll play the judge's bodyguard.
He's cool too!
Zhao, the Royal Cat?
Great!
The Royal Cat!
Don't you think... it's a bit weird?
But it's a fantasy!
But fantasy doesn't sound right for this film.
Hey, I'm talking to you!
If it's a fantasy sequence, then it doesn't have to make sense.
We like to discuss it with our agent first.
I forgot how to write the character "less".
Which "less"?
Less as in "lesser".
Oh, I see...
How do you do?
I'm Noodle!
Hi How are you?
We need to go and put on more makeup.
Bye
I held her hand!
Ready!
Action!
Help!
Help!
Help us!
What should we do?
If only Judge Bao and his bodyguard are here!
There's Judge Bao!
You're right!
Zhao, did you hear someone screaming for help?
Yes, I did!
Judge Bao!
Save us, Judge Bao!
How do you know that I am Judge Bao?
But who else could have such a nice tan!
Well said!
My dear ladies...
Director, "ladies" here doesn't sound right...
It's all right, we'll dub it later!
You're unbelievable!
It was you who said not to take it seriously.
I don't think this is right, Director.
Zhao uses a saber, not a sword.
Special effects will take care of it.
Carry on, action!
Dear ladies...
You need not be afraid!
Tell me what happened?
We're being chased by a villain!
Really?
Who dares to be so unlawful?
Director, the word "unlawful" doesn't sound right either.
I know, I know.
Just carry on.
Really, Director, I prefer using a saber.
Right!
Should we do another take?
Director, just hold everything for the moment!
So...?
Remember we've paid for this!
I rather use a saber.
Just give it to him.
This is getting out of hand.
We'll get our agent to look at this.
Surely this can't be released!
I never want to do this in the first place, whose brilliant idea was it?
I haven't slept for over thirty hours...
Treat this as a break, things will be fine when you awake.
Judge Bao, you're such a great cool guy!
Too bad that I'm already married;
You should not have fallen for me!
Cut!
That's a great take!
Isn't it over the board?
Certainly not!
It's fantasy!
All right Twins, that's a wrap!
But there are shots missing!
What do you mean?
We're done.
The kissing shots.
Oh yes!
Camera over here!
Wait, Gillian you still have to do an insert.
I don't mind if you're a married man.
All I want is a good memory!
What memory?
To prove that you love me!
What kind of proof?
Kiss kiss!
Kiss kiss?
Yes!
Kiss kiss!
Just how much passion is there in this world?
If you insist, I'm only too happy to oblige!
Not me...
Give him a smooch!
Him?
I'll be very touched by your courage!
Director, the dialogue has changed!
It's wonderful!
The changes are great.
Such passion!
Go on!
Come on!
Hurry!
Bowl!
Stop dreaming!
She's just fooling with you!
Just let me kiss you once!
Wake up!
Gillian always lies to you!
Just give me one kiss!
Snap out of it!
For my future's sake, for my first kiss with Gillian... just let me kiss you once!
Back off!
This is not funny!
Snap out of it!
Stop it!
Must you kiss that hard?
Don't be a spoilt sport.
We're friends after all!
We spent a fortune for nothing!
At least we have a good memory!
Memory?
Some memory indeed!
I'll remember this for life!
You scum!
We need somewhere to stash up the cash.
Wow!
What a waste!
Sorry Sir, I'm about to quit...
You shouldn't feel sorry for yourself?
It's him again!
Not so fast!
Go freshen up and we'll talk!
Come on.
Over here!
Come on!
Sir...
Please let me go, sir!
Are you done yet?
Saline's good for you!
Give me a break, sir!
You must be the most useless person in town!
Subsidizing your addiction with social security.
Wasting taxpayers' money!
While honest citizens like us toil to make ends meet.
I go on foot patrol... till my feet are swollen... and all you do is to break the law.
Officer...
You again?
Hands over your head!
I didn't see or hear anything, sir!
On your head!
Come on out!
Freeze!
Where did you get all those money?
We won them on the gambling table!
I've never heard that you could win at gambling!
It not what you think, sir!
You're on your own?
Where's your pal?
Back home sleeping!
Guess you need some freshening up, too...
I'm fine!
Move on!
Move on!
Stupid cop!
Ass holes!
Grab his handcuff!
You made us do this!
Let me go!
Or you'll be in big trouble!
Oh yeah?
You don't know what's in store for you!
I can't breathe!
Take that bag off my head.
We can talk!
What can you do except bullying kids and junkies?
What else do you know?
Is it right for him to take drugs?
Is it right for you to wander around late at night, with a few hundred thousand dollars in cash?
Let me go!
Or you'll be in big trouble once we're back at the station!
Who are you trying to kid?
Anyway we are incorrigible!
What are you up to now?
Am I cool or not?
Not bad at all.
Let me try.
Give it back to me!
Looks pretty good!
Knock it off, man!
Cops don't have long hair!
Says who?
You're out of your mind!
What do you want?
This is not going to be good!
You're wearing the belt on the wrong side.
The pants are too short for you!
Short?
Don't think so!
That's fashion!
You get the cool uniform!
But what about me?
Can't help it, the uniform suits me better!
Go to hell!
I don't give a damn!
I'll take the gun.
I can be a CID!
Look, cool!
Let's go on the beat!
Great!
I don't think that's a very good idea!
Hey, old lady, we'll give you a hand!
It's all right, we got it!
I'll look out for you!
Let's do some graffiti.
How do you spell "tortoise"?
Just draw a turtle!
Lucy's mine tonight!
I'm not nick-named wanchai Romeo for nothing!
That's just sour grapes.
Sure I haven't touch any girl before.
But it doesn't mean that I'm no good!
Anyway, tonight's the night!
I'll be called King of the Studs from tomorrow.
Got to go now.
Bye...
Damn cat!
Trying to scare me?
Let me give you a shower!
Go get lost!
Hey, punk, are you drunk?
No, sir...
It's you two clowns again!
You're pretty tough, calling us names!
You must be out of your mind.
You're asking for it.
I can't entertain you tonight!
Cops on duty!
Kiss the wall and spread those legs!
I have no problem hugging the wall.
But I can't spread my legs.
Are you trying to bargain with us?
You want me to believe that's a real gun?
You want me to try it on you?
I'm inconvenient.
Let's talk tomorrow...
Hit the wall, you will be body searched!
You have the right to remain silent, but whatever you said may be used against you in a court of law!
What do you want, officers?
I've got urgent business tonight!
If you were not looking to beat us up, we wouldn't be in this fine mess now.
So much trouble is awaiting us.
I've already been told off by my Dad, for sending our chefs and waiters after you today.
All because of that dollar yesterday?
It's a matter of principle, like you said.
Just leave it to me!
You can't even count!
Hold it there!
Stop running!
You will fight me over a dollar?
Isn't that what you are trying to do?
It's all a matter of principle!
Go to hell!
Ahh!
My ear!
Here's your dollar, we're even!
Stop treating us like beggars!
We're rich!
What exactly do you want, sir?
What do we want?
What do we want?
On your knees and beg for forgiveness!
Playing games?
But I'm not free tonight!
Stop pushing me around!
Hey, You'd better not move!
Or I'll shoot!
Hey, he's shot!
Relax!
Chill!
I'm not shot.
I've just been caught by my zipper!
You're bleeding!
I told you but you wouldn't believe me!
Sure you can handle it?
You're bleeding like mad!
Get an ambulance!
Sure!
But there's blood everywhere!
It's OK!
Just try not to look.
You'll feel better by not looking.
But the truth is... if you don't stop the bleeding, you're going to die!
That serious?
I can't bare to look.
Please do me a favour.
Check it out for me!
So?
The zipper has caught the flesh.
There's a nasty hole and blood is pouring out...
It's disgusting!
Guess we have to free the zip first!
Stop!
Stop!
It hurts like hell!
I didn't even touch you!
Wait, give me something to bite on!
Here!
Bite the baton!
Relax!
I haven't even started!
You haven't?
Not yet!
Are you sure?
I got it!
Lucy...
I usually feel lost at the night.
I can't sleep, always looking for places to hang out.
This and that...
The hardest thing is to fall asleep.
But it's funny how time flew by tonight.
You are always after me... and treat me like a dog.
Want to freshen up?
This is awful!
What have I done wrong?
It must be payback time?
I've been a cop so long and I know all the tricks.
I've got a car and a home.
But they're all mortgaged to the bank... and I still owe them millions!
Life is hell!
This must be bad karma.
Sorry, I fired a shot!
That is bad news!
But no one's hurt!
Now that's a relief!
Brother:
I feel like dying, farewell.
Sis.
My cell phone is out of battery, I need change to make a call!
We don't take thousand-dollar bills!
But I've just bought over $900 worth of goods;
Can't you just give me one dollar in change?
Told you I don't take thousand-dollar bills!
My sister's life is in danger!
I don't know where she is!
I need to call her, don't you understand?
I don't take thousand dollar bills, do you understand?
Okay, you give me a dollar coin!
And I'll give you $1,000 in exchange!
And you want me to believe this is real money?
A dollar for a thousand, you think I'm an idiot?
Noodle, stop messing around!
Get a cab, I think I know where she is...
This is crazy!
We can't even make a phone call with all these money!
What a coincidence!
It's him again.
You really know where my sister is?
Just a wild guess!
No harm trying.
Step on it please, cabbie!
Life is at stake!
Didn't you hear the news?
Something's happening in wanchai soon!
Not sure what that could be, though.
It'd be another showdown between rival gangs.
It's no big deal as it happens all the time.
Mind the road!
Young man, control your temper!
Or you'll get acnes!
My sister is threatening to kill herself!
Please go faster!
What's the matter with you?
Your mom was a nut case.
You're next?
I want to die!
Give it back to me!
Are you out of your mind?
It's none of your business!
His promises were all lies!
Am I still your brother?
Go away!
I'm asking you, am I still your brother?
Get lost!
Are you on drugs?
Get lost!
I'm asking you, are you on drugs?
Go away!
Get lost!
I'm asking you a question, are you on drugs?
Go away!
He was so romantic to me, kept everything I gave him.
Our first movie tickets, the Game-boy I gave him for birthday,
the menu that we drew on when we shared our first dinner,
And even the paper tissue I gave him... when he hurt himself during a football game.
We had a memorable night.
But they were all lies!
Did you sleep with him that night?
I almost did.
What's that got to do with you?
He's obviously trying to trick you!
You read about these scoundrels all the time!
Do you really believe him?
And you even want to die for him?
Give it back to me!
The hell with you!
Wake up!
When a guy is going after a girl, he'll promise anything!
You would!
But not Billy!
Just snap out of this!
When are you going to wake up?
I'll hose you till you snap out of it!
Wake up!
Open your eyes!
Are you awake yet?
I'm asking you a question!
I'm asking you a question!
It's all over for me and your elder brother.
We want you to do well at school.
We don't want you to mess around with those punks!
I don't want you to become a loser like us!
Can't you see what's right and wrong?
If you want so much to die?
Go ahead!
I've talked to my sister, she wants to go visit grandmother!
I feel like going home to check on my mom, too.
We'll meet here an hour from now.
The Elderly Centre
Your grandmother?
She passed away two months ago!
So you'd only just thought of her?
These are her belongings.
We would have dumped them in another month!
That must be a present for you from granny!
Been hanging around the arcades again?
I can't never figure you out.
Don't you find it boring at those game arcades?
Have you eaten?
Want some fried noodle?
Here, you have always wanted to go to France...
This money...
Don't ask, they are properly earned!
Where are you going?
It's alright... where did you get the money?
I said it's all right.
I don't want your money.
Take it back!
You're scaring me!
Why do I have to work so hard?
I want you to have a good life!
I can't keep you in the dark.
You knew very well the kind ofjob that I do.
But why am I doing it?
What for?
What for?
You think I can get rich doing that?
You think I really want to go to France?
Son, you listen!
I have never been to school, but I can still bring you up properly!
I just don't want you to...
I'm pleading you!
Son...
Shit!
Your granny gave you this?
This is so out-dated!
Is it all right for us to leave just like this?
Or should we sacrifice ourselves knowing it's certain death?
That is foolish!
The Big Boss will kill us!
That's why we have to run!
Maybe someone will bump Han off soon.
Or maybe the cops will get him first!
I've got a terrible premonition!
Relax!
We've got enough cash to hide for a month.
China's cheap too!
Not this, I'm talking about you!
There's something wrong with you!
How did you get on with your mom?
Everything's fine.
I don't want to talk about it!
I need to go to pee...
I have never taken any responsibility before in my life.
Just let me be once.
Forgive me, Bowl.
What you doing?
Why didn't you pass out?
Have you gone mad?
You're crazy!
If we go like this, we'll both die.
You must have gone totally bonkers!
What are you doing?
I've never made a decision before.
I've never seen you behaving so silly.
We could easily end up in jail!
Han doesn't give us three hundred grand for nothing.
There must be a reason why!
You miss your mom.
And you're in love with my sister!
You think I'll feel good if you get yourself killed?
If he finds us, we'll both be dead!
You stupid pea-brain!
Gently!
Bastard, you've cut me!
I didn't mean to, they usually go down after one blow in movies!
You stupid fool!
Hey!
Stop it!
Sorry!
I've always thought that you're brave and gutsy!
It was all a smokescreen... we're going down anyway, might as well say what we want now or never!
You leave my watch alone!
I've asked my sister to meet you there.
Express your true feeling!
If you miss the boat now, you'll regret it for life!
Stop dallying, get over there!
Go on!
Hi!
You're here...
Yeah...
My brother said you have something to say to me...
Really?
But he said you have something to say to me!
So he lied to me?
!
And he lied to me too!
So... that is it, then.
Good bye!
You really have nothing to say to me?
Actually there is!
But...
But... when your brother said you tried to kill yourself,
I knew you'd be here.
Really?
How would you know?
I saw you passed by every day, when we were attending different schools.
You were spying on me?
Not really.
I used to live just around the corner!
I've got something to show you!
The tree is going to fall, stop shaking it!
Wait for me!
What are you doing up there?
It's all right!
I won't be long!
Don't climb any higher!
Come on down!
It's all right!
Just wait a little while longer!
Forget it, I don't feel for you at all!
Don't waste any more effort!
You're my brother's buddy, that's why I play with you.
My brother said you fancy me, and he told me to play along with you.
Truth is my brother wants me to keep you here!
I have no feeling for you at all!
I've always thought you're brave and gutsy!
It was all a smokescreen!
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
How would I know that you really like me?
I don't!
It's all your brother's plan!
I know you're still thinking about your boyfriend now.
But things are forever changing.
What are you talking about?
Sometimes, even a fleeting moment of happiness can last forever!
Noodle!
Noodle!
Noodle!
Noodle!
Over here!
Trying to play games with me again?
Candy just can't do anything right!
Why do you keep fooling around with me?
What if you got killed?
You think I'll be happy if you die alone?
No, it's only...
You piece of shit!
But we're dead anyway!
Han said he had left a knife here.
But I can't find it anywhere!
The knife is over here!
How would I know he'd wrap it in newspaper!
Superhero, can you handle this alone?
Hey, this isn't a bushido blade!
Shut up!
The clock will strike six soon!
You readjusted my watch, you idiot!
You all right?
Bring the steel chain over here now!
All right, all right!
Where's the cart?
What should we do?
Put it here!
When you go for it, hit him as hard as you whacked me.
I'd appreciate it!
Relax, I'll be cruel!
I've tried to share with her my dream,
Supper with her, I guess you can call that love
My heart turns to jelly when I whisper her name
But I feel it's wrong for me to even touch her hands
Call me a dreamer, for all I care
That's the feeling I'm looking for
Then she goes a distant way
And I'm still standing, waiting
First love never last, they say
Dream another dream, its over
I took my time, and she's gone
Maybe I'm the one to blame
To lost a true love, how foolish can I be?
I don't even know anymore
Come back to me once more
Raise your head, someone is expecting you.
Is it my destiny, or her unchained melody
Call me a dreamer, for all I care
That's the feeling I'm looking for
Then she goes a distant way
And I'm still standing, waiting
First love never last, they say
Dream another dream, its over
I took my time, and she's gone
Maybe I'm the one to blame
To lost a true love, how foolish can I be
I don't even know anymore
Come back to me once more
Is it my destiny, or her unchained melody
First love never last, they say
Dream another dream, its over
I took my time, and she's gone
Maybe I'm the one to blame
To lost a true love, how foolish can I be
I don't even know anymore
Come back to me once more
Is it my destiny, or her unchained melody
Shit!
Why is he running at full speed?
Maybe he knows our plot!
There's no turning back now!
Get ready!
Turns out that the cops were staging an operation.
We made up a simple story, that Bowl and I saw a streaker.
We tried to stop him, and held up Serpent's escape, just long enough for the cops to nab him.
We were nobody before.
So who'd have thought in the matter of seconds, we became award-winning model citizens!
Hey!
It's showtime!
Judge Bao, I didn't know you're so brave and strong!
Really?
Yeah!
Major Carter, Doctor Jackson, Teal'c.
I'm glad you could make it.
Agent Barrett?
How's Colonel O'Neill doing?
Still recovering.
He's taking some time off.
Well we're still putting the details together here.
If you follow me, I'll explain as we go.
What is this place?
An abandoned industrial complex.
Near as we can tell it was home to a rogue NID sleeper cell we've been trying to locate for over a year now.
- Still haven't got them all?
No.
Not by a long shot Major.
Their ties run deep.
They seem to have infinite resources at their disposal.
What were they doing here?
We're not exactly sure yet.
What happened?
At approximately 08.00 hours this morning we intercepted a 911 call.
We moved in just after local authorities arrived.
We've been in lockdown mode ever since.
Wait a minute.
Someone's running a top secret not to mention illegal NID operation called 911?
- It got real ugly.
Come on.
We got a call from a panicked male voice.
We think it was from a member of the cleaning staff.
The call was cut short.
Thus far we've counted 32 casualties which include the six man security contingent.
- Who would do this?
- And for what reason?
Actually we know who did it.
As for why.
- You know who did this?
- Yeah.
Open it.
It was her.
Season 7 Episode 19 Resurrection
Transcript by stargatedanielfriendly.net
Synchro by Djnono, Nicotr Toutancarton
At first we thought she was a survivor until we founded this.
We found her cowering in the corner.
She seemed to be genuinely terrified and no memory of what happened.
You put her in the cell?
Yes, she said that's where they kept her.
We locked her up after we found the security tapes.
We didn't wanna take any chances.
Who is she?
We're not sure yet.
She's been printed We're running her through the system.
Any other survivors?
Got one.
A scientist named Keffler.
We're holding him upstairs.
So far he hasn't been very talkative.
Come on, let me show you why I called you guys down here.
Wow.
Recognise anything?
Nothing I've catalogued as coming through the SGC.
This indicates it belonged to Sekhmet.
Who was that?
A Goa'uld who at one time was loyal to Ra.
From what we know she was a powerful ally of his.
He would routinely despatch her to rule planets in his stead.
Halt rebellions, mass executions.
You know, all the fun stuff.
Sounds like a real sweetheart.
What happened to her?
It is believed she was exiled for plotting against Ra.
It's also believed she lived here for most of his dynasty.
I didn't realise that this stuff had been recovered.
From what I can gather, it may have come from the Germans.
The Germans?
The background that I have on Keffler suggests that he's the son of a convicted Nazi war criminal.
I guess we really shouldn't be that surprised.
Rogue NID really have no limits do they.
See if there's anything else you can tell me about this stuff.
I'm gonna go back at Keffler again Do you wanna join me?
Sure
Just thought you might wanna watch a master of interrogation at work.
Huh!
You calling in someone special?
Doctor Keffler.
This is Major Samantha Carter.
Of the Stargate program.
That's right.
Are you ready to tell us about the girl?
Look Doctor.
Do I really need to explain the nature of your situation?
Oh please do.
It amuses me.
This was an off the books NID operation.
Which means you technically don't exist.
Which means no phone calls, no lawyers.
Hell, I don't even have to read you your rights.
To make matters worse for you, the people behind the operation are all in jail.
Nobody to bail you out.
What kind of work was being done here Doctor?
You're a smart girl.
You'll figure it out.
Look, do you really think that we are gonna let you walk away from this?
32 people are dead.
Believe it or not, I do feel bad about that.
Some of them were not quite as incompetent as the others.
Unfortunately the bad one's always ruin it for everyone, don't they?
What's this?
That unlocks my car.
Don't think you're safe.
Read the papers Agent Barrett.
No-one is safe these days.
My pills.
Now, now.
Wouldn't want your only witness to die on you, would you.
It's nitro.
Say's he has a bad heart.
I'd say an x-ray would confirm a total absence.
I don't know I think he's starting to crack.
The guy was quoting Hannibal Lector in there.
Still, he's no match for a master interogator.
I didn't see you on his ass.
I didn't wanna step on your toes.
Right.
Come on.
- I've got one more thing to show you.
- There's more?
Trust me, I'm saving the best for last.
This isn't at all creepy.
Oh, it get's better.
They look like partially developed foetus'
They don't look human to me.
Failed experiments of some kind?
What kind is the question.
Well, there's one way to find out.
No, forget it.
Major we've already tried that.
All the codes are encrypted.
I've requested a data retrieval team.
Present and accounted for.
Right, of course.
So how've you been?
Busy, you?
Busy.
You know I never properly thanked you for that memo on Woolsey.
Well, maybe we could go out for dinner sometime.
It's just that I'm seeing someone right now.
Really?
You?
You asked me out.
Yeah, yeah.
Sorry.
I'm gonna go check in on Doctor Jackson and Teal'c.
Most of the artefacts are related in some way to Sekhmet.
I'm guessing they were found here on Earth, possibly in an Egyptian tomb or crypt of some kind.
Nothing of note?
No, I mean it's interesting stuff.
But ah...no, not really.
What's this?
It would appear to be an ark.
Regaling the gold motiff of Ra, Sun God.
Possibly a gift to Sekhmet.
Ok, what's in it?
I don't know we haven't been able to open it.
But umm these turn.
Some sort of combination lock?
So it would seem.
Any luck with the scientist?
No not exactly.
You know the girl, she maybe on tape killing everybody?
But I'm pretty sure that guy up there's not innocent.
Yeah, what about that girl.
She hasn't said anything since we locked her up.
I was kinda hoping that you'd give it a try.
Me?
Heard you got a knack for this type of thing.
Hi, I'm Daniel Jackson.
You're Anna right?
You know when I first saw you,..
.. I didn't believe that you could do the things they said you did.
And even after I saw it for myself, I still don't believe it.
Look, I know you don't know me and you have no reason to trust me but,..
.. I wanna help you.
Before I do that, I need to know a few things first.
I need to know who you are.
What's happened to you.
Why you're here in a cell like this.
Do you even understand me?
I didn't kill those people.
Well there's some pretty overwhelming evidence.
It wasn't me.
Please, you have to believe me.
It wasn't me.
Turn it off.
Turn it off!
Sorry.
I couldn't do those things.
Looks like you did.
It's not me.
Then who is it?
I don't know.
Ok, where were you when this was happening?
If the person on the tape isn't you, where were you?
- What were you doing?
- I don't remember!
Who's Doctor Keffler?
He's the one who made me.
- She say's that Keffler made her.
- What the hell does that mean?
Some sort of genetic research.
No, she's over twenty years old.
The operation hasn't been going on that long.
We know the Asgard can rapidly grow a human clone, but...
Area 51 has a sample of Goa'uld nannite technology from the planet Argos.
It can also rapidly grow a human with the ability to learn very quickly, and the rogue NID would have had access to that.
She also say's that Keffler is responsible for everything that happened.
How?
I don't know.
Do you think she's telling the truth?
To be honest, I don't know what to think.
She certainly believes she didn't do it, says the girl in the videotape isn't her.
Would that be possible?
The NID have cloned a Goa'uld symbiote before.
Right, of course, she could be a clone.
So there could be more than one of her.
How well have you searched this faciltity?
From top to bottom.
I'd better put an APB out to local authorities.
Anna, how long have you lived here?
Since I remember.
Yeah?
How long is that exactly?
I don't know.
You ever have a birthday?
You know a birthday.
A cake with candles on it, funny hats, pin the tail of the donkey, that kind of thing.
He gave me this paper and some new charcoal.
Who, Doctor Keffler?
He always gave me paper, but once, once he said it was my birthday.
Just once.
Have you ever seen anything outside of this room?
Just pictures.
I've read a lot of books which described the world outside.
The mountains, oceans, the sun.
But you've never experienced them firsthand?
What about these?
Those are the things I see in my dreams.
Flashes, they just come to me.
Do they mean anything to you?
Just that they scare me.
If they scare you so much, why do you hang them up everywhere?
I don't want them there.
He hurts me if I take them down.
They're important to him.
Do you have anymore with one of those on it?
Maybe on an arc?
I got it.
It's one of Anna's sketches.
I think it's a combination to open the arc.
Did we just do that?
I do not believe so.
It was activated some time ago.
I've got a picture out to local authorities.
If there's a second girl out there that looks like her, we'll find her.
I'm in, I have complete access.
Nice work.
The files seem to document recent work going back over three years.
Recent work?
The artifacts go all the way back to Napoleon.
The Nazi's eventually recovered them.
They ended up in Keffler's father's hands.
They found a canopic jar.
It's a vessel containing a preserved symbiote.
Keffler spliced human ovum with DNA taken from a Goa'uld.
The girls a human/Goa'uld hybrid.
The Goa'uld pass on their knowledge genetically.
They were trying to create a human who could tell them everything the Goa'uld would know.
They didn't wanna wait either.
They got their nannite technology from area 51.
So they could make it grow up quickly.
It took them 45 failures before they finally got it right.
You can call off that APB.
There's only one of her.
According to this the previous attempts either didn't blend properly or they grew too fast and died.
The technology had to be modified so that the human could slowly learn to gain access to the genetic knowledge buried in the DNA.
My God, they tortured the poor girl.
Sensory deprivation, electrocution.
Major Carter, Agent Barrett.
She's not a clone.
There's only one of her and she's got Goa'uld DNA blended with her own.
That could explain her behaviour and why she doesn't know what she's doing.
The arc is a bomb.
What?
The arc is in fact a Goa'uld explosive device.
And it's been activated.
How much time do we have?
Approximately sixteen hours.
How interesting.
Wipe the smarmy smile off your face and tell me what's going on here!
You're hurting me.
Nothing I do to you could make up for what you've done here.
Agent Barrett!
Listen to her, Agent Barrett.
You are gonna tell me everything that I wanna know or she's not gonna be able to stop me from beating you senseless.
What do you want to know?
For starters, do you know how to de-activate the bomb?
I didn't know it was a bomb.
So, this girl breaks out of her cell.
Kills 32 people, sets a bomb to go off a day from now and then sticks around.
How does that make sense?
Your problem, Agent Barrett.
One among many I must point out is that you see her as a girl.
Look, if you're gonna try and give us some moral justification
- for what's gone on here.
- Please Major.
I know that you have helped orchestrate the death of Goa'ulds before.
Assassinated them in cold blood in fact, without regard for the life of the human host.
I didn't create the problem!
Neither did I!
I am merely trying to help solve it.
The Goa'uld are a terrible threat to us all.
Anna is a device, a conduit, to the knowledge that could level the playing field and I think we all agree that if killing one person could save millions, billions of innocent lives.
You would have no choice.
You would do it.
Answer my question.
- I'm sorry, I've forgotten what it was.
- Why set the bomb and stick around?
Anna did not set that bomb.
Then who did?
The Goa'uld.
Sekhmet.
Now wait a minute.
She doesn't have a symbiote inside of her right?
Something we didn't expect.
separate and distinct personalities.
Are you saying that Anna's mind has created an entirely separate personality that acts like the Goa'uld Sekhmet?
Yes.
But I don't know..
.. if it's that she is capable of dealing with the darkness within her, or that,..
.. that knowledge is so powerful that it's capable of manifesting itself as such.
I only know that it emerges, speaks as a unique entity.
We have witnessed it with a growing frequency.
Anna has no awareness.
To her it is as if she's blacked out.
Ok, so the Goa'uld personality comes out, goes on a rampage, sets the bomb.
And can't stay in control of the body long enough to finish what she began.
Her breakthrough's are sporadic.
Even somewhat uncontrolled.
Still, why set the bomb?
Leverage.
Against what?
Sekhmet only has conscious control of the body for short periods at a time.
She wants more.
She was gonna blackmail you witht he bomb.
Ah the psyche is so simple isn't it, so single minded.
Truly fascinating to behold.
She thinks you can give her that full control.
Can you?
She's the experiment, I'm the observer.
Still, the Goa'uld personality didn't go do something like this on a whim.
You led her to believe that you have the power to give her control of her life.
And I'll bet you did it so she would tell you what you want to know.
How to save us all Major.
I'm not the only one who wants to know.
I don't remember anything.
I know this must be hard for you.
How can you know what this is like for me?
Cos I knew a boy once who was like you.
There are more like me?
Not exactly.
He was born of two Goa'uld hosts.
They call a child like that a Harcesis.
What happened to him?
He was saved by a very powerful being.
He ascended to a higher plane of existence, and when he did he gained great power himself.
He used that power to show me that all the knowledge and memories passed onto him by the Goa'uld genetically,..
.. came with a terrible burden.
And how it was wrong to seek it for any reason.
Can I be saved like him?
Maybe.
Honestly I don't know.
Will you help us shut this bomb off?
I don't know how.
You do.
You knew how to open the arc, it was in your drawings.
I don't remember turning it on.
I know, but somewhere inside your mind is the answer and I can help you find it.
According to these readings there's a ten pound block of Naquadah in this thing.
What's that supposed to mean?
It would be very bad if it went off.
Well it's a bomb right?
I mean usually it's not a good thing when they go off.
True.
Can we move this?
From what I know of Goa'uld weaponry, it would be unwise.
It may have a sensor that would detect such an action.
Yeah.
I don't even want to go there.
Let's...
Let's see if we can disarm it here first.
I'm going to get the local authorities to start evacuating the area.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
How many miles are we talking about here?
I don't know.
How big is orange county?
You're kidding right?
Do I look like a practical joker to you?
Images just come to me.
I draw them.
I don't know what they mean.
Just relax and think about it.
When you look at this, what comes to mind?
The blackouts.
They're happening more and more.
Do you trust me?
Do you trust me?
I want to help you, I don't want to hurt you.
After I help you?
It's not like that.
We have to shut this bomb off.
How many birthdays have you had?
That's not important right now.
You sound just like him.
I heard you were here.
What are you doing?
I notice most of the tapes were labeled, Anna.
It's not just security video footage, it's actually documentation of the research.
Anything useful?
No, just something she said when we were talking.
I reminded her of Keffler.
I need to learn more about how he dealt with her before I pressed her too much.
What are the chances you'll find out how to desactivate the bomb from her.
I don't know.
We're trying to get as much of the area evacuated as we can, we just don't know how big the blast is going to be.
No pressure.
I'll leave now.
You know I'd feel better if you were down there working on the bomb.
Doctor Lee is the best we've got for this and
Teal'c knows more than I do about Goa'uld weapons.
Besides I wanted to see if there was anything more in the research notes that might help.
Like what?
Well, if we can offer Anna a cure for her condition, she might be more willing to help us.
She's been horribly mistreated and without intervention she'd have very little hope of survival.
Now, at the time they made her, they had no idea what her lifespan was going to be.
Based on her current rate of growth, I estimate it won't be more than three years.
Can you help her?
Possibly.
We should at least be able to halt the rapid growth effects of the nannites.
Now I doubt we can unmarry the Goa'uld DNA from hers, but we may be able to block the knowledge from her conscious mind and stop it from possessing her.
We've has some luck with certain drugs in similar situations before.
I suppose the fact that you've has similar situations to this shouldn't come as a total shock?
Anything on your end?
Keffler, he wants to chat.
There is a cure Anna.
You can be a normal girl, with a normal life.
You can be free, or you can continue to suffer.
I don't know anything.
Please stop.
Stop this at once I command you.
Now we're getting somewhere.
Let me out of here.
In due time, freedom can be yours.
You think I will just tell you the secrets of the Goa'uld.
If you want to live.
You will not kill me.
I can make another as easily as I made you.
If it were up to me, given the chance, I would rip the beating heart from your chest and feed it to you.
Such colorful language.
Let's focus on the issue at hand shall we?
Son of a bitch.
We have the same goal.
I do not wish to see my work go to waste.
Look, I know her.
I know how her mind works.
I can get you what you need.
Yeah, I've read about your methods.
I will only talk to her.
You are welcome to be present the entire time.
And what do you want in return?
I can't believe that you'd be doing this solely for the greater good.
My freedom.
Not a chance.
I am guilty of nothing more than trying to save this world, just like you.
We are at war.
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
I've heard that defense.
What choice do you have?
How many people will die if that bomb goes off?
Let's just say we're considering this.
Do you have the authority to offer him immunity?
Trust me, no matter what we decide to do.
No court is ever going to hear about this.
Daniel?
You let her out, didn't you!
You must be Daniel Jackson.
Daniel, what's going on?
He can control when the Goa'uld comes out.
It's not just random.
He's got himself a little remote control.
This?
Yeah, he uses it to shock her.
He can either make the Goa'uld personality appear or he can kill her with it.
Why?
Other scientists going to shut down your research, maybe report your little science experiment?
You have no proof of that.
You used that device to bring out the Goa'uld personality, then you let her out of her cage.
You murdered 32 people.
Speculation.
You can control her with that.
If you didn't want the other scientist dead, why didn't you stop her?
Careful.
Okay.
Just because the cover wasn't booby trapped, it doesn't mean that the crystals themselves are safe to touch.
That is correct.
There's no energy signatures, I don't think there's any force fields or sensors protecting the compartment.
I am unsure.
Which of these crystals would control the detonation of this device?
Well blue is typically for power regulation.
Indeed.
So if we remove the power regulation from the entire control board..
The device could explode.
Yeah, yeah..
I suppose.
I mean it's not like I was going to pull the yellow one.
So obviously letting Keffler anywhere near the girl is out.
And if we're going to get the bomb deactivation code from Anna, you're going to have to do it.
Right.
Okay, so this red crystal seems to control the timer.
Now I should be able to interface with it and hopefully reprogram it.
Anything happening?
The countdown seems to be increasing in speed.
What!
?
Did that stop it?
Yes.
How is it going?
Not well I take it.
Well no, we just had a little setback.
What?
Well, I was trying to interface with one of the control crystals.
The time until detonation is now less then two hours.
Okay, well let's hope that Doctor Jackson is having better luck.
We're trying to evacuate as many people as possible but if that bombs goes off, people are still going to die.
Including us?
We have a helicopter standing by to get us to a safe distance if it comes to that.
I'm hoping it doesn't because a lot of other won't have that luxury.
I've been trying, I can't see anything.
You know not so long ago, I had my memories erased.
How?
It's a long story but the point is... that I was able to access certain lost memories by meditating.
A friend of mine showed me how to do it.
Now I think that can help you.
What I see, scares me so much.
I know, and for a good reason.
Ultimately it's up to you, I can't force you to do this and I won't.
I promise either way that we're going to try to help you.
Make it so that you can live a normal life.
He always said that he could do that.
Well the truth is that I'm not sure if we can, but we're going to try anything and everything in our power.
Okay good. 42 minutes, 15 seconds and counting.
Right, I'll check back, thanks.
We've got ten city blocks in each direction fully evacuated.
That's nowhere near enough.
I know.
I just finished going through the files in the computer.
Even if we halt the rapid growth effect of the nannites, you didn't isolate the gene that carries the Goa'uld genetic knowledge.
We didn't have time to sequence the entire stand.
The goal was to get the intelligence Major, not to create a viable living organism.
I don't understand.
The way you blended the DNA, there's nothing we can do to stop the Goa'uld DNA from eventually taking over.
It will physically overwrite the human and nothing I know of will stop it.
What's going to happen to her?
She'll die, a horrible painful death.
There's no cure, there's no way to save her.
That was just another lie.
I placed a capsule of biotoxin at the base of her brain, the remote device will activate it.
I did this to prevent any undue suffering when the time came.
How humane of you.
What do I do?
Just relax and try thinking of nothing.
Nothing?
Try an empty room.
You see a doorway, go to that door an open it.
Go through, you are inside of a stone room.
The floor is made of polished marble
You're inside of a great pyramid, where innate carvings of giant snakes flank a beautiful golden throne.
You see a window, you walk towards it.
Outside there are thousands of people, slaves who worship you as a God.
You have great power over them, power to decide who lives and who dies.
NO!
- I will tell you nothing.
- Anna?
Anna, stop!
NO!
FIRE!
FIRE!
Hurry, come on!
Hurry!
Daniel, you okay?
Where is she?
She won't get far.
All units, female prisoner is currently unaccounted for.
Secure all exits.
Repeat, secure all exits.
Target is armed and dangerous, use extreme caution.
I don't think she's acting as the Goa'uld.
Daniel!
I just need a drink of water.
Please, I'm...
I'm not feeling 100%.
My pills...
I think it's a deactivation code.
Agent Barrett, this is Major Carter, come in.
What's your location.
Agent Barrett?
This is Major Carter, Agent Barrett needs medical attention.
We are in the north-east corridor, level one.
That's it.. it's off.
I mean the lights turned off, that means it's off right?
Indeed.
Well hey!
Drop the gun.
Anna..
Drop it.
Come with me now,
I will help you.
You can't help me.
Whatever they've told you..
It doesn't matter, I never believed you.
Anna, I did it to help people.
All the evil I have seen in my mind, nothing you put inside of me, compares to what I see in you.
Anna!
What did you do?
You couldn't help me.
I'm so sorry.
(helicopter overhead)
Major Carter, Dr Jackson, Teal'c.
Glad you could make it.
Agent Barrett.
- How's Colonel O'Neill?
- Still recovering.
Taking some time off.
We're still putting the details together.
Follow me.
I'll explain.
- What is this place?
- An abandoned industrial complex.
It was home to a rogue NID sleeper cell we've been trying to locate for over a year.
- Still haven't got them all?
- Not by a long shot.
Their ties run deep.
They seem to have infinite resources.
- What were they doing here?
- We're not exactly sure yet.
What happened?
At approximately 0800 hours this morning, we intercepted a 911 call.
We moved in just after local authorities arrived and have been in lockdown mode.
Somebody from a top-secret, not to mention illegal, NID operation called 911?
It got real ugly.
Come on.
We got a call from a panicked male voice.
We think it was from the cleaning staff.
The call was cut short.
We've counted 32 casualties, which includes a six-man security contingent.
- Who would do this?
- And for what reason?
We know who did it.
As for why...
- You know who did this?
- Yeah.
Open it.
It was her.
At first we thought she was a survivor, and then we found this.
We found her in a corner.
She seemed terrified, no memory of what happened.
- You put her in the cell?
- She said that's where they kept her.
We locked her up after we found the security tapes.
- Who is she?
- We're not sure yet.
She's been printed.
- I'm running her through the system.
- Other survivors?
A scientist, Keffler.
We're holding him upstairs.
He hasn't been very talkative.
Come on, let me show you why I called you guys down here.
Wow.
Recognise anything?
Nothing I've catalogued as coming through the SGC.
- This indicates it belonged to Sekhmet.
- Who was that?
A Goa'uld who at one time was loyal to Ra.
She was a powerful ally of his.
He would dispatch her to rule planets in his stead.
Quell rebellions, oversee executions.
All the fun stuff.
What happened to her?
She was exiled for plotting against Ra.
We also believe she lived here for most of his dynasty.
I didn't realise this had been recovered.
- It may have come from the Germans.
- The Germans?
The background on Keffler says that he's the son of a Nazi war criminal.
- We shouldn't be that surprised.
- Rogue NID have no limits, do they?
See if there's anything else you can tell me about this stuff.
I'm going to go back at Keffler again.
Want to join me?
Sure.
Thought you might want to watch a master of interrogation at work.
You call in someone special?
Dr Keffler.
This is Major Samantha Carter.
Of the Stargate programme.
That's right.
Are you ready to tell us about the girl?
Doctor, do I really need to explain the nature of your situation?
Please do.
It amuses me.
This was an off-the-books NID operation, which means you technically don't exist, which means no phone calls, no lawyers.
I don't even have to read you your rights.
To make matters worse for you, the people behind this operation are all in jail.
Nobody to bail you out.
What kind of work was being done here, Doctor?
You're a smart girl.
You'll figure it out.
Do you think we'll let you walk away from this?
- 32 people are dead.
- Believe it or not, I do feel bad about that.
Some of them were not quite as incompetent as the others.
Unfortunately the bad ones always ruin it for everyone, don't they?
- What's this?
- That unlocks my car.
Don't think you're safe.
Read the papers, Agent Barrett.
No-one is safe these days.
My pills.
Now, now.
You wouldn't want your only witness to die on you, would you?
It's nitro.
Says he has a bad heart.
I'd say an X-ray would confirm a total absence.
- I think he's starting to crack.
- He was colder than Hannibal Lecter.
Still, obviously no match for a master interrogator.
- You didn't get all Clarice Starling on him.
- I didn't want to step on your toes.
- One more thing to show you.
- There's more?
Trust me, I'm saving the best for last.
- This isn't at all creepy.
- It gets better.
They look like partially developed foetuses.
They don't look human to me.
- Failed experiments of some kind?
- "What kind?" is the question.
Well, there's one way to find out.
No.
Forget it.
We've already tried that.
All the codes are encrypted.
- I've requested a data retrieval team.
- Present and accounted for.
Right.
Of course.
- So, how have you been?
- Busy.
You?
Busy.
You know, I never properly thanked you for that memo on Woolsey.
Maybe we could go out for dinner sometime.
- I'm seeing someone right now.
- Really?
You?
- Hm.
- Well, you asked me out.
Yeah.
Right.
Sorry.
I'm going to go check in with Dr Jackson and Teal'c.
Most of the artefacts are related in some way to Sekhmet.
I'm guessing they were found on Earth, possibly in an Egyptian tomb or crypt.
- Nothing of note?
- No, it's interesting stuff, but not really.
- What's this?
- It would appear to be an ark.
Ordained in the gold motif of Ra, the sun god.
Possibly a gift to Sekhmet.
- What's in it?
- We haven't been able to open it.
But these turn.
- Some sort of combination lock?
- So it would seem.
- Any luck with the scientist?
- No, not exactly.
The girl may be on tape killing everybody, but I'm sure that guy is not innocent.
What about that girl?
She hasn't said anything since we locked her up.
I was kind of hoping that you'd give it a try.
Me?
Heard you got a knack for this type of thing.
Hi, I'm Daniel Jackson.
You're Anna, right?
You know, when I first saw you,
I didn't believe that you could do the things they said you did.
And even after I saw it for myself, I still don't believe it.
Look, I know you don't know me and you have no reason to trust me, but...
I want to help you.
Before I do that, I need to know a few things first.
I need to know who you are.
What's happened to you.
Why you're here in a cell like this.
Do you even understand me?
- I didn't kill those people.
- There's some overwhelming evidence.
It wasn't me.
Please, you have to believe me.
It wasn't me.
Turn it off.
Turn it off!
Sorry.
I couldn't do those things.
- It looks like you did.
- It's not me.
- Then who is it?
- I don't know.
OK, where were you when this was happening?
If the person on the tape isn't you, where were you?
I don't remember.
Who is Dr Keffler?
He is the one who made me.
- She says Keffler made her.
- What does that mean?
- Some sort of genetic research?
- No, she's over 20 years old.
The Asgard can rapidly grow a human clone, but...
Area 51 has a sample of Goa'uld nanite technology from the planet Argos.
It can rapidly grow a human with the ability to learn very quickly, and the rogue NID would have had access to that.
She says Keffler is responsible for everything that happened.
- How?
- I don't know.
- Do you think she's telling the truth?
- I don't know what to think.
She believes she didn't do it.
Says the girl on the tape isn't her.
How can that be possible?
The NID have cloned a Goa'uld symbiote before.
- She could be a clone.
- There could be more than one of her.
- How well did you search the facility?
- Top to bottom.
I better put an APB out to local authorities.
Anna, how long have you lived here?
Since I remember.
Yeah?
How long is that, exactly?
I don't know.
Have you ever had a birthday?
You know, a birthday.
A cake with candles on it, funny hats, pin the tail on the donkey, that kind of thing.
He gave me this paper and some new charcoal.
Who, Dr Keffler?
He always gave me paper, but once he said it was my birthday.
Just once?
Have you ever seen anything outside of this room?
Just pictures.
I've read a lot of books which describe the world outside.
The mountains, oceans.
The sun.
But you've never experienced them first-hand?
What about these?
Those are the things I see in my dreams.
Flashes.
- They just come to me.
- Do they mean anything to you?
Just that they scare me.
If they scare you so much, why do you hang them up everywhere?
I don't want them there.
He hurts me if I take them down.
They are important to him.
Do you have any more with one of those on it?
Maybe on an ark?
I got it.
It's one of Anna's sketches.
I think it's a combination to open the ark.
- Did we just do that?
- I do not believe so.
It was activated some time ago.
I got a picture out to local authorities.
If there's a girl that looks like her, we'll find her.
- I'm in.
I have complete access.
- Nice work.
The files seem to document recent work going back over three years.
Recent work?
The artefacts go back to Napoleon.
The Nazis eventually recovered them.
They ended up in Keffler's father's hands.
They found a Canopic jar.
It's a vessel containing a preserved symbiote.
Keffler spliced human ovum with DNA taken from a Goa'uld.
- She is a human-Goa'uld hybrid.
- Goa'uld pass on knowledge genetically.
They tried to create a human who could tell them all a Goa'uld would know.
- They didn't want to wait.
- Nanite technology from Area 51.
So they could make her grow up quickly.
It took them 45 failures before they finally got it right.
- You can call off that APB.
- There's only one of her.
According to this.
The previous attempts either didn't blend properly or they grew too fast and died.
The technology had to be modified so the human could slowly learn to gain access to the genetic knowledge buried in her DNA.
My God.
They tortured the poor girl.
Sensory deprivation, electrocution.
- Major Carter.
Agent Barrett.
- She's not a clone.
There's only one of her and she's got Goa'uld DNA blended with her own.
That could explain her behaviour.
- The ark is a bomb.
- What?
- The ark is a Goa'uld explosive device.
- And it's been activated.
- How much time do we have?
- Approximately 16 hours.
How interesting.
Wipe that smarmy smile off your face and tell me what's going on here!
- You're hurting me.
- Nothing could make up for what you did.
- Agent Barrett.
- Listen to her, Agent Barrett.
You are gonna tell me everything I want to know or I'm gonna beat you senseless.
What do you want to know?
For starters, do you know how to deactivate the bomb?
I didn't know it was a bomb.
So this girl breaks out of her cell, kills 32 people, sets a bomb and then sticks around?
- How does that make sense?
- Your problem, Agent Barrett, one among many, I must point out, is that you see her as a girl.
If you're gonna give us moral justification...
Please, Major.
I know you have helped to orchestrate the death of Goa'ulds before.
Assassinated them in cold blood without regard for the life of the human host.
- I didn't create the problem.
- Neither did I.
I am merely trying to help solve it.
The Goa'uld are a terrible threat to us all.
Anna is a conduit to the knowledge that could level the playing field.
And I think we all agree that if killing one person could save millions, billions of innocent lives, you would have no choice.
You would do it.
- Answer my question.
- I'm sorry, I've forgotten what it was.
Why set the bomb and stick around?
Anna did not set that bomb.
- Then who did?
- The Goa'uld.
Sekhmet.
But wait a minute.
She doesn't have a snake inside of her, right?
It's something we didn't expect.
A separate and distinct personality.
Anna's mind has created a personality that acts like the Goa'uld Sekhmet?
Yes, but I don't know if she is incapable of dealing with the darkness within her, or if that knowledge is so powerful that it is capable of manifesting itself as such.
I only know that it emerges and speaks as a unique entity.
We have witnessed it with a growing frequency.
Anna has no awareness.
To her, it is as if she has blacked out.
The Goa'uld personality comes out, goes on a rampage, sets the bomb...
But can't stay in control of the body long enough.
Her breakthroughs are sporadic and seem somewhat uncontrolled.
- Still, why set the bomb?
- Leverage.
Against what?
Sekhmet has conscious control of the body for short periods.
She wants more.
She was gonna blackmail you with the bomb.
The psyche is so simple, isn't it?
So single-minded.
It's truly fascinating to behold.
She thinks you can give her that full control.
Can you?
She is the experiment.
I am the observer.
The Goa'uld personality didn't go do something like this on a whim.
You led her to believe that you have the power to give her control of her life, and I'll bet you did it so she would tell you what you want to know.
How to save us all, Major.
I'm not the only one who wants to know.
I don't remember anything.
I know this must be hard for you.
How can you know what this is like for me?
Cos I knew a boy once and he was like you.
- There are more like me?
- Not exactly.
He was born of two Goa'uld hosts.
They call a child like that a Harsesis.
- What happened to him?
- He was saved by a very powerful being.
He ascended to a higher plane of existence and, when he did, he gained great power himself.
He used it to show me that the knowledge and memories passed on to him by the Goa'uld genetically came with a terrible burden, and how it was wrong to seek it for any reason.
Can I be saved like him?
Maybe.
Honestly, I don't know.
Will you help us shut this bomb off?
- I don't know how.
- You do.
You knew how to open the ark.
It was in your drawings.
I don't remember turning it on.
I know, but somewhere inside your mind is the answer, and I can help you find it.
(beeping)
According to these readings, there's a ten-pound block of naqahdah in this thing.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It would be very bad if it went off.
It's a bomb.
Usually it's not a good thing when they go off.
Can we move this?
From what I know of Goa'uld weaponry, that would be unwise.
It may have a sensor.
Yeah, I don't even want to go there.
Let's...
Let's see if we can disarm it here.
I'll get the local authorities to evacuate the area.
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- How many miles are we talking about?
I don't know.
How big is Orange County?
You're kidding, right?
Do I look like a practical joker to you?
Images just come to me.
I draw them.
I don't know what they mean.
Just relax and think about it.
When you look at this, what comes to mind?
The blackouts.
They're happening more and more.
Do you trust me?
Do you trust me?
I want to help you.
I don't want to hurt you.
After I help you?
It's not like that.
We have to shut this bomb off.
- How many birthdays have you had?
- That's not important right now.
You sound just like him.
I heard you were in here.
What are you doing?
I noticed most of the tapes were labelled "Anna".
It's not just security footage.
It's documentation of the research.
- Anything useful?
- No.
Just something she said when we were talking, that I reminded her of Keffler.
Figured I needed to learn about how he dealt with her.
What are the chances you'll find out how to deactivate the bomb from her in time?
I don't know.
We're trying to evacuate the area.
We don't know how big the blast will be.
No pressure.
I'll leave now.
I'd feel better if you were down there working on the bomb.
Dr Lee is the best we've got and Teal'c knows more about Goa'uld weapons.
I wanted to see if there was anything more in the research notes that might help.
Like what?
If we can offer Anna a cure for her condition, she might be willing to help us.
She's been horribly mistreated and without intervention she'd have little hope of survival.
At the time they made her, they had no idea what her life span was gonna be.
Based on her current rate of growth, I estimate it can't be more than three years.
- Can you help her?
- Possibly.
We should be able to halt the rapid-growth effects of the nanites.
I doubt we can unmarry the Goa'uld DNA from hers, but we may be able to block the knowledge from her conscious mind.
Stop it from possessing her.
We've had some luck with certain drugs in similar situations.
I suppose the fact that you've had similar situations shouldn't come as a shock.
- Anything on your end?
- Keffler.
He wants to chat.
(Anna screams)
There is a cure, Anna.
You can be a normal girl, live a normal life.
You can be free, or you can continue to suffer.
(screams)
I don't know anything.
Please stop.
- (Sekhmet) Stop this at once.
- Now we're getting somewhere.
- Let me out of here.
- In due time, freedom can be yours.
Do you think I will just tell you the secrets of the Goa'uld?
- If you want to live.
- You will not kill me.
I can make another as easily as I made you.
If it were up to me, given the chance
I would rip the beating heart from your chest and feed it to you.
Such colourful language.
Let's focus on the issue at hand, shall we?
Son of a bitch.
We have the same goal.
I do not wish to see my work go to waste.
Look...
I know her.
I know how her mind works.
I can get you what you need.
Yeah, I've read about your methods.
I will only talk to her.
You are welcome to be present the entire time.
What do you want?
I can't believe you'd be doing this solely for the greater good.
My freedom.
Not a chance.
I am guilty of nothing more than trying to save this world.
Just like you.
We are at war.
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
I've heard that defence.
What choice do you have?
How many people will die if that bomb goes off?
Let's consider this.
Do you have the authority to offer him immunity?
Trust me, no matter what we decide to do, no court is ever gonna hear about this.
Daniel?
- You let her out, didn't you?
- You must be Daniel Jackson.
What's going on?
He can control when the Goa'uld comes out.
It's not just random.
- He's got himself a little remote control.
- This?
Yeah.
He uses it to shock her.
He can make the Goa'uld personality appear, or kill her with it.
Why?
Other scientists gonna shut down your research, report your experiment?
You have no proof.
You brought out the Goa'uld personality, then let her out.
You murdered 32 people.
Speculation.
You can control her with that.
If you didn't want the scientists dead, why didn't you stop her?
Careful.
OK.
Just because the cover wasn't booby-trapped doesn't mean the crystals themselves are safe to touch.
That is correct.
There's no energy signatures.
I don't think there's any force fields or sensors protecting the compartment.
I am unsure which of these crystals would control detonation.
- Blue is typically for power regulation.
- Indeed.
If we remove the power regulation for the control board...
The device could explode.
Yeah.
I suppose.
It's not like I was gonna pull the yellow one.
Obviously letting Keffler anywhere near the girl is out.
And if we're gonna get the bomb deactivation code from Anna, you're gonna have to do it.
Right.
This red crystal seems to control the timer.
Now, I should be able to interface with it and hopefully reprogram it.
- (whirring)
- Anything happening?
- The countdown is increasing in speed.
- What?
Did that stop it?
- Yes.
However...
- Hey, how's it coming?
Not well, I take it?
- No, we just had a little setback.
- What?
I was trying to interface with a control crystal...
The time until detonation is now less than two hours.
OK.
Let's hope that Dr Jackson is having better luck.
They're trying to evacuate people, but if that bomb goes off, people are still gonna die.
Including us?
We have a helicopter standing by to get us to a safe distance if it comes to that.
I'm hoping it doesn't, because a lot of others won't have that luxury.
I've been trying.
I can't see anything.
You know, not so long ago, I had my memories erased.
How?
It's a long story, but I was able to access certain lost memories by meditating.
A friend of mine showed me how to do it.
I think that can help you.
What I see scares me so much.
I know.
And for good reason.
Ultimately it's up to you.
I can't force you to do this and I won't.
And I promise, either way we're gonna try and help you, make it so you can live a normal life.
He always said he could do that.
The truth is, I'm not sure if we can, but we're going to try anything and everything in our power.
OK, good. 42 minutes 15 seconds and counting.
I'll check back.
Thanks.
We've got ten blocks in each direction evacuated.
- That's nowhere near enough.
- I know.
I finished going through the files on the computer.
Even if we halt the nanites' rapid-growth effect, you didn't isolate the gene with the Goa'uld genetic knowledge.
We didn't have time to sequence the entire strand.
The goal was to get the intelligence, not to create a viable living organism.
- I don't understand.
- The way he blended the DNA.
There's nothing we can do to stop the Goa'uld DNA taking over.
It will overwrite the human and nothing I know of will stop it.
- What's going to happen to her?
- She'll die.
A horrible, painful death.
There's no cure, no way to save her.
That was just another lie.
I placed a capsule of biotoxin at the base of her brain.
The remote device will activate it.
I did this to prevent any undue suffering when the time came.
How humane of you.
- What do I do?
- Just relax and try thinking of nothing.
Nothing?
Try an empty room.
You see a doorway.
Go to that door and open it.
Go through.
You're inside of a stone room.
The floor is made of polished marble.
You're inside of a great pyramid.
Ornate carvings of giant snakes flank a beautiful golden throne.
You see a window and you walk towards it.
Outside there are thousands of people.
Slaves who worship you as a god.
You have great power over them.
The power to decide who lives and who dies.
No!
- I will tell you nothing.
- Anna!
Anna, stop!
No!
Fire!
Fire!
Hurry!
Come on!
Hurry!
Daniel.
You OK?
- Where is she?
- She won't get far.
This is Agent Barrett.
The female prisoner is unaccounted for.
Secure all exits.
Secure entire perimeter and begin a full sweep.
Target is armed and dangerous.
Use extreme caution.
Ugh!
I don't think she's acting as the Goa'uld.
Daniel!
I just, uh... need a drink of water.
Please, I'm...
I'm not feeling one hundred per cent.
Agh...
My pills.
Ugh!
I think it's the deactivation code.
Agent Barrett, this is Major Carter.
Come in.
What's your location?
Agent Barrett?
This is Carter.
Agent Barrett needs medical attention.
We are in the northeast corridor, level one.
That's it.
It's off.
I mean, the lights turned off.
That means it's off, right?
Indeed.
Well, hey...
Drop the gun.
- Anna...
- Drop it!
Come with me... now... to the lab.
- I will help you.
- You can't help me.
- Whatever they've told you...
- It doesn't matter.
I never believed you.
Anna, I did it to help people.
All the evil I have seen in my mind, nothing you put inside me compares to what I see in you.
(running footsteps)
(machine-gun fire)
Anna!
What did you do?
You couldn't help me.
I'm so sorry.
Major Carter, Dr Jackson, Teal'c.
Glad you could make it.
Agent Barrett.
- How's Colonel O'Neill?
- Still recovering.
Taking some time off.
We're still putting the details together.
Follow me.
I'll explain.
- What is this place?
- An abandoned industrial complex.
It was home to a rogue NID sleeper cell we've been trying to locate for over a year.
- Still haven't got them all?
- Not by a long shot.
Their ties run deep.
They seem to have infinite resources.
- What were they doing here?
- We're not exactly sure yet.
What happened?
At approximately 0800 hours this morning, we intercepted a 911 call.
We moved in just after local authorities arrived and have been in lockdown mode.
Somebody from a top-secret, not to mention illegal, NID operation called 911?
It got real ugly.
Come on.
We got a call from a panicked male voice.
We think it was from the cleaning staff.
The call was cut short.
We've counted 32 casualties, which includes a six-man security contingent.
- Who would do this?
- And for what reason?
We know who did it.
As for why...
- You know who did this?
- Yeah.
Open it.
It was her.
At first we thought she was a survivor, and then we found this.
We found her in a corner.
She seemed terrified, no memory of what happened.
- You put her in the cell?
- She said that's where they kept her.
We locked her up after we found the security tapes.
- Who is she?
- We're not sure yet.
She's been printed.
- I'm running her through the system.
- Other survivors?
A scientist, Keffler.
We're holding him upstairs.
He hasn't been very talkative.
Come on, let me show you why I called you guys down here.
Wow.
Recognise anything?
Nothing I've catalogued as coming through the SGC.
- This indicates it belonged to Sekhmet.
- Who was that?
A Goa'uld who at one time was loyal to Ra.
She was a powerful ally of his.
He would dispatch her to rule planets in his stead.
Quell rebellions, oversee executions.
All the fun stuff.
What happened to her?
She was exiled for plotting against Ra.
We also believe she lived here for most of his dynasty.
I didn't realise this had been recovered.
- It may have come from the Germans.
- The Germans?
The background on Keffler says that he's the son of a Nazi war criminal.
- We shouldn't be that surprised.
- Rogue NID have no limits, do they?
See if there's anything else you can tell me about this stuff.
I'm going to go back at Keffler again.
Want to join me?
Sure.
Thought you might want to watch a master of interrogation at work.
You call in someone special?
Dr Keffler.
This is Major Samantha Carter.
Of the Stargate programme.
That's right.
Are you ready to tell us about the girl?
Doctor, do I really need to explain the nature of your situation?
Please do.
It amuses me.
This was an off-the-books NID operation, which means you technically don't exist, which means no phone calls, no lawyers.
I don't even have to read you your rights.
To make matters worse for you, the people behind this operation are all in jail.
Nobody to bail you out.
What kind of work was being done here, Doctor?
You're a smart girl.
You'll figure it out.
Do you think we'll let you walk away from this?
- 32 people are dead.
- Believe it or not, I do feel bad about that.
Some of them were not quite as incompetent as the others.
Unfortunately the bad ones always ruin it for everyone, don't they?
- What's this?
- That unlocks my car.
Don't think you're safe.
Read the papers, Agent Barrett.
No-one is safe these days.
My pills.
Now, now.
You wouldn't want your only witness to die on you, would you?
It's nitro.
Says he has a bad heart.
I'd say an X-ray would confirm a total absence.
- I think he's starting to crack.
- He was colder than Hannibal Lecter.
Still, obviously no match for a master interrogator.
- You didn't get all Clarice Starling on him.
- I didn't want to step on your toes.
- One more thing to show you.
- There's more?
Trust me, I'm saving the best for last.
- This isn't at all creepy.
- It gets better.
They look like partially developed foetuses.
They don't look human to me.
- Failed experiments of some kind?
- "What kind?" is the question.
Well, there's one way to find out.
No.
Forget it.
We've already tried that.
All the codes are encrypted.
- I've requested a data retrieval team.
- Present and accounted for.
Right.
Of course.
- So, how have you been?
- Busy.
You?
Busy.
You know, I never properly thanked you for that memo on Woolsey.
Maybe we could go out for dinner sometime.
- I'm seeing someone right now.
- Really?
You?
- Hm.
- Well, you asked me out.
Yeah.
Right.
Sorry.
I'm going to go check in with Dr Jackson and Teal'c.
Most of the artefacts are related in some way to Sekhmet.
I'm guessing they were found on Earth, possibly in an Egyptian tomb or crypt.
- Nothing of note?
- No, it's interesting stuff, but not really.
- What's this?
- It would appear to be an ark.
Ordained in the gold motif of Ra, the sun god.
Possibly a gift to Sekhmet.
- What's in it?
- We haven't been able to open it.
But these turn.
- Some sort of combination lock?
- So it would seem.
- Any luck with the scientist?
- No, not exactly.
The girl may be on tape killing everybody, but I'm sure that guy is not innocent.
What about that girl?
She hasn't said anything since we locked her up.
I was kind of hoping that you'd give it a try.
Me?
Heard you got a knack for this type of thing.
Hi, I'm Daniel Jackson.
You're Anna, right?
You know, when I first saw you,
I didn't believe that you could do the things they said you did.
And even after I saw it for myself, I still don't believe it.
Look, I know you don't know me and you have no reason to trust me, but...
I want to help you.
Before I do that, I need to know a few things first.
I need to know who you are.
What's happened to you.
Why you're here in a cell like this.
Do you even understand me?
- I didn't kill those people.
- There's some overwhelming evidence.
It wasn't me.
Please, you have to believe me.
It wasn't me.
Turn it off.
Turn it off!
Sorry.
I couldn't do those things.
- It looks like you did.
- It's not me.
- Then who is it?
- I don't know.
OK, where were you when this was happening?
If the person on the tape isn't you, where were you?
I don't remember.
Who is Dr Keffler?
He is the one who made me.
- She says Keffler made her.
- What does that mean?
- Some sort of genetic research?
- No, she's over 20 years old.
The Asgard can rapidly grow a human clone, but...
Area 51 has a sample of Goa'uld nanite technology from the planet Argos.
It can rapidly grow a human with the ability to learn very quickly, and the rogue NID would have had access to that.
She says Keffler is responsible for everything that happened.
- How?
- I don't know.
- Do you think she's telling the truth?
- I don't know what to think.
She believes she didn't do it.
Says the girl on the tape isn't her.
How can that be possible?
The NID have cloned a Goa'uld symbiote before.
- She could be a clone.
- There could be more than one of her.
- How well did you search the facility?
- Top to bottom.
I better put an APB out to local authorities.
Anna, how long have you lived here?
Since I remember.
Yeah?
How long is that, exactly?
I don't know.
Have you ever had a birthday?
You know, a birthday.
A cake with candles on it, funny hats, pin the tail on the donkey, that kind of thing.
He gave me this paper and some new charcoal.
Who, Dr Keffler?
He always gave me paper, but once he said it was my birthday.
Just once?
Have you ever seen anything outside of this room?
Just pictures.
I've read a lot of books which describe the world outside.
The mountains, oceans.
The sun.
But you've never experienced them first-hand?
What about these?
Those are the things I see in my dreams.
Flashes.
- They just come to me.
- Do they mean anything to you?
Just that they scare me.
If they scare you so much, why do you hang them up everywhere?
I don't want them there.
He hurts me if I take them down.
They are important to him.
Do you have any more with one of those on it?
Maybe on an ark?
I got it.
It's one of Anna's sketches.
I think it's a combination to open the ark.
- Did we just do that?
- I do not believe so.
It was activated some time ago.
I got a picture out to local authorities.
If there's a girl that looks like her, we'll find her.
- I'm in.
I have complete access.
- Nice work.
The files seem to document recent work going back over three years.
Recent work?
The artefacts go back to Napoleon.
The Nazis eventually recovered them.
They ended up in Keffler's father's hands.
They found a Canopic jar.
It's a vessel containing a preserved symbiote.
Keffler spliced human ovum with DNA taken from a Goa'uld.
- She is a human-Goa'uld hybrid.
- Goa'uld pass on knowledge genetically.
They tried to create a human who could tell them all a Goa'uld would know.
- They didn't want to wait.
- Nanite technology from Area 51.
So they could make her grow up quickly.
It took them 45 failures before they finally got it right.
- You can call off that APB.
- There's only one of her.
According to this.
The previous attempts either didn't blend properly or they grew too fast and died.
The technology had to be modified so the human could slowly learn to gain access to the genetic knowledge buried in her DNA.
My God.
They tortured the poor girl.
Sensory deprivation, electrocution.
- Major Carter.
Agent Barrett.
- She's not a clone.
There's only one of her and she's got Goa'uld DNA blended with her own.
That could explain her behaviour.
- The ark is a bomb.
- What?
- The ark is a Goa'uld explosive device.
- And it's been activated.
- How much time do we have?
- Approximately 16 hours.
How interesting.
Wipe that smarmy smile off your face and tell me what's going on here!
- You're hurting me.
- Nothing could make up for what you did.
- Agent Barrett.
- Listen to her, Agent Barrett.
You are gonna tell me everything I want to know or I'm gonna beat you senseless.
What do you want to know?
For starters, do you know how to deactivate the bomb?
I didn't know it was a bomb.
So this girl breaks out of her cell, kills 32 people, sets a bomb and then sticks around?
- How does that make sense?
- Your problem, Agent Barrett, one among many, I must point out, is that you see her as a girl.
If you're gonna give us moral justification...
Please, Major.
I know you have helped to orchestrate the death of Goa'ulds before.
Assassinated them in cold blood without regard for the life of the human host.
- I didn't create the problem.
- Neither did I.
I am merely trying to help solve it.
The Goa'uld are a terrible threat to us all.
Anna is a conduit to the knowledge that could level the playing field.
And I think we all agree that if killing one person could save millions, billions of innocent lives, you would have no choice.
You would do it.
- Answer my question.
- I'm sorry, I've forgotten what it was.
Why set the bomb and stick around?
Anna did not set that bomb.
- Then who did?
- The Goa'uld.
Sekhmet.
But wait a minute.
She doesn't have a snake inside of her, right?
It's something we didn't expect.
A separate and distinct personality.
Anna's mind has created a personality that acts like the Goa'uld Sekhmet?
Yes, but I don't know if she is incapable of dealing with the darkness within her, or if that knowledge is so powerful that it is capable of manifesting itself as such.
I only know that it emerges and speaks as a unique entity.
We have witnessed it with a growing frequency.
Anna has no awareness.
To her, it is as if she has blacked out.
The Goa'uld personality comes out, goes on a rampage, sets the bomb...
But can't stay in control of the body long enough.
Her breakthroughs are sporadic and seem somewhat uncontrolled.
- Still, why set the bomb?
- Leverage.
Against what?
Sekhmet has conscious control of the body for short periods.
She wants more.
She was gonna blackmail you with the bomb.
The psyche is so simple, isn't it?
So single-minded.
It's truly fascinating to behold.
She thinks you can give her that full control.
Can you?
She is the experiment.
I am the observer.
The Goa'uld personality didn't go do something like this on a whim.
You led her to believe that you have the power to give her control of her life, and I'll bet you did it so she would tell you what you want to know.
How to save us all, Major.
I'm not the only one who wants to know.
I don't remember anything.
I know this must be hard for you.
How can you know what this is like for me?
Cos I knew a boy once and he was like you.
- There are more like me?
- Not exactly.
He was born of two Goa'uld hosts.
They call a child like that a Harsesis.
- What happened to him?
- He was saved by a very powerful being.
He ascended to a higher plane of existence and, when he did, he gained great power himself.
He used it to show me that the knowledge and memories passed on to him by the Goa'uld genetically came with a terrible burden, and how it was wrong to seek it for any reason.
Can I be saved like him?
Maybe.
Honestly, I don't know.
Will you help us shut this bomb off?
- I don't know how.
- You do.
You knew how to open the ark.
It was in your drawings.
I don't remember turning it on.
I know, but somewhere inside your mind is the answer, and I can help you find it.
According to these readings, there's a ten-pound block of naqahdah in this thing.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It would be very bad if it went off.
It's a bomb.
Usually it's not a good thing when they go off.
Can we move this?
From what I know of Goa'uld weaponry, that would be unwise.
It may have a sensor.
Yeah, I don't even want to go there.
Let's...
Let's see if we can disarm it here.
I'll get the local authorities to evacuate the area.
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- How many miles are we talking about?
I don't know.
How big is Orange County?
You're kidding, right?
Do I look like a practical joker to you?
Images just come to me.
I draw them.
I don't know what they mean.
Just relax and think about it.
When you look at this, what comes to mind?
The blackouts.
They're happening more and more.
Do you trust me?
Do you trust me?
I want to help you.
I don't want to hurt you.
After I help you?
It's not like that.
We have to shut this bomb off.
- How many birthdays have you had?
- That's not important right now.
You sound just like him.
I heard you were in here.
What are you doing?
I noticed most of the tapes were labelled "Anna".
It's not just security footage.
It's documentation of the research.
- Anything useful?
- No.
Just something she said when we were talking, that I reminded her of Keffler.
Figured I needed to learn about how he dealt with her.
What are the chances you'll find out how to deactivate the bomb from her in time?
I don't know.
We're trying to evacuate the area.
We don't know how big the blast will be.
No pressure.
I'll leave now.
I'd feel better if you were down there working on the bomb.
Dr Lee is the best we've got and Teal'c knows more about Goa'uld weapons.
I wanted to see if there was anything more in the research notes that might help.
Like what?
If we can offer Anna a cure for her condition, she might be willing to help us.
She's been horribly mistreated and without intervention she'd have little hope of survival.
At the time they made her, they had no idea what her life span was gonna be.
Based on her current rate of growth, I estimate it can't be more than three years.
- Can you help her?
- Possibly.
We should be able to halt the rapid-growth effects of the nanites.
I doubt we can unmarry the Goa'uld DNA from hers, but we may be able to block the knowledge from her conscious mind.
Stop it from possessing her.
We've had some luck with certain drugs in similar situations.
I suppose the fact that you've had similar situations shouldn't come as a shock.
- Anything on your end?
- Keffler.
He wants to chat.
There is a cure, Anna.
You can be a normal girl, live a normal life.
You can be free, or you can continue to suffer.
I don't know anything.
Please stop.
- Stop this at once.
- Now we're getting somewhere.
- Let me out of here.
- In due time, freedom can be yours.
Do you think I will just tell you the secrets of the Goa'uld?
- If you want to live.
- You will not kill me.
I can make another as easily as I made you.
If it were up to me, given the chance
I would rip the beating heart from your chest and feed it to you.
Such colourful language.
Let's focus on the issue at hand, shall we?
Son of a bitch.
We have the same goal.
I do not wish to see my work go to waste.
Look...
I know her.
I know how her mind works.
I can get you what you need.
Yeah, I've read about your methods.
I will only talk to her.
You are welcome to be present the entire time.
What do you want?
I can't believe you'd be doing this solely for the greater good.
My freedom.
Not a chance.
I am guilty of nothing more than trying to save this world.
Just like you.
We are at war.
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
I've heard that defence.
What choice do you have?
How many people will die if that bomb goes off?
Let's consider this.
Do you have the authority to offer him immunity?
Trust me, no matter what we decide to do, no court is ever gonna hear about this.
Daniel?
- You let her out, didn't you?
- You must be Daniel Jackson.
What's going on?
He can control when the Goa'uld comes out.
It's not just random.
- He's got himself a little remote control.
- This?
Yeah.
He uses it to shock her.
He can make the Goa'uld personality appear, or kill her with it.
Why?
Other scientists gonna shut down your research, report your experiment?
You have no proof.
You brought out the Goa'uld personality, then let her out.
You murdered 32 people.
Speculation.
You can control her with that.
If you didn't want the scientists dead, why didn't you stop her?
Careful.
OK.
Just because the cover wasn't booby-trapped doesn't mean the crystals themselves are safe to touch.
That is correct.
There's no energy signatures.
I don't think there's any force fields or sensors protecting the compartment.
I am unsure which of these crystals would control detonation.
- Blue is typically for power regulation.
- Indeed.
If we remove the power regulation for the control board...
The device could explode.
Yeah.
I suppose.
It's not like I was gonna pull the yellow one.
Obviously letting Keffler anywhere near the girl is out.
And if we're gonna get the bomb deactivation code from Anna, you're gonna have to do it.
Right.
This red crystal seems to control the timer.
Now, I should be able to interface with it and hopefully reprogram it.
Anything happening?
- The countdown is increasing in speed.
- What?
Did that stop it?
- Yes.
However...
- Hey, how's it coming?
Not well, I take it?
- No, we just had a little setback.
- What?
I was trying to interface with a control crystal...
The time until detonation is now less than two hours.
OK.
Let's hope that Dr Jackson is having better luck.
They're trying to evacuate people, but if that bomb goes off, people are still gonna die.
Including us?
We have a helicopter standing by to get us to a safe distance if it comes to that.
I'm hoping it doesn't, because a lot of others won't have that luxury.
I've been trying.
I can't see anything.
You know, not so long ago, I had my memories erased.
How?
It's a long story, but I was able to access certain lost memories by meditating.
A friend of mine showed me how to do it.
I think that can help you.
What I see scares me so much.
I know.
And for good reason.
Ultimately it's up to you.
I can't force you to do this and I won't.
And I promise, either way we're gonna try and help you, make it so you can live a normal life.
He always said he could do that.
The truth is, I'm not sure if we can, but we're going to try anything and everything in our power.
OK, good. 42 minutes 15 seconds and counting.
I'll check back.
Thanks.
We've got ten blocks in each direction evacuated.
- That's nowhere near enough.
- I know.
I finished going through the files on the computer.
Even if we halt the nanites' rapid-growth effect, you didn't isolate the gene with the Goa'uld genetic knowledge.
We didn't have time to sequence the entire strand.
The goal was to get the intelligence, not to create a viable living organism.
- I don't understand.
- The way he blended the DNA.
There's nothing we can do to stop the Goa'uld DNA taking over.
It will overwrite the human and nothing I know of will stop it.
- What's going to happen to her?
- She'll die.
A horrible, painful death.
There's no cure, no way to save her.
That was just another lie.
I placed a capsule of biotoxin at the base of her brain.
The remote device will activate it.
I did this to prevent any undue suffering when the time came.
How humane of you.
- What do I do?
- Just relax and try thinking of nothing.
Nothing?
Try an empty room.
You see a doorway.
Go to that door and open it.
Go through.
You're inside of a stone room.
The floor is made of polished marble.
You're inside of a great pyramid.
Ornate carvings of giant snakes flank a beautiful golden throne.
You see a window and you walk towards it.
Outside there are thousands of people.
Slaves who worship you as a god.
You have great power over them.
The power to decide who lives and who dies.
No!
- I will tell you nothing.
- Anna!
Anna, stop!
No!
Fire!
Fire!
Hurry!
Come on!
Hurry!
Daniel.
You OK?
- Where is she?
- She won't get far.
This is Agent Barrett.
The female prisoner is unaccounted for.
Secure all exits.
Secure entire perimeter and begin a full sweep.
Target is armed and dangerous.
Use extreme caution.
Ugh!
I don't think she's acting as the Goa'uld.
Daniel!
I just, uh... need a drink of water.
Please, I'm...
I'm not feeling one hundred per cent.
Agh...
My pills.
Ugh!
I think it's the deactivation code.
Agent Barrett, this is Major Carter.
Come in.
What's your location?
Agent Barrett?
This is Carter.
Agent Barrett needs medical attention.
We are in the northeast corridor, level one.
That's it.
It's off.
I mean, the lights turned off.
That means it's off, right?
Indeed.
Well, hey...
Drop the gun.
- Anna...
- Drop it!
Come with me... now... to the lab.
- I will help you.
- You can't help me.
- Whatever they've told you...
- It doesn't matter.
I never believed you.
Anna, I did it to help people.
All the evil I have seen in my mind, nothing you put inside me compares to what I see in you.
Anna!
What did you do?
You couldn't help me.
I'm so sorry.
Agent Barrett?
How's Colonel O'Neill doing?
Still recovering.
He's taking some time off.
Well we're still putting the details together here.
If you follow me, I'll explain as we go.
What is this place?
An abandoned industrial complex.
Near as we can tell it was home to a rogue NID sleeper cell we've been trying to locate for over a year now.
- Still haven't got them all?
No.
Not by a long shot Major.
Their ties run deep.
They seem to have infinite resources at their disposal.
What were they doing here?
We're not exactly sure yet.
What happened?
At approximately 08.00 hours this morning we intercepted a 911 call.
We moved in just after local authorities arrived.
We've been in lockdown mode ever since.
Wait a minute.
Someone's running a top secret not to mention illegal NID operation called 911?
- It got real ugly.
Come on.
We got a call from a panicked male voice.
We think it was from a member of the cleaning staff.
The call was cut short.
Thus far we've counted 32 casualties which include the six man security contingent.
- Who would do this?
- And for what reason?
Actually we know who did it.
As for why.
- You know who did this?
- Yeah.
Open it.
It was her.
Season 7 Episode 19 Resurrection
Transcript by stargatedanielfriendly.net
Synchro by Djnono, Nicotr Toutancarton
At first we thought she was a survivor until we founded this.
We found her cowering in the corner.
She seemed to be genuinely terrified and no memory of what happened.
You put her in the cell?
Yes, she said that's where they kept her.
We locked her up after we found the security tapes.
We didn't wanna take any chances.
Who is she?
We're not sure yet.
She's been printed We're running her through the system.
Any other survivors?
Got one.
A scientist named Keffler.
We're holding him upstairs.
So far he hasn't been very talkative.
Come on, let me show you why I called you guys down here.
Wow.
Recognise anything?
Nothing I've catalogued as coming through the SGC.
This indicates it belonged to Sekhmet.
Who was that?
A Goa'uld who at one time was loyal to Ra.
From what we know she was a powerful ally of his.
He would routinely despatch her to rule planets in his stead.
Halt rebellions, mass executions.
You know, all the fun stuff.
Sounds like a real sweetheart.
What happened to her?
It is believed she was exiled for plotting against Ra.
It's also believed she lived here for most of his dynasty.
I didn't realise that this stuff had been recovered.
From what I can gather, it may have come from the Germans.
The Germans?
The background that I have on Keffler suggests that he's the son of a convicted Nazi war criminal.
I guess we really shouldn't be that surprised.
Rogue NID really have no limits do they.
See if there's anything else you can tell me about this stuff.
I'm gonna go back at Keffler again Do you wanna join me?
Sure
Just thought you might wanna watch a master of interrogation at work.
Huh!
You calling in someone special?
Doctor Keffler.
This is Major Samantha Carter.
Of the Stargate program.
That's right.
Are you ready to tell us about the girl?
Look Doctor.
Do I really need to explain the nature of your situation?
Oh please do.
It amuses me.
This was an off the books NID operation.
Which means you technically don't exist.
Which means no phone calls, no lawyers.
Hell, I don't even have to read you your rights.
To make matters worse for you, the people behind the operation are all in jail.
Nobody to bail you out.
What kind of work was being done here Doctor?
You're a smart girl.
You'll figure it out.
Look, do you really think that we are gonna let you walk away from this?
32 people are dead.
Believe it or not, I do feel bad about that.
Some of them were not quite as incompetent as the others.
Unfortunately the bad one's always ruin it for everyone, don't they?
What's this?
That unlocks my car.
Don't think you're safe.
Read the papers Agent Barrett.
No-one is safe these days.
My pills.
Now, now.
Wouldn't want your only witness to die on you, would you.
It's nitro.
Say's he has a bad heart.
I'd say an x-ray would confirm a total absence.
I don't know I think he's starting to crack.
The guy was quoting Hannibal Lector in there.
Still, he's no match for a master interogator.
I didn't see you on his ass.
I didn't wanna step on your toes.
Right.
Come on.
- I've got one more thing to show you.
- There's more?
Trust me, I'm saving the best for last.
This isn't at all creepy.
Oh, it get's better.
They look like partially developed foetus'
They don't look human to me.
Failed experiments of some kind?
What kind is the question.
Well, there's one way to find out.
No, forget it.
Major we've already tried that.
All the codes are encrypted.
I've requested a data retrieval team.
Present and accounted for.
Right, of course.
So how've you been?
Busy, you?
Busy.
You know I never properly thanked you for that memo on Woolsey.
Well, maybe we could go out for dinner sometime.
It's just that I'm seeing someone right now.
Really?
You?
You asked me out.
Yeah, yeah.
Sorry.
I'm gonna go check in on Doctor Jackson and Teal'c.
Most of the artefacts are related in some way to Sekhmet.
I'm guessing they were found here on Earth, possibly in an Egyptian tomb or crypt of some kind.
Nothing of note?
No, I mean it's interesting stuff.
But ah...no, not really.
What's this?
It would appear to be an ark.
Regaling the gold motiff of Ra, Sun God.
Possibly a gift to Sekhmet.
Ok, what's in it?
I don't know we haven't been able to open it.
But umm these turn.
Some sort of combination lock?
So it would seem.
Any luck with the scientist?
No not exactly.
You know the girl, she maybe on tape killing everybody?
But I'm pretty sure that guy up there's not innocent.
Yeah, what about that girl.
She hasn't said anything since we locked her up.
I was kinda hoping that you'd give it a try.
Me?
Heard you got a knack for this type of thing.
Hi, I'm Daniel Jackson.
You're Anna right?
You know when I first saw you,..
.. I didn't believe that you could do the things they said you did.
And even after I saw it for myself, I still don't believe it.
Look, I know you don't know me and you have no reason to trust me but,..
.. I wanna help you.
Before I do that, I need to know a few things first.
I need to know who you are.
What's happened to you.
Why you're here in a cell like this.
Do you even understand me?
I didn't kill those people.
Well there's some pretty overwhelming evidence.
It wasn't me.
Please, you have to believe me.
It wasn't me.
Turn it off.
Turn it off!
Sorry.
I couldn't do those things.
Looks like you did.
It's not me.
Then who is it?
I don't know.
Ok, where were you when this was happening?
If the person on the tape isn't you, where were you?
- What were you doing?
- I don't remember!
Who's Doctor Keffler?
He's the one who made me.
- She say's that Keffler made her.
- What the hell does that mean?
Some sort of genetic research.
No, she's over twenty years old.
The operation hasn't been going on that long.
We know the Asgard can rapidly grow a human clone, but...
Area 51 has a sample of Goa'uld nannite technology from the planet Argos.
It can also rapidly grow a human with the ability to learn very quickly, and the rogue NID would have had access to that.
She also say's that Keffler is responsible for everything that happened.
How?
I don't know.
Do you think she's telling the truth?
To be honest, I don't know what to think.
She certainly believes she didn't do it, says the girl in the videotape isn't her.
Would that be possible?
The NID have cloned a Goa'uld symbiote before.
Right, of course, she could be a clone.
So there could be more than one of her.
How well have you searched this faciltity?
From top to bottom.
I'd better put an APB out to local authorities.
Anna, how long have you lived here?
Since I remember.
Yeah?
How long is that exactly?
I don't know.
You ever have a birthday?
You know a birthday.
A cake with candles on it, funny hats, pin the tail of the donkey, that kind of thing.
He gave me this paper and some new charcoal.
Who, Doctor Keffler?
He always gave me paper, but once, once he said it was my birthday.
Just once.
Have you ever seen anything outside of this room?
Just pictures.
I've read a lot of books which described the world outside.
The mountains, oceans, the sun.
But you've never experienced them firsthand?
What about these?
Those are the things I see in my dreams.
Flashes, they just come to me.
Do they mean anything to you?
Just that they scare me.
If they scare you so much, why do you hang them up everywhere?
I don't want them there.
He hurts me if I take them down.
They're important to him.
Do you have anymore with one of those on it?
Maybe on an arc?
I got it.
It's one of Anna's sketches.
I think it's a combination to open the arc.
Did we just do that?
I do not believe so.
It was activated some time ago.
I've got a picture out to local authorities.
If there's a second girl out there that looks like her, we'll find her.
I'm in, I have complete access.
Nice work.
The files seem to document recent work going back over three years.
Recent work?
The artifacts go all the way back to Napoleon.
The Nazi's eventually recovered them.
They ended up in Keffler's father's hands.
They found a canopic jar.
It's a vessel containing a preserved symbiote.
Keffler spliced human ovum with DNA taken from a Goa'uld.
The girls a human/Goa'uld hybrid.
The Goa'uld pass on their knowledge genetically.
They were trying to create a human who could tell them everything the Goa'uld would know.
They didn't wanna wait either.
They got their nannite technology from area 51.
So they could make it grow up quickly.
It took them 45 failures before they finally got it right.
You can call off that APB.
There's only one of her.
According to this the previous attempts either didn't blend properly or they grew too fast and died.
The technology had to be modified so that the human could slowly learn to gain access to the genetic knowledge buried in the DNA.
My God, they tortured the poor girl.
Sensory deprivation, electrocution.
Major Carter, Agent Barrett.
She's not a clone.
There's only one of her and she's got Goa'uld DNA blended with her own.
That could explain her behaviour and why she doesn't know what she's doing.
The arc is a bomb.
What?
The arc is in fact a Goa'uld explosive device.
And it's been activated.
How much time do we have?
Approximately sixteen hours.
How interesting.
Wipe the smarmy smile off your face and tell me what's going on here!
You're hurting me.
Nothing I do to you could make up for what you've done here.
Agent Barrett!
Listen to her, Agent Barrett.
You are gonna tell me everything that I wanna know or she's not gonna be able to stop me from beating you senseless.
What do you want to know?
For starters, do you know how to de-activate the bomb?
I didn't know it was a bomb.
So, this girl breaks out of her cell.
Kills 32 people, sets a bomb to go off a day from now and then sticks around.
How does that make sense?
Your problem, Agent Barrett.
One among many I must point out is that you see her as a girl.
Look, if you're gonna try and give us some moral justification
- for what's gone on here.
- Please Major.
I know that you have helped orchestrate the death of Goa'ulds before.
Assassinated them in cold blood in fact, without regard for the life of the human host.
I didn't create the problem!
Neither did I!
I am merely trying to help solve it.
The Goa'uld are a terrible threat to us all.
Anna is a device, a conduit, to the knowledge that could level the playing field and I think we all agree that if killing one person could save millions, billions of innocent lives.
You would have no choice.
You would do it.
Answer my question.
- I'm sorry, I've forgotten what it was.
- Why set the bomb and stick around?
Anna did not set that bomb.
Then who did?
The Goa'uld.
Sekhmet.
Now wait a minute.
She doesn't have a symbiote inside of her right?
Something we didn't expect.
separate and distinct personalities.
Are you saying that Anna's mind has created an entirely separate personality that acts like the Goa'uld Sekhmet?
Yes.
But I don't know..
.. if it's that she is capable of dealing with the darkness within her, or that,..
.. that knowledge is so powerful that it's capable of manifesting itself as such.
I only know that it emerges, speaks as a unique entity.
We have witnessed it with a growing frequency.
Anna has no awareness.
To her it is as if she's blacked out.
Ok, so the Goa'uld personality comes out, goes on a rampage, sets the bomb.
And can't stay in control of the body long enough to finish what she began.
Her breakthrough's are sporadic.
Even somewhat uncontrolled.
Still, why set the bomb?
Leverage.
Against what?
Sekhmet only has conscious control of the body for short periods at a time.
She wants more.
She was gonna blackmail you witht he bomb.
Ah the psyche is so simple isn't it, so single minded.
Truly fascinating to behold.
She thinks you can give her that full control.
Can you?
She's the experiment, I'm the observer.
Still, the Goa'uld personality didn't go do something like this on a whim.
You led her to believe that you have the power to give her control of her life.
And I'll bet you did it so she would tell you what you want to know.
How to save us all Major.
I'm not the only one who wants to know.
I don't remember anything.
I know this must be hard for you.
How can you know what this is like for me?
Cos I knew a boy once who was like you.
There are more like me?
Not exactly.
He was born of two Goa'uld hosts.
They call a child like that a Harcesis.
What happened to him?
He was saved by a very powerful being.
He ascended to a higher plane of existence, and when he did he gained great power himself.
He used that power to show me that all the knowledge and memories passed onto him by the Goa'uld genetically,..
.. came with a terrible burden.
And how it was wrong to seek it for any reason.
Can I be saved like him?
Maybe.
Honestly I don't know.
Will you help us shut this bomb off?
I don't know how.
You do.
You knew how to open the arc, it was in your drawings.
I don't remember turning it on.
I know, but somewhere inside your mind is the answer and I can help you find it.
According to these readings there's a ten pound block of Naquadah in this thing.
What's that supposed to mean?
It would be very bad if it went off.
Well it's a bomb right?
I mean usually it's not a good thing when they go off.
True.
Can we move this?
From what I know of Goa'uld weaponry, it would be unwise.
It may have a sensor that would detect such an action.
Yeah.
I don't even want to go there.
Let's...
Let's see if we can disarm it here first.
I'm going to get the local authorities to start evacuating the area.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
How many miles are we talking about here?
I don't know.
How big is orange county?
You're kidding right?
Do I look like a practical joker to you?
Images just come to me.
I draw them.
I don't know what they mean.
Just relax and think about it.
When you look at this, what comes to mind?
The blackouts.
They're happening more and more.
Do you trust me?
Do you trust me?
I want to help you, I don't want to hurt you.
After I help you?
It's not like that.
We have to shut this bomb off.
How many birthdays have you had?
That's not important right now.
You sound just like him.
I heard you were here.
What are you doing?
I notice most of the tapes were labeled, Anna.
It's not just security video footage, it's actually documentation of the research.
Anything useful?
No, just something she said when we were talking.
I reminded her of Keffler.
I need to learn more about how he dealt with her before I pressed her too much.
What are the chances you'll find out how to desactivate the bomb from her.
I don't know.
We're trying to get as much of the area evacuated as we can, we just don't know how big the blast is going to be.
No pressure.
I'll leave now.
You know I'd feel better if you were down there working on the bomb.
Doctor Lee is the best we've got for this and
Teal'c knows more than I do about Goa'uld weapons.
Besides I wanted to see if there was anything more in the research notes that might help.
Like what?
Well, if we can offer Anna a cure for her condition, she might be more willing to help us.
She's been horribly mistreated and without intervention she'd have very little hope of survival.
Now, at the time they made her, they had no idea what her lifespan was going to be.
Based on her current rate of growth, I estimate it won't be more than three years.
Can you help her?
Possibly.
We should at least be able to halt the rapid growth effects of the nannites.
Now I doubt we can unmarry the Goa'uld DNA from hers, but we may be able to block the knowledge from her conscious mind and stop it from possessing her.
We've has some luck with certain drugs in similar situations before.
I suppose the fact that you've has similar situations to this shouldn't come as a total shock?
Anything on your end?
Keffler, he wants to chat.
There is a cure Anna.
You can be a normal girl, with a normal life.
You can be free, or you can continue to suffer.
I don't know anything.
Please stop.
Stop this at once I command you.
Now we're getting somewhere.
Let me out of here.
In due time, freedom can be yours.
You think I will just tell you the secrets of the Goa'uld.
If you want to live.
You will not kill me.
I can make another as easily as I made you.
If it were up to me, given the chance, I would rip the beating heart from your chest and feed it to you.
Such colorful language.
Let's focus on the issue at hand shall we?
Son of a bitch.
We have the same goal.
I do not wish to see my work go to waste.
Look, I know her.
I know how her mind works.
I can get you what you need.
Yeah, I've read about your methods.
I will only talk to her.
You are welcome to be present the entire time.
And what do you want in return?
I can't believe that you'd be doing this solely for the greater good.
My freedom.
Not a chance.
I am guilty of nothing more than trying to save this world, just like you.
We are at war.
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
I've heard that defense.
What choice do you have?
How many people will die if that bomb goes off?
Let's just say we're considering this.
Do you have the authority to offer him immunity?
Trust me, no matter what we decide to do.
No court is ever going to hear about this.
Daniel?
You let her out, didn't you!
You must be Daniel Jackson.
Daniel, what's going on?
He can control when the Goa'uld comes out.
It's not just random.
He's got himself a little remote control.
This?
Yeah, he uses it to shock her.
He can either make the Goa'uld personality appear or he can kill her with it.
Why?
Other scientists going to shut down your research, maybe report your little science experiment?
You have no proof of that.
You used that device to bring out the Goa'uld personality, then you let her out of her cage.
You murdered 32 people.
Speculation.
You can control her with that.
If you didn't want the other scientist dead, why didn't you stop her?
Careful.
Okay.
Just because the cover wasn't booby trapped, it doesn't mean that the crystals themselves are safe to touch.
That is correct.
There's no energy signatures, I don't think there's any force fields or sensors protecting the compartment.
I am unsure.
Which of these crystals would control the detonation of this device?
Well blue is typically for power regulation.
Indeed.
So if we remove the power regulation from the entire control board..
The device could explode.
Yeah, yeah..
I suppose.
I mean it's not like I was going to pull the yellow one.
So obviously letting Keffler anywhere near the girl is out.
And if we're going to get the bomb deactivation code from Anna, you're going to have to do it.
Right.
Okay, so this red crystal seems to control the timer.
Now I should be able to interface with it and hopefully reprogram it.
Anything happening?
The countdown seems to be increasing in speed.
What!
?
Did that stop it?
Yes.
How is it going?
Not well I take it.
Well no, we just had a little setback.
What?
Well, I was trying to interface with one of the control crystals.
The time until detonation is now less then two hours.
Okay, well let's hope that Doctor Jackson is having better luck.
We're trying to evacuate as many people as possible but if that bombs goes off, people are still going to die.
Including us?
We have a helicopter standing by to get us to a safe distance if it comes to that.
I'm hoping it doesn't because a lot of other won't have that luxury.
I've been trying, I can't see anything.
You know not so long ago, I had my memories erased.
How?
It's a long story but the point is... that I was able to access certain lost memories by meditating.
A friend of mine showed me how to do it.
Now I think that can help you.
What I see, scares me so much.
I know, and for a good reason.
Ultimately it's up to you, I can't force you to do this and I won't.
I promise either way that we're going to try to help you.
Make it so that you can live a normal life.
He always said that he could do that.
Well the truth is that I'm not sure if we can, but we're going to try anything and everything in our power.
Okay good. 42 minutes, 15 seconds and counting.
Right, I'll check back, thanks.
We've got ten city blocks in each direction fully evacuated.
That's nowhere near enough.
I know.
I just finished going through the files in the computer.
Even if we halt the rapid growth effect of the nannites, you didn't isolate the gene that carries the Goa'uld genetic knowledge.
We didn't have time to sequence the entire stand.
The goal was to get the intelligence Major, not to create a viable living organism.
I don't understand.
The way you blended the DNA, there's nothing we can do to stop the Goa'uld DNA from eventually taking over.
It will physically overwrite the human and nothing I know of will stop it.
What's going to happen to her?
She'll die, a horrible painful death.
There's no cure, there's no way to save her.
That was just another lie.
I placed a capsule of biotoxin at the base of her brain, the remote device will activate it.
I did this to prevent any undue suffering when the time came.
How humane of you.
What do I do?
Just relax and try thinking of nothing.
Nothing?
Try an empty room.
You see a doorway, go to that door an open it.
Go through, you are inside of a stone room.
The floor is made of polished marble
You're inside of a great pyramid, where innate carvings of giant snakes flank a beautiful golden throne.
You see a window, you walk towards it.
Outside there are thousands of people, slaves who worship you as a God.
You have great power over them, power to decide who lives and who dies.
NO!
- I will tell you nothing.
- Anna?
Anna, stop!
NO!
FIRE!
FIRE!
Hurry, come on!
Hurry!
Daniel, you okay?
Where is she?
She won't get far.
All units, female prisoner is currently unaccounted for.
Secure all exits.
Repeat, secure all exits.
Target is armed and dangerous, use extreme caution.
I don't think she's acting as the Goa'uld.
Daniel!
I just need a drink of water.
Please, I'm...
I'm not feeling 100%.
My pills...
I think it's a deactivation code.
Agent Barrett, this is Major Carter, come in.
What's your location.
Agent Barrett?
This is Major Carter, Agent Barrett needs medical attention.
We are in the north-east corridor, level one.
That's it.. it's off.
I mean the lights turned off, that means it's off right?
Indeed.
Well hey!
Drop the gun.
Anna..
Drop it.
Come with me now,
I will help you.
You can't help me.
Whatever they've told you..
It doesn't matter, I never believed you.
Anna, I did it to help people.
All the evil I have seen in my mind, nothing you put inside of me, compares to what I see in you.
Anna!
What did you do?
You couldn't help me.
I'm so sorry.
(helicopter overhead)
Major Carter, Dr Jackson, Teal'c.
Glad you could make it.
Agent Barrett.
- How's Colonel O'Neill?
- Still recovering.
Taking some time off.
We're still putting the details together.
Follow me.
I'll explain.
- What is this place?
- An abandoned industrial complex.
It was home to a rogue NID sleeper cell we've been trying to locate for over a year.
- Still haven't got them all?
- Not by a long shot.
Their ties run deep.
They seem to have infinite resources.
- What were they doing here?
- We're not exactly sure yet.
What happened?
At approximately 0800 hours this morning, we intercepted a 911 call.
We moved in just after local authorities arrived and have been in lockdown mode.
Somebody from a top-secret, not to mention illegal, NID operation called 911?
It got real ugly.
Come on.
We got a call from a panicked male voice.
We think it was from the cleaning staff.
The call was cut short.
We've counted 32 casualties, which includes a six-man security contingent.
- Who would do this?
- And for what reason?
We know who did it.
As for why...
- You know who did this?
- Yeah.
Open it.
It was her.
At first we thought she was a survivor, and then we found this.
We found her in a corner.
She seemed terrified, no memory of what happened.
- You put her in the cell?
- She said that's where they kept her.
We locked her up after we found the security tapes.
- Who is she?
- We're not sure yet.
She's been printed.
- I'm running her through the system.
- Other survivors?
A scientist, Keffler.
We're holding him upstairs.
He hasn't been very talkative.
Come on, let me show you why I called you guys down here.
Wow.
Recognise anything?
Nothing I've catalogued as coming through the SGC.
- This indicates it belonged to Sekhmet.
- Who was that?
A Goa'uld who at one time was loyal to Ra.
She was a powerful ally of his.
He would dispatch her to rule planets in his stead.
Quell rebellions, oversee executions.
All the fun stuff.
What happened to her?
She was exiled for plotting against Ra.
We also believe she lived here for most of his dynasty.
I didn't realise this had been recovered.
- It may have come from the Germans.
- The Germans?
The background on Keffler says that he's the son of a Nazi war criminal.
- We shouldn't be that surprised.
- Rogue NID have no limits, do they?
See if there's anything else you can tell me about this stuff.
I'm going to go back at Keffler again.
Want to join me?
Sure.
Thought you might want to watch a master of interrogation at work.
You call in someone special?
Dr Keffler.
This is Major Samantha Carter.
Of the Stargate programme.
That's right.
Are you ready to tell us about the girl?
Doctor, do I really need to explain the nature of your situation?
Please do.
It amuses me.
This was an off-the-books NID operation, which means you technically don't exist, which means no phone calls, no lawyers.
I don't even have to read you your rights.
To make matters worse for you, the people behind this operation are all in jail.
Nobody to bail you out.
What kind of work was being done here, Doctor?
You're a smart girl.
You'll figure it out.
Do you think we'll let you walk away from this?
- 32 people are dead.
- Believe it or not, I do feel bad about that.
Some of them were not quite as incompetent as the others.
Unfortunately the bad ones always ruin it for everyone, don't they?
- What's this?
- That unlocks my car.
Don't think you're safe.
Read the papers, Agent Barrett.
No-one is safe these days.
My pills.
Now, now.
You wouldn't want your only witness to die on you, would you?
It's nitro.
Says he has a bad heart.
I'd say an X-ray would confirm a total absence.
- I think he's starting to crack.
- He was colder than Hannibal Lecter.
Still, obviously no match for a master interrogator.
- You didn't get all Clarice Starling on him.
- I didn't want to step on your toes.
- One more thing to show you.
- There's more?
Trust me, I'm saving the best for last.
- This isn't at all creepy.
- It gets better.
They look like partially developed foetuses.
They don't look human to me.
- Failed experiments of some kind?
- "What kind?" is the question.
Well, there's one way to find out.
No.
Forget it.
We've already tried that.
All the codes are encrypted.
- I've requested a data retrieval team.
- Present and accounted for.
Right.
Of course.
- So, how have you been?
- Busy.
You?
Busy.
You know, I never properly thanked you for that memo on Woolsey.
Maybe we could go out for dinner sometime.
- I'm seeing someone right now.
- Really?
You?
- Hm.
- Well, you asked me out.
Yeah.
Right.
Sorry.
I'm going to go check in with Dr Jackson and Teal'c.
Most of the artefacts are related in some way to Sekhmet.
I'm guessing they were found on Earth, possibly in an Egyptian tomb or crypt.
- Nothing of note?
- No, it's interesting stuff, but not really.
- What's this?
- It would appear to be an ark.
Ordained in the gold motif of Ra, the sun god.
Possibly a gift to Sekhmet.
- What's in it?
- We haven't been able to open it.
But these turn.
- Some sort of combination lock?
- So it would seem.
- Any luck with the scientist?
- No, not exactly.
The girl may be on tape killing everybody, but I'm sure that guy is not innocent.
What about that girl?
She hasn't said anything since we locked her up.
I was kind of hoping that you'd give it a try.
Me?
Heard you got a knack for this type of thing.
Hi, I'm Daniel Jackson.
You're Anna, right?
You know, when I first saw you,
I didn't believe that you could do the things they said you did.
And even after I saw it for myself, I still don't believe it.
Look, I know you don't know me and you have no reason to trust me, but...
I want to help you.
Before I do that, I need to know a few things first.
I need to know who you are.
What's happened to you.
Why you're here in a cell like this.
Do you even understand me?
- I didn't kill those people.
- There's some overwhelming evidence.
It wasn't me.
Please, you have to believe me.
It wasn't me.
Turn it off.
Turn it off!
Sorry.
I couldn't do those things.
- It looks like you did.
- It's not me.
- Then who is it?
- I don't know.
OK, where were you when this was happening?
If the person on the tape isn't you, where were you?
I don't remember.
Who is Dr Keffler?
He is the one who made me.
- She says Keffler made her.
- What does that mean?
- Some sort of genetic research?
- No, she's over 20 years old.
The Asgard can rapidly grow a human clone, but...
Area 51 has a sample of Goa'uld nanite technology from the planet Argos.
It can rapidly grow a human with the ability to learn very quickly, and the rogue NID would have had access to that.
She says Keffler is responsible for everything that happened.
- How?
- I don't know.
- Do you think she's telling the truth?
- I don't know what to think.
She believes she didn't do it.
Says the girl on the tape isn't her.
How can that be possible?
The NID have cloned a Goa'uld symbiote before.
- She could be a clone.
- There could be more than one of her.
- How well did you search the facility?
- Top to bottom.
I better put an APB out to local authorities.
Anna, how long have you lived here?
Since I remember.
Yeah?
How long is that, exactly?
I don't know.
Have you ever had a birthday?
You know, a birthday.
A cake with candles on it, funny hats, pin the tail on the donkey, that kind of thing.
He gave me this paper and some new charcoal.
Who, Dr Keffler?
He always gave me paper, but once he said it was my birthday.
Just once?
Have you ever seen anything outside of this room?
Just pictures.
I've read a lot of books which describe the world outside.
The mountains, oceans.
The sun.
But you've never experienced them first-hand?
What about these?
Those are the things I see in my dreams.
Flashes.
- They just come to me.
- Do they mean anything to you?
Just that they scare me.
If they scare you so much, why do you hang them up everywhere?
I don't want them there.
He hurts me if I take them down.
They are important to him.
Do you have any more with one of those on it?
Maybe on an ark?
I got it.
It's one of Anna's sketches.
I think it's a combination to open the ark.
- Did we just do that?
- I do not believe so.
It was activated some time ago.
I got a picture out to local authorities.
If there's a girl that looks like her, we'll find her.
- I'm in.
I have complete access.
- Nice work.
The files seem to document recent work going back over three years.
Recent work?
The artefacts go back to Napoleon.
The Nazis eventually recovered them.
They ended up in Keffler's father's hands.
They found a Canopic jar.
It's a vessel containing a preserved symbiote.
Keffler spliced human ovum with DNA taken from a Goa'uld.
- She is a human-Goa'uld hybrid.
- Goa'uld pass on knowledge genetically.
They tried to create a human who could tell them all a Goa'uld would know.
- They didn't want to wait.
- Nanite technology from Area 51.
So they could make her grow up quickly.
It took them 45 failures before they finally got it right.
- You can call off that APB.
- There's only one of her.
According to this.
The previous attempts either didn't blend properly or they grew too fast and died.
The technology had to be modified so the human could slowly learn to gain access to the genetic knowledge buried in her DNA.
My God.
They tortured the poor girl.
Sensory deprivation, electrocution.
- Major Carter.
Agent Barrett.
- She's not a clone.
There's only one of her and she's got Goa'uld DNA blended with her own.
That could explain her behaviour.
- The ark is a bomb.
- What?
- The ark is a Goa'uld explosive device.
- And it's been activated.
- How much time do we have?
- Approximately 16 hours.
How interesting.
Wipe that smarmy smile off your face and tell me what's going on here!
- You're hurting me.
- Nothing could make up for what you did.
- Agent Barrett.
- Listen to her, Agent Barrett.
You are gonna tell me everything I want to know or I'm gonna beat you senseless.
What do you want to know?
For starters, do you know how to deactivate the bomb?
I didn't know it was a bomb.
So this girl breaks out of her cell, kills 32 people, sets a bomb and then sticks around?
- How does that make sense?
- Your problem, Agent Barrett, one among many, I must point out, is that you see her as a girl.
If you're gonna give us moral justification...
Please, Major.
I know you have helped to orchestrate the death of Goa'ulds before.
Assassinated them in cold blood without regard for the life of the human host.
- I didn't create the problem.
- Neither did I.
I am merely trying to help solve it.
The Goa'uld are a terrible threat to us all.
Anna is a conduit to the knowledge that could level the playing field.
And I think we all agree that if killing one person could save millions, billions of innocent lives, you would have no choice.
You would do it.
- Answer my question.
- I'm sorry, I've forgotten what it was.
Why set the bomb and stick around?
Anna did not set that bomb.
- Then who did?
- The Goa'uld.
Sekhmet.
But wait a minute.
She doesn't have a snake inside of her, right?
It's something we didn't expect.
A separate and distinct personality.
Anna's mind has created a personality that acts like the Goa'uld Sekhmet?
Yes, but I don't know if she is incapable of dealing with the darkness within her, or if that knowledge is so powerful that it is capable of manifesting itself as such.
I only know that it emerges and speaks as a unique entity.
We have witnessed it with a growing frequency.
Anna has no awareness.
To her, it is as if she has blacked out.
The Goa'uld personality comes out, goes on a rampage, sets the bomb...
But can't stay in control of the body long enough.
Her breakthroughs are sporadic and seem somewhat uncontrolled.
- Still, why set the bomb?
- Leverage.
Against what?
Sekhmet has conscious control of the body for short periods.
She wants more.
She was gonna blackmail you with the bomb.
The psyche is so simple, isn't it?
So single-minded.
It's truly fascinating to behold.
She thinks you can give her that full control.
Can you?
She is the experiment.
I am the observer.
The Goa'uld personality didn't go do something like this on a whim.
You led her to believe that you have the power to give her control of her life, and I'll bet you did it so she would tell you what you want to know.
How to save us all, Major.
I'm not the only one who wants to know.
I don't remember anything.
I know this must be hard for you.
How can you know what this is like for me?
Cos I knew a boy once and he was like you.
- There are more like me?
- Not exactly.
He was born of two Goa'uld hosts.
They call a child like that a Harsesis.
- What happened to him?
- He was saved by a very powerful being.
He ascended to a higher plane of existence and, when he did, he gained great power himself.
He used it to show me that the knowledge and memories passed on to him by the Goa'uld genetically came with a terrible burden, and how it was wrong to seek it for any reason.
Can I be saved like him?
Maybe.
Honestly, I don't know.
Will you help us shut this bomb off?
- I don't know how.
- You do.
You knew how to open the ark.
It was in your drawings.
I don't remember turning it on.
I know, but somewhere inside your mind is the answer, and I can help you find it.
(beeping)
According to these readings, there's a ten-pound block of naqahdah in this thing.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It would be very bad if it went off.
It's a bomb.
Usually it's not a good thing when they go off.
Can we move this?
From what I know of Goa'uld weaponry, that would be unwise.
It may have a sensor.
Yeah, I don't even want to go there.
Let's...
Let's see if we can disarm it here.
I'll get the local authorities to evacuate the area.
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- How many miles are we talking about?
I don't know.
How big is Orange County?
You're kidding, right?
Do I look like a practical joker to you?
Images just come to me.
I draw them.
I don't know what they mean.
Just relax and think about it.
When you look at this, what comes to mind?
The blackouts.
They're happening more and more.
Do you trust me?
Do you trust me?
I want to help you.
I don't want to hurt you.
After I help you?
It's not like that.
We have to shut this bomb off.
- How many birthdays have you had?
- That's not important right now.
You sound just like him.
I heard you were in here.
What are you doing?
I noticed most of the tapes were labelled "Anna".
It's not just security footage.
It's documentation of the research.
- Anything useful?
- No.
Just something she said when we were talking, that I reminded her of Keffler.
Figured I needed to learn about how he dealt with her.
What are the chances you'll find out how to deactivate the bomb from her in time?
I don't know.
We're trying to evacuate the area.
We don't know how big the blast will be.
No pressure.
I'll leave now.
I'd feel better if you were down there working on the bomb.
Dr Lee is the best we've got and Teal'c knows more about Goa'uld weapons.
I wanted to see if there was anything more in the research notes that might help.
Like what?
If we can offer Anna a cure for her condition, she might be willing to help us.
She's been horribly mistreated and without intervention she'd have little hope of survival.
At the time they made her, they had no idea what her life span was gonna be.
Based on her current rate of growth, I estimate it can't be more than three years.
- Can you help her?
- Possibly.
We should be able to halt the rapid-growth effects of the nanites.
I doubt we can unmarry the Goa'uld DNA from hers, but we may be able to block the knowledge from her conscious mind.
Stop it from possessing her.
We've had some luck with certain drugs in similar situations.
I suppose the fact that you've had similar situations shouldn't come as a shock.
- Anything on your end?
- Keffler.
He wants to chat.
(Anna screams)
There is a cure, Anna.
You can be a normal girl, live a normal life.
You can be free, or you can continue to suffer.
(screams)
I don't know anything.
Please stop.
- (Sekhmet) Stop this at once.
- Now we're getting somewhere.
- Let me out of here.
- In due time, freedom can be yours.
Do you think I will just tell you the secrets of the Goa'uld?
- If you want to live.
- You will not kill me.
I can make another as easily as I made you.
If it were up to me, given the chance
I would rip the beating heart from your chest and feed it to you.
Such colourful language.
Let's focus on the issue at hand, shall we?
Son of a bitch.
We have the same goal.
I do not wish to see my work go to waste.
Look...
I know her.
I know how her mind works.
I can get you what you need.
Yeah, I've read about your methods.
I will only talk to her.
You are welcome to be present the entire time.
What do you want?
I can't believe you'd be doing this solely for the greater good.
My freedom.
Not a chance.
I am guilty of nothing more than trying to save this world.
Just like you.
We are at war.
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
I've heard that defence.
What choice do you have?
How many people will die if that bomb goes off?
Let's consider this.
Do you have the authority to offer him immunity?
Trust me, no matter what we decide to do, no court is ever gonna hear about this.
Daniel?
- You let her out, didn't you?
- You must be Daniel Jackson.
What's going on?
He can control when the Goa'uld comes out.
It's not just random.
- He's got himself a little remote control.
- This?
Yeah.
He uses it to shock her.
He can make the Goa'uld personality appear, or kill her with it.
Why?
Other scientists gonna shut down your research, report your experiment?
You have no proof.
You brought out the Goa'uld personality, then let her out.
You murdered 32 people.
Speculation.
You can control her with that.
If you didn't want the scientists dead, why didn't you stop her?
Careful.
OK.
Just because the cover wasn't booby-trapped doesn't mean the crystals themselves are safe to touch.
That is correct.
There's no energy signatures.
I don't think there's any force fields or sensors protecting the compartment.
I am unsure which of these crystals would control detonation.
- Blue is typically for power regulation.
- Indeed.
If we remove the power regulation for the control board...
The device could explode.
Yeah.
I suppose.
It's not like I was gonna pull the yellow one.
Obviously letting Keffler anywhere near the girl is out.
And if we're gonna get the bomb deactivation code from Anna, you're gonna have to do it.
Right.
This red crystal seems to control the timer.
Now, I should be able to interface with it and hopefully reprogram it.
- (whirring)
- Anything happening?
- The countdown is increasing in speed.
- What?
Did that stop it?
- Yes.
However...
- Hey, how's it coming?
Not well, I take it?
- No, we just had a little setback.
- What?
I was trying to interface with a control crystal...
The time until detonation is now less than two hours.
OK.
Let's hope that Dr Jackson is having better luck.
They're trying to evacuate people, but if that bomb goes off, people are still gonna die.
Including us?
We have a helicopter standing by to get us to a safe distance if it comes to that.
I'm hoping it doesn't, because a lot of others won't have that luxury.
I've been trying.
I can't see anything.
You know, not so long ago, I had my memories erased.
How?
It's a long story, but I was able to access certain lost memories by meditating.
A friend of mine showed me how to do it.
I think that can help you.
What I see scares me so much.
I know.
And for good reason.
Ultimately it's up to you.
I can't force you to do this and I won't.
And I promise, either way we're gonna try and help you, make it so you can live a normal life.
He always said he could do that.
The truth is, I'm not sure if we can, but we're going to try anything and everything in our power.
OK, good. 42 minutes 15 seconds and counting.
I'll check back.
Thanks.
We've got ten blocks in each direction evacuated.
- That's nowhere near enough.
- I know.
I finished going through the files on the computer.
Even if we halt the nanites' rapid-growth effect, you didn't isolate the gene with the Goa'uld genetic knowledge.
We didn't have time to sequence the entire strand.
The goal was to get the intelligence, not to create a viable living organism.
- I don't understand.
- The way he blended the DNA.
There's nothing we can do to stop the Goa'uld DNA taking over.
It will overwrite the human and nothing I know of will stop it.
- What's going to happen to her?
- She'll die.
A horrible, painful death.
There's no cure, no way to save her.
That was just another lie.
I placed a capsule of biotoxin at the base of her brain.
The remote device will activate it.
I did this to prevent any undue suffering when the time came.
How humane of you.
- What do I do?
- Just relax and try thinking of nothing.
Nothing?
Try an empty room.
You see a doorway.
Go to that door and open it.
Go through.
You're inside of a stone room.
The floor is made of polished marble.
You're inside of a great pyramid.
Ornate carvings of giant snakes flank a beautiful golden throne.
You see a window and you walk towards it.
Outside there are thousands of people.
Slaves who worship you as a god.
You have great power over them.
The power to decide who lives and who dies.
No!
- I will tell you nothing.
- Anna!
Anna, stop!
No!
Fire!
Fire!
Hurry!
Come on!
Hurry!
Daniel.
You OK?
- Where is she?
- She won't get far.
This is Agent Barrett.
The female prisoner is unaccounted for.
Secure all exits.
Secure entire perimeter and begin a full sweep.
Target is armed and dangerous.
Use extreme caution.
Ugh!
I don't think she's acting as the Goa'uld.
Daniel!
I just, uh... need a drink of water.
Please, I'm...
I'm not feeling one hundred per cent.
Agh...
My pills.
Ugh!
I think it's the deactivation code.
Agent Barrett, this is Major Carter.
Come in.
What's your location?
Agent Barrett?
This is Carter.
Agent Barrett needs medical attention.
We are in the northeast corridor, level one.
That's it.
It's off.
I mean, the lights turned off.
That means it's off, right?
Indeed.
Well, hey...
Drop the gun.
- Anna...
- Drop it!
Come with me... now... to the lab.
- I will help you.
- You can't help me.
- Whatever they've told you...
- It doesn't matter.
I never believed you.
Anna, I did it to help people.
All the evil I have seen in my mind, nothing you put inside me compares to what I see in you.
(running footsteps)
(machine-gun fire)
Anna!
What did you do?
You couldn't help me.
I'm so sorry.
Major Carter, Doctor Jackson, Teal'c.
I'm glad you could make it.
Agent Barrett?
How's Colonel O'Neill doing?
Still recovering.
He's taking some time off.
Well we're still putting the details together here.
If you follow me, I'll explain as we go.
What is this place?
An abandoned industrial complex.
Near as we can tell it was home to a rogue NID sleeper cell we've been trying to locate for over a year now.
- Still haven't got them all?
No.
Not by a long shot Major.
Their ties run deep.
They seem to have infinite resources at their disposal.
What were they doing here?
We're not exactly sure yet.
What happened?
At approximately 08.00 hours this morning we intercepted a 911 call.
We moved in just after local authorities arrived.
We've been in lockdown mode ever since.
Wait a minute.
Someone's running a top secret not to mention illegal NID operation called 911?
- It got real ugly.
Come on.
We got a call from a panicked male voice.
We think it was from a member of the cleaning staff.
The call was cut short.
Thus far we've counted 32 casualties which include the six man security contingent.
- Who would do this?
- And for what reason?
Actually we know who did it.
As for why.
- You know who did this?
- Yeah.
Open it.
It was her.
Season 7 Episode 19 Resurrection
Transcript by stargatedanielfriendly.net
Synchro by Djnono, Nicotr Toutancarton
At first we thought she was a survivor until we founded this.
We found her cowering in the corner.
She seemed to be genuinely terrified and no memory of what happened.
You put her in the cell?
Yes, she said that's where they kept her.
We locked her up after we found the security tapes.
We didn't wanna take any chances.
Who is she?
We're not sure yet.
She's been printed We're running her through the system.
Any other survivors?
Got one.
A scientist named Keffler.
We're holding him upstairs.
So far he hasn't been very talkative.
Come on, let me show you why I called you guys down here.
Wow.
Recognise anything?
Nothing I've catalogued as coming through the SGC.
This indicates it belonged to Sekhmet.
Who was that?
A Goa'uld who at one time was loyal to Ra.
From what we know she was a powerful ally of his.
He would routinely despatch her to rule planets in his stead.
Halt rebellions, mass executions.
You know, all the fun stuff.
Sounds like a real sweetheart.
What happened to her?
It is believed she was exiled for plotting against Ra.
It's also believed she lived here for most of his dynasty.
I didn't realise that this stuff had been recovered.
From what I can gather, it may have come from the Germans.
The Germans?
The background that I have on Keffler suggests that he's the son of a convicted Nazi war criminal.
I guess we really shouldn't be that surprised.
Rogue NID really have no limits do they.
See if there's anything else you can tell me about this stuff.
I'm gonna go back at Keffler again Do you wanna join me?
Sure
Just thought you might wanna watch a master of interrogation at work.
Huh!
You calling in someone special?
Doctor Keffler.
This is Major Samantha Carter.
Of the Stargate program.
That's right.
Are you ready to tell us about the girl?
Look Doctor.
Do I really need to explain the nature of your situation?
Oh please do.
It amuses me.
This was an off the books NID operation.
Which means you technically don't exist.
Which means no phone calls, no lawyers.
Hell, I don't even have to read you your rights.
To make matters worse for you, the people behind the operation are all in jail.
Nobody to bail you out.
What kind of work was being done here Doctor?
You're a smart girl.
You'll figure it out.
Look, do you really think that we are gonna let you walk away from this?
32 people are dead.
Believe it or not, I do feel bad about that.
Some of them were not quite as incompetent as the others.
Unfortunately the bad one's always ruin it for everyone, don't they?
What's this?
That unlocks my car.
Don't think you're safe.
Read the papers Agent Barrett.
No-one is safe these days.
My pills.
Now, now.
Wouldn't want your only witness to die on you, would you.
It's nitro.
Say's he has a bad heart.
I'd say an x-ray would confirm a total absence.
I don't know I think he's starting to crack.
The guy was quoting Hannibal Lector in there.
Still, he's no match for a master interogator.
I didn't see you on his ass.
I didn't wanna step on your toes.
Right.
Come on.
- I've got one more thing to show you.
- There's more?
Trust me, I'm saving the best for last.
This isn't at all creepy.
Oh, it get's better.
They look like partially developed foetus'
They don't look human to me.
Failed experiments of some kind?
What kind is the question.
Well, there's one way to find out.
No, forget it.
Major we've already tried that.
All the codes are encrypted.
I've requested a data retrieval team.
Present and accounted for.
Right, of course.
So how've you been?
Busy, you?
Busy.
You know I never properly thanked you for that memo on Woolsey.
Well, maybe we could go out for dinner sometime.
It's just that I'm seeing someone right now.
Really?
You?
You asked me out.
Yeah, yeah.
Sorry.
I'm gonna go check in on Doctor Jackson and Teal'c.
Most of the artefacts are related in some way to Sekhmet.
I'm guessing they were found here on Earth, possibly in an Egyptian tomb or crypt of some kind.
Nothing of note?
No, I mean it's interesting stuff.
But ah...no, not really.
What's this?
It would appear to be an ark.
Regaling the gold motiff of Ra, Sun God.
Possibly a gift to Sekhmet.
Ok, what's in it?
I don't know we haven't been able to open it.
But umm these turn.
Some sort of combination lock?
So it would seem.
Any luck with the scientist?
No not exactly.
You know the girl, she maybe on tape killing everybody?
But I'm pretty sure that guy up there's not innocent.
Yeah, what about that girl.
She hasn't said anything since we locked her up.
I was kinda hoping that you'd give it a try.
Me?
Heard you got a knack for this type of thing.
Hi, I'm Daniel Jackson.
You're Anna right?
You know when I first saw you,..
.. I didn't believe that you could do the things they said you did.
And even after I saw it for myself, I still don't believe it.
Look, I know you don't know me and you have no reason to trust me but,..
.. I wanna help you.
Before I do that, I need to know a few things first.
I need to know who you are.
What's happened to you.
Why you're here in a cell like this.
Do you even understand me?
I didn't kill those people.
Well there's some pretty overwhelming evidence.
It wasn't me.
Please, you have to believe me.
It wasn't me.
Turn it off.
Turn it off!
Sorry.
I couldn't do those things.
Looks like you did.
It's not me.
Then who is it?
I don't know.
Ok, where were you when this was happening?
If the person on the tape isn't you, where were you?
- What were you doing?
- I don't remember!
Who's Doctor Keffler?
He's the one who made me.
- She say's that Keffler made her.
- What the hell does that mean?
Some sort of genetic research.
No, she's over twenty years old.
The operation hasn't been going on that long.
We know the Asgard can rapidly grow a human clone, but...
Area 51 has a sample of Goa'uld nannite technology from the planet Argos.
It can also rapidly grow a human with the ability to learn very quickly, and the rogue NID would have had access to that.
She also say's that Keffler is responsible for everything that happened.
How?
I don't know.
Do you think she's telling the truth?
To be honest, I don't know what to think.
She certainly believes she didn't do it, says the girl in the videotape isn't her.
Would that be possible?
The NID have cloned a Goa'uld symbiote before.
Right, of course, she could be a clone.
So there could be more than one of her.
How well have you searched this faciltity?
From top to bottom.
I'd better put an APB out to local authorities.
Anna, how long have you lived here?
Since I remember.
Yeah?
How long is that exactly?
I don't know.
You ever have a birthday?
You know a birthday.
A cake with candles on it, funny hats, pin the tail of the donkey, that kind of thing.
He gave me this paper and some new charcoal.
Who, Doctor Keffler?
He always gave me paper, but once, once he said it was my birthday.
Just once.
Have you ever seen anything outside of this room?
Just pictures.
I've read a lot of books which described the world outside.
The mountains, oceans, the sun.
But you've never experienced them firsthand?
What about these?
Those are the things I see in my dreams.
Flashes, they just come to me.
Do they mean anything to you?
Just that they scare me.
If they scare you so much, why do you hang them up everywhere?
I don't want them there.
He hurts me if I take them down.
They're important to him.
Do you have anymore with one of those on it?
Maybe on an arc?
I got it.
It's one of Anna's sketches.
I think it's a combination to open the arc.
Did we just do that?
I do not believe so.
It was activated some time ago.
I've got a picture out to local authorities.
If there's a second girl out there that looks like her, we'll find her.
I'm in, I have complete access.
Nice work.
The files seem to document recent work going back over three years.
Recent work?
The artifacts go all the way back to Napoleon.
The Nazi's eventually recovered them.
They ended up in Keffler's father's hands.
They found a canopic jar.
It's a vessel containing a preserved symbiote.
Keffler spliced human ovum with DNA taken from a Goa'uld.
The girls a human/Goa'uld hybrid.
The Goa'uld pass on their knowledge genetically.
They were trying to create a human who could tell them everything the Goa'uld would know.
They didn't wanna wait either.
They got their nannite technology from area 51.
So they could make it grow up quickly.
It took them 45 failures before they finally got it right.
You can call off that APB.
There's only one of her.
According to this the previous attempts either didn't blend properly or they grew too fast and died.
The technology had to be modified so that the human could slowly learn to gain access to the genetic knowledge buried in the DNA.
My God, they tortured the poor girl.
Sensory deprivation, electrocution.
Major Carter, Agent Barrett.
She's not a clone.
There's only one of her and she's got Goa'uld DNA blended with her own.
That could explain her behaviour and why she doesn't know what she's doing.
The arc is a bomb.
What?
The arc is in fact a Goa'uld explosive device.
And it's been activated.
How much time do we have?
Approximately sixteen hours.
How interesting.
Wipe the smarmy smile off your face and tell me what's going on here!
You're hurting me.
Nothing I do to you could make up for what you've done here.
Agent Barrett!
Listen to her, Agent Barrett.
You are gonna tell me everything that I wanna know or she's not gonna be able to stop me from beating you senseless.
What do you want to know?
For starters, do you know how to de-activate the bomb?
I didn't know it was a bomb.
So, this girl breaks out of her cell.
Kills 32 people, sets a bomb to go off a day from now and then sticks around.
How does that make sense?
Your problem, Agent Barrett.
One among many I must point out is that you see her as a girl.
Look, if you're gonna try and give us some moral justification
- for what's gone on here.
- Please Major.
I know that you have helped orchestrate the death of Goa'ulds before.
Assassinated them in cold blood in fact, without regard for the life of the human host.
I didn't create the problem!
Neither did I!
I am merely trying to help solve it.
The Goa'uld are a terrible threat to us all.
Anna is a device, a conduit, to the knowledge that could level the playing field and I think we all agree that if killing one person could save millions, billions of innocent lives.
You would have no choice.
You would do it.
Answer my question.
- I'm sorry, I've forgotten what it was.
- Why set the bomb and stick around?
Anna did not set that bomb.
Then who did?
The Goa'uld.
Sekhmet.
Now wait a minute.
She doesn't have a symbiote inside of her right?
Something we didn't expect.
separate and distinct personalities.
Are you saying that Anna's mind has created an entirely separate personality that acts like the Goa'uld Sekhmet?
Yes.
But I don't know..
.. if it's that she is capable of dealing with the darkness within her, or that,..
.. that knowledge is so powerful that it's capable of manifesting itself as such.
I only know that it emerges, speaks as a unique entity.
We have witnessed it with a growing frequency.
Anna has no awareness.
To her it is as if she's blacked out.
Ok, so the Goa'uld personality comes out, goes on a rampage, sets the bomb.
And can't stay in control of the body long enough to finish what she began.
Her breakthrough's are sporadic.
Even somewhat uncontrolled.
Still, why set the bomb?
Leverage.
Against what?
Sekhmet only has conscious control of the body for short periods at a time.
She wants more.
She was gonna blackmail you witht he bomb.
Ah the psyche is so simple isn't it, so single minded.
Truly fascinating to behold.
She thinks you can give her that full control.
Can you?
She's the experiment, I'm the observer.
Still, the Goa'uld personality didn't go do something like this on a whim.
You led her to believe that you have the power to give her control of her life.
And I'll bet you did it so she would tell you what you want to know.
How to save us all Major.
I'm not the only one who wants to know.
I don't remember anything.
I know this must be hard for you.
How can you know what this is like for me?
Cos I knew a boy once who was like you.
There are more like me?
Not exactly.
He was born of two Goa'uld hosts.
They call a child like that a Harcesis.
What happened to him?
He was saved by a very powerful being.
He ascended to a higher plane of existence, and when he did he gained great power himself.
He used that power to show me that all the knowledge and memories passed onto him by the Goa'uld genetically,..
.. came with a terrible burden.
And how it was wrong to seek it for any reason.
Can I be saved like him?
Maybe.
Honestly I don't know.
Will you help us shut this bomb off?
I don't know how.
You do.
You knew how to open the arc, it was in your drawings.
I don't remember turning it on.
I know, but somewhere inside your mind is the answer and I can help you find it.
According to these readings there's a ten pound block of Naquadah in this thing.
What's that supposed to mean?
It would be very bad if it went off.
Well it's a bomb right?
I mean usually it's not a good thing when they go off.
True.
Can we move this?
From what I know of Goa'uld weaponry, it would be unwise.
It may have a sensor that would detect such an action.
Yeah.
I don't even want to go there.
Let's...
Let's see if we can disarm it here first.
I'm going to get the local authorities to start evacuating the area.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
How many miles are we talking about here?
I don't know.
How big is orange county?
You're kidding right?
Do I look like a practical joker to you?
Images just come to me.
I draw them.
I don't know what they mean.
Just relax and think about it.
When you look at this, what comes to mind?
The blackouts.
They're happening more and more.
Do you trust me?
Do you trust me?
I want to help you, I don't want to hurt you.
After I help you?
It's not like that.
We have to shut this bomb off.
How many birthdays have you had?
That's not important right now.
You sound just like him.
I heard you were here.
What are you doing?
I notice most of the tapes were labeled, Anna.
It's not just security video footage, it's actually documentation of the research.
Anything useful?
No, just something she said when we were talking.
I reminded her of Keffler.
I need to learn more about how he dealt with her before I pressed her too much.
What are the chances you'll find out how to desactivate the bomb from her.
I don't know.
We're trying to get as much of the area evacuated as we can, we just don't know how big the blast is going to be.
No pressure.
I'll leave now.
You know I'd feel better if you were down there working on the bomb.
Doctor Lee is the best we've got for this and
Teal'c knows more than I do about Goa'uld weapons.
Besides I wanted to see if there was anything more in the research notes that might help.
Like what?
Well, if we can offer Anna a cure for her condition, she might be more willing to help us.
She's been horribly mistreated and without intervention she'd have very little hope of survival.
Now, at the time they made her, they had no idea what her lifespan was going to be.
Based on her current rate of growth, I estimate it won't be more than three years.
Can you help her?
Possibly.
We should at least be able to halt the rapid growth effects of the nannites.
Now I doubt we can unmarry the Goa'uld DNA from hers, but we may be able to block the knowledge from her conscious mind and stop it from possessing her.
We've has some luck with certain drugs in similar situations before.
I suppose the fact that you've has similar situations to this shouldn't come as a total shock?
Anything on your end?
Keffler, he wants to chat.
There is a cure Anna.
You can be a normal girl, with a normal life.
You can be free, or you can continue to suffer.
I don't know anything.
Please stop.
Stop this at once I command you.
Now we're getting somewhere.
Let me out of here.
In due time, freedom can be yours.
You think I will just tell you the secrets of the Goa'uld.
If you want to live.
You will not kill me.
I can make another as easily as I made you.
If it were up to me, given the chance, I would rip the beating heart from your chest and feed it to you.
Such colorful language.
Let's focus on the issue at hand shall we?
Son of a bitch.
We have the same goal.
I do not wish to see my work go to waste.
Look, I know her.
I know how her mind works.
I can get you what you need.
Yeah, I've read about your methods.
I will only talk to her.
You are welcome to be present the entire time.
And what do you want in return?
I can't believe that you'd be doing this solely for the greater good.
My freedom.
Not a chance.
I am guilty of nothing more than trying to save this world, just like you.
We are at war.
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
I've heard that defense.
What choice do you have?
How many people will die if that bomb goes off?
Let's just say we're considering this.
Do you have the authority to offer him immunity?
Trust me, no matter what we decide to do.
No court is ever going to hear about this.
Daniel?
You let her out, didn't you!
You must be Daniel Jackson.
Daniel, what's going on?
He can control when the Goa'uld comes out.
It's not just random.
He's got himself a little remote control.
This?
Yeah, he uses it to shock her.
He can either make the Goa'uld personality appear or he can kill her with it.
Why?
Other scientists going to shut down your research, maybe report your little science experiment?
You have no proof of that.
You used that device to bring out the Goa'uld personality, then you let her out of her cage.
You murdered 32 people.
Speculation.
You can control her with that.
If you didn't want the other scientist dead, why didn't you stop her?
Careful.
Okay.
Just because the cover wasn't booby trapped, it doesn't mean that the crystals themselves are safe to touch.
That is correct.
There's no energy signatures, I don't think there's any force fields or sensors protecting the compartment.
I am unsure.
Which of these crystals would control the detonation of this device?
Well blue is typically for power regulation.
Indeed.
So if we remove the power regulation from the entire control board..
The device could explode.
Yeah, yeah..
I suppose.
I mean it's not like I was going to pull the yellow one.
So obviously letting Keffler anywhere near the girl is out.
And if we're going to get the bomb deactivation code from Anna, you're going to have to do it.
Right.
Okay, so this red crystal seems to control the timer.
Now I should be able to interface with it and hopefully reprogram it.
Anything happening?
The countdown seems to be increasing in speed.
What!
?
Did that stop it?
Yes.
How is it going?
Not well I take it.
Well no, we just had a little setback.
What?
Well, I was trying to interface with one of the control crystals.
The time until detonation is now less then two hours.
Okay, well let's hope that Doctor Jackson is having better luck.
We're trying to evacuate as many people as possible but if that bombs goes off, people are still going to die.
Including us?
We have a helicopter standing by to get us to a safe distance if it comes to that.
I'm hoping it doesn't because a lot of other won't have that luxury.
I've been trying, I can't see anything.
You know not so long ago, I had my memories erased.
How?
It's a long story but the point is... that I was able to access certain lost memories by meditating.
A friend of mine showed me how to do it.
Now I think that can help you.
What I see, scares me so much.
I know, and for a good reason.
Ultimately it's up to you, I can't force you to do this and I won't.
I promise either way that we're going to try to help you.
Make it so that you can live a normal life.
He always said that he could do that.
Well the truth is that I'm not sure if we can, but we're going to try anything and everything in our power.
Okay good. 42 minutes, 15 seconds and counting.
Right, I'll check back, thanks.
We've got ten city blocks in each direction fully evacuated.
That's nowhere near enough.
I know.
I just finished going through the files in the computer.
Even if we halt the rapid growth effect of the nannites, you didn't isolate the gene that carries the Goa'uld genetic knowledge.
We didn't have time to sequence the entire stand.
The goal was to get the intelligence Major, not to create a viable living organism.
I don't understand.
The way you blended the DNA, there's nothing we can do to stop the Goa'uld DNA from eventually taking over.
It will physically overwrite the human and nothing I know of will stop it.
What's going to happen to her?
She'll die, a horrible painful death.
There's no cure, there's no way to save her.
That was just another lie.
I placed a capsule of biotoxin at the base of her brain, the remote device will activate it.
I did this to prevent any undue suffering when the time came.
How humane of you.
What do I do?
Just relax and try thinking of nothing.
Nothing?
Try an empty room.
You see a doorway, go to that door an open it.
Go through, you are inside of a stone room.
The floor is made of polished marble
You're inside of a great pyramid, where innate carvings of giant snakes flank a beautiful golden throne.
You see a window, you walk towards it.
Outside there are thousands of people, slaves who worship you as a God.
You have great power over them, power to decide who lives and who dies.
NO!
- I will tell you nothing.
- Anna?
Anna, stop!
NO!
FIRE!
FIRE!
Hurry, come on!
Hurry!
Daniel, you okay?
Where is she?
She won't get far.
All units, female prisoner is currently unaccounted for.
Secure all exits.
Repeat, secure all exits.
Target is armed and dangerous, use extreme caution.
I don't think she's acting as the Goa'uld.
Daniel!
I just need a drink of water.
Please, I'm...
I'm not feeling 100%.
My pills...
I think it's a deactivation code.
Agent Barrett, this is Major Carter, come in.
What's your location.
Agent Barrett?
This is Major Carter, Agent Barrett needs medical attention.
We are in the north-east corridor, level one.
That's it.. it's off.
I mean the lights turned off, that means it's off right?
Indeed.
Well hey!
Drop the gun.
Anna..
Drop it.
Come with me now,
I will help you.
You can't help me.
Whatever they've told you..
It doesn't matter, I never believed you.
Anna, I did it to help people.
All the evil I have seen in my mind, nothing you put inside of me, compares to what I see in you.
Anna!
What did you do?
You couldn't help me.
I'm so sorry.
Major Carter, Dr Jackson, Teal'c.
Glad you could make it.
Agent Barrett.
- How's Colonel O'Neill?
- Still recovering.
Taking some time off.
We're still putting the details together.
Follow me.
I'll explain.
- What is this place?
- An abandoned industrial complex.
It was home to a rogue NID sleeper cell we've been trying to locate for over a year.
- Still haven't got them all?
- Not by a long shot.
Their ties run deep.
They seem to have infinite resources.
- What were they doing here?
- We're not exactly sure yet.
What happened?
At approximately 0800 hours this morning, we intercepted a 911 call.
We moved in just after local authorities arrived and have been in lockdown mode.
Somebody from a top-secret, not to mention illegal, NID operation called 911?
It got real ugly.
Come on.
We got a call from a panicked male voice.
We think it was from the cleaning staff.
The call was cut short.
We've counted 32 casualties, which includes a six-man security contingent.
- Who would do this?
- And for what reason?
We know who did it.
As for why...
- You know who did this?
- Yeah.
Open it.
It was her.
At first we thought she was a survivor, and then we found this.
We found her in a corner.
She seemed terrified, no memory of what happened.
- You put her in the cell?
- She said that's where they kept her.
We locked her up after we found the security tapes.
- Who is she?
- We're not sure yet.
She's been printed.
- I'm running her through the system.
- Other survivors?
A scientist, Keffler.
We're holding him upstairs.
He hasn't been very talkative.
Come on, let me show you why I called you guys down here.
Wow.
Recognise anything?
Nothing I've catalogued as coming through the SGC.
- This indicates it belonged to Sekhmet.
- Who was that?
A Goa'uld who at one time was loyal to Ra.
She was a powerful ally of his.
He would dispatch her to rule planets in his stead.
Quell rebellions, oversee executions.
All the fun stuff.
What happened to her?
She was exiled for plotting against Ra.
We also believe she lived here for most of his dynasty.
I didn't realise this had been recovered.
- It may have come from the Germans.
- The Germans?
The background on Keffler says that he's the son of a Nazi war criminal.
- We shouldn't be that surprised.
- Rogue NID have no limits, do they?
See if there's anything else you can tell me about this stuff.
I'm going to go back at Keffler again.
Want to join me?
Sure.
Thought you might want to watch a master of interrogation at work.
You call in someone special?
Dr Keffler.
This is Major Samantha Carter.
Of the Stargate programme.
That's right.
Are you ready to tell us about the girl?
Doctor, do I really need to explain the nature of your situation?
Please do.
It amuses me.
This was an off-the-books NID operation, which means you technically don't exist, which means no phone calls, no lawyers.
I don't even have to read you your rights.
To make matters worse for you, the people behind this operation are all in jail.
Nobody to bail you out.
What kind of work was being done here, Doctor?
You're a smart girl.
You'll figure it out.
Do you think we'll let you walk away from this?
- 32 people are dead.
- Believe it or not, I do feel bad about that.
Some of them were not quite as incompetent as the others.
Unfortunately the bad ones always ruin it for everyone, don't they?
- What's this?
- That unlocks my car.
Don't think you're safe.
Read the papers, Agent Barrett.
No-one is safe these days.
My pills.
Now, now.
You wouldn't want your only witness to die on you, would you?
It's nitro.
Says he has a bad heart.
I'd say an X-ray would confirm a total absence.
- I think he's starting to crack.
- He was colder than Hannibal Lecter.
Still, obviously no match for a master interrogator.
- You didn't get all Clarice Starling on him.
- I didn't want to step on your toes.
- One more thing to show you.
- There's more?
Trust me, I'm saving the best for last.
- This isn't at all creepy.
- It gets better.
They look like partially developed foetuses.
They don't look human to me.
- Failed experiments of some kind?
- "What kind?" is the question.
Well, there's one way to find out.
No.
Forget it.
We've already tried that.
All the codes are encrypted.
- I've requested a data retrieval team.
- Present and accounted for.
Right.
Of course.
- So, how have you been?
- Busy.
You?
Busy.
You know, I never properly thanked you for that memo on Woolsey.
Maybe we could go out for dinner sometime.
- I'm seeing someone right now.
- Really?
You?
- Hm.
- Well, you asked me out.
Yeah.
Right.
Sorry.
I'm going to go check in with Dr Jackson and Teal'c.
Most of the artefacts are related in some way to Sekhmet.
I'm guessing they were found on Earth, possibly in an Egyptian tomb or crypt.
- Nothing of note?
- No, it's interesting stuff, but not really.
- What's this?
- It would appear to be an ark.
Ordained in the gold motif of Ra, the sun god.
Possibly a gift to Sekhmet.
- What's in it?
- We haven't been able to open it.
But these turn.
- Some sort of combination lock?
- So it would seem.
- Any luck with the scientist?
- No, not exactly.
The girl may be on tape killing everybody, but I'm sure that guy is not innocent.
What about that girl?
She hasn't said anything since we locked her up.
I was kind of hoping that you'd give it a try.
Me?
Heard you got a knack for this type of thing.
Hi, I'm Daniel Jackson.
You're Anna, right?
You know, when I first saw you,
I didn't believe that you could do the things they said you did.
And even after I saw it for myself, I still don't believe it.
Look, I know you don't know me and you have no reason to trust me, but...
I want to help you.
Before I do that, I need to know a few things first.
I need to know who you are.
What's happened to you.
Why you're here in a cell like this.
Do you even understand me?
- I didn't kill those people.
- There's some overwhelming evidence.
It wasn't me.
Please, you have to believe me.
It wasn't me.
Turn it off.
Turn it off!
Sorry.
I couldn't do those things.
- It looks like you did.
- It's not me.
- Then who is it?
- I don't know.
OK, where were you when this was happening?
If the person on the tape isn't you, where were you?
I don't remember.
Who is Dr Keffler?
He is the one who made me.
- She says Keffler made her.
- What does that mean?
- Some sort of genetic research?
- No, she's over 20 years old.
The Asgard can rapidly grow a human clone, but...
Area 51 has a sample of Goa'uld nanite technology from the planet Argos.
It can rapidly grow a human with the ability to learn very quickly, and the rogue NID would have had access to that.
She says Keffler is responsible for everything that happened.
- How?
- I don't know.
- Do you think she's telling the truth?
- I don't know what to think.
She believes she didn't do it.
Says the girl on the tape isn't her.
How can that be possible?
The NID have cloned a Goa'uld symbiote before.
- She could be a clone.
- There could be more than one of her.
- How well did you search the facility?
- Top to bottom.
I better put an APB out to local authorities.
Anna, how long have you lived here?
Since I remember.
Yeah?
How long is that, exactly?
I don't know.
Have you ever had a birthday?
You know, a birthday.
A cake with candles on it, funny hats, pin the tail on the donkey, that kind of thing.
He gave me this paper and some new charcoal.
Who, Dr Keffler?
He always gave me paper, but once he said it was my birthday.
Just once?
Have you ever seen anything outside of this room?
Just pictures.
I've read a lot of books which describe the world outside.
The mountains, oceans.
The sun.
But you've never experienced them first-hand?
What about these?
Those are the things I see in my dreams.
Flashes.
- They just come to me.
- Do they mean anything to you?
Just that they scare me.
If they scare you so much, why do you hang them up everywhere?
I don't want them there.
He hurts me if I take them down.
They are important to him.
Do you have any more with one of those on it?
Maybe on an ark?
I got it.
It's one of Anna's sketches.
I think it's a combination to open the ark.
- Did we just do that?
- I do not believe so.
It was activated some time ago.
I got a picture out to local authorities.
If there's a girl that looks like her, we'll find her.
- I'm in.
I have complete access.
- Nice work.
The files seem to document recent work going back over three years.
Recent work?
The artefacts go back to Napoleon.
The Nazis eventually recovered them.
They ended up in Keffler's father's hands.
They found a Canopic jar.
It's a vessel containing a preserved symbiote.
Keffler spliced human ovum with DNA taken from a Goa'uld.
- She is a human-Goa'uld hybrid.
- Goa'uld pass on knowledge genetically.
They tried to create a human who could tell them all a Goa'uld would know.
- They didn't want to wait.
- Nanite technology from Area 51.
So they could make her grow up quickly.
It took them 45 failures before they finally got it right.
- You can call off that APB.
- There's only one of her.
According to this.
The previous attempts either didn't blend properly or they grew too fast and died.
The technology had to be modified so the human could slowly learn to gain access to the genetic knowledge buried in her DNA.
My God.
They tortured the poor girl.
Sensory deprivation, electrocution.
- Major Carter.
Agent Barrett.
- She's not a clone.
There's only one of her and she's got Goa'uld DNA blended with her own.
That could explain her behaviour.
- The ark is a bomb.
- What?
- The ark is a Goa'uld explosive device.
- And it's been activated.
- How much time do we have?
- Approximately 16 hours.
How interesting.
Wipe that smarmy smile off your face and tell me what's going on here!
- You're hurting me.
- Nothing could make up for what you did.
- Agent Barrett.
- Listen to her, Agent Barrett.
You are gonna tell me everything I want to know or I'm gonna beat you senseless.
What do you want to know?
For starters, do you know how to deactivate the bomb?
I didn't know it was a bomb.
So this girl breaks out of her cell, kills 32 people, sets a bomb and then sticks around?
- How does that make sense?
- Your problem, Agent Barrett, one among many, I must point out, is that you see her as a girl.
If you're gonna give us moral justification...
Please, Major.
I know you have helped to orchestrate the death of Goa'ulds before.
Assassinated them in cold blood without regard for the life of the human host.
- I didn't create the problem.
- Neither did I.
I am merely trying to help solve it.
The Goa'uld are a terrible threat to us all.
Anna is a conduit to the knowledge that could level the playing field.
And I think we all agree that if killing one person could save millions, billions of innocent lives, you would have no choice.
You would do it.
- Answer my question.
- I'm sorry, I've forgotten what it was.
Why set the bomb and stick around?
Anna did not set that bomb.
- Then who did?
- The Goa'uld.
Sekhmet.
But wait a minute.
She doesn't have a snake inside of her, right?
It's something we didn't expect.
A separate and distinct personality.
Anna's mind has created a personality that acts like the Goa'uld Sekhmet?
Yes, but I don't know if she is incapable of dealing with the darkness within her, or if that knowledge is so powerful that it is capable of manifesting itself as such.
I only know that it emerges and speaks as a unique entity.
We have witnessed it with a growing frequency.
Anna has no awareness.
To her, it is as if she has blacked out.
The Goa'uld personality comes out, goes on a rampage, sets the bomb...
But can't stay in control of the body long enough.
Her breakthroughs are sporadic and seem somewhat uncontrolled.
- Still, why set the bomb?
- Leverage.
Against what?
Sekhmet has conscious control of the body for short periods.
She wants more.
She was gonna blackmail you with the bomb.
The psyche is so simple, isn't it?
So single-minded.
It's truly fascinating to behold.
She thinks you can give her that full control.
Can you?
She is the experiment.
I am the observer.
The Goa'uld personality didn't go do something like this on a whim.
You led her to believe that you have the power to give her control of her life, and I'll bet you did it so she would tell you what you want to know.
How to save us all, Major.
I'm not the only one who wants to know.
I don't remember anything.
I know this must be hard for you.
How can you know what this is like for me?
Cos I knew a boy once and he was like you.
- There are more like me?
- Not exactly.
He was born of two Goa'uld hosts.
They call a child like that a Harsesis.
- What happened to him?
- He was saved by a very powerful being.
He ascended to a higher plane of existence and, when he did, he gained great power himself.
He used it to show me that the knowledge and memories passed on to him by the Goa'uld genetically came with a terrible burden, and how it was wrong to seek it for any reason.
Can I be saved like him?
Maybe.
Honestly, I don't know.
Will you help us shut this bomb off?
- I don't know how.
- You do.
You knew how to open the ark.
It was in your drawings.
I don't remember turning it on.
I know, but somewhere inside your mind is the answer, and I can help you find it.
According to these readings, there's a ten-pound block of naqahdah in this thing.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It would be very bad if it went off.
It's a bomb.
Usually it's not a good thing when they go off.
Can we move this?
From what I know of Goa'uld weaponry, that would be unwise.
It may have a sensor.
Yeah, I don't even want to go there.
Let's...
Let's see if we can disarm it here.
I'll get the local authorities to evacuate the area.
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- How many miles are we talking about?
I don't know.
How big is Orange County?
You're kidding, right?
Do I look like a practical joker to you?
Images just come to me.
I draw them.
I don't know what they mean.
Just relax and think about it.
When you look at this, what comes to mind?
The blackouts.
They're happening more and more.
Do you trust me?
Do you trust me?
I want to help you.
I don't want to hurt you.
After I help you?
It's not like that.
We have to shut this bomb off.
- How many birthdays have you had?
- That's not important right now.
You sound just like him.
I heard you were in here.
What are you doing?
I noticed most of the tapes were labelled "Anna".
It's not just security footage.
It's documentation of the research.
- Anything useful?
- No.
Just something she said when we were talking, that I reminded her of Keffler.
Figured I needed to learn about how he dealt with her.
What are the chances you'll find out how to deactivate the bomb from her in time?
I don't know.
We're trying to evacuate the area.
We don't know how big the blast will be.
No pressure.
I'll leave now.
I'd feel better if you were down there working on the bomb.
Dr Lee is the best we've got and Teal'c knows more about Goa'uld weapons.
I wanted to see if there was anything more in the research notes that might help.
Like what?
If we can offer Anna a cure for her condition, she might be willing to help us.
She's been horribly mistreated and without intervention she'd have little hope of survival.
At the time they made her, they had no idea what her life span was gonna be.
Based on her current rate of growth, I estimate it can't be more than three years.
- Can you help her?
- Possibly.
We should be able to halt the rapid-growth effects of the nanites.
I doubt we can unmarry the Goa'uld DNA from hers, but we may be able to block the knowledge from her conscious mind.
Stop it from possessing her.
We've had some luck with certain drugs in similar situations.
I suppose the fact that you've had similar situations shouldn't come as a shock.
- Anything on your end?
- Keffler.
He wants to chat.
There is a cure, Anna.
You can be a normal girl, live a normal life.
You can be free, or you can continue to suffer.
I don't know anything.
Please stop.
- Stop this at once.
- Now we're getting somewhere.
- Let me out of here.
- In due time, freedom can be yours.
Do you think I will just tell you the secrets of the Goa'uld?
- If you want to live.
- You will not kill me.
I can make another as easily as I made you.
If it were up to me, given the chance
I would rip the beating heart from your chest and feed it to you.
Such colourful language.
Let's focus on the issue at hand, shall we?
Son of a bitch.
We have the same goal.
I do not wish to see my work go to waste.
Look...
I know her.
I know how her mind works.
I can get you what you need.
Yeah, I've read about your methods.
I will only talk to her.
You are welcome to be present the entire time.
What do you want?
I can't believe you'd be doing this solely for the greater good.
My freedom.
Not a chance.
I am guilty of nothing more than trying to save this world.
Just like you.
We are at war.
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
I've heard that defence.
What choice do you have?
How many people will die if that bomb goes off?
Let's consider this.
Do you have the authority to offer him immunity?
Trust me, no matter what we decide to do, no court is ever gonna hear about this.
Daniel?
- You let her out, didn't you?
- You must be Daniel Jackson.
What's going on?
He can control when the Goa'uld comes out.
It's not just random.
- He's got himself a little remote control.
- This?
Yeah.
He uses it to shock her.
He can make the Goa'uld personality appear, or kill her with it.
Why?
Other scientists gonna shut down your research, report your experiment?
You have no proof.
You brought out the Goa'uld personality, then let her out.
You murdered 32 people.
Speculation.
You can control her with that.
If you didn't want the scientists dead, why didn't you stop her?
Careful.
OK.
Just because the cover wasn't booby-trapped doesn't mean the crystals themselves are safe to touch.
That is correct.
There's no energy signatures.
I don't think there's any force fields or sensors protecting the compartment.
I am unsure which of these crystals would control detonation.
- Blue is typically for power regulation.
- Indeed.
If we remove the power regulation for the control board...
The device could explode.
Yeah.
I suppose.
It's not like I was gonna pull the yellow one.
Obviously letting Keffler anywhere near the girl is out.
And if we're gonna get the bomb deactivation code from Anna, you're gonna have to do it.
Right.
This red crystal seems to control the timer.
Now, I should be able to interface with it and hopefully reprogram it.
-
- Anything happening?
- The countdown is increasing in speed.
- What?
Did that stop it?
- Yes.
However...
- Hey, how's it coming?
Not well, I take it?
- No, we just had a little setback.
- What?
I was trying to interface with a control crystal...
The time until detonation is now less than two hours.
OK.
Let's hope that Dr Jackson is having better luck.
They're trying to evacuate people, but if that bomb goes off, people are still gonna die.
Including us?
We have a helicopter standing by to get us to a safe distance if it comes to that.
I'm hoping it doesn't, because a lot of others won't have that luxury.
I've been trying.
I can't see anything.
You know, not so long ago, I had my memories erased.
How?
It's a long story, but I was able to access certain lost memories by meditating.
A friend of mine showed me how to do it.
I think that can help you.
What I see scares me so much.
I know.
And for good reason.
Ultimately it's up to you.
I can't force you to do this and I won't.
And I promise, either way we're gonna try and help you, make it so you can live a normal life.
He always said he could do that.
The truth is, I'm not sure if we can, but we're going to try anything and everything in our power.
OK, good. 42 minutes 15 seconds and counting.
I'll check back.
Thanks.
We've got ten blocks in each direction evacuated.
- That's nowhere near enough.
- I know.
I finished going through the files on the computer.
Even if we halt the nanites' rapid-growth effect, you didn't isolate the gene with the Goa'uld genetic knowledge.
We didn't have time to sequence the entire strand.
The goal was to get the intelligence, not to create a viable living organism.
- I don't understand.
- The way he blended the DNA.
There's nothing we can do to stop the Goa'uld DNA taking over.
It will overwrite the human and nothing I know of will stop it.
- What's going to happen to her?
- She'll die.
A horrible, painful death.
There's no cure, no way to save her.
That was just another lie.
I placed a capsule of biotoxin at the base of her brain.
The remote device will activate it.
I did this to prevent any undue suffering when the time came.
How humane of you.
- What do I do?
- Just relax and try thinking of nothing.
Nothing?
Try an empty room.
You see a doorway.
Go to that door and open it.
Go through.
You're inside of a stone room.
The floor is made of polished marble.
You're inside of a great pyramid.
Ornate carvings of giant snakes flank a beautiful golden throne.
You see a window and you walk towards it.
Outside there are thousands of people.
Slaves who worship you as a god.
You have great power over them.
The power to decide who lives and who dies.
No!
- I will tell you nothing.
- Anna!
Anna, stop!
No!
Fire!
Fire!
Hurry!
Come on!
Hurry!
Daniel.
You OK?
- Where is she?
- She won't get far.
This is Agent Barrett.
The female prisoner is unaccounted for.
Secure all exits.
Secure entire perimeter and begin a full sweep.
Target is armed and dangerous.
Use extreme caution.
Ugh!
I don't think she's acting as the Goa'uld.
Daniel!
I just, uh... need a drink of water.
Please, I'm...
I'm not feeling one hundred per cent.
Agh...
My pills.
Ugh!
I think it's the deactivation code.
Agent Barrett, this is Major Carter.
Come in.
What's your location?
Agent Barrett?
This is Carter.
Agent Barrett needs medical attention.
We are in the northeast corridor, level one.
That's it.
It's off.
I mean, the lights turned off.
That means it's off, right?
Indeed.
Well, hey...
Drop the gun.
- Anna...
- Drop it!
Come with me... now... to the lab.
- I will help you.
- You can't help me.
- Whatever they've told you...
- It doesn't matter.
I never believed you.
Anna, I did it to help people.
All the evil I have seen in my mind, nothing you put inside me compares to what I see in you.
Anna!
What did you do?
You couldn't help me.
I'm so sorry.
Are you gonna stay here?
Why don't you help us at the shop?
You gotta straighten up, son...
Why don't you go home and try to spend a few days with her!
And let her be, tell her you're sorry... tell her things are going to change... that you'll find something!
What are you gonna do?
THE GREAT LEAP OF YOUR LIFE
Miss...
I wanted to know how long it took to get a degree?
Which one?
Chemical, Industrial, Electrical?
Electrical?
Five years they all take five years.
If they all take five years why do you ask which one?
Young man, everything's here in the brochures.
It's just that...
Hi, good morning...
Hey, your fly is open.
What?
- Your zipper's down.
- Oh, thanks.
You see them at the bus stop... that's what they do...
check out girls all day.
And one has to help out... one always has to help out.
On the bus you gotta keep your eyes open.
You look at everybody and figure them out... what is it they wanna do?
where do they wanna go?
Could they also be watching me?
Until they come back again... fuckers who step over anyone in the way.
You wanna do something... but you can't you control yourself... cause you're not there anymore...
now you're here you were used to saving, rescuing... coast, mountain and jungle... air, sea and land, day and night.
Not here.
Life is a psychollogy... and without order, nothing exists.
One should think before he acts... walk down the streets and analyze... draw your line, develop your strategy... because the harassment starts at any moment... the traps laid for you in the way... how are you gonna get through?
you gotta keep looking around... ready for everything, anticipating everyone... always ready to reduce the enemy... with your eyes, with your hands... you check them all out, cause it could come from anywhere... behind you they turn around... they stare at you and you have nowhere to go... they come after you and laugh at you... and you remember everything... if you had to do it, how would you?
...with terrible ideas coming to your head... the need to do something to someone, anyone... but you can't... you have to control yourself you have to think... there must be an order here, too.
When you were there all you wanted was to come back... but once you're back here... you can't wait for something to take you out... out of here and there, out of it all.
Elisa, the baby's on the floor!
Will you hold the baby!
Ok, mom, take it easy...
No one takes care of him, all day lying on the floor.
Let's go see your stupid mother.
How cute is my baby... come here, cutie... hold on one second... let's go, sweetie... we'll sell a lot at the shop today.
- Fuckin' stupid bitch!
- I'm sick of you!
What the hell is wrong with you... throwing things around my house like that!
It's okay, mom, I'll handle it.
See the trouble you make!
Sit down!
You're the best, mom.
Eat!
Sit back here!
What's wrong with you?
She should be going to school.
But she can go after work, right?
Here's money...
- ... go buy her some clothes...
- Santiago, for you.
...nice little things, so guys want to shop here.
Rata, what's up?
No, I'm staying here for a few days.
What?
What happened?
I'll go get you and we'll take your car.
See you later.
Rata... it's me, Santiago.
I fell asleep.
Let's go.
Where are the keys?
In the trunk.
So what's everybody up to?
I don't know...
I haven't seen them again.
And yourself?
What are you up to?
Nothing really.
I did some construction work... but it didn't add up to much.
I wanna get out of here.
Get out?
Where will you go?
I don't know... wherever.
I'm sick of being here like this.
Why don't you keep the car?
Use it for whatever.
Use it as a cab... that'll give you some money.
As a cab?
I don't know.
It's a shitty job.
The idea is to do something useful, you know?
...to work building something.
Yeah, but you gotta go to school for that... and how much does that cost.
Yeah, you're right.
Well, you could wait for the retirement money.
How much will they give us?
I hear 60O, 80O soles.
What are you up to, man?
Hanging in there, brother.
Not doing anything really.
What do you mean?
You gotta tell me these things.
It can't be that our front man isn't doing anything!
Why don't we get together?
Sure.
Anytime.
Things always come up.
Cool.
Let me know.
What kind of things?
All kinds... some of the good, some of the bad.
Give me your cellphone...
I'll call you later to get together.
I don't have a cellphone.
Call me home.
- Hey!
- What?
He doesn't have a cellphone.
How can it be that our front man... doesn't even have a cellphone!
- That's what I'm saying.
- We really suck.
Here's my card.
Call me.
We always hang out together... we go to the beach, we take a walk.
Cool.
We have to see how to make ends meet.
Hey, kid, how are you?
Did you sleep well?
Why so serious?
Did the little kid have nightmares?
It's so fucking hot, huh?
You're soaking wet.
Going down for breakfast?
Yes or no?
Yes.
Go on, I'll be right there.
Go.
Take a seat, please.
Listen...
I don't know if here... the thing is, I've heard of the possibility to... you see, I'm a war veteran...
I fought three years for my country.
Here's my certificate.
I wanted to know... what kind of financial aid could I get?
I think there are scholarships, things like that, right?
No, young man, it's not like that here.
Scholarship programs only apply in the provinces not in Lima.
You see...
I don't have a job out there but I know how to do things...
I know electrical stuff, carpentry... a bit of everything really.
So maybe you could take that into account...
I could take an exam... then you'll see... and I could start at some advanced level.
No, young man, we can't do that here.
And how long does it take for a degree?
It takes three years... it's six terms.
Three years... damn it...
what should I do?
The monthly fee is 20O soles... 200 soles... damn it...
what should I do?
Three years... 200 soles...
What should I do?
..
What the fuck should I do?
Let's see...
what else is there?
Plan B...
a cute little brothel... we go to the jungle, and open a whorehouse right there in a small boat.
Sure, some canoe, whatever...
Five chicks, we buy them some clothes... and we got it made...
a travelling whorehouse.
Yeah, I see...
delivery!
You guys remember Officer Cacique?
That fucker opened a nightclub!
He started dealing with gold and drugs... then he built his club... and the piece of shit lives like a king!
That guy was a son of a bitch.
A motherfucker, remember?
He used to get drunk all the time... raped the girls in the village... ran away from the base... we'd find him wasted in the middle of town.
What a piece of shit.
What if we go to the jungle and work on cocaine?
We know the terrain... we know all the bosses, and they know us, too.
The problem with that is it's easy to get in... cause they know us... but once you wanna get out with your money... you think they'll let you?
No, man, there's no way out of that.
There we were the best... armed up to our teeth, we destroyed everything... we decapitated terrorists, buried ecuadorians... that's how it was...
killing all the time... men, women and children...
every day... here, we're nothing now... some work as busdrivers...
others as bodyguards... war veterans are everywhere... but nobody recognizes us... nobody knows who we are... but you can recognize a war veteran... by the way he carries his gun... the way he walks, the way he looks.
That's it... you've seen the Credit Bank in La Molina?
A bank, guys, a fucking bank!
We design our operation like any other mission... and that's it... check out the security, the takeovers... just a matter of practice... we're five... we get one more guy, and that's it... perfect.
A bank...
allright but no shooting...
no killing anybody.
But it has to be like back then... kill before you get killed... you shoot down a cop, fucking bad luck for him.
But we've gotten out of everything... only to go back to the same shit!
Remember how it was... you always figured your way out of everything, right?
Now it's a matter of figuring out a way here... do things as if it were another mission... and we all work on it together.
Then we should call up Amasifuen.
And Rata, he can help us plan the whole thing.
No, Rata won't like to get into this.
But that's when you come in, Santiago... talk to him, and we will get together tonight.
What is it, Santiago?
Quit military life to start robbing banks?
I don't get it...
What's the point?
Risk our lives again?
It's just as dangerous, why go back to the same stress.
Here they'll never remember us... or what we've done.
We gotta do something, man.
You told him already?
.
When is he gonna leave?
You done here?
Go check on the girl, then clean up the rooms.
That's my kid.
How are you?
Look up!
Look at me in the eyes!
That's more like a real man!
None of my kids look away from me!
What's up, son?
Calm down, you're with daddy.
Tell me, how are things?
It's tough... jobs that I don't want... as a guard, as a servant.
But you gotta do something... your mom told you already?
.
What?
That I can't stay here anymore.
You gotta solve your problems, son.
Can I stay for lunch today?
.
Of course, son!
- Just for today
- No, no... whenever you want.
Just go on now... but remember... whatever you need... from the bottom of my heart... you can count on me, son.
Rata!
Ambush at 3!
I don't know, brother... something will come up.
Listen, the bank job might be dangerous... but it's the only thing we've figured out.
Let's do it, man... for old times' sake.
Just to have a mission again.
You're the only one missing.
I've already made up my mind here.
I quit the navy... to clean up my conscience because just as I can't sleep at night...
I know you can't either.
Do you sleep?
And if we go on with things like that... we'll never have a clear conscience.
I remember everything... every day and it doesn't let me sleep.
I wanna take it easy now don't wanna fill up my head with more stuff.
Buddy, how much to Arriola?
5 soles.
Let's make it 4, okay?
.
Hey, man, to Averno?
To the Herradura?
How much to the Arenales Mall?
3 soles.
Let's go.
Shut the fuck up!
Everything's fucked here!
We should kill all these fucks!
Here...
Thanks.
To "Calle 8"?
"Calle 8"!
You're kidding... don't tell me you don't know where "Calle 8" is!
It's right here, I'll show you.
You brought your party clothes, right?
What a whore!
You leave the books at home and go out like this!
It's the bad influence
What bad influence!
With that angel face, she's worse than us!
On the corner take a left...
Weren't you in class today?
.
Of course, you sat at the back... remember?
What a player!
At least let the driver go!
Yeah, shut up, we're almost there.
Where you see those people, that's it.
How should we split it?
Whatever!
For being a player now you pay!
Why don't you come, have a few drinks... being in classes sucks!
come... forget the teachers and everything.
The guy's mute, girl, let's go.
To Campo de Marte?
Let's go.
You ask me how I'd like it to be?
You really want me to tell you?
Listen, Mari, this is this... the table is the table...
it isn't anything else the floor is the floor, here we eat, there we walk... everything has a reason for being without order, nothing exists.
I was thinking now... and wrote down a plan here
Starting tomorrow... we'll sleep until seven... we'll make breakfast in half an hour we'll have it between 7:30 and 8... then I go to class, you go to the market... buy all you need for lunch... and we have lunch at 14 hours when I get back.
For breakfast we can have whatever you want... always with some soy or cereal.
For lunch on mondays ceviche tuesdays, chicken, wednesdays, beans, thursdays, noodles, fridays, quinua... saturdays, you do whatever you want... don't think I'm trying to impose things on you... and sundays, we eat out.
Then I take the car... you do whatever you have to do.
This is this, the kitchen, the table... everything has an order, a reason... without order, nothing...
I'm the man, you're the woman.
I prepared something here...
I was just waiting for you to ask
Seven... wake up...
seven thirty... breakfast... to class... market...
lunch...
Want some bread?
There's no butter or cheese... there's nothing.
They paid me.
They gave me my retirement money... and I've started using Rata's car as a cab.
And you wanted to give it to me?
You keep it, Santiago
I don't need it.
Besides, we have to buy a few things... we gotta fix the kitchen, finish up the house, right?
I'm exhausted...
I saw a fridge that I liked... we gotta buy one, we can't go on like this... we can't keep any food.
Let's go buy it on Thursday, okay?
.
I can't tomorrow.
What?
Are you going out?
Eat your bread!
Eat your bread... eat your bread!
And don't forget, the fridge on Thursday, ok?
Now eat your bread.
Is mom home?
In her room.
Can you take me for a ride?
Wait up, gotta give something to mom.
She's locked herself in her room since the morning.
She'll be out soon... let's go for a ride... when we get back I'm sure she'll be out.
Where do you think you're going!
It's Coco and Elisa... they always go at it like that.
One of these days I'm gonna kill you!
You're a piece of shit!
Come on, let's go for a ride.
- Fag!
- Bitch!
What the fuck are you looking at!
Let's go, Santiago...
Fuck off!
Just for a little while.
...you won't make enough money, you'll get robbed... but that's not it.
The real problem... is that you're sitting down all day.
At the beginning that's okay, but after one, two years?
your kidneys break into pieces... and your bones, and everything goes bad... because each minute that goes by... the cartilages in your body wear out... you'll suffer when you're old... that's the real problem of the cabdriver.
So you have to exercise... run at least two hours a day... to improve your blood circulation because your blood's in your feet all day... and you destroy your kidneys!
Leave me here!
- What?
- Let me off here!
Where have I told you to stand!
Who said you could go for a ride!
No, that's all yours, don't give me anything.
And Mari, how is she?
Go take that money to her... buy things for your home.
That girl loves you... you should make it work together.
I'm sure she wants to have kids... have you talked about that?
It's time, right?
Leave.
Six years there... no weekends, no parties, nothing.
Here... three in the afternoon, a weekday, and look... they're all dancing, drinking... having a good time.
All the kids from the institutes... all the youth from Lima... the future of the country... here there are no missions or ambushes.
Six years unable to have a good time like all the rest.
So you did hang out here!
- Want a beer?
- No.
I wasn't gonna give it to you anyway.
- Let's go dance.
- What?
- Let's go dance!
- No!
I don't dance.
I don't know how to.
Forget him, let's go.
First, you have to analyze everything... figure out how things work... do a follow-up and distinguish... how everyone dances, how they look at each other.
then you choose, at the back... someone who looks lonely... someone you want to rescue.
Then... you figure out a strategy
The first step... ask her to dance... you tidy up yourself and walk to her the key is to be nice, polite... they like that.
Cause if you go and say
"girl, how's it gonna be?"
that won't get you anywhere.
You look at her, tidy up, walk... and try to be a real gentleman.
You smile, cause otherwise... she won't look at you the same way... and you say...
"excuse me, friend, do you dance?"
and that's it.
The second step... talk to her.
Now that depends on how she dances... if she lets you guide, if she makes eye contact... you just go with the flow... and dance to her rhythm.
Only then you start the conversation...
"excuse me, friend, what's your name?"
"Carla"
"How old are you?"
"Eighteen"
"Where do you live?
You go to school, right?"
"How did you know?"
"I go to school, too"
And when the song's over...
Carla, I'm by myself... would it be okay if we hang out together?
And that's it.
You tidy up and walk...
that's it.
You just gotta take the first step... but that's it.
I suppose you'd like to buy it on credit, right?
Yes
Well, there's an initial fee of 100 dollars... then you have to pay 33 dollars... every month for two years.
Yeah, we know.
What company do you work for?
My husband is a retired marine.
Ministry of Defence...
Peruvian Navy...
Armed Forces Unit...
Naval I.D. Card...
Third Sea Official...
Navy Seal Santiago Roman Arce.
Yeah, sure... but if it has expired... it has no value now, you're retired.
But there must be a way... considering what I am, right?
Listen, pal, if you wanna buy... a fridge without any troubles... you must earn at least 80O soles monthly.
Well, this is how much they gave us as retirement.
Let's see... sure, this would be enough... for the first months, but then?
Well, then I'll get some more.
You say it's 33 dollars each month...
I can get that.
I'd like you to understand... that if fees add up... then we'll have serious trouble.
Then what are you saying?
That I can't get 33 dollars a month... to pay for a fridge!
Mister, it's not my fault I've been paid so little... but there's no need to mock me.
I'm not mocking you.
What I want you to understand is... maybe there are other things you need money for.
Or does your wife have a job?
What do you care!
Is that enough to make fun of me?
Pal, I'm not at all.
I've fought for my country, mister!
What have you done for your country?
.
I'm sorry but those are the conditions.
You think you can humiliate me... in front of my wife and all these people!
Calm down.
Is it my fault what the government pays!
And is it mine?
You still mock me!
Please, sir, be kind enough to leave.
Just one more thing... he made fun of me, humiliated me... let him say just one more thing...
I've been useful, sir... what's your use?
just one more word.
What!
Nothing, forget it, let's go home.
I'll look somewhere else and I'll pay.
Don't you worry about it.
Don't assume you always have to pay!
Where did you park the car?
Why is it in your sick mind...
They're so much fun, huh?
Yeah, they're the best.
It's strange... you seem so different.
Think so?
We all do the same things.
You go out with them every day?
.
Every single day.
Thanks, see you later.
You fucked up with your woman now... now you just have to make an effort
I'm not saying you should buy her flowers or anything but...
I don't know... buy her an apron, a broom... one of those things women like.
Why do you look at me like that?
What's your problem?
I know I also beat up Elisa...
I tell her I'm gonna kill her and everything, but a couple of blows and that's it... you gotta keep things in peace, man.
Gotta go.
Wait up... where are you going?
Let's go for a couple of drinks.
Sorry.
You're fucked up, man... fucked up!
What if both of them are at the disco?
We'll let you know.
Still I'm gonna have to make up my mind.
Whoever buys you more beer is the one!
I think you should choose the most polite one.
Who's nicer?
The best kisser!
What way is this, man?
I turn right here, and that's it.
Isn't it longer this way?
.
But it's a different way.
So?
I always take different ways... always... hadn't you realized?
When I go to class... when I give you guys a lift, too...
I just know there's always somebody following me.
There's nothing wrong with that... that's just the way I think...
It's okay...
I'm just more calmed that way.
And if someone comes and says... that there's no one following me...
I tell him he's crazy... there's always somebody right there behind you.
Okay... cool...
great...
later.
Mari?
- Andrea?
- Over there!
Is it true you're quitting school?
You can't quit!
You can't stop studying!
Or try to apply again next year for college.
Maybe if you were old or sick... but look at you!
You're perfect
The luck you have... you know what would have happened... a few years ago had you been a guy?
.
They'd have enlisted you, and taken you... to fight the terrorists, the ecuadorians!
Jesus, if I'd only had the opportunities you guys have now.
You have what's most important!
You gonna get like that over nothing?
You haven't even began, how old are you?
18?
Seventeen.
Jesus, so young.
Have a drink.
Better?
Cheers.
Gotta go to the bathroom...
be right back.
We're leaving!
Wait up!
Sandra's still dancing.
What's with the face?
Besides, my friend went to the bathroom...
I have to wait for him.
Then I'm leaving.
Santiago!
Why do they like that?
What?
It shouldn't be like that.
Why do they like guys... who just want them as a pastime?
What's that good for, they deserve better.
And what about guys?
They're with anybody just to kill time!
Why can't we do the same thing!
And why are you defending them?
Do you go around chasing guys all day, too?
Well, I don't.
You see.
You're not like that.
Yeah, but I don't see anything wrong with it.
If they like it, cool.
Why don't we go out tomorrow?
Sure, we'll meet at "Calle 8"
No, not there, come on... it gets tiring.
Why don't we go out by ourselves?
No.
What for?
Bye.
Elisa?
What happened?
Your brother is crazy... he beats me up every day... said he's gonna kill me next time.
You going out again?
No.
I thought you were gonna kick me out yesterday.
But you understand, right?
I know you realize.
What?
Your brother... he's like a little beast
You know what I've been thinking?
What?
Cause with your fucked up brother everything went to hell.
How come I didn't marry you?
So quiet and nice.
That's what I've been thinking... since you came back.
Don't get scared now...
What do you say?
.
Why are you still with him?
You should start a new life elsewhere you say yourself he's a waste, an animal why do you go on?
Where am I gonna go?
Imagine me by myself!
So then what?
So then it's you, Santiago...
Wouldn't you like to find me here every night?
Have me here every time you get home?
Well then...
There... when you were there... do you remember how many it was... do you remember how many you killed?
You don't... you just killed, right?
If it were the same here... if you had to kill to move on... and if I asked you to... would you do it?
To always have me here?
What's your problem, buddy?
.
Wanna fuck up her life!
I don't get a word you're saying!
Speak up, fucker!
Besides, in those years... there were no jobs... there was terrorism... blackouts... the sure thing was military life.
And why didn't you stay?
.
Because of people... people in there who are totally rotten.
If you're not like them, they don't care.
They'll lock you up.
They'll kill you.
Anything can happen to you.
At the beginning you love everything... you like all that shit.
It's the best... to go out on patrol with your friends... to go out on missions... it's so much fun.
Being in the jungle... carrying your gun, your grenades... the adrenaline rush... you feel like Rambo!
Anything can happen... anything.
For example... what if you're out on patrol... and someone farts.
You're there... middle of the jungle, middle of the night... a fart.
What do you do?
It could be the enemy's, they could be next to you.
Quickly you have to smell the fart... is it Rata's?
Yogui's?
Hitler's?
And if you don't know your friends' farts you're fucked!
Cause you can locate the enemy through a fart... but they can also find you out.
And if you don't realize, you're screwed... stones start flying all over, the shooting breaks out... and people start to fall dead.
And everything for a fart.
What?
No, nothing...
I just didn't think...
What?
I mean... if you wanna be more than friends, that's okay... but maybe there's no need to rush into it.
Hey... do you still carry a gun?
You do, right?
Come on, let me see... show me your gun
Let go!
...and now we go live with Monica Castro-Iglesias who's by the Commercial Bank that was robbed yesterday.
Thanks...
we're back at the location... to give you exclusive information.
The authors of the 40,000-dollar robbery might be ex-Navy Seals.
That's the hypothesis... given the initial investigations... supported mainly by witness declarations... confirming that the behavior of these robbers... wasn't that of ordinary thieves.
The investigation would have arrived at the identification... of three of the possible robbers... two of them with a history in similar crimes.
They are...
Antonio Quispe.
known as "Farandula"...
Sandro Castro, known as "Cool mac Cool"... and Igor Merino, known as "Buitro".
The terrible thing about this information... is that it deals with people who served our country... and who would have gone from being almost heroes... to skillful criminals.
That's it for the moment...
I came to...
To what?
Yesterday I went home and you weren't there...
I thought you were gonna stay, what happened?
Come in...
He's sleeping.
I came to take you away, as you said you wanted.
Sure, sure, but come...
Wait.
You want me to talk to him?
He's drunk, Santiago... what could you say!
What are you doing?
You liked it the other day, right?
What?
you gonna tell me you're afraid of him?
Aren't you?
Didn't...
Couldn't you be a bit more dignified... and not be such a disgusting whore!
What have you been telling this guy?
.
Fucking bitch!
- Leave her
- No, let me go!
Let me go and listen!
Come on, tell him... do you really want me to leave you?
Let him hear it!
What's happened to you?
It's okay now.
Good morning, sir, where are you going?
Wait on the side, please.
On the streets you realize... that being here is worse than being there.
Sometimes I wish I could go back there... with everybody else... go out on patrol... on missions... and save... at least one.
I'm not going anymore.
Then let's go talk somewhere else, like you wanted.
What for?
Just to talk... you know I don't want anything else.
I got that pretty clear the other day.
Andrea... you know we get along very well...
I know you like me...
I don't know anymore.
But you always liked talking to me, right?
You always looked very comfortable.
Look... the other day... don't be scared, it's my gun.
The other day you wanted me to show you my gun, right?
Here it is.
See?
- Okay, Santiago.
- But hold it.
Hold it.
Didn't you want the gun?
Grab it... it has no bullets, you can play around with it.
No bullets, see?
Hey, what's going on!
These people, huh?
They don't realize anything, right?
You are different, do you realize?
Get back!
Everybody down!
Calm down, don't worry...
I'll save you, I'll get you out... your hands on your head!
Drop the gun!
Shut up, motherfucker!
Open the door!
Stay back, pal
Let the girl go.
Elisa, listen to me...
I've come to take you with me.
Listen to me!
If you don't come with me, he'll end up killing you.
And if he doesn't, then you will.
Coco!
Shut up!
Didn't you want me to kill him!
Have you told him to kill me now!
Let him go!
He better take off and not come back again!
He won't, but let him go!
Santiago, please, go... why does it have to be like this with you!
You never listen!
No, Santiago, please, son... forget about them... they have their lives... she'll never go with you!
Please, listen to me!
We have our own lives here... let us be.
Please, son, you have to go...
Son, please, no... you'll ruin your life!
Are you gonna stay here?
Why don't you help us at the shop?
You gotta straighten up, son...
Why don't you go home and try to spend a few days with her!
And let her be, tell her you're sorry... tell her things are going to change... that you'll find something!
What are you gonna do?
THE GREAT LEAP OF YOUR LIFE
Miss...
I wanted to know how long it took to get a degree?
Which one?
Chemical, Industrial, Electrical?
Electrical?
Five years they all take five years.
If they all take five years why do you ask which one?
Young man, everything's here in the brochures.
It's just that...
Hi, good morning...
Hey, your fly is open.
What?
- Your zipper's down.
- Oh, thanks.
You see them at the bus stop... that's what they do...
check out girls all day.
And one has to help out... one always has to help out.
On the bus you gotta keep your eyes open.
You look at everybody and figure them out... what is it they wanna do?
Where do they wanna go?
Could they also be watching me?
Until they come back again... fuckers who step over anyone in the way.
You wanna do something... but you can't you control yourself... cause you're not there anymore...
now you're here you were used to saving, rescuing... coast, mountain and jungle... air, sea and land, day and night.
Not here.
Life is a psychollogy... and without order, nothing exists.
One should think before he acts... walk down the streets and analyze... draw your line, develop your strategy... because the harassment starts at any moment... the traps laid for you in the way... how are you gonna get through?
You gotta keep looking around... ready for everything, anticipating everyone... always ready to reduce the enemy... with your eyes, with your hands... you check them all out, cause it could come from anywhere... behind you they turn around... they stare at you and you have nowhere to go... they come after you and laugh at you... and you remember everything... if you had to do it, how would you?
... with terrible ideas coming to your head... the need to do something to someone, anyone... but you can't... you have to control yourself you have to think... there must be an order here, too.
When you were there all you wanted was to come back... but once you're back here... you can't wait for something to take you out... out of here and there, out of it all.
Elisa, the baby's on the floor!
Will you hold the baby!
Ok, mom, take it easy...
No one takes care of him, all day lying on the floor.
Let's go see your stupid mother.
How cute is my baby... come here, cutie... hold on one second... let's go, sweetie... we'll sell a lot at the shop today.
- Fuckin' stupid bitch!
- I'm sick of you!
What the hell is wrong with you... throwing things around my house like that!
It's okay, mom, I'll handle it.
See the trouble you make!
Sit down!
You're the best, mom.
Eat!
Sit back here!
What's wrong with you?
She should be going to school.
But she can go after work, right?
Here's money go buy her some clothes...
- Santiago, for you.
...nice little things, so guys want to shop here.
Rata, what's up?
No, I'm staying here for a few days.
What?
What happened?
I'll go get you and we'll take your car.
See you later.
Rata... it's me, Santiago.
I fell asleep.
Let's go.
Where are the keys?
In the trunk.
So what's everybody up to?
I don't know...
I haven't seen them again.
And yourself?
What are you up to?
Nothing really.
I did some construction work... but it didn't add up to much.
I wanna get out of here.
Get out?
Where will you go?
I don't know... wherever.
I'm sick of being here like this.
Why don't you keep the car?
Use it for whatever.
Use it as a cab... that'll give you some money.
As a cab?
I don't know.
It's a shitty job.
The idea is to do something useful, you know?
...to work building something.
Yeah, but you gotta go to school for that... and how much does that cost.
Yeah, you're right.
Well, you could wait for the retirement money.
How much will they give us?
I hear 600, 800 soles.
What are you up to, man?
Hanging in there, brother.
Not doing anything really.
What do you mean?
You gotta tell me these things.
It can't be that our front man isn't doing anything!
Why don't we get together?
Sure.
Anytime.
Things always come up.
Cool.
Let me know.
What kind of things?
All kinds... some of the good, some of the bad.
Give me your cellphone...
I'll call you later to get together.
I don't have a cellphone.
Call me home.
- Hey!
- What?
He doesn't have a cellphone.
How can it be that our front man... doesn't even have a cellphone!
- That's what I'm saying.
- We really suck.
Here's my card.
Call me.
We always hang out together... we go to the beach, we take a walk.
Cool.
We have to see how to make ends meet.
Hey, kid, how are you?
Did you sleep well?
Why so serious?
Did the little kid have nightmares?
It's so fucking hot, huh?
You're soaking wet.
Going down for breakfast?
Yes or no?
Yes.
Go on, I'll be right there.
Go.
Take a seat, please.
Listen...
I don't know if here... the thing is, I've heard of the possibility to... you see, I'm a war veteran...
I fought three years for my country.
Here's my certificate.
I wanted to know... what kind of financial aid could I get?
I think there are scholarships, things like that, right?
No, young man, it's not like that here.
Scholarship programs only apply in the provinces not in Lima.
You see...
I don't have a job out there but I know how to do things...
I know electrical stuff, carpentry... a bit of everything really.
So maybe you could take that into account...
I could take an exam... then you'll see... and I could start at some advanced level.
No, young man, we can't do that here.
And how long does it take for a degree?
It takes three years... it's six terms.
Three years... damn it...
what should I do?
The monthly fee is 200 soles... 200 soles... damn it...
what should I do?
Three years... 200 soles...
What should I do?
What the fuck should I do?
Let's see...
what else is there?
Plan B...
a cute little brothel... we go to the jungle, and open a whorehouse right there in a small boat.
Sure, some canoe, whatever...
Five chicks, we buy them some clothes... and we got it made...
a travelling whorehouse.
Yeah, I see...
delivery!
You guys remember Officer Cacique?
That fucker opened a nightclub!
He started dealing with gold and drugs... then he built his club... and the piece of shit lives like a king!
That guy was a son of a bitch.
A motherfucker, remember?
He used to get drunk all the time... raped the girls in the village... ran away from the base... we'd find him wasted in the middle of town.
What a piece of shit.
What if we go to the jungle and work on cocaine?
We know the terrain... we know all the bosses, and they know us, too.
The problem with that is it's easy to get in... cause they know us... but once you wanna get out with your money... you think they'll let you?
No, man, there's no way out of that.
There we were the best... armed up to our teeth, we destroyed everything... we decapitated terrorists, buried ecuadorians... that's how it was...
killing all the time... men, women and children...
every day... here, we're nothing now... some work as busdrivers...
others as bodyguards... war veterans are everywhere... but nobody recognizes us... nobody knows who we are... but you can recognize a war veteran... by the way he carries his gun... the way he walks, the way he looks.
That's it... you've seen the Credit Bank in La Molina?
A bank, guys, a fucking bank!
We design our operation like any other mission... and that's it... check out the security, the takeovers... just a matter of practice... we're five... we get one more guy, and that's it... perfect.
A bank...
allright but no shooting...
no killing anybody.
But it has to be like back then... kill before you get killed... you shoot down a cop, fucking bad luck for him.
But we've gotten out of everything... only to go back to the same shit!
Remember how it was... you always figured your way out of everything, right?
Now it's a matter of figuring out a way here... do things as if it were another mission... and we all work on it together.
Then we should call up Amasifuen.
And Rata, he can help us plan the whole thing.
No, Rata won't like to get into this.
But that's when you come in, Santiago... talk to him, and we will get together tonight.
What is it, Santiago?
Quit military life to start robbing banks?
I don't get it...
What's the point?
Risk our lives again?
It's just as dangerous, why go back to the same stress.
Here they'll never remember us... or what we've done.
We gotta do something, man.
You told him already?
When is he gonna leave?
You done here?
Go check on the girl, then clean up the rooms.
That's my kid.
How are you?
Look up!
Look at me in the eyes!
That's more like a real man!
None of my kids look away from me!
What's up, son?
Calm down, you're with daddy.
Tell me, how are things?
It's tough... jobs that I don't want... as a guard, as a servant.
But you gotta do something... your mom told you already?
What?
That I can't stay here anymore.
You gotta solve your problems, son.
Can I stay for lunch today?
Of course, son!
- Just for today
- No, no... whenever you want.
Just go on now... but remember... whatever you need... from the bottom of my heart... you can count on me, son.
Rata!
Ambush at 3!
I don't know, brother... something will come up.
Listen, the bank job might be dangerous... but it's the only thing we've figured out.
Let's do it, man... for old times' sake.
Just to have a mission again.
You're the only one missing.
I've already made up my mind here.
I quit the navy... to clean up my conscience because just as I can't sleep at night...
I know you can't either.
Do you sleep?
And if we go on with things like that... we'll never have a clear conscience.
I remember everything... every day and it doesn't let me sleep.
I wanna take it easy now don't wanna fill up my head with more stuff.
Buddy, how much to Arriola?
5 soles.
Let's make it 4, okay?
Hey, man, to Averno?
To the Herradura?
How much to the Arenales Mall?
3 soles.
Let's go.
Shut the fuck up!
Everything's fucked here!
We should kill all these fucks!
Here...
Thanks.
To "Calle 8"?
"Calle 8"!
You're kidding... don't tell me you don't know where "Calle 8" is!
It's right here, I'll show you.
You brought your party clothes, right?
What a whore!
You leave the books at home and go out like this!
It's the bad influence
What bad influence!
With that angel face, she's worse than us!
On the corner take a left...
Weren't you in class today?
Of course, you sat at the back... remember?
What a player!
At least let the driver go!
Yeah, shut up, we're almost there.
Where you see those people, that's it.
How should we split it?
Whatever!
For being a player now you pay!
Why don't you come, have a few drinks... being in classes sucks!
Come... forget the teachers and everything.
The guy's mute, girl, let's go.
To Campo de Marte?
Let's go.
You ask me how I'd like it to be?
You really want me to tell you?
Listen, Mari, this is this... the table is the table...
it isn't anything else the floor is the floor, here we eat, there we walk... everything has a reason for being without order, nothing exists.
I was thinking now... and wrote down a plan here
Starting tomorrow... we'll sleep until seven... we'll make breakfast in half an hour we'll have it between 7:30 and 8... then I go to class, you go to the market... buy all you need for lunch... and we have lunch at 14 hours when I get back.
For breakfast we can have whatever you want... always with some soy or cereal.
For lunch on mondays ceviche tuesdays, chicken, wednesdays, beans, thursdays, noodles, fridays, quinua... saturdays, you do whatever you want... don't think I'm trying to impose things on you... and sundays, we eat out.
Then I take the car... you do whatever you have to do.
This is this, the kitchen, the table... everything has an order, a reason... without order, nothing...
I'm the man, you're the woman.
I prepared something here...
I was just waiting for you to ask
Seven... wake up...
seven thirty... breakfast... to class... market...
lunch...
Want some bread?
There's no butter or cheese... there's nothing.
They paid me.
They gave me my retirement money... and I've started using Rata's car as a cab.
And you wanted to give it to me?
You keep it, Santiago
I don't need it.
Besides, we have to buy a few things... we gotta fix the kitchen, finish up the house, right?
I'm exhausted...
I saw a fridge that I liked... we gotta buy one, we can't go on like this... we can't keep any food.
Let's go buy it on Thursday, okay?
I can't tomorrow.
What?
Are you going out?
Eat your bread!
Eat your bread... eat your bread!
And don't forget, the fridge on Thursday, ok?
Now eat your bread.
Is mom home?
In her room.
Can you take me for a ride?
Wait up, gotta give something to mom.
She's locked herself in her room since the morning.
She'll be out soon... let's go for a ride... when we get back I'm sure she'll be out.
Where do you think you're going!
It's Coco and Elisa... they always go at it like that.
One of these days I'm gonna kill you!
You're a piece of shit!
Come on, let's go for a ride.
- Fag!
- Bitch!
What the fuck are you looking at!
Let's go, Santiago...
Fuck off!
Just for a little while.
...you won't make enough money, you'll get robbed... but that's not it.
The real problem... is that you're sitting down all day.
At the beginning that's okay, but after one, two years?
Your kidneys break into pieces... and your bones, and everything goes bad... because each minute that goes by... the cartilages in your body wear out... you'll suffer when you're old... that's the real problem of the cabdriver.
So you have to exercise... run at least two hours a day... to improve your blood circulation because your blood's in your feet all day... and you destroy your kidneys!
Leave me here!
- What?
- Let me off here!
Where have I told you to stand!
Who said you could go for a ride!
No, that's all yours, don't give me anything.
And Mari, how is she?
Go take that money to her... buy things for your home.
That girl loves you... you should make it work together.
I'm sure she wants to have kids... have you talked about that?
It's time, right?
Leave.
Six years there... no weekends, no parties, nothing.
Here... three in the afternoon, a weekday, and look... they're all dancing, drinking... having a good time.
All the kids from the institutes... all the youth from Lima... the future of the country... here there are no missions or ambushes.
Six years unable to have a good time like all the rest.
So you did hang out here!
- Want a beer?
- No.
I wasn't gonna give it to you anyway.
- Let's go dance.
- What?
- Let's go dance!
- No!
I don't dance.
I don't know how to.
Forget him, let's go.
First, you have to analyze everything... figure out how things work... do a follow-up and distinguish... how everyone dances, how they look at each other.
Then you choose, at the back... someone who looks lonely... someone you want to rescue.
Then... you figure out a strategy
The first step... ask her to dance... you tidy up yourself and walk to her the key is to be nice, polite... they like that.
Cause if you go and say
"girl, how's it gonna be?"
That won't get you anywhere.
You look at her, tidy up, walk... and try to be a real gentleman.
You smile, cause otherwise... she won't look at you the same way... and you say...
"excuse me, friend, do you dance?"
And that's it.
The second step... talk to her.
Now that depends on how she dances... if she lets you guide, if she makes eye contact... you just go with the flow... and dance to her rhythm.
Only then you start the conversation...
"excuse me, friend, what's your name?"
"Carla"
"How old are you?"
"Eighteen"
"Where do you live?
You go to school, right?"
"How did you know?"
"I go to school, too"
And when the song's over...
Carla, I'm by myself... would it be okay if we hang out together?
And that's it.
You tidy up and walk...
that's it.
You just gotta take the first step... but that's it.
I suppose you'd like to buy it on credit, right?
Yes
Well, there's an initial fee of 100 dollars... then you have to pay 33 dollars... every month for two years.
Yeah, we know.
What company do you work for?
My husband is a retired marine.
Ministry of Defence...
Peruvian Navy...
Armed Forces Unit...
Naval I.D. Card...
Third Sea Official...
Navy Seal Santiago Roman Arce.
Yeah, sure... but if it has expired... it has no value now, you're retired.
But there must be a way... considering what I am, right?
Listen, pal, if you wanna buy... a fridge without any troubles... you must earn at least 800 soles monthly.
Well, this is how much they gave us as retirement.
Let's see... sure, this would be enough... for the first months, but then?
Well, then I'll get some more.
You say it's 33 dollars each month...
I can get that.
I'd like you to understand... that if fees add up... then we'll have serious trouble.
Then what are you saying?
That I can't get 33 dollars a month... to pay for a fridge!
Mister, it's not my fault I've been paid so little... but there's no need to mock me.
I'm not mocking you.
What I want you to understand is... maybe there are other things you need money for.
Or does your wife have a job?
What do you care!
Is that enough to make fun of me?
Pal, I'm not at all.
I've fought for my country, mister!
What have you done for your countrt?
I'm sorry but those are the conditions.
You think you can humiliate me... in front of my wife and all these people!
Calm down.
Is it my fault what the government pays!
And is it mine?
You still mock me!
Please, sir, be kind enough to leave.
Just one more thing... he made fun of me, humiliated me... let him say just one more thing...
I've been useful, sir... what's your use?
Just one more word.
What!
Nothing, forget it, let's go home.
I'll look somewhere else and I'll pay.
Don't you worry about it.
Don't assume you always have to pay!
Where did you park the car?
Why is it in your sick mind...
They're so much fun, huh?
Yeah, they're the best.
It's strange... you seem so different.
Think so?
We all do the same things.
You go out with them every day?
Every single day.
Thanks, see you later.
You fucked up with your woman now... now you just have to make an effort
I'm not saying you should buy her flowers or anything but...
I don't know... buy her an apron, a broom... one of those things women like.
Why do you look at me like that?
What's your problem?
I know I also beat up Elisa...
I tell her I'm gonna kill her and everything, but a couple of blows and that's it... you gotta keep things in peace, man.
Gotta go.
Wait up... where are you going?
Let's go for a couple of drinks.
Sorry.
You're fucked up, man... fucked up!
What if both of them are at the disco?
We'll let you know.
Still I'm gonna have to make up my mind.
Whoever buys you more beer is the one!
I think you should choose the most polite one.
Who's nicer?
The best kisser!
What way is this, man?
I turn right here, and that's it.
Isn't it longer this way?
But it's a different way.
So?
I always take different ways... always... hadn't you realized?
When I go to class... when I give you guys a lift, too...
I just know there's always somebody following me.
There's nothing wrong with that... that's just the way I think...
It's okay...
I'm just more calmed that way.
And if someone comes and says... that there's no one following me...
I tell him he's crazy... there's always somebody right there behind you.
Okay... cool...
great...
later.
Mari?
- Andrea?
- Over there!
Is it true you're quitting school?
You can't quit!
You can't stop studying!
Or try to apply again next year for college.
Maybe if you were old or sick... but look at you!
You're perfect
The luck you have... you know what would have happened... a few years ago had you been a guy?
They'd have enlisted you, and taken you... to fight the terrorists, the ecuadorians!
Jesus, if I'd only had the opportunities you guys have now.
You have what's most important!
You gonna get like that over nothing?
You haven't even began, how old are you?
18?
Seventeen.
Jesus, so young.
Have a drink.
Better?
Cheers.
Gotta go to the bathroom...
be right back.
We're leaving!
Wait up!
Sandra's still dancing.
What's with the face?
Besides, my friend went to the bathroom...
I have to wait for him.
Then I'm leaving.
Santiago!
Why do they like that?
What?
It shouldn't be like that.
Why do they like guys... who just want them as a pastime?
What's that good for, they deserve better.
And what about guys?
They're with anybody just to kill time!
Why can't we do the same thing!
And why are you defending them?
Do you go around chasing guys all day, too?
Well, I don't.
You see.
You're not like that.
Yeah, but I don't see anything wrong with it.
If they like it, cool.
Why don't we go out tomorrow?
Sure, we'll meet at "Calle 8"
No, not there, come on... it gets tiring.
Why don't we go out by ourselves?
No.
What for?
Bye.
Elisa?
What happened?
Your brother is crazy... he beats me up every day... said he's gonna kill me next time.
You going out again?
No.
I thought you were gonna kick me out yesterday.
But you understand, right?
I know you realize.
What?
Your brother... he's like a little beast
You know what I've been thinking?
What?
Cause with your fucked up brother everything went to hell.
How come I didn't marry you?
So quiet and nice.
That's what I've been thinking... since you came back.
Don't get scared now...
What do you say?
Why are you still with him?
You should start a new life elsewhere you say yourself he's a waste, an animal why do you go on?
Where am I gonna go?
Lmagine me by myself!
So then what?
So then it's you, Santiago...
Wouldn't you like to find me here every night?
Have me here every time you get home?
Well then...
There... when you were there... do you remember how many it was... do you remember how many you killed?
You don't... you just killed, right?
If it were the same here... if you had to kill to move on... and if I asked you to... would you do it?
To always have me here?
What's your problem, buddy?
Wanna fuck up her life!
I don't get a word you're saying!
Speak up, fucker!
Besides, in those years... there were no jobs... there was terrorism... blackouts... the sure thing was military life.
And why didn't you stay?
Because of people... people in there who are totally rotten.
If you're not like them, they don't care.
They'll lock you up.
They'll kill you.
Anything can happen to you.
At the beginning you love everything... you like all that shit.
It's the best... to go out on patrol with your friends... to go out on missions... it's so much fun.
Being in the jungle... carrying your gun, your grenades... the adrenaline rush... you feel like Rambo!
Anything can happen... anything.
For example... what if you're out on patrol... and someone farts.
You're there... middle of the jungle, middle of the night... a fart.
What do you do?
It could be the enemy's, they could be next to you.
Quickly you have to smell the fart... is it Rata's?
Yogui's?
Hitler's?
And if you don't know your friends' farts you're fucked!
Cause you can locate the enemy through a fart... but they can also find you out.
And if you don't realize, you're screwed... stones start flying all over, the shooting breaks out... and people start to fall dead.
And everything for a fart.
What?
No, nothing...
I just didn't think...
What?
I mean... if you wanna be more than friends, that's okay... but maybe there's no need to rush into it.
Hey... do you still carry a gun?
You do, right?
Come on, let me see... show me your gun
Let go!
... and now we go live with Monica Castro-lglesias who's by the Commercial Bank that was robbed yesterday.
Thanks...
we're back at the location... to give you exclusive information.
The authors of the 40,000-dollar robbery might be ex-Navy Seals.
That's the hypothesis... given the initial investigations... supported mainly by witness declarations... confirming that the behavior of these robbers... wasn't that of ordinary thieves.
The investigation would have arrived at the identification... of three of the possible robbers... two of them with a history in similar crimes.
They are...
Antonio Quispe.
Known as "Farandula"...
Sandro Castro, known as "Cool mac Cool"... and Igor Merino, known as "Buitro".
The terrible thing about this information... is that it deals with people who served our country... and who would have gone from being almost heroes... to skillful criminals.
That's it for the moment...
I came to...
To what?
Yesterday I went home and you weren't there...
I thought you were gonna stay, what happened?
Come in...
He's sleeping.
I came to take you away, as you said you wanted.
Sure, sure, but come...
Wait.
You want me to talk to him?
He's drunk, Santiago... what could you say!
What are you doing?
You liked it the other day, right?
What?
You gonna tell me you're afraid of him?
Aren't you?
Didn't...
Couldn't you be a bit more dignified... and not be such a disgusting whore!
What have you been telling this guy?
Fucking bitch!
- Leave her
- No, let me go!
Let me go and listen!
Come on, tell him... do you really want me to leave you?
Let him hear it!
What's happened to you?
It's okay now.
Good morning, sir, where are you going?
Wait on the side, please.
On the streets you realize... that being here is worse than being there.
Sometimes I wish I could go back there... with everybody else... go out on patrol... on missions... and save... at least one.
I'm not going anymore.
Then let's go talk somewhere else, like you wanted.
What for?
Just to talk... you know I don't want anything else.
I got that pretty clear the other day.
Andrea... you know we get along very well...
I know you like me...
I don't know anymore.
But you always liked talking to me, right?
You always looked very comfortable.
Look... the other day... don't be scared, it's my gun.
The other day you wanted me to show you my gun, right?
Here it is.
See?
- Okay, Santiago.
- But hold it.
Hold it.
Didn't you want the gun?
Grab it... it has no bullets, you can play around with it.
No bullets, see?
Hey, what's going on!
These people, huh?
They don't realize anything, right?
You are different, do you realize?
Get back!
Everybody down!
Calm down, don't worry...
I'll save you, I'll get you out... your hands on your head!
Drop the gun!
Shut up, motherfucker!
Open the door!
Stay back, pal
Let the girl go.
Elisa, listen to me...
I've come to take you with me.
Listen to me!
If you don't come with me, he'll end up killing you.
And if he doesn't, then you will.
Coco!
Shut up!
Didn't you want me to kill him!
Have you told him to kill me now!
Let him go!
He better take off and not come back again!
He won't, but let him go!
Santiago, please, go... why does it have to be like this with you!
You never listen!
No, Santiago, please, son... forget about them... they have their lives... she'll never go with you!
Please, listen to me!
We have our own lives here... let us be.
Please, son, you have to go...
Son, please, no... you'll ruin your life!
What a business this wedding has been, what an expense.
You know, sometimes, my dear sister, I envy you your little country parsonage.
You two married for love, I know.
Now, of course, Edith can afford to do that.
Go on, Captain!
Dance!
Dance with your bride.
- You are bored, Miss Margaret.
- No.
- I'm tired.
- Oh.
I'm exhausted.
And a little too grown-up for ornaments like this.
When I get married, I want to wake up on a sunny day, put on my favorite dress and just walk to the church.
There.
There.
Is that better?
I think you look very well.
You would look very well whatever you wore.
I love my cousin dearly.
I've been very happy in this house.
But I'll be even happier to go home to Helstone.
Ah, the wonderful Helstone.
You cannot be kept away?
No.
I cannot.
It's the best place on earth.
Margaret.
Is that you?
M...
Mr. Lennox.
W... what's happened?
- Is it Edith?
Some accident?
- No, no, calm yourself.
No such calamity.
I have come to visit paradise as you suggested.
Well...
Mr. Lennox.
Y...
You'd better sit down.
This is home.
Mama, you remember Mr. Lennox?
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Yes, of course, I...
I could walk this route with my eyes closed.
I've been visiting Father's parishioners since I was a very small girl.
Did you hear what I just said?
Sorry, I...
I was just remembering your prescription for a perfect wedding.
"I should like to walk to church on a sunny morning."
Was this the path you were describing?
Why, yes, I suppose so, I... wasn't actually thinking of MY wedding, you understand.
- I was wondering, Margaret, whether...
- Please, don't won whether you might consider making that walk, sharing that morning with one who...
Please, listen.
Please.
Don't continue.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
I...
You led me to believe that such an offer would not be unwelcome.
A London girl would know not to talk of wedding days in such ambiguous terms.
Excuse me, I... said nothing I am ashamed of.
I...
I'm sorry if you have been mistaken in my affections for you.
Is there someone else, someone else you prefer?
No.
I do like you, Henry.
But I am not ready to marry anyone.
You must believe that I mean what I say.
Henry, I I
- I'm sorry.
We'll be on the streets... in a strange place.
Mama, I told you, we'll stay at a hotel until we find a house.
It won't take long.
Perhaps Dixon and I could stay on the coast while you look.
Yes... as the misses is so delicate.
No, Maria.
Your place is with us.
It will not take us long to find a house.
My old college friend, Mr. Bell, has agreed to help.
He's already organized a list of potential pupils.
There'll be plenty of teaching for me.
There will be no people there like us in Milton.
How can there be?
We will manage, Mother.
It's not another planet.
Outward, Milton!
Outward, Milton!
All change!
All change for stations north!
Why have we come here, Dixon?
It's going to be awful.
- I know it is.
- Shh.
- Outward, Milton!
- Dixon.
Take care and find a porter.
We have arrived.
All change!
I see 'im!
Porter!
Take these, please.
We'll find a house faster separately.
- Are you sure?
- Of course.
Eggs, fresh-laid eggs this mornin'!
Come and get your eggs!
Fresh fruits!
Fresh fruits!
Fruit and vegetables!
- Hello, how are you?
- All right.
- The living room's quite spacious.
- The property's not for me.
I'm enquiring on behalf of one of me master's business acquaintances.
The man is still living as a clergyman.
Or rather a former clergyman.
He's used to living simply.
He's never been a man of great property or fortune.
- A matter of conscience, I believe.
- Ah, conscience.
That never put bread on the table.
- South, eh?
- Mm-hm.
A little, er... indiscretion took place, maybe?
Well, they do say the Devil makes work for idle hands.
Maybe his hands weren't so idle.
- He'll find things a mite different up north.
- Oh, aye.
I'll make good the repairs, but the decoration's good enough.
What a business, eh?
For a man to uproot his wife and child to Milton.
Conscience or no conscience, that's strange behavior.
- Excuse me, madam, can I help you?
- My name is Margaret Hale.
Who are you?
I'm Williams, Mr. Thornton's overseer.
He asked me to look out properties for your father.
How much is the rent for the year?
Mr. Thornton will discuss it with your father.
No need to concern yourself.
I've no idea who your Mr. Thornton is.
I thank him for his trouble, but my father and I are sharing the task of securing a property.
I have spent two days viewing what Milton has to offer, so I have a fairly good idea of price.
- Mr. Thornton thinks this will do very well.
- Where is he?
- Excuse me?
- Take me to see this Mr. Thornton.
If he won't deal with me, I'll have to deal with him.
- Does Mr. Thornton live here?
- Aye, but he'll be at work.
Stay here, miss.
I'll find Master.
Stephens!
Put that pipe out!
I saw you!
Stephens!
Stephens!
Come here!
- Smoking again.
- I wasn't!
- Where is it?
- I wasn't smoking, I swear.
Still warm.
I warned you.
No!
No!
Please, sir!
- Please don't...
Please!
- You stupid... idiot!
- Please!
- Look at me!
- Look at me!
- Stop!
- Stop!
Please, stop!
- Who are you?
What are you doing in here?
- My name is Margaret Hale.
- Miss Hale!
- Sorry, sir, I told her to stay in the office.
- Get her out!
Aye, crawl away on your belly!
Please, sir...
I have little ones.
You know the rules!
- My children will starve!
- Better they starve than burn to death!
Get out before I call the police!
Get that woman out of here!
Please, miss.
Miss.
Miss, please.
Miss, please, miss...
Please!
My darling Margaret, we are back at last from our honeymoon in Corfu.
We've been away so long I'm almost fluent in Greek - or so the Captain says.
But you know, everything he says is always so agreeable.
Dear Margaret...
Now I shall say something that will make you very angry, but I can't help it.
What was Uncle thinking of, taking you all so far away from home?
Why on earth are you in that awful place where they make cotton, where no one who is anyone wishes to buy it?
I am sure we'll always wear linen.
Dear Edith, I'm pleased to report that we've replaced the horrible wallpapers with altogether more agreeable colors.
Dixon has only - if you think this possible - grown in energy.
She has set herself the task of engaging an under-maid, but as yet there isn't anyone within a radius of 50 miles who is remotely suitable to wait on us hand and foot.
I'll sit, if you don't mind
Hm.
You'll be expected to be well up before the family to light the fires.
I'm sorry, I'm not getting up at five in the morning.
And I'm not working for those wages.
I can get four shillings as a piecer at Hamper's.
Anyway, if you don't mind me asking, where's the money coming from to pay for me?
This house must be £30 a year, and there's not much coming in from what I've heard.
I'll come and go as I please!
And I don't need no bossy, jumped-up servant to tell me what's what and how to behave!
You can keep your rotten job!
Me, a servant, indeed
I don't know what the master was thinking of, subjecting us to all this gossip!
Margaret?
What's the matter?
There is some talk...
Margaret?
Margaret?
What does she mean, talk?
I did hear some people talking, when we were house-hunting.
About why we moved to Milton... so abruptly.
Why you left the church.
People are... talking?
Well, it's only natural, after all, that people should wonder.
It's not usual for clergymen to leave their parish, travel hundreds of miles, as if to escape something.
Just because we follow you without question...
It's from the bishop.
- It's not about Frederick?
- No.
I keep that letter with me always.
To reassure me that I made the right decision.
I... is this all?
"I ask that all rectors in the diocese of the New Forest
"reaffirm their belief in the Book of Common Prayer."
Exactly.
The effrontery!
The man's ten years our junior.
He tries to treat us all like children.
But this is a formality, surely... to reaffirm.
My conscience will not let me.
I can and have lived quietly with my doubts for... well, for some years now, but...
I cannot swear publicly to doctrines I am no longer sure of.
Now, we men of conscience have to make a stand.
- We?
- Yes, there are others who have doubts.
We all agreed.
We could not reaffirm.
Are you telling me that all the rectors of the New Forest have decamped to industrial towns?
Well... some thought it possible to yield, but...
I did not.
- How many?
How many refused?
- I could not avoid it.
I was forced into it.
You must understand.
I understand.
I understood... that the very worst must have happened... that you had lost your faith... or that you felt that God wished you to preach His word in these new places.
That some very great matter must have happened to make you uproot us all, dragging us up to this God-forsaken place!
- Maria.
- You gave up your livelihood our source of income on a formality.
- It was not like that, Maria.
Really.
It IS not like that.
I already have work - teaching.
And I...
I will find more.
And... and maybe I will discover that is my real vocation after all.
The people here don't want learning.
They don't want books and culture.
It's all money and smoke.
That's what they eat and breathe.
You're right, Edith.
Milton is very far from home, but it is quite an interesting and modern sort of place.
There are at least 20 mills, all very prosperous, in and around the town, and it's full of new industry of one sort or the other.
It is of course not remotely green like Helstone, and so large that I often lose my way.
But the people are friendly enough and there is nearly always someone to point me in the right direction.
'Ey up, what have we got here?
Watch out, lass!
'Scuse us!
Please.
Please...
Please don't.
Just stop.
Please... please stop.
- Leave the lass alone.
- Here y'are!
Leave the lass alone.
She shouldn't take on so.
We were only having a bit of fun.
Come on, miss.
Be careful where you walk when the whistle sounds for the break.
But don't worry, they won't harm you.
They just like a bonny face.
And yours is a picture.
Come on.
I'm...
I'm obliged to you.
Thank you, sir.
You're welcome, lass.
No charge, miss.
Get up!
Hup, hup, hup!
So this century was probably the most productive, simply in terms of the number...
Father is working hard.
He teaches students and also lectures... though some of it is unpaid and, I fear, unwanted.
- But he keeps happy.
- Thank you.
Until, erm... next Sunday.
He entertains his private pupils at home.
We have to make a choice, John.
Now, it's difficult, I know.
Margaret?
Is that you?
Margaret!
Come in, Margaret.
Come in.
Meet my new friend and first proper pupil,
Mr. Thornton.
This is my daughter, Margaret.
I believe we have already met.
Ah.
Now, Mr. Thornton can't decide between Aristotle and Plato.
I suggest we start with Plato and then move on.
What do you think?
I'm afraid we met under unpleasant circumstances.
I dismissed a worker for smoking in the sorting room.
You beat a defenseless man.
- Margaret.
- No, she's right.
I have a temper.
Fire is the greatest danger in my mill.
I have to be strict.
A gentleman would not use his fists on such a... pathetic creature or shout at children.
I dare say a gentleman has not had to see 300 corpses laid out on a hillside as I did last May.
Many were children.
And that was an accidental flame.
The whole mill destroyed in 20 minutes.
I should go.
- You'll join us for dinner next week?
- Oh, yes, of course.
Erm... thank you.
Erm... and we'll start with Plato next Tuesday.
- I'll ask my mother to call when you're settled.
- Of course, erm...
By all means.
We're always here.
Aren't we, Margaret?
I'll admit that Milton doesn't have any grand palaces or works of art, but it does have some pleasant parks where we take our daily walk and meet our friends, while the weather holds.
- Are you following' me?
- No.
Well... yes.
I didn't mean any offence.
I recognized you from Marlborough Mills.
I recognize you.
Giving Thornton back as good as he gave.
You don't see that every day.
- Well, I...
I don't want to keep you.
- What important appointments might I have
I'm going to meet my father.
He works at Hamper's, a mile across town.
- But you work at Marlborough Mills.
- Yes.
It's nearer home.
And the work's easier.
Here's Father now.
Father?
Young woman I told you about.
The day Thornton sent Stephens packing.
He deserved it.
Fool put everyone at risk.
- You're not from this part of the world, are you?
- No.
I'm from the South.
- From Hampshire.
- Mm.
Beyond London, I reckon.
Mm.
Where do you live?
We put up Frances Street, in Princeton.
Behind Golden Dragon.
And your name?
- My name is Margaret Hale.
- My name is Nicholas Higgins.
This is my daughter Bessy.
Why do you ask?
Well, I...
I thought that I might come and bring a basket.
Excuse me.
At... at home, when my father was a clergyman...
A basket?
What would we want with a basket?
We've little enough to put in it.
See, I don't much like strangers in my house.
I dare say in the South, a young lady feels she can wander into anyone's house whenever they feel like it.
Here, we wait to be asked into someone's parlor before we charge in.
Excuse me, Mr. Higgins, Bessy, I...
I didn't mean any offence.
That's why I reckon you can come if you want, but you'll not remember us.
I'll bet on that.
Margaret!
What's the matter?
Are you unwell?
It must be Mr. Thornton's mother.
Well, there's no mistaking that stern brow.
And that must be the sister.
What a deal of starch!
It would take someone all day to iron that petticoat.
Where will we put them, Mama?
I don't think the two of them will fit in here.
How exquisite.
I haven't seen English pointwork quite like that for years.
Our Milton craftsmanship can compare with the very best.
I suppose you are not musical, as I see no piano.
I am fond of music, but I cannot play well myself.
As you can see, this house would hardly bear a grand instrument.
We sold ours when we moved.
Yes, these rooms are far too small for entertaining.
Our staircases are wider than the whole width of this room.
I wonder how you can exist without a piano.
It almost seems to me a necessity of life.
- There are concerts here, I believe.
- Oh, yes.
Rather crowded.
They let in anybody.
But we have whatever is the fashion in London.
A little later, unfortunately.
- You know London, of course.
- Oh, yes.
I lived there with my aunt and cousin for a while.
Oh!
London and the Alhambra.
They are the two places I long to see.
The Alhambra?
Yes, ever since I read the "Tales of the Alhambra".
Do you know them?
Oh...
I don't... think so.
But it's a very easy journey to London and not half so far.
Yes, but...
Mama has never been to London.
She cannot understand why I long to go.
She's very proud of Milton.
Dirty, smoky place that it is.
I can't wait to leave.
May I ask why you chose to come and live in Milton?
I mean... why did you leave wherever it was?
- Helstone.
- Oh.
Well, it it-it was my husband's decision.
It was a matter of... of conscience.
But Mr. Hale is no longer a clergyman, I thought.
My husband very much enjoys his lessons with Mr. Thornton.
I think it makes him feel young again.
Classics are all very well for men who loiter life away in the country or in colleges.
But Milton men ought to have all their energies absorbed by today's work.
They should have one aim only.
Which is to maintain an honorable place amongst the merchants of this country.
Go where you will, the name of John Thornton in Milton, manufacturer and magistrate, is known and respected amongst all men of business.
And sought after by all the young women in Milton.
Not all of them, surely.
If you had a son like mine, Mrs. Hale, you would not be embarrassed to sing his praises.
If you can bear to visit our dirty, smoky home, we shall receive you next week.
Mrs. Thornton.
Well, what a splendid house!
Erm...
But, er... do you not find the proximity to the mill a little, erm well, noisy?
Never.
I've not become so fine as to forget the source of my son's power and wealth.
The mill is everything.
There is no other factory like it in Milton.
This house is my son's achievement.
Did I tell you, Thornton, about the price of raw cotton in Le Havre?
- I believe you did.
- Come on, Thornton.
Even you can spot a bargain.
Cotton's a great deal cheaper from the Caribbean.
I'll bet you Egyptian is still cheaper.
They can't offer those prices for long.
They'll be bankrupt in a year and our supply'll be interrupted.
I'd rather pay more for a steady supply through Liverpool.
We'll all lose in the end.
Thornton's as straight as they come.
He won't risk Malborough Mill, even if it means not speculating.
That's best, surely, with so many lives depending on the factory's success?
Well... that would be the Christian way.
Hear the latest over clamoring for a new wheel?
- Thought you'd agreed to it.
- I had.
First, the men threatened to turn out if I didn't install it.
It would've cost me £600.
It blows away the strands that fly off in the sorting rooms.
- Helps keeps fluff off the workers' lungs.
- So, what was the problem?
Some workers claimed they'd need more money to work with a wheel.
- What?
- Yes.
Believe me.
They heard it'd make 'em hungrier than they say they are!
- Make them hungry
- Yes.
There wouldn't be so much fluff to swallow, so their bellies'd be emptier.
Oh, yes.
So...
Oh, and this is the beautiful part.
They said I'd have to pay 'em more.
Now the men can't agree to what they want, so I've been spared £600 and the men have themselves to thank for the carding rooms being like Christmas.
Come on, Thornton.
Surely you won't approve of workers telling you what to pay 'em?
I've had a wheel in all my sheds for two years.
- More fool you.
I can't see profit in it.
- There is no immediate profit.
- Not in pounds, shillings and pence.
- But?
Well, there is a "but", in't there?
But... my workers are healthier.
Their lungs don't clog so easily.
They work for me longer.
And their children.
Even you'll see profit in that.
But surely, erm... it's the right path, also.
Sound business sense, Mr. Hale, and I cannot operate under any other moral law.
I do not run a charitable institution.
My workers expect me to be hard, but truthful.
I tell them how things are and they take it or leave it.
- Harkness tries tricks with his.
- You've got to keep them on their toes.
It's a war, and we masters have to win it or go under.
Hear, hear!
Mama, I have a letter from Edith.
Would you like me to read it to you?
She sends love from Aunt Shaw.
Your father prefers the company of Milton traders.
As if there wasn't enough to do already!
We've got no help to speak of.
I have to do everything.
It's all the master's fault.
He took leave of his senses when he brought us here.
He is not the vicar of Helstone any more.
He has thrown away his position in society and brought us all down with him.
He'll be the death of us all!
Dixon.
I know you love my mother, but you forget yourself.
Please don't talk about my father in that way.
It's not for you to question his motives or judgment.
You're a servant in this house.
Keep such thoughts to yourself, or you are free to go back to Helstone whenever you choose.
Like it or not... we are here.
I will help you.
You, Miss Margaret?
In the kitchen?
Yes.
Me.
I can learn to starch and iron, and I will until we find suitable help.
You'll do as I say, Dixon.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Bessy Higgins.
I must have come in the wrong direction.
She's along the way, round the corner.
It's all right, she's not frightened of you.
She's hungry.
That's why she cries.
Bessy's just round the corner.
Excuse me, I thought Bessy Higgins lived here.
I'm sorry I didn't come earlier.
To tell you the truth, I didn't know that I would be welcome.
I thought groceries would be offensive.
But if I had come without anything...
If there's a remote possibility of us finding offence, you can be sure we will.
We're very good at that in Milton.
I feel I've lived in Milton for quite some time now, but I still find myself constantly at fault whichever way I turn.
How long will it take for that to change?
Oh, a couple of years at least, in your case.
Sorry...
It's just I have a bit of cold I can't seem to shift.
She were right.
She said you'd come.
How was the meeting, Father?
Do not worry on my account.
I have no one to tell any secrets to.
Well, your father the parson's been seen supping with the bosses.
Mr. Thornton is his pupil.
He's certainly not my friend.
And Boucher?
He's our neighbor down the way.
He's holding up.
Just.
But he'll be with us when the fire goes up, if he knows what's good for him.
Miss, your father teaches at the Lyceum Hall, doesn't he?
Yes, he does.
Sunday afternoons.
Mother, remember I go to the Hales this evening.
I will be home to dress, but then out till late.
Dress?
Why should you dress up to take tea with an old parson?
Ex-parson
Mr. Hale is a gentleman and his daughter is an accomplished young lady.
Don't worry, Mother.
I'm in no danger from Miss Hale.
She's very unlikely to consider me a catch.
She's from the South.
She doesn't care for our Northern ways.
Airs and graces
What business has she?
A renegade clergyman's daughter, who's now only fit to play at giving useless lectures to those who do not wish to hear them.
What right has she to turn up her nose at you?
Board up the windows.
There'll be a storm later.
All motion and energy, but a thing of beauty.
The classics should be rewritten to include it.
I'm afraid we're boring Miss Hale with our enthusiasm for Arkwright.
No.
Indeed, I'm sure it's fascinating.
I'm a little tired, that's all.
Er...
Mr. Thornton has been admiring our newly redecorated rooms, Maria.
Oh.
Yes, Mr. Thornton.
Erm... well, there wasn't a great deal of choice, but these papers are of a similar shade to our drawing room in Helstone.
But not quite.
Well, on behalf of Milton taste, I'm glad we've almost passed muster.
Yes.
Yes, well... clearly, you're very proud of Milton.
My husband admires its energy and its its people are... very busy making their businesses successful.
I won't deny it.
I'd rather be toiling here, success or failure, than leading a dull, prosperous life in the South, with their slow, careless days of ease.
You are mistaken.
You don't know anything about the South.
It...
It may be a little less energetic in its pursuit of competitive trade, but there is less suffering than I have seen in your mills.
And all for what?
- We make cotton.
- Which no one wants to wear.
I think that I might say that you do not know the North.
We masters are not all the same, whatever your prejudice against Milton men.
I've seen you treat your men as you wish because they are beneath you.
No, I do not.
You've been blessed with good luck and fortune, but others have not.
I do know something of hardship.
16 years ago, my father died... in very miserable circumstances.
I became the head of the family very quickly.
I was taken out of school.
I think that I might say that my only good luck was to have a mother of such strong will and integrity.
I went to work in a draper's shop and my mother managed so that I could put three shillings aside a week.
That taught me self-denial.
Now I'm able to keep my mother in such comfort as her age requires, and I thank her every day for that early training.
So, Miss Hale, I do not think that I was especially blessed with good fortune or luck.
- I have outstayed my welcome.
- Oh, no, John.
Come, Miss Hale, let's part friends despite our differences.
If we become more familiar with each other's traditions, we may learn to be more tolerant, I think.
- I'll see myself out.
- Please.
Please come again, John.
Margaret.
The handshake is used up here in all forms of society.
I think you gave Mr. Thornton real offence by refusing to take his hand.
I'm sorry, Father.
I'm sorry I'm so slow to learn the rules of civility in Milton, but I'm tired.
I have spent the day washing curtains so that Mr. Thornton should feel at home.
So, please, excuse me if I misunderstood the handshake.
I am sure in London, a gentleman would never expect a lady to take his hand like that, all... unexpectedly.
And I didn't know where to look when he talked about his past.
His father might have died in the workhouse.
I think it might have been worse than that.
According to my friend Mr. Bell, his father speculated wildly and lost.
He, erm... he was swindled by a business partner in London.
He, erm he killed himself.
Because he couldn't bear the disgrace.
Mother and son and daughter lived on nothing for years so that the creditors could be repaid, long after they'd given up any hope of settlement.
Margaret?
I think it very fine, Father.
I am sorry to have offended your friend.
And I must go to bed.
- Put him down.
He's one of ours, isn't he?
- Boucher?
He's Thornton's.
Aren't you interested, Thornton?
All mills together, if you please.
We need to show we know what they're up to.
Let them meet, if that's how they want to spend their leisure time.
- We're all trying to work together, Thornton.
- Are we?
- What does that mean?
- I overheard some of my men talking.
It seems you're planning to give in to them.
We agreed.
We'd all be in line.
So that the men would know we meant business and know that we kept our word.
Well, I...
Father?
Well!
My, er... pupils asked if they could use the hall for... a special meeting.
Who am I to force ecclesiastical architecture on them?
Quiet!
Quiet, please!
Friends... welcome.
Now, this is the first time we have ever gathered together.
Now, don't worry, you'll all get a chance to speak, as long as we take our turn.
Now, I'm Nicholas Higgins.
I work up at Hamper's Mill.
Now, there's quite a few of us.
There's some men from Thornton's and Marlborough Mill.
Where's Henderson's?
What about Slickson's?
Now... up at Hamper's... we've got a lot of work.
Orders are flooding in, and cheap cotton to meet them.
Now, there's those of us that know that soon, bosses'll be telling us although they're making a fat profit... they can't make our pay what it were five years ago!
Now, they'll have a load of excuses.
It's all because cotton's suddenly become expensive.
This or that bit of machinery's packed up.
The buyers can't pay so there's no money to pay us!
- You've all heard it before!
- Aye, the bosses make their own rules!
Henderson says one thing, Hamper another!
Different from one week t' next!
- What's to stop 'em cutting pay again?
- Aye!
And if we quit over wages, there's more'll take our places!
Aye!
That is why we must all work together, because next time one of our bosses plays tricks, we'll all know about it.
And if we all decide on a fair wage, and none of us work for less, then for once, WE'LL have a say!
What if they don't like it, eh?
What do we do then?
What do we do then?
Boucher.
It, er... it's all right some of you talking brave.
Nicholas here earns - what?
15, 16 shilling a week?
He's only three to keep on it.
My wife's sick,
I have six children, none of them old enough for factory work.
If I turn out, we'll not be able to live on five shillings strike pay from the union.
My children... they'll starve.
Look, I'm not saying that we're coming out today.
I'm not saying that we're coming out tomorrow.
What I'm saying is... when the time comes... we will be ready.
And we will stick together!
Margaret, erm...
I know you and your mother feel I let you down.
- Father, no.
- No.
You do.
I know.
But I hope you'll realize that the people up here... they aren't so very different.
You know?
They just have different ways.
- Master.
- What are you doing here?
- I beg you to take me back...
- Get out!
I were at the meeting this evening.
I can tell you what they're planning.
- Please, sir...
- Get out!
Don't come near here again!
- Who's there?
- It's only us.
- I promise you...
- Get away from here!
- Couldn't you show a little mercy?
- Mr. Hale.
Please.
Do not try to tell me my business.
Remember, they do things differently here.
Come, Father.
I wish I could tell you, Edith, how lonely I am... how cold and harsh it is here.
Everywhere, there is conflict and... unkindness.
I think God has forsaken this place.
I believe I have seen hell and it's white.
It's snow-white.
North South (2004) .:
Episode 1 :.
What a business this wedding has been!
What an expense!
You know, sometimes, my dear sister, I envy you your little country parsonage.
You two married for love, I know.
Now, of course, Edith can afford to do that.
Go on, Captain!
Dance!
Dance with your bride.
- You are bored, Miss Margaret.
- No.
- I'm tired.
- Ah.
Oh I'm exhausted.
And a little too grown-up for ornaments like this.
When I get married, I want to wake up on a sunny day, put on my favorite dress and just walk to the church.
There.
There.
Is that better?
- I think you look very well.
- Huh.
You would look very well whatever you wore.
I love my cousin dearly.
I've been very happy in this house.
But I'll be even more happy to go home to Helstone tomorrow.
Ah, the wonderful Helstone.
You cannot be kept away?
No.
I cannot.
It's the best place on earth.
Margaret.
Is that you?
Mr-Mr.
Lennox.
W-what's happened?
- Is it Edith?
Some accident?
- No, no, no, calm yourself.
No such calamity.
I have come to visit paradise as you suggested.
Well...
Mr. Lennox.
Y-You'd better sit down.
This is home.
Mama, you remember Mr. Lennox?
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Yes, of course, I...
I could walk this route with my eyes closed.
I've been visiting Father's parishioners since I was a very small girl.
Did you hear what I just said?
Sorry, I...
I was just remembering your prescription for a perfect wedding.
"I should like to walk to church on a sunny morning?"
Was this the path you were describing?
Why, yes, I suppose so, I... wasn't actually thinking of MY wedding, you understand.
- I was wondering, Margaret, whether...
- Please, don't go on whether you might consider making that walk, sharing that morning with one who...
Please, listen.
Please.
Don't continue.
I'm sorry.
Ex-Excuse me.
I...
You led me to believe that such an offer would not be unwelcome.
A London girl would have known not to talk of wedding days in such ambiguous terms.
Excuse me, I...
said nothing I am ashamed of.
I-I'm sorry if you have been mistaken in my affections for you.
Is there someone else, someone else you prefer?
No.
I do like you, Henry.
But I am not ready to marry anyone.
You must believe that I mean what I say.
Henry, I I
- I'm sorry.
We'll be on the streets... in a strange place.
Mama, I told you, we'll stay at a hotel until we find a house.
It won't take long.
Perhaps Dixon and I could stay on the coast while you look.
Yes... as the misses is so delicate.
No, Maria.
Your place is with us.
It will not take us long to find a house.
My old college friend, Mr. Bell, has agreed to help.
He's already organized a list of potential pupils.
There'll be plenty of teaching for me.
There will be no people there like us in Milton.
How can there be?
We will manage, Mother.
It's not another planet.
Outwood, Milton!
Outwood, Milton!
All change!
All change for stations north!
Why have we come here, Dixon?
It's going to be awful.
- I know it is.
- Shh.
- Outwood, Milton!
- Dixon.
Take care and find a porter.
We have arrived.
All change!
I see 'im!
Porter!
Take these, please.
We'll find a house faster if we go separately.
- Are you sure?
- Of course.
Eggs, fresh-laid eggs this mornin'!
Come and get your eggs!
Fresh fruits!
Fresh fruits!
Fruits and vegetables!
- Hello, how are you?
- All right.
How are you?
- The living room's quite spacious, as you can see.
- The property's not for me.
I'm making inquiries on behalf of one of me master's business acquaintances.
The man is still living as a clergyman.
Or rather a former clergyman.
He's used to living simply.
I don't think he's ever been a man of great property or fortune.
- A matter of conscience, I believe.
- Ah, conscience.
That never put bread on the table.
- South, eh?
- Mm-hm.
A little, er... indiscretion took place, maybe?
Well, they do say the Devil makes work for idle hands, don't they?
Maybe his hands weren't so idle.
- Well, he'll certainly find things... quite different up north.
- Oh, aye.
Oh, aye.
Well I'll make good the repairs, but the decoration's good enough.
Hey, what a business, eh?
For a man to uproot his wife and child come all the way to Milton.
Conscience or no conscience, that's strange behavior.
- Excuse me, madam, can I help you?
- My name is Margaret Hale.
Who are you?
I'm Williams, Mr. Thornton's overseer.
He asked me to look out properties for your father.
How much is the rent for the year?
These are details Mr. Thornton will discuss with your father.
It's no need to concern yourself in money matters, ma'am.
I've no idea who your Mr. Thornton is.
I thank him for his trouble, but my father and I are sharing the task of securing a property.
I have spent two days viewing what Milton has to offer, so I have a fairly good idea of price.
- Mr. Thornton thinks this will do very well for your father.
- Where is Mr. Thornton?
- Excuse me?
- Take me to see this Mr. Thornton.
If he won't deal with me, I'll have to deal with him.
- Does Mr. Thornton live here?
- Aye, but he'll be at work.
Stay here, Miss.
I'll find Master.
Stephens!
Put that pipe out!
I saw you!
Stephens!
Stephens!
Come here!
- Smoking again.
- I wasn't!
- Where is it?
- I wasn't smoking, I swear.
Still warm.
I warned you.
No!
No!
Please, sir!
- Please don't...
Please!
- You stupid idiot!
- Please!
- Look at me!
- Look at me!
- Stop!
- Stop!
Please, stop!
- Who are you?
What are you doing in here?
- My name is Margaret Hale.
- Miss Hale!
- I'm sorry, sir, I told her to stay in the office.
- Get her out of here!
Aye, crawl away on your belly and don't come back!
Please, sir...
I have little ones.
- Stop!
- You know the rules!
- My children will starve, sir!
- Better they starve than burn to death!
Get out before I call the police!
Get that woman out of here!
Please, Miss.
Miss.
Miss, please.
Miss, please, Miss...
Please!
My darling Margaret, we are back at last from our honeymoon in Corfu.
We've been away so long I'm almost fluent in Greek - or so the Captain says.
But you know, everything he says is always so agreeable.
Oh, dear Margaret...
Now I'm going to say something that will make you very angry, but I can't help it.
What was uncle thinking of taking you all so far away from home?
Why on earth are you in that awful place where they make cotton, when no one who is anyone wishes to buy it?
I am sure we'll always wear linen.
Dear Edith, I'm pleased to report that we've replaced the horrible wallpapers with altogether more agreeable colors.
Dixon has only - if you think this possible - grown in energy.
She has set herself the task of engaging an under-maid, but as yet there isn't anyone within a radius of at least 50 miles who is remotely suitable to wait on us hand and foot.
I'll sit, if you don't mind.
Hm.
You'll be expected to be well up before the family to light the fires.
I'm sorry, I'm not getting up at five in the morning.
And I'm not working for those wages.
I can get four shillings as a piecer at Hamper's.
Anyway, if you don't mind me asking, where's the money coming from to pay for me?
This house must be costing 30 pound a year, and there's not much coming in from what I've heard.
I'll come and go as I please!
And I don't need no bossy, jumped-up servant to tell me what's what and how to behave!
You can keep your rotten job!
Me, a servant, indeed
I don't know what the master was thinking of, subjecting us to all this gossip!
Margaret?
What's the matter?
There is some talk...
Margaret?
Margaret?
What does she mean "talk"?
I did hear some people talking, when we were house-hunting.
About why we moved to Milton... so abruptly.
Why you left the church.
People are... talking?
Well, it's only natural, after all, that people should wonder.
It's not usual for clergymen to leave their parish, travel hundreds of miles, as if to escape something.
Just because we follow you without question...
It's from the bishop.
- It's not about Frederick?
- No, no, no.
I keep that letter with me at all times.
To reassure me that I made the right decision.
I-Is this all?
"I ask that all rectors in the diocese of the New Forest reaffirm their belief in the Book of Common Prayer."
Yes, there!
Exactly.
The effrontery!
The man's ten years our junior.
He tries to treat us all like children.
But this is a formality, surely... to reaffirm.
My conscience will not let me.
I can and have lived quietly with my doubts for... well, for some years now, but...
I cannot swear publicly to doctrines I am no longer sure of.
Now, we men of conscience have to make a stand.
- We?
- Yes, there are others who have doubts.
We all agreed.
We could not reaffirm.
Are you telling me that all the rectors of the New Forest have decamped to industrial towns?
Well... some thought it possible to yield, but...
I did not.
- How many?
How many refused?
- I could not avoid it.
I was forced into it.
You must understand.
I understand.
I understood... that the very worst must have happened... that you had lost your faith... or that you felt that God wished you to preach His word in these new places.
That some very great matter must have happened to make you uproot us all, dragging us up to this God-forsaken place!
- Maria.
- You gave up your livelihood our source of income on a formality.
- It was not like that, Maria.
Really.
It is not like that.
I already have work - teaching.
And I-I will find more.
And... maybe I will discover that is my real vocation after all.
The people here don't want learning.
They don't want books and culture.
It's all money and smoke.
That's what they eat and breathe.
And you're right, Edith.
Milton is very far from home, but it is quite an interesting and modern sort of place.
There are at least 20 mills, all very prosperous, in and around the town, and it's full of new industry of one sort or the other.
It is of course not remotely green like Helstone, and so large that I often lose my way.
But the people are friendly enough and there is nearly always someone to point me in the right direction.
'Ey up, what have we got here?
Watch out, lass!
'Scuse us!
Please.
Please...
Please don't.
Just stop.
Please... please stop.
- Is this yours?
- Here y'are!
Leave the lass alone.
She shouldn't take on so.
We were only having a bit of fun.
Come on, Miss.
Be careful where you walk when the whistle sounds for the break.
But don't worry, they won't harm you.
They just like a bonny face.
And yours is a picture.
Come on.
I'm...
I'm obliged to you.
Thank you, sir.
You're welcome, lass.
No charge, Miss.
Get up!
Hup, hup, hup!
So this century was probably the most productive, simply in terms of the number of...
Father is working hard.
He teaches students and also lectures... though some of it is unpaid and, I fear, unwanted.
But he keeps happy.
- Thank you.
Until, erm... next Sunday.
He entertains his private pupils at home.
We have to make a choice, John.
Now, it's difficult, I know.
Margaret?
Is that you?
Well, Margaret!
Come in, Margaret.
Come in.
Meet my new friend and, erm, first proper pupil,
Mr. Thornton.
This is my daughter, Margaret.
I believe your daughter and I have already met.
Ah...
Now, Mr. Thornton can't decide between Aristotle and Plato.
I suggest we start with Plato and then move on.
What do you think?
I'm afraid Miss Hale and I met under less than pleasant circumstances.
I had to dismiss a worker for smoking in the sorting room.
I saw you beat a defenseless man who's not your equal.
- Margaret.
- No, she's right.
I was angry.
I have a temper.
Fire is the greatest danger in my mill.
I have to be strict.
A gentleman would not use his fists on such a... pathetic creature or shout at children.
I dare say a gentleman has not had to see 300 corpses laid out on Yorkshire hillside as I did last May.
And many of them were children.
And that was an accidental flame.
The whole mill destroyed in 20 minutes.
I should go.
- You'll join us for dinner next week?
- Oh, yes, of course.
Erm... thank you.
Erm... and we'll start with Plato next Tuesday.
- I will ask my mother to call when you're settled.
- Of course, erm...
Not by all means.
We're always here.
Aren't we, Margaret?
I'll admit that Milton doesn't have any grand palaces or works of art, but it does have some pleasant parks where we take our daily walk and meet our friends, while the weather holds.
- Are you following' me?
- No.
Well... yes.
I didn't mean any offense.
I recognized you from Marlborough Mills.
I recognize you.
Giving Thornton back as good as he gave.
You don't see that every day.
- Well, I-I don't want to keep you.
- What important appointments might I have?
I'm going to meet my father.
He works at Hamper's, a mile across town.
- But you work at Marlborough Mills.
- Yes.
It's nearer home.
And the work's easier.
Here's Father now.
Father?
Young woman I told you about.
The day Thornton beat Stephens sent him packing.
He deserved it.
The fool put everyone at risk.
- You're not from this part of the world, are you?
- No.
I'm from the South.
- From Hampshire.
- Mm.
That's beyond London, I reckon.
Mm.
Where do you live?
We put up Frances Street, in Princeton.
Behind Golden Dragon.
And your name?
- My name is Margaret Hale.
- My name is Nicholas Higgins.
This is my daughter Bessy Higgins.
Why do you ask?
Well, I-I thought that I might come and bring a basket.
Excuse me.
At... at home, when my father was a clergyman, of course...
A basket?
What would we want with a basket?
We've little enough to put in it.
See, I don't much like strangers in my house.
I dare say in the South where you come from, a young lady such yourself feels she can wander into anyone's house whenever they feel like it.
But up here, we wait to be asked into someone's parlour before we go charging in.
Excuse me, Mr. Higgins, Bessy, I...
I didn't mean any offense.
That's why I reckon you can come if you want, but you'll not remember us.
I'll bet on that.
Margaret!
What's the matter?
Are you unwell?
It must be Mr. Thornton's mother.
Well, there's no mistaking that stern brow.
And that must be the sister.
What a deal of starch!
It would take someone all day to iron that petticoat.
Where will we put them, Mama?
I don't think the two of them will fit in here.
H-How exquisite.
I haven't seen English pointwork quite like that for years.
Our Milton craftsmanship can compare with the very best.
I suppose you are not musical, as I see no piano.
I am fond of music, but I cannot play well myself.
As you can see, this house would hardly bear a grand instrument.
We sold ours when we moved.
Yes, these rooms are far too small for entertaining.
Our staircases are wider than the whole width of this room.
I wonder how you can exist without a piano.
It almost seems to me a necessity of life.
- There are concerts here, I believe.
- Oh, yes.
Rather crowded.
They let in anybody.
But we have whatever is the fashion in London.
A little later, unfortunately.
- You know London, of course.
- Oh, yes.
I lived there with my aunt and cousin for a while.
Oh!
London and the Alhambra.
They are the two places I long to see.
The Alhambra?
Yes, ever since I read the "Tales of the Alhambra".
Do you know them?
Oh...
I don't... think so.
But it's a very easy journey to London and not half so far.
Yes, but...
Mama has never been to London.
She cannot understand why I long to go.
She's very proud of Milton.
Dirty, smoky place that it is.
I can't wait to leave.
May I ask why you chose to come and live in Milton?
I mean... why did you leave wherever it was?
- Helstone.
- Oh.
Well, it it-it was my husband's decision.
It was a matter of... of conscience.
But Mr. Hale is no longer a clergyman, I thought.
My husband very much enjoys his lessons with Mr. Thornton.
I think it makes him feel young again.
Classics are all very well for men who loiter their life away in the country or in colleges.
But Milton men ought to have all their energies absorbed by today's work.
They should have one aim only.
Which is to hold and maintain an honorable place amongst the merchants of this country.
Go where you will, the name of John Thornton in Milton, manufacturer and magistrate, is known and respected amongst all men of business.
And sought after by all the young women in Milton.
Not all of them, surely.
If you had a son like mine, Mrs. Hale, you would not be embarrassed to sing his praises.
If you can bear to visit our dirty, smoky home, we shall receive you next week.
Mrs. Thornton.
Well, what a splendid house!
Erm...
But, er... do you not find the proximity to the mill a little, erm well, noisy?
Never.
I've not become so fine as to forget the source of my son's power and wealth.
The mill is everything.
There is no other factory like it in Milton.
This house is my son's achievement.
Did I tell you, Thornton, about the price of raw cotton in Le Havre?
- I believe you did.
- Come on, Thornton.
Even you can spot a bargain when you see it.
Cotton's a great deal cheaper from the Caribbean than from America.
Nonsense.
I bet you Egyptian cotton is still cheaper.
I don't believe they can't offer those prices for long.
They'll be bankrupt in a year and we'll have our supply interrupted.
I'd rather pay more for a steady supply through Liverpool.
The others can do as they wish, we'll all lose in the end.
Thornton's as straight as they come.
He won't risk Marlborough Mill in any risky enterprise, even if it means passing up the chance to speculate.
But that's the best way surely, with so many lives depending on the factory's continued success?
Well, erm... that would be the Christian way.
By the way, everyone.
Hear the latest over clamoring for a new wheel?
- Thought you'd agreed to the wheel?
- Yeah, well I had.
First the men threatened to turn out if I didn't install the infernal wheel.
Yeah, which would've cost me 600 pound.
The wheel blows away the strands of cotton that flies off in the sorting rooms.
It helps keep the fluff off the workers lungs.
It doesn't stop it, but it does help.
So, what was the problem?
Well, some of the workers started claiming they'd need more money to work in a place with a wheel.
- What?
- Yes.
Believe me.
- They'd heard it'd make 'em hungrier,
- Yeah.
And even hungrier than they claim they always are!
- The wheel would make them hungry?
- Yes, I swear!
Some of them said that if I put the wheel in, there wouldn't be so much fluff to swallow, so their bellies'd be emptier.
Oh, yes.
So...
Oh, and this is the beautiful part... they were saying I'd have to pay 'em more.
And now the men are split amongst themselves and can't agree to what they want.
So, I've been spared 600 pound.
And the men have only themselves to thank for the carding rooms being like Christmas every day with all that sneezing.
Oh come on, Thornton.
Surely you won't approve of your workers telling you what to pay 'em?
I've had a wheel in all my sheds in this past two years.
- Oh, more fool you.
I can't see profit in it.
- There is no immediate profit.
- None that you can count in pounds, shillings and pence.
- But?
Well, there is a "but", in't there?
But... my workers are healthier.
Their lungs don't clog so easily.
They work for me longer.
And their children work for me longer.
Even you can see profit in that.
But surely, erm... it's the right path, also.
Sound business sense, Mr. Hale, and I cannot operate under any other moral law.
I do not run a charitable institution.
My workers expect me to be hard, but truthful.
I always tell them how things are and they either take it or they leave it.
- Harkness's always tryin' little tricks with his workers.
- You've got to keep them on their toes.
It's a war, and we masters have to win it or go under.
Hear, hear!
Mama, I have a letter from Edith.
Would you like me to read it to you?
She sends love from Aunt Shaw.
I wonder that your father prefers the company of Milton tradesmen.
As if there wasn't enough to do already!
We've got no help to speak of.
I have to do everything.
It's all the master's fault.
He took leave of his senses when he brought us here.
He is not the vicar of Helstone any more.
He has thrown away his position in society and brought us all down with him.
He'll be the death of us all!
Dixon.
I know you love my mother, but you forget yourself.
Please don't talk about my father in that way.
It's not for you to question his motives or judgment.
You're a servant in this house.
If you have such thoughts, keep them to yourself, or you are free to leave and go back to Helstone whenever you choose.
Like it or not...
we are here.
I will help you.
You, Miss Margaret?
In the kitchen?
Yes.
Me.
I can learn to starch and iron, and I will until we find suitable help.
You'll do as I say, Dixon.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Bessy Higgins.
I must have come in the wrong direction.
She lives along the way, just round the corner.
It's all right, she's not frightened of you.
She's hungry.
That's why she cries.
Bessy's just round the corner.
Excuse me, I thought Bessy Higgins lived here.
I'm sorry I didn't come earlier.
To tell you the truth, I didn't know that I would be welcome.
I thought the groceries would be offensive.
But if I had come without anything...
If there's a remote possibility of us finding offense, you can be sure we will.
We're very good at that in Milton.
I feel I've lived in Milton for quite some time now, but I still find myself constantly at fault whichever way I turn.
How long will it take for that to change?
Oh, a couple of years at least, in your case.
Sorry...
It's just I have a bit of cold, I can't seem to shift.
She were right.
She said you'd come.
How was the meeting, Father?
Oh.
Do not worry on my account.
I have no one to tell any secrets to.
Well, your father the parson's been seen supping with the bosses.
Mr. Thornton is his pupil.
He's certainly not my friend.
And Boucher?
He's our neighbor down the way.
He's holding up.
Just.
But he'll be with us when the fire goes up right enough, if he knows what's good for him.
Miss Margaret, your father teaches at the Lyceum Hall, doesn't he?
Yes, he does.
Sunday afternoons.
Mother, remember I go to the Hales this evening.
I will be home to dress, but then out till late.
Dress?
Why should you dress up to take tea with an old parson?
Ex-parson!
Mr. Hale is a gentleman and his daughter is an accomplished young lady.
Don't worry, Mother.
I'm in no danger from Miss Hale.
She's very unlikely to consider me a catch.
She's from the South.
She doesn't care for our Northern ways.
Huh!
Airs and graces!
What business has she?
A renegade clergyman's daughter, who's now only fit to play at giving useless lectures to those who do not wish to hear them.
What right has she to turn up her nose at you?
Board up the windows.
There'll be a storm later.
All motion and energy but truly a thing of beauty.
Classics will have to be rewritten to include it.
Ah...
I'm afraid we're boring Miss Hale with our enthusiasm for Arkwright's invention.
No.
Indeed, I'm sure it's fascinating.
I'm a little tired, that's all.
Er...
Mr. Thornton has been admiring our newly redecorated rooms, Maria.
Oh.
Yes, Mr. Thornton.
Hmm... well, there...
there wasn't a great deal of choice, but these papers are of a similar shade to our drawing room in Helstone.
But not quite.
Well, on behalf of Milton taste, I'm glad we've almost passed muster.
Yes.
Yes, well... clearly, you're very proud of Milton.
My husband admires its energy and its its people are... very busy making their businesses successful.
I won't deny it.
I'd rather be toiling here, success or failure, than leading a dull, prosperous life in the South...
with their slow, careless days of ease.
You are mistaken.
You don't know anything about the South.
It...
It may be a little less energetic in its pursuit of competitive trade, but then there is less suffering than I have seen in your mills....
And all for what?
- We make cotton.
- Which no one wants to wear.
I think that I might say that you do not know the North.
We masters are not all the same whatever your prejudice against Milton men and their ways.
I've seen the way you treat your men.
You treat them as you wish because they are beneath you.
No, I do not.
You've been blessed with good luck and fortune, but others have not.
I do know something of hardship.
16 years ago, my father died... in very miserable circumstances.
I became the head of the family very quickly.
I was taken out of school.
I think that I might say that my only good luck was to have a mother of such strong will and integrity.
I went to work in a draper's shop and my mother managed so that I could put three shillings aside a week.
That taught me self-denial.
Now I'm able to keep my mother in such comfort as her age requires, and I thank her every day, for that early training.
So, Miss Hale, I do not think that I was especially blessed with... good fortune or luck.
- I have outstayed my welcome.
- Oh, no, John.
Come, Miss Hale, let's part friends despite our differences.
If we become more familiar with each other's traditions, we may learn to be more tolerant, I think.
- I'll see myself out.
- Please, please come again, John.
Margaret.
The handshake is used up here in all forms of society.
I think you gave Mr. Thornton real offense by refusing to take his hand.
I'm sorry, Father.
I'm sorry I'm so slow to learn the rules of civility in Milton, but I am tired.
I have spent the whole day washing curtains so that Mr. Thornton should feel at home.
So, please, excuse me if I misunderstood the handshake.
I am sure in London, a gentleman would never expect a lady to take his hand like that, ...all unexpectedly.
And I'm sure I didn't know where to look when he talked about his past.
His father might have died in the workhouse!
I think it might have been worse than that.
According to my friend Mr. Bell, his father speculated wildly, and lost.
He, erm... he was swindled by a business partner in London.
He, erm he killed himself.
Because he couldn't bear the disgrace.
Mother, and son and daughter lived on nothing for years, so that the creditors could be repaid long after they had given up any hope of settlement.
Margaret?
I think it very fine, Father.
I am sorry to have offended your friend.
And I must go to bed.
- Ah, put him down.
He's one of ours, isn't he?
- Boucher?
He's Thornton's.
Aren't you interested, Thornton?
All mills together, if you please.
We need to show 'em.
We know what they're up to and who they are.
Let them meet, if that's how they want to spend their leisure time.
- We're all trying to work together, Thornton.
- Are we?
- What does that mean?
- I overheard some of my men talking.
It seems you're planning to give in to them.
We agreed.
We'd all be in line.
So that the men would know we meant business and know that we kept our word.
Well, I...
Father?
My, er... pupils asked me if they could use the Hall for... special meeting.
Who am I to force ecclesiastical architecture on them?
Quiet!
Quiet, please!
Friends,...
Welcome.
Now this is the first time, we have ever gathered together!
Now don't worry, we'll all get a chance to speak as long as we take our turn.
Now, I'm Nicholas Higgins.
I work up at Hamper's Mill.
Now there's quite a few of us.
...and some men from Thornton's at Marlborough Mill.
Where's Henderson's?
What about Slickson's?
Now...
Up at Hamper's... we've got a lot of work.
The orders are flooding in, and cheap cotton to meet them.
Now, there's those of us that know...
that soon... bosses'll be telling us although they are making a fat profit, they can't make our pay what it were five years ago!
They'll have a load of excuses.
It's all because cotton's suddenly become expensive.
This or that bit of machinery's packed up.
The buyers can't pay so there's no money to pay us!
- You've all heard it before!
- Aye, the bosses make their own rules!
Henderson says one thing, Hampers another!
Different from one week t'next!
- But what's to stop them cutting pay again, eh?
- Aye, aye, aye...
And if we quit over wages, there's more'll take our places!
Aye!
That is why we must all work together, because next time one of our bosses plays tricks, we'll all know about it.
And if we all decide on a fair wage and none of us, none of us work for less, then for once, WE'LL have a say!
What if bosses don't like it, eh?
What do we do then?
What do we do then?
Boucher.
It's ah... it's all right some of you talking brave.
Nicholas here earns what?
15, 16 shillings in a week?
He's only three to keep on it.
My wife's sick,
I have six children, none of them old enough for factory work.
If I turn out, we'll not be able to live on five shillings strike pay from Union.
My children... they'll starve.
Look, I'm not saying... that we're coming out today.
I'm not saying that we're coming out tomorrow.
What I'm saying is... when the time comes... we will be ready.
And we will stick together!
Margaret, erm...
I know you and your mother feel I let you down.
- Father, no.
- No.
You do.
I know.
But I hope you realize that the people up here... they aren't so very different.
You know?
They just have different ways.
- Master.
- What are you doing here?
- I beg you to take me back...
- Get out!
I were at the meeting this evening.
I could tell you what they're planning...
what's in their thoughts...
- Please, sir.
I beg you...
- Get out!
Don't come near here again!
- Who's there?
- It's only us.
- I promise you...
- Get away from here!
- Couldn't you show a little mercy?
- Mr. Hale.
Please...
Do not try to tell me my business.
Remember, they do things differently here!
Come, Father.
I wish I could tell you, Edith, how lonely I am... how cold and harsh it is here.
Everywhere, there is conflict and... unkindness.
I think God has forsaken this place.
I believe I have seen hell and it's white.
It's snow-white.
What a business this wedding has been, what an expense.
You know, sometimes, my dear sister, I envy you your little country parsonage.
You two married for love, I know.
Now, of course, Edith can afford to do that.
Go on, Captain!
Dance!
Dance with your bride.
- You are bored, Miss Margaret.
- No.
- I'm tired.
- Oh.
I'm exhausted.
And a little too grown-up for ornaments like this.
When I get married, I want to wake up on a sunny day, put on my favorite dress and just walk to the church.
There.
There.
Is that better?
I think you look very well.
You would look very well whatever you wore.
I love my cousin dearly.
I've been very happy in this house.
But I'll be even happier to go home to Helstone.
Ah, the wonderful Helstone.
You cannot be kept away?
No.
I cannot.
It's the best place on earth.
Margaret.
Is that you?
M...
Mr. Lennox.
W... what's happened?
- Is it Edith?
Some accident?
- No, no, calm yourself.
No such calamity.
I have come to visit paradise as you suggested.
Well...
Mr. Lennox.
Y...
You'd better sit down.
This is home.
Mama, you remember Mr. Lennox?
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Yes, of course, I...
I could walk this route with my eyes closed.
I've been visiting Father's parishioners since I was a very small girl.
Did you hear what I just said?
Sorry, I...
I was just remembering your prescription for a perfect wedding.
"I should like to walk to church on a sunny morning."
Was this the path you were describing?
Why, yes, I suppose so, I... wasn't actually thinking of MY wedding, you understand.
- I was wondering, Margaret, whether...
- Please, don't won whether you might consider making that walk,
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
I...
You led me to believe that such an offer would not be unwelcome.
A London girl would know not to talk of wedding days in such ambiguous terms.
Excuse me, I... said nothing I am ashamed of.
I...
I'm sorry if you have been mistaken in my affections for you.
Is there someone else, someone else you prefer?
No.
I do like you, Henry.
But I am not ready to marry anyone.
You must believe that I mean what I say.
Henry, I I
- I'm sorry.
We'll be on the streets... in a strange place.
Mama, I told you, we'll stay at a hotel until we find a house.
It won't take long.
Perhaps Dixon and I could stay on the coast while you look.
Yes... as the misses is so delicate.
No, Maria.
Your place is with us.
It will not take us long to find a house.
My old college friend, Mr. Bell, has agreed to help.
He's already organized a list of potential pupils.
There'll be plenty of teaching for me.
There will be no people there like us in Milton.
How can there be?
We will manage, Mother.
It's not another planet.
Outward, Milton!
Outward, Milton!
All change!
All change for stations north!
Why have we come here, Dixon?
It's going to be awful.
- I know it is.
- Shh.
- Outward, Milton!
- Dixon.
Take care and find a porter.
We have arrived.
All change!
I see 'im!
Porter!
Take these, please.
We'll find a house faster separately.
- Are you sure?
- Of course.
Eggs, fresh-laid eggs this mornin'!
Come and get your eggs!
Fresh fruits!
Fresh fruits!
Fruit and vegetables!
- Hello, how are you?
- All right.
- The living room's quite spacious.
- The property's not for me.
I'm enquiring on behalf of one of me master's business acquaintances.
The man is still living as a clergyman.
Or rather a former clergyman.
He's used to living simply.
He's never been a man of great property or fortune.
- A matter of conscience, I believe.
- Ah, conscience.
That never put bread on the table.
- South, eh?
- Mm-hm.
A little, er... indiscretion took place, maybe?
Well, they do say the Devil makes work for idle hands.
Maybe his hands weren't so idle.
- He'll find things a mite different up north.
- Oh, aye.
I'll make good the repairs, but the decoration's good enough.
What a business, eh?
For a man to uproot his wife and child to Milton.
Conscience or no conscience, that's strange behavior.
- Excuse me, madam, can I help you?
- My name is Margaret Hale.
Who are you?
I'm Williams, Mr. Thornton's overseer.
He asked me to look out properties for your father.
How much is the rent for the year?
Mr. Thornton will discuss it with your father.
No need to concern yourself.
I've no idea who your Mr. Thornton is.
I thank him for his trouble, but my father and I are sharing the task of securing a property.
I have spent two days viewing what Milton has to offer, so I have a fairly good idea of price.
- Mr. Thornton thinks this will do very well.
- Where is he?
- Excuse me?
- Take me to see this Mr. Thornton.
If he won't deal with me, I'll have to deal with him.
- Does Mr. Thornton live here?
- Aye, but he'll be at work.
Stay here, miss.
I'll find Master.
Stephens!
Put that pipe out!
I saw you!
Stephens!
Stephens!
Come here!
- Smoking again.
- I wasn't!
- Where is it?
- I wasn't smoking, I swear.
Still warm.
I warned you.
No!
No!
Please, sir!
- Please don't...
Please!
- You stupid... idiot!
- Please!
- Look at me!
- Look at me!
- Stop!
- Stop!
Please, stop!
- Who are you?
What are you doing in here?
- My name is Margaret Hale.
- Miss Hale!
- Sorry, sir, I told her to stay in the office.
- Get her out!
Aye, crawl away on your belly!
Please, sir...
I have little ones.
You know the rules!
- My children will starve!
- Better they starve than burn to death!
Get out before I call the police!
Get that woman out of here!
Please, miss.
Miss.
Miss, please.
Miss, please, miss...
Please!
My darling Margaret, we are back at last from our honeymoon in Corfu.
We've been away so long I'm almost fluent in Greek - or so the Captain says.
But you know, everything he says is always so agreeable.
Dear Margaret...
Now I shall say something that will make you very angry, but I can't help it.
What was Uncle thinking of, taking you all so far away from home?
Why on earth are you in that awful place where they make cotton, where no one who is anyone wishes to buy it?
I am sure we'll always wear linen.
Dear Edith, I'm pleased to report that we've replaced the horrible wallpapers with altogether more agreeable colors.
Dixon has only - if you think this possible - grown in energy.
She has set herself the task of engaging an under-maid, but as yet there isn't anyone within a radius of 50 miles who is remotely suitable to wait on us hand and foot.
I'll sit, if you don't mind
Hm.
You'll be expected to be well up before the family to light the fires.
I'm sorry, I'm not getting up at five in the morning.
And I'm not working for those wages.
I can get four shillings as a piecer at Hamper's.
Anyway, if you don't mind me asking, where's the money coming from to pay for me?
This house must be �30 a year, and there's not much coming in from what I've heard.
I'll come and go as I please!
And I don't need no bossy, jumped-up servant to tell me what's what and how to behave!
You can keep your rotten job!
Me, a servant, indeed
I don't know what the master was thinking of, subjecting us to all this gossip!
Margaret?
What's the matter?
There is some talk...
Margaret?
Margaret?
What does she mean, talk?
I did hear some people talking, when we were house-hunting.
About why we moved to Milton... so abruptly.
Why you left the church.
People are... talking?
Well, it's only natural, after all, that people should wonder.
It's not usual for clergymen to leave their parish, travel hundreds of miles, as if to escape something.
Just because we follow you without question...
It's from the bishop.
- It's not about Frederick?
- No.
I keep that letter with me always.
To reassure me that I made the right decision.
I... is this all?
"I ask that all rectors in the diocese of the New Forest
"reaffirm their belief in the Book of Common Prayer."
Exactly.
The effrontery!
The man's ten years our junior.
He tries to treat us all like children.
But this is a formality, surely... to reaffirm.
My conscience will not let me.
I can and have lived quietly with my doubts for... well, for some years now, but...
I cannot swear publicly to doctrines I am no longer sure of.
Now, we men of conscience have to make a stand.
- We?
- Yes, there are others who have doubts.
We all agreed.
We could not reaffirm.
Are you telling me that all the rectors of the New Forest have decamped to industrial towns?
Well... some thought it possible to yield, but...
I did not.
- How many?
How many refused?
- I could not avoid it.
I was forced into it.
You must understand.
I understand.
I understood... that the very worst must have happened... that you had lost your faith... or that you felt that God wished you to preach His word in these new places.
That some very great matter must have happened to make you uproot us all, dragging us up to this God-forsaken place!
- Maria.
- You gave up your livelihood our source of income on a formality.
- It was not like that, Maria.
Really.
It IS not like that.
I already have work - teaching.
And I...
I will find more.
And... and maybe I will discover that is my real vocation after all.
The people here don't want learning.
They don't want books and culture.
It's all money and smoke.
That's what they eat and breathe.
You're right, Edith.
Milton is very far from home, but it is quite an interesting and modern sort of place.
There are at least 20 mills, all very prosperous, in and around the town, and it's full of new industry of one sort or the other.
It is of course not remotely green like Helstone, and so large that I often lose my way.
But the people are friendly enough and there is nearly always someone to point me in the right direction.
'Ey up, what have we got here?
Watch out, lass!
'Scuse us!
Please.
Please...
Please don't.
Just stop.
Please... please stop.
- Leave the lass alone.
- Here y'are!
Leave the lass alone.
She shouldn't take on so.
We were only having a bit of fun.
Come on, miss.
Be careful where you walk when the whistle sounds for the break.
But don't worry, they won't harm you.
They just like a bonny face.
And yours is a picture.
Come on.
I'm...
I'm obliged to you.
Thank you, sir.
You're welcome, lass.
No charge, miss.
Get up!
Hup, hup, hup!
So this century was probably the most productive, simply in terms of the number...
Father is working hard.
He teaches students and also lectures... though some of it is unpaid and, I fear, unwanted.
- But he keeps happy.
- Thank you.
Until, erm... next Sunday.
He entertains his private pupils at home.
We have to make a choice, John.
Now, it's difficult, I know.
Margaret?
Is that you?
Margaret!
Come in, Margaret.
Come in.
Meet my new friend and first proper pupil,
Mr. Thornton.
This is my daughter, Margaret.
I believe we have already met.
Ah.
Now, Mr. Thornton can't decide between Aristotle and Plato.
I suggest we start with Plato and then move on.
What do you think?
I'm afraid we met under unpleasant circumstances.
I dismissed a worker for smoking in the sorting room.
You beat a defenseless man.
- Margaret.
- No, she's right.
I have a temper.
Fire is the greatest danger in my mill.
I have to be strict.
A gentleman would not use his fists on such a... pathetic creature or shout at children.
I dare say a gentleman has not had to see 300 corpses laid out on a hillside as I did last May.
Many were children.
And that was an accidental flame.
The whole mill destroyed in 20 minutes.
I should go.
- You'll join us for dinner next week?
- Oh, yes, of course.
Erm... thank you.
Erm... and we'll start with Plato next Tuesday.
- I'll ask my mother to call when you're settled.
- Of course, erm...
By all means.
We're always here.
Aren't we, Margaret?
I'll admit that Milton doesn't have any grand palaces or works of art, but it does have some pleasant parks where we take our daily walk and meet our friends, while the weather holds.
- Are you following' me?
- No.
Well... yes.
I didn't mean any offence.
I recognized you from Marlborough Mills.
I recognize you.
Giving Thornton back as good as he gave.
You don't see that every day.
- Well, I...
I don't want to keep you.
- What important appointments might I have
I'm going to meet my father.
He works at Hamper's, a mile across town.
- But you work at Marlborough Mills.
- Yes.
It's nearer home.
And the work's easier.
Here's Father now.
Father?
Young woman I told you about.
The day Thornton sent Stephens packing.
He deserved it.
Fool put everyone at risk.
- You're not from this part of the world, are you?
- No.
I'm from the South.
- From Hampshire.
- Mm.
Beyond London, I reckon.
Mm.
Where do you live?
We put up Frances Street, in Princeton.
Behind Golden Dragon.
And your name?
- My name is Margaret Hale.
- My name is Nicholas Higgins.
This is my daughter Bessy.
Why do you ask?
Well, I...
I thought that I might come and bring a basket.
Excuse me.
At... at home, when my father was a clergyman...
A basket?
What would we want with a basket?
We've little enough to put in it.
See, I don't much like strangers in my house.
I dare say in the South, a young lady feels she can wander into anyone's house whenever they feel like it.
Here, we wait to be asked into someone's parlor before we charge in.
Excuse me, Mr. Higgins, Bessy, I...
I didn't mean any offence.
That's why I reckon you can come if you want, but you'll not remember us.
I'll bet on that.
Margaret!
What's the matter?
Are you unwell?
It must be Mr. Thornton's mother.
Well, there's no mistaking that stern brow.
And that must be the sister.
What a deal of starch!
It would take someone all day to iron that petticoat.
Where will we put them, Mama?
I don't think the two of them will fit in here.
How exquisite.
I haven't seen English pointwork quite like that for years.
Our Milton craftsmanship can compare with the very best.
I suppose you are not musical, as I see no piano.
I am fond of music, but I cannot play well myself.
As you can see, this house would hardly bear a grand instrument.
We sold ours when we moved.
Yes, these rooms are far too small for entertaining.
Our staircases are wider than the whole width of this room.
I wonder how you can exist without a piano.
It almost seems to me a necessity of life.
- There are concerts here, I believe.
- Oh, yes.
Rather crowded.
They let in anybody.
But we have whatever is the fashion in London.
A little later, unfortunately.
- You know London, of course.
- Oh, yes.
I lived there with my aunt and cousin for a while.
Oh!
London and the Alhambra.
They are the two places I long to see.
The Alhambra?
Yes, ever since I read the "Tales of the Alhambra".
Do you know them?
Oh...
I don't... think so.
But it's a very easy journey to London and not half so far.
Yes, but...
Mama has never been to London.
She cannot understand why I long to go.
She's very proud of Milton.
Dirty, smoky place that it is.
I can't wait to leave.
May I ask why you chose to come and live in Milton?
I mean... why did you leave wherever it was?
- Helstone.
- Oh.
Well, it it-it was my husband's decision.
It was a matter of... of conscience.
But Mr. Hale is no longer a clergyman, I thought.
My husband very much enjoys his lessons with Mr. Thornton.
I think it makes him feel young again.
Classics are all very well for men who loiter life away in the country or in colleges.
But Milton men ought to have all their energies absorbed by today's work.
They should have one aim only.
Which is to maintain an honorable place amongst the merchants of this country.
Go where you will, the name of John Thornton in Milton, manufacturer and magistrate, is known and respected amongst all men of business.
And sought after by all the young women in Milton.
Not all of them, surely.
If you had a son like mine, Mrs. Hale, you would not be embarrassed to sing his praises.
If you can bear to visit our dirty, smoky home, we shall receive you next week.
Mrs. Thornton.
Well, what a splendid house!
Erm...
But, er... do you not find the proximity to the mill a little, erm well, noisy?
Never.
I've not become so fine as to forget the source of my son's power and wealth.
The mill is everything.
There is no other factory like it in Milton.
This house is my son's achievement.
Did I tell you, Thornton, about the price of raw cotton in Le Havre?
- I believe you did.
- Come on, Thornton.
Even you can spot a bargain.
Cotton's a great deal cheaper from the Caribbean.
I'll bet you Egyptian is still cheaper.
They can't offer those prices for long.
They'll be bankrupt in a year and our supply'll be interrupted.
I'd rather pay more for a steady supply through Liverpool.
We'll all lose in the end.
Thornton's as straight as they come.
He won't risk Malborough Mill, even if it means not speculating.
That's best, surely, with so many lives depending on the factory's success?
Well... that would be the Christian way.
Hear the latest over clamoring for a new wheel?
- Thought you'd agreed to it.
- I had.
First, the men threatened to turn out if I didn't install it.
It would've cost me �600.
It blows away the strands that fly off in the sorting rooms.
- Helps keeps fluff off the workers' lungs.
- So, what was the problem?
Some workers claimed they'd need more money to work with a wheel.
- What?
- Yes.
Believe me.
They heard it'd make 'em hungrier than they say they are!
- Make them hungry
- Yes.
There wouldn't be so much fluff to swallow, so their bellies'd be emptier.
Oh, yes.
So...
Oh, and this is the beautiful part.
They said I'd have to pay 'em more.
Now the men can't agree to what they want, so I've been spared �600 and the men have themselves to thank for the carding rooms being like Christmas.
Come on, Thornton.
Surely you won't approve of workers telling you what to pay 'em?
I've had a wheel in all my sheds for two years.
- More fool you.
I can't see profit in it.
- There is no immediate profit.
- Not in pounds, shillings and pence.
- But?
Well, there is a "but", in't there?
But... my workers are healthier.
Their lungs don't clog so easily.
They work for me longer.
And their children.
Even you'll see profit in that.
But surely, erm... it's the right path, also.
Sound business sense, Mr. Hale, and I cannot operate under any other moral law.
I do not run a charitable institution.
My workers expect me to be hard, but truthful.
I tell them how things are and they take it or leave it.
- Harkness tries tricks with his.
- You've got to keep them on their toes.
It's a war, and we masters have to win it or go under.
Hear, hear!
Mama, I have a letter from Edith.
Would you like me to read it to you?
She sends love from Aunt Shaw.
Your father prefers the company of Milton traders.
As if there wasn't enough to do already!
We've got no help to speak of.
I have to do everything.
It's all the master's fault.
He took leave of his senses when he brought us here.
He is not the vicar of Helstone any more.
He has thrown away his position in society and brought us all down with him.
He'll be the death of us all!
Dixon.
I know you love my mother, but you forget yourself.
Please don't talk about my father in that way.
It's not for you to question his motives or judgment.
You're a servant in this house.
Keep such thoughts to yourself, or you are free to go back to Helstone whenever you choose.
Like it or not... we are here.
I will help you.
You, Miss Margaret?
In the kitchen?
Yes.
Me.
I can learn to starch and iron, and I will until we find suitable help.
You'll do as I say, Dixon.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Bessy Higgins.
I must have come in the wrong direction.
She's along the way, round the corner.
It's all right, she's not frightened of you.
She's hungry.
That's why she cries.
Bessy's just round the corner.
Excuse me, I thought Bessy Higgins lived here.
I'm sorry I didn't come earlier.
To tell you the truth, I didn't know that I would be welcome.
I thought groceries would be offensive.
But if I had come without anything...
If there's a remote possibility of us finding offence, you can be sure we will.
We're very good at that in Milton.
I feel I've lived in Milton for quite some time now, but I still find myself constantly at fault whichever way I turn.
How long will it take for that to change?
Oh, a couple of years at least, in your case.
Sorry...
It's just I have a bit of cold I can't seem to shift.
She were right.
She said you'd come.
How was the meeting, Father?
Do not worry on my account.
I have no one to tell any secrets to.
Well, your father the parson's been seen supping with the bosses.
Mr. Thornton is his pupil.
He's certainly not my friend.
And Boucher?
He's our neighbor down the way.
He's holding up.
Just.
But he'll be with us when the fire goes up, if he knows what's good for him.
Miss, your father teaches at the Lyceum Hall, doesn't he?
Yes, he does.
Sunday afternoons.
Mother, remember I go to the Hales this evening.
I will be home to dress, but then out till late.
Dress?
Why should you dress up to take tea with an old parson?
Ex-parson
Mr. Hale is a gentleman and his daughter is an accomplished young lady.
Don't worry, Mother.
I'm in no danger from Miss Hale.
She's very unlikely to consider me a catch.
She's from the South.
She doesn't care for our Northern ways.
Airs and graces
What business has she?
A renegade clergyman's daughter, who's now only fit to play at giving useless lectures to those who do not wish to hear them.
What right has she to turn up her nose at you?
Board up the windows.
There'll be a storm later.
All motion and energy, but a thing of beauty.
The classics should be rewritten to include it.
I'm afraid we're boring Miss Hale with our enthusiasm for Arkwright.
No.
Indeed, I'm sure it's fascinating.
I'm a little tired, that's all.
Er...
Mr. Thornton has been admiring our newly redecorated rooms, Maria.
Oh.
Yes, Mr. Thornton.
Erm... well, there wasn't a great deal of choice, but these papers are of a similar shade to our drawing room in Helstone.
But not quite.
Well, on behalf of Milton taste, I'm glad we've almost passed muster.
Yes.
Yes, well... clearly, you're very proud of Milton.
My husband admires its energy and its its people are... very busy making their businesses successful.
I won't deny it.
I'd rather be toiling here, success or failure, than leading a dull, prosperous life in the South, with their slow, careless days of ease.
You are mistaken.
You don't know anything about the South.
It...
It may be a little less energetic in its pursuit of competitive trade, but there is less suffering than I have seen in your mills.
And all for what?
- We make cotton.
- Which no one wants to wear.
I think that I might say that you do not know the North.
We masters are not all the same, whatever your prejudice against Milton men.
I've seen you treat your men as you wish because they are beneath you.
No, I do not.
You've been blessed with good luck and fortune, but others have not.
I do know something of hardship.
16 years ago, my father died... in very miserable circumstances.
I became the head of the family very quickly.
I was taken out of school.
I think that I might say that my only good luck was to have a mother of such strong will and integrity.
I went to work in a draper's shop and my mother managed so that I could put three shillings aside a week.
That taught me self-denial.
Now I'm able to keep my mother in such comfort as her age requires, and I thank her every day for that early training.
So, Miss Hale, I do not think that I was especially blessed with good fortune or luck.
- I have outstayed my welcome.
- Oh, no, John.
Come, Miss Hale, let's part friends despite our differences.
If we become more familiar with each other's traditions, we may learn to be more tolerant, I think.
- I'll see myself out.
- Please.
Please come again, John.
Margaret.
The handshake is used up here in all forms of society.
I think you gave Mr. Thornton real offence by refusing to take his hand.
I'm sorry, Father.
I'm sorry I'm so slow to learn the rules of civility in Milton, but I'm tired.
I have spent the day washing curtains so that Mr. Thornton should feel at home.
So, please, excuse me if I misunderstood the handshake.
I am sure in London, a gentleman would never expect a lady to take his hand like that, all... unexpectedly.
And I didn't know where to look when he talked about his past.
His father might have died in the workhouse.
I think it might have been worse than that.
According to my friend Mr. Bell, his father speculated wildly and lost.
He, erm... he was swindled by a business partner in London.
He, erm he killed himself.
Because he couldn't bear the disgrace.
Mother and son and daughter lived on nothing for years so that the creditors could be repaid, long after they'd given up any hope of settlement.
Margaret?
I think it very fine, Father.
I am sorry to have offended your friend.
And I must go to bed.
- Put him down.
He's one of ours, isn't he?
- Boucher?
He's Thornton's.
Aren't you interested, Thornton?
All mills together, if you please.
We need to show we know what they're up to.
Let them meet, if that's how they want to spend their leisure time.
- We're all trying to work together, Thornton.
- Are we?
- What does that mean?
- I overheard some of my men talking.
It seems you're planning to give in to them.
We agreed.
We'd all be in line.
So that the men would know we meant business and know that we kept our word.
Well, I...
Father?
Well!
My, er... pupils asked if they could use the hall for... a special meeting.
Who am I to force ecclesiastical architecture on them?
Quiet!
Quiet, please!
Friends... welcome.
Now, this is the first time we have ever gathered together.
Now, don't worry, you'll all get a chance to speak, as long as we take our turn.
Now, I'm Nicholas Higgins.
I work up at Hamper's Mill.
Now, there's quite a few of us.
There's some men from Thornton's and Marlborough Mill.
Where's Henderson's?
What about Slickson's?
Now... up at Hamper's... we've got a lot of work.
Orders are flooding in, and cheap cotton to meet them.
Now, there's those of us that know that soon, bosses'll be telling us although they're making a fat profit... they can't make our pay what it were five years ago!
Now, they'll have a load of excuses.
It's all because cotton's suddenly become expensive.
This or that bit of machinery's packed up.
The buyers can't pay so there's no money to pay us!
- You've all heard it before!
- Aye, the bosses make their own rules!
Henderson says one thing, Hamper another!
Different from one week t' next!
- What's to stop 'em cutting pay again?
- Aye!
And if we quit over wages, there's more'll take our places!
Aye!
That is why we must all work together, because next time one of our bosses plays tricks, we'll all know about it.
And if we all decide on a fair wage, and none of us work for less, then for once, WE'LL have a say!
What if they don't like it, eh?
What do we do then?
What do we do then?
Boucher.
It, er... it's all right some of you talking brave.
Nicholas here earns - what?
15, 16 shilling a week?
He's only three to keep on it.
My wife's sick,
I have six children, none of them old enough for factory work.
If I turn out, we'll not be able to live on five shillings strike pay from the union.
My children... they'll starve.
Look, I'm not saying that we're coming out today.
I'm not saying that we're coming out tomorrow.
What I'm saying is... when the time comes... we will be ready.
And we will stick together!
Margaret, erm...
I know you and your mother feel I let you down.
- Father, no.
- No.
You do.
I know.
But I hope you'll realize that the people up here... they aren't so very different.
You know?
They just have different ways.
- Master.
- What are you doing here?
- I beg you to take me back...
- Get out!
I were at the meeting this evening.
I can tell you what they're planning.
- Please, sir...
- Get out!
Don't come near here again!
- Who's there?
- It's only us.
- I promise you...
- Get away from here!
- Couldn't you show a little mercy?
- Mr. Hale.
Please.
Do not try to tell me my business.
Remember, they do things differently here.
Come, Father.
I wish I could tell you, Edith, how lonely I am... how cold and harsh it is here.
Everywhere, there is conflict and... unkindness.
I think God has forsaken this place.
I believe I have seen hell and it's white.
It's snow-white.
The MALS CAMlNHO LONG
For a long time, talked about traveling together.
Maybe to Spain or somewhere like that.
And suddenly, Ewan called me one night...
Saying: "Instead of Spain, why not travel the world?"
Will travel 32,000 km and will cross 13 countries.
We could continue eastward, directly by Russia...
But we want to see Kazakhstan and Mongolia.
And walk the Road of Bones in far eastern Russia until Magadan.
We'll fly to Alaska...
Will travel across Canada, U.S. and New York.
It will be the longest motorcycle trip I've done .
Do not be a simple ride a motorcycle.
Does a bit more than that.
PREVIOUSLY...
When they came to talk to me about the project, I thought they were crazy.
RUSS Malkin, PRODUCER
David Alexanian, PRODUCER
We're just preparing ourselves for any eventuality.
We are talking about big extensions do not populated...
Where people sent as punishment believing that they never return more...
There There are more bears than humans.
If you get stuck here, will be the end of the trip.
The time is approaching.
Time is running out.
We do not have bikes.
Tested the BMWs and was very impressed with them.
Is the only bike made for this sort of thing.
Ewan prefer BMW, but I think I can convince him.
I think will be the KTM.
I was very happy.
A 6 WEEKS OF DEPARTURE
Bad news.
I received a call from KTM in the morning...
K in KTM, Mr. Any-who-is-your-name.
- Do not want to give the bikes?
- Correct.
I asked what made them change their minds .
He said: "Thomas returned yesterday's meeting... saying it was concerned with parts of Siberia."
That's ridiculous.
He ​​even made the trip.
I think he never traveled Road of Bones.
Do you know how he came to Yakutz?
Devil came in a boat.
My God!
I do not understand.
For God's sake!
What Thomas said this?
What was not possible to make the trip?
I knew.
My first reaction was not to bring the guy here.
I said this to everyone.
Would not it be right to bring him here.
Unfortunately, this was the condition.
EWAN calls the KTM
Hello, this is Ewan McGregor.
Charley and I are here a little shocked...
About why KTM has withdrawn all offers.
I really want to know why.
I think it would be nice if we linking back.
Right.
Thank you.
- I do not know if I hung up.
- Now gone.
Why is that?
Shut up.
My first reaction was to blow it.
We are a lot of people spoiled and greedy.
I thought in all things we expect.
They offered us bikes for free.
Who else gets bikes for free?
You can not ask a bike for free, but we did it.
THE PHONE WITH THE EXECUTIVE KTM
Because of what details?
After all, is an adventure.
The idea is that depart on an adventure.
Right.
Well, thanks for your time have .
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Do you think we can fail.
We with BMW and show them...
I'll get rid of it.
Fail.
How dare you say that?
I was very impressed with Ewan.
It would have been happy to opt for the BMW since the beginning...
But supported me and believed in my passion for KTM.
It is not fair.
For you, it's just a nightmare.
I think he accepted the KTM a little for me.
I feel honored just because he had thought of doing something.
I am happy to have chosen the BMW.
These bikes are made to rotate the world.
A 5 WEEKS OF DEPARTURE
We are training in Wales.
The first day on the bikes will be lighter, get used to driving off-road.
On the second day, the bikes will be larger and heavier.
Once the bike starts, transfer your weight to the outside.
Just as there is.
In theory, it is a great idea go around the world motorcycle.
But the reality is that we off-road driving for much of the trip.
It's a bike huge and heavy.
I have never done this before.
I fell a lot and I'm not ashamed to admit it .
I think it was very difficult for Ewan.
I was doing things he never did before .
He always went on the road.
For me it was easier.
LATER THE SAME NIGHT
Ewan went perfectly well, five kilometers per hour.
But even on a track...
I need to learn not to let her shake me up and down.
Soon after that nasty fall...
I saw in Siberia, unable to walk the Road of Bones...
Disappointed at all.
I need to stop letting things discouraged me.
Well I fell...
And immediately thought that would ruin the trip for Charley.
DAY 2 :
IN MOTORCYCLE TRAINING CC 1150
I did not sleep well.
But you can give a Ewan the chance to recover.
Will return to train off-road, but in the bigger bikes .
I hope not to knock them both today because...
Are too heavy to lift.
Pronto.
Now.
Place the knee down.
Pull yourself...
Upward.
NICK, TRAINER OF OFF-ROAD
We will continue to watch it.
It's getting better.
You get used to.
SIMON, TRAINER OF OFF-ROAD
That 'will happen.
Now you need to do it right.
Perfect.
I let affect me.
I was afraid of falling, being the guy that falls all the time.
Yesterday was like a jolt...
Because I had never done this before.
The reality of what we do I nailed it.
- Will be difficult.
- Are you worried about something?
No.
Not really.
Seriously.
No problem with Charley.
He does not open with me.
He ​​should be worried about something.
What is not great.
It is he who raises my bike, raises my morale.
Charley is so.
But it opened my eyes to what we have to make the trip.
Will go through Kazakhstan and Mongolia.
- On the map is easy.
- 500 km there and 250 here.
Would be an average of 400, 500 km per day.
Once arrived in Siberia and flew to Anchorage...
How language comes easy.
Do not think it will be a problem.
Tell the truth.
Jure.
Do you have any concerns about the trip?
I have no problem with what we are doing.
No.
- That is good.
- See, it's Ewan.
Lmbecil.
Think about what we did in Wales...
And that most of the time, which as will be made there.
Represents my pulse.
As the eye grows.
Do not know if imagine what we will find ahead.
Seems that this trip has two parts.
It Siberia, and then that part of Alaska to New York.
In my mind, is this:
Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Siberia are clearer...
Since they may be more challenging than the rest...
But who knows?
Perhaps the greatest challenge is to guide on a 3 lane road in the U.S....
Surrounded by trucks and hamburgers.
Perhaps a bigger challenge...
To take the bike for another mud puddle Road of Bones.
Three chocolates lined up.
Someone pooped.
I smell.
- Ewan?
- No.
I was here with you.
I was just checking.
I would enter.
I'm going.
I was going to poop and take the magazine MCN...
To be able to look at me and Ewan in the picture, but...
Look.
Ready?
- It's amazing.
- I Want to do it again?
- Is an optical illusion?
- Llusão optics.
Look.
I did it for money.
No, you have to and then put it.
- Put your chocolate.
- Place on the table, kid.
I'm impressed!
- I think it's here.
- In my hood?
- In his hood.
- Chocolate in the hood.
Damn it.
I heard the BMWs are so reliable that never spoil.
Then, learn how to fix them will be waste of time.
I hope so, but we disassemble them and reassemble them again.
- What is it?
- It's a very boring subject.
That's a pot of throttle position.
Lnforma to the control unit that is the throttle angle.
- I said it was boring!
- No, it's fascinating.
All nuts are tight.
The force is strong in this one.
Drugs.
Do you think we need to put it back?
It will not fit , because I smashed a lot.
Ewan is sanding everything.
Fits perfectly.
I'm putting the grease here...
He told me to do this.
I do not care anymore.
- For to do this?
- I have no idea.
He told me to do.
I asked why and he said that's part of BMW.
Said that we are using donkeys, which is the only thing we can do.
I, sumo wrestler big one.
I, ready to fight with everyone.
In large workshop from BMW, we have important task to do.
Great.
Can give us the straws with the ball?
Ewan is a possible candidate for the role of Bond.
James Bond.
Personally, I think I would be a great Bond .
Nobody talks to me.
- You could be...
- I could be M.
You could be the Moneypenny!
Imagine that!
You've made my secretary before.
Can do it again.
Never will work with that idiot again.
A 3 THREE WEEKS OF DEPARTURE interviewed 20 people, but still could not find the cameraman.
But the equipment began to arrive.
Do not!
Wow!
It's ridiculous.
It's like Christmas.
- Charley, look!
- "Changed Charley Boorman."
It's a nice machine.
Beeps when you reach a certain torque.
It's a digital torque wrench.
Do not know how I go so long without one.
Adapters adjustable.
Always helpful.
I have always admired these very things.
Use of these a butane soldering irons.
This is the Gucci...
And no end.
I'm thrilled.
We have a box full of tools!
It was something I always wanted, since a child .
I always wanted a box of tools .
A red box, with "Snap-On" written on it.
Not only have the red box with "Snap-On" written...
But also "specially modified Charley Boorman."
The bikes come in half an hour.
Then cancel the Russian class.
Damn!
Already smashed my!
The 15 days of departure...
And Charley changed the concept housekeeping in the workplace.
- No, Charley?
- What?
What?
- Have you heard of the organization?
- Not finished!
Swear I'm relieved...
Because we finally opted for BMWs.
Every inch of my body knows it is the right bike.
I swear to God.
Oh, for God's sake!
Patience.
Patience, you know?
Rome was not built in a day.
That's a male fantasy.
Friends and Snap-On.
Repair my bike with a box of plastic tools...
I bought in a hardware store five, ten years, for 30 pounds.
Sonic will come with the cameras to show us how they work...
So we'll see what happens.
It takes an hour and a half to prepare the after riding the bike.
Come in, Charley.
We are flying at 35 000 feet.
Pousaremos in Acapulco in 25 minutes.
- I hope you enjoy the flight.
Tell.
- Whatever.
- Well, is not it?
- Amazing, is not it?
The fact that the bikes and tools have reached made it more real.
That's cool.
It's all good.
Part of me wants to go now.
The other part is not.
The idea of ​​leaving my wife and daughters for so long...
It will be difficult.
EVE, WIFE OF EWAN
They will not the tourist places such as Thailand or Vietnam.
Go to places that nobody wants to visit.
Who goes on holiday to Kazakhstan?
I'm worried about bears and who knows what.
Another concern is what happens to a relationship...
When someone experiences what they will experience.
"Travels with Charley," starring Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman.
- Hi
- Here we are in the damn woods.
Pick up the fungus in the bag and the devil's penis.
Ukraine will go through maybe a week.
Where are my glasses?
I will do laser surgery tomorrow.
- Really?
What's eyes?
- I can not see very well.
MARK, FRIEND OF EWAN
- Works?
- I hope so!
I will say, "Wow!
I can see you over the phone!"
- Have you ever suffered from view?
- Yes, but this eye is worse now.
- Yes, I'm having problems.
- Worse by far.
Look .
Grunge London.
Urban.
But then as well. "Well .."
He thought to guide the world 32,000 km, helmet...
Would be a great problem to have to put glasses through the helmet.
So he decided to do laser surgery...
Which is nice because it will give you a vision 20 by 20...
And make your life easier.
From the point of view of production, brings a certain uncertainty ...
Because you are not sure if it will work .
Connect when you get home and are well.
- But do not delay.
- No, I'm calling.
- Are you nervous?
- Yes They cut the eyeball.
Arise a piece and apply the laser.
And you're awake the whole time.
My God!
They keep their eyes open with tweezers , things like that.
A 2 WEEKS OF DEPARTURE
View 20 for 12.
That best two 20 by 20.
My name is Ewan "I can see For Always" McGregor.
You felt something strange?
To make the cut in the top the eye, they form a flap.
Are cut to the full extent, as the top of an egg...
But not cut to the end.
For this he uses an instrument round over his eye...
And puts too much pressure on him, which gives a strange feeling.
Your brain says, "Do not let him do pressure in your eye."
It's a bit like "Clockwork Orange", but not during the operation.
The time is coming, then we have define route to get the visa...
Otherwise, we are in trouble.
Ldiota.
It is the birthplace of Genghis Khan .
So are 45.
E 46 "back in the USSR."
Then we will have three weeks in the USSR.
It seems to me...
It does not seem very diverse.
We will miss this part.
Here, I can say, "Charley, I see you in a week." You will...
And sleep alone in the tent?
You must be joking.
It's good for Scotland.
I got the boots, socks...
Come to Scotland to test the bikes and equipment.
And I want to see my parents.
The bikes are very comfortable.
Do not windy.
Are heated.
It's easy guide them and all the equipment worked well.
Coordination of bikes and everything else was great.
Ewan is excited to be home.
It is vibrating.
It's pretty funny to see that.
I was a waiter here.
He was a waiter at the hotel just to see .
That's funny.
It's great to be here.
Finally 'll see where his parents live, after all these years.
I grew up here.
This is his mother, looking very cheerful.
- What do you think of the trip?
- I do not know what to think.
CAROL MOTHER OF EWAN MCGREGOR
As a mother, prefer to stay at home.
But it is very exciting, I know he will love , and you too.
And as parent , you can not stop them from doing what they want.
Can not, right?
- This is a little something for you.
- Is it?
Basically, for her birthday.
I know it's early, but I I needed to win it now.
Gifts.
Thank you.
It's a beautiful book.
Thank you.
It's beautiful.
It is a lovely mother.
His father was in hospital.
Did replacement surgery for hips, then went to see him.
He was in great shape.
He ​​told funny stories.
Jim McGregor FATHER OF EWAN
A guy said: "Ewan McGregor will around the world in one of those."
I had my helmet.
Charley said...
"Stuart, Ewan McGregor will get around the world on a bike like this."
I said, "Go?
Who knew!"
This is my grandmother Lawson.
Look.
79.
Will walk to work every days.
- Before I retire.
- E. ..
I will not ask.
- It's rude to ask.
- No problem.
I'm 81.
- 81?
My God!
You are fantastic.
- You are fantastic.
I feel good.
PHYLLIS, GRANDMOTHER OF EWAN not to risk in any way.
- Where are we, Ewan?
- In Glencoe, Charley.
It's one of my favorite shares of Scotland.
Glencoe.
See also the colors.
- It's beautiful.
- I want that house.
We camp tonight in this climate.
I'm trying to convince Ewan that should not, but hear me.
It will work.
It is the first time that Charley and I reassemble a camp.
- Ready.
- We set up the tent.
I'm more organized than you.
I did not bring the pots.
Did you bring the pots?
Yes, I brought.
Camping will be a problem.
Why camp if you can stay in a hotel?
All camping equipment works.
It's been good as a test.
It worked.
The last four days are are important.
We learned a lot.
- Can you see me?
- Yes, my friend.
His eyes seem very strange.
I want to eat it and kill it.
We are officially in the bush.
Have you print?
Yes, I think...
There is something to be said about hotels and things like .
I am suffering from an obsession.
Agreement night and I think that room...
Or in one piece, or Charley, or bike, or this or that.
Once my mind awake, only think about these things.
I am finding it very difficult to concentrate on other things.
When I'm home, far from it, try to focus...
As soon we are dealing only with those things.
It's hard.
Olly gets a little frustrated with me sometimes...
That I hear, but sometimes without listening.
My mind wanders to another subject, and one thing or another.
I think she understands, but feels frustrated .
I am very excited about his trip, but 15 weeks is a long time.
OLLY , WIFE OF CHARLEY
We're going to miss him, especially children .
It's a long time.
ZIGGY PUPPY CHARLEY
Olly's trying not to think about it.
If you think, cry.
But she's great.
Says: "You'll be back in three months .
Face it."
I go around the world motorcycle.
What do you think of my trip?
Doone, DAUGHTER OF CHARLEY
Animated.
DAUGHTER CHARLEY Kinvara
And worried.
It's sad.
Lreland I went to visit my father last time before leaving.
This was his first bike.
Must be about 25 years.
You had the bike at age twelve.
I saw here, with five children on the same bike.
FATHER JOHN CHARLEY Boorman
I realized that it is totally irresponsible.
MOTHER AND SISTERS OF CHARLEY MALIBU, CALIFORNIA, 1972
CRYSTAL MOTHER OF CHARLEY Boorman
Have you ever sucked the finger as well.
It was a very sweet child.
And now going to Siberia.
You're crazy.
Months ago look for a camera operator who can guide a bike...
Filming, directing, who we like and who got along well.
It was not working with some with whom we work.
We were lucky when we saw the curriculum a cameraman Franc...
Which is perfect for our project.
CLAUDlO VON PLANT OPERATOR CAMERA
He is adorable.
Seems to understand that it is.
And you know what's interesting?
He ​​gave one back on the bike.
Came back, went straight and said:
"Yes, it's great."
I'll download it now.
Thank you.
The one week, we found that cameraman has no portfolio.
I found that my wallet Swiss is not recognized in the UK...
Which means I'll have to make another license test.
I'm pretty confident.
I think it will work.
He will take the test on Tuesday.
We left on Wednesday morning.
If he fails, you can not go.
And there's nobody else.
We discovered another problem.
The passport Claudio has no room for all visas...
Then we have to ask another passport to be issued in Switzerland...
And shipped back here before leaving.
All will get the new passport if I give the old man.
So we have to send it to Switzerland.
We have three things.
Ace nine, you go to the embassy...
Try to add documents to the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
But at twelve, the documents will or not delivered by courier.
If not, you go after them.
Is being tracked.
Do not disappeared.
There are a number of reference air.
At the moment, both passports are there, ready, Switzerland.
My mother offered to bring them to fly to London...
To ensure they arrive in time, because these courier services...
All this global adventure depends on the mother of Claudio.
What if...
There is the British Foreign Office.
The Swiss have a similar service to help travelers abroad?
- I spent a month in prison...
- Wait a minute!
Stop!
I spent a month in jail in Pakistan.
I called Swiss embassy and explained the problem...
Pakistanis were causing problems.
They kept me prisoner.
It took a month to Switzerland me out of there.
The third part is when you do your test , at 15h27...
To see if you can steer the bike.
Claudio is the only guy that will ride around the world motorcycle... a driver's license or passport.
They love him for being calm.
But there quiet and calm.
- What is it?
- One thing for deer.
Maybe Border think they are rocket launchers.
Do not say anything about the bike.
Or it will run or be attracted to him.
Or will be paralyzed, thinking:
"What the hell is that noise?"
You appears on the curve and they...
- It's called Deer Freezer.
- I will not take it.
It's a grass.
Four guys traveling the world in 4x4s that have not yet arrived.
Do not we spend a full day, half day much less...
Without thinking what will them.
We have a list.
All that is highlighted in yellow...
Represents things that we do not.
- I have nine shorts.
- Nine?
!
Are gray, because they were white, you would see dirt easily.
Let's see when you put the underwear inside out the next day.
That's why we brought nine, it at least once every nine days...
So I can use them for two months...
Front, back...
Upside down front and back.
- An underwear, four days.
- When you have used all four sides...
Perhaps the first stain has dried, and you can start all over again.
This is what will feed them the next three and a half months.
We spend so much time preparing for the bikes and they all...
But not spend much time part of preparing the camera.
But the big guys Mitsubishi contributed some cars.
The L200 will do anything.
With Shogun, will feel more comfortable.
Will do whatever they need.
What about vehicles?
The story with Mitsubishi is fantastic.
Persuaded two guys to go to Germany...
Buy stuff they need, go back at once...
And 24 hours, we have prepared the two Mitsubishi .
A 3 DAYS OF DEPARTURE 4:15 a.m. and we need it until 14h00.
We are trying to fix everything that is necessary before departure.
Suddenly, we find with the problem of Russian visas.
We visas for all staff, for all countries...
- Except for Russia.
- 90% of the trip will be made in Russia.
Drugs.
There is nothing more important that the documents .
Only documents.
Do not think it should be stressed... 's Too early for something to happen.
If it happens, will be a miracle.
The official date of arrival visas is the first 6 days.
Do not wanna be boring, but we're trying to go around the world...
And just got here.
- Need to melt it.
- I know.
Are you a technical consultant?
Do you offer a little help...
Do not try this at home when full of gasoline.
- With what you filled?
- Fuel camping.
- Who finished first?
- I bought mine without fuel.
Again, Ewan can put the blame on someone else.
Beautiful, man.
CENTER OF QUALIFICATION TESTS
On the evening before departure...
In the department's license, make my big bike test.
It's very close to the starting...
But I hope that I can.
AN HOUR LATER
- what happened?
- I'm sorry.
It's a bummer.
- Is ridiculous.
- Are you serious?
- Are you kidding me.
- I'm not.
I'm saying, I'm not.
You're kidding.
Do not tell me that.
No, I'm saying...
I failed.
A 12 HOURS OF DEPARTURE
LEAGUE FOR DAVID EWAN
Claudio failed the test.
Can you believe it?
Ldiotas, idiots.
It's so annoying!
No errors.
The only mistake is that I did not look far behind.
- The only mistake.
- Three changes of direction.
- When you can do next?
- Within ten working days.
- No more vague.
- You're kidding.
Already scored.
The earliest date was 30.
You're too cool.
I expected the door in my face.
"Exit.
We do not want to see you anymore."
- Will wait for this option.
- You're right.
I'm pretty cool.
How's your mother?
It is on the way, right?
My mother is reliable.
Not like me.
You can count on my mother.
She know how to drive a motorcycle?
ARRIVAL OF SUPPORT VEHICLES
The 10 HOURS OF DEPARTURE
- I'm a little sick.
- I do too.
I felt good in my heart.
It was awful this morning.
Was very difficult trying to act normally.
I woke up at 12:30 last night and could not go back to sleep.
I started to panic.
12.30.
Just like that.
Margrit von PLANT MOTHER OF CLAUDIO
- only deliver to VLPs.
- It's perfect.
A 7 HOURS OF DEPARTURE
Let's mark to 12.30.
Four cans of gasoline in each bracket.
Two sets of tires, water there, and everything else that does not interest me.
That 'and this is for the stove.
Do not know what to put here!
Phone Numbers, copies of passport and visa cards, visa.
Permission borders.
That's the most important.
It says that you can use any fuel.
Petrol, paraffin...?
I do not know!
A 5 HOUR TRIP
dishes.
We have dishes.
Dishes.
Try to remember that.
This is exactly what we need.
07H00 TO START
Yesterday was hell.
We're here until 04.00.
- I think you're all set.
- Headache.
But we decided everything.
I'm doing a final check, so do not distract me .
Finally decided to Russia.
Visas arrive on Friday.
We are preparing the communication.
Walkie-talkies, satellite phones.
When you get lost in the desert, can call and ask for help.
The alarm did not wake me.
I am trying to prepare everything.
Everything is under control.
MICHELIN EUROPE
We need this European map, do not need, Ewan?
- It is.
- I have no where to take it.
I want to go now.
- Beware of the dog.
- I can not see the dog.
DAISY twin sister CHARLEY
It is good to do different things.
I'm excited about his departure...
Because he will see how other people live...
But I'm sad that he's going, because not see you for three and a half months.
It is a long time.
I think it's pretty scary.
I do not like my daughters to appear on TV...
And my wife wanted to stay with them, because are a little upset.
So we said goodbye at home.
We would not have gotten here without you, so thank you to all .
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
We did everything.
We just need to take care of some documents.
But we have seen people carrying passports and plane.
We have two motorcycles, two cars and also a cake .
- What more could you want?
- Good luck, mate.
Promised to take care of Ewan.
I love you too, Mom.
We have to stop at the corner to fill the tanks.
You may wonder:
"It was not...?"
- Are you going?
- I do not want to go?
Call me anytime.
I love you baby.
Give me a kiss.
I love you.
Saying goodbye to his wife and daughters , then go...
I saw my wife and daughters crying the corner of my eye.
I was devastated, and therefore dropped the bike.
Can anyone help?
Thank you.
Jesus!
GOOD LUCK.
HOW BUTTERFLIES float
Okay, guys.
I see them later.
I can not believe that the journey had begun.
We spent so much time preparing us, and now we are on the way to truth.
Get me out of London!
I am going through conflicting emotions, and the bike is so heavy...
I already dropped it twice.
Is all very new and we face new problems.
I can not imagine doing this trip and I do not magnify with her.
It's a unique experience, and that changes your life.
COMING IN THE WAY LONGER
- I'm in trouble with the police.
- Because we were running.
Bye.
Come on, guys.
Do not want to eat testicles.
We are watching the otters.
Calm, Russ.
They are not obliged to let us enter.
Sneezed into the eyes of Ewan.
- The frame broke on both sides.
- Ldiota!
I thought if this is what's to come...
Be a nightmare.
My reaction, when it became difficult, was quitting.
And the guy in the backseat a gun.
I think Ewan has faced some very difficult days.
My God!
- We must leave this country.
- There are fires up there.
The hotel ice melted and the fire is coming this way.
Begin to slam on the brakes here not to end up down there.
- This is where the bridge ends.
- Our first river crossing.
It was an opportunity of a lifetime.
I love adventures.
Even changed my life.
It's shameful for a doctor to die from an illness.
Doctor, please don't talk anymore.
It's okay.
The reaper is already here to take me to the next world.
Everybody dies.
It doesn't matter how hard we try to live, we will eventually die.
Even so, what you accomplished in life...
It wasn't in vain.
But it's just our power was too weak.
Even at this moment, people are still dying.
This is war.
If so, what's the meaning of our work?
It seems that mankind wouldn't be satisfied if they didn't advance in everything.
Medical, military and everything...
Intelligence and power can either kill people or spare them.
Doctor.
Everything is up to the one in control of the power.
Don't think.
Just live.
How is the doctor?
Too bad.
He was a good man.
But I couldn't save him.
It's not your fault.
You're a nurse, not a doctor.
Besides, we didn't have the equipment or medicine.
If there was something here...
Only despair.
Anyway, I guess this place'll be closed down.
We can do nothing without a doctor.
Let's move the doctor out.
We're not even sure how it all began.
How many years have we been living here?
There is no sign that this war will ever end.
Saving people's lives is my job.
But even if they survive, they still can't escape from this world filled with despair.
Dying may be the only way to escape this world.
A helicopter'll be here tomorrow morning.
We have to be ready by then.
Hey!
Let her take a break.
Then you do her part of the work.
I'm okay.
I can take care of my share.
So we can finally get out of this dirty place.
Everywhere is gonna be the same.
I don't think so.
At least I don't have to see you anymore.
I'm going to pack my stuff.
Go on and keep fighting if you want.
Who's there?
Open the door.
We have an injured person here.
Which side are you on?
Isn't this a hospital?
Open up or we'll break down the door.
What is this?
What's going on?
Wait.
We didn't receive any advance notice of this!
She's was attacked suddenly.
There wasn't time to contact you.
Commander, here?
Commander?
Watch out your mouth!
Where's the doctor?
He died from an illness.
I'm a nurse.
This place'll be closed down soon.
Commander!
Then you do it.
This is terrible.
What happened?
It was so sudden.
In a flash of the eye.
I'm not sure what happened either.
She needs treatment from a better facility as soon as possible.
We don't have the time.
Just do your best.
Are you wondering about this box?
Your mission is to transport that box?
Better if you don't know.
It'll only bring you trouble.
What we are transporting is the Spear of Longinus.
Is it okay to tell them?
She's not going to recover.
You two join will take her place.
Wait a minute!
This place'll be closed down, right?
It's perfect timing.
I agree.
- What?
Wait!
That's an order.
What exactly is the Spear of Longinus?
This spear was used in order to confirm the death of the crucified Jesus Christ.
It used to be kept in Hofburg Palace in Austria but recently it's been proven that it's a fake.
So in order to have it again...
You dug it up?
What's the purpose of having it?
The Spear of Longinus is believed to miraculously cure any injury or disease.
We don't know if it's true or not but our leaders wants to have it.
What a stupid mission.
Don't you know the situation of the war is getting worse?
An order is an order.
We'll leave her here.
You two men will leave with us tomorrow morning.
Understood.
What about you?
Understood.
Who are you?
How did you get in?
That woman is dangerous.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about the injured woman.
There's going to be a big problem if you don't terminate her.
Were you following us?
What are you?
You don't look like a soldier.
Just terminate her right now.
What?
You crazy?
What do you mean, 'terminate her?
'
Kill her and then burn her body.
You're totally insane.
Want me to shoot him, Commander?
- No.
Wait.
Why should we do that?
You people will be in danger if you don't.
You should worry about your own safety.
Do you think we can do such a thing without a reasonable explanation?
He's wasting our time, Commander!
She's going to wake up soon and become a vampire.
Vampire?
What?
Avampire?
An actual vampire?
Yes.
Vampires have existed since a long time ago.
Quietly, just like shadows in darkness.
But that was only during times of peace.
In the ashes of war, death and violence are everywhere.
They have no reason to hide themselves anymore.
Insane.
Let's just...
- Wait.
Are you saying that what attacked us was a vampire?
She was attacked by a stray dog!
So what are you talking about?
Did you really see that?
She wasn't attacked by a stray dog.
You just want to think that happened.
They have their eye on what you're carrying.
The sacred spear has the power to destroy vampires.
That's why they want the spear.
So that they can destory it.
How do you know those things?
The vampire who attacked you is still around here.
I've been following that one for a long time.
So you're a vampire hunter?
Anyway, we'll listen to your story in detail later.
For right now, just drop to your knees and put your hands on your head.
On your knees!
Can't you come up with a better story?
You can believe in the miracle of the spear but not in vampires?
I don't believe in neither the miracle of the spear nor vampires.
I can't believe any of your story.
We're just completing our mission.
We don't care if the spear is real or fake.
But what if it's true.
Then it can heal anything, right?
That's how the story goes.
Then if we use it on her, her injuries will heal, right?
That's a good idea.
Let's use the power of the spear to heal her.
Our mission is to transport the spear.
But you weren't told not to open it, were you?
We can put it back after we're done.
Great.
No miracle will happen.
But if it can really save someone...
It's worth trying it.
That's stupid.
I don't want any part of it.
I think this mission is even more stupid though.
If we have to risk our life to transport it, I hope it really can make miracles happen.
You don't believe in miracles, do you?
Just wanna give a try.
See what happens.
Hey.
Take a look over there.
What's going on?
- She's awake.
It can't be!
It's impossible for her to move in that condition.
Then where did she go?
Did you do this?
Those who are bitten by vampire turns into vampires.
Vampires!
Vampires!
Stop it already!
Anyway, we have to find her.
There are several rooms in the basement.
I'll stay and watch this man.
You stay here.
Say, do you have some food?
Yes, if you don't mind having emergency rations.
Can you bring some here?
You did something unneccessary.
What happened?
- I don't know.
It's that man.
Where did he go?
Shit!
What's going on?
It's me.
Put your guns down.
You were immobilized.
What happened to your injuries?
It was nothing.
I've recovered already.
It can't be!
That's impossible!
You're Syo?
Then you don't know.
It's not as bad as you think.
Besides, I found a new medicine inside of this storage.
I felt so good after I took some.
I was suffering so much just minutes ago but I'm completely fine now.
Oh yeah...
I can give you guys some, too.
Come and get it!
No.
We don't need it.
Why not?
You don't want to be freed from this suffering?
Become one of us.
Now!
What is she?
A monster!
What happened?
I don't know.
He was already dead when I got back.
He was a vampire too.
That's not true.
We were always together.
He was pretending to be one of you to get to the spear.
He'd been bitten a long time ago.
Do you think I can believe what you're saying?
You saw it too, didn't you?
That woman wasn't a human being.
So what?
Drop your gun.
What he's saying is true.
Hey!
What are you doing?
You saw it too, right?
Vampires do exist.
Let's do what he says.
Our mission is to transport the spear.
Don't you want to kill that monster?
We're going to leave here with the spear!
End of story!
Drop your gun!
We can't escape from them anyway.
We have to kill that monster!
Drop the spear right now.
Otherwise, I'll shoot you.
Don't do it!
The vampires will come to attack you at any moment.
Drop it now.
We'll use the spear on them!
If you can't do that, then aren't you a vampire, too?
Who do you think you're talking to?
That's right.
You are a vampire!
Drop the gun or I'll shoot!
You bastard!
Which side are you on?
Is this what you wanted?
Was it your purpose to let them kill each other?
Stupid humans aren't worth fighting.
Human doesn't know how to use their own power.
See?
They always kill each other.
No.
They don't even know how to use that sacred spear.
That spear can make miracles if they knew how to use it.
It's time to join us now.
Now that you know how stupid the humans are.
You're also a vampire?
I'll think about that after I kill you.
All right.
Even if we vampires didn't exist, the humans would still kill each other.
The war will never end if a miracle doesn't happen.
You're a strange creature.
All you humans are.
Kill to live...
Live to die.
I've lived for too long.
You can kill me now if you want.
Use the spear to end my life.
I wanted to see the rising sun just once.
Where am I?
You've been saved.
I should have died.
I'm a vampire.
The Spear of Longinus makes miracles happen.
Even a vampire can see the rising sun now.
I don't know why I would want to keep living.
You're not the only one.
Nobody knows why they should.
I don't have anything anymore.
Why should I keep on living?
Maybe...
What about living for me, for example?
Maybe that won't be bad.
The Spear of Longinus.
It's believed to be a spear that makes miracles happen.
It's true.
It can change despair into hope.

(Horse whinnies )
There was once a knight in shining armor.
Handsome, noble and strong.
He dedicated himself to God and love.
St. George!
And the Lady Joan!
Wherever he went, he brought justice and mercy.
(Whimpers )
Many a time he rescued a damsel in distress and jousted to win his lady's favor.
Were there really knights like this in the Middle Ages?
or were the knights they remember here, in the Italian town of Cesena, more typical?
One day, in 1377, a troop of knights and armed men rode into the town, closed the gates and set about killing every man, woman and child.
One report claimed that 5,000 unarmed civilians were slaughtered in one day.
The knight in charge of this massacre was an Englishman.
His name was Sir John Hawkwood.
What on earth had happened to the golden age of chivalry?
Our story of the knight begins in 1066... when William the Bastard conquered England.
The Anglo-Saxons called his followers "cnihts"
which became knights.
William, who now understandably changed his name to William the Conqueror rewarded his knights with land and property.
But they didn't pay rent.
Instead, they had to provide military service for the king.
The whole system was designed as a war machine.
And the sort of knight who did well in it was not the quiet, retiring type.
The ability to beat another man to a bloody pulp or cut him to pieces was not merely a requirement of knighthood.
It was one of its ideals.
Richard the Lionheart, for example, was celebrated amongst the knightly classes for his habit chopping his victims' skulls down to the teeth.
But to anyone who wasn't a knight, this was a problem.
How could you control these men?
How could you channel their testosterone culture into something that was less destructive in society?
The idea society came up with was to try and invent a code of behavior by which the knightly class must learn to govern themselves.
Well, it certainly seemed like a good idea.
What made the Norman knights different was the fact they fought on horseback.
And since the French for horse was "cheval", a mounted warrior was known as a chevalier.
And so the code of conduct for knights, indeed their whole culture, became known as chivalry.
But what exactly was chivalry?
Well, it depended who you were.
The knights themselves had no doubt what chivalry meant to them.
It meant learning how to kill people, making money and getting famous.
And in the 12th century, the man who best embodied what knights thought chivalry was was Sir William Marshal.
William was already hardened to the perils of battle by the ripe old age of five.
In 1152, William's father, John the Marshal, rebelled against King Stephen and the king laid siege to John's castle.
Oop!
During the siege, his father handed William over as a hostage and at one point the king put the boy into a catapult and threatened to shoot him back over the castle walls!
William's father shouted back that he didn't care about the child since he had the hammer and the anvils to make more and better sons.
William clearly knew what it was to have a caring, loving father.
And just to make sure he got the point, when his father died, he didn't leave his son a penny.
William was faced with two alternatives.
Join the church or become a knight.
So William went to Normandy, where his cousin ran a sort of military academy.
Exactly what William might have learned there was demonstrated to me by Steve Mallett, a specialist in medieval horsemanship and historian Tobias Capwell.
- It looks frightening!
- I think that's the idea.
- They train them to rear?
- Absolutely, yes.
There's manuscript evidence that actually shows horses being trained to kick, to strike out at a shield that's held by an attendant.
So the horse is a weapon?
The horse is the most powerful weapon that a knight has.
And what's the most crucial part of that training for the horse?
Well, the horse is a flight animal.
And its natural reaction, which is perfectly sensible, if there is a threat so you run away.
But what Steve's doing here is teaching a horse to override its natural instinct.
The training should bring the horse to a point where it's really an extension of the rider.
The horse's legs are moving as if they're the rider's own legs.
And then when the rider asks for something it happens instantly.
I bet there were times when William felt he wasn't getting anywhere.
He was still broke, but at least he was learning to join the ruling class.
(Tobias ) Right now he's working to move the horse sideways.
The ability to subtly change your line against an opponent is extremely important.
This is really about power steering.
- He just stops just like that.
- Absolutely.
Absolutely.
Power brakes as well.
very important.
At the end of it all,
William was dubbed a knight by the Earl of Tankerville.
Now at last he was equipped to earn a bit of ready cash.
And he didn't even need to go to war.
There was plenty to be made on the tournament circuit.
In the early days, a tournament was a miniature war, played for sport.
The tournament field stretched over miles and could include villages and towns.
It was a bit like the Isle of Man Grand Prix, only with knights chasing each other on horseback, and hacking at everyone with swords.
It was terribly popular.
The money-making came when you captured another knight and held him for ransom.
William hit the jackpot with his first tournament.
His biographer tells us,
"only that morning Marshal had been a poor man
"as regards possessions and horses
"but now he had four and a half fine mounts."
I'm not quite sure what he did with the half a horse.
- Maybe he ate it.
- (Whinnies )
(clears throat)
Sir William didn't just get rich.
He achieved that other aim of chivalry.
Fame.
While he was still in training, he caught the eye of Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine.
Well, a lot of young knights did.
But then he served her husband Henry II with great success.
In return for his loyal service,
Henry rewarded William with the hand of the most eligible heiress on the market.
She came complete with oodles of land and her own castle.
And this is it.
Chepstow.
Well, the landless William had finally become a man of property.
It was every knight's dream come true.
He was famous as a warrior and one of the richest men in England.
( # Gregorian chanting)
When he was buried at Temple church in London in 1219, the Archbishop of Canterbury called William Marshal
"the best knight in the world".
Fame, wealth and God's approval.
It's what chivalry was all about.
If you were a knight.
oh, and sex.
Knights used chivalry to legitimize doing the things they liked doing.
Violence was intrinsic to the cult of chivalry.
Even, you may be surprised to learn, violence to women.
According to the great chivalric writer Chretien De Trois
"If a knight found a damsel alone,
"he would sooner think of cutting his own throat
"than of offering her dishonor.
"But on the other hand,
"if the damsel were accompanied by another knight,
"and if it pleased him to give combat to that knight and win the lady by arms
"then he might do his will with her just as he pleased
"and no shame or blame whatsoever would attach to him."
Well, isn't chivalry just full of little surprises?
( # Discordant fanfare )
So for the knights, chivalry meant fighting, fame and fortune.
But there were others who wanted to harness the power of chivalry in their own interests.
The church, which was itself often the victim of the knights' violence, had the bright idea of diverting their energies.
(Shouting)
In 1095, pope Urban II reversed centuries of Christian doctrine by announcing that it was now fine for violent young men to butcher people, so long as the victims weren't Christian.
From all over Europe, knights flocked to the cause.
At the capture of Jerusalem in 1099, they boasted of wading in infidel blood up to their knees.
Hitherto, knights would have had to do penance for killing.
But now the killing was the penance.
In 1276, the Catalan knight-turned-hermit Ramon Lull thought he'd better lay down some ethical guidelines.
Lull said the proper chivalric knight's first duty was to defend the Christian faith.
Then his lord and then women, widows, and orphans.
For Lull, even the knights' equipment was full of religious significance.
The mail coat protected him like a castle against vice.
The helmet was a symbol of the knight's fear of shame.
The sword reminded him of Christ on the cross.
The shield signified how he should defend his lord and the spear stood for truth and strength.
There was a third power in the land with an interest in controlling the violence of the knights.
This was their earthly lord, the king.
( # Bagpipes )
To keep knights on side, the king was happy to offer glamor, pageantry and all the fun of dressing up.
What's more, in royal employment, knights could become part of the fantasy worlds they enjoyed in their stories.
Edward III for example revived the glorious, though entirely fictitious, traditions of King Arthur.
Windsor castle was to be his new camelot and he planned to set up a round table of no less than 300 knights.
He must have realized he was heading for a catering disaster with 300 knights round one table.
So he went for something more exclusive.
He created two tournament teams, each of 13 star knights.
These were to be the 26 members of the Order of the Garter.
And this is the order's home, St. George's chapel, Windsor.
Even today, to be a Knight of the Garter is about as exclusive as it gets.
As a perk, you get free storage for your crest and banner here in the chapel.
These are today's Garter knights.
You can still see them arranged on either side of the chapel in two teams, just as they would have been in Edward's day.
Up there there's Sir Edmund Hillary, the conqueror of Everest with a kiwi and an ice pick.
And that banner is Sir Edward Heath, with a morning cloud.
That was the name of his yacht.
And over at the end there is the Baroness Thatcher.
She's the only one without a sword.
Probably going to give her a battleax.
But why did medieval knights feel they needed to stick swans and trees on their helmets?
Why indeed have banners?
The thing is nowadays we recognize famous people by their faces because we've seen photos of them countless times in the newspapers.
But back in the Middle Ages, you'd have no idea what anyone looked like unless you'd actually met them face to face.
And that's why people had coats of arms.
So, David, if I were to be granted a coat of arms, to tell people who I am, what might it look like?
Well, we have prepared an approval sketch which shows what you might be granted.
So you see here the main charge on the shield is very bold and simple.
It's a great, big, yellow snake.
It's a gold python, which is a reference to Monty Python.
For the crest, animals make the best crests, and we heard that you were rather dominated by your bossy cat at home, so we've given you your cat and it's holding a quill pen to represent your writing career.
I would like to point out that the cat does not do my writing for me.
Ah!
I see there's a motto here.
"Messias non est."
- You know what that means.
- Ah. "He's not the Messiah."
Hm.
(Miaow )
So if I charged into battle with a cat on my head you'd know who it was.
You'd also know who it was running away as soon as the fighting started.
It was a kind of dare to ride into battle with your name plastered all over you.
on the other hand, heraldry could also act as a sort of life insurance policy.
one knight, Sir Robert Knolles, used to ride into battle with an inscription on his helmet which read, "Whoever captures Sir Robert Knolles
"will gain 100, 000 gold coins. "
Well, you're not going to kill a golden goose like thatI
Chivalry was so crucial to the conduct of knights that Edward III set up a court of chivalry and believe it or not, one still exists.
And this is it.
The Earl Marshal's court in the college of Arms.
At the moment, it's an exhibition space for these rather surreal heraldic devices.
So what sort of cases did the court of chivalry deal with?
Knights on trial for failing to open the drawbridge for a damsel or running away from the dragon?
Uh-uh.
The major preoccupation of the courts of chivalry was money.
There were always squabbles to be settled about who owned the rights to which prisoner or how the booty was to be split.
The other major concern of the court of chivalry was settling disputes over the rights to a particular coat of arms or crest.
Sometimes the cases went on for years.
So, did chivalry reduce the horror of war in any way?
Well, yes, it could do.
So long as you happened to be a knight.
Edward III's son, the Black prince, was, according to his biographer, the perfect root of all honor and nobleness, of wisdom, valor and largesse.
Here's how he put chivalry into practice.
In 1370, the people of Limoges rebelled against the rule of the Black Prince.
The prince hastened to crush the rebellion and during the fighting three French knights were cornered by the Duke of Lancaster.
Eventually they had no choice but to surrender.
My lords, we are yours!
You have vanquished us.
Therefore act according to the law of arms.
"My God!" replied the Duke of Lancaster.
"We do not intend otherwise
"and we accept you for our prisoner."
The Duke of Lancaster would make a tidy sum from the ransoms and the French knights would live to fight another day.
So, fine if you were a knight, but the townspeople were not knights and the Black prince's chivalry didn't extend quite that far.
"All ranks, ages and sexes
"cast themselves on their knees before the prince,
"begging for mercy.
"All were put to the sword.
"Upwards of 3,ooo men, women and children
"were put to death that day."
The whole point is, these chivalric laws of war had absolutely nothing to do with the Geneva Convention.
Nowhere in the order of the Garter was there anything about protecting civilians or the proper treatment of ordinary prisoners of war.
chivalry was strictly for the toffs.
The irony was, while Edward III was busy glamorizing the code of chivalry, at the same time, he had no intention of fighting the French by it.
The army he took across the Channel in 1339 was fundamentally different in its make-up from previous armies.
You see, the nature of warfare was changing, thanks largely to economics.
In the 14th century, there was an arms race going on just the same as today and knights were finding it increasingly expensive to get themselves onto the battlefield.
Since Roman times, the standard bit of kit had been the mail coat.
But developments in missile technology had brought a new kind of arrow that could go straight through mail.
And a new kind of crossbow was developed with even greater penetrating power.
So knights started looking for extra protection.
Of course, weapons evolved to be more effective against plate armor.
There's an old French song that describes a knight so terrified that he soiled his saddle blanket.
I'm not surprised.
As the expense soared, many of the landed gentry tried to avoid military service.
So when Edward landed in France at the beginning of what was to be the Hundred Years War, the bulk of his army were paid soldiery, mostly from the lower ranks of society.
This army also contained another element that was enough to make any noble knight soil his saddle blanket.
For all his chivalrous talk,
Edward was preparing a distinctly down-to-earth surprise for the French.
He had thousands and thousands of well-trained peasant archers all armed with longbows.
Never mind the chivalry - kill the horses.
At the Battle of Crecy in 1346, thousands of French noblemen charged in full pageantry.
But the English were playing by a different rule book.
In five minutes of battle, the English loosed more than 3oo,ooo arrows.
The flower of French chivalry was cut down by archers on threepence a day.
In all, the French lost over 5,000 men to a few hundred English.
In 1360, both sides had had enough.
A peace treaty was signed and that was when the world changed.
Edward said, "Right, my lot home.
Stop fighting.
Home, everybody!"
Nobody took any notice.
They were having far too good a time.
You see, a lot of Edward's army didn't have any homes to go to.
They may have been fighting in France for 20 years.
They may have captured a castle and there they were, living like lords.
Why should they go home?
And so a new kind of military captain emerged.
Many styled themselves knights whether they'd been actually knighted or not.
And they formed themselves into what they called Free Companies fighting neither for lord nor God but for themselves.
They were bands of robbers on a nightmare scale.
One company was reported to be 16,000 strong.
The Free companies swept down through France causing havoc and destruction.
And eventually they descended on Avignon here which in those days happened to be the residence of the Pope.
They burnt the surrounding countryside and threatened to attack God's representative on earth unless he handed over a spiritually uplifting sum of money.
Eventually, the pope coughed up around 100,000 florins, enough to pay a 14th-century construction worker for about, oh, 3,000 years.
God's representative on earth was a realist and he knew they couldn't be bought off easily.
So he said to the brigands, "Look, boys.
"I'll throw in free pardons
"for all the sins you may have committed up to now.
"And I'll even have a word with a man I know who can find you some work in Italy.
"Can't say fairer than that, can I?"
Now, it wasn't a stupid suggestion.
Italy was full of career opportunities for mercenary soldiers with nowhere to go.
Of course, Italy didn't actually exist in those days.
It consisted of a lot of city states like Pisa, Rome,
Florence, Milan, Mantua and so on.
And they'd been at each other's throats for centuries.
But the citizens weren't exactly interested in fighting.
So they'd got into the habit of employing mercenary companies to do their fighting for them.
Which bring us back to this chap, Sir John Hawkwood, perhaps the most famous English knight of his day.
He was not a nobleman, but the son of a tanner, who'd made his way up through the ranks.
Hawkwood soon established his own mercenary company and made such a good living fighting for whoever would pay him that he was able to buy several castles, like this one in Tuscany.
Not bad for a poor lad from Essex.
Sir John was not a chivalric knight.
He had no pretence to lofty ideals and he didn't fight for glory or honour.
He was simply a businessman whose business happened to be war.
In 1377, Hawkwood was under contract to a certain cardinal by the name of Roberto.
Now, Roberto had a quarrel with the citizens of this town, Cesena.
They'd murdered some of his soldiers.
However, Roberto magnanimously offered them an amnesty if they'd surrender their arms.
Foolishly, the citizens of Cesena thought they could trust the word of a cardinal priest of the order of the Holy Apostles.
As soon as they were disarmed, cardinal Roberto summoned Hawkwood from nearby Faenza where he'd been busy coordinating the rape of all the female inhabitants.
The cardinal said he wanted justice.
By justice he meant blood and more blood.
The resulting massacre shocked Europe.
According to one chronicler, they burnt and slaughtered all the town.
The river was colored with blood and among the smoking ruins, the rapes, the killings, was a pitiful episode.
24 friars were killed in front of the main altar, along with the congregation.
One account claimed that 8,000 had died and 16,000 fled.
Every building was destroyed.
However, this wasn't the sort of thing that harmed a military man's reputation.
Far from it.
And for the last 15 years of his life,
Hawkwood was under more or less permanent contract to the city of Florence.
When Hawkwood died, the city laid on a funeral of epic proportions and celebrated him as a hero.
The Florentines never lost their sense of business.
You see, they promised Hawkwood a magnificent marble tomb right here in the great cathedral of Florence.
However, when Richard II requested Hawkwood's body be returned to England, the Florentines decided to cut their losses and instead they put up this magnificent painting of what the magnificent marble tomb would have looked like if they'd built it.
Nonetheless, the tanner's son from Essex had become virtually a nobleman by turning warfare into a business.
The mercenary and the knight had become one and the same.
But was there ever really a difference?
The knight of fantasy never really did exist.
All that rescuing damsels and helping the weak was just wishful thinking.
Even in the Middle Ages, chivalry could mean what you wanted it to mean.
Maybe we are better off without chivalry.
Its fine ideals were all too often used to perpetuate warfare which is what those who live by war want.
One of Hawkwood's contemporaries said of him he managed his affairs so well there was little peace in Italy in his time.
And I guess it's still true that those who promote war are usually those who are going to profit from it, whether they're arms manufacturers, politicians or knights in shining armor.

They have no imagination, that these types à the gym will continue idéal.
To lift this stuff, and get on this stuff, it's dangerous.
Nobody should être là inside.
All ça to carve out a body idéal, but all they come out, is a body harder, musclé, carré more, that's all.
The objective, the main word, it is "idéal"...
You can have what you want .
My body idéal, sûrement it would be just a... eye, it did sûrement need only one... stuff foam à instead of teeth, because we're always emmerdé with ça.
And a super long tube with after my ass for not having à look into it.
Ca, it would idéal.
Ashtrays are also illégaux...
All those people who are asking implants is déprimant
I see no ... not at all what the purpose.
If they want more love, attention or what, but they choose places like évidents là...
But if they want attention , why not in the eyes
And they'll put your eyes où tétons were, and within the tête.
Ca, ça attracts attention.
And be careful à itself très is boring, à be careful what you eat, eat cabbage and stuff, nobody wants to ça.
You eat them fast enough, they arrêtent not happen again.
But be aware make concessions while growing up.
I am végétarien, example.
But I'm not intégriste.
You know, I like meat.
Just because I like the goût.
So, morally, I gagné.
Je déconne pas avec ça.
Les gens me conseillent de manger que du poisson.
Ou que des légumes.
Carrément tout éliminer.
I eat that têtes.
Keep everything, I just take ça.
Take the rest and spend the tête à fry quickly.
I like interacting with my food.
And you always win their sympathy if you eat the eyes.
Même ça... it's become something increasingly difficult à apprécier, just eat.
Because ça has été fétichisé by this idéal art of living.
The Kitchen émissions that everyone looks are laughable.
You do not need an aquarium in the atrium that you did not.
And people feel obligés been published, in their own lives.
Who has time at his home that really the time to dépiauter bébé the rabbit soak in tears Duck nail on the pergola, and the torch work for it has the right texture, même color and the tomatoes that you écrasées just with elbows?
Who... has the time?
Nobody lives like ça.
Everyone says that all others do.
What happening is that you come home from work , and you say, if you really like:
"Tonight, we will eat something that has more than two colors. "
But you can not do it.
You find yourself in front of the vautré télé, à eat bread in bags that you dip into anything softer than of bread.
Because we do not time time for this shit.
I know those guys who lie to you by telling you that you are fainéant, as you know how to live.
And they ça with wine, they always try to tell you
What's in it, compliqué how it is, they say:
"It is...
" From Moccasin...
"From détachant à the ; acétone...
"It is extraordinary.
Perfect if you are sued by the Stasi. "In a dark tunnel, while you will meet a monk." There are two kinds of wine.
And ça, everyone knows it.
There is one that you drink saying:
"Yeah, it's good.
Can have 8 bottles of it là? "
And there is the other, you do:
Il y a celui que tu bois en disant :
"Mouais, il est bon.
On peut en avoir 8 bouteilles de celui-là ?"
Et il y a l'autre, tu fais :
"Damn, what's that thing?"
Occasionally, I admit, there are wines more subtle:
"Well, it is good.
Yeah, not bad. "
And there's nothing else à add, really.
People really .. .
need... bad things for them.
Really.
Stimulants, all that stuff.
Always.
Every time when these politicians, footballers or another, chopé is in a room hôtel, entouré of whores and of cocaïne, everyone says:
"Oh, it's shameful,
" how did you have it?
As c ' is despicable!
"I have never done ça...
" I've never had a chance...
But I would never fact ça
"J'en ai jamais eu l'occasion...
Mais j'aurais jamais fait ça !
"Oh, that through me the dégoût right now,
" you could put in the bottle. "
What do you filerais other à of prostituées in hôtel
"Someone wants yogurt?
I made this morning.
Someone? "" There are fruits and everything.
Oh, come on! " Everyone is corrupt in a room hôtel.
You can not worry empêcher.
This is the only place in the world où 1ère thing you do, what is biting everything you can, before même remove your paletaud.
Jumping on the bed, bathing cap on tête, you wonder:
"What can I do?"
En sautant sur le plumard, le bonnet de bain sur la tête, tu te demandes :
"Qu'est-ce que je peux faire ?"
I think this is the fact that téléphone ça, there are small pictures, because you see, most modern technology do not work.
This is censé help you, but it is also a énorme piège.
As laptops, everyone has one now, même I'm going to start.
ruiné It has everything.
People call you: "Hi, I'm in my bath!"
"Yes, but you're still the même asshole...
" I espère you going drown, and hello ".
And they have rotted because of the to announce news, to tell things.
You came back from garden, you décrochais combiné in the bakélite 3 kg, to say "Miriam is dead!"
You can do more.
It is déjà à côté:
"Yeah, she tête à the upside, exorbités eyes, like looks,
"you know what I mean?
She is in deep shit."
It's the same...
It's same with the Internet.
I when people look at me I tell them: "No, I'm using it.
" I can not... " This is true.
People look at you as if t'étais tombé of a tree.
And they understand not.
They ask:
"Why not?
" You can not être à page. "
How can I être more à page?
I am alive, là...
This is not trivial, ça.
I like not distributors tickets.
, still open à 1am you trying to focus you, and it arrête not ask you questions.
- "You êtes happy with your sandwich?
- I know!
" I'm not emballé these sausages!
- "Do you check your account?
- You're what?
My mère?
"It is où button shaped bière?"
A bottle... why Voilà ça happening in the room hôtel.
You can not...
There these images.
You see the button with the image type with his plate, you press it, and it comes with a sandwich
And you think "Yes, yes, yes,
" I contrôle the pigeon sandwich...
"It's a magical land, a magical land ..."
With these small téléphones Wizard of Oz.
But sûr well...
You have to monitor.
You can not do everything, you can ça roost.
This is très étrange, when même, it is measured with the number of tricks that you détruisent.
When you're young, you can go out, you do everything you want, you can drink juice all soirée battery, réveiller for you and you fight.
And your cooked are not so bad, that à âge.
They are plutôt direct a bit like prison guards who say: "You have été très stupid last night.
Lève up!
- "Go into the kitchen.
- No, I'm désolé...
-" Shut up.
Goes into the kitchen.
- What I did...
"You chialais, mainly." But when you're older, this is really méchant, because when you réveilles, you think you're viré...
"It's a beautiful journée...
"The birds are swinging, trees sing...
" Magnificent...
"I believe that I'll walk me après...
"Can être même à the sea .."
à You start believing your own bullshit .
You think that's what you've sandwich bouffé Wednesday.
I know two or three things above là.
Je connais 2 ou 3 trucs là-dessus.
And once you got trainé jusqu'à the kitchen door goblins and all you have done ... You cough and you
crèves.
You see, we measure how much has amusé with the weight of emmerdes in which it was fourré.
You go out tonight, you put the tête, détruis you, someone asks you the following:
"How c'était last night?"
And you répondras "C'était génial.
I see nothing...
" I feel nothing.
No sensation.
I have nothing left. "I get more même à make sentences. " You'd come dû, you will have lost an ear... "
The main thing is that you façon poisoned.
"T'aurais dû venir, t'y aurais perdu une oreille..."
Le principal, c'est la façon dont tu t'empoisonnes.
best, really, it's the wine , ça comes softly, imaginative you stay, you can eat, talk à people, and à a while, someone will say : "I know...
I know...
" we're going to play golf...
"in Croatia..."
And you say: "Great, I know someone who can déposer,
" me... "
This is not the same with the bière.
bière has sûrement été inventée by food businesses.
Just for that People roam the streets à 1am.
"Ca bouge ?
Chope-le.
C'est une nonne ?
Attrape-moi ça !"
La vodka, c'est très traitre.
Ca s'est démocratisé pour les gamins, maintenant.
kids 3 years...
This is not good.
Because it is a drink traitor, wood you by telling you:
"What is it?
Makes no intérêt,
"ça goût no, no smell, why slamming our dough in...
" What are we doing on a île déserte ?
Huh? "
And whiskey, everyone drinks it now is a hard drink.
It'll dédouble a little...
One of you is super nice.
The étrangers arrive and you do:
"Come in, come.
Sit.
Name of God, bouffez something.
"Sleep in my bed."
And suddenly, without prévenir, another débarque:
"Steer yourself from home.
Go, get out,
"and leave a tip..."
But the most dangerous drink, it's gin.
You have to really Attention très ça.
Déjà must être 45 women, sitting in a staircase ...
Because it's not really a drink, it's more a Mascarat.
"Nobody likes of Footwear my...
" I made 50 fucking vol-au-vent, and not one of you, not one of you, said no thank you!
And my préférée:
"Everybody shut up!
" This song is for me... "
What's for fun...
But...
There are other times, you say...
It's a phénomène très Irish and même England in a lot of places, lighthouses, marine bars...
Sometimes you think: "I do not live as à ça...
" I do not à ça. " You can do without.
Nah, you think about it not so long that ça...
But...
It crosses your mind you.
It changes a lot when you get older, I think.
Because you can not do ça throughout your life.
You're getting old a bit, you can have après children, très quickly you become responsible , I guess.
Or enragé more... and frustré, prisoner of your own life...
Because the kids are très chouchoutés.
Really.
Right?
It's true, with all these... ça?
privilèges And all they have.
The kids who want another biscuit, those who want... their own jeep kids who need stuff.
Since when I have not seen a kid who needs nothing.
Since when I have not seen a kid do :
"I had enough strawberry pie for today , thank you.
"I'll go clean the car, OK?"
But what's really...
kids?
Some drunks miniature voilà what it is...
You know many people who greet you in the morning you breaking the jaw?
In babbling anyhow!
All journée ... They can not walk straight même.
You could put them on an infinite surface , find a button and they would use their journée à push.
And après it must take them emergencies when you do something important like être sitting.
They want to eat like alcoholics.
"What do you want to goûter
" From tiramisu, fried with sugar. "
They talk as types bourrés.
"It's time to go to bed..."
"Go take your bath..."
"Get out of the bath... "
" Do something nonviolent more than 5 seconds, will you? "
In England, they passed this law , which forbids you to... éduquer of your children physically.
It saddens me a bit.
Before, I m'échappais the faster the job to hit my children...
Being with them...
It are a whole lot of manières à a child to say:
"Arrête have fun à toggle switch,
" you déjà put your finger on the objective of this expérience,
"when you éteins, Dad sees nothing at all.
" It trébuche on your toys for try to catch you and kill you,
"pétant by the foot..."
Children know the power that ; they là.
You're morally obligé arrêter of whatever you do, and having a "discussion".
Because .. .
If not, they do not understand.
I think that children are the mêmes now.
It's not that I saw mêmes j'étais when younger.
In fêtes, you do your pranks, run around, bleed...
Torture the weakest member of the group ...
The pranks all bêtes.
It's more like ça.
I have a birthday été à, young people who had in 10 years étaient and they each in their corner, as dead bees... café with their milk...
They all étaient là, carefree.
Like Berlin in 1929.
What's happening?
I see a allé garçon "Qu ' , is this happening? "
What?
You have 10 years, then you can drown t'électrocuter, not having migraine.
And the girls too, I tell them I demandé "Why nobody plays?"
She répondu "Oh, that's all fêtes...
"It was cap, we dress well.
But nobody sees who you are...
" Fetch me a martini, you want? " Can
être ... it's just the sophistication.
attention.
They are more careful.
The daughter of a friend of mine était one of his drawings on the fridge, stuff that you should always play
I was trying to être nice, I said "It's mom and bébé?"
She said: "No, it ' ;
is a skeleton who is nursing a à curé. "
Elle m'a dit : "Non, c'est un squelette qui donne le sein à un curé."
- "Been Goya?
- No, désolé..."
... But there is this terrible moment, when your kid looks at you and ask you : "Dad, it's organic ça?"
"Pardon?"
I grew up with Tagada!
C'était ça, the main course.
There was no food, à all meals, c'était of néon
It took 3 seconds à préparer.
As ça, my parents could fairce they wanted.
Their fêtes...
If I found this Dolto I will kick your ass.
I'm jealous, terribly jealous génération of my parents.
Ils avaient tout bon.
Les gens qui étaient en couple, à l'époque.
want, couples, is something else... and no one says you can couples to have friends, à some âge.
Because children.
Your décide kid to play with another, then you're obligé of meet propriétaires.
And you hit them with you while they puff for
Or at home, you can not où you détendre because it is larger, more beautiful and clean.
You find yourself in their bathroom telling you:
"I can not relax me here, there is no pubic hair collés...
" With us, there to ceiling... "
And they are always in compétition.
All this stuff when you get:
"Voilà the entrée, voilà the kitchen, the living room voilà."
I know...
"Voilà the fridge nubuck, whole house is nubuck.
- "We, too, is ça Roy?
- Yes, chérie."
"Julie is happy très école in the village, in the forêt,
"a small arcade, a small paradise.
Multi-confessional sûr well,
" Rastafarianism, non-zen, they are all là...
"18 teachers per child, they all have their laptop...
" users from viewing live at the Pentagon... "
I do not need this compétition.
I came here because you said you did a damn chicken...
The génération of my parents, baby boomers après of-war, they had what they wanted.
They were all good.
They reached the majorité in années 60, and Government them demandé "What you need?"
"I know not, why not the pill?
You can have
"Although sûr.
Voilà.
Something else
"Music?
Voilà, the Beatles, the Stones arrive later
" Velvet Underground, Janis Joplin finishes eating and it happens.
"Well, if you want to do something,
" let your hair grow and fornicate like bêtes... "
" If you ça branch more, paint your house orange and eat a lawyer. "
But when ça has été around Our génération, we arrivé à the majorité "Well, what can we do?"
"Do not fuck person or you'll die!
"It's okay.
There will bientôt MC Hammer... "
Not really a good deal...
Still, I essayé, believe me I essayé... to love rap.
And I feel très très old...
J ' ; have to drag... essayé the stairs.
But I can not do...
I understand the blues.
It is beautiful.
The story of people who détestent big industry.
"I have nothing, but they took ça also...
"I même no guitar, I'm just going scratch my belly."
Names of scène géniaux,
"Blind Dead McJones"...
But rap is not ça, it is mostly what people have.
The réputation.
très It's aggressive.
"I've got hoes, I have a limo, a limo rolling juice whore
"and bagouzes in my limo."
They say anything nice.
Never.
It's always " I will stumble, you and your père,
"you drag your ass to your mère, drink your blood..."
It is où, the dignité
What happens to them when they get older
I espère that there is a retirement home for them infirmière with a pulpy.
Who: "It's time for your émission, Eminem...
"Leave the cookies alone Puff Daddy, do not remake ça."
This is a mentalité so infantile, you ask à a boy of 10 years:
"What do you think the world
" It's rotten.
Because I'm not what I want.
"I want a purple chair, I want fries, right away."
This is a rap song... everything they say, and they make millions of dollars, for this... shit.
And they run for dépenser in a fur coat cheeseburgers, and a jet privé.
J'étais in this bar, there are some années,
I never forget.
C'était the music played... était génial the bar, he était empty.
rentré I am, I had a book, I wanted to ask an hour to sit and être.
Génial, nothing better than a bar empty.
And this music is passée, I never forget.
C'était "Funk Soul Brother"
I never forget, because c'était also all the words.
C'était école of this écriture, not too hard with the words,
Can être if they où défoncent, I dunno, there's a trick .
It sounded a bit like a million fire trucks chasing ambulances 10 million in a battlefield.
ça à a volume that made the empty chair bleed derrière me.
ça was "Funk soul brother,
" right away, yeah.
"Funk soul brother, écoute ça,
"Funk soul brother is, roughly,
"... it is just for you.
"it is the funk soul brother. "
After a moment, I understood the meaning of this song.
I noted that someone was coming , apparently everyone in satisfied, he must provide gâteau.
But the trick, he c'était était yet là .
C'était the feint.
But I'm not saying it's bad.
Nothing ça.
All what I'm saying is that you could take , say, a broom, soak it in brake fluid, the other end put me in the ass me stalling on a trampoline, in an elevator that goes up,
and j'écrirais something better on the walls, that's all...
I essayé, but I can not do, because...
I remember when the singers étaient singers, types ugly...
Aretha Franklin needed a lot place to eat his nuggets.
Janis Joplin came on scène with his clothes covered with vomit.
And Nina Simone, she could complete a railway at him.
c'était But okay, they étaient beautiful by what they did.
Now they have these pop trainées laid by some sort of machine.
They have no talent, but some parts of their body célèbres more than them, their ass trip in a jet séparé until the concert.
But they are nothing.
They are what?
Même It is not people.
Just stuff that fill strings.
I am intimidé any ça.
The youthful appearance that there is.
I see more young people in the street, when I go out .
I see. ..
I see djeuns.
As they are in décrits police reports, that's all.
All soft shapeless, under their hood.
With their pitbulls and a brazier full of old.
They send as SMS, because they abandonné speech.
As the crickets at night.
plotting horrible things, like making cider à from the blood.
Comme les grillons la nuit.
Conspirant des trucs horribles, comme faire du cidre à partir du sang.
très I feel old.
à côté When I pass them, ça I do now, I pick my clés...
I squeezed them hard, and I spend à côté, clés I push my fingers.
As ça, if I hit one of them,
I would crève face!
In this bar, a young girl très beauty who served me, she had jewelry and facial whole thing, loops, pious, and crucifixion nails, même its vêtements m ' intimidated, marqué his T-shirt:
"Porn Mongoloïde Infernal"
And I thought: "It must être soirée a busy...
"How she could take a taxi far?"
Scary, really scary stuff .
So I look forward to être damn old really, really old.
When I could être to the restaurant with my son and my daughter and say:
"You know what I just did?
I pissé above...
"You démerdez with ça...
" Yeah, continues à me about your job, your divorce,...
"Honnêtement, j'écoutais not really.
" Which of you I could drown dû, à ça I thought...
The are old boring stuff, when you talk to them kind of forget your name, or tell même the story 50 times.
They forget not your name.
They know they you have said 50 times.
à death... à They want to see what you're prêt for hériter of life, that's all.
This is current être about à ça, in adult conversations.
Many conversations are just a bunch of lies.
We spend a lot time à être polite to people.
It shows up saying "Oh, I'm désolé être of late.
" There was a movement, oh, really horrible ,
"I practice a dû trichotomy on a camel,
" just with a rake Garden,
"c'était très difficult I désolé."
You just être honnète and say:
"Uh I knew you étiez là.
"In fact, j'étais my house, I sent me a donut...
" And it était délicieux, because I knew you were waiting...
"I've never really aimé.
" But if we do this réunion, I can have something à drink
"for that I fall?"
But people snap, they use always lies.
Tricks énormes, fair game, as:
"It's not you, it's me."
It's never you, it's always him.
être must be frank with them.
We must tell them:
"You remember that weird noise, when you fall asleep ?
"C'était mâchais me that the bed.
" Because I'm bored.
Oh, how I déteste.
"I'm so déteste ça that gives me énergie.
" I have to get up to tôt détester you,
" because there is not enough time in the journée.
"If-you-please, get out."
And this other bullshit "I need space."
People do not really quantify space they need.
But strangely, ça looks être mêmes the height, volume, air as you.
Look, I told myself that the c'était 1ère moitié somehow
I should go là.
And we will return to continue.
It is terribly hot, and you're thirsty, right?
See you soon.
Bye.

I also...
What is the valence of béryllium
Do you mean...
plans for the future
What are we talking about?
Ah, yes...
Yeah, Iraq...
I trouvé all ça à really hard to follow.
And I speak not about Ireland, because they know nothing, actually.
Finally, what I remember... when j'étais here when j'étais réellement Irish before I betray the country barring me...
When the information résumaient à is:
"We'll build a bridge, but there not rivière...
"to pass on. was annulé, then nobody is going to work..."
This kind of stuff...
The latest international news are more... dramatic, I think.
I'm not très policy.
I understand nothing,
I prétends not understand the moitié.
I do not like people who belong .
People who are liées à politics remind me those people with whom you live and who you leave Post-It.
In the apartments, you know?
From the genre: "More café.
Not that ça m'énerve,
" c'était but mine.
"It était on my étagère, and he été enlevé of là.
"If someone wants to replace, I would take it a lot."

Tina...
And I've been too...
"Chère Tina, everyone déteste you...
"Including people that you have not yet rencontrés.
" Your mère appelé to say she has aimé would never know you. "
But you can not make you...
They always say stuff horrible
they should always insult.
It this woman is which queries a minister.
conservatiste leader Michael Howard saucepans he had lying around.
There has been fit- in, il avait des casserolles qui trainaient.
Il y a eu du rentre-dedans, but it was she who spoke...
This is a journalist who is known for his appearance is unfair, but its voice... à resembles that of a stégosaure that ass on fire...
Or a type that tries to drown for months...
How do you keep all of nails on a blackboard only
There is nothing to à, passé 30 years, you're obligé watch the news, or soirées débats, or anything, because no other expérience not gonna piss all t'énerver and much, même in time...
Him I déteste, it shows à every time, and...
No, no, go away...
And you can not watch them in the USA, CNN, Fox,... terrifiés Because they are so that you Getting bored so you zappes, they are condescending, and ça, information are présentées by 45 types.
Hi, I'm Ted, Bob, Ralph , Dick Dale, Nick, Will,...
And they arrêtent not change the angle of caméras:
"Hello, this is me, I'm à my office,
" Wendy and out from under the desk with météo financière. "
All ça, it's ridiculous.
The only chain to have information, that's when même BBC Radio 4 a great institution, but it's almost too much, while malgré.
Because you lèves, to 7-8 hours , you turn on your radio, and yet you find not your elbow...
And there's this John Humphreys which all interviews and it looks être up since à little près midnight à running in the halls of blaming guys you know, lying.
This is très aggressive dès the début, thou kindles and you as:
"Do not lie to me!
Do not lie to me!
" It's been 45 years since I ça, what am I, a débutant fucking? "
But because it's the BBC mélangent they all ça with a bunch of crap, it goes from ça jusqu'à "I'm with Jenny Murty,
" who speaks with a champion manufacturing haystack
"that his agency monté cleaning and publicité,
"it is the turn of Andrew, journalist policy to Parliament,
" you êtes là, Andrew, standing before Parliament, in shoes
"that's going on there?"
"So, there is bunch of guys who come out accusing
" other types of lie, but those accusés lie
"have released their own allégations,
" first accusers contré with a cons-cons charge,
"while an old guy, is believed to be judge,
" just announced that premières étaient accusations true,
"and all following échanges étaient entièrement false
" but he is même recherché in 87 countries, for lying
"à children and adults that had sélectionnés, just for training."
"And now, voilà John Peel:
" Hello Have you déjà léché the underside of a glaçon
"Well, Norman Worrington did, it is né in a bowl à Salisbury,
"tell us more, Norman..."
"I commencé lécher me by the knees, the à âge 5 years."
Let's go back John Humphreys:
"Où are the bombs?
!
Où? "Do I have a bomb?
And this parrot, là
" Lève yourself that I still pète mouth, enfoiré a liar! "
C'était très hard to follow all ça.
And to know what happens là there,
Et de savoir ce qui passe là-bas, à is difficult because of the language they use .
Lots of euphémismes like:
"The régime has changé." What exactly is it?
It looks like one of those things où they change the lives à télé, but for a whole country...
And the soldiers are là "Not yet, not yet.
" Wait, wait a little longer...
"Stay là, wait...
-"...
Now
- Oh, I love it
"The attacks, murder, is fantastic!
"It actually changes when expected of être torturé...
" Ah, it was ça too?
Oh, wonderful! "
And then there was this énorme wave of anti-américanisme, commencé when it all, especially... worldwide.
And sometimes... wait.
It became...
people will not pack badly, là above.
But when they showed they remained rational, well sûr.
They said: "We sûrs is not of this war,
"ça looks être motivé by cynicism, or a paranoid war,
"or a simple revenge.
It is not sûrs.
" Et .. and you êtes obèses. "
This is what happens to Iraq, all disputes emerge.
" This is what you êtes: obèses
"It is not as obèses ça, in Europe
" when you're big, this is because we have the caractère .
"We eat good fresh produce, pork with sauce on the farm,
" but you just êtes obèses fucking
" Because you fucking êtes not you eat of empêcher
"crap these chocolate ice 5 liter pot
" And you take too much space... "
And I'm ashamed to admit that I took part à là that game, too, for a week, I found myself à make tournée of cafés, à seek américain, à côté to smoke...
Because you know they will tell you something.
I have not done ça long...
But I had such trouvé once, était génial it, I détestais nothing to see, because he was eating eggs!
Eggs
I ask you!
même This is not a food!
It is no catégorie à
It's just farts enfermés in a substance...
So, I enfilé my little déj-'and I did my rot.
And he regardé as I knew he would do, and he told me:
"Excuse me, you go ça smoking?"
And I répondu "Uh... yeah.
" But I'm not the ; apprécier,
"I'll just use it to grill the next!"
The américains have répondu with an anti-européen, particulièrement against the français.
Donald Rumsfeld is one of their... leaders and he said he would not be dealing à old Europe, était it more intéressé by the new Europe, speaking of France and Germany who had voté against the war.
He wanted no old Europe, not of ancient civilizations, but most of the new.
And New Europe he meant countries like the Vulvonie, the Juvavovie... où tractors are nommés ministers, où and people make feasts around radiators boiled...
Countries not top- top, à but prêts do anything the américains say, espèrent one day because they see a picture of a pot confiote... étaient particulièrement anti-français with this picture low cheese eaters who go à 1ère the occasion.
But it's nice when même...
The américains restés are really on bloqués français of weak, sensual, that do all the time love.
They will not à war because they are still at stake à 2h of aprèm, with sheets froissés on the knees, étalés, à scratching, smoking a Gauloise in a Gypsy... sweating profusely,
before one of them out of bed to go in the kitchen, naked.
No, not naked.
Nude bust to feet...
To highlight their nudité.
crescent of the day before with their feet mouillés, trucidant paints the night before.
"What was I thinking?
"This is crap!
" My god!
"I can not believe I déteste my paintings, I hate them!
"I hate yours too!
-" You have my paintings?
- No, I hate them!
"Damn, why we must speak English?
"This is the copy, your work.
" You have copié mine, and Mine is the shit too!
"I'm bored in this workshop!
" Arrête!
Arrête any déchirer
"Find a thing for the small-déjeuner, I'm hungry!
"There is nothing, nothing at all.
We are poor!
"Let's make love plutôt than eating.
" No!
The things you make me...
"I'm exténué...
" Même my toes...
Leave me alone!
"Arrête, this is what you wanted...
" No!
Give me something à eat before I die! "There is nothing here, I've told you, à from bread to chocolate.
"You are of où, anyway?
" I do not know.
I névrosé, the farm! "
Bread with chocolate, it's like they start the ça journée...
And ça get worse from à là.
Until déjeuner, get baisé everyone you know... à J'étais récemment Paris, très they are good for pleasure,
J'étais à Paris récemment, ils sont très bons pour les plaisirs,
I passed a bakery, it's fun to go there and say même à.
I want rentré with an infant gâteau.
"Give me one of those guys chocolate," I said.
I was talking to someone on the street, he était rentré,
I bouffais a piece, I dû tell him to leave me alone!
This stuff!
dû I rent a room with...
"You are of où?
T'écoutes what kind of music?
Go!"
Pleasures sérieux what...
They know they will die.
Nobody will à the église.
You will die?
Do a damn good gâteau...
The thing that drives me crazy, with this war,
This is how religion has glissée it.
différences there among the great religions, and between small too.
I made my religious crisis, j'étais in a room hôtel ... I want to say, but I will say, très très bourré, I ate a Jésus chocolate, and has téléphone sonné, as I tried to choose one.
The protestisme, the prostestantisme...
Church of England, I never été attiré by ça, mostly because it is the basé thé .. ..
Catholicism offers more dramatic, dresses, types, candles, lumières the bizarre children, wine...
There are tricks that go on...
I speak as one of my comrades who did not été abusé...
I thought something was wrong with me .
I pointed it à école in the pants suit...
And then there are all these religions of the East people découvrent, as Zen, etc....
I always trouvées hard à pénétrer, the stories are dense.
The parables, métaphores while ça...
It says: "Two monks promènent is on a bridge,
" cherry blossoms fall all around ; them
"and one of them said," You know, I très thirst... "
" And the other répond "Yes, but I'm plutôt great..."
Quoi... ?
J'ai loupé un truc ?
différences, but I would say that if you believe, you are a beautiful asshole...
For me, it is just people talking about their imaginary friend...
All the time...
Someone who is not là...
- "You saw Cédric?
- No, no..."
It's not me dérange, anything that amuses them.
But some of them rule the world... which gives reason to inquiéter.
People will work, and everyone moves around:
"What we gonna do, sir?
There is a crisis, with its conséquences
" if we do not care right away, what do we do?
"It's okay, give me a moment, I return . "
"What we gonna do?
...
" I dunno, what do you want to do?
"I know not, and you?
" Kill them all.
Super. " When you are born in a Catholic country, you all the images of Jésus
and the whole gang...
All these paintings où guys to point fingers, there même that link outside the table...
Or they accuse all ... "He is..."
People are sensitive très...
And the stations of the cross, for années and années, these images gravées remain in you, you never forget them,
Jésus like going to buy the nails is arrêtant haircut,
s'arrêtant chez le coiffeur, paying bills before leaving, and all ça...
You never forget...
They say Jésus speak to you.
He parlé, but all he told me, c'était "Aïe!
Arrêtez!"
Bearing the vinegar and everything else:
"Barrez you!"
This is the préjugés, évidemment.
But I am full.
The préjugés.
People in inquiètent, now.
Not me.
I think it's needed.
It reminds you of who you are.
I have préjugés on gays, if someone tells me:
"I have gay friends." or "I do not know how to tell."
I would say:
"Yeah, big deal."
But I would aussitôt images tête
Je me dirais :
"Ouais, la belle affaire".
Mais aussitôt j'aurais des images en tête big guys with fringes séries carving of swans.
Bursting into tears in front of a beauté the pudding...
I can not get in empêcher, and I do not care...
But for a long time, I knew même that it did.
I have known much later, since we always used euphémismes.
J'étais in one of these homes.
était is a family of musicians, because we were doing sounds plutôt than talking about something.
"You have heard for Mary and John and Ding Dong. ..? "
" Apparently, all était a little... "
But sometimes, they used words for things précises well, could consider that idée était someone gay, had a sentence, but a little unlikely that you'd ever heard.
- "You know what they say about John?
- No, what?
"Well, apparently it is...
You know, he...
" Excuse me?
What are you talking?
I do... what?
"Well, you know... if I gotta explain... apparently
"he always picks twigs in spring...
" Oh yes...
"We always feared the hairdresser...
"It is toasté three côtés...
" What are you talking about? "
Everything vocabulary can être incredibly dérangeant.
Military use it all the time.
The régiments all have their own currency.
célèbre étant more than the SAS:
"Death before déshonneur"
"Death before déshonneur."
I've always demandé how to quantité déshonneur speaking, là
Because I can do with...
I could, for example, live with a Smurf,
before choosing death.
I would cuisinerais his omelette Smurf, I'd be super happy.
I wish we could over time.
Ca dérangerait me not...
I écouterais about his joyful language of Smurfs.
But all men does think qu'à smurf...
They do not say so, but it's true.
C ' ; is ça I'm là, for être honnête.
Just once, à ça what look like...
Nobody needs to know, you go for the weekend.
Just once, for all blue language...
And I never said à person, but...
And should Jésus être really boring, humanly.
Living à côté him...
A always speak in parables, même when t ' 're pressé.
"Jésus, do you want a lil last for the road, they'll close the bar,
" a lil background?
A bottle?
Something quick...
"There was a fox cooking an omelet...
" on a speedboat...
- "then he died...
- No, not yet.
" For once, if-you-please, Tell me something... "
Finally, all that nonsense, I...
I really prête more attention.
People...
Why do people have préjugés, this is because people are never agree with you, ever.
And this is là there a problème...
Because you have to go in disputes,
I do not like fights, men in either system master.
That's ça there are more men in the armée, because women would compete longer, stronger, there would be no more tears, more scène, and they come out of what they have to out, men évitent confrontation:
"No, I'm not, and it goes bad..."
les hommes évitent la confrontation :
"Non, je veux pas, et pis il va..."
United States, stories of snipers, these guys pulling insane on everyone.
And everybody does: "My god, he a gun, he kills people,
" it's horrible, how can this happen ? "
Ben déjà, you all have guns.
And they really a bunch of household ...
Like, say , Californian wine, which you can serve you to clean your toilet ...
Finally, I'm not good in violence.
If I am something, politically is libéral.
Because I'm afraid everyone!
J'étais à in a bar in London, there are some années, it was incredibly hot, like tonight.
J'étais à the terrace, and this woman has pointée.
An attractive woman très, she pointée.
It était an attractive façon that other women have said to her:
"Well, it is attractive, but it's too évident .. . "
From façon intéressante enough, women who say ça à tend to have so caché their attractivité... you have a mind of their swing a piece of bread...
But hey...
This young person énergique is arrivée, and I retrouvé à watch it.
I thought: "She is beautiful, beautiful être human..."
And I said, 'Do not mate, do not mate, it's rude.
But I am unable to turn around empêcher .
And while I watched, her boyfriend is out, être he was big, black, and extraordinarily beautiful.
Très handsome man, it was great enjambées, buriné a face, océan green eyes, à and a look of thousands of mètres.
An extraordinary person.
I could not lâcher the look of...
I complètement oublié its fiancée.
And then I've realized, I says:
"Do not mate, it's rude, he will think you look at him
" because it is a couple métisse, do not ça... "
So I regardé côté the other street, and is véridique, a skinhead avançait to me.
A nice guy too.
One such traditional skinheads.
And t ' ; to see much more.
Much like hunchbacks...
Où they all left?
I think there an island somewhere...
An authentic.
One of those guys who take their décisions with their necks.
With tatoos on teeth...
"Shit, it's going to détruire just because I'm alive...
"I can...
I can go anywhere!
" It will pass à côté me, say something horrible
"I déteste this situation, ça être is terrible, no, no!"
He rattrapé, they discuté, they étaient friends, they knew,
Il m'a rattrapé, ils ont discuté, ils étaient amis, ils se connaissaient, and I heard them say: "I espère that alcohol will not péter a cable..."
There are a lot of fear...
And I had my time with skinheads, there are some années, à London yet, and these three types, they go around in groups, because they have lots of information très à important to share...
One of them told me bousculé, voluntarily, a coup d'épaule, and I'm a rational guy.
Normally in this situation,
I'd like you: "I'm going home, give me a thé,
" and réfléchir à what I have done this type à,
"if he had été attaché... "
But too j'étais crevé and énervé, and I resté planté là, à watch them, and... they turned around.
We discuté...
They wanted to learn about façon espérais I breathe later.
Then I made an argument typically male,
I did my calculation, I thought :
"Well, you êtes three ... and I am one. "
And I'm terrible at math, in fact.
But, in record time, I calculé it would take at least three me for me...
défendre against third... one of them.
Même if attacked me with her ass...
I'm not a fighter...
I am a tapper more...
The best I can do is try to drown in my own blood.
If I was drowning myself not même.
I'm not so good... to charge me ça.
Fights...
I know même not swim.
I do not know driving.
I would learn récemment, and I thought:
"And if I was planting in a lake? "
There are a bunch of stuff that I not know how.
Because I say ça as man, because...
I am a man.
Ca, or when a woman who leaves really go...
It is not easy to être a man.
People have stuff médicaux à monitor, such as women.
There are things like testicular cancer , there is nothing funny.
Look for a size...
It may take a little time...
Parties génitales human are particulièrement horrbiles, when women été dessinées by god or équipe gay designers, or anyone in charge of ça...
C'était plutôt a beautiful journée.
Everyone était happy there was good wine, good food, everyone s'éclatait...
"Some weird stuff, something secret
" a cup holder...
Get me out ça...
And when they commencé à produce men, c'était project super late for Friday night.
And it ' était plutôt: "We stick a piece of stuff là...
"Oh, we oublié sex, ramène them,
" get me the remains of elbow à all the time...
"Génial, ça will do..."
That's ça that this is so déprimant à watch, a kind of bagpipe hairy...
And they say qu'après making love, there's a bit of mélancolie, ça called the "little death",
I'll tell you, après a romantic night à two, it was more a feeling étrange a "suicide raté"...
And I think that's largely dû à of the qualité matériel with which we must work...
This is really très désagréable à look... poiscaille would have bouffé ass after an hour...
What happens là below?
It wanted something fun, as a kitten tête or something like that...
You could tickle the chin jusqu'à this may have been tired...
But I want to spend my time talking à parts génitales, there are plenty of other people for ça do...
This scène, if it is not déjà fact has seen a représentation of The Vagina Monologues,
I look forward to see, since ça looks fabulously stupid.
Everyone knows that if a vagina could talk, ça exactly resemble à of Enya...
I will sit down a little, ça too long I'm standing.
I do not want généralisation grossière, on...
Women.
I am not for là ça, is vulgar...
But all I'm saying is that and they have no feelings...
Because in fact, it is men which are by far the most romantic .
You will hear men say:
"I trouvé someone...
It's amazing...
" If I spend my life with her, I'm niqué...
"I can not continue...
True, she changé my life...
"I have an apartment, a job...
It's nothing while ça...
" I could not stand it, I have être with it
"otherwise I'll end up in bed cloué, alcoholic, itchy pants...
" I could walk in the street. "
Now that's what women feel ... for shoes.
There are times...
You réalises à how it is unfair, the séparation gender in disputes.
Men and women should not être autorisés à argue.
mariés gay couples be disputed, it is good.
Même if they have their own problèmes, in couples mariés longstanding one of the other two said à:
"You'll pick up your jacket, it train all the time.
I put a little here. répond And another: "No.
Et l'autre répond : "Non.
- "Why?
- I'm a guy too, fuck off..."
And the typical vision of men on couples lesbians is that it can not be any problème.
There are always two or more breasts in the même pièce, that you ask for?
If an invoice is happening:
"Shit, how are we going to pay ça?"
And the other can "Can être, but look..."
We can not réaliser how men are with child sex.
They are the à kind make love because they hurt the tête à.
Or because they are in flames, or they shot in the tête...
But the disputes are unfairly balancées à the favor of women, because the arguments are in places fabriqués différents.
The arguments are male très années 70, période soviet monomaniacal, usés jusqu'à the rope...
They say the trick même again and again and again...
"I told you that I was going être late Tuesday,
"I told you that j'étais late I heard my own voice,
"I told you..."
While women seem to have these arguments façon bomber stratégique dessinés Jaguar .. .
sièges with leather and a crème poussée incredible.
C'est pour ça qu'elles peuvent répondre en disant :
"Yes, perhaps être.
But why the fridge door is open?
" I do not understand... "
There's a moment où , all men,
Women are so jealous, they want become one, sometimes, just to say the stuff they say.
à I asked a girlfriend with whom j'étais, a simple question:
"You have déjà mangé pheasant?"
This is live, huh?
This is concrete.
There is there need être said.
And she said something wonderful.
She said...
She has parlé.
And she said:
"Uh , not really... "
What ça mean?
In every sense.
You're in a bit sucé and hast jeté
Someone has put in your glass?
What has passé
In a car that goes really fast, one stroke language?
What?
And the other time, j'étais in a taxi, I paid the guy,
I went out and asking my evil foot.
J'étais posé wrong.
And I knew I was going to fall...
And I knew that would hurt ça.
C'était not of these falls quickly...
C'était more like:
"Oh, I think I'll fall... "
But c'était just a wink to her,
and she immediately sauté above to tell me:
"But what are you doing?
" Oh, I kill time, I picked mouth... "
"Oh, je tue le temps, je me ramasse la gueule..."
And I think men are très envious radar, the sensibilité that women have.
If a woman a friend of your wife, girlfriend one tells you:
"I'll see machine in the pub, I très back soon."
And it returns , you ask:
"How's Machine
" Oh, she is not so... so... not
"It makes diabète lean and she has an affair, and it is...
"compliqué.
" And it is likely she lost her job as...
"And you know everything ça in 5 minutes, she had time to tell you all ça
" Oh, no no.
She said nothing,
"but it has not finished her thé..."
sophistiqué slightly more male than conversations.
And règles très are simple:
It's your turn to speak when the guy in front has his glass à mouth...
And when he enlève, can être prêt.
And you have to talk arrêter.
But sûr well, neither knows what the other says, because you're drinking , and your tête fills with liquid...
That's ça that men who know the past 20-30 years, go home to see their wives, and when asked:
"How will Machin
" I know nothing... cum
- "But is ça 8:00 déjà!
- We had a drink, farm
être très hard harder... for women.
Is it physically.
You come to the world, you're a new-né, you walk towards the ; childhood if you're a girl, you're going to puberté, menstruation, après ça you walk towards the great adolescence and you can get pregnant, ça and a whole bunch of other événements,
and when you think it's over, there further changes, is like a opéra, masks fall, you say:
"Who am I?
I know.
None of you.
I tarée. "
If you're a guy, you are born, you have a finger in the collé pif, another on your pénis, and you grow up...
That's all...
And when you get older,
Nature Mère becomes quite cruel with everyone.
For men:
"They are red, large, and attirés by young women who do not want them." But for women, this is even harder, à some âge, there is a passage, children quitté home,
your husband is alive or dead .
Both are tough...
You have hair bulletproof, winters gets tough...
And you ask yourself questions.
Nature And Mère wonders:
"What can I do
" to give pep, the énergie .
How I can reinvigorate
"To give something to wait between life and death,
"Pour lui donner quelque chose pour patienter entre la vie et la mort,
"à which she often thought.
" I can do anything.
I did all my tricks , the box is empty. "I'm occupée let me.
I can not...
"Oh, yes.
Wait a minute.
A beard...
"voilà And, it's for you, chérie...
" Nothing.
This is the house that régale .. . "
And you're niquée, you still what?
Join a group of folk
Dublin Ladies and gentlemen, I amusé well,
I espère you too.
être Please come, good night.
Thank you.
That sucks of make believe we will go...
J'étais backstage à knees "Justify my childhood!"
This is pathétique...
This is the été, as some have noticed ...
C'est I'été, comme certains ont pu le remarquer...
Many of you will leave, and I just shot in England and a whole bunch of places, and it's crazy with accents as you hear people à of kilomètres.
très It is easy to recognize your fellow .
Some have accents that you empêchent of détendre.
The Cockney have été always a little hard, même if someone says something nice:
"You want a more thé?"
Do you think you're going to die...
The hard, in fact, is the emphasis Asturias.
Around London and into Essex, to the east.
This is really très étrange, ago not really bones, ça and everything sounds like: "No, I not think I'll take ça,
"I'll take another it is a little softer..."
If you bobbies on it, they explode live...
But, when the British leave, they recognize très easily they go to France, Spain, Italy, they blend into the landscape, you never know they are là...
They sit, appréciant atmosphere, the waitress saying à:
"How ça is not fucking chips
" I came by plane, my little.
" I have kids.
I censé do what with the fiasco of tomatoes
"What is... ?
Espèce of saleté of...
"Run away..."
Les Américains se reconnaissent aussi facilement.

You'll never say à à a américain:
"Excuse me?
You said ? "
With the Irish, there is a trick, a phénomène, you see ça où everywhere you go, à Los Angeles , Séoul à, à Tokyo... à Minsk, any où...
You see an Irishman, and you know, à due to phénomène, called "Irish Cup".
à ça It looks like... ça How are you?
You came alone, right?
là I am over 40 years.
J'économise for à back home...
But I can not really I know why...
Want something to drink?

That's it for me, thank you very much for être came.
Good night.

For a good cause...
Big, small, or millions of tiny

A beautiful Sunday, we're sitting here like idiots.
We should be playing golf.
Yeah.
How do you work a glue gun?
Oh, yeah, like I know how to work a glue gun.
Should we try going to a public course?
On a Sunday it'd be a long wait.
When do you think I'm gonna hear from the new club?
- Thursday.
- My interview went very well.
I thought mine went great too.
- It did?
- Yeah!
- Did you have the tall blond guy?
- Two guys.
- I think they took a shine to me.
- Took a shine to you?
- I really do.
- Okay.
I don't know what to do without golf.
When I'm done with this paper,
- I'm gonna wander the streets.
- Wow.
You wanna get the violin out?
- Get the violin out.
- That's pretty sad, yeah.
Another thing, I'd love to get to this Dodger game tomorrow night.
- I called everybody I know.
- You did?
- Yep.
Nothing.
- Nothing?
Everybody at Dodger Stadium, from top to bottom, nobody's got tickets.
It's gonna be some game.
I know.
I wanna go too.
It's too bad we got kicked out of that golf club.
Marty Funkhouser has two season tickets to the Dodgers.
His father just died.
He's probably not even going.
He hasn't even gone back to work yet.
So he's not gonna go to the game.
So what's gonna happen to those tickets?
They'll go to waste.
It is weird to ask a guy, you know his father just died,
- can we use your tickets?
- It is kind of tacky to do that.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Huh.
Still, I mean... it doesn't hurt to ask.
It might be a way to...
What do you do, just call him up and say, "Hey?"
"Marty, I know you're still in mourning..."
Right.
I'm sure you're still in...
"Marty, I know you're still in mourning, but is there any..."
"I feel your grief, but are you gonna use those tickets?"
"Marty, just so your tickets don't go to waste."
There's no good way to go about it, none.
Still...
You know every Sunday he has brunch over at Nat's.
Well, we gotta get some breakfast anyway, right?
We just say hello, we happen to run into him.
Let's get breakfast.
Maybe we'll run into him, say hello.
We'll feel it out, check him out.
Zip in, zip out, say hello.
If the subject of baseball comes up, it comes up, that's all.
Ah, see him?
See him?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's tougher than I thought, but hopefully
- in a few weeks, I'll feel better.
- Look at this!
- Hey, hey.
- Look-a here.
Look what's going on here.
Do me a favor, call me back and we'll play maybe.
Bye.
- Hey!
- How you doing, Lar?
Good to see you guys.
- I can't believe you come in here.
- I eat here all the time.
- I used to eat here with my dad.
- Oh...
- Yeah.
- I've never seen you guys here before.
We were talking about it, I thought I'd try it out.
- We were hungry.
- Yeah.
- It's great food.
- Yeah, what's good?
I always order the turkey.
Little turkey action today.
- Little turkey action today?
- Turkey today.
I just can't eat today.
I've lost five lbs.
in two days.
I have no appetite.
By the way, you know,
I'd just like to apologize again
- about the whole 5-wood incident and...
- It's forgotten.
- I hit the shit out of that club.
- I know you do.
You know that.
You've seen me hit that club.
- Let's not talk about the 5-wood.
- All right.
- You guys get into Beverly Park?
- Not yet.
We interviewed.
We're waiting to hear.
- Waiting to hear.
- Good luck.
- Great course, have you played it?
- Uh no, I'm a Jew.
Ah, funny.
Oh, hey, who do you like in the Dodger game tomorrow night?
It's gonna be tough, it should be a great game.
- Yeah.
- It's sold out.
It's a shame about your dad and all because, well, you're probably... just not up for going to the game, I guess, huh?
No, I decided I'm gonna go.
- No kidding?
- Good for you.
He would have wanted me to go.
- I think that's true.
- Mm-hmm.
- Don't you?
- He would have, most certainly.
Hey, if you're a little lonely, you need a little companionship at the game, if you want me to keep you company, I'd be happy to do it.
I don't have a seat for you.
- What about your dad's seat?
- It's spoken for.
- Okay, all right.
- Okay, well, you have a good time.
- Great seeing you guys.
- Turkey, gonna get the turkey.
- You're gonna love it.
- Good, thank you.
- Where are those seats anyway?
- Uh, they're third base, field level.
Hmm.
Okay.
Hey, you know what?
If you hear of anything...
Where am I gonna hear of anything?
Sometimes you hear that so-and-so's got an extra ticket.
- The game's tomorrow.
- Okay, well, if the person who you're taking might drop out, you know...
No dropping out.
The tip, remember the weatherman's tip?
The statute of limitations has gotta be up on that, no?
You're still asking about the golf tip?
Forget it.
Daddy-o!
Hey hey.
You, wearing that old "Seinfeld" jacket?
- Oh, this?
- Yeah, you're still wearing that thing?
I'm trying to get out of jury duty today.
I'd do it, but I'm in the middle of rehearsals for "The Producers."
That can help you get out of jury duty?
They hate people in the entertainment industry.
They don't want them serving, so I thought what the hell?
And they'll look at the "Seinfeld" jacket
- and throw you out?
- Yeah.
All right.
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, darling.
Hello, look who's here, my beautiful wife.
I know that girl from someplace.
She looks very familiar.
I'm glad I caught you.
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?
- I gotta go downtown.
- Oh, for jury duty.
It's hard to get out of these things.
I don't know what,
I'm gonna have to make something up.
I would serve if they made me the foreman, but...
Yeah, I don't think you get to choose.
I can't serve under another foreman.
That's not gonna work.
No, and then what are you doing?
I'm gonna go...
I guess I'll go to Jeff's house and watch the game.
Would you rather go to the game?
I got you tickets.
What, are you kidding me?
Where did you get these from?
You know what, I'm not gonna reveal my sources.
But just trust me, they're good.
I got you two tickets.
That's pretty high up in the alphabet.
- Okay, then, you know what...
- I'm just joking around.
- You wanna go with me?
- No no.
Go with Jeff.
I know you guys were working on tickets.
- That is so nice.
- Oh oh.
- Thank you, that's so nice of you.
- Well, you guys have fun.
Okay.
- You got a wonderful girl there.
- Yeah.
What are you doing, "TV Guide" crossword puzzle?
Yeah.
Tell you the truth,
I'm having so much trouble with the glaucoma, the pressure on the eyes...
All right, look, I've told you 10 times already.
- Let me get you some marijuana.
- No, come on.
- Try the marijuana.
- Again, marijuana.
Will you stop?
Do I look like some kind of beatnik?
I'm not gonna... with the marijuana.
What beatnik?
It's good for glaucoma...
make you feel better.
Medication is...
it's not working.
You take a couple of puffs, you'll feel better, so what?
Is that bad?
Why should you be in pain like that?
All right, will you stop nudging me about that, I...
Just do it.
If I get it, will you do it?
- Where you gonna get this?
- I have no idea.
You gonna go out on the street and pick up...
I don't know how I'm gonna get it, but I'm gonna get it for you, okay?
If you'll do it with me.
I'm not gonna have any, but you will.
- All right.
- I'll see you later.
All right, right.
Ms. Whitaker, have you ever served on a jury before?
No.
Have you ever been the victim of a crime?
No.
Is there any reason you can think of that you would not be able to decide this case
- in a fair and impartial manner?
- No.
- Okay, thank you for your time.
- Absolutely.
Moving on, Your Honor.
Could you state your name, sir?
- Larry David.
- Mr. David, I'm Counselor Condon.
Counselor Condon, nice to meet you.
Uh, have you ever served on a jury before?
No.
Have you ever been the victim of a serious crime?
My cousin once stole an Almond Joy from me.
It was upsetting at the time, but, um...
I don't think that would be considered a serious crime.
Is there any reason you can think of that you would not be able to decide this case in a fair and impartial manner?
I don't know if I could be impartial, Mr. Condon, given that the defendant is a Negro.
Problem?
Good afternoon, good afternoon.
Uh, I couldn't help but notice the, uh... the transaction between you and the... the other gentleman, and uh...
What exactly were you thinking of?
A little, uh, a little weed going, you know.
Some weed?
Yeah, I got it.
I got it, yeah, you know.
- First of all, calm down a little.
- Sure.
Just, you know, relax, just...
Yeah, no, I'm...
I'm...
Create the illusion that we're friends talking here, all right?
You kidding me?
You know what?
You're 100% right.
That's too much, all right, that, yeah.
Okay, you're doing fine.
Just chill out.
I can get you an ounce of, like, some real, you know, hydroponic scientific stuff, but that'll run you $500 bucks.
- Hydroponic?
- Yeah.
I'm not looking for a sound system, my friend.
- Hydroponic.
- You know what I mean?
Just looking to get my father a little... a little relief.
Let's play it safe.
I'll give you an ounce of schwag.
- Schwag?
- It'll cost you $200 bucks.
- An ounce of schwag, $200.
- $200.
Is that a fair price you're quoting me there, sir?
Look, you can pay me $200 bucks or go fuck yourself.
Okay, well...
Look, I don't need to sell the drugs, the drugs'll sell themselves.
- Sure.
- You know, forget it.
- No, let's do schwag.
Schwag.
- Just keep walking.
No, no, Schwag, $200, okay, I got it.
I got it.
So what do we do, what happens now?
- You got $200 on you?
- Yes, yes.
All right, take out the $200 bucks.
- I'll count to three, where is it?
- It's right here.
- Let me...
let me put my hand on it.
- Just give me your money, sir.
One... hold it.
You're not letting me put my hand...
Your hand is on it.
- All right.
- One, two, three.
- All right, now keep walking.
- Okay.
- Any particular direction?
- Just just just please move.
Which...?
Just walk, just walk, just walk.
Jesus Christ.
I gotta go this way.
Just go, just go.
What?
Oh, Jeff, you're not going to the game?
What are you kidding?
Oh my God.
No, it took me so long in court, now I can't even ask Cheryl to go.
Aw, you should see the traffic.
The only thing moving is the carpool lane.
I'll never make it.
I'm just gonna go home.
I'm not gonna use the carpool lane by myself.
'Cause I...
I don't want to.
That's the difference between you and me.
All right, goodbye.
Hey, Daddy.
You wanna date with Mama?
Get in the car.
- So, what's your name?
- Monena.
What you...
what you into today?
A little lollipop love?
A little digging for diamonds?
See, actually, I'm not really interested in any sex, per se.
Per... you one of them freaky motherfuckers or something?
To tell you the truth, what I'd like to do is I wanna go to Dodger Stadium and, uh, I wanna go to the game and I'll pay you for your time.
What?
Five hours it'll be.
You just want me to sit in the car?
Just sit in the car, that's all you have to do.
Oh, you a crazy son of a bitch.
All right, $1,000.
$1,000.
What, are you kidding me?
- That's, uh...
- $200 an hour?
Exactly, I can give four blowjobs an hour.
- Four blowjobs an hour?
- Yes, I'm good.
I drove a cab, used to drive around for two hours.
I couldn't get a fare.
You're getting four blowjobs in an hour?
Yes, honey, you done picked up the best.
Honey, I got a red snapper that talks to you.
You know what it's saying?
I'm charging way too much.
$750 and take me to the game.
I'm going to the game then.
I can't take you to the game, Monena.
I'm terribly sorry, I only have one ticket.
$750... you know this is not fair!
Listen, you're unhappy.
I'm unhappy too.
That's what a good compromise is all about.
Are you familiar with Henry Clay?
No, I don't know no Henry Clay.
What'd he say?
He was the Great Compromiser.
This is a good compromise.
- It is not a good compromise...
- A good compromise is when both parties are dissatisfied and I think that's what we have here.
Boy, look at this.
We are really zipping along here.
I'm gonna make this game.
- This is great.
- I thought you only had one ticket.
That's two tickets.
I'm meeting a friend there actually.
No, I'm gonna go to the game or you're gonna take me back to the corner or I'm gonna call my motherfucking pimp.
How 'bout that?
Yeah!
Yeah, I didn't think so.
Let's go to the game.
Ow, baseball!
I ain't never been to no baseball game.
This gonna be cute.
All right, well, pull... pull your thing up over there.
Make yourself presentable.
You know you're gonna have to feed me.
I want two hot dogs, a bag of peanuts and a milkshake.
- They got milkshakes?
- I don't know if they have milkshakes.
Hey, don't put your wallet away 'cause you know I'm gonna get hungry again.
- And that's...
- Stop talking for a second, would you?
I know the seats ain't way the fuck up here.
You got a problem with the seats?
You said we had good seats, club seats and shit.
We're way the fuck up.
Shit.
There are a lot worse things you could be doing.
- Whatever.
- Let's just watch the game.
Charge!
What you looking at?
My friend Marty Funkhouser sitting next to an empty seat.
He said he was taking somebody to the game.
Oh, I know you ain't looking around like you scared somebody gonna recognize you or some shit.
- Trying to act like you ain't with me?
- No, what are you saying?
- I will pull a titty out in this thing.
- Don't...
- I will pull a titty out...
- Don't you dare do that.
- Act like you with me then.
- I'm with you, I'm with you.
- I'm acting like I'm with you.
- Okay, cool.
- That's better like that.
I will...
- No, don't.
That's better.
Okay.
All right, yeah.
All right, yeah.
- Shit!
- Who are they?
Two guys who interviewed me for this golf club.
You know what?
I gotta get out of here.
- I'll be back.
- I'm not playing with you.
- You better come back.
- I'll come back, don't worry.
If I'm not back, I'll meet you at the car after the game.
What the fuck are you looking at?
Batting for the Atlanta Braves, the catcher, Javy Lopez.
Ball one, all right, three more of those and we force one in.
- Hey, Marty.
- Hey, Larry, I see you got a ticket.
Yeah, the seats really stink though.
- I-I'm sitting all the way up there.
- What can l...
Oh, there's a hit.
Oh, foul ball.
Hey, what a great game, huh?
- Is anybody sitting there?
- No.
- Can I join you?
- No.
Why not?
Well, uh, it's a seat for my father.
Your father's dead.
It's a memorial.
We used to go to games together.
It makes me feel close to him.
It's to honor him.
Oh, no!
Home run, yeah!
- Come on, Marty, let me sit there.
- I can't let you sit there.
- What, are you kidding?
- No, I'm not kidding.
- You're not gonna let me sit there?
- Not even for a minute!
Are you nuts?
Right fielder...
- Thanks, Marty.
- Gary Sheffield.
Thanks.
- Oh, you back fast.
- I told you I'd come back.
You did, you did.
There you go.
Now I bought us some popcorn.
You're a sport.
We gotta go out more often, really.
I gotta pay you back.
Yeah, you don't give a shit.
No, I...
If you're ever looking for a good blowjob at a reasonable rate... she's your gal.
That was good.
You got some big...
oh, you a pimp.
Larry, Larry, come here a minute please.
One second.
You're not gonna believe this, but my car won't start.
Oh my God.
What a shame.
It is.
Listen, I've gotta pick up someone at the airport.
And I know it's on the way.
Can you give me a lift, please?
Why don't you ask your father to help you jump start the car?
Hey, Leo, why don't you give him a push?
I'm sorry about the ballgame.
It was emotion.
Just give me a ride.
Let's not go through this, please.
There's one little problem.
I'm with a prostitute.
My eyes are closed.
I'll sit in the back, do what you want.
I didn't pick her up for sex.
I picked her up so I could use the diamond lane, so I can get to the stadium on time for the game.
I buy it.
Just give me a lift to the airport, please.
All right, I'll tell you what,
- I'll take you.
- Oh, that's so great.
But I want the weatherman's golf tip.
That's the only thing I can't do.
- Eh, your friend will take a cab.
- Okay, wait.
Done deal.
- Let's go.
- Okay...
- take your normal stance.
- All right.
Forget everything you've ever thought about golf.
Thanks a million for the ride.
I gotta go.
- I'm coming in with you.
- Nice meeting you, Winona.
- I'm gonna use the bathroom.
- How long you gonna be?
- I'll be two minutes.
- What if the security people come
- and tell me to move the car?
- Drive around.
Keep driving around and around.
You in overtime, this is some bullshit.
Hey, do me a favor,
Just hold on to my jacket when I use the bathroom.
Why don't you bring it in there?
Where am I gonna put it?
What if they don't have hooks?
It's not my marijuana!
I was just holding the jacket!
What are you doing?
This isn't even my jacket!
It doesn't even fit me!
Get your hands off of me!
Easy!
Get that dog away from me!
What took you so damn long?
Marty got arrested for marijuana.
- You're bullshitting.
- I'm not bullshitting.
I asked him to hold my jacket and there was marijuana in the pocket.
You had marijuana in your pocket?
I bought it for my father for his glaucoma.
I bought it this afternoon and I forgot, I completely forgot!
You don't need no damn marijuana.
I got the best shit in town.
You should have said some shit.
- Chronic.
- Put that down.
Are you crazy?
There's cops all over the place here.
That's some good shit right there.
- Chronic.
- This is schwag.
- What the fuck is schwag?
- Schwag.
- You don't even know what you bought.
- I bought fucking schwag, okay?
You don't even know what the fuck schwag is.
Have you ever bought it before?
- Huh?
- Schwag?
Yeah.
This is chronic, okay?
It's gonna clear your daddy's eyeball problem and shit.
We gonna hook Daddy up.
Put that on my motherfucking bill... that ain't free.
Okay?
- Okay?
- Got a little...
little problem.
"Little problem..."
I don't quite have enough cash to pay you tonight.
But I'm, you know, I'm totally good.
I'll pay you tomorrow.
I'll come to your house...
Tomorrow?
This ain't motherfucking pussy on layaway!
You better take your little trying-to-trick-a-bitch ass in there to the motherfucking A.T.M. machine.
I can't 'cause I went to the A.T.M. machine this morning.
I already took out $500.
There's a limit.
I am not fucking around with you.
You know how much money you owe me?
- I thought we were "cool de la."
- That's "cool de la" shit?
- I thought we're cool de la.
- You trying to be hip all and shit.
I'll tell you what I'll do with you, okay?
- What you gonna do?
- Okay, here's what I'll do.
We'll go to my father's house, get some cash, settle, everything clean, okay?
- I'm not going to your daddy's house.
- What's the big deal?
You're dragging me around all day and ain't paid me nothing.
I took you to a baseball game tonight.
None of that good shit.
We sat up in them fucked up seats way up there.
- Fucked up seats?
- You bought me one little hot dog.
Yeah yeah, which you proceeded to blow.
Hey.
- So late at night, for heaven's sake.
- What, I was at the game.
I was just about to go to bed.
- Did you watch the game?
- Nah, watch the game.
It's just so blurry I can't watch.
Um...
I got the stuff.
- Listen...
- This is it.
- That, uh...
- Huh?
- That's the stuff?
- I got it, okay?
Yeah.
- This is a joint.
- It's a reefer.
Yeah, absolutely.
You light it up.
You go like this.
Put it in your mouth...
- You gotta inhale.
- Hold it in your lungs.
Hold it inside.
And then...
- See how long I did that for?
- That's a long time.
- Not a cigarette where you're like...
- Oh, okay, so, um...
- I'm getting dizzy just from that.
- Yeah yeah, so...
- So you do that a couple of times...
- Yes yes.
and then turn the TV on and see what it looks like.
I'll leave this here.
- Do you have any cash?
- Yes, I got cash on me.
- What do you need?
- Hundreds.
No, I don't have that kind of cash.
- How much do you have?
- I got around $35-40.
Wait wait wait, let me put this away.
Wait, oh my God, don't-don't... don't answer.
- Hello.
- What are you doing?
- I'm coming in.
- No no...
I told you about putting me in...
- You always got me waiting in the car.
- I got it.
- I don't want you coming in here.
- I'm coming in there.
You tripping!
What's wrong with you?
Oh look at your cute little daddy, yeah.
- Uh, this is a friend of mine.
- Okay, hi!
This is Monena.
She's uh... a friend.
- That's your friend?
- We went to the game together.
She's a friend of Cheryl's.
Cheryl couldn't make it so I took Monena.
- So you went with another girl?
- No, it's Cheryl's friend.
Look, sweetie, we brought you a little eye medicine.
This your dad?
We gonna hook you right up.
Little Daddy got the little eye problem.
Look what we got for you.
Oh, that's a joint.
Yeah, this is a joint.
Very good, Daddy.
Chronic.
- I have a joint.
- That's very good, honey.
You want to go sit down and smoke it?
She's a lot of fun.
You two, you two go sit and smoke.
No no no, I want you to do it too, you know?
You have to do it too.
- Yeah!
- Uh, okay.
- Okay.
- All right, it's okay.
Come on, Daddy.
That's right, this is Bubonic Chronic.
This is real good for you.
Oh, good good!
No, no more, no more.
I want to tell you what this is.
- What is it?
- That's good shit.
You're crazy!
"That's some good shit!"
I wonder what it is to smoke bad shit.
- We're gonna do some Ebonics.
- Ebonics?
Just say this.
"Dis chronic is the shiznik."
Dis chronic is the shizmik.
- The shizmik!
- Shizmik.
- For shizzle my nizzle.
- For shizzle my... that sounds almost Yiddish to me.
Yiddish Ebonics.
Yeah yeah, you holding on too long.
Look at that.
He blew the scene.
Gei kucken ahfen yam.
Gei kucken ahfen yam.
How about "He's a meshuggener"?
- Me...
- "Meshuggener."
"Meshuggener?" What's that, Ebonics too?
What are you looking at?
You see something?
Huh?
What did I do?
You know what you did.
You did nothing!
If you want me to do something just tell me.
You gotta change the diet.
I told you about that.
I don't want the red meat.
You're eating the red meat.
I don't like that.
I'm doing the best I can.
Go to a doctor.
Get yourself a checkup.
Colonoscopy.
Are you afraid to get a colonoscopy?
What's the matter with you?
- I'm sorry.
- Everybody gets it.
Get a colonoscopy!
l-l...
I'm really gonna do it.
You know something?
You're a good human being.
Oh, thank you, Nat.
And you know, I love him too.
He is my boy.
Fucking faggot!
You got your father-in-law's birthday coming up.
You gonna get a card?
- Okay.
- You're not gonna get a card.
You're not gonna do a fuckin' thing!
I'll try and do better, I will.
TV TV TV, that's all you like to do!
- Read a fucking book!
- You're right, you know everything.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
- What happened to her?
- Making a phone call.
- She's a very nice girl.
- Oh, yeah.
You know something?
This stuff?
I can see.
- I swear to you, I'm not lying to you.
- Really?
You're coming through so crystal clear.
You're kidding me.
Really?
It's a miracle.
I swear to you it's a miracle.
- That's fantastic.
- All right, you ready to go?
Oh my God.
It's a hooker!
All you have to do, Larry, is get up there and tell the truth.
- Okay.
- That's it, okay.
- It wasn't your jacket.
- Just keep me out of this completely.
It was Larry's jacket, it was Larry's grass.
- He's on trial, I'm not.
- Right, it was your pot for your father's glaucoma.
You know, you could be a little more grateful.
- I did come and get you off the hook.
- Thanks a million.
Why didn't you tell me there was grass in the jacket?
- I didn't know there was grass in it.
- You didn't?
- You bought it.
- I forgot.
Guys, I just need you to be earnest.
The judge has to find you a credible witness.
Where is my jacket, by the way?
- I don't know.
- You were the last to wear it.
Who gives a shit about your jacket?
I'm sure you can get another one.
You know I know the way out.
Holy shit.
Oh, Mr. Baseball,
Mr. Owe-Monena-$200.
You said five hours and it was seven, honey.
You still owe me $200.
I want my 200 skrilla.
- Okay.
- This is your anniversary present?
No no, see, I was going to the ballgame...
I want my money, baby.
I need my skrilla.
- You got any cash?
- Maybe 20.
- You got any cash?
- I got nothing.
All rise for the Honorable Judge George Nagel.
Is that the judge?
- Yeah, that's him.
- Oh no.
Well, Mr. David, what do you have to say for yourself?
Well, you see, Your Honor, my father has this condition.
Will you stay here with me?
Let's find a place and settle down together
What are you thinking about?
Come on everybody!
Put your hands in the air!
Woo!
Woo!
Come on everybody now
The splendid float is going to take you to a never-ending paradise
A bright rainbow stretches across the sky
The roaming stage begins to fly
The neon lights flash and scream
Songs of passion, a beautiful dream
Go on, go on, follow that rainbow
Go on, go on, keep dancing to and fro
A butterfly flaps and flies up
It follows the rainbow you follow the rainbow
Go on, go on, keep dancing to and fro
Drunk now with the beauty of the world
Come on, come on let your dreams run wild
Come on, come on let your beauty shine
Come on, come on you're in paradise
Come on, come on don't try to close your eyes
Come on everybody!
Wandering with the wind
Wandering past your eyes of glitter
My licentious dance, my little jokes
Are only there to cover my weak heart
I'm drunk without drinking
Mad with this endless wandering
When our eyes flash blazing love's crazed insistence
I'm left bereft of all resistance
Covered in make-up, tiptoeing on stage
No one knows the pain I must face
Smiling and swallowing the tears
Secretly casting my sorrows to the sea
So boundless, so lost
On paths of life I just wander
Youthful fantasies, living dreams
But please don't let me be roused
Because here I'm the most beautiful around
Covered in make-up, tiptoeing on stage
No one knows the pain I must face
Smiling and swallowing the tears
Secretly casting my sorrows to the sea
So boundless, so lost
On our lives we just wander
Youthful fantasies, living dreams
But please don't let me be roused
Because here, I'm the most beautiful around
Hurry up or another company will beat us to the corpses
God damn it
Don't eat too fast or you'll break the bowl
Take it easy
Hurry up
Hey, your spirit banner
Your team is always so damn slow
Whatever.
It's not like the corpse can run away
Sunny.
You're back
Yep
Go ask those performers if they want anything to eat
OK
Sorry, can I borrow that hose for a minute?
Sure
Thanks
-Let me help
What is this?
Clam cakes
I'm so tired that that float almost freaked me out
OK, everyone, cheers!
Stop thinking about what's past...
How do you like the food?
It's really great
Is this your first time here?
- Yes
Your food is delicious
You're too kind.
Let me make a toast to you all
Wow.
What a warm hostess!
Come back and flatter me some more
Do you think we're strange?
No, I think you're liberated
Drunk and swimming in your memory
I don't care what the world says about me
Our love is already forever and true
The only thing burning in my heart is you
This feeling reminds me of swimming in the ocean
Where do you want to swim to?
Will you stay here with me?
I don't know
I can go back with you to the fishing village
Actually
I don't want to spend my whole life in a fishing village
We can find a place and settle down together
What are you thinking about?
Sorry everyone, I'm gonna go eat
Goddamn why isn't there another card for me
Why do I keep getting all the spades?
Go on and take it
-I'm so mad!
That's mine
It's going to rain soon
- How is it always yours?
It's raining now.
Who's white silk is that out there?
Go bring it in
Whose is it?
- It's Rose's of course
Go help her bring it in
Go on and get it for her
You lose and then you think you can order people around?
Where are Rose and Chubby?
Taking a break in front
What's up with them?
They didn't clean up after tonight's show
"Goodbye, from Sunny"
Flower petals scatter and fly free
Your back looks like a yellow rose as you leave
I need comfort but there's clearly no use
All I have is the slightest scent of you
Colors stream with the currents
But is it laughter or tears that flow?
Our past love, it felt so right
Our memory slumbers in a bed of delight
Love is like a dress-up party
Everyone loves my song and dance
I slip out all my beauty bared
But all I remember is that last look we shared
Stars speckle the sky
Beautiful streamers, I'll see you later
Life's joy and sorrow maybe we all get what's coming but I'm still willing to love perfectly, eternally
Stay and watch the sunrise
It'll be scary when the sun rises
After the sun comes up we'll all turn into demons
No way
We're not like you.
We're actually ancient demons
When the sun comes up we'll turn into wisps of smoke and vanish
Come on.
Stay a bit longer
- No, we should go
OK.
Hope you come back some day
- We will, we will
Of course we'll be back.
Don't miss us too much
Alright, let's go.
Bye!
Roy, the boss told me to give this to you
What is it?
A woman called looking for you this morning She said her son drowned in the ocean
and she wants you to help retrieve his spirit
Your uncle said he wants you to visit after you're done
You knew this woman's son, right?
Who?
Where?
Sunny Huang, in Keelung
How was I supposed to know to bring Sunny's clothes?
It's so hot out and you think I want to wear something extra?
You're so dumb.
Why the hell did you bring MY clothes?
Roy
Without Sunny's clothes, can we still retrieve his soul?
It's really important to have his clothes
But what happens if we don't?
Without them, he won't be able to find his way and he'll just keep roaming aimlessly
So he'd become a wandering ghost?
What the hell are you saying?
Stop talking nonsense
Instead of chicken eggs you brought chicken shit
Shut the hell up already, would you?
I told you to bring Sunny's clothes
And what did you do?
I give you a simple goddamn task and you just piss me off
So what should we do now that we don't have his clothes?
Mom, why is he taking all his clothes off?
That's Sunny's shirt
Why does he have Sunny's shirt on?
The soul passes into the void Pathless first and then moving towards the light Picking prayers and heading towards the Pure Land
The boundless sea extends in all directions
Wife and the living family of the dead now each call out three times
Since when did Sunny have a wife?
- Oh, Spirit, Come back
Sunny, come back!
- Come back!
Sunny, come back!
- Come back, my son!
Sunny, come back!
Sunny, come back!
- Come back, my son!
Sunny, come back!
- Sunny, come back!
Sunny, come back!
- Come back, my son!
Sunny, come back!
Sunny, come back!
Sunny, why would you leave me?
This is a game of love
If you want to play, go ahead and step right up
To play, you first must learn the rules
But please don't be sore if you lose
Some people laugh and let the past slide by
But others simply hide and cry cry cry
Love ain't got no principle
You should learn to just let it go
This is a game of love
If you want to play, just step right up
To play, you first must learn the rules
But don't be sore if you lose
What's up with Roy?
This guy is hopeless
He'll lose his job soon if he keeps on like this
Cheer up.
You're not going to starve
If not a priest, he can at least become a wailing funeral girl
Mama's back
Why are you so happy?
We've done so many shows, I just feel good
Oh yeah.
That funeral for Sunny...
How was it?
Mama, he vanished so mysteriously
Huh?
Didn't the police say it was an accident?
No it wasn't.
He left me like that on purpose
He didn't even tell me anything
It's alright.
Don't cry
It's OK
Don't cry
-It's OK
I've decided.
I want to see him
I want to find out what really happened
What?
I want to ask him what happened
What do you want to say?
I just want to know what happened
I don't know why he would leave me
He's already dead.
What's there to talk about?
Will he be a priest or a wailing girl today?
The wailing girl-priest is taking today off, Boss
Shut up and mind your own business
Always so slow
Fine
-The corpses will all be all gone already
Don't worry so much
Sis, I'm worried about Roy being teased so much
So I've not sent him to several ceremonies
But you know we're really short staffed
Why aren't you sending him to work?
You haven't seen him getting laughed at?
He cries even louder than the dead person's family
Roy has always cried a lot
It's different now.
He's totally over the top
Everyone's joking about him being a wailing girl
He can't be crying like that over some ordinary friend
He cries like he's mourning a lost lover
Hmmm
I'm wondering whether the rumors about him being gay are true
He's so effeminate
Sometimes he doesn't seem like a man at all This is such a mess
Doesn't seem like a man, huh?
- Nope
Now, do I seem like a man to you?
Hurry up already
Sunny's going in the ground tomorrow
Tonight's the last chance to see him
Why don't you want us to look pretty for Sunny?
Fine, fine
I'm not doing shifts any more with my dad
Alright
I can't wear this
This just isn't my style
Everyone dresses formal at times like this
You don't want to wear a bra, do you?
How do you know I wear one?
Hey, that hurts!
Be a little more gentle, would you?
Who taught you to talk like that?
I hope Sunny recognizes us
What the hell are you doing?
Stop acting cute!
I wasn't
-You're so gross
Ouch!
Stop playing with your hair
Don't be so femme
What's it matter?
But Sunny likes us femme girls
But he doesn't like you so stop playing with your hair
Stop fighting
Incense for prayers
Focus when you recite your prayers And don't mumble.
Who wants to hear you mumbling?
If you're going to be a priest, you better be dignified
And no crying afterwards
Do you hear me?
Sis, I've brought some friends to see Sunny
I've already helped make him up
I'm gonna go now
Feel free to go in by yourselves
I'm gonna take off
- Thanks
Since when was Sunny from the 1700s?
Sunny
Your family puts on such traditional funerals
Why do they make the corpses look so ugly?
Don't you think they made Sunny look really old?
I don't want to wear clothes like that when I die I'll look like my grandfather
Your whole funeral business is so traditional
They make everyone look so ancient
Tradition is just what it is.
There's a reason for it
What's the reason for it?
We live amidst tradition but still there's no place for people like us
Just look at you and Sunny, together for so long but what are you?
Just "ordinary friends"?
Who said we're just ordinary friends?
You know what our relationship was
But who's acknowledging your relationship?
It's not like you can just go and tell everyone that you're his widow and take his icon home with you
Come on
That's just how it is
Who knows what to think
Actually, I can split his soul and take an icon with me
What are you talking about
I know
I'll take an icon with me
Huh?
I wasn't being serious.
I didn't mean that
This is no good.
You shouldn't go back
Don't forget that I'm a Taoist priest
Rose, hold up
Rose
Rose, come on...
Don't.
They've already got an icon and it should go back to his place of birth I'm going to request one for me
But are you sure he wants to be with you
Why wouldn't he?
Sunny, I want to take an icon of you home
Will you come with me?
Both tails.
He says no
Sunny, do you want to come with me?
So you really wanted to leave me
Heads and tails!
He says yes!
He wants to go with you
Heads and tails.
Look!
Yes, yes
He says yes
Get up
Get up, come on
What did that last coin throw mean exactly?
It means that
Sunny said he wanted to be with Rose
But the question he answered "yes" to was about whether or not he wanted to leave Rose
Really?
Yes
Sunny, we're crossing the bridge
Hey Mama
I found out today that after we die we might get dressed up like ancient people
Ancient people?
Cool.
I'd look great as a classic beauty
No way
You'd have to wear a watermelon hat and tassel
You won't look like Sleeping Beauty
No kidding
What about Sunny?
He was dressed like a Qing dynasty bureaucrat
Really?
I felt really uncomfortable asking him anything with him looking like that
Yeah
Everyone, look at my beautiful skirt
But you can't wear it outside
Actually I really like wearing skirts
I like wearing skirts even more than you do
I also like wearing skirts but I can't get any in my size
You're all so mean.
I can't believe you're laughing
OK OK, I'll make you one sometime, alright?
Liar
-Alright, Mama will give you some money to buy some
You said it!
Mama will give you lots and lots of money
I'm gonna wear my secret weapon
Fake tits are the essence of drag queens
How to make them last forever?
And why do they have to come in pairs?
Hurry up and help me
Hold on a sec
Oh no, I put it on inside out
Hurry up
Watch out you demons
I'm a priestess who's come to cast you away
Don't let the sun rise
Help her change.
Don't wear that again
This is lame
Fine.
You go on stage dressed like that
Mama, can you stage a dance where I can dress like this?
Those Taoist robes look ridiculous.
My God, You're gonna be struck down some day you know
We're so noisy
Now for heels Take a look and tell me if my wig is all shaggy
It looks fine
Young and pretty
We should pray for Sunny today, and...
Hurry up
Come on.
How can you be so damn slow
Sunny
All of us sisters are here just for you
You're our only man tonight
And our show is special just for you
So you better enjoy it
You're so silly
What's with the puckered lips?
OK, my turn
Dear Sunny
Even though we're weird and flirty we're here for you together and hope you make it to heaven
Dear Sunny
I hope you spread the gay gospel up in heaven and bring us good luck down here on earth
What the hell?
You have no idea how to do this
You're just giggling and cracking jokes
That's not what it's about
We're here for our dearest Sunny
Please bless and protect us sisters and bring us good fortune and help us find good partners especially our own Rose
She's head over heels so you should take care of her
Help her get to where she should be and bless our performance troupe and bring us good business and lots of money
That's the way to do it
I covered all the bases
What's up?
What's wrong?
Aren't you happy now that you've brought Sunny here?
Why are you crying again?
Don't cry Rose
It's nothing
I'm just really happy that Sunny is here with all of us
If you're happy, how can you look so sad?
You should be smiling
Come on, you can do it
That's right.
If everyone is crying
Sunny will get freaked out
Right?
That's right.
Sunny liked smiling
Yeah
Our smiles will help Sunny's soul find its way
And it's more his style anyway, right?
Let's smile
Faster, faster
Mama
Don't I look like Kate Winslet right now?
Yeah right.
More like Kathy Bates.
Go on
I'm so beautiful
-Alright, go on now
Hurry up everyone
I feel so high
You're back
This time
Don't leave me any yellow roses
Everyone over here, let me hear you
Woo, woo!
Over here now, over here
And in the back now
Everyone now
Come on everybody
The splendid float is gonna take you to a never-ending paradise
Wandering with the wind
Wandering past your eyes of glitter
My licentious dance, my little jokes
Are only there to cover my weak heart
I'm drunk without drinking
Fluttering along your trail
Eyes flash blazing love's crazed insistence
I'm left bereft of all resistance
Covered in make-up, tiptoeing on stage
No one knows the pain I must face
Smiling and swallowing the tears
Secretly casting my sorrows to the sea
So boundless, so lost
On paths of life I just wander
Youthful fantasies, living dreams
But please don't let me be roused
Because here, I'm the most beautiful around
Wandering with the wind
Wandering past your eyes of glitter
My licentious dance, my little jokes
Are only there to cover my weak heart
I'm drunk without drinking
Mad with this endless wandering
Eyes flash blazing love's crazed insistence
I'm left bereft of all resistance
Covered in make-up, tiptoeing on stage
Smiling and swallowing the tears
Secretly casting my sorrows to the sea
So boundless, so lost
On paths of life I just wander
Youthful fantasies, living dreams
But please don't let me be roused
Because here, I'm the most beautiful around
Covered in make-up, tiptoeing on stage
No one knows the pain I must face
Smiling and swallowing the tears
Secretly casting my sorrows to the sea
So boundless, so lost
Rose
Sunny
Love ain't got no principle
You should learn to just let it go
No one knows the pain I must face
Aye, life is short
Beyond life and death there's fate
Beyond rich and poor and permanence
Burn paper money now
Burn money to pay the way
Burn money for the road
Walk, walk
Walk on the red earth
Walk on the red earth
Now take the road on horseback
The horse will take your soul all the way West to heaven
Burn money for the red road
My Auntie always says that this soul guiding ritual marks the last dance of life
After this ritual is done
Life truly becomes death
Don't be bedeviled by evil spirits
Burn money for the journey over the black road
Burn money now
Burn money to pay the way
Burn money for the road
Ride, ride
Ride up to the pebbly way
The pebbles are sharp
The horse tiptoes across the pebbles
Let's go
Let's saddle up and get Rose
Your make-up is gorgeous but what's with the beard?
Can it get any worse?
Hold on
A bearded lady?
Please
I forgot
Hey, sis
You're back
This graveyard is just a riot of color
I couldn't see where you were
Hurry up
Alright, I'm hurrying
What about hair?
Where are your feathers?
Look at you.
You're not wearing any!
What about you, Mama?
Mama, where's your hair?
My hair
Aiya, I'm not wearing any!
But did that fact keep you from whining about everyone else?
I had someone make this.
How does it look?
Beautiful
-Good
It's on right, right?
This was specially made
Be lighter
Why'd you stick this in there?
Now it'll be a little tighter
You just stuck me in the head
Fine, it looks good now
A bit tighter would be better
It shouldn't fall out
Hello hello
Test test
Test Test
Hello Hello 1234
Hello hello woman seeks man
Hello hello
Mic check
Hello 1234
Let's scare the kids
Hello hello
Mic check mic check
Hello hello
The splendid float is going to take you to a never-ending paradise
So this is where you've been
Look
We set up our float just for you
You can come join us and we can travel together
We can go wherever you want to go
Sound good?
Loving you is a decision I'll never regret
I knew I could stay with you forever from the moment we met
True love can strike electricity to the heart
Let me recreate that on my fabulous float
For you, I'd climb upon a phoenix's wing and fly to heaven to give myself as an offering
Since I know that I'm your one I'd even risk getting burned up by the sun
The flames would be gorgeous and bright
Shining like a rainbow's light
My love, life is a play of joy and sorrow wrapped in fate
Let us sisters send you off
For you we've raised our courage our love
Through life and death and even hell
Through life and death and even hell
Through life and death and even hell
I've fallen for you
Sunny
All us sisters are here now and we're gonna perform just for you
Sunny, I hope you're spreading the gay gospel up in heaven and bringing us good luck here on earth
Our dearest Sunny
Please bless and protect us sisters and bring us good luck especially our Rose
Will you stay here with me?
I don't know
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently...
until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate, life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
A cursed parakeet?
!
Well, all his past owners had terrible things happen and died.
Are you serious?
That's bad!
Do you want him, Shigeo?
Not after you tell me that!
Why don't you go dump him someplace?
But... that's cruel!
How about you, Chad?
He's cute, y'know?
Stupid, stop it!
Chad has a weakness for cute things like...
Wha...?
!
We shall continue to devour...
In order to fill the emptiness of our existence, we must continue to devour.
A Soul Reaper's soul is exceptionally delicious...
Once you taste it, you always crave it.
C-Chad!
A-Are you all right, Chad?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Fine?
!
You're bleeding!
Thank you for saving me.
Huh?
My name is Yuichi Shibata.
What's yours?
W-What the hell?
!
It's like it understood what just happened!
This parakeet is cursed!
What's your name, Mister?
Yasutora Sado.
I'm 15 years old... still.
Hey!
Chad is interested in it!
Geez...
I can't believe my injuries healed in a day.
Surprised?
I was among the best in my Kido class.
That was easy.
Kido class?
So what?
Soul Reapers go to school?
Huh?
Well yes...
But Ichigo...
How do you drink this?
Huh?
You just poke a straw in it and drink.
Straw?
Hey, you're together again.
Huh?
You guys are quite close, huh?
Mizuiro...
Fool!
Do we look like friends?
Am I wrong?
Oh well, if you say so.
But Ichigo, you should be more aware of what people will think.
Stupid, if I cared about what people thought,
I'd have dyed my hair black.
That's true.
So this is it!
But where do I poke this?
Hello Kuchiki!
Huh?
Helloo!
Err...
Kojima.
Right!
I haven't introduced myself yet.
I'm Mizuiro Kojima, age 15.
I like...
Picking up girls.
Huh?
No way!
That's mean!
He looks like a dork, but he's a real flirt.
Watch out for him.
Stop it!
You'll ruin my reputation!
Besides, I'm only interested in older women.
That's why she has to be careful.
Huh?
Never mind.
What's this?
!
There's the beautiful new transfer, Kuchiki!
What are you doing here?
!
Ichigo lured her here.
No way!
What?
!
Ichigo, why you!
Good job!
T-Thanks.
You're so happy you're crying?
I'm so glad you've come, Captain!
To this garden of masculinity!
Hello.
Awright, everyone!
We're partying it up during lunch!
With milk coffee and yakisoba bread?
Shut up!
It's the spirit that counts!
And Kuchiki...
If you're ever in need, don't hesitate to come to me!
Really?
Of course!
Oh, Chad...
Mmm...
Are you injured?
Hey yeah, what happened?
A steel beam fell on my head yesterday.
A steel beam?
!
As for my hand, I had a collision with a motorcycle.
And the rider got hurt bad...
so I just carried him to the hospital.
N-No wonder you were late.
But geez, what is your body made of?
Huh?
What's with the bird?
Hello, my name is Yuichi Shibata.
What's your name?
Hey, this is amazing!
It really talks!
My name is Keigo Asano.
Can you say that?
Chad, where'd you get the bird?
Yesterday.
Someone gave it to me.
Hold it!
You were just about to tell us, but got lazy and cut it short, didn't you?
!
That's a bad habit you have.
Now, explain!
I didn't cut it short.
Oh yes you did!
Listen you...
Don't worry.
Huh?
There's definitely something in that bird, but it's not evil.
It's probably a lonely spirit.
But we cannot leave it alone.
We should perform a Konso tonight.
Got it.
Another sleepless night.
Don't complain.
Yeah-yeah...
Still...
He sensed a spirit and worried about the safety of the others...
Perhaps he's beginning to understand understand what it means to be a Soul Reaper.
Here.
Thanks.
It was during 8th grade...
Huh?
...when I first met Chad.
Back then, my hair color got people's attention and got me into fights.
It was when I got into this little scrape.
Who the hell are you?
!
Die!
Chad never fights back, no matter how much people goad him.
He's an odd one.
Yeah.
This juice is good.
Yeah?
I'm home!
Kurosaki Clinic Internal Medicine
- Pediatrics Outta the way!
Move!
Huh?
What's the matter, Karin?
What's your hurry?
H-Hi Brother!
What's going on?
An accident!
There was a car accident at the intersection.
Car accident?
You won't take him?
Do something!
There are patients who need more than our first-aid level of treatment!
Now listen!
Tell your director it's a request from Kurosaki!
Then you'll find some free beds!
Understand?
!
Dad...
Damn useless people!
Anything I can do to help?
No!
Get back in some corner and stay outta the way!
Dad, one more patient!
Huh?
Man, he's a big one.
Ichigo, come here and get to work!
Oh, yeah.
Huh?
Chad!
Oh, that's a terrible wound!
This is bad!
It looks like a burn.
What hit you?
This feeling...
You'll have to take it easy for awhile.
No.
Huh?
I'm... okay now.
Don't be ridiculous!
There's no way you're fine after losing so much blood!
You see?
Yuzu!
Karin!
Get a bed ready.
Yes!
Let's get you to bed, okay?
Did you feel it?
Of course.
I felt it even in here.
I didn't sense anything from the parakeet.
But his injury... smelled of Hollow.
Kurosaki Clinic Internal Medicine
- Pediatrics
'Morning!
Brother, breakfast is ready.
Where's Karin?
She didn't want breakfast.
I don't think she feels well.
Her?
Not feeling well?
That's unusual.
Ichigo!
Bad news!
Chad has disappeared from his room!
Ichigo!
Rukia!
Well?
Any clues about where he went?
No, how about you?
No luck either.
There's no news at the Soul Society about a Hollow.
I can't find anything on the radar either.
Usually, Hollows hide themselves between this world and the Soul Society, except when they commit foul deeds.
Even if Hollows are after Chad, we won't be able to get the location unless they show themselves in this world.
Got it?
You expect me to understand with those kindergarten drawings?
A Hollow is targeting Chad.
It'll be too late if we wait until he's attacked!
There has to be something!
That's right!
The parakeet Chad had!
We just have to follow the soul that possessed it!
That's not possible!
All right...
Ichi... go?
What's this sensation?
Mister... you're nice.
Hmm?
I need to apologize to you, Mister.
To be honest, everyone who owns me gets bad luck.
Yes, I know.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
I...
Don't worry about it.
So Mister, forget about me...
and abandon me.
Mister...
I can't do that.
Ichi... go...
I must tell him...
How can this be?
It's such a weak soul, even I cannot sense its presence.
And he's trying to find it from this distance?
This is?
I found him!
This way!
Those were...
Spirit Ribbons, visible rays of spiritual energy.
Only high level Soul Reapers are able to see them.
Has he progressed that much in this short time?
I guess we lost him.
Mister, you don't have to do this anymore.
It's all right, I don't mind.
Being tough is my one good trait.
Watch out!
He found us!
Let's get away!
Mister...
Don't worry.
This is nothing.
There!
It's Chad!
That idiot!
Why's he running?
!
It's dangerous alone!
Ichigo!
Karin!
What're you doing?
You're still so weak!
Karin!
Ichigo!
Take her home first.
I'll go and save him.
What're you saying?
!
I can't!
Don't complain!
If you leave her there and go, you'll be distracted when you fight the Hollow.
I can't have that.
Understand?
Now go!
Rukia!
You... haven't gotten enough of your powers back to fight a Hollow.
Don't take chances.
Fool.
There's no way I'd make you worry by messing up.
See you!
Yeah!
Are you all right, Karin?
Hang on!
This isn't like you!
Ichigo...
I... saw it...
Last night... the memories of the spirit that possessed the parakeet.
I think it's because I was the closest in age.
The strongest memory that remains in that child's mind.
It came flowing into me.
That child...
His mother was killed right before his very eyes!
Please...
Ichigo!
Please... save... that child!
Please!
Dammit!
I can't overtake them!
If I were not in this gigai, it would be easy.
Why is it that the physical powers of a gigai are the same as for an average human being?
!
Those dolts at the technology development bureau!
No...
I'm starting to run out of breath!
What a nice smell!
You smell delicious!
Let me devour... that soul of yours!
Hmm...
You won't die in just one shot?
And it seems you can see me, huh?
Just... who are you?
!
The one who reigns!
Mask of flesh, all creation flap of wings... the one who carries the title of human!
In the name of truth and temperance, dig your claws into the wall of sinless dreams!
Destruction Spell 33...
Pale Fire Crash!
It worked!
Good, at least this much of my powers are back.
What was that noise?
She's being attacked.
The lady who was after us earlier is being attacked by the one who is after us!
Y-You...
Stay here.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to save her.
No, you can't!
It's too dangerous!
No, I don't mean I'm in danger of being hit by a car if you leave me in the road!
No, Mister...
You can't see ghosts!
No!
He'll get you!
Wait!
Mister!
Mister!
Ridiculous!
It didn't even scratch him!
Hah!
I know that trick!
It's a Soul Reaper spell, right?
But yours is so weak.
I felt nothing.
Dammit!
As I thought, my Kido hasn't recovered enough to use a spell of that level.
I get it, you're a Soul Reaper.
No wonder you smell so yummy.
A Soul Reaper, huh?
How nice!
I've devoured two Soul Reapers who tried to help that kid pass over.
They were delicious!
By kid, do you mean the spirit inside that parakeet?
Yes.
It seems you keep chasing after that soul.
Why is that?
!
Well, if you'll let me eat you without resisting, I'll tell you.
Why you...!
Hey...
Tell him...
That if he passes over, he'll be able to see his mother.
Tell that boy...
Don't let that boy be all alone anymore.
Please Ichigo...
Though the voyage must continue on
May seas always be calm
When the cycle of the moon has renewed may it shine
It's light to guide your boat
I offer this voyage a prayer
With each new day that still awaits
On vividly shining seas
To the end of the journey
Urahara Shop, where Soul Reapers often visit...
Urahara Kisuke, the shop owner who carries a dangerous scent on him...
And the thing that is taken out of the store invites another tragedy...
That preview is one week too early!
Besides, the story isn't that sad...
Oh no, we're out of time again!
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently...
Until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate, life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
What happened?
!
Hey Ganju!
I-I'm sorry, Sis...
I just showed him once.
I never imagined it would turn out like this!
Huh?
!
I did it!
You did it, Kurosaki!
Yeah!
You idiot!
Don't lose concentration!
Huh?
Weren't you listening to me, idiot?
!
If you lose concentration, you'll blow up!
Didn't I tell you that?
Yes, you did.
That's right!
I tell you, you're!
You're just as guilty, idiot!
Both of you, no food tonight!
Why put me together with him?
!
Shut up!
Got any complaints?
!
Yoruichi...?
So, Ichigo has finally completed a Cannonball?
Huh...?
What's wrong?
Nothing to worry about.
He's only sleeping.
Now, I want you all to sit over there.
Ichigo is asleep, but we haven't got much time.
I want to talk to you about what you can expect after we invade the Seireitei.
You must!
Practice hall
Fate of three sparrows, fate of four dragons...
Blocked in from five directions, unable to return six miles,
Wind of the Heavens,
Orangutan, Spoons, Cane of elm...
A thousand sprinkles of ash, a thousand bits...
Of wisdom...
S-Silvervine?
!
What...
What the heck was I dreaming about?
How should I know?
!
I sure slept well...or, did I?
What am I doing sleeping here?
"How should I know?" I said.
Idiot!
What the heck are you doing, anyway?
It's none of your business!
Get lost, will you, dandelion?
!
What?
!
So, you're finally up.
It's time for us to leave.
Huh?
Leave...?
Okay, so you're all here?
Yes, sir.
Huh?
Yoruichi, your tail looks like one of those flexible toothbrushes!
- Oh...!
- Huh?
!
What?
Do you have a problem with it?
N-No.
It's a beautiful tail, as always...
Don't you remember?
!
You're responsible for that!
Huh?
Me?
We...
It took the three of us...
To finally get you to let go, but...
Ooh...
My tail...the tail I was so proud of...
You'd be smart to stay away from that subject!
G-Got it...
Hey!
What happened to Ganju?
Huh?
I dunno...
He was muttering about something downstairs.
Hold it!
The hero always arrives last.
What's with that getup?
It's my very own battle costume.
Don't I look cool?
Cry and beg all you want, but I won't lend it to you.
How do you like that?
Battle costume?
What's it for, if you're just seeing us off?
A Soul Reaper killed my big brother.
Ganju!
Why you...!
Just shut up and listen, Sis!
My brother...was a genius.
He managed to pass the Soul Reaper Academy entrance exam in one try.
At that time, his spiritual power was at Level 6.
That's the same level as a lieutenant of the 13 Court Guarding Squads.
Then, he finished six years' curriculum in one, and he became a member of a Squad.
In just five years, he became a lieutenant.
But my brother was killed... betrayed by his Soul Reaper comrades!
I was still a kid back then, so I don't remember the details, but there are two things I'll never forget.
Their faces...!
Two faces!
The ogre like face of that Soul Reaper who dragged my badly injured and dying brother home.
And the face of my brother as he happily gave thanks to that Soul Reaper.
Why did my brother do that?
Why did he seem so happy?
To this day, I don't know.
But there's one thing I can say...
My brother didn't blame Soul Reapers.
He didn't hate them.
I never knew he had such a painful experience.
Why?
!
Why didn't my brother despise Soul Reapers?
!
Why did he continue to trust in the Soul Reapers?
You're not like the other Soul Reapers.
I owe her...
She saved my life.
And I haven't repaid her yet.
I don't want to turn into a pitiful guy who'd turn his back on her.
I have a feeling.
If I go with you, I might discover something.
That's what I think.
That's why I'm gonna help you.
I'll go as far as I can, to see what a Soul Reaper is really like!
Ganju...
Y-You're really something, Big Bro!
Ganju...
You've grown up fine!
Humph!
Looks like you've made up your mind.
Looks like I work with you.
Damn you...
Everyone...
are you ready for the Cannonball?
Yes!
Huh?
By the way...
Huh?
Yoruichi, can you make the Cannonball?
Huh?
I wonder...
Let me try it.
Don't tell me...
this is your first try?
Well, put that down there.
Humph!
Something like this is as simple as breathing in and out.
Wow!
It took us so long to learn to do it!
Do you resent it?
Do you resent that I could easily do something that gave you so much trouble to accomplish?
Huh?
Ganju.
Were you able to master it?
I guess...
Then we'll go with Flower Crane Cannon Launch Method Two.
Can you handle it?
Sure!
Don't you chicken out and run off in the middle of it now, damn brat.
Sis...
If you're gonna go, you've got to put your life on the line.
Y-Yes!
Are you ready?
!
There'll be no more delays, you brats!
Now, get in there!
The sun will be rising soon.
That will be the signal to begin the launching ceremony.
Listen...
Once we're in the Seireitei, we have to stick together.
If you encounter any Captains, don't think, just run.
Our goal is to save Rukia, and nothing else.
Don't, by any means, take any useless risks!
In the distance!
Copper hued greed desires 36 degrees of dominance!
It has begun!
Pour in your spiritual energies!
72 pairs of illusions, 13 pairs of horns,
The monkey's right paw captures a star!
Held in the embrace of 25 suns, the cradle of sand will flow with blood!
Flower Crane Cannon Launch Method Two!
Kagizaki!
You have done it, Lady Kukaku!
It's a success!
Go with care...
Ganju.
Ohh...!
There wasn't as much of a shock as I expected.
Idiot...
It's only the beginning.
Huh?
Huh?
What's that?
It's the next part!
The Flower Crane Cannon Launch Method Two involves two steps.
The First Spell controls everything from the launch to the directional setting.
The Secondary Spell that controls the acceleration and axis adjustment.
After that, you gradually improve the accuracy!
Oh...
Don't get in the way if you want to get there safely.
Uh...
Sure!
There's something I want to tell you all.
In order to enter the Seireitei, we have to stabilize this cannonball.
We must keep the spiritual energy output by each person at a constant level.
To do that, if you keep your hand on this thing, you'll be able to see how much energy the others are releasing.
I want you to adjust your energy release accordingly.
- Right.
- Okay.
One mistake and it'll be the end.
I'm counting on you!
I understand.
Yes.
Flower Crane Cannon Launch Method Two!
Secondary Spell!
Fate of three sparrows, fate of four dragons,
Blocked in from five directions, unable to return six miles,
Wind of the heavens,
Orangutan.
Spoons, Cane of elm...
K-Kurosaki...
You're releasing a little too much!
A-Am I?
S-Sorry.
Kurosaki!
Lower it some more!
I-I know!
I've lowered it a lot already!
Ichigo...
I said I know!
A thousand sprinkles of ash, a thousand bits of wisdom...
- The measure of white clouds...
- Ichigo!
- Approaching the great darkness,
- I said I know!
- Not stepping on scarlet shadows...
- I'm turning it down now.
Hold on!
A thousand sprinkles of ashes, a thousand bits of wisdom?
!
You idiot!
You made me read the same line twice!
So what?
!
Is that supposed to be my fault too?
You're making so much noise flapping that trap of yours that I lost my concentration, you numbskull!
Stop it, Ichigo!
Ganju...
This is no time to be doing that, is it?
She's right.
Stop it!
Stop it, I said!
Stop it, both of you!
Hey...
Outside...
It's Seireitei!
What's that?
!
Urgent alert!
Urgent alert!
Intruders in Seireitei!
All Squads get into position!
Repeat!
- Urgent alert!
Urgent alert!
- Intruders?
- Could it be those Ryoka?
- Intruders in Seireitei!
Intruders in Seireitei!
All Squads get into position!
Hey!
Wait, Kenpachi!
Ken-chan...!
Yachiru!
What is it?
The enemy?
You're going to kill them?
Yeah.
It's the Ryoka!
I don't know how, but it's someone who fought against Ichimaru and survived!
I want to fight him!
There is no choice...
This meeting of Squad Captains is dismissed for now.
I shall inform you later how Ichimaru will be dealt with.
All Squads will report immediately to their battle stations!
The warning certainly came...
At a good time for you.
I don't understand very well...
What you're trying to say.
You think you can get away with it?
You'd better not...take me too lightly.
W-What is that?
!
I doubt it will be able to get through the Soul Shield Membrane...
I'll order everyone to draw back, just in case!
I-It's coming this way!
Get out of here!
We're going to crash!
We have no choice!
Everyone, pour in all the spiritual energy you've got!
It crashed!
It ran into the Shield and stopped!
To crash there and not be destroyed...
Could it be a body of spiritual power of such great concentration?
Come on...!
W-What's going on?
!
We got through the shield all right...
But why aren't we falling to the ground?
Don't get seperated!
The Cannonball dissolved when it hit the shield and it's only temporarily holding us up!
That means...
It will eventually create a whirlpool, then explode and vanish.
Oh!
If we are separated at that time, we will be blown apart by the shock!
- Wha?
!
- Ohh!
It's begun!
Ohhh!
Damn...!
I'm not gonna get...
Blown away!
Don't come near me!
Go away, if you don't like it!
Will you two cut it out?
!
Grab onto whoever is nearest to you!
Don't let go, no matter what!
Damn it!
What do you mean by that?
!
Let me sit on your shoulder.
Yoruichi!
Ishida...!
Chad...?
!
Chad...?
!
Chad...!
Chad!
C-Chad!
Don't worry.
He will surely survive!
But if you want to be able to search for him down there, you must consider your own safety first!
Damn it...!
Ichigo...!
Inoue...!
Damn...
They split up into four!
Which one is it?
The strongest one...
Which one is it?
!
With much appreciation send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
I'll always be grateful for who you are.
I was casually walking through town
Around the time dusk fell and the city was bathed in red
It was an afternoon with crowds of people coming and going
I don't know why but I just stood there and watched
Then my cell phone started to vibrate and I made myself move hoping it could fill in this hole in my heart
You're not alone You see, everybody
We gotta hold each other up
With much appreciation
I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
I'll always be grateful for who you are.
What's going on?
!
I'll go and take a look.
But my Zabimaru is gone!
Do you know where it is, Hinamori?
I think someone was using it to slice some pickled radish.
Roar, Zabimaru!
Chop up that radish!
Hasn't your character changed a lot, recently?
Pain that won't heal
Sadness you feel
Scars that just refuse to fade from memory
Sometimes the burden's too much for one to bear
Don't give up on me, please don't turn me away
Whoa!
I'll hold your hand in mine
Will I lose my hold on her someday?
Will her smile fade in a flood of tears Or can I keep the fears at bay?
Echoing, distant voices wither into silence.
But there is one thing that will never ever age...
My love for you is timeless
Pain that won't heal
Sadness you feel
Smiles with hearts' bitterness replaced
"I'll never smile again"
"I'll never let love in"
Don't ever say such things to me
A future we cannot see
All happenings Find meaning in the story
In time the clouds will clear away, so just stay, please stay with me...
Whoa!
Who are we to pass through you?
Whoa!
That answer will find you someday
Such a narrow sky.
What is that?
The sky is glowing.
It crashed!
It ran into the Soul Shield Membrane and stopped!
To crash there and not be destroyed...
Could it be a body of spiritual power of such great concentration...?
If we are separated, we will be blown apart by the shock!
Wha!
Grab onto whoever is nearest to you!
Don't let go, no matter what!
Damn it!
What do you mean by that?
!
Let me sit on your shoulder.
Yoruichi!
Ishida...!
Chad...?
!
Chad...?
!
Chad!
Chad!
C-Chad!
Damn it...!
Ichigo!
Inoue!
Damn...!
They split up into four!
The strongest one...
Which one is it?
!
Hold on to me, Ishida!
Hinagiku!
Baigon!
Lily!
Santen Kesshun! "I reject!"
What's your problem?
!
Shut up!
Stay back!
Turn to sand!
Seppa!
Thanks to your weird skill, we are saved...
How'd the sand get in there?
Your skill did this!
Quit coughing!
Hey...!
You got a lot of nerve, punching the guy who saved your life!
Who said that?
!
I only said we were saved!
Yahoo!
What luck!
We skipped out on the tiresome guard duty, but you fall right into our hands!
Lucky, I'm lucky!
Today, I'm lucky!
You, on the other hand, are not.
Huh?
This hole's huge.
How is this possible...?
!
N-No body.
That means he's still alive!
Find him!
Right!
Now...
What do I do?
It's coming!
Get ready!
Wha?
It disappeared...
Damn.
Find them!
So now I'm all alone...
But it might be better this way.
Uh uh.
No good Ichigo...
No...
Not Poo-san, it's Pee-tan...!
They sound alike, but they're different...
Ms. Inoue...?
- No, Ichigo!
- Ms. Inoue!
Oh Ichigo!
- Ouch.
- Ow!
Oh?
Ishida...
Are you all right, Ms. Inoue...?
Oh...
That's right...
It appears we were able to land, luckily, in an unpopulated area.
Oh!
Careful!
You were injured in the fall.
I administered first aid with the bandages I had, but I didn't have any painkillers...
S-So you did.
Thank you...
You keep bandages on hand...?
Uh...oh, I'm fine!
I'm sorry.
You were shielding me...
If it weren't for me, you would never have gotten hurt.
You think so?
I'm such a klutz, I would've gotten hurt, anyway.
And if you weren't there with the first aid kit,
I would've bled, become anemic...
And wouldn't be able to move.
Does that sound weird?
No...
Let's just get going.
That was a pretty loud landing.
A crowd will be gathering soon.
Right...
Luck, luck, luck, luck, luck, luck...
Lucky!
Luck, luck, luck...
Lucky!
Luck, luck, luck, luck...
Lucky-y!
What're you doing, fools?
!
I was doing my "Lucky Dance" for you while waiting for you to come crawling out!
What're you gaping like idiots at?
!
- Don't you understand human kindness?
!
- What's with him?
-Hey!
-Huh?
What is it?
- I'm gonna run first chance I get.
- Courtesy is the basis...
- You're gonna run?
What're you thinking?
!
- Of the Samurai Code!
Fool!
Can't you see?
!
They have way greater spiritual powers...
- Than ordinary Soul Reapers!
- What's this arguing about?
!
Hmph... maybe they're scared out of their wits to fight us.
Well, let them take their time and argue.
But if they take too long, other guys will come and steal our glory.
Yeah, that's true.
Fine!
I'll set a time limit!
So kind!
- I'll do another dance...
- Anyhow, I'm gonna run!
- So you two can do what you want.
- If you wanna fight, be my guest!
Huh?
A disagreement?
Something like that.
Crap.
Don't give us trouble.
Yumichika!
Right!
As I expected, one of them is after me!
Damn!
Yo!
Huh?
Tell me...
Why didn't you run?
The other guy ran because he saw that our strength was greater than his, right?
I think he made the right decision.
If your strength is greater than mine, it's useless to run.
You'd catch me for sure.
But... if my strength is greater...
I'll just defeat you and be on my way.
That's all.
I see...
I guess you're not stupid, after all.
He dodged it!
Moves well!
With the sheath?
!
At least... tell me your name.
Ichigo Kurosaki.
Ichigo...?
That's a good name.
Think so?
No one ever praised it before.
Yeah.
Guys with "ichi" in their names are full of talent and good looks.
I'm 3rd Seat Assistant Adjutant, Squad 11.
Ikkaku Madarame!
My fellow "ichi," let's be friends!
No way!
Dammit!
He's persistent!
Won't he ever stop?
!
Humph...
What ugly running.
Up ahead.
Turn into sand!
Seppa!
Hmm!
What an unusual skill!
That's how you made that earlier crater?
But if you're not careful...
Seppa!
Up ahead, there's...
W-What's this?
!
This is dangerous!
This is the old execution ground.
We brought captive Hollows and threw them down here to fight criminals.
We would watch from up there.
Soul Reapers do crude things, don't they...?
Not as crude as your face.
Pity you.
"Pretty"?
Even you recognize my dazzling handsomeness, don't you?
Not "pretty"!
I said, "Pity"!
I know that!
I made a witty, humorous joke!
Besides, that "crude" practice no longer exists.
Only, those who fall in can never get out.
That should be enough chasing around and prattle for now.
It's time.
I'll let you choose.
Will you die... by my sword?
Or will you fall in that hole... and die?
Which will you choose?
Oops...
If you're angry, turn and let me see your face.
No matter how it looks...
I love that look of agony when one must choose how to die.
You're a crude bastard, after all, aren't you...?
I don't get it.
Hm?
Sure, we got a distance between us, but only a greenhorn would let one hand leave his sword during a match!
S-Shut up!
I can't see with the blood in my eyes!
I only wiped it!
On the forehead, even a shallow wound bleeds profusely...
Unless you stop the bleeding, it's useless to wipe it.
Hey!
That's dirty!
You have a styptic to stop the bleeding!
It's not dirty!
It's brains!
Brains!
You should admire me for being experienced!
Yeah?
Hah!
You sure are a strange guy...
You behave like a greenhorn.
And you don't look much like a fighter.
But...
You have excellent reflexes!
And fierce attack!
You could even say your movements are coming close to mine!
Don't look so angry.
I'm praising you.
You're too good to be dismissed as a mere greenhorn with natural abilities...
Who was your teacher, Ichigo?
It was only for ten days, so I don't know if I can call him "Teacher,"
but there is a man who taught me how to fight.
Who?
Kisuke...
Urahara.
I see...
He was your teacher...
In that case, it would be rude to kill you without giving my all.
Lengthen!
Hozuki-maru!
A spear?
!
No time to look surprised, Ichigo!
I'm coming at ya!
Don't misread this!
Not me!
Heh!
A spear's reach is long.
I know that much!
I won't misread it!
Wrong!
An opening!
Split apart!
Hozuki maru!
Now...
look this way.
Show me your expression in your last moment of life.
Each time I see such things, my beauty grows even keener.
Get beautiful without my help!
You wretch!
Turn into sand!
Seppa!
What are you doing?
!
To beautiful me...!
Oh, no!
I'm falling, falling!
Falling!
Disgraceful.
Talk about digging your own grave.
I guess some actually do it.
How trifling.
Huh?
!
Gotcha.
A strange trick...!
What is that orb?
!
Heh...
Good thing I brought a spare...
This is a Cannonball developed by Shiba Kukaku,
The best sis in the world.
Not even a Zanpaku to can easily shatter it.
Oh, my.
How he underestimates me...
I am 5th Seat of Squad 11, the strongest Squad.
Don't think I'm any ordinary Soul Reaper...!
Bloom!
Fuji Kujaku!
I'll break that spiritual partition with a single blow!
Oh yeah...
I forgot to tell you, this bomb of my Sis's...
Once its concentration of spiritual power is broken, it quickly...
You sneaky...!
Clever strategy, wasn't it...?
Still...
You are a tough bastard!
Don't tell me you thought that was enough to kill me off.
Now I'm really mad!
You'll pay...!
Can't hear you.
Seppa!
Running again?
!
Kiss my butt.
Ugly...
Too ugly...!
I warned you not to misread it.
Hozuki maru isn't a spear.
It's a "sansetsukon."
Does it hurt?
That hand probably can't hold a sword anymore.
I'm a kind hearted guy.
Ordinarilly, I would've taken you in alive.
Sorry, though.
I get no recognition unless I kill you.
Fine!
What're you doing?
Let's go!
Don't talk as if it's over.
I still haven't shown you my skill.
It starts now, lkkaku.
Fine words.
Greenhorn!
I looked up into the night sky and saw a comet
I want to see you right now, but I can't fly
If I could become a comet
I would fly across the sky...
I'm sure
I would circle the skies and shine over you
With this instantaneous light that will definitely reach you
If I could become a comet
I'm sure I'll alway stay close to you
Now and forever
You're pretty good, Ichigo.
But the real battle starts now.
It's too late to come crying with apologies!
That's my line!
Fight!
Hit it, Cover it, Rock Scissors Paper!
Not that kind of battle!
Gotcha!
Too shallow.
His face just now it was Inoue's brother!
But why would Inoue's brother be after me?
I don't know.
judging from the Hollow who attacked you last time another powerful Hollow hidden from us means to devour your spirit energy.
several other Hollows are being manipulated by that one.
the actions of Inoue's brother would make sense.
That isn't funny!
What am I supposed to do?
I can't kill Inoue's brother!
Don't lose your head!
he will wander around forever.
he will most definitely return and attack you again.
Wait!
We may not have time to worry about that.
What do you mean?
That girl is in danger.
That was delicious.
Yeah it was.
Want to eat some dessert now?
I have green onions and sweet bean jelly.
It's really delicious to eat with a friend.
But that sounds gross...
What was that?
Enraku...
This is horrible.
How'd you get torn like this?
What's that?
!
Hollows attack their own family?
It happens once in a while.
What the hell for?
Hollows are fallen souls.
Souls that weren't led to Soul Society by Soul Reapers souls that were not protected from other Hollows those souls lose their hearts and become Hollows themselves.
he will try to fill the emptiness inside by seeking out the soul of the person he loved most in life.
Do you remember the large bruise on Inoue's leg this afternoon?
That was the mark of a Hollow's touch.
Then that accident was Inoue's brother's fault?
Possibly.
What is this?
Orihime!
What's this!
?
Why am I bleeding?
!
What on Earth...?
What is this...?
What's happening?
What is that monster?
That's me?
Why?
What is this chain?
It really hurts.
Tatsuki-chan!
I can't be zoning like this...
Tatsuki-chan!
Tatsuki-chan.
Keep away!
what's wrong?
Tatsuki-chan!
Orihime.
she can't even see us.
Tatsuki-chan!
How do you know my name?
Orihime.
Have you forgotten my voice?
It's me.
Can't you tell?
stay away!
I'm saddened!
I'm saddened!
I'm saddened!
I thought you were... after me!
Tatsuki got in the crossfire...
Kurosaki-kun?
It really is you.
But how?
Inoue?
What about you... how can you see me?
How come?
Soul Reapers are spirits.
Only other spiritual entities can see you.
There's no way normal people can see you.
Spirit entity?
That's right.
that's her soul.
Orihime is dead!
Damn it!
Don't move!
Ichigo!
Ichigo!
Ichigo!
Ichigo!
Ichigo!
Kurosaki-kun!
Let go!
Let me go!
Kurosaki-kun...
Let go!
Orihime...
Have you really forgotten me?
Onii...chan?
Ichigo!
Ichigo!
Stop yelling...
That's all you have to say?
Where are you injured?
No where.
I'm fine.
I see.
Okay then.
But don't forget... he's a monster now.
He has no human feeling left in him.
Do not hesitate to kill him.
Onii-chan?
Yes...
Orihime.
It can't be.
My brother would never do something like this.
I was lonely.
I kept fading little by little from your heart... you prayed for me everyday.
I've always watched over you.
My suffering was eased just by your prayers.
But after about a year you became friends with that girl.
After that you prayed for me less often.
Then... you stopped praying altogether.
That's why... so very lonely... that's not it--
Orihime!
don't betray me anymore!
You should do as I say.
Don't worry... it won't be much longer now.
I'll devour that Soul Reaper and put an end to this!
Wait!
Kurosaki-kun has nothing to do with this.
Onii-chan...
Don't hurt him anymore!
Be silent!
Who's fault do you think this whole thing is?
!
It's your fault!
just listen to what I say!
I'll kill you first!
Stop!
you...
Do you know why big brothers are born first?
It's to protect the little sisters and brothers that come after them.
Ichigo!
I'll kill you.
even if you are dead!
Shut up...
Orihime belongs to me!
I raised her in place of the parents who abandoned us!
Since Orihime was three...
I've always protected her!
Orihime!
come to me.
If you listen to me I won't hurt the others.
it's a trap!
He no longer has the heart of your brother.
But...
Onii-chan!
Onii-chan!
What's happening?
!
Orihime BELONGS TO ME!
You wish!
Inoue is Inoue!
She doesn't belong to anyone!
Why are you hesitating?
!
Kill him!
Inoue...
Orihime...
Onii-chan.
It's my fault.
Don't leave me alone" that day...
Onii-chan!
don't die!
Don't leave me alone!
That's why... you couldn't go... to heaven.
Orihime...
I knew that you were always nearby.
when I was about to get hit by that car you protected me.
Look out!" and pulled my leg.
So that's it.
you couldn't rest peacefully.
That's why I wanted to show you...
That I was happy... that you didn't need to worry.
But that... made you...
lonely.
it--
It-It's not your...
What the...
What's going on?
he's struggling against the Hollow within him.
He did not become a Hollow of his own will.
He was most likely consumed by other Hollows against his will.
Why?
!
You don't know?
Their aim must have been you.
Souls consumed by powerful Hollows end up being manipulated by those Hollows.
the Hollow who's after you consumed a soul you'd find hard to fight and then sent it to attack you.
he's desperately fighting that Hollow...
For his sister's sake.
Orihime!
Orihi--
Inoue!
Stay calm!
The chain of fate on her chest isn't broken yet.
she won't die.
I will heal her.
Step back.
I can still save her with my Kidoh.
right?
Inoue told me.
That's why she wears them everyday.
Hey.
If I stay as I am I'll eventually become a monster again.
while my mind is still clear...
I want to pass on.
that's-
Ichigo!
His decision is right.
you can never return to normal.
Let him pass on as he wishes.
Rukia!
Do not worry.
To reap a Hollow does not mean you're killing it.
It means you're cleansing its sin... the Soul Society.
And that is why we Soul Reapers exist.
Onii-chan!
On the day you bought these hairpins I complained to you because I thought they were too childish.
I let you go to work without saying a word...
And that was our goodbye.
So... now let me say it properly.
see you later.
see you later.
I'm telling you!
A sumo champion really came to my room and blew a hole in the wall with a gun.
You and that story again.
Make it sound more realistic next time.
Like a pro-wrestler came and had a fight outside the ring or something.
'Hime.
It's really true!
Tatsuki-chan?
Yeah...
Wow!
Tatsuki?
!
This is what you did last night?
it's like...
Yup.
what just-
Inoue!
What's that?
!
A memory modifier.
I erased her memory of tonight and put in a substitute.
Memory modifier?
!
they're random.
you'll see what I mean tomorrow.
huh?
I did.
What's wrong?
I still can't say I'm committed.
I'm not such a saint that I can promise to risk my life for strangers.
But...
Neither am I a scumbag who can sit quietly while people are hurt before my eyes.
I'd like to help you out.
With the Soul Reaper work.
Sure.
I'm looking forward to it.
thank you for always protecting me up until now.
I'll do my best to be happy...
Onii-chan.
Inoue... this is an episode preview.
We're out of time again!

Did Urahara-san mess up his calculations?
I extended you an invitation.
Kagerouza!
I made some subtle adjustments to the Severed World in the process.
What for?
Why are you after Nozomi?
!
What's Nozomi's... body hiding?
!
you are full of so many questions.
I shall be so kind as to answer the first of them.
Why did I summon you here?
It is quite simple.
To erase your existence!
Erase me?
Why me?
Tell me!
You should not exist.
You are not human.
Nor are you pure Shinigami or pure Hollow.
something with spirit particles that cannot be used for a reigai.
An uncertain factor.
you are a hindrance to my plans.
Kurosaki Ichigo-san.
What's wrong?
!
Kurosaki-san's reiatsu... has completely vanished.
Urahara-san?
Exactly what I said.
His reiatsu just disappeared all of a sudden.
You don't mean...

You have no time to worry about him!
Old Man Yama.
You haven't spent all these years serving as General just 'cause you make a good figurehead.
and you still won't go down.
And yet your reiatsu is steadily weakening.
The wounds from your earlier attacks could not have been healed as easily as these.
You've got that right. the battle will eventually be over.
Is that all you have to say?
well...
looks like he's not giving up without a fight after all.
That's just how it is.
This is very bad.
The captains who went in first only made it out by the skin of their teeth too.
Can you get any response from Ichigo?
none at all.
So you're saying Kurosaki-kun is...
The last signal from him came with the Capturing Ram approaching.
We are forced to assume that it engulfed him.
Engulfed him?
!
It can't be...
No...
After all he's done...
Nozomi?
You look down.
I'm not.
Don't worry.
They're all going to protect you.
I'm off.
It's my... fault...
Nozomi-chan...
Don't!
Ichigo...
It seems...
You can still move? then I will just have to beat the strength to dodge out of you.
It's fine!
Ichigo's not gonna kick the bucket from a little thing like that.
What?
!
You saying you don't trust my awesome insight?
!
You're completely right.
Kurosaki's not the type to die that easily.
Yeah.
Ichigo is doing this of his own free will.
You're not responsible for him.
it's all true.
So don't blame yourself.
but he always keeps his promises.
and just wait.
What?
!
You're staring at me.
How can all of you have so much faith in him?
You're always like this.
I-It's not like we believe in him or anything.
Yes.
just an ordinary master and-
though.
We should head to Soul Society as well.
Now that really is worrying too much.
Yeah.
Don't take our captains lightly.
Looks like you're done.
\alphaHFF)}
\alphaHFF)}Tenken!
What?
!
So I was careless.
I never thought you still had that much strength left.
I will defeat you Genryuusai-dono!
That's a lost cause.
What?
The General's fate has already been sealed.
Genryuusai-sensei.
Old Man Yama...
You must sense it too.
the General's reiatsu has been weakening.
And it's not the only one.
Kuchiki Byakuya.
none will ever reach Kagerouza.
You are gravely underestimating that great man.
What are you saying?
!
Genryuusai-dono is the strongest Shinigami of the last millennium.
crap.
Savour the full taste of Ennetsu Jigoku.
It seems you can no longer move with your lightning speed.
You are doing no better.
It's true...
I have little spiritual power left.
what are you fighting for?
Hmph.
I am carrying out my duty.
I see.
Just the kind of clear answer I'd expect from you.
But that is not all there is.
What?
!
Those who become captains do not grow in power unless they bear some kind of burden.
a real reason for fighting!
It would seem that you have thought of one.
All of us here fight for the sake of that one thing we cannot surrender.
Let us finish this!

Another sizeable reiatsu has vanished.
Captains Zaraki and Komamura.
And General Yamamoto.
It seems that not one of them has made it this far.
The remaining reiatsu will vanish soon enough.
You cannot continue to fight with those injuries.
Yet you still struggle?

It does not need two.

Pain that won't heal
Sadness you feel
Scars that just refuse to fade from memory
Sometimes the burden's too much for one to bear
Don't give up on me, please don't turn me away
Whoa!
I'll hold your hand in mine
Will I lose my hold on her someday?
Will her smile fade in a flood of tears Or can I keep the fears at bay?
Echoing, distant voices wither into silence.
But there is one thing that will never ever age...
My love for you is timeless
Pain that won't heal
Sadness you feel
Smiles with hearts' bitterness replaced
"I'll never smile again"
"I'll never let love in"
Don't ever say such things to me
A future we cannot see
All happenings Find meaning in the story
In time the clouds will clear away, so just stay, please stay with me...
Whoa!
Who are we to pass through you?
Whoa!
That answer will find you someday
Tsubaki!
Koten Zanshun!
"I reject!"
Tsubaki!
Fool...
Faltering like that...!
That was the first time I saw such a technique.
There's no intent to kill in your attack.
Though you might kill Hollows with that move, it will have no effect on Soul Reapers.
Have you mistaken this place for a playground?
This is a battlefield!
Without the intent to kill...
You'll never stop anyone!
Wha?
!
So you want an attack with intent to kill?
Then fight me.
It's here in my bow...
The intent to kill you love so much.
Huh...
Very interesting.
Would you be a Quincy?
That's right.
Ishida's bow...
It's totally different from the one I saw!
In its appearance and even in its Spiritual Pressure...!
That glove...
He must have been practicing in order to use it properly.
This is interesting.
One uses an unfamiliar skill;
the other is a Quincy.
And both employ projectile weapons.
And you've both come to fight me.
What coincidence!
What a twist of fate.
Now I must show you.
The true form of my Zanpaku-to.
Spread your wings, Tsunzaki Garasu!
Huh!
What do you think?
Now, lament.
I am 4th Seat of Squad 7!
Jirobo lkkanzaka!
Also known as Jirobo Wind Scythe!
The nickname, Wind Scythe, proves that
I am the most skilled in projectile weapons.
My countless blades dance through space.
No one has seen my Tsunzaki Garasu and lived!
Here, here.
How do you like it?
You can't even follow them with your eyes, can you?
As a fellow master of flying weapons, you'll fully regret having met me...
Huh?
How interesting.
Unlike the human world...
Here, the so called strongest fighter seems to be the most long winded whiner.
R-Ridiculous!
That was a fluke!
Don't be so cocky.
You still don't understand?
Sorry, but if you're supposed to be the strongest,
I take back your nickname as of today.
Where flying weapons are concerned, I seem to be the better man.
The name, "Uryu Weasel with Scythe," though, doesn't sound all too cool.
M-My hand...
My hand...
My left hand...!
Amazing...
Uryu...
Compared to that time he was battling the Hollows alongside Ichigo...
He's become a completely different person!
Do you lament it even a little?
As a fellow practitioner of projectile weaponry...
Your misfortune of meeting me...
Me...
Lament?
!
Damn you brat!
You do realize that I missed on purpose.
And next time, I won't miss.
Amazing!
That was amazing!
The speed, power and accuracy of your technique...
All of which surpass mine.
To think that I should meet such a skillful practitioner...
I am utterly defeated.
Please, boil me, bake me, do whatever you want to me.
Why won't you shoot me?
Could it be that you are letting me go?
I'm a Quincy.
I have no mercy for a Soul Reaper.
It's just that I don't like bullying the weak.
Hurry up and get lost...
Before I change my mind.
It seems you are a kind hearted person.
However... that will be... your... undoing!
Since you couldn't beat me, you thought you could at least get Orihime?
Or were you planning to take her hostage?
H-How did you know?
I don't like bullying the weak...
But I don't mind exposing cowards.
From the moment you showed up, you were targeting her, not me.
Most would find it beneath themselves to attack a lady when she's not looking.
An honorable person with any decent pride wouldn't do such a thing;
that's a coward's way of fighting.
Amazing.
And good bye.
You don't even deserve the time to lament.
Thank you, Uryu.
I-It's okay, you don't need to thank me.
I...
"Didn't really do much?"
Did he die?
No...
I shot out the Soul Chain and Hakusui Soul Sleep, vital spots that control the generation of the spiritual energy.
He's not dead.
However, he'll lose his spirit powers.
And once he awakes, he'll no longer return to being a Soul Reaper.
As a result of this battle...
that's sufficient.
Shall we go?
Uh huh.
I've heard from Yoruichi,
"A Quincy gathers the spiritual particles around them to fight. "
I'm sure he uses that glove to increase his ability to gather spiritual particles.
Because of its overwhelming power, in order to avoid harming us,
Uryu was training by himself.
And he was able to master it to that degree...
In just ten days, all by himself.
You're incredible, Uryu.
What have I done in those ten days?
Oops!
T-Thank you.
Yeah.
This isn't...
Orihime!
Hang in there, Orihime!
That's right
- I promised!
Orihime!
Huh?
A Are you all right?
Did you get hurt earlier?
Ah, oh no!
I'm sorry, it's nothing!
I just got teary eyed looking at the sun.
Don't you get that sometimes?
You know, like sneezing.
Or wanting to go to the restroom when you're at the bookstore, or your gums bleeding when you bite into an apple.
Well, let's go, Uryu!
I'm going to do my best too!
Orihime...
What?
Are you sure you're all right?
Huh?
How come?
Well...
Why am I the only one getting chased around over and over?
!
Hey stop, you side burned monkey!
Stop squirming, you lower eyelash!
You with that ugly face!
W-What did you say?
!
That other guy was kind of good looking, but no matter how I look at it, you have no place to comment on my looks!
What did you say?
!
We're going to eat you, Ugly!
With this many on my tail, I can't even win an argument!
Oh?
!
Ichigo!
Reinforcements!
Just in time...
Or not!
He--y, Ganju--!
W-Wait minute!
Why are you getting chased around too?
It makes no sense to get together!
Idiot!
Stop waving at me!
You're riling up the guys running behind you!
I said don't come this way...
Let's go, Ganju!
Duck!
This is lemura.
Squad 4, Unohana Relief Crew,
Groups 1, 6 and 14 are approaching enemy position.
Let's hustle!
This is not a drill!
Yes, sir!
That was dangerous, you fool!
Why'd you swing that blade out of the blue like that?
!
Are you crazy?
!
What?
I told you to duck, didn't I?
!
The problem is that the time between warning me and doing it was too short, too fast!
Well, you should have reacted right away!
Like I could have, you moron!
Let's see...
So, now what?
We got away with a surprise attack just now, but just 'cause we showed them some muscle...
These guys don't look like the type to back off.
Damn.
I'm totally late.
What should I do...?
Should I go back?
But if Mr. Lemura asks, "Where'd you go?"
It'll be hard to answer.
Oh, but if I don't go, he'll get even angrier...
Anyway, where did everyone go?
I wonder...
Oh yeah!
I'll ask those people up ahead!
Ah, umm...
Excuse me, I'm from the Squad...4...
-W-What are you doing, twerp!
-Excuse me!
Damn it, stay away!
-Who the heck are you?
-E-Excuse me!
What's the commotion?
Hmm?
Huh?
O-Ouch...
That was terrible...
Ichigo...
I've got an easy plan to get us out of here.
What a coincidence.
Me too.
A-Ah...
A plan to get out of here?
Ah, umm...c-could it be...
that you two are the...alleged...
Ryoka?
!
Hey!
Open up a path, you punks!
If you punks value your friend's life!
No way!
It's them!
Aren't we there yet, Yachiru?
!
Is it really this way?
I'm sure, I'm sure.
I'm positive it's this way...
I think.
"I think"?
Did you just say "I think"?
Oh, be quiet.
Then, this way!
"Then"?
Did you just say "then"?
Why are you always complaining?
You decide then!
I don't care anymore!
Ugh...
This way, right?
Yup, yup, this way, this way!
You're positive?
You're absolutely positive, right?
Hey!
Open up a path, you punks!
If you punks value your friend's life!
No, let me go!
Let me...
W-What's with this vibe?
Maybe they didn't hear us...
Wanna try again?
O-Okay.
Hey.
Open up a path, you punks!
If you punks value your friend's life!
Hey!
Uh, y-yes...
- What...
- Are you jerks doing?
Huh?
Well, umm, taking a hostage?
And he looks like our friend?
You're not?
I-I'm from the Squad 4.
These guys are from Squad 11.
So, what's the difference?
Heh, I guess it's true these Ryoka are outsiders.
I don't want you to lump us together, so I'll tell you.
Clean out your ear holes and listen carefully!
There are a total of 13 Guard Squads that protect the Seireitei.
We, the Squad 11, are lead by the strongest of the 13 captains.
As such, we are the strongest in battle of the 13!
Oh!
Now that you mention it, these guys all have weird hairstyles, but yours is normal.
T-Thanks.
So, you're from where?
I-I'm from the Squad 4.
The Squad 4 is the rear echelon
- that specializes in relief and aid.
- Ouwie, ouwie, go away!
A bunch of wimps that can't
- even wield a sword properly.
- Yay, he's all better!
They're the weakling pansies of the 13 squads.
Oh boy, it's heavy...
To be honest, I don't know why they even exist.
Hip, hip, hooray!
We can't stand them!
They annoy us!
Therefore, we, the Squad 11 ...
Hate the Squad 4!
So if you want to kill him, go ahead!
You'll be doing us a favor!
Nooo-!
W-W-Wait a minute!
Isn't it too cruel to say you don't care what happens to him just because you don't like him?
Huh, you guys?
!
Wow, that's a rational argument.
Let's go!
Go get them!
Damn, I guess we're going to have to muscle our way out of here.
Huh!
W-What was that?
I-I don't know...
Anyway!
I'm certain that it halved our enemy, so this is our chance now!
Oryah!
Move it, move it!
I thought I sensed Ichigo's Spiritual Pressure...
I must have missed him.
Hey, you there!
Did you just do that, you jerk?
!
What's with the weird get up?
Are you a friend of those guys from earlier?
Guys?
Earlier?
Probably, yeah.
Great!
You think you can mock the Squad 11 and get out of here alive?
We'll crush you in five minutes!
Sorry, but I can't accommodate your wishes...
Huh?
What did you say?
It won't take five minutes.
I'll be done in two minutes.
Fourth Squad
- General Relief Station
So, you're not going to say anything no matter what?
Ikkaku Madarame...
Why don't you say something?
Please sir!
Mr. Captain of Squad 12!
Such interrogation is prohibited on these premises.
Shut up!
Sir Mayuri...
You be quiet too, Nemu!
Just shut up, okay?
Do you want to be pulled to pieces again?
No, sir.
Forgive me.
It's not that I don't want to say...
I really don't know.
I don't know the Ryoka's objective, destination or anything, for that matter.
Then, what?
So you're saying that although you've met and fought these Ryoka, you were just defeated in battle and retreated like a dog without gaining any information?
Is that it?
Exactly.
Furthermore...
I have not seen the enemy's face, nor heard his voice.
So, I have not a shred of information to give you.
Fine...
Then you shall receive a punishment...
Befitting your failure.
Right?
!
I'm surprised.
Since when did you get so powerful that you can punish those of other squads...
Kurotsuchi?
Zaraki...!
Humph, well, if his captain is here, then there's no need for me to interrogate him.
I'll withdraw for now.
Let's go, Nemu!
Stop stalling, you dullard.
Yes, sir.
Captain...
You got yourself pretty beat up there, huh?
Are you here just to visit me?
Nope, we got lost on our way!
Oh, the Lieutenant is here too?
It's by coincidence that we wound up here, but we were worried about you.
Are you okay, Baldy?
I told you not to call me that, you brat!
Then, Shiny Baldy?
You heard me, didn't you?
Shiny, Shiny Baldy!
I heard...that you lost.
My deepest apologies.
I've come back despite the shame of my defeat.
Is he strong?
Yes, indeed.
He appears to be a Soul Reaper.
He wears a Shihakusho, short orange hair, with a body length sword without a guard or grip.
He is headed towards Senzaikyu Shishinro.
That maximum security prison.
I gave him your description, and told him to be on the lookout for you.
If he heeded my words...
You will surely enjoy an excellent battle, regardless of where you meet him.
He's strong, and I fear that strength is still growing.
By the time he meets up with you, he will probably be stronger still.
I see...
And his name is...?
I'm Hanataro Yamada.
It's hard to remember!
Really?
Everyone tells me it's an easy name to remember!
Oh, yeah?
I get "Taro Yamada" or "Hanako Yamada,"
but "Hanataro" is so hard to remember, hard.
Gosh...
Besides, aren't you our enemy?
Huh?
Why are you so laid back and introducing yourself?
Ah, I guess so.
Now that you've mentioned it...
Why did we bring this guy with us?
Couldn't help it.
He was nearby, so I accidentally carried him with us!
Accidentally?
!
What do you mean, accidentally?
Do you pick up whatever is lying on the ground?
Shut up!
You didn't notice him yourself until just now!
P Please, you two.
Stop fighting over me!
Who's fighting over you?
!
But, if you raise your voices, someone might find us!
Are we all right?
It seems so.
But still, if it's true what that bald guy said, and even if Rukia
- is in that white tower,
- Oh!
The problem is which road to take to get there.
Oh, that's right.
I have a map.
We wouldn't want to run into any Captains along the way, huh?
If we only knew the enemy's positions...
By the way...
There are no roads on this map...
What?
Huh?
What's this?
Peace!
Did you draw this yourself?
What?
It's better than having nothing.
Umm ...
Shut up, we're in the middle of strategizing.
Don't butt in.
Actually, you can go home already.
You're not going to be of much use anyway.
I swear...
Rukia...
Are you talking about Rukia Kuchiki?
Just as I thought...
It's her, isn't it?
The younger sister of the Captain of Squad 6, currently held in maximum security...
Then that "white tower" you referred to is the Senzaikyu.
I...
I know the hidden way into that tower.
Kenny, you seem pretty happy.
Huh?
Are you talking about me?
Yup!
I haven't seen you this happy in a while.
Is that so?
You might be right...
He survived against Ichimaru.
He defeated Ikkaku.
And, lkkaku said he was strong.
Ikkaku said he would become stronger still!
Where?
Where are you?
I, Kenpachi Zaraki, am waiting for you!
Come out!
Ichigo Kurosaki!
I looked up into the night sky and saw a comet
I want to see you right now, but I can't fly
If I could become a comet
I would fly across the sky...
I'm sure
I would circle the skies and shine over you
With this instantaneous light that will definitely reach you
If I could become a comet
I'm sure I'll always stay close to you
Now and forever
Yo, how's everyone doing?
This is everyone's idol, Kon!
Why isn't it my turn yet?
I've been ready and waiting over here!
Hey, are you listening to me?
If you make too much of a fuss, you may never get your turn.
Oh, yes.
I will always be waiting, so please be nice to this stuffed doll.
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently...
until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate, life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
I knew it!
You don't even know your Zanpaku-to's name.
And you think you can fight me as an equal?
Well, it's 2000 years too soon!
Roar!
Zabimaru!
Look in front of you!
What stands before you is... your prey!
It's all over, punk!
You will lose to Renji Abarai, and die on this spot!
BLEACH 17
Sorry, kid.
But that's what's known as a difference in strength.
The Zanpaku-to changes in size and shape depending on its wielder's spiritual energy.
And this is the manifestation of my spiritual energy!
Well kid, I think it's about time I got going.
I don't like the air here.
One attack will show him the difference in strength, make him realize that he has no chance, and back down while his wound is not serious.
That was my hope.
But Ichigo would never give up because of such a reason.
I knew that.
Are you ready?
Can you still move, Ichigo?
Then run!
Please, hurry!
No answer?
Run!
What are you doing, Rukia?
!
Hey!
Let go!
Are you trying to deepen your guilt?
!
Let go, you fool!
Run, Ichigo!
Stand!
Stand and run!
Ichigo!
What?
You still have the strength to move?
Fine.
I was just thinking that it's no fun to finish off someone who can't move anymore.
Well then, fight hard and die!
Ichigo, if you can stand, get away!
Run, Ichigo!
Ichi...?
!
What's the matter?
If you won't attack, I will!
What is this sudden increase in his Spiritual Pressure!
What the hell?
!
What's with this kid?
!
He was about to die earlier!
Where'd he get all this power?
What's wrong?
Your moves have slowed down considerably.
Idiot!
You just got faster!
I don't understand this, but it feels good.
I don't even feel the pain from the wound!
And I don't feel like I can lose!
Why you...!
Roar, Zabimaru!
Renji is being pressured!
Ichigo?
You're good at dodging around!
What's happening?
!
How much higher can his spiritual energy go?
!
But that's about to end.
Heavy...
I won't make it in time...
W-What the?
!
My Zanpaku-to...
No... he didn't do anything.
Was it him?
Impossible...
He can't do a thing from that distance.
Huh?
!
Is he coming?
What happened just now?
Did he get me?
I can't even tell if I was hit from the back... or the front.
It hurts...
You're slow.
Even when you fall.
Brother Byakuya!
It's been awhile since I saw it, but he's awesome, after all.
I had to strain to follow his second attack.
But his first one...
I couldn't even tell when he drew his sword, or put it back.
If I couldn't see it coming...
He probably doesn't even know what happened to him.
Still...
What was that extraordinary Spiritual Pressure he demonstrated earlier?
What's the matter, Renji?
No...
You didn't need to help me with a kid of this level, Captain.
Don't say that.
If all I did was watch each time...
I'd get rusty.
No, this man is...
And I am...
Ichigo!
Ichigo!
Stop!
Let go, Renji!
Ichigo is...
What are you saying, fool?
!
Look hard!
The kid is dead!
Don't you understand?
!
By just touching him, your sentence will increase by 20 years!
Why would you multiply your crimes for a dead person?
!
I'm the one who got Ichigo involved in this.
It's my fault he's dead!
So what's wrong with my coming to him?
!
So even if it would make your sentence harsher, you can't stay away...
from this kid?
Brother...
I understand, Rukia.
This kid...
looks a lot...
like him.
I understand, Rukia.
This kid...
looks a lot like him.
"He's dead," you say?
"Looks a lot like him"?
Quit talking about me like I'm not here!
Ichi...!
Let go.
I can't hear you.
Look at me when you speak!
This kid can still move?
!
No way!
I see...
You don't need that arm, huh?
Huh?
!
W-What're you doing, Rukia?
!
You're just a human...
You're just a human!
How dare you grab my brother like that?
!
Know your place, kid!
Let us go, Brother!
Through his actions just now...
I, Rukia Kuchiki, have opened my eyes.
Please take me back to the Soul Society.
I will atone for my sins.
Wait you!
What're you saying?
!
Rukia, you!
You don't know when to give up, do you?
Quit squirming about and die!
There is no need to inflict the final blow upon him.
Leave him and he will eventually die on his own.
Let us go, Brother.
Wait, Rukia!
What kind of joke is this?
!
Look at me, hey!
Hey!
Do not move!
Take even one step from there...
Try to come after me...
And I'll...
I'll...
I will never forgive you!
You will die anyway... so stay there and live, even if just one second longer.
Fine.
I will not inflict the finishing blow.
With the two attacks jus now, I've shattered his Soul Chain and Hakusui
- Soul Sleep, the vital spots of the soul.
He should die in less than an hour.
And even if he does survive, his powers will be lost,
Soul Reaper power, as well as his spiritual energy.
Renji...
Yes.
Open!
I can't speak...
I can't move...
I was protected... again...
Rukia!
It hurts.
My body feels heavy.
It's cold.
It doesn't hurt.
Oh no, am I about to die?
I probably don't feel pain because I'm on the verge of death.
That's right... my body was so cold earlier, but I'm feeling warmth now.
It's warm.
Oh, good reaction!
That's good.
Y-You're too close!
Boss!
Kurosaki is awake!
Boss!
I've seen you before!
You're Sandal-Hat's friend!
Why are you under the covers with me?
!
Get off!
Huh?
!
Huh?
I'm not dead?
!
Why?
And this isn't my house.
Where am I?
Now, now.
You mustn't be up, Kurosaki.
Your wounds haven't closed yet.
You'll die if you move around too much.
Sandal-Hat?
I see.
So this is your house.
Correct!
So you saved me?
Huh?
That tone is unexpected.
It sounds as though you didn't want me to rescue you.
Oh yeah...
Ishida was there, too.
What happened to him?
Is he here, too?
No, he went home.
He lost a lot of blood, but his wounds weren't too serious.
Even if he lay there like that, he wouldn't have died for a couple of days.
So I was able to treat most of his wounds there.
He was worried about you when he left.
Ishida?
No way!
I asked him to rest here awhile...
Thank you very much.
But I'm all right.
But rather...
please take care of Kurosaki.
If there's anyone who can defeat those guys right now, it's not me.
The only one who can save Rukia is "him." So he said.
Only me?
What does he expect me to do?
Rukia has gone back to the Soul Society!
How do I go after her?
!
How do I save her?
!
No way can I do that...
No way!
Do you really believe that?
There's a way to get to the Soul Society...
Is there a way?
How?
How do I get there?
!
Tell me!
Of course, I'll tell you.
But there's one condition.
Condition?
Yes.
For the next ten days, study how to fight with me.
S-Study?
!
What?
You want me to train?
I don't have time!
Rukia may be executed over there at any time?
We have to get to the Soul Society and!
You just don't get it, do you?
Huh?
!
What I mean is, if you go there now, you will die.
Can you beat them?
If you fought with them now?
This time, I let you try and fight them.
That's because I figured you would understand that better than words.
With your level of strength now, you won't be of any good in the Soul Society.
You are weak.
A weak person entering the enemy's den...
that's called suicide.
You want to save Rukia?
Don't make me laugh.
Don't use others as a reason for walking straight into death's arms.
The Soul Society usually has a one-month waiting period before an execution.
This holds true in Rukia's case, too.
Execution?
It's different from the way humans are executed, though.
I have ten days to bully you.
Then seven days to open the gate to Soul Society.
And 13 days after we arrive in Soul Society.
We will have lots of time.
Can I become stronger in ten days?
Certainly!
That is if you truly wish to save Rukia from the bottom of your heart.
Your feelings are stronger than steel.
Abandon any doubt you have.
Ten days.
Can you play a game of life and death with me?
Of course!
I felt as though... the rain stopped.
With much appreciation send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
I'll always be grateful for who you are.
I was casually walking through town
Around the time dusk fell and the city was bathed in red
It was an afternoon with crowds of people coming and going
I don't know why but I just stood there and watched
Then my cell phone started to vibrate and I made myself move hoping it could fill in this hole in my heart
You're not alone You see, everybody
We gotta hold each other up
With much appreciation
I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
I'll always be grateful for who you are.
Renji Abarai shows you the "Proper way to use the Zanpaku-to"!
First, you call out the name of your Zanpaku-to to release its power!
Then you slash and swing!
Slash, and slash, and slash, and slash!
Cripes!
That's not explaining anything!
Do the preview!
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky

Konpaku, Mod Souls... were fake souls created to battle Hollows.
However, the project was abandoned as inhumane and the order was given to destroy all of the Mod Souls, but...
Urahara Store
Well, I guess that's it.
Um...
Mr. Kisuke...
Hmm?
Uh...
I'm sorry...
This is all my fault...
You're angry...
aren't you?
Huh?
Not at all.
Why are you getting so scared?
We're in this together, aren't we?
Don't worry.
I'll take care of everything.
Mr. Kisuke...
Now, now...
There, there...
Manager, everything is ready.
All right.
Shall we go to collect our merchandise then?
- Yes.
- Okay.
Uh... that guy...
What's he doing all by himself?
If I stay calm, I can easily read your moves!
Damn!
Come back, you!
Wait, Ichigo!
We have an order!
What?
!
At a time like this?
!
A Hollow is about to appear!
It's near!
Oh, damn!
Let's go!
Teacher!
Hashigami!
Kaneda!
Ino!
What are you yelling about?
A strange high school student attacked us!
He had orange hair...
A high school student?
Huh?
Oh!
What can this be?
I think you boys play too many video games.
Damn...
That Soul Reaper and those kids ruined my good mood...
Damn!
Oh!
A Hollow!
I sense a Hollow...
It's around where I was...
Is it going to attack those kids?
Kill him off.
Hah-hah-hah...
So what?
I'll make a better one.
Hah! "Clean up after school," she says!
Why should we do this?
Why doesn't she believe us?
Probably because we're always misbehaving.
That's right.
And she even confiscated our games.
What's wrong?
!
My Soul Pager isn't working right.
What?
!
Is the battery dead?
What're you talking about?
!
You should have bought some spare batteries instead of pining after a Chappie!
I can't figure out the location of the Hollow.
Damn!
W-What was that?
I-It's that high school student!
W-What's that?
!
Blood?
!
What's that?
That's it!
Okay!
Huh?
!
That's...
That idiot!
Huh?
Hey, Ichigo!
You interfere with my meal, then you run all over the place.
I don't know who you are, but you're not strong enough to be messing with me!
Exactly!
Oh!
Y-You...
Why... are you helping me -
You!
You're hurt!
Whose body do you think this is?
!
If a two-bit one like this can bloody you up this bad, don't even think about fighting!
What do you mean?
!
I had to fight it because you took so long getting here!
Shut up!
You're supposed to be a battle-ready Mod Soul!
How pitiful!
What's with you two?
!
Shut up!
Hey!
What's wrong?
!
You idiot!
How reckless can you be?
!
Once you crack its head, the Hollow will disappear on its own!
And you had to...
- go kick it again.
- There's no one here.
Are you boys pulling my leg?
No!
It's true!
You have to believe us!
Then, where is this bleeding high school student?
But it's true...
Right?
All right.
I want you to stay and clean after school again tomorrow, okay?
What?
!
Wait a minute!
Teacher!
Didn't you hate them?
So what?
If I didn't help then, they would've been killed.
And I won't let anyone get killed.
Soon after I was created, the Soul Society ordered all Mod Souls be destroyed.
In other words... my date of death was determined the day after I was created.
I...
I trembled in fear every day, inside that pill, as I watched the others around me disappear, day by day.
Even though I was able to slip out of the warehouse by hiding among other pills,
I was always afraid that I would someday be discovered and destroyed.
All the while, I wondered:
Why should others determine my fate?
Why?
Why can't I decide for myself?
!
Isn't it up to me whether I live or die?
!
That's why...
That's why I... won't kill anyone...
And I don't want to see anyone killed.
Oh, my...
Here I finally found you and you're all battered up.
Looks like all the equipment we prepared was for nothing.
Huh?
!
Huh?
Wha...!
Collection completed.
Let's go home, everyone.
What?
!
But I thought I'd finally be able to fight it out, after all this time.
W-Wait...
Wait a minute!
What are you going to do with that?
Do with it?
Destroy it.
Y-You can see me?
Who are you guys?
Well, how can I answer that?
A greedy merchant.
Hey, you can't take that!
What's this, Urahara?
Do you take back goods you've sold to people without giving them a refund?
Oh, well, I guess I'll refund you then.
That's not necessary.
I'm satisfied with this item.
Besides, you guys work outside the laws of the Soul Society.
You're not really obligated to collect these things, are you?
Don't blame me if you run into trouble.
We're going to be hiding out.
Don't worry.
I've gotten used to trouble lately.
Here...
Let's go home.
Uh, okay...
Hm?
What's the matter, Ichigo?
Man...
Abusing my body, knowing it wasn't his...
Hey, I'm talking to you!
Are you listening?
!
You must look very strange to outsiders.
I don't like it!
Rukia, what do I do to complain to him directly?
Hm?
Well, you'd need to insert it into a body without a soul - in other words, a dead body.
Got it!
A dead body!
Let's see now...
I'm not going to find one lying around!
Quit yapping.
Huh?
This is...
Hey...
In other words, all I need is a receptacle, right?
Huh?
Yes, but that's not...
Oh, but this body I'm in isn't a real body either...
Rukia...
Please pardon the inconvenience during the construction.
O-Okay, let's give it a try.
You sure?
So, what do I do?
You put it into its mouth, I guess...
Okay...
like this?
Humph.
It didn't work.
Looks like it.
That hurts, you idiot!
You!
Ichigo Kurosaki!
I challenge you again!
Huh, what?
Y-You're huge!
No, I'm small!
What's going on?
!
My hands have gotten so cute!
Ohh...
I'm all soft!
Hey you, Mod Soul!
Huh?
I don't think our discussion was over!
Let me go!
I'm going to take real good care of you!
Prepare yourself!
Then I guess I'll take you on as I am!
Hey!
Wake up, Ichigo!
It's morning!
Morning!
Morning!
How's that?
Give up?
If you give up, then wake up and apologize!
If you don't, I'll get in your school bag and follow you to school.
The girls in your class will say,
"Oh, Kurosaki... you carry a stuffed animal around?
How weird!"
Ow!
Let go of me, you!
Oh!
Yammering away first thing in the morning...
I told you to shut up and act like a stuffed animal, didn't I, Kon?
!
Why the heck are you calling me Kon?
!
It's hard to call you Kaizo Konpaku.
Kon's good enough for you.
That's no reason for you to call me Kon!
Doesn't it sound sort of silly?
I know!
Why don't you call me Kai, instead?
I like Kai.
Call me Kai.
- No way.
- Why not?
!
Because Kai sounds kinda cool.
I wouldn't like it.
Damn you...
Don't get smart!
You...
What's all this racket, so early in the morning?
I can't even take my time changing clothes...
Huh?
Huh?
N-Nice angle...
I'm glad I'm a stuffed animal...
Ow!
Stop it!
Stop it!
My stuffing's coming out!
My stuffing!
Ichigo, I'm coming in.
Kojima and Asano are...
Huh?
What are you doing?
N-N-Nothing.
I'm not doing anything.
What are you doing, so early in the morning?
It isn't early anymore.
Kojima and Asano are waiting for you.
What?
!
Oh!
It's this late already?
!
Ohhh!
I'm going to be late!
Your toast is ready, so eat before you go.
Sorry!
I overslept!
I'll be right out, so wait for me!
Hey, this is unusual!
Well, take your time, but hurry, okay?
Sure!
Say...
What is it?
You erased the memories of my classmates again, didn't you?
Of course.
You wouldn't want them to remember what happened yesterday, would you?
Well...
I guess not.
Too many things have been happening.
And it's like... it's only natural...
Ichigo, I'm going on ahead.
Ichigo?
What's wrong?
Nothing...
Ichigo...
Say, Tatsuki, your elective was art, right?
Huh?
Yeah.
Did you do your assignment, "Me in the Future"?
Yes, I did.
Why?
Let's show each other what we've done.
I have no confidence at all.
Sure.
Here!
Wow, you're good!
I'm going to be the female vale tudo champion someday!
This is so nice.
Mine is too awful to show you.
What about you, Orihime?
What did you draw?
Thanks for asking!
Actually, in my heart, I call it my masterpiece!
Oh really?
Show me.
Ta-da!
"The Future Me" Maximum speed: 380kph!
From my mouth, flames of 20,000 degrees Celsius, and from my eyes, special destructive rays!
No, Orihime!
That's definitely not what you were supposed to draw!
- Huh?
What?
Why?
- Do you want to get detention again?
But wait, there's more...
Oh!
Good morning, Ichigo!
Huh?
Oh!
Oh, good morning, Inoue!
What's with him?
He's sure in a good mood today.
Isn't he, Orihime?
Huh?
Orihime?
Mmm...
But...
Michiru, what's the date today?
Huh?
It's June 16...
I see...
He's not in a good mood.
He acts like that when he's really tense.
Oh...
Tatsuki?
Don't worry...
I know the reason why.
Tomorrow, he's going to skip school.
Ta-da!
And now,
Kurasaki Clinic will be closed tomorrow on the 17th.
I would like to discuss our duties for tomorrow!
And since, as your father,
I am the chairman, I get to make all the decisions!
What do you mean?
You can't call this a discussion!
Hey!
Raise your hand if you want to speak, Chief of Staff!
C-Chief of Staff?
Not exactly unhappy
Yuzu will be the lunch staff officer, as usual.
Aye aye, sir!
Karin will be the porter!
Huh?
!
What happened to "Chief of Staff"?
Oh, I just had my hair cut.
What do you think of it?
- Don't come near me!
Stop it!
- Come on.
Take a look!
It looked like fun.
What was?
What?
The family meeting you had, of course.
So, what?
Are you playing hooky from school and going on a picnic tomorrow?
A picnic?
!
That sounds good!
- Say, Rukia...
- Huh?
About my job as Soul Reaper...
Can I take the day off tomorrow?
Wha...?
What are you saying?
!
Of course, you can't!
What's going on with you?
!
You've been acting strange since this morning.
It's the day she died...
Tomorrow's the anniversary of the day my mom died.
That's not quite right...
To be precise, it's not the day she died... it's the day she was killed.
Oh!
Good morning, Inoue!
Tomorrow, he's going to skip school.
If...
If I were the rain... would I be able to connect with someone's heart, the way the rain connects the never intersecting sky and earth?
Huh?
!
I...
Yay!
Yay!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Shucks...
Yay!
We did it!
Okay, one more time!
I won't lose this time!
What's the matter, mister?
Sorry, something just came up.
Aww no...
Here you go.
Yay!
So, who is it today?
The thirteenth division's Rukia Kuchiki.
Kuchiki?
And what has that young lady done?
She has stayed too long in the human world.
Is that all?
We wouldn't call you out if that were all...
There's something behind it.
Find out what it is.
I can be a little rough, I take it?
Leave at once.
That Rukia Kuchiki...
Though the voyage must continue on
May seas always be calm
When the cycle of the moon has renewed may it shine
It's light to guide your boat
I offer this voyage a prayer
With each new day that still awaits
On vividly shining seas
To the end of the journey
Next!
Amazing suspense!
"The Isshin Kurosaki Serial Murder Case-
The Madness over a Huge Serving of Pot Stickers and
The Sweat of a Sorrowful Father
Sealed in a Bean Jam Ricecake by a Beautiful Nurse!"
There's no such show!
There'll even be some "wardrobe malfunctions"!
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently...
until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate, life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
All right, explain to me...
the rules of this battle.
We'll use this.
Huh?
What is that?
It's bait for Hollows.
If I crush it and scatter it around, Hollows will come.
What?
!
The victor will be whoever kills the most Hollows that gather in 24 hours.
Well?
Isn't that easy to understand?
Quit kidding around!
You'd endanger the lives of the town's people just for our battle?
!
Just who do you think you are?
!
Don't make such a fuss, braggart.
No need to worry about other people.
I'll kill every single Hollow that comes.
If you are confident that you can protect others from Hollows, then you should accept this challenge.
That's number one.
What kind of face is that, Ichigo Kurosaki?
Change it back!
Chase away the Hollows!
Soon, the town will be overflowing with Hollows lured here by the bait.
Let's just say the die is cast.
Huh?
!
Isn't there something else you should be doing, besides grabbing onto me?
That's if you really want to protect as many people as possible from the Hollows...
Why you...!
Have you forgotten?
Hollows tend to attack those with high spiritual energy.
Yuzu!
Karin!
Dammit!
Hey, wait Ichigo!
He hasn't noticed, after all...
That there are people around him with high spiritual powers besides his family.
But don't worry.
I'll kill every one of them.
And... you'll realize how weak your own power is, here at the point of no return.
I detest Soul Reapers!
It's true.
You're the cutest of all, Mika!
Truly?
Can I really believe you, Yoshi?
Of course...
How's about a hug?
Huh?
Someone will see us!
Dammit!
Quit making out in broad daylight!
You're just ghosts!
It's all right.
No one is looking.
Mika!
Yoshi!
Hey!
Arisawa!
Break's over!
Arisawa!
Coming!
Tatsuki!
Orihime?
Do you have a moment?
That's right... that day when I went to Orihime's house...
I have almost no recollection of that day.
Just that I felt so much pain... and that I thought I saw someone who looked like Rukia...
At first, I thought I was dreaming.
But when I mentioned it to Orihime the following day she had seen the very same dream.
And ever since that day,
I started to see strange things.
Tatsuki...
- I can see you!
- Hey Tatsuki!
You and I are butt friends!
Aghh!
It's so annoying!
Huh?
!
Oh, I'm sorry.
What is it?
Umm... it's not that important, but...
Hey, what's going on?
!
The windows on the first floor are shattered!
- Anyone hurt?
!
- I wonder what happened.
Let's go, Orihime.
Okay.
Okay!
Let's go!
Hey Kurosaki!
Hurry and kick it!
Number three!
Huh?
!
She's probably gone somewhere to play around this time.
Where could she be?
!
Dammit!
Seven.
Eight.
Nine.
Ten.
Eleven.
What is it, Urahara?
Huh?
Dammit!
A Hollow...
at a time like this!
Sorry Urahara, we'll continue this later.
What?
The signal is gone.
I get it.
Ichigo is doing pretty well.
Gone again?
What's happening?
It's not really broken, is it?
Again?
So many Hollows, at this rate is... not... possible.
What does this heavy and agitated Spirit Energy mean?
Just what is happening?
!
Move!
Where are you?
!
Hurry it up, Chad!
If you keep stalling, lunch specials will be over!
I'll make you pay the difference!
Huh?
That won't do.
Damn right that won't do!
So move it!
What a bad feeling.
I've had this feeling before...
Hmm?
Cut it out, will you?
!
I'm eking out a living with what I make from my part-time job!
My life's as tenuous as a bug's!
I'm not like you carefree students who can eat just by being alive!
Sorry.
I risk my life just for a bowl of rice!
Repeat it!
I-I risk my life just for a bowl of rice.
All right.
If you get it, let's go!
Unless it's on sale, don't buy meat!
The expiration date is just an approximation!
Right!
What's happening?
Was that a gas explosion?
What is that?
Just that area is...
Hey Chad!
Are you all right?
!
Let's get out of here!
Shigeo!
Harutoki!
Run...!
He's coming after me?
I see.
Well then...
Chad!
Where are you going?
!
I don't know what that big thing is, but if it's targeting me, then it's simple.
I just have to run.
Run to where there's no one around.
Run!
Oops, sorry.
Kurosaki!
What's with you anyway?
You space out then kick the ball just anywhere.
Are you serious about playing?
!
Huh?
W-What, y-you wanna fight?
Then bring it on!
We'll show you...
I'm sorry.
I think I'll go home, after all.
Huh?
H-Hey!
Wait, Kurosaki!
It's no good today...
I keep thinking about that weird air and can't concentrate on soccer.
I'll take a bath and go to bed early.
You're Ichigo's friend.
The one with the parakeet.
Ichigo's sister?
What's a grown up like you doing here alone...?
W-What is that?
!
W-Wha...?
!
What is it?
!
It stopped moving.
Is it watching our moves?
Or...
Damn it!
If I could see him a bit more clearly...
It's coming again.
Huh?
What is it?
Just what is that thing?
!
Can you... see it?
See?
What are you saying?
!
It's so clearly visible!
You...
Mister, behind you!
Gone?
Where'd it go?
Where are you looking, Mister?
!
To your right!
Run!
Mister, don't tell me you can't see him?
!
I can see just a bit of it.
Which means, you really don't see him.
It can't be helped then.
Hold me tight.
I'll see him for you!
Wha...?
!
You can't!
I can!
Let me do it!
It's not the first time I've seen a monster like that.
It's bothering me... what do they have to do with Ichigo?
!
Ichigo?
To the left.
Dodge!
Right!
Mister!
Are you all right, Mister?
Mister!
Mister!
Kurosaki!
What happened?
This guy's covered in blood!
Did you fight him?
Did you beat him up?
Stupid!
Don't come!
Get away!
What a thing to say!
We're just worried about you!
You're always like that!
Leave it to a girl!
I'll say!
Let's go!
Don't tell me you hit someone again, Yasutora?
What's the point of hitting someone?
You hurt those who hurt you, and what's left?
Yasutora, you are strong.
You are big.
You are beautiful.
You were born with everything people wish from God.
People who are different are suppressed
I don't know about other things, but that's the way things are in this world.
But Yasutora...
You must be kind.
You must learn why you have such big, strong fists.
Find out.
I know, Grandpa.
My fists aren't big so that I can hurt others.
My body... is big... so that I can protect.
I know all that.
I know that...
But that's why... even just a little...
I want you to lend me your strength!
What... is that arm?
Mister!
Mister!
Your arm!
Is it all right?
So un-cool!
Why would you make a gesture like that?
!
Mister!
I don't understand...
That armor on my right arm appeared out of nowhere.
And from it... something amazing was released.
And suddenly, I could see that monster so clearly.
I don't understand...
not at all.
Just...
You're not hurt, Ichigo's sister?
Stupid!
You're the only one who's hurt.
I see.
That's good.
It's not good!
What's good about getting hurt?
!
If even one person gets hurt, it's NOT good!
That's just the logic of guys who want to be all heroic!
In that sense, you're just like Ichigo!
Aghh!
I can't stand it!
You just wait here!
I'll call my dad and have him treat you!
Don't move from that spot, Mister!
Ichigo's sister, huh...?
Just like Ichigo... the way she kicks.
Though the voyage must continue on
May seas always be calm
When the cycle of the moon has renewed may it shine
It's light to guide your boat
I offer this voyage a prayer
With each new day that still awaits
On vividly shining seas
To the end of the journey
Into a somber Karakura town under attack by monsters suddenly appears the Fighter of Hope, Orihime!
With six henchmen, she tosses out evil one by one.
Inoue, what are you talking about?
Next week's preview.
That's too convenient.
Kuchiki Rukia...
We found you.
Gimme the sword.
Shinigami.
I'm not "Shinigami.
I'm Kuchiki Rukia.
do you have the hots for Kurosaki?
Excuse me?
{Previously 'Scuse}
My name is Kuchiki.
I will be sitting next to you.
Y-You!
...how does one drink this?
How"?
obviously.
Bwahahahahahahaha!
Oh no!
You must go to the nurse's office.
I'll belie...
DUMBASS!
yeah...
Kuchiki-san.
'kay?
I will think about it.
Ah!
that's the same answer again.
I will think about it." That's all you say.
dear.
Is that so?
Say "Ah".
Is it good?
Yay!
If I must eventually leave this place then all these things would be nothing more than shackles sympathy friendship the feeling of closeness...
Kurosaki-kun is just a friend!
Such bothersome things...
None of these are even necessary emotions for a Shinigami...
Kuchiki Rukia...
I have involved myself in this world a bit too long after all.
YES!
You do get it.
Well...
To put it another way...
Since you stayed on this side so long you basically got to live just a little longer...
Rukia!
Renji...
Abarai Renji?
!
and... {closing' - closing} ...you were so lost in thought that you didn't realize it until I spoke?
in just these two or three months you've gotten way too soft.
Spit it out...
Rukia.
Where's the human who took your powers?
What are you talking about!
?
Just because I'm in a faux body doesn't mean my powers were taken.
}
What makes you think the one who supposedly took them was human?
He is human.
you... wouldn't have that stupid human expression on your face!
You're just another kid from Rukongai like me and still you were lucky enough to get taken in by the Noble House of Kuchiki.
weren't you supposed to become one of the Shinigami elite?
!
Eh?
!
damn it!
There's no way it's right for you wear that human expression!
Captain Kuchiki?
Byakuya... nii-sama...
Rukia... you know. {Removed quotes around "The and human".
Also ya to you. }
was probably the Brass' version of kindness.
Rukia.
We're here to capture you... {NOTE:
Changed from two lines to one.
Single sentence being cut into three pieces was hard to follow IMO} ...and kill the guy who took your powers.
Don't protect him.
don't ya?
You didn't dodge my first two attacks...
I let you dodge them.
The next will kill you.
now...
Two men with weapons attacking an unarmed girl not a very pleasant thing to see.
I don't really like that sort of thing.
You can see us?
{Changed ellipses to question mark.}
Who the hell are you?
Just a classmate.
Classmate?
that is.
Ishida?
Why are you here?
Just a coincidence.
It's nothing for you to worry about.
If you must know...
Sunflower Sewing and was simply walking around this neighborhood in the middle of the night.
It's not like I took off beacuse I was concerned when I sensed Shinigami energy and brought this bag from home as an excuse to be outside. {changed 'just for' to 'as'}
Whoa...
I didn't know he was mentally challenged... but...
I'm asking you a question over here. {NOTE:
Sentence sound crappy.}

I'll just kill you first.

What are you talking about?
!
I gave you your answer.
I'm just one of Kuchiki Rukia's classmates.
that is.
I call that not answering. {Note:
Needs emphases...he's not yelling so I don't know about caps.}
I'm Ishida Uryuu.
Pleasure to meet you.
What's with you all of a sudden?
Nothing...
I just thought even a Shinigami would at least want to know the name of the man who defeated him.
That's it...
I'm gonna kill you!
Freaking Rukia... is she ever coming home?
{Changed Friggin' to Freaking}
It's already like two AM.
tonight I'll take a break from the Shinigami busin-
What?
!
What's that sound?
!
Here?
You?
!
Kon?
!
What are you doing there?
{Changed What're to what are}
Didn't you go on a journey?
I owe ya.
You seriously saved my ass.
sounds a lot more like welcome that way.}
I couldn't tell who came in so I had to judge just by aura and sounds to find out whether or not it was you.
he only repeats twice audibly}
Is that how you treat a best friend who's endured long hours of suffering?
!
Shut up!
Who said you're my best friend?
!
You stink!
It's not MY fault!
{Changed "it aint" to "it's not"}
Nee-san-
Ichigo!
It's Nee-san!
Nee-san's in trouble!
GET AWAY FROM ME!
Look at this!
This here!
this WHOLE time?
!
What's that?
It's obvious!
It's a goodbye message!
Goodbye message?
Then why were you in the toilet instead of on a journey?
I'm not the one who wrote that!
Geez!
I... stopped at home for a bit to say goodbye to Nee-san before leaving.
And it wasn't because I was running home with my tail between my legs!
It's about honor.
So I stopped by for a minute.
Nee-san...
Nee-san...
Nee-san...
left us behind and went away.
Why?
!
Without one word to me?
!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Who cares?
!
you know.
But she still left me behind with no explanation!
WHO THE HELL CARES ABOUT YOU!
Neee-saaaan!
freakin' Rukia...
What the hell is she thinking?
!
{hell's hell is}
Enjoy deciphering this.

What's this?
Here's a hint!
{Another sign that needs added.}
The hell is that?
!
Crap... with that many "ta"s in the letter.
It must be a tanuki!
{NOTE:
ANOTHER SIGN} 150)}This is a pun. "Tanuki" is a Japanese relative of the raccoon. "Ta-nuki" means remove 'ta'.
I'll read It without the "ta"s.
Let's see...
I mu st leave.
and do not worry.

hide out for a while.
What's up with that?
I still don't really know why she left.
You don't know?
Something happened.
Burn the letter...
Hide out...
Why is Nee-san worrying about us so much?
It's obvious.
Something happened!
Between her and Soul Society!
and the people around her Nee-san Nee-san left by herself!

Nothing will get solved just standing around talking like this.

Hello there.
I see you're in a bit of a bind.
Anythlng I can do to help?
I told you so.
He's strong...
This bastard's improved his skills again.
I couldn't stop him or even move from this spot!
then guess I'll finish the job.
remember this well...
Abarai Renji"...
It's the name of the man who killed you.
Wait!
Pleased to meet ya!
Who the hell are you?
!
Kurosaki Ichigo the man who's going to take you down.
Nice to meet you. {Ya - you}
Shinigami clothes?
!
What squad are you with?
What the HELL is up with that huge ass Soul Slayer?
!
{Soul Slayer or Zanpakwhatever?
}
What?
huh?
I thought it was pretty big compared to Rukia's.
until now... {til - until}
I didn't have anyone to compare with.
but I'm not sure if that deviates from the translation too much.
Maybe Lunar already deviated too much though...}
How could such a kid have such a huge ass sword... you fool!
Why did you come?
!
So that's it.
I get it.
So you're the human who got his powers from Rukia?
!
Come on!
{Note:
It's repeated.
Hard to repeat 'come on' in english...might want to change it.}
What's wrong?
!
Is your big ass sword just for show?
!
Eh?
!
Dammit...
What the hell is with this guy?
!
{hell's - hell is}
Ichigo!
Don't...
Ishida...
It's over.
You'll die and the powers will go back to Rukia.
Then...
Rukia will die in Soul Society.
man!
You're one dumb shit.
Rukia went to the trouble of leaving by herself to keep you out of it.
All you had to do was sit quietly at home but instead you came after her.
Did you think you could do anything at all?
You're just an overnight Shinigami.
You couldn't put one scratch on us real ones.
my bad. {Sounds teh ghetto}
Sorry to interrupt you... my hand just moved on its own.
Tell me the rest.
What was that about "one scratch?
You piece of shit...
Renji.
Captain Kuchiki!
That child "Kurosaki Ichigo" I thought I had seen his face before.
we had a report from the Secret Mobile Corps that he inflicted a sword wound on a Menos Grande and sent it back to Hueco Mundo.
I can't take it.
The quality of the S.M.C.'s been sliding lately.
This kid... wounded a Menos Grande?
!
I couldn't believe that story even if I wanted to!
Captain.
His Soul Slayer... but otherwise it's a total disgrace!
It's obvious he can't control his spirit energy.
What's your Soul Slayer's name?
Huh?
Name?
Did you even ask?
You mean ask Rukia?
You name every one of these things?
I knew it.
You can't even ask your own Soul Slayer its name.
A bastard like that trying to fight me as an equal is 2000 YEARS TOO EARLY!

That's what they call the power gap.
A Zanpakutou changes its size and shape based on its owner's spirit power.
And this is the figure of my spirit power.
kid.
It's about time for me to leave.
The air doesn't suit me.
I hoped the first attack would show Ichigo the power gap...
That way...
He would know he was no match and back down while his wounds were still shallow.
That was what I was hoping for...
Ichigo would not back down just for that.
I knew that...
Here it comes.
Ichigo?
Run away!
I beg you!
Nothing to say?
run!
What are you doing Rukia!
?
let go of me!
Are you trying to get yourself into deeper shit?
!
you dumb shit!
Ichigo!
Stand!
Get up and run away!
Ichigo!
What the hell...
You still have the strength to move?
Just what the doctor ordered.
I was just thinking what a drag it would be just finishing off someone who is almost dead anyway.
Alrighty then.
Let's have one last down and dirty bloodletting before you die.
run away!
Ichigo!
Ichi-
What's wrong?
then I'll go first.
What's with this increase in spirit power...
What the hell?
!
What the hell is he...
A second ago he was about to die!
Where the hell did all this power come from?
!
What's wrong?
!
Your movements have gotten extremely slow all of a sudden!
you've gotten faster.
but it feels good.
my wounds don't hurt and I'm not even a tiny bit worried about losing to you!
You bastard!
Zabimaru!
Renji's being pushed back on his heels...
Ichigo... aren't you?
!
What's going on?
!
How high is his spirit power going to go?
!
But that's enough of that!
So heavy...
I won't make it!
W-What?
!
My Zanpakutou... he didn't do anything...
Him?
Impossible.
he couldn't possibly do anything.
He's coming...
What the hell...
Did I just get beaten?
Was I stabbed from behind?
Was it from the front...
I don't know...
It hurts...
How slow even in defeat.
Byakuya-nii-sama!
Been a long time since I saw that...
He really is... incredible.
I could only follow the second attack.
I couldn't even see when he drew or sheathed his sword.
If even I am in this condition then that kid probably has no idea what even happened.
Even so what was the deal with his monstrous spirit power...
Renji?
No...
Captain.
I could have finished him myself.
Do not say that.
Even my skills will rust if I simply stand and watch all the time.
That's not it...
He's...
I'll...
Ichigo!
Ichigo!
Forget it!
Renji!
Ichigo is-
What the hell are you talking about?
!
Look closer!
That brat is dead!
Don't you get it!
?
Just touching him right now will add 20 years to your sentence!
What the hell reason is there to worsen your crimes for a dead guy?
!
I involved Ichigo...
It's MY fault he died!
What is wrong with me running over to him?
!
Even though your crimes may worsen you cannot bear not to go to him?
...to this child's side?
Nii-sama...
Rukia.
I see.
This child does closely resemble him.
Rukia.
I see.
This child does closely resemble him.
He's already dead"...
He resembles that guy"...
Don't continue the conversation without me!
Ichi-
Let go.
I can't hear you.
Look at me when you talk.
That kid can still move?
!
Impossible...
Oh...
I see you don't want to keep that arm very much.
Rukia?
!
Filthy human...
How dare a filthy human seize Nii-sama's leg.
boy!
Nii-sama.
Kuchiki Rukia's eyes have been opened by this human's action.
take me to Soul Society
I shall humbly atone for my crimes.
Wait...
Dammit!
What're you saying?
!
dammit!
You just don't know when to give up.
Quit wriggling around and just lie there and die quietly.
I doubt we need to trouble ourselves to deal him a final blow.
eventually he will breathe his last breath.
Nii-sama.
Rukia!
What kinda joke is this?
!
dammit!
Hey!
DO NOT MOVE!
Just try moving one step.
Just try coming after me.
I...
I will NOT forgive you!
Eventually you will die so lay there and live as long as you will.
Very well.
I shall not finish him.
the chain link and the soul sleep.
That boy will probably die in under an hour.
all his power will be gone.
let alone Shinigami powers.
Renji.
sir.
Unlock!
I can't... speak...
I can't move...
I... got protected again.
Rukia...
It hurts...
My body's so heavy...
It's cold...
It doesn't hurt... damn.
Am I finally going to die?
or anything else... a minute ago my body was so cold but now it's kinda warm...
It's warm... instant reaction.
Very good.
Too close!
Too close!
Too close!
Owner!
Kurosaki-dono has awakened.
Owner!
I've seen you before!
You are one of Sandal-hat's people!
Why the hell are you in my bed?
!
Get OUT!
What?
!
I'm not dead...
Why not... this isn't my house.
Where am I?
Kurosaki-san.
Your wounds still haven't closed yet.
you'll die.
Sandal-hat... so this is your house...
Exactly!
You're the one who saved me?
Oh?
Not the response I was expecting.
It almost sounds like you didn't want to be saved.
yeah.
Ishida was laying nearby too.
Where is he?
Is he here too?
he went home.
his wounds weren't serious. he wouldn't have died for at least two days.
So I was able to treat most of his wounds on the spot.
Kurosaki-san.
Ishida worried about me?
No way... but...
Thank you very much.
But I'm fine.
please take care of Kurosaki.
If we have any chance to beat them it's not me.
Only he can save Kuchiki-san.
huh?
What am I supposed to do?
Rukia has gone back to Soul Society.
How am I supposed to go after her?
!
?
!
How am I supposed to save her?
!
?
!
I can't.
I CAN'T!
You really think there's no way?
No way to get to Soul Society?
Is there?
What do I do?
How do I go there?
!
Tell me please!
I'll tell you.
But I have one condition.
Condition?
Yes.
study fighting with me.
St-...
What the hell?
You're telling me to train?
We don't have time for that!
We don't know when Rukia will be killed over there!
we have to get to Soul Society ASAP and save Ru-
You just don't get it.
I'm trying to tell you... you'll die there.
Can you win a fight with them the way you are?
I... went ahead and let you fight them.
That's because I thought that would be faster than telling you... you wouldn't be the least bit useful in Soul Society.
You are weak.
When a weakling enters enemy territory they call that "suicide".
To save Kuchiki-san?
You have got to grow up.
Don't use other people as an excuse to die.
Soul Society customarily... takes a one month grace period before execution of death row prisoners.
That should be the same for Kuchiki-san.
Execute?
!
though.
ten days to bully you.
Seven days to open the gate to Soul Society.
Then 13 days once we reach Soul Society.
Plenty of time.
can I get stronger?
Of course if you desire from the bottom of your heart to save Kuchiki-san.
The power of love is stronger than steel.
Leave your doubts and hesitation out in the gutter. can you handle a life-or-death situation with me?
You have to ask?
I felt like the rain... had stopped.

You will perish!

Don't mind me...

Why what?
Why would you protect a mod soul?

You OK?

Got it!
What happened to Kagerouza?
Ichigo... he's over there.
Kagerouza!
He just doesn't know when to stop!
Nozomi... you are unharmed.
Splendid...
Nozomi.
You cannot fight with a Zanpakutou like that.
Shinigami Substitute...
Why must you always stand in my way?
Nozomi doesn't want to go with you.
So I'll make sure she doesn't.
That's all there is to it!
She does not want to go with me?
Why ever not?
How can you say such things?
!
You what?
!
Are you high or something?
There's no way she'd ever want to go with you!
This concerns the one who created Nozomi.
you might say.
I shall complete his research.
Complete it?
You mean that whole thing about ruling Soul Society and the Human World?
The hell you will!
You think that crap'll make Nozomi happy?
Why not?
I am happy.
surely Nozomi must also be happy.
You're one twisted son of a bitch!
Nozomi is nothing like you!
I do beg your pardon.
What's so funny?
You
- You speak almost as if you thought you could understand Nozomi.
it is I alone who truly understand her.
What are you talking about?
It is simplicity itself.
Nozomi and I were originally born from the same Shinigami's spirit particles.
What the hell?
It is exactly as it sounds.
Nozomi!
What's this numbskull blabbering about?
do you?
say something!
Nozomi.
just say something!
it seems she remembers.
will you cut it out with the hyena act?
Yes!
Nozomi knew all along.
She knew that when I captured her we would become one.
She knew that she would become your enemy.
That is why she attempted to distance herself from you.
Why she persisted in her efforts to drive you away.
Nozomi?
you came to feel bonds of friendship with the people who protected you.
What's your name?
Where did you come from?
I won't tell you.
you pervert!
pervert!
Mind your own business.
Nozomi.
We'll protect you for sure.
Enough.
I'll fix it even without protection.
no-one will ever find you.
I told you Ichigo and the others will- we'll protect you!
Are you really Nozomi?
!
You've got lots of reasons to live!
You're just like each other.
Mega pervert.
I am nothing like this thing!
I don't know why I want to protect you.
But I did hear it loud and clear.
A voice saying I had to protect you.
a moron?
I'm just a burden.
Everyone's been trying to protect me.
But there's nothing I can do.
when I felt I wanted to protect you...
Even I got a sword.
That is precisely why you were unable to say anything!
you pale scrawny bastard!
Stop trying to decide her feelings for her!
and I am Nozomi. merely ask Nozomi herself.
Nozomi... asshole!

And to the way we were meant to be.

No...
I don't want to go.
Is that so?
A pity.
Then I shall have to use force.
You bastard!
You'll pay for this!
Come!
I won't!

Eat this!

Run while you can!
What?

Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently...
until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate, life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
I found you, Ishida!
I won't be satisfied until I beat the hell outta you!
Right!
You get it.
This is a fight between you and me!
So quit harping on about whoever kills the most Hollows!
Let's settle this between you and me!
Say something, Ishida!
Hey Ichigo!
What is it?
!
I'm...!
The sky is...
What is that?
!
Hollows are coming together.
Wait!
There're so many!
You scared, Kurosaki?
Huh?
If you're scared, stay and watch.
I'm the victor of this match!
Over here, Hollows!
I, Uryu Ishida, the last Quincy, will take you on!
The last Quincy?
The Quincy became extinct 200 years ago.
No, that's not quite right.
To be exact... the Quincy were destroyed by the Soul Reapers.
This was a very difficult choice for the Soul Reapers.
The Soul Reapers had to destroy the Quincy... in order to prevent the destruction of this world.
In the Soul Society,
Soul Reapers were commonly called Balancers, or regulators.
Regulators?
The sum of all the souls in the Soul Society and the human world does not change much.
And Souls can travel between the two worlds.
It is the job of the Soul Reapers to regulate that.
However, one day, the Quincy appeared.
The Quincy totally destroy Hollows.
This means that any soul who left the Soul Society for the human world would never return.
If it were left as is, the balance between the two worlds would collapse!
And the two worlds would end.
There were many meetings between the Quincy and Soul Reapers...
But the Quincy refused to heed our pleas.
And the order was given to annihilate the Quincy.
Do you think that this resulted from the arrogance of Soul Reapers?
Damn!
Their numbers aren't going down.
Sensei!
Ishida!
H He's so rash!
I heard...
The reason why you fight!
I don't know who was right...
the Quincy or Soul Reapers.
And I don't intend to tell you!
But, one thing I do know!
Your ways are...
That story's old.
Huh?
I don't care about the slaughter of 200 years ago.
I only heard it from my teacher myself.
Furthermore, when I heard that story, I sort of sided with the Soul Reapers.
That is, until my Sensei died...
Huh?
!
I felt that the Quincy were at fault for refusing to listen at all to the Soul Reapers.
But why?
!
It was the Quincy who were annihilated.
You are right.
So many died.
And as long as there were casualties, thinking about who was right or who was wrong is meaningless.
What we must think about is how we can prevent this from ever happening again.
That is all.
It's hard to see the sadness in the faces of humans and Soul Reapers.
He was a kind, gentle man who never hated or resented anyone!
As the last Quincy, Sensei was under strict watch by the Soul Reapers.
And yet, Sensei kept telling the Soul Reapers to join forces and fight together.
But the answer was always the same:
"Do not interfere with our work."
Then... on that day... five huge Hollows appeared... and it was obvious that he couldn't take them on without the help of Soul Reapers.
Soul Reapers only appeared two hours after Sensei had begun to fight.
If they had listened to Sensei, if they had acknowledged his strengths, and his thoughts...
They would have come to the rescue much sooner.
And Sensei wouldn't have had to die!
Can you understand, Ichigo Kurosaki?
I must prove to the Soul Reapers, the strength of the Quincy!
I realize that our ways of thinking are at opposite poles.
If you think my way is wrong, stay there and watch...
My true strength...
You talk too much!
What're you doing?
!
I just don't get it!
Your teacher's hope wasn't to prove the power of the Quincy to the Soul Reapers...
It was to join forces with the Soul Reapers to fight, right?
!
Well then...
Just when will you be able to do that, if not now?
!
Opposite poles?
Fine!
When you have many opponents, the best way to fight is back-to-back!
Good!
Don't get me wrong.
Unless I shot, I'd have been killed.
That's fine!
Kill or be killed.
But it's too hard by yourself.
So it can't be helped.
Isn't that enough...
of a reason to join forces?
I just want to destroy Hollows.
Why?
My mother... was killed by a Hollow.
Is that the reason why I want to destroy Hollows?
If you ask that, of course, it is.
But...
I just don't want others to go through what I did.
After my mother was killed, my dad and my sisters went through a lot.
I just don't want any more of that.
I don't wanna see that anymore.
That's how I feel.
It's hard to see the sadness in the faces...
I can't say bold things like I'll protect all the people of the world...
But I don't want to just protect those I can carry in my arms...
I want to protect lots and lots of people!
Your way of doing this would end up involving too many people!
No way!
But this is no time to be saying that.
We can only join together!
What do you say?
!
Geez... you talk too much, too.
But I understand.
Unless we survive, we won't have a sparring partner for later.
Fine!
Kurosaki!
Huh?
The sky...
Sky?
What... is that?
!
Huh?
!
That's!
W-What is that?
It's huge...
That bait can't have this kind of result...
It's too late now!
Dammit!
H-Hello...
Jinta home run!
Kurosaki, we came to help you.
Sandal Hat!
We'll take care of the small fry.
So that you, Kurosaki, can concentrate on fighting that one.
Oops, you don't have time to listen to my rambling.
It's Menos...
Menos?
A gigantic Hollow borne from hundreds of Hollows mixed and folded together...
But I've only seen such a thing in illustrations in school books.
"Menos Grande."
I can't believe it!
That such a thing would come out...
This is the jurisdiction of the Royal Special Task Force.
It's not something just one Soul Reaper can take on!
Look at the size of that thing!
No sense in thinking about how to fight such a giant.
What?
A thing like that... has to be cut and cut again, with all your strength!
There's no other way!
Let's do it, Ishida!
Hold it, Kurosaki!
Ichigo!
Stop!
He's not an opponent you can take on!
Urahara!
Do you intend to kill Ichigo?
!
Not at all.
But just watch.
This battle... is necessary.
This is... a Binding Spell.
For you and him.
Kurosaki!
I told you so...
Dammit!
Kurosaki, can you stand?
Yeah, I'm sort of okay.
What were you thinking?
!
Just how did you plan on destroying that thing like that?
Well...
I figured if I kept cutting him from the feet up, the head would fall eventually.
This isn't "Pull the Blocks Out"!
Geez!
I can't believe the way you think!
Now stand...
and think up a new strategy.
What is...?
!
It's flowing in...
Is this from Kurosaki's power?
A new strategy, huh?
Kurosaki!
Huh?
Aghh!
W-What's with that bow?
!
How'd it get so big?
!
Just listen!
We may be able to beat that thing.
Huh?
!
Can you see Ishida...
and Ichigo, who's next to him?
Yes.
He asked that we watch from here...
Does he mean watch, and then choose... the path we walk?
Actually...
Actually, I haven't forgotten a single thing.
I could only doubt my own memories.
Chad...
Hmm?
What are we supposed to do?
All right, now we can fight!
Hey, are you crazy?
What?
!
Quit babbling!
In this situation, if you release all your spiritual energy in this form,
I'll be able to shoot an enormous arrow!
We can't waste all that spiritual energy!
Don't say "waste."
Come on!
Control your spiritual energy and release it all at once!
How?
What?
Can't you do that?
Then how did you fight Hollows until now?
I just went with the flow.
The flow?
!
That's crazy!
I don't understand stuff like that!
If my spirtual energy is high, isn't it always at maximum level?
Sero?
Does he intend to release a Sero here?
!
Run!
Hurry!
If you get hit, there'll be nothing left of you!
There's no other way!
Kurosaki, grab that sword again and...
Kurosaki!
What're you doing?
!
What?
!
What is this terrible Spirit Pressure?
Kurosaki's power is increasing!
Isn't it always at maximum level?
!
That's right, there's no way that can be.
No matter how high your spiritual energy, if it's always at maximum... the energy will burn out in no time!
If he can't control his spiritual energy, it means he always has more than enough spiritual energy.
If you turn on a faucet and a large amount of water flows out... most people will quickly turn it off.
If he's like that...
If his usual spiritual energy... is always held back like that...
And if through some incident, it gets turned on...
It's almost time, I think.
What?
!
Menos is turning back!
I win!
What the hell is he?
!
Impressive!
I can see why the Boss had his eyes on him.
Yo!
What?
At least say thanks.
I just saved your butt.
The least you can say is thanks.
I don't have any more strength...
W-Whaa...!
What's going on?
!
The shape of the Zampakuto is deteriorating!
It's because he released his energy so suddenly!
At this rate, his body won't hold up!
I must do something!
I know!
This should do it...
If I release the spiritual energy which Kurosaki is unable to control...
W-What're you doing?
!
Shut up!
Your hand... it's tearing apart!
Shut up!
I told you, didn't I?
If we both don't survive, I'll lose my sparring partner!
Stay alive, so that I can beat the hell outta you!
Ichigo Kurosaki!
And you can do the same to me!
Ichigo Kurosaki!
Forgive me, Sensei!
I tried to look away... by hating Soul Reapers.
I didn't want to look at myself...
Because I couldn't save you.
Today, I will save a Soul Reaper.
Can you forgive me?
I couldn't give my life for you...
I'm a weak apprentice...
Please... can you forgive me?
Grandfather?
Sheesh...
How am I supposed to beat a guy who looks like that?
With much appreciation
I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
I'll always be grateful for who you are.
I was casually walking through town
Around the time dusk fell and the city was bathed in red
It was an afternoon with crowds of people coming and going
I don't know why but I just stood there and watched
Then my cell phone started to vibrate and I made myself move hoping it could fill in this hole in my heart
You're not alone You see, everybody
We gotta hold each other up
With much appreciation
I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
I'll always be grateful for who you are.
Hey, how are you all?
I'm Kon, the superstar of the world of Bleach!
After this comes my own new corner!
Even the Soul Society is shocked!
Mr. Kon's Soul Reaper Dictionary is about to start!
Stay tuned to this channel!
I never heard of such a thing!
It's for real this time!
I don't feel like I'm at school.
Getting my ass kicked by those Soul Society guys almost dying the fact she is not here right now and the fact that not a single person in the class remembers Rukia...
Bwahahahahaha!
are you still doing that?
Aw... come on.
It's still the bomb to me.
have you decided your summer plans?
Nothing yet.
'Hime!
come stay over at my house.
My parents are on vacation!
No way!
Why not?
It's totally obvious what you're planning.
So this is what it means to return to Soul Society...
You disappear from this world from people's minds...
The entire truth of her existence is disappearing into thin air.
now...
I guess that's all for the agenda.
don't die before September!
That's all.
Dismissed!
Damn Ishida.
He ditched after all.
I thought he at least might remember Rukia.
I-chigo!
Whoosh!
Wh-Whoosh!
where's the watermelon?
Ahhh...
Noooo!
That's not it!
it's all about the ocean!
it's all about summer!
propose a joint trip to the ocean-side for ten days starting tomorrow!
From fireworks and bravery tests to co-ed hotspring bathing it will be filled with every possible thrilling and embarassing situation imaginable!
Sorry.
so I will pass.
too.
The ocean isn't my thing.
so I can't either.
I... too.
I'm going to Hawaii tomorrow.
With who?
!
who's an older woman?
! and me.
It's an eleven-person trip.
Whaat?
!
What the hell is that?
!
huh dammit?
!
How come you only get pissed at me?
!
It's weird...
I don't feel uneasy.
Even without Rukia our world revolves the right way.
I guess it should.
Rukia was originally from over there.
There was no place for her here to begin with.
So what should I do then...
Inoue...
What is it?
Did something happen?
Where did Kuchiki-san go?
Why did everyone suddenly forget about Kuchiki-san?
I thought you would know...
So Kuchiki-san returned to the world she was originally from?
Yeah.
But I'm surprised...
Inoue.
When did it start?
After the thing with my brother.
Oh... I'm really thankful for what happened then for you guiding my brother.
I'm sure he's happy on the other side.
Somehow I get that feeling.
That so?
Yes.
I wonder if Kuchiki-san's doing well there too.
She must have friends and family too.
I have got to bring her back.
isn't that... she is in a situation where she could be killed at any time.
I bet I know what you will say next... family or whatnot... she can see them again someday.
it's all over.
Kurosaki-kun?
She definitely... was here... right here.
Inoue.
Sado-kun...
That sucks.
our Onii-chan's already out somewhere.
that's enough of your-
Alright!
Then shall we sleep together in Dad's bed?
Bite me!
Sleeptalk AFTER you go to sleep!
I know I will have nightmares.
Well I did'n fink it 'as such a 'ad idea...

Is she still pissed off?
I haven't pissed anywhere.

Am I... really going to die?
Of course.

I see...
You are probably right... don't be stupid.
Obviously I'm joking.
Joking!
you fool?
Who's the fool?
You're the one acting weird and getting me to worry.
Captain Kuchiki's probably applying for a sentence reduction for you right this minute.
I wonder about that...
What are you?
Stupid?
He's your brother...
There is no way he would let his little sister die right before his eyes.
No...
He will kill me.
I know well what kind of person he is.
In the forty-or-so years since I was taken in by the house of Kuchiki that man... has not cared about me even once.

Whooooooooooaaa!
What the hell is this?
!
Who would have thought there was such a huge space under the stoooore?
!
Just shut up.
You don't have to shout for me.
I'm surprised enough anyway.
Okie-dokie then.
Let's get on with it already this study-group or whatever.
as you wish.
Dammit!
Why did you do that all of the sudden?
!
isn't it?
are destroyed. you're a normal human soul with no spirit power.
We can't even begin until the spirit power you have lost is restored.
Then what do I have to do?
I guess we will just go ahead.
Hey!
You ready?
I'm looking forward to working with you.
Lesson One:
if you would.
The rules are simple... you have cleared lesson one.
knock her out.
Don't be ridiculous!
Your telling me to hit such a little kid?
!
I think it will actually be quite difficult.
Please be sure to put those on.
Or else you could die.
Ridiculous...
I couldn't!
I told you.
huh...
Did he die?
I wonder.
there he is.
he's headed right at her.
he passed her by!
This is fucked up!
The hell was that?
!
it would mean instant death!
Hey!
How do I put this on?
!
Kurosaki-san!
Forehead!
Your forehead!
Like this?
Then you scream as loud as you can... the Power of Righteousness!
The Justice Headband!
Equip!
okay...
I got it.
Alright...
As if I could say that!
See?
Not the time to worry about embarassment.
the Power of Righteousness!
The Justice Headband!
Equip!
he actually said it...
You bastard...
Behind!
Behind!
O-Oh crap!
bring it! This shit is useless! I will get smacked around!
Wait... that means I can match her speed.
In that case...
Come on!
It works.
I won't aim for the face.
I will just hit her headgear a little.
so...
No matter what...
Shit!
Her face...
Safe.
please.
Congrats.
clear.
Why?
!
I lost to her!
Oh?
I didn't say you clear only if you knock out Ururu.
But... this girl has anti-Shinigami level fighting ability.
it could never beat her.
is it still hard to breathe?
Huh?
Now that you mention it... that means you have succeded in restoring your spirit power.
The point of this lesson was a single attack whether or not you could dodge the first attack.
Spirit power increases most easily when the soul is in danger of termination.
you would dodge the punch and banzai.
And if it didn't?
You would die.
tell me that ahead of time!
I believed you definately could dodge it. what do you say... we celebrate your passing?
Let's just go on to lesson two.
Lesson?
Are you willing to take it?
But...
This is so sudden...
More like the real issue is... a cat is is what?
Ichigo has begun preparations to go to Soul Society.
If you two also want to make use of the power you have awakened then you must take my lessons.
And whether or not you go there can come later.
I will go.
Sado-kun...
I... well...
I won't force you.
there he is.
Ishida-kun!
Yoohoo!
Inoue-san!
Sado-kun!
How did you find this place?
We had Yoruichi-san follow the spirit aura from your house.
Yoruichi?
What are you doing?
Camping?
No...
He's training.
Who's there?
!
over here.
I'm Yoruichi.
A cat is...!
A cat is...!
What?
boy.
Ishida-kun.
It's no big deal.
Actually...
I think it's enough of a shock to give someone minor emotional trauma.
aren't they?
excuse me.
just why is it you're here?
Actually...
Kurosaki is going to Soul Society?
he's going to save Kuchiki-san.
Ishida-kun.
it has nothing to do with me.
Kuchiki-san's life is in danger you know!
I cannot forgive myself for losing to the Shinigami!
That is why I train.
I don't care about Kuchiki-san.
I see.
I guess you're working hard doing your own thing.
I'm going to carefully consider it again.
It's certainly true that something's changing in me... but I know I want to find out what it is.
Ishida-kun.
Inoue-san.
But I cannot let anyone see this training.
Sensei.
I'm dying...
Precisely! you can no longer return to your body.
You have only to die.
Quit talking like it's got nothing to do with you!
And one more thing the chain will begin to erode from where it was cut. you will become a Hollow and it's The End.
What?
! you must become a Shinigami. you will be able to regain Shinigami powers once again.
though.
Isn't it obvious?
Okay.
Then here we go.
GO!
Were you surprised by my feint?
dude...
It's rather deep...
I did my best.
Ow...
The hell is this?
!
Kin.
but until this lesson is over I have forbade the use of your arms.
Damn...
You bastard!
Kurosaki-san!
Please climb up here in that condition.
That is the current lesson.
It's name is "Shattered Shaft".
I can't do that!
It doesn't look like you have time to debate whether you can or can't. erosion takes seventy-two hours to complete.
That's three days. if you please.
we will have to put an end to you.
Ururu how soon do you think Kurosaki-san can return to a Shinigami?
I say five hours!
About twelve hours!
I will bet 1000 that he can't return!
Hold it right there!
Captain.

The hell are you looking at ?
!
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently...
until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate, life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
I shall go...
Boy, this hill is really steep.
Is it?
It doesn't bother me.
But if you say things like that...
Hang in there, Yuzu!
Don't give up!
Dad is on your side!
See?
Ignore him, Yuzu!
If you pay attention to guys like him, it will only encourage him.
How naïve.
Even if you ignore me, I'm automatically encouraged!
Run!
My deathblow:
Father's Slide!
Begone... to the ends of the earth!
Now's our chance.
Let's go.
Boy, it's only June, but it sure is hot today.
It was June 17 that day too, but what a difference.
Oh, someone else is here.
You're right.
I wonder if she's here to visit a grave too.
Huh?
But... she's waving.
Ichigo, do you know her?
No!
I don't know her!
Not at all!
If I say I don't know her, I don't!
There's something familiar about her...
I remember now!
She's a classmate from middle school!
It's all coming back to me!
Oh, boy!
I feel so nostalgic.
I think I want to talk to her all alone, right now!
And so, I'll go and have a talk with her.
You two go ahead and visit Mom's grave!
Ichigo!
What?
Karin, what do you mean by that?
Well, I think the time for you to let go of your brother is close at hand.
Huh?
What do you mean?
Karin, wait a minute!
Why the heck did you follow me here?
Idiot!
What if a Hollow appears when I'm not around?
I mean...
If you're gonna follow me, be more discreet!
Well, pardon me...
I didn't think of it.
What are you mad about?
I'm not really mad...
"Killed..."
That's what you said about your mother, right?
I didn't say that.
Who killed her?
I never said that.
Forget it.
You said you've been able to see spirits ever since you can remember, didn't you?
Then, answer one question.
The one who killed your mother...
Wasn't it a Hollow?
There is that possibility.
If your spiritual capabilities were such that you were able to see souls since you were so little, the Hollow that came after you may have killed your mother by mistake-!
I can't take this anymore!
You've got to be kidding.
As far as you're concerned, Hollows are responsible for everything.
There was never anything funny about it, but when you give that as a reason for it there isn't anything that's less funny!
Sorry to disappoint you, but you're way off base.
It wasn't a Hollow or anything.
The one who killed my mom... was me.
Hey, Ichigo!
Huh?
When Ichigo was little?
Why do you ask, out of the blue?
Did something happen?
Yes, well actually...
I might have found out about his secret.
His secret?
Yeah.
Ichigo might really be a hero protecting the earth!
A h-hero, is he?
I think I was around four when I first met that hero.
He came to my dojo with hair an unbelievable color, holding the hand of an unbelievably beautiful mother, and with this unbelievably goofy grin on his face.
He was skinny and wimpy and looked so weak.
He really was a weakling...
Speaking of which,
I was the first one to make him cry.
I just poked him once, as a joke.
It didn't even take ten seconds.
But even if he had been crying, as soon as he saw his mother who came to pick him up he'd immediately break out into a smile.
I hated that about him.
A boy shouldn't be so happy when he's lost.
That's what I thought, looking at his smiling face.
He was such a wimpy mama's boy... but he seemed really happy like he was having a great time.
And then... when we were nine... his mother passed away.
Yeah...
We were still nine.
He was still a wimp always clinging to his mother... but she died...
He didn't come to school from that day...
I wondered what he was doing, so I went looking for him and
I found him on the riverbank where his mother had died.
He was there with his book bag on his back.
When he got tired, he'd crouch down, but then he'd stand up again.
Day after day, he seemed to be searching for his mother, all day long.
I couldn't bear to see him like that...
Ichigo, back then.
Tatsuki...
"I killed my mom?"
The one who killed your mother...
Wasn't it a Hollow?
What an idiot I am...
Hey, Rukia!
What is it, Kon?
Didn't I tell you not to come out until I called you?
But, Rukia, it's pretty hot in here.
I can't take it.
Can't we go home yet?
Didn't I tell you?
We've got to stay near him, or we'll be too late if a Hollow makes an appearance.
That's all you think about, Hollow, Hollow, Hollow!
Listen, if your job is all you think about, you're going to lose all your friends!
Oh...
Awk!
L-I'm sorry.
Are you mad?
What is it?
Hm...
I sure slept well...
Huh?
Good morning!
You!
I get nothing but these trying missions, you see.
I can't keep them up unless I get plenty of sleep.
S-Soul Reaper?
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Mission... you said?
See ya!
Yeah.
See you tomorrow!
Oh!
Oh my...
What a mean truck driver.
Are you all right?
I'm sorry.
Let's switch places.
I'll walk on the road side.
It's okay.
I'm wearing a raincoat, so I'm all right.
I'll protect you from stuff like what just happened.
My, how reliable...
But no...
I can't let you take the road side so long as you can't beat Tatsuki!
I won a point from her last time.
There, you're all cleaned up.
Hm...
Let's go!
Huh?
Mom, can I hold your hand?
Of course.
I would always feel at ease... whenever my mother was nearby.
Huh?
What's that girl doing?
Back then, I still couldn't tell the difference between humans who were living and those who were dead.
- Wait a minute, Mom!
- Ichigo...
No, Ichigo!
When I was really little, my dad told me they gave me the name "Ichigo"
which contains the meaning "to completely protect one thing you set your mind on. "
When I heard that, I decided to protect my mother.
I decided that, but...
I don't know what caused it... but it was clear that it happened as she tried to save me.
I just loved my mom.
Not only me... so did Yuzu and Karin, who were only four.
And Dad loved Mom, too.
Our whole family revolved around her.
And she was snatched away... from that center... by me.
Kurosaki Family Tomb It's been a while, Mom...
Have you been well?
Well, if you're dead, there's no being well or not, I guess.
We're all doing great - me, Yuzu, and Ichigo, too.
Quit crying, already, Yuzu.
You do this every year.
We're 11 already this year, we're grownups.
I know...
I know that, but...
You don't know anything...
Now, now, now!
Cheer up!
It's time now for our annual "Kurosaki Family Headstone Dominoes Tournament"!
A full two-and-a-half hours of tombstone toppling-
Why don't you go and start your life over from scratch?
!
There'll be some "wardrobe malfunctions," too...
To be honest, that shaggy guy has so much energy it's annoying.
There'll even be some peeks!
Go away!
Wait!
Just who are you?
Answer the question.
It's been a while...
The name Rukia Kuchiki was famous back at the Soul Reaper Academy.
Adopted into the noble Kuchiki family... you were known as the 'Princess from the Rukon District.'
Oh, and I'm Eikichiro Saidoh.
I was two years ahead of you.
You remember me, don't you?
Come on!
I was pretty popular too.
People used to call me "that funny guy."
See?
!
I don't remember you.
R-Really?
Oh, well.
Anyway...
I have a few questions for you.
You can't hide it forever...
Are you from Stealth Force?
Ding!
Ding!
Ding!
Ding!
Ta-dah...
You are correct!
Quit fooling around!
What is it you want?
!
Ichigo!
Where are you?
!
Rukia is...
Huh?
!
Rukia is!
Here we go...
You!
Ichigo!
They're getting pretty irritated over there...
They wonder why you haven't come back.
Hollows appear.
Orders come in too.
That's why I haven't gone back.
That's all there is to it.
Then why are you dressed like that?
Dressed?
What does it matter, how I dress?
!
Oh, well, I guess you're finally coming of age.
What are you talking about?
Don't hide it.
Don't hide it.
It's him, isn't it?
The guy who's mother is said to have been killed by a Hollow.
The guy with the spiked hair!
What are you?
Is it pity?
Or, are you looking for pleasure in the human world?
It's none of your business!
Shall I sew that mouth of yours shut?
!
Don't be so embarrassed.
It's best to be straightforward.
But... doing it with a human boy...
Guess you can't say it-!
No good, huh?
Too bad.
I thought that would be a good excuse.
If I don't get an answer the superiors will be happy with,
I'll have to take you back, even if I have to drag you.
Is that a threat?
Well...
I have no intention of returning for a while.
Now you've done it...
I have no choice.
Rukia!
Rukia!
Hey!
Who are you?
!
Yo, Spiky!
You can see me?
Kon, who is this guy?
How should I know?
What?
!
You're the one who said it was an emergency!
Hey, Spiky...
What about you?
Who are you?
I'm...
Ichigo!
Don't!
I'm a Surrogate Soul Reaper!
Soul Reaper?
No way...
What a stupid joke.
That's too funny.
Really, Rukia Kuchiki...
This is a serious crime.
A serious crime?
What's he talking about?
Oh, well.
It's no fun fighting a dumb Gigai, but anyway...
Let's do this, Spiky!
W-What?
!
D-Damn it!
Huh?
!
Ughh...
It's the end!
Huh?
!
Ugh...
Stupid Ichigo...
Interesting.
You transformed, and you're a human.
How did you get that ability?
As if I'd tell you after attacking me out of the blue!
Ichigo!
Back away!
This is my...
You don't have your sword.
What can you do?
Out of the way, Kon!
What's wrong?
Karin?
There you are!
What's the matter?
Where's Dad?
He said he was going to have a talk with the priest.
That good for nothing...!
I'm going to have you keep me company for a while.
The bigger the bait, the better...
Karin?
Heh-heh-heh!
Yuzu!
Run!
He's strong...
What's with you, anyway?
Is brute strength all you've got?
You have no idea how to fight.
Shut up!
What is it?
!
It's a Hollow!
A Hollow?
!
Where is it?
!
Close... and...
Look at this!
This spiritual energy...
It's quite a big one!
Hmm...
Seems pretty strong...
Aargh!
What?
You want to fight again?
!
Ichigo, now's not the time!
Your family might be in danger again!
Let's go!
H-Hey!
Oh, no!
Karin!
No!
Don't come near!
Karin!
Karin!
What's going on?
!
Yuzu!
What's happening?
Yuzu...
What did he mean by "serious crime"?
Don't worry about my problems now!
We've got to save your family first!
Aren't you going to ask me anything about my mother?
If I do, will you answer me?
It's your problem... a deep... deep problem.
I have no way of asking you about it.
No good way of asking you without tracking mud into your heart.
That's why I'll wait.
When you're ready to talk, tell me about it...
I'll wait until then.
Oh dear, this is a problem.
What should I do?
Yuzu...
You're so noisy.
One hostage is good enough.
Though the voyage must continue on
May seas always be calm
When the cycle of the moon is renewed may it shine
It's light to guide your boat
I offer this voyage a prayer
With each new day that still awaits
On vividly shining seas
To the end of the journey
I decided... to protect...
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently...
Until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate, life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
W-What is this?
!
It's huge!
I'll shoot you guys into the Seireitei with this.
From the sky.
- Sky?
!
- Sky?
!
My name is Kukaku Shiba.
I'm the best pyrotechnic in Rukon District!
Pyrotechnic?
Right!
Koganehiko!
Shiroganehiko!
Raise it!
Y
-Y-Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Huh?
!
What is that?

What's happening?
The floor...
Is rising!

Are you kids scared?
This is the special Kukaku Shiba Super sized Fireworks Stage.
The Flower Crane Cannon!
Don't say it before I do!
I-I'm sorry...
What, speechless?
What kind of joke is this?
!
You may be a fireworks expert or whatever, but as if you could shoot us over with that!
What is this?
The Reishu kaku, Spirit Core.
Place your palms on it and focus your spiritual energy!
Huh?
Like this?
How do you focus your spiritual energy?
Huh?
What are you saying?
Like this!
If you're a Soul Reaper, surely you know how to use your Kido.
Actually...
Huh?
!
This boy is the newbie Soul Reaper I told you about earlier.
He can't use Kido at all.
What?
!
Like this?
Geez!
How hopeless!
Ganju, show him!
Yes!
Hey, give it here!
Why you!
Kid!
Wanna fight?
!
Yeah...
Take it if you can.
I'd rather die than be shown by you!
Cut it out!
- Sorry...
- Sorry...
Huh?
W-What's that?
!
This is the Cannonball.
Cannonball?
Now listen up.
You think that the only thing guarding the Seireitei is that barrier, but you're wrong.
That barrier is made from an ore known as Sekki-Seki that is rare even in Soul Society.
This is a fragment of it.
As you can see, it completely breaks down spiritual energy.
That's why it's impossible to bore a hole through the barrier with spiritual energy.
On top of that...
Even when cut, it emits a wave that breaks down spiritual energy from all sides.
Which means...that the Seireitai has a spherical barrier around it from the sky to the underground.
And so...that's where this comes in!
S-Sis...
I'm tired
Deal with it!
This is the Special Hard Spiritual Partition Penetration Device that I invented.
In other words, if all of you combined put your spiritual energy into this Spirit Core, you can create a temporary cannonball that will break through the barrier.
And then...
I'll shoot that cannonball with the Flower Crane Cannon and it'll pierce straight through the barrier.
Any questions?
Err...well...
All right, you are dismissed!
Go to the underground training room and practice concentrating your spiritual energy!
- Yes, yes!
- Yes, yes!
Take them!
- Yes!
- Yes!
- Let me go!
- What the hell?
!
-Don't touch me!
Leggo!
-Put me down!
Listen, if any one of you loses concentration, you'll blow up right there!
What?
!
You all need practice!
Practice hard!
Hey, you never mentioned that!
Hey, good job.
S-SSis...
Go down below and help them practice.
Hey, Sis...
Are you really gonna help them?
What do you mean?
I'm against it!
Helping a Soul Reaper!
What'll I say to Brother?
!
Sis, I...
Ganju!
I told you...
Don't ever speak of it again!
Sis...
If you understand, go!
Listen...
Never show such a weak face in front of them!
This is the first time
I've had to wear the Lieutenant badge.
Of course it is!
It's the first time I've been ordered to wear it like this!
"Lieutenants are to put on their badges and wait in the aid's room #2."
This is getting interesting.
Abarai...
Iba...
Hinamori.
No one else showed up yet?
Yes, I think so.
Lieutenants are scattered all over Soul Society working diligently.
It might take about half a day for everyone to gather.
My Captain can't be reached at all.
What a pain.
Huh?
Who is your squad captain again?
You know, the Hitsugaya boy.
Oh, that little prodigy.
That's tough.
Abarai...
Huh?
Have you seen our Captain Aizen?
N-No, I haven't.
He's been acting strange lately.
Even this morning.
But he won't answer when I ask him if anything's wrong.
I don't know what to do.
Don't worry.
Huh?
Nothing's the matter.
Even this summons will probably be cancelled soon.
Dammit!
In your view, should she die?
What is it?
Just what the hell is going on, Captain Aizen?
!
Training Room No!
That's wrong, Ichigo!
It's not "wohhh."
- It's nuahh!
- Nuohh!
No, no!
Nuahh!
Nuohh!
No!
Kurosaki...
It's nuahhh?
Nuahhh.
Nuahhh!
I don't understand!
Explain it better!
Sorry, Brother.
I've decided to help that Soul Reaper, like the one who killed you.
If you were alive, and saw me not helping them, you'd scold me, wouldn't you?
You...who loved Soul Reapers and died as a Soul Reaper.
Now, please Orihime.
Oh!
You're doing just fine!
Ishida!
It's quite narrow, but the shape is there.
Hmm...
The shape probably reflects his personality.
Next!
Chad!
Oh, this is...a bit unstable, but very powerful!
And finally, Ichigo.
- This is terrible!
- Absolutely terrible!
- What is that...
- ...supposed to be?
!
I can only conclude that you have no talent.
- No talent at all!
- No talent at all!
Shirogane!
I said I don't understand!
You!
Teach me some useful pointers, damn it!
Uh, Brother...dinner's ready.
Huh?
Hey guys!
Dinner is ready!
You must be hungry.
Now that you mention it...
You didn't get to eat in Rukon District, did you?
Those guys can't use spiritual energy.
So they don't get hungry.
Go and eat.
But...
Never mind me.
Go and eat.
I'll come, after I figure this out.
Really?
Okay then...
Yeah.
Inoue, you're coming, too right?
Oh, I'm not hungry at all yet, so it's okay.
Heh...
I'm lying.
I am a bit hungry...
Oh, how embarrassing.
Inoue.
Go.
I'll be fine.
N-No...
I want to practice some more.
I'm really not hungry.
Inoue!
Please...
All right.
Okay...
Since you're asking me.
I'm going then.
H-Hey Inoue!
C'mon, Ishida.
Chad, too!
Dammit!
Is she that important to you?
Huh?
This Soul Reaper you're going to save.
Not really.
Huh?
Give it here!
Then did you, like, promise to save her?
No.
Then it must be money.
She promised to pay you if you saved her.
No way I can use money from here in my world!
Then why?
Why are you so determined?
!
I owe her!
She saved my life.
And I haven't repaid her yet.
She gave me her power to save my family and me...
Even though she had just met me.
Because of that, she was arrested... and she's about to be executed.
I don't want to turn into a pathetic guy who'd turn his back on her.
What?
- Give it to me!
- Huh?
!
What're you doing?
!
Give it back!
I'm going to practice, too!
Cover your ears!
Don't you dare listen!
I'm going to review the trick I developed myself.
Huh?
Visualize this...
Draw a circle in your heart... as dark as possible, and as heavy as possible.
Then... imagine yourself jumping right into the center of the circle.
This is the basic image that works for all Kido.
So easy.
It's so easy I could cry!
I didn't even have to practice it!
Sorry to bother you.
What a ham!
Such terrible acting!
Idiot!
Draw a circle...
In my heart...
Thank you for the meal.
Yes.
Huh?
Inoue, are you done?
Y-Yes, I'm full
See?
My stomach is full.
Y-You don't have to go that far.
Forget I ever asked.
Actually...
I was going to take it to Ichigo.
That's right, Kurosaki still hasn't...
Oh!
It's breaking apart!
No!
The object!
The Great Kukaku arm pillar is going to fall!
It's Kurosaki...!
Let's go!
What happened?
!
Hey Ganju!
I-I'm sorry, Sis...
I just showed him once.
I never imagined it would turn out like this!
You fool!
Gather your spiritual energy together already!
I did it!
You did it, Ichigo!
Yeah!
You idiot!
Don't lose your concentration!
Huh?
Weren't you listening to me, fool?
!
I told you!
If you lose concentration, you'll blow up!
Yes, you did.
I'll say, you...
You're just as guilty, idiot!
Both of you, no food tonight!
Why?
!
Why put me together with him?
!
Shut up!
Got a problem?
!
- Owee!
Okay, we understand.
- Okay, we understand!
You're here.
Captain of the Squad 3...
Gin Ichimaru.
What's going on?
I get called so suddenly...
And look at this crowd?
The captains who control Soul Society...
Are all here for me?
Maybe not.
The Captain of the Squad 13 isn't here.
Did something happen to him?
He's absent with an illness.
Again?
I hope he gets better soon.
Quit joking around.
You know you weren't summoned here for that.
I understand you went and played with the Ryokas by yourself.
And I hear you failed.
Explain yourself.
You should have no trouble dealing with four or five Ryokas.
Oh, they didn't die then?
What?
Oh, I thought they were dead.
My intuition has gotten dull.
You can stop that monkey business.
There's no way that captain level guys like us would fail to tell instantly whether an opponent's Hakudo has ceased or not.
There they go again, stupid squabbling among old fools.
Come on!
You make it sound like I let him go on purpose.
That's precisely what I'm saying.
Shut up, Kurotsuchi.
I'm talking to him now.
Or do you want to be done in by me?
What did you say?
So stupid.
Oh boy...
Tempers are running high.
Enough of this!
But I think the reason why you have been summoned has been made clear.
Acting alone, and letting the target escape...
Well?
How do you defend your actions...
Ichimaru?
I can't.
What?
!
There's nothing I can say to defend myself.
I made a simple mistake.
I won't make excuses.
I'll accept whatever punishment
Just a minute, Ichimaru.
First, let me ask you something.
Urgent alert!
Urgent alert!
Intruders in Seireitei!
All Squads get into position!
Repeat...!
Intruders?
Those Ryokas?
It can't be...
Ichigo...
With much appreciation send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
I'll always be grateful for who you are.
I was casually walking through town
Around the time dusk fell and the city was bathed in red
It was an afternoon with crowds of people coming and going
I don't know why but I just stood there and watched
Then my cell phone started to vibrate and I made myself move hoping it could fill in this hole in my heart
You're not alone You see, everybody
We gotta hold each other up
With much appreciation
I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
I'll always be grateful for who you are.
Four students and one cat into Seireitei!
Got it!
I'm off, Sis!
Attention, please!
The Cannonball will be shot very soon.
Guests, take your seats now or else!
I'm really worried.

It is almost time...
This looks like the place...
Zaraki?
Yeah.
Looks like you and me are all that's left.
Guess that's just how it goes.
We don't know for sure if the others have been defeated or not.
What the hell are you laughing at?
We obliterated most of your invading army.
And we're going to crush what's left of your plans right here.
Inaba Kagerouza...
Who the hell are you?
!
Looks like he doesn't wanna answer.
it's not like I care.
There's only one thing I wanna know.
or not?
How tragic.
To think that the two of you still do not comprehend that you have no chance of victory whatsoever.
Any luck?
I still can't get a reading on Kurosaki-san at all.
Are you saying he's dead?
!
it's too early to draw conclusions... guys!
There's no way that dumbass Ichigo bit the dust!
I just know he's gonna show up when right when we least expect him!
Right?
Kon.
Your tough act's pretty obvious.
You're really the most worried one here.
Shut up!
and I'm definitely not acting!
but it was in the Severed World that his communications were suddenly cut off...
What powers does Kagerouza have?
The fact is that we know next to nothing about that man.
But that girl... knows quite a lot.
she might even think the way he does.
I look forward to demonstrating my true power to you all once I've reclaimed Nozomi.
What did Kagerouza mean by that?
What secrets could she be hiding?

Am I... still alive?

I'm in... the Severed World...
Crap...
I'm fading...
Who are you?

Now I see.
You were deliberately backpedaling in order to position yourself for that technique.
I remember.
You're the Severed World specialist.
and tried to seal your opponent inside.
So that's your Zanpakutou's power - it manipulates space.
and all you've got is some cheap trick?
That's boring as hell.
that technique won't work on us again!

Or are you mocking me?

In order to do this!
What?
!
How... that was...
That attack just now was definitely my own Gunchou Tsurara...
Space manipulation...
That is how you characterized my ability.
And you were correct.
But you committed a very grievous error.
The domain within my power is far beyond the tiny realm of the Severed World.
It would be fair to say that I control the entirety of space.
What?
!

It is capable of memorizing and reconstructing space.
I had it memorize that space anew.
I trust you were able to follow my explanation?
I don't get it.
Guess it's just a magic trick in the end.
then I have no more use for you!
You disgust me!
Get the fuck out of here!
Quit with the ballet steps!
That was...
Indeed.
Your own slash.
So you can even reconstruct a Zanpakutou's attack?
Is it to your liking?
The same again?
I have you!
My word.
I saw through it.
The way you control your Zanpakutou.
You rotate it counterclockwise to memorize space.
and rotate clockwise to reconstruct it.
If I block your counterclockwise memorization... you can't do anything!
You're mine!
I am not limited to one reconstruction of an object.
I can reconstruct it as many times as desired.
Kagerouza!
if it isn't Captain Soi Fon!
I did not expect you to breach that barrier.
I commend your decision to imprison me as your very first act.
But of course.
Dealing with you gave me free reign over the Execution Corps.
Quite the intricate scheme you've got going there.
Shihouin Yoruichi-dono.
So you're Inaba Kagerouza?
You show yourself at last.
and now I see the reason.
I had a hell of a time rescuing Soi Fon and the others without you realizing it.
I do apologize for the inconvenience.
But it is child's play for me to bring all of this under my control as well.
Hearing you claim you can do that cracks me up.
Are you implying that it is beyond my abilities?
Am I wrong?
Shihouin Yoruichi.
but it is underestimation that I positively loathe.
Then you should spend less time underestimating your enemies!
Even you two?
Kuchiki... you're alive?
You still struggle?

It does not need two.

That is all.
You have nowhere left to run.

What's so funny?
You believe that you have cornered me with so little military strength?
It is true that you most esteemed originals fought well against my invading army.
even more so than I expected.
Yet you are still far from being able to defeat me.
I've had enough of your foolishness!
What is it?
I've detected Kurosaki-san's reiatsu!

Where is he?
Abarai-san.
Right.
let's go!

Aren't you a bit late?
Your master's already...
That was quite the combination... but it is as I told you.
Quite some time ago...
Have you come to understand that you have no chances of winning?
What?

D-Damn you!
Could it be that you didn't notice that I swapped places with my impostor... quite some time ago?
(Insects chirping)
(Man) Oh, yeah.
Bloody hell.
I'm sweatin' here.
Roastin'.
Boilin'.
Bakin'.
Swelterin'.
It's like a sauna.
A furnace.
You could fry an egg on my stomach.
Ohh...
Ooh, now that is hot.
It's ridiculous.
Tremendous.
Fantastic.
Fan-dabby-dozy... ..tastic.
(Sighs)
(Groans)
Oi.
Give it some.
This brush is sick.
It's a good brush, what's the matter with you?
Don't blame the brush, it's the man.
It's you, it's your technique.
Put your back into it.
Mush!
Yes, sir!

- What's that?
- It's a boulder.
- What?
- A fuckin' boulder.
I've got the fuckin' bends.
How did that happen?
I don't fuckin' know.
Where's the mobile?
I almost got killed, Dee!
I was that close to gettin' killed.
Serious!
You nearly had a squashed husband.
Here, give your mate a call.
- What?
- Your mate, the one with the truck.
- Felipe?
- Yeah, if that's his name.
Don't worry about this, darlin'.
It's nothing.
Come here.
It has done a fair bit of damage, Gal.
- Cracked the tiles.
- I had noticed!
- When's that gettin' fixed?
- (Dee) Saturday, apparently.
Wouldn't bet on it.
They're takin' the boulder out Tuesday and retilin' on Saturday, I hope.
(Dee) Oh!
(Gal) Fuckin' hell!
- (Laughter)
- Fuckin' thing!
He should be in the circus.
He's a menace.
(Dee) You all right?
(Gal) Yeah, I'm all right.
Oi, Gal.
You gonna stay with the same colour water?
- What d'you mean?
- Water.
You sticking' with the plain?
You can have different colours.
- Fuck off!
- Straight up!
Aquamarine, deep blue, mid-blue, tangerine, lilac, pink, plum, anything you want.
- They've got a chart.
- Is that right?
- Check it out.
- Gal, he's at it.
I'm not!
What do you know?
- (Laughter)
- Just have the fuckin' plain.
I fully intend to!
Now, eat your sausage!
(Women laugh)
# Henry Mancini: "Lujon"
(Gal) People say, "Don't you miss it, Gal? "
'say, "What?
England?
"Nah, fuckin' place.
It's a dump.
"Don't make me laugh.
"Grey, grimy, sooty.
"What a shithole.
What a toilet."
"Every cunt with a long face, shuffling' about, moaning' or worried.
"No thanks, not for me."
They say, "What's it like, then?
Spain."
And I'll say, "It's hot.
"Hot.
"Oh, it's fuckin' hot."
"Too hot?"
"Not for me.
"I love it."
(Man) He ain't gonna hit fuck all with that blunderbuss.
- Better off with a spear.
- Shut up, Aitch.
Shh!
(Aitch) I'll give you 100 to 1.
(Laughs)
Hold up.
Little peach.
(Gal) It's only a tiddler.
That's his problem.
Prepare to meet your maker.
Cowboy gun?
Fucking right, it was a cowboy gun.
Clunk!
What?
I'm gonna have the calamari.
What you havin'?
I'm not sure yet.
You like mussels, have the mussels.
No, I'll have this chicken thing.
What chicken thing?
I didn't see that.
Oh, yeah.
No, I'm gonna have the calamari.
I'll have the calamari.
Shall we just order?
I'm starvin'.
I'm Lee Marvin.
Here they are.
- (Applause in background)
- Hello, babe.
Whatever it is, leave it outside.
That way, we can have a nice evening.
Jackie...you look beautiful.
Can you get me a brandy, Aitch?
Now, that's what I like to hear, brandy.
Bloody brandy.
I'll have one of them.
- You all right, Jackie?
- Aitch...
Tell him, then.
- Tell me what?
- (Dee) Jackie?
Are you definitely retired?
Yeah, why?
- Definitely?
- I'm definitely retired.
What's this about?
Gal, we had a phone call, just before we left the house.
- Yeah?
- It was from London.
He's definitely retired.
Wait a minute, love.
Now, let me get this straight.
You had a call.
The phone goes.
It's a job, right?
- Yeah.
- And they want me?
Yeah.
- No one else?
- No.
- They want me?
- Yeah.
All right.
You've asked me and I've said no.
That's it.
So...why are we still talking?
Jack?
It was Don Logan.
- Oh, Christ.
- Don Logan.
Gal, I'm sorry, I didn't know...
- It's all right.
- Why didn't he just call us?
Who knows what goes on in that cunt's head?
- It's not your fault.
- Shouldn't have picked it up.
All right, right, um...
You tell Don...
Umm...
Tell him...thanks.
Thanks for thinkin' of me, but I've gotta decline.
- No offence, but...
- You can't.
Well, then, tell him...
Tell him...
- I'd be no good.
- They're serious.
Tell him what the fuck you like, anything!
- You can tell him yourself.
- What?
- Yeah.
- He's comin' over.
Tomorrow.
Wants us to pick him up.
OK.
Senor.
He rates you, Gal.
Reckons there's no risk.
Oh, that's nice, that.
Nice and cold.
I love this restaurant.
(Gal) Deedee, my lovely wife...
Come Saturday I'll have me pool back, swim in it.
Always dreamed of that...this.
Guess where?
That's it.
You got it right in one.
Inside, that's where.
"No risk."
No fucking risk?
Nine years of my fucking life, no fucking risk?
What you havin'?
I'm havin' the calamari.
(Crickets chirping)
Look, what's the worst thing that could happen?
He's gonna come here, ask me, I'm gonna say no.
He's not gonna be happy, then he'll leave.
- That simple?
- Yeah.
Now, please, come to bed, I miss you.
We don't have to be here.
Now, that would be the wrong thing to do.
You know that.
That'd be like a red rag to a bull.
All I can do is tell him to his face that I'm not interested, that's all I can do.
And I'm not.
And I will tell him.
Come here, give us a hug.
He1ll hurt you.
No...
He won't.
He won't hurt me.
He can't.
You know he can.
(Gal breathes deeply)
Come on.
Let's get some kip.
(Men shouting in Spanish)
(Gal) Oi!
Here y'are, sort him out.
He'll have the balance on Saturday.
Listen, stay away from here for a bit.
I'm all right for the moment.
(Mutters) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(DJ speaking Spanish on radio)
Gotta change my shirt, it's sticking to me.
I'm sweatin' like a cunt.
(Aitch) How's your brother?
Malky?
He's all right, I suppose.
Dunno, you'd have to ask him.
- You patched things up?
- It's up to him, innit?
- How was the flight, Don?
- Was all right.
So this is a Spanish villa, is it?
Yeah, this is it.
The old hacienda.
Bit remote, innit?
Cut off.
No, it's perfect, Don.
It's just how we like it.
D'you wanna look round?
Yeah, I will in a minute, when I have a piss.
Right, girls, you fit?
Where you goin'?
Taking the ladies out to eat.
Leave you two to it.
- Ain't I invited?
- No, Don.
No, no - course you are!
Only I thought you'd want some time.
Talk about things.
No, I'm jokin'.
It's all right.
Here y'are, I'll get it.
That's all right, Don.
No need for that.
Aitch!
Behave.
I'm payin' for your meal.
Oh, that's, er, very kind of you.
- Very nice of you.
- Shut up.
(Chuckles)
(Cicadas chirping)
Yeah, this is all right, innit?
Not bad.
What's that?
- A swimming pool.
- It's a bath, innit?
- We had an accident.
- Accident?
Yeah, this boulder came rollin' down the hill, just missed me.
Smashed some tiles.
Look.
- You happy here?
- Yeah.
Very.
What did Jackie say?
- Just that something was happening.
- Which it is.
And?
- You were planning something.
- And you said?
I didn't say much, just listened.
She put a question to you.
- Yeah.
- Which was?
That you thought of me.
To which you said?
She probably told you.
Told me nothing.
- Look, Don...
- Look, Don?
- It's like this.
- Like what?
I'm... retired.
(Snorts) Are ya(?
)
Fraid so.
I haven't...not got lots of money.
I got enough.
I'd do anything not to offend you, but I can't take part.
I'm not really up to it.
- Not up to it?
- No, I'm not.
I see.
- I'd be useless.
- Useless.
- I would be.
- In what way?
In every fuckin' way.
Why are you swearing'?
I'm not swearing'.
I'm gonna tell you a little story.
I know a bloke who knows a bloke who knows a bloke.
Hello?
Now, you know this bloke.
- Do I?
- This is a bloke you know.
(Man) 's that Mr Logan?
- Who's this?
- Hello, Mr Logan.
- Hello.
- What you doin'?
- Watching telly.
- What you watchin?
Nuffin'.
Is that Stan?
Course it is, you cunt.
Stan Higgins.
Wants me to put a team together.
Eight men.
Strong.
Ain't afraid of graft.
It's gonna take all night.
Good boys, gotta be good boys.
Reliable.
Positive attitude.
That's very important.
Very important.
That's what we're looking for, Don.
Who's behind this, Stan?
Who do you think?
- Who do you think, Gal?
- I dunno.
Who?
- Who?
- Teddy.
Teddy?
Teddy Bass.
Mr Black Magic himself.
Teddy Bass.
Months ago, he gets invited to this party, massive place on the Bishops Avenue.
Wild party, orgy.
Orgy?
(Gasping and groaning)
Said it was fucking incredible.
Arses everywhere.
Doin' everything.
Wanking, spanking...
Fucking...
Cocaine, camcorders...
Like ancient Rome.
How are you feeling, Teddy?
Are you all right?
Having fun?
Yeah, it's a gas.
What you staring at?
Who's he fuckin' sitting next to?
Who's he fuckin' sitting next to?
(Woman) Teddy, this is Harry, chairman of Imperial Emblatt.
Only the fuckin' chairman of Imperial Emblatt.
Heard of that?
No.
That's cos they're one of those sniffy lot, don't need publicity.
The back of your head.
What did you say?
I'm staring at the back of your head.
Well, don't.
Stare at the back of your own fucking head.
Like Standard Gradings TMD, remember them?
Yeah, safety deposits, late 70's.
That's it.
Only these are bigger.
Much bigger.
Men or women?
Oh... definitely.
(Clicking and whirring)
(Stan) This chairman's not such a big prick.
He knows who Teddy Bass is.
What he is, what he's up to.
But does he care?
- Does he, fuck.
- Thank you for that, Harry.
I've been looking for somewhere safe for that.
It's been in the family for donkey's years, generations.
Why?
Cos the place is impregnable.
The most elaborate security system in Europe.
Well, thanks, Teddy.
Thank you for choosing us.
It's a modern fortress.
No, it's perfect for me.
I'm well impressed.
I feel very...safe.
Well, rest assured, Teddy, we're very safe.
Very comforting to know that, Harry.
Nice doing business with you.
See you around.
Tell you what, Stan.
That is fucking impressive, that place.
I'll say that, fucking futuristic.
(Higgins) Yeah?
Doable?
I don't see why not.
See, where there's a will, and there is a fucking will...
There's a way.
(Stan) And there is a fuckin' way.
There's always a fucking way.
It's Saturday but you're needed in London Friday.
It's a bit sudden, innit?
No, it's very far from sudden.
It's been five months, I've been in on it for two.
It's not sudden.
Preparation, preparation, preparation.
It's a piece of piss, a monkey could it, so I thought of you!
Cheers, Don.
You're at the Grosvenor, your name's Rowntree.
If they give you a pull, you're just here to see some friends.
Somebody'll call you, pick you up.
Probably Mike.
What's that mean?
- What?
- That stupid nodding you're doing.
Is this a fuck-off, Gal?
No, course not.
- Are you saying no?
- No.
- Is that what you're saying?
- Not exactly.
- What are you saying?
- I'm just saying...
Thanks and all that, thanks for thinking of me, but I've got to turn this opportunity down.
No, you've got to turn this opportunity yes.
- I'm not match fit.
- You seem all right to me.
- Not really.
- You look fine.
- Do the job.
- What?
- Do the job.
- No, Don.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
- I can't.
- Can.
- I can't.
- Don't do this.
- Do what?
- What am I doin'?
!
- This.
This?
This what?
- Come on, Don.
- There's a boy lookin' at us.
Go home, son.
Go on.
I don't need you today.
Go on, go home.
Go home!
Who was that?
A Spanish kid who helps around the house.
Nice kid.
'you wanna go into town for a drink?
I'll show you round?
If you like.
I'm not fussed.
You're on two per cent, maybe even three.
Depends on the usual bumflufferies.
It's not about money with us, is it?
It's the charge, the bolt, the buzz.
The sheer fuck-offness, right?
# Dance to the music like nobody does
# The first time I saw you I knew it was love
# Groover... #
She's all right, Jackie, isn't she?
Yeah, she's great.
Great laugh.
Big tits.
Yeah, she's a lovely girl.
# My heart is on fire the night is divine
# My only desire is making you mine...#
I've missed my plane, I'm staying tonight, that all right?
Course.
I fucked her.
It's none of my business.
I know, I'm just tellin' you.
Three years ago.
Oh, yeah?
- Dirty cow.
- Yeah.
Aitch knows fuck-all about it.
What's she doing with him, lanky hunk of piss, fucking pillock.
He loves her, Don.
I'm tempted to tell him.
She tried to stick her finger up my bum.
I almost hit the roof.
What d'you make of a woman who'd do that?
Listen, don't say nothin1, Gal, but I...
- I quite liked her.
- Did ya?
Mmm.
How is she, all right?
- What's that, Don?
- You heard.
No, I didn't, Don.
Sorry.
Yeah?
Well, I'm not repeating it.
How far's the sea?
Talk to me, Gal.
I'm here for you.
I'm a good listener.
What can I say?
I've said it all.
- I'm retired.
- Shut up!
Cunt.
You louse.
You got some fuckin' neck.
Retired?
Fuck off, you're revolting.
Your fuckin' suntan, you're like leather.
Like a leather man.
You could make a fuckin' suitcase.
You look like a fat crocodile, fat bastard.
You look like fuckin' Idi Amin.
State of you.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Who d'you think you are?
King of the castle?
Cock of the walk?
Oof!
You think this is the Wheel of Fortune?
You make your dough and fuck off?
Thanks, Don.
See you, Don.
Off to Spain, Don.
Fuck off, Don.
Lie in your pool laughing at me, d'you think I'll have that?
You think I'll have that, ya ponce?
All right, I'll make it easy.
God, you're fucking trying.
Are you gonna do the job?
It's not a difficult question.
Yes or no?
- Don...
- Say it.
No.
Yes.
Fuck off, wanker, you're doin' it.
You know what I've noticed, Gal?
What stands out?
You haven't asked about anybody.
Everyone asks after you, "How's Gal?
Heard from him?"
"No, not for a while." "Is he all right?"
Leaves me wondering, "Have I upset him?
"Must have, I'll ask him." Have I upset you?
- Course not.
- Meaning?
Well, you haven't.
You're British, not a fucking Spaniard.
Don't kid yourself... (Brakes screech)
What's that?
(Bleating)
It's a goat.
They're a fucking nuisance.
What's it lookin' at me for?
God, the steak was enormous!
Size of it.
Couldn't finish it.
And he were nice, weren't he?
The waiter.
Oh, yeah.
Very attentive.
He liked you, Deedee, didn't he, Dee?
- Liked you.
- He's got good taste.
(Aitch) Handsome, weren't he?
Bloody Adonis.
Wasn't expensive...
You sound nice on the phone, Jack.
Nice telephone voice.
Sound like you work in an office.
- You ever worked in an office?
- No.
No?
Nice telephone voice.
I've worked in an office.
I was 17.
Does that surprise you?
What, that you were 17?
You got very nice eyes, Deedee.
Never noticed them before.
They real?
I'll get us all a drink, eh?
I'll give you a hand.
- He's staying the night.
- Have you told him?
Have you told him?
!
- Yeah.
- And?
It's not that simple.
Did you know he fucked Jackie?
Yeah.
(Footsteps)
What the fuck was she playing at?
(Aitch) This is a fucking nightmare.
He's a fucking nightmare.
What happened?
What'd he say?
You told him?
He knows.
Shouldn't have told him that.
Shouldn't have said anything.
Where?
In the bar.
About Jackie.
Jackie the Paki.
What, Gal?
He's all right?
Still, giving too much of yourself away.
Fucking mouth.
Best keep schtum.
Schtum schtum, quick quick, schtum.
Big mouth, fucking big mouth Don, Don, Don.
You all right, mate?
Don't look it.
Someone taking the piss, are they?
Liberties?
What?
That cunt through there?
What's he said to you?
It's all right, mate.
You can tell me.
He said that?
Just like that?
No...
That lump of shit said that?
Expects you to take that?
What, does he think you're a cunt?
I'll sort him out for you, shall I?
It's not a problem.
Can't have that.
Get up, you cunt!
- Lazy bastard!
- Get out of our room!
Get out, Don.
Get out!
I'll be downstairs.
(Gal) Unh...unh...
I love you, Gal.
You're loveable.
Big, loveable bloke.
Loveable lump.
Loveable lummox.
Gal Dove, party boy.
Big oaf.
So how is she?
All right?
No, no, how is she?
Well, is she?
She looks it.
Climate obviously agrees with her.
Still game for a laugh?
Honestly, of all the birds you could've had and you picked her.
Gal Dove.
Gal fuckin' Dove.
Dove the Love.
Glamorous Gal.
Big Gal.
Gorgeous.
Used to have a great body.
Great physique.
Birds loved you, couldn't get enough, and you wind up with that.
Dirty Deedee.
I love her with all my heart.
(Don) You know Vicky Raisins, the pornographer?
He's an old man, but he still operates off the Old Kent Road.
Says Deedee1s still got a fan club.
They meet up every month.
The Wednesday Wank they call it.
They're in big demand nowadays, those films.
She's very popular.
Very popular.
You seen 'em?
(Gal) I've seen 'em.
(Don) What a stain on your life.
All the Persil in the world couldn't shift it.
She's disgusting.
Do it.
(Sighs) I'm retired.
- Do it.
- This is madness.
I've had enough "Crime and Punishment" bollocks.
I'm happy here.
I won't let you be happy!
Why should I?
!
Friday, the Grosvenor, you'll be there.
- I won't.
- You will.
I told Ted.
- No, I won't.
- You will!
You're Mr Rowntree!
- No.
- Yes, Rowntree!
Yes, Grosvenor!
- No.
- Friday!
- I won't...
- You will!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Don, let's stop kidding ourselves, eh?
We know the reason you're here and it's not just me.
What'd you say?
It's not just because of me.
What you talkin' about?
You didn't come here to... just because of me.
I find this astonishing.
You're amazing.
This is astounding'.
- (Snorts) Repeat.
- Let's be honest.
This is about Jackie.
I come over here... for professional reasons, nothing else.
On a professional mission.
I've gotta hand-pick a team.
I had you in mind for that team.
But your attitude appals me, not what you're saying, what you're not saying.
Insinuendoes.
You're demonstrating some whopping great ego, my friend.
That sort of big-headedness can be a right turn-off!
If you don't wanna do the job, fair enough, I can accept that!
Considering the outrageousness of what's going on in your head, whatever stinking thoughts you're having, we can go it alone!
Cos they're so disgusting!
Fuckin' hell!
Fuckin' hell!
I would like to leave, now, please.
Get me a taxi.
Sir, I'm afraid you can't smoke.
What?
What do you want?
Your cigarette, you have to put it out.
Cigarette?
What, this?
- No, I'm not gonna.
- You must.
- Why's that?
- If you don't, we can't take off.
Well, that's your problem, innit?
It's your move.
- I'm afraid...
- I won't put it out, just wait till I've finished it, simple as that.
Why don't you just put it out?
You want me to cut your hands off and use it as an ashtray?
You prepared to let me stub it out on your eyeball?
I'll put it out.
Agreeable?
No.
Here come the gay brigade, look.
I'll tell you what...
I'll get off the plane.
You happy with that?
I'm happy with that.
I'll smoke it outside.
Open the door!
I hope this crashes.
Open the fucking door!
(Door opens)
This is very serious, Mr Logan.
You're right, I've been here for five hours.
As you may know, all European...
Before you start, let me ask you something, please.
Have you ever been sexually assaulted?
Neither have I, until today.
- What?
- That's what I said.
I'm putting my bag up in the cupboard, next thing, I feel hands on me, someone's touched me, touched my front...my front bottom.
I've gone all cold.
I look round, he's standing there, that steward with a guilty look on his face.
I didn't know what to say.
I had to sit down, I was that perturbed.
Then his mate, the other one telling us what to do if we crash, he starts and all, starts lookin' at me all funny.
I don't know if they wanted me for a twos-up or something,
I don't know how they work it, but it scared me, I was shakin' like a leaf.
So without thinking, I lit a cigarette to calm my nerves.
I was trembling', I was very emotional.
That's when the rest happened.
It's very regrettable.
Now, I don't want to kick up a fuss, right?
Press charges, contact the British Embassy.
I'd rather not pursue those channels, it's not my style.
I wouldn't lose the man his job, man's got to eat.
I'm sure he1s not representative of all you Spanish people.
But have a word with him, let him know he's been rumbled.
It's the one with the ginger hair.
(Aitch) What d'you think he's saying?
"Gal told me to go fuck myself"?
(Dee) Gal, how long you gonna be?
I'm just combing my hair.
- He'd look a right cunt.
- He is.
That's not what I'm saying.
I'm saying he has to save face.
Protect himself.
His image, his ego.
No.
I'll tell you what's happening.
He's gone back and he's said...
"I've decided not to go with Gal,
"he's fat, looks terrible, Michelin man."
Fuck off, I'm beautiful.
(Aitch laughs)
No, mate, put yourself in his perspective, the way he sees things.
You're in the clear.
Trust me.
Think I'm stupid?
!
Think I'm a fucking cunt?
!
You think I'm gonna have that?
Do you think I'll have that?
My fucking ears were burnin' all the way in the fuckin' cab!
Fuckin' on fire!
- What happened?
- What happened?
What fuckin' happened?
I'll tell you what fuckin' happened, you tell me, Gal.
Gave me a fucking knock-back, you fat fuckin' cunt.
- Problem with the plane?
- What?
What did you fuckin' say, cunt?
What?
Problem?
Fucking problem?
No, mate, no.
No problem with the plane, cunt, fucking plane was perfect, you're the problem.
You fucking Dr White honkin1 jam-rag fucking spunk-bubble!
You keep lookin' at me, I1ll put you in the fucking ground!
Dee, take Jackie and Aitch inside.
Yeah.
- Drink?
- Yeah, you scheming cunt!
See if the ladies let you try on their panties!
- You fuckin'...
- Don...
Shut up!
Shut up.
Not this time, Gal.
Not this time.
Not this fucking time.
No!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
No!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
No!
Not this fucking time.
No fucking way, no fucking way!
You made me look a right cunt!
Like a right fucking Mr Confused!
What's Jackie gonna think?
Not that I care, that's you fucking me about.
Is your middle name "Ungrateful"?
You just gonna stand there like Porky Pig?
Hiding behind your wife's skirt?
Your ex-porn star wife's skirt!
I don't give two fucks what Jackie Big-Tits thinks,
I've got enough fucking information on her.
So what if she's got a pretty face, that could all change!
Age changes that!
See if she's still coming with a face like a prune!
Aitch will be well gone by then!
I'm gonna kill you, Gal.
I'm gonna fucking kill him.
(Screams)
(Gal groaning)
You point a gun at me?
(Chuckles) Point a gun at me?
Gonna shoot me, are you?
Gonna shoot me.
Go on, then, shoot me.
It's all right.
Shoot me.
I'll have that.
There you go.
(Thunder crashes)
Cheers.
Good luck.
(Phone)
(Don) You're at the Grosvenor.
Your name's Rowntree, like Smarties.
If they give you a pull, you're just here to see some friends.
Somebody'll call you, pick you up.
Probably Mike.
Gal, got a minute?
Stan.
Hello, Ted.
How did he seem, Gal?
How did he come across?
- Who?
- Don.
Don?
He was all right.
He was Don.
Why?
Just...trying to trace back.
He was due back on Wednesday.
He stayed with me Wednesday, left...
Thursday.
- Yesterday?
- Yeah.
- That's what I mean.
- You take him to the airport?
- No.
- You didn't?
No, he got a cab.
Why?
You didn't see him get on the plane?
No, not personally, no, but I know he got on.
How?
- He called me from Heathrow.
- He called you?
- Yeah.
What's happened?
- Why'd he call?
I don't know, he said he'd landed safely.
I thought it was funny.
Sorry, about this, Gal, but Don's gone AWOL.
- Oh.
- You finished, Ted?
- Yeah.
- You can go back.
- We'll be through in a minute.
- Good to see you.
(All laughing)
I'm just taking it step by step, what else can I do?
Just one more day, darling, one more day.
That's all it is, just one more day.
Dee?
Dee?
I love you like a rose loves rainwater, like a leopard loves his partner in the jungle, like...
I don't know what like I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I know you know.
I know.
I know that.
I know you love me because I feel strong.
I have to go, I've got to get back.
I'm gonna hang up now.
I just want you to do one thing for me.
Just one.
Just say my name for me.
Just once.
Gal.
(Men laughing)
This phone call from Heathrow, tell me what he said again.
Who, Don?
I told you.
Tell me again.
- Just that he got back safe...
- No.
- He didn't do that.
- How d1you mean?
- I mean he didn't do that.
- Yeah, he did.
No, he didn't.
He didn't phone you from Heathrow.
I'm the one who got the call.
If you know different, tell me.
I don't know, Ted.
I don't know what you're getting at.
Don offered me a job, I said, "Yes, please", he goes.
Next thing, he phones me from Heathrow and says, "See you Friday night".
- That's how he left it.
- But he didn't phone from Heathrow.
All right, he didn't phone me from Heathrow, but he phoned me.
I'm not lying, Ted.
OK.
All right.
- Good luck tonight.
- Cheers.
I'm hurt!
See you around.
(Don) Where there's a will, and there is a fucking will... (Stan) There's a way.
And there is a fuckin' way.
(Ted) There's always a fuckin1 way.
How's it going, Gal?
We're in there, Stan, but it ain't getting any easier.
It's just so fucking awkward.
- What time is it?
- Ten to twelve.
- How long?
- Another three hours, Ted.
- Maybe four.
- Fuck that.
Two, two and half.
(Don groaning)
(Growling)
(Shouting incoherently)
Oh, my God!
Help me!
You've fucked hundreds!
Fucked hundreds!
Jackie...
I love you.
(Don) Help me, you cunt!
Get the fucking gun!
(Don) Fat, fat, cunt, cunt!
Murdering twat!
Bollock!
(Don mumbling incoherently)
I fucked Jackie.
Fucked her.
Ask her, she1ll tell you.
I fucked her.
Yeah, well...
I've fucked you now, haven1t I?
Right, Malky, get Gal out!
(All shouting)
Everyone all right?
(Hammering)
(Man) Wheel 'em out!
(Cheering)
(Laughing and shouting)
(Applause)
Gentlemen...
- You're all cunts.
- (Laughter)
You tired?
No, I'm all right, actually, Ted.
You're a fucking millionaire now, ain't ya?
- I was gonna say...
- Gal, no, no, you...
Go on...
What?
(Chuckling)
Congratulations, it went like a fucking dream.
Congratulations all round.
What's the matter?
You do not look happy.
Me?
No, I'm happy.
I1m well happy.
We're all happy, mate.
Yeah.
What's with the bag?
You, er...
You shooting' off?
Who, me?
No.
Well, yeah.
I've got a plane to catch.
- Have you?
- Mm.
I'll give you a lift.
- It's all right, Ted...
- Come on.
See you later, Stan.
I've just got to stop off for a minute.
Is that all right?
Yeah.
Course.
Come with me.
(Doorbell)
(Doorbell)
(Harry) Who is it?
It's Teddy.
What do you want?
It's ten past five.
I know, I'm sorry.
I need your help, something's happened.
What is it?
(Teddy) Come in, Gal.
What are you doing?
I need a drink for my friend.
Can you fix him one?
So, what are you having, Gal?
Um...
I'll have a whisky, please.
Cheers.
No, I'm all right.
Where's Don, Gal?
He never left Spain, I know that.
He never got on the plane.
Well, he did, and he got off again.
And there's no record of him getting another flight.
I can only assume...
he's still in Spain.
I'm not into this any more, Ted.
Spain, eh?
Yeah.
I must drop in sometime.
Pay my respects.
How much did he say you were on for this?
- He wasn't specific...
- I'm giving you a tenner.
I've only got twenties.
You got change?
You see... if I cared, Gal... if I fucking cared... if I gave a solitary fuck about Don...
Get out of the fucking car.
(Aitch) Look, with this pill, they say you take it and that's it.
Your hair don't grow, you don't go bald, it stays the same.
You have your hair cut once, in whatever style you want, and it stays like that for the rest of your natural life.
It's revolutionary.
(Jackie) What if you get fed up with your style, you berk?
Ahh...
Well, that1s where the antidote comes in.
- Oh!
- Smart-arse.
The whole process is reversible.
You just take a different pill.
Now, I'm not saying this is gonna happen next year but it will happen, it's definitely coming.
Hairdressers are shitting themselves.
(Jackie laughing) Shut up!
They did a test with three monkeys, right?
Gave 'em all a Beatles-style haircut.
They've been living with that cut for the past two years.
And apparently, they're very happy with it.
(Deedee) I can't listen to this!
You hungry, love?
Shall I fix you a sandwich?
Oh, yeah.
That'd be lovely.
(Don) Told you you1d do the job.
(Gal) Yeah, well...
you were right, Don.
Technically speaking, you were right.
But you're dead.
So shut up.
(Roars)

Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently...
until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaz e of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate, life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
Yuzu...
You're so noisy...
One hostage is good enough...
Karin!
Good.
I still have my hostage.
I've been waiting for you, Soul Reaper.
Karin!
Ichigo...
Furukawa Family Plot
That bastard!
What's going on?
Why you...!
You're the one who was at the riverbank, aren't you?
Six years ago!
So what are you doing here?
!
Six years ago?
Ichigo, don't tell me!
Yeah...
I tried to help her back then.
But when I realized it, she was gone... and my mom was...
My mom was...
Six years ago, huh?
I don't remember things so long ago.
I see...
This is very interesting.
Grand Fisher!
That's his code name.
He hides himself and gives the lure that grows out of his head a human appearance.
And when he finds those who are able to see it...
In other words, those who have high spiritual energy... he attacks them and increases his own power.
For over fifty years, this Hollow has defied Soul Reapers like us.
And his favorite is... women.
Which means... my mom was...
I see.
You survived even after seeing me.
What a lucky kid.
Perhaps at first I intended to devour you for your high spiritual energy.
However... women always seem more delicious.
Why that...!
Haven't seen a Hollow so disgusting in a long time.
Karin!
Don't be so careless, you idiot!
Ichigo!
You're one bastard I'll never forgive!
Disintegrate, you black dog of Rondanini!
Look upon yourself and burn!
Tear out your own throat!
Binding Spell 9:
Strike!
Do not interfere!
Now then, I'm going to devour this girl.
What will you do?
Karin!
Stop!
Then will you let me eat you instead?
Karin!
Hey!
You...
Why would you go that far?
Sou Reapers keep fighting Hollows no matter what happens.
Soul Reapers will never forgive Hollows.
When a Hollow attacks indiscriminately, and you lose something precious to you, only an empty feeling remains.
I can't let that happen!
You've gotta protect, Spiky...
you understand?
Hey!
No way...
He can't have died if he's a Soul Reaper!
Even Soul Reapers are not immortal.
Even if the form is different, death is...
This guy's asleep.
Hey, get up!
It's distracting!
Sis!
Whoa... this looks pretty bad.
Kon!
Take the sisters and run!
What about you?
- Hurry!
- Right!
Ichigo, back me up.
Ichigo!
Rukia, get back.
What?
Just stay back this time.
I'll do it myself.
Don't be ridiculous!
He is strong.
I told you, he's been defying Soul Reapers for over fifty years-!
Shut up!
Please...
Don't interfere.
This is... my fight!
Karin!
A-Are you all right?
Cripes!
Acting all serious with my eyebrows furrowed is tiring!
How does Ichigo keep such an expression for so long?
!
You're slow, kid!
It was gutsy of you to tell your friends not to interfere when that's the limit of your strength.
Huh, kid?
Shut up...
I don't really know how much Yuzu grieved after Mom died.
Or how lonely Karin felt.
You gotta protect, Spiky.
I decided to protect.
I'm going to...
destroy you!
Didn't your friend tell you not to be careless, kid?
Now how many times have you jumped right into the lion's den without any strategy?
That's why they call you careless, kid!
You're too rash.
Much too rash.
You push away your comrade in the heat of the moment, and jump right into your enemy's lair.
You'll just die while I toy with you.
- Ichigo!
- Stay back!
Stay back, Rukia!
I'm going to destroy him!
Even if my arms are ripped off...
even if my legs fly off.
I'll beat him!
And that's why I say you'll die.
Because you are young, you fly off the handle easily.
And that passion distracts your heart.
And a distracted heart dulls your sword.
It's over, kid!
You're much too young to be fighting me!
Ichigo!
That's...
Why you...!
Even the most cold-blooded Soul Reaper has one person whom he can never kill.
That is a certainty.
By learning who that person is,
I have been able to defy every Soul Reaper 'til now.
And for you, this person is the one.
Right...
Ichigo?
Ichigo!
And what of his honor?
If you lend him your strength now, his life will probably be saved.
But in doing so, you will forever destroy his honor.
Now listen and remember this.
There are two kinds of battles.
We must always distinguish between the two.
The battle to protect life...
and the battle to protect honor.
That's right.
This is a battle to protect his honor.
It is a battle in which I cannot lend him my strength.
Don't help him... don't help him...
don't help him!
Don't die, Ichigo!
Oh dear, I fell asleep.
Damn!
Can you draw your sword against this woman?
Why you...!
Do you realize what you're doing?
Don't you dare... bring my mom's image out to a place like this!
You must not, Ichigo.
Put down your sword.
Don't hurt your mother.
Please.
Didn't I tell you?
Anger will dull your sword.
It will be over with the next blow, kid.
But I'll say this much for you.
Among those I have encountered, you were the youngest, and the most rash... and the weakest Soul Reaper!
Ichigo!
W-Wha...?
!
That's...
Mom?
His mother's thoughts are manifesting themselves.
Does that mean the lure had recorded his mother's thoughts at the moment of her death?
Thoughts at the moment of her death?
I caught a glimpse of it earlier...
No telling how this battle is going to end yet.
Ichigo...
I'm so proud of you!
Dad, Karin, Yuzu, and you, Ichigo.
I'm so proud that I was able to meet you.
Live, Ichigo.
With strength, with kindness, and with a smile...
Thank you...
Ichigo.
Ichigo...
Mom...
Is that what you were thinking at that time...?
Anger dulls the sword...
That may be true.
However... you're wrong about one thing...
In order to beat a thing like you, a dull sword is more than enough!
If I were the rain... would I have been able to connect someone's heart like the rain which connects the never intersecting sky and earth?
Ichigo,
I think I've come to understand you a bit more.
Dammit!
Dammit!
I won't forgive you!
You're just a Soul Reaper!
Wait!
Ichigo!
Stop!
That's enough.
Neither of you can fight anymore.
The battle is over!
Not yet!
He's still not dead!
I still...
Ichigo!
You lived, Ichigo...
Thank you.
He's something else.
The power of the Soul Reaper's spiritual energy is the power of his life energy.
This kid could become a monster.
Time to go home.
I'm not so heartless as to break up a serious couple.
I guess, Rukia, you've come of age.
Don't even go there!
Well, whatever...
When they find out, they find out.
Bye-bye!
Sorry.
I couldn't get revenge.
Mom...
Well, if you show yourself looking fit and healthy like that,
Mom will be relieved on the other side.
Don't eavesdrop on your own son.
I thought you quit.
When we first started dating she complimented me.
She said that I looked cool holding a cigarette.
Thinking back, that was the first and last time your mom ever complimented me.
That's why I smoke just once, on this day every year in front of her.
How can you keep smiling?
Why doesn't anyone blame me?
It's hard to take!
It'd be much easier if you all blamed me for this!
Why?
!
Why should we blame you?
Huh?
If I blamed you for causing Masaki's death,
Masaki would scold me.
It's no one's fault that Masaki died.
She was...
just the woman I loved, who would give her life to protect her own child.
And remember this:
You are the man whom the woman I loved protected with her life.
Dad...
Oww...
Live well, Ichigo...
Live well, grow old well, go bald well, and then die after me.
And if you can, die laughing.
Otherwise, I won't be able to face Masaki.
Shake off your depression.
You're way too young to be burdened by something cool like sadness.
I'll be waiting below.
Are you listening, Rukia?
Let me be a Soul Reaper for a while longer.
I want to become strong.
I want to become strong and protect people from Hollows!
Those who are attacked by them.
And I'm going to beat him!
Otherwise...
I won't be able to face my mom!
Ichigo...
Though the voyage must continue on
May seas always be calm
When the cycle of the moon has renewed may it shine
It's light to guide your boat
I offer this voyage a prayer
With each new day that still awaits
On vividly shining seas
To the end of the journey
Wow!
What a scary Hollow that was!
I was pitiful in this episode, but next time, come hell or hight water,
I'll show my stuff, for Rukia's sake!
- There're no scenes for you next time.
- Huh?
!
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway

We Tremble in Awe of That Which Cannot Be Seen
And We Worship That Which Cannot Be Seen
Yes...
I sense a strong Spirit Energy...
What's this...?
You kick Yama down and now you tell us to get outta your way?
!
Uhh...
Say something, damn you...!
Oh, Toshirin's...
This is bad!
He's so unreasonable!
Shut up, will ya?
!
Listen, all of you...
Look at that!
First question:
What can that be?
You, in the middle!
Huh...?
Uh, well...flowers for the kid who died here the other day?
Absolutely right!
Mit chan!
Then tell me...
Why is that vase on its side?
Well...we were skateboarding and knocked... it...over...
If you ever do it again...
I'll make it so someone will have to offer flowers for your souls, too!
S-Sorry about that!
Whew.
If I put that much fear into them they probably won't be back.
I'll bring you some fresh flowers tomorrow.
Thank you for getting rid of them.
Now I should be able to rest in peace.
You're welcome.
It's about time you passed over.
I'm Ichigo Kurosaki, 15, a tenth grader.
My family runs a medical clinic.
We save some, and we lose some.
Maybe it's because of that, but ever since I can remember, I've been able to see ghosts.
I'm home...
You're late!
You delinquent!
You know that dinnertime here is always at 7:00!
You!
Is this any way to treat your son, who just laid his life on the line to help a ghost pass over?
!
Shut up!
I don't care what your excuse is.
Anyone who disturbs the peace and happiness in this home will be punished!
Or what?
Are you gloating over the fact that only you can touch or talk to ghosts?
!
Shut up!
I didn't ask to be born like this!
Stop it, will you two?
Dinner's getting cold.
Leave them alone, Yuzu.
More rice please.
But, Karin.
Anyway...
Ordering a healthy male high school student to come home every night at 7:00 is...
Ichigo, you have a new one on you.
Huh?
This guy...when did he get here?
!
No matter how hard I try to get rid of them, they just won't go away!
Thanks for dinner.
Poor Ichigo.
He's so popular.
But I sort of envy him.
I can sense their presence, but I rarely see anything.
Well, I don't believe in ghosts and such.
What?
But you see them too, don't you, Karin?
Dad's the only one who can't see them.
Whether I see them or not, if I don't believe in them, they don't exist.
Ohh...
So cold!
Dinner.
Wide open!
Never mind!
I'm going to bed.
Oh, Ichigo...
It's your fault, Dad.
Why?
!
Ichigo is having a tough time right now.
Now that you mention it, he said he's seeing more of them than before.
What?
!
You mean he talks to you about things like that?
He doesn't tell me.
Of course not.
You're over 40, but can only communicate in this immature way.
Who'd want to tell you anything?
Dear...
I don't know if it's because they're in puberty, but our daughters have been so cold towards me!
What should I do...?
First of all, get rid of that stupid memorial poster.
The incident occurred one block away from the main street outside of Karakura Station.
According to local residents, at about 7:30 AM, the ground shook with a loud crash and the walls of many buildings exploded.
Good morning, Ichigo.
Morning...
Where's Dad?
He has a meeting.
He won't be home tonight.
I see...
Huh?
Investigators and explosives experts are currently working to discover the cause.
What's wrong?
That's near here.
Hey!
Hm?
What was that sound?
I didn't hear anything...
It's another explosion!
W-What's that...?
Help me!
Run!
What is it?
!
I don't know!
Oh.
Hey!
Hurry!
Hey...
Hey, you?
What was that, anyway?
Another explosion?
What's going on?
I can't figure it out...
Who was that?
Who...are you...?
Who are you?
!
What do you want?
Hey!
It's near...
What are you talking about?
!
First you scare the living daylights out of me, then you ignore me?
I'm asking you who you are!
Y- iYou...
You can see me?
But wait.
You just kicked me...
Huh?
What are you babbling about?
Of course, I can see you.
You were the one in town earlier, weren't you?
You just noticed?
Strange...
People usually can't see me...
Quit talking nonsense...
Why, you...!
Then, I will tell you.
I am...a Soul Reaper.
Again...
Where...?
I see.
So you're a Soul Reaper.
And you've come all the way here from this Soul Society place in order to exorcise evil demons.
So that means that that monster was a demon.
And it attacked that girl.
Okay, I'll believe you...
Idiot!
You think I'd believe that?
!
You're...
You're saying that, although you see ghosts, you don't believe in Soul Reapers?
Of course!
Unfortunately, I've never seen a Soul Reaper before.
I don't believe in anything that I can't see.
But you're seeing me now.
I'll admit that you're no human.
But quit playing "Soul Reaper" around here.
Got that?
You pipsqueak.
You dare to call me that?
!
Bakudo Number One:
Sai!
Ouch!
What did you do to me?
!
You can't move, can you?
This is Kido, a high-level incantation that only a Soul Reaper can use.
I may not look it, but I have lived nearly ten times longer than you.
And you called me a "pipsqueak"?
!
In any other situation, I would kill you on the spot, but I am not permitted to execute anyone not named in my orders.
Be grateful for that, pipsqueak.
Of all the nerve...!
And so...
Oh...
Y-You're the guy from yesterday...
N-No.
I don't want to go to the Netherworld!
Fear not.
Your destination is not the Netherworld.
It is the Soul Society.
Unlike the Netherworld, it is a restful place.
What happened...to that guy?
I sent him to the Soul Society.
In your language it's called "passing over," I guess.
It's one of the jobs of Soul Reapers.
I will explain it simply so that even an impatient brat like you can be satisfied.
Now listen.
There are two types of spirits in this world.
The first are normal spirits called Wholes...
They're the ghosts you usually see.
The second are called Hollows.
They attack people, living or dead, to devour their souls.
They are evil spirits.
Do you have any questions so far?
Well...
Tell me why your drawing is so bad, why don't you?
Hey!
What the hell did you do?
!
I will continue my explanation, Baron.
Baron...?
We Soul Reapers have two jobs.
The first is to lead the Wholes to the Soul Society with a send off, Konso, as I just did.
And the second is to cut and purify the Hollows.
Why was that Hollow going after that girl?
That I do not know.
We have yet to grasp everything about them.
I smell it...
It's the smell of an especially tasty soul.
It's nearby...
along with the smell of a Soul Reaper.
Oh!
What was that?
!
Whatever the case, there's another one wandering around here.
Then, hurry up and get rid of it!
No, well.
For some reason, I haven't been able to sense its presence at all.
It's as though some strong force is obstructing my senses.
What are you saying?
!
Can't you hear the terrible cries?
!
Isn't that the Hollow you're after?
Terrible cries...?
I don't...
I heard that!
That is definitely the cry of a Hollow!
See?
!
Yuzu!
Hey, wait!
What strong spirit pressure!
How could I not have sensed this?
!
I...!
Ichi...go...
Yuzu!
Karin was.
Ichigo...
Please save...
Karin...
Hey, you!
Hey!
Damn it!
Stop it!
Stop... it!
Stay back!
Karin!
Damn it!
He's moving...
after I put that spell on him...!
You'll get in the way!
Stay back!
Shut up!
Karin!
Stop that!
No human strength can break it.
If you try to force it, your soul will...
A human breaking the spell under his own power?
Wait!
Ichigo...!
Run!
Karin!
I found you.
Karin!
Hey!
Get a hold of yourself!
That Hollow has not devoured your sister's soul yet.
Are you sure?
Yes...
It is seeking a soul with a higher concentration of spirit energy.
I see.
That Hollow this afternoon wasn't after that girl, either.
What do you mean?
For some reason, your spirit energy was almost completely suppressed until just now.
That's why I didn't sense anything about you, and you were never attacked by a Hollow.
It's just conjecture, but perhaps the spirit energy that was sealed up within your body... began to pour out due to the contact you had with the ghost of that young girl.
In other words, those two Hollows sensed the density of your soul through that girl.
They are really after you!
They're...after me...
It's here!
You stay...
Shut up!
Are you saying that girl was attacked because of me?
What are you talking about?
It's my fault that Karin and Yuzu's lives are in danger?
!
Please save...
Ichigo...
Run!
Hey!
You...!
You want my soul, don't you?
In that case, come fight me one on one!
Soul Reaper!
You fool!
You should have known...
That you were no match for him...!
Or, did you think that everything would be over if you gave him your soul?
At this rate, we will all simply become food for him.
Do you want...
To save your family?
Of course!
Is there a way?
There's just one way...
You must become a Soul Reaper!
What?
!
Run the point of this Zanpakuto through the center of your being and I will pour my powers into you.
I don't know if it will work, but there is nothing else we can do.
Give me that sword, Soul Reaper.
My name is not Soul Reaper.
I am Rukia Kuchiki.
I am...
Ichigo Kurosaki!
How could it be...?
I meant to give him half of my energy, but he took it all...
Hey!
Who is he?
!
I have never seen a human with spirit energy enough... to confuse a Soul Reaper.
I have never seen a human with strength enough to break a spell on his own...
And...
I've never seen a Soul Reaper's Zanpakuto... become so large!
Now you'll pay for hurting my family!
You fish face!
Though the voyage must continue on
May seas always be calm
When the cycle of the moon has renewed may it shine
It's light to guide your boat
I offer this voyage a prayer
With each new day that still awaits
On vividly shining seas
To the end of the journey
Hey, how are you all doing?
This is your idol Kon, who was voted
"the one you'd most want to make your bride" In the world of Bleach!
It's finally started...
The high school Soul Reaper's sweet but painful, slightly salty, heartfelt...
No!
You don't appear until later in the story!
Oh, we're out of time...
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently...
until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate, life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
W-What did you just say, Captain Kuchiki?
What is the meaning of this?
As you heard.
Don't make me repeat myself.
Rukia Kuchiki is guilty of a first-degree offense and will be executed in 25 days at the Central Execution Grounds.
That is the final decision of the Soul Society.
This will be the last time we exchange words.
Rukia, the next time I see you will be at the execution stand.
We shall not shed tears...
For tears mean the defeat of the body to the heart.
And to us, that simply proves that the existence of a heart is a burden.
Lesson Two!
Shattered Shaft!
At the bottom of the Shattered Shaft, you have 72 hours, or three days, before the chain is completely Encroached.
You must come back up here as a Soul Reaper before the time is up.
Otherwise, we'll have to kill... the Hollow that you become.
You bastard!
You intend to kill me?
!
Oh yes... when you give up.
Completely hopeless.
- Huh?
!
- Huh?
At this rate, I will never be able to let you enter the Soul Society.
Oh no...
Well, of course!
Unless you are able to activate your powers at will, you will die a dog's death in the Soul Society!
It's not that hard.
Just remember the first time you used it and retrace those steps.
It's easier said than done.
I was so desperate that time...
What were you so desperate about?
Huh?
A person takes a sword when he's trying to protect something.
Perhaps it's your life, social status, reputation...
loved ones, beliefs.
Though the motives might differ, there's no difference in the desire to protect something.
Think back.
What were you trying to protect back then?
I see...
I was... trying to protect Ichigo's kid sister?
A red cap... long hair...
And since she's Ichigo's sister...
She looks like Ichigo... a girl.
Huh?
!
It seems you failed at remembering.
And what about you?
I...
I was... at that time...
I was so desperate...
So desperate!
It shined!
Oh really?
E-Everyone!
Did you call?
When you need us, don't hesitate, just call.
In this situation...
why would you need us?
!
What are you doing?
I-I'm sorry.
I remembered all kinds of things and...
Owwee!
You weren't even in danger, yet you called us!
You terrible hussy!
Tsubaki... stop it!
It hurts when you kick!
Shut up!
I'm pissed off!
- You hussy!
- No!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
- Tsubaki, stop it!
- Please!
Oh dear...
He's uncontrollable!
- Tsubaki is so rough.
- No, stop!
Well done.
- Although, it seems you'll need...
- I said sorry!
- Practice on taming your power.
- Please!
Now then...
What about you?
Why are you going to the Soul Society?
That was the fifth Encroachment just ending...
It seems they repeat the cycle of several minutes of Encroachment and sleep.
During the Encroachment of the chain,
I can't move because it's so painful I could go blind.
So I have to act while they're asleep.
That kid makes no sense.
The method is reckless, but he's managing to climb about three meters of this virtually straight-up wall!
Oh, my my...
Idiot.
Dammit!
Hey!
Huh?
Aren't you getting hungry?
I'm not!
Besides, I'm in a soul form!
Why would I get hungry?
!
That's good!
I'll tell you something interesting.
When you get feeling hungry while in soul form... it's a dangerous sign, that you're just a step away from becoming a Hollow!
Huh?
!
It's okay to feel thirsty, though.
And if you do get thirsty, go ahead and drink my spit.
Why you...!
Here...
Ururu...
You too.
Okay!
Come on down!
Hey you!
Brats!
It's coming down!
Cut it out!
Stop!
I'll beat the crap outta you!
Stop!
Stop, please!
I wonder if it's dark outside...
It's hard to tell the time in this room.
Dammit!
I can't climb it...
How much time has passed?
I can't tell.
How can I climb outta this place?
!
I brought you some food.
I figured you'd start feeling hungry.
Hah!
What're you talking about?
!
As if I'd get hungry!
Take a good look...
There's still quite a few links to the Chain of Fate.
I guess it can't be helped if you can't tell time in a place like this.
Time?
70 hours have passed since you came down here.
Some quick ones start turning into Hollows already.
Also one more thing...
The final Encroachment is nothing like the others.
Huh?
!
A-All the chains!
Stop!
Stop!
All of you!
Sto...!
Hey hey!
He's going to become a Hollow, after all!
I'm going into rescue mode.
Hold it.
Kisuke...
Watch him carefully.
Usually, when a Plus becomes a Hollow... the spiritual body first explodes, and then reforms.
But in his case, the order is all mixed up.
The body is still a Plus, while the mask is being created first.
This is proof that he is resisting.
There's still a possibility that he will become a Soul Reaper again.
Let's watch a little longer.
And see if he truly becomes a Hollow.
Just for a little longer.
Ichigo, can you hear me?
Where am I?
Over here.
Who are you?
Who?
What are you talking about?
It's me...
I can't hear it.
I see.
It still can't reach you.
How sad...
How many times must I cry out before you can hear me?
There is no one in this world that knows me better than you do.
Huh?
What are you talking about?
Sorry, but I don't know anyone depressing like you.
Huh?
!
Hey!
How'd you?
!
I'm surprised.
How can you stay seated in a place like that?
If you can scream, I guess you have time to spare.
Quite a good sign.
Do not worry.
Soul Reapers rule death.
They control many spiritual beings.
I'm... not... a Soul Reaper now!
Remember!
That the Soul Reaper power that Byakuya Kuchiki snuffed out of you was merely the Soul Reaper power you received from Rukia Kuchiki!
Of course!
That is all he was after.
He thought that by destroying that, he could end this!
He was careless!
He overlooked the fact that you have Soul Reaper power of your own!
Huh?
My own?
Soul Reaper power?
That's right.
The power that was awakening due to Rukia Kuchiki's power, hid itself in the very depths of your soul an instant before Byakuya Kichiki's thrust.
Now find it!
If there ever is a time when you could find the power of the Soul Reaper that has hidden itself, then that time is now, when this world has begun its collapse.
Countless boxes are raining down, and in only one of them lies your Soul Reaper power.
Find it!
Will you cut out this nonsense?
!
I will not abide any excuses.
There is no time.
Before this world is completely destroyed, find it.
Or you will become a Hollow.
So what do I do?
How can I pick out one box out of all these, that contains the Soul Reaper power?
What do I do?
I just don't have the ability to search for spiritual energy to begin with.
I think Ishida said the same thing to me.
Ishida?
That's right... how did he find out I was a Soul Reaper?
You know?
It was some simple method...
Did you know?
He bragged about it...
but what was it?
Did you know?
The Spirit Ribbon of a Soul Reaper is red.
That's it!
It's this one!
What the... - ?
!
The handle of a Zanpaku-to?
You've done well in finding it.
I hope that next time, you will hear my name.
Could you possibly be?
What are you doing?
!
It's crumbling!
Hurry and pull me out!
Huh?
!
This is the limit, Boss!
I am switching to Suppression mode.
Bakudo 99 Part 2:
Ban-kin!
First Incantation:
Bandage!
Second Incantation:
Hundred Dead Bolts!
Hey Tessai!
If you do that, he'll die!
There is no other way!
I can't hold him down any longer!
I must destroy him before he becomes a Hollow!
Final Incantation:
Fatal Seal!
This is it!
W-What?
!
Something's coming out!
W-What the heck is that?
!
Hey!
Is that you?
Answer, Orange head!
If you're alive, answer me!
Huh?
Shihakusho... and a mask?
Is he a Hollow?
Or a Soul Reaper?
Don't take me lightly!
Come at us if you want!
You didn't become a Hollow?
Congratulations!
You went and became a Soul Reaper again!
Well done!
Lesson Two cleared!
Shut up!
Hah!
Your number is up now that I came back alive!
I swore!
That when I got out of the hole alive, I'd kill you without fail!
Perfect timing.
With that spirit, we'll go right into Lesson Three.
Lesson Three has no time limit at all.
If you can use your Zanpaku-to to knock off my hat, then the lesson will be cleared.
Not bad, considering your Zanpaku-to is broken.
Of course!
And I haven't really gotten down to business yet!
No time limit, huh?
Forget that.
Let's end this in five minutes.
Sounds good.
Five minutes... and we'll end this, huh?
With much appreciation send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
I'll always be grateful for who you are.
I was casually walking through town
Around the time dusk fell and the city was bathed in red
It was an afternoon with crowds of people coming and going
I don't know why but I just stood there and watched
Then my cell phone started to vibrate and I made myself move hoping it could fill in this hole in my heart
You're not alone You see, everybody
We gotta hold each other up
With much appreciation
I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
I'll always be grateful for who you are.
In order to release the power of the Zanpaku-to, one has to discover its name and summon it.
Now then, can Ichigo find it?
1000 points says he can't 2000 points says I can!
Well then...
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently...
until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate, life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
Irregularities detected along western perimeter.
Security alert in Areas 3 through 8!
Repeat!
Irregularities detected along western perimeter.
Security alert in Areas 3 through 8!
What?
!
What's going on?
What's happening?
!
The wall is catching up to us!
The place we just ran through is collapsing!
If you have time to look back, you have time to run!
It's all over if the Restrictive Current swallows you up!
- Ishida!
- What's happening?
!
The fool!
It's that crazy get up he has on!
Hold it!
Do not use your Zanpaku-to.
The current entangles the spiritual body.
If you use your Zanpaku to, you will get caught too.
T-Thank you...
Huh?
!
Let's go!
Put me down, Chad!
I can run on my own!
Hey, guys.
Something's...
Something's coming!
What is that?
!
It's the Cleaner!
It appears once every seven days!
And this had to be the day!
Anyway, run!
It's incredibly fast!
Hurry!
We're close to the exit!
It's no good!
We can't outrun it!
Hinagiku!
Baigon!
Lily!
Santen Kesshun!
I reject!
Is everyone all right?
Wow!
Ichigo!
The way you land is so artistic!
Shut up!
Cripes...
That was something else.
This is more than I expected.
I never thought I'd use my extra cape so soon.
H-He brought a change of clothes...
I'm so glad...
No one seems to be hurt.
What's there to be glad about?
!
Owwee!
Were you not listening to me?
!
We're lucky the Restrictive Current made contact with just the shield area.
If it had been the Six Flowers themselves, you'd be dead now!
I-I'm sorry.
So what?
Don't be so hard on her.
As it turned out, thanks to Inoue, we came through without a scratch.
You do not understand how serious this is.
I-Is this the Soul Society?
Yes.
This place is known as the Rukon District, the Drifting Spirit Town.
This is where souls first live upon coming to Soul Society, and is on the perimeter of Seireitei where Soul Reapers live.
It's the poorest place in Soul Society, but also the freest, and has the largest population of souls in Soul Society.
Hmm...
But for all that, there's no one around here.
Huh?
What's that?
It looks so different on that side.
Oh that...
I got it!
That's where the Soul Reapers live...
the Sei whatever...
Awright!
Y-You fool!
Don't get too close!
You'll die!
Huh?
It's been a long time...
Huh?
Since someone tried to pass through the Seirei Gate without a travel permit.
You're a rare guest...
Welcome, kid!
So the Ryoka have landed outside the Seirei Gate.
Since they're on that side, there's no need for us to go.
Well...
Especially since on that side...
Jidanbo will be there.
Now come at me from anywhere...
Kid!
So huge!
Who is he?
!
He's too big to be human!
Just what is he?
His name is Jindanbo.
He was chosen from among the best in Soul Society to guard the White Road Gate, one of the four gates of Seirei.
Guard?
Which means we have to beat him to get inside?
Yes.
But that won't be an easy task...
In the 300 years that he has been on duty, no one has been able to break through the White Road Gate.
He is legendary for his power and strength.
So how do we fight a guy like that?
That's where your intelligence comes in.
I think, first, a meeting is in order to come up with a strategy.
Hey Ichigo...
Hey!
Chad!
Orihime!
Come back!
Come back, both of you!
Ichigo, wait...
I'm coming to help!
W-What is that?
!
He's crazy!
I don't like your manners.
You must be country bumpkins.
Now listen up.
We have rules in the city.
First, wash your hands when you return from outside.
Two, don't eat food that's fallen on the floor.
Three, when you fight, it's one on one.
My first opponent will be that kid...
with the candy hair.
You wait here quietly, until I'm done.
Inoue...
Huh?
I'll wait for my chance and open up a hole in this wall.
The instant I'm done, aim and shoot your Tsubaki at him through the hole.
What?
Are you still scheming something?
He has surprisingly sharp ears...
Yeah.
Hey!
Chad!
Orihime!
Ichigo!
Are you all right?
You're not hurt?
No, I'm alive and kicking!
Wait over there, we're...
About that, Orihime...
Can you and Chad just stay put?
Huh?
What're you saying, Ichigo?
That's...!
Never mind.
Don't worry, just wait.
No, I refuse!
Uryu!
Our time is limited!
Instead of just you, we have to attack together, and get going.
Oh, so you're there, Ishida?
I've been here all the time!
Quit saying irritating things at a time like this!
Geez, will you all shut up?
Can you do it?
Umm...
Probably.
- Probably?
!
What're you saying?
!
- Huh?
Do you understand the situation?
!
Cripes...
Look, don't worry.
How can I not worry?
!
I'll tell you something interesting...
My Soul Reaper strength was supposed to be restored in ten full days.
But I got it back in five.
So what do you think I did the remaining five days?
W-What were you doing?
Fighting.
For five days and nights,
I fought that Sandal Hat guy...
one on one.
I get it...
You learned the secrets of fighting...
Nope...
Huh?
He didn't teach me a thing.
But...
Stamina and guts...
I got 'em even if I didn't want 'em.
Are you done talking?
I don't remember asking you to wait.
You are a country bumpkin, after all.
You don't know your manners.
When someone waits for you...
you say, "thank you"!
What's happening?
!
What?
!
Just what are you?
Isn't it bad manners to attack before your opponent is ready?
Whoa!
H-He's laughing.
You're gutsy.
Good!
It's been decades since someone stopped my thrust.
All right!
This is great.
Today, I get to give it everything I've got!
Among those who tried to pass through here, there have been only three, including you, who were able to stop my first thrust.
However... not one has been able to stop... my second thrust!
Hmm...
Good, you're still standing.
I'm gonna keep coming!
Take this!
Jidanda Ten Strikes Festival!
One!
Two!
Three!
Four!
Five!
Six!
Seven!
What's happening?
!
Seven!
Eight!
Err...
Six!
Eight!
Now it's time for the finish!
W-What...?
!
W-Why...?
!
Why are you...still standing?
!
He's standing!
Kurosaki is still standing!
Kurosaki!
I get it!
What Ichigo learned from that guy was not about stamina or guts... or even the secrets of fighting!
Without a doubt, he has spiritual power beyond the norm of Soul Reapers...
But he's still clumsy at wielding that power...
What he lacked when he confronted other Soul Reapers... was experience!
And once he got that, he's...
Are you finished?
He's...!
Then it's my turn.
He's gonna be so strong, it'll be scary!
Not yet!
Not yet!
I'm not...finished yet!
Another axe?
!
Try this!
My final lethal attack!
Jidanda Banzai Strike Festival!
Sorry, but I'm gonna destroy those axes.
W-What?
!
That Kurosaki...
What'd he just do?
!
That giant... went flying!
Hah!
Man, that was close!
I slipped and fell on my butt!
Huh?
What's that look?
I'll bet you think I went flying.
Hah!
What're you saying?
I can't be blown away, never happen!
That's why country bumpkins are such a pain.
Just wait, I'll use my axes again and...
A-Axes...?
Hmm...
Jidanbo's axes were destroyed in one blow.
What?
!
Those giant axes?
!
Hey, say something.
M My...axes!
Huh?
!
They're broken!
They're broken!
My axes are... broken!
Now, he's crying.
What's going on?
It sounds like a siren.
Er... hey...
I'm sorry about this.
For breaking your axes...
I didn't have to break both of them, I know...
Bad of me...
Y You're... not bad.
You and I are enemies, but you're concerned for me, a loser...
What a big heart...
You're really great.
Err...
Well, when someone cries that much, anyone would want to console him.
Meanwhile, I'm acting like a kid over mere axes...
I'm an embarrassment as a man!
It's... my loss!
Huh?
A complete loss!
As a warrior...as a man...
I lost to you completely!
It's been 300 years since I became the guard of the White Road Gate.
I've never once lost!
You are the first man to defeat me.
Pass!
I, Jidanbo, grant your permission to pass through the White Road Gate!
Huh?
Y-Yeah!
Can all of us really pass?
Yes.
I lost to your leader.
I have no right to stop you.
What?
!
Kurosaki is our leader?
!
No way!
Why're you so upset?
Your name is Kurosaki?
Yeah, Ichigo Kurosaki.
Ichigo, huh?
That's a cute name.
Shut up!
Ichi means "one" and go stands for "protect"!
It's not cute!
Take care, Ichigo.
I don't know why you are passing through this gate...
But on the other side, they're all strong.
I know that.
All right.
As long as you know.
Okay, I'll open the gate so stay back.
Don't get scared.
I'll give it one heave.
Ohhh...!
- Wow!
- Wow!
A-Amazing...!
I never thought that thing could be lifted...
What's the matter?
Why're you standing there like that?
Did something happen?
Who's that...?
!
Captain of Squad 3...
Gin Ichimaru.
With much appreciation send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
I'll always be grateful for who you are.
I was casually walking through town
Around the time dusk fell and the city was bathed in red
It was an afternoon with crowds of people coming and going
I don't know why but I just stood there and watched
Then my cell phone started to vibrate and I made myself move hoping it could fill in this hole in my heart
You're not alone You see, everybody
We gotta hold each other up
With much appreciation
I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
I'll always be grateful for who you are.
A mysterious wild boar gang attacks!
The only one who can stop this outrageous bunch is you!
And so, I leave it to you, Kurosaki!
Right!
Pararira pararira...
Hey, don't run away, you guys!

Damn!
What incredible reiatsu!
this kind of Menos Grande is...
But I should be okay.
The torso's disappeared!
It split?
No.
It was two separate bodies from the start!
There is still a way for me to fight!
Feel the wrath of battle and accept this sacred chalice!

High speed regeneration!

Such awkwardness.
Uryuu.
YOU...
Ryuuken!
Is that how you talk to your father?
Uryuu?
How annoying.
Don't you know?
The only way to deal with high-speed regeneration is finish the job before it can regenerate.
What's... going on?
Why do you have...
Quincy powers?
!
why do you hate the Quincy so?
Because it won't bring any money.
haven't you?
That's why you discarded your Quincy powers long ago.
And that is why you are a fool.
didn't I?
I have no interest.
You have no talent.
like yours.
Ishida Ryuuken. bequeathed all of his power and skills... to the man permitted to call himself The Last Quincy'.
The name of only one man.
I did it!
I want to be a Quincy just like you!
Uryuu.
becoming a full Quincy is not an easy matter.
The Quincy cross!
and he destroyed it wit ljust one shot!
Uryuu.
You are still an amateur. and then proceeded to lose your completely undeveloped powers.
you were unable to fulfill your objectives.
I am able to restore your lost powers to their previous state.
That's not possible!
You don't believe me?
It's the truth. there is one condition.
And that is?
you will have nothing to do with the Shinigami.
W-W-W-Wait a sec!
Let's stop tearing around town!
Okay?
!
Kurosaki Ichigo?
Change back to your Shinigami form immediately!
Shit!
Why do things like this only happen to me?
!
Shit!
What is it?
Look there!
It's a Hollow!
It's huge.
And right nearby is...
That's Kon's reiatsu!
Kon?
!
What's he doing?
I'm not lchigo!
Is this what you call fighting?
Believe me!
Wha?
No way!
Have I been eaten?
so stop talking like you're dreaming!
Kon!
What are you doing in Ichigo's body?
Can't you see?
I'm being chased by a humongous Hollow!
That's so pathetic!
You're a Modified Soul and all you can do is run?
you know!
you're right.
He does look pretty fast.
flee-happy legs of yours.
You piss me off...
A Hollow!
Not really.
You were lying?
!
We'd be happy to help if you're having trouble.
Right?
they say that there are no accidental meetings and that no kindness goes unrewarded.
Wh-Who the hell would ask you guys for-!
Kurosaki Ichigo?
There you are!
how is that different from what I was doing on my own?
Wait and see!
It's what comes next!
There!
Turn there!
What?
YOU!
Kurosaki Ichigo!
you've finally turned into a Shinigami.
Then I shall take your life!
Bring it on!
You sure this'll work?
Please leave the Hollow dispatching to us.
let's go.
Understood.
He vanished!
I owe you one.
You tricked me!
How pathetic!
Kurosaki Ichigo!
Do you think you can run from me?
Kon!
Jeez!
Those guys are no help at all!
He didn't believe me when I told him I wasn't Ichigo.
And why's his mask half off with his face showing?
!
Enough!
but I've had enough.
You refuse to return to your Shinigami form?
So be it.
bones and all!
No good...
Legs won't move...
Wh-What the...?
my.
didn't I?
I told you to keep it on you at all times.
That guy?
It can't be!
Mr. Hollow.
But Ichigo's not home right now.
how about playing with me instead?
Who the hell are you?
my bad.
I haven't introduced myself yet.
I am Kurosaki Isshin.
Wh-What the?
This reiatsu...
But this other enormous reiatsu is...a Hollow?
he just now noticed?
Is this guy really okay?
The Shinigami reiatsu that just appeared...
I don't recognize it.
Who can it be?
Ichigo?
I'm not finished talkin' yet!
I'll pass!
I said I'm not finished yet!
I don't want to hear it! I have no desire to become friends with you all!
I'm a Shinigami!
I am not your friend!
this ain't gonna be easy.
hello?
Its Hirako.
Is this Sarugaki-san's cell phone?
Sorry.
Wrong number.
I couldn't help it.
Ya don't have to shout in my ear!
It's just a matter of time.
Let's be patient.
Kurosaki...
I see.
So you're Kurosaki Ichigo's... yeah.
Heads up!
Take it Kon!
It's originally a protective amulet that was made for you to carry around.
H-He even knows my name!
When did you figure out that I wasn't Ichigo?
Right from the start.
Ever since the day we went to the cemetery to visit Masaki's grave and I noticed for the first time that you were in his body.
Think about it.
I have not once called you Ichigo while you were in his body.
I may look like a fool but my senses are quite keen.
my best friends trio?
too?
isn't it?
Kurosaki Ichigo is of pure blood.
then I am satisfied that I have fallen behind him.
filthiest and most infuriating Hollow of them all! I have no interest in you.
The reason I came here this evening was to kill Kurosaki Ichigo.
you should know his whereabouts.
Show me Kurosaki Ichigo!
you know.
I'm a non-interventionist when it comes to parenting.
You lie!
You're pretty tight with your daughters.
not different.
They're an exception!
It's like night and day!
I came to cut you down!
it'll cause problems.
You came to cut me down?
!
You talk pretty big for someone who looks like a Shinigami!
Surely you don't think I am just some normal Hollow?
!
Watch!
And witness the true form of my power!
H-He's friggin' huge!
bigger!
you say?
Don't group me with the likes of them!
We are the...
Arrancar!
A group of Hollow who have removed their masks and attempted to obtain the powers of a Shinigami.
What's that?
You're quite well informed.
then you also understand that you cannot beat this sword.
A Zanpakutou?
!
It's friggin' huge!
That's right!
The size of a Zanpakutou is proportional to the amount of spirit power of he who wields it!
boy!
really?
let's give it a try!
fool!
Then embrace your death and taste bitter regret!
I'll teach you the basics.
All captain class Shinigami are controlling the size of their Zanpakutou.

they would all have to swing around a
Remember this.
You cannot gauge an opponent's strength by how large his Zanpakutou is.

Have you come to understand that you have no chances of winning?
What?
!
underling?
D-Damn you!
Could it be that you didn't notice that I swapped places with my impostor... quite some time ago?
Inaba. but it seems you didn't realize you were trying to bite a tiger.
how long could you have...
How long?
What preposterous questions you ask.
Ever since the vice-captains of your invading army appeared in the Human World.
I'm afraid to say that your mediocre servants failed to fully comprehend my power. the people charged with recapturing Soul Society failed miserably in their attempt.
I was forced to wait this long to reveal my true identity.
How magnificent.
Captain Kurotsuchi.
However... you are all still in the power of my technique.
How deeply fascinating.
The depths of anger to which you've managed to drive me are another thing you shouldn't... forget.
Who's there?
!
Huh?
Kurosaki-kun...
You guys... does that mean I'm in the Human World?
you are.
Kurosaki-san.
Urahara-san...
Nozomi...
Weren't you supposed to defeat Kagerouza?
Huh?
Weren't you supposed to get it done quickly and come back to us?
Sorry...
I told you to come back safely... at any rate.
Renji...
Were you the one who saved me from the Capturing Ram?
Huh?
I just found you collapsed in the Severed World and brought you back here.
Then who was that Shinigami?
it seems you really were engulfed by the Capturing Ram.
Urahara-san?
sort of.
how about some tea?
Inaba.
I never imagined you to be the type that would sacrifice his body so easily.
Did you believe that you could restrain me with such feeble attacks?
Don't push your luck.
That technique was only meant to buy time.
I see... that must be Ashisogi Jizou.
Ashisogi Jizō 疋殺地蔵:
Leg-Cutting Jizō
Yet I believe I have already spoken of this.
All of this is within the bounds of my technique.
my...
Ashisogi Jizou paralyzes the four limbs of whatever it cuts.
you should already be unable to move.
But it seems you have a flawless countermeasure you want to boast about.
Then shall we give it a try?
I will very kindly close my eyes for a while.
feel free to counterattack any way you like.
what's wrong?
Captain Kurotsuchi.
then you...
You... you...
Something wrong?
so why?
!
This is why.
What?
!
I took the opportunity to inject you with this drug.
This is a medicine which suspends the thinking process.
Suspends... thinking?
! you would have instinctively defended yourself.
But you stopped to think.
the right way to respond...
You mean you blocked those thoughts?
!
Inaba... do you know what a scientist fears most?
It is memory loss.
which we then develop and allow to mature over time.
something that can never be traded away.
you will completely lose the ability to think.
you will forget how to use all of the knowledge you have accumulated up till now.
Those who find themselves far from the fixed sections of the Severed World ultimately doomed to be engulfed by the Capturing Ram or the Capturing Flow... and meet their death.
Everyone knows that much.
much as Kurotsuchi-san did.
But it should not be possible to be saved after being engulfed by the Capturing Ram the way Kurosaki-san was.
Then was I-
I have no idea.
Huh?
what happened to you is completely unprecedented. but I wouldn't expect any quick answers.
Some big help you are.
However...
I have discovered the reason for Kagerouza's obsession with the Severed World.
His reason?
Indeed. but that is not his true goal.
What do you mean?
he is studying the Severed World for a separate reason.
He seeks... to obtain a certain piece of information concealed within it.
Come on now.
What are you doing?
Finish him already!
sir!
but to stop my thoughts...
I shall admit I am powerless.
or your body will...
What about my body?
!
It is clearly losing strength.
What the?
!
I'm sorry for being so weak! the feeling of anger overrides the effect?
This is quite a surprise.
Hmm?
What now?
A soul pill?
that is no soul pill.
Mod souls?
Precisely.
Kagerouza's motive for research on the Severed World is to retrieve information on mod souls which is concealed within.
What's a mod soul?
I know!
I know!
I know!
I know!
1954)}Allow me to explain.
something called Project Spearhead took place in Soul Society.
Humans who lost their souls at death were to be injected with artificial souls specially designed for combat and those souls would be used as an anti-Hollow vanguard.
Haven't seen those crappy drawings in a while.
Crappy what?
just let it go.
Art school reject.
no-
The project's proposal was quickly rejected.
That is how the development of the mod souls came to pass.
Kon is a mod soul that survived.
Have you lost the power of speech?
And I was going to ask you how you obtained the technology to create mod souls.
Kurotsuchi Mayuri.
I was a being on a different level to all of you from the start.
What is it this time? this is but one application of mod soul technology.
Are you taken aback?
you have forced the mod soul you swallowed to take the effect of my medicine?
but enough for this.
Wait!
But how did you know that mod soul data was hidden in the Severed World?
By chance.
I sensed something strange about some of the spirit particles that had vaguely attached themselves to him.
and fragments of ancient mod soul development data emerged.
Kagerouza must have used such data to create his captain-class mod souls.
It's true.
Nozomi...
How did you learn there was mod soul data concealed in the Severed World?
You may as well cough up the confession.
We're going to find out everything in a little while anyway.
Who are you really?
Nozomi-chan?
Kujou-san?
Very well.
I shall tell you.
He is...
I am... the creator of the mod souls.
The creator?
Enough of your fantasies.
They are no fantasies!
What?
! would be destroyed.
The mod souls I aimed for... as well as possessing superior abilities.
Do you even understand?
I was truly treading in God's domain!
But it was judged dangerous.
Project Spearhead was canceled because the very notion of using the dead as weapons of war was vetoed as immoral.
officially.
But the truth lay elsewhere.
The ability to freely wield the power of mod souls was judged to be a threat.
Yes.
They were afraid.
They feared my research.
I could not forgive their imbecility.
I transformed my exhaustive research of the matter and cast it deep into the Severed World.
he extracted the data from the Capturing Ram.
So that's what happened.
That's how it is?
You mean we mod souls were created by that bastard?
!
Kon...
I see why you can't trust me if that's true.
that's not true!
Then what is?
!
You never told me any of this until now!
stop it!
I guess all I was to you in the end was another one of Kagerouza's creations!
Kagerouza wasn't the one who created you.
How do you know?
Well...
What does a scientist fear most?
You claimed that it was memory loss.
I concur.
I can't bear to fathom the possibility that my creations could be forgotten and buried in the abyss of time.
Is that why you decided to revive Project Spearhead?
and I will rule Soul Society by means of my invading army!
What is this reiatsu?
!
I have merely been restricting the reigai's power until now!
bear witness to their true strength!
Furthermore...
You revived them?
!
Hmph.
They are mod souls.
he can insert them into countless backup reigai.
Countless?
Surely you jest.
Not even you could create that many reigai capable of withstanding so much reiatsu.
Kyouraku!
We really stepped in it this time.
This just keeps getting more interesting!
Yoruichi-sama!
I know.
Huh?
Soi Fon!
Do not imagine that you have any hope of winning with your body as it is.
Well...
The very first mod soul.
That's who I am.

The first thing I thought was I wish I hadn't noticed.
The next thing I thought was I have to get away from here.
And the only thing I know is that thing is dangerous.
Every cell in my body was tingling telling me...
You have to run and to keep others from panicking keep calm and act as if nothing was happening.
hurry!
It disappeared...

I have to change.
you two go ahead without me.

You're so cute.

I feel perfectly fine.

But...
It's okay.
Of course...
You do look really cute when you're crying but your face is much prettier when you smile.

Why...
My hand... it moved on its own!
No!

What in the world is happening?

What is this?

What did you do to Chizuru-chan?
!
'Hime?
I just used a bit of my power.
Power?
I'm not fond of fighting so I control my opponents' bodies with these seeds from my forehead making humans fight amongst themselves.
How could you... let's begin.
What?
!
What's wrong?
What?
What's going on?
What're you jerks doing?

But I can at least tell where it is.
that is.
over there!

Get a clu-
Tatsuki...
Chizuru!
I think something's wrong with me.
Tatsuki-chan!
How do you feel?
The seed I just shot into you will soon grow roots in your body and control it.
that means your body will do what I want.
cry.
Shut up!
Huh?
shut up!
Let Orihime go!
Excuse me?
Do you understand your situation?
You've lost almost all control of your body.
how about it?
come on-
DAMMIT?
!
Let go!
I said let go!
Let go this instant!
I don't need to control you!
Die!
Tatsuki-chan!
O-Orihime...
Don-Don't cry...
Ori...
Orihime.
It's such a warm and wonderful color.
What the hell's with your hair?
It pisses me off!
No!
why did you cut your hair?
No reason.
I just felt like it.
What're you standing around looking dazed for?
let's walk home together.
The reason I could grow my hair again was because of Tatsuki-chan.
I know I'll never have to cut my hair short again.
the length of my hair is a symbol of my reliance on Tatsuki-chan.
Thank you for protecting me until now.
So don't cry.
Ori... hime... this time...
I'll protect you.
What?
!
Tatsuki-chan said you chose the wrong person to pick a fight with.
But that's not it.
You chose the wrong person to hurt.
I won't forgive anyone who hurts Tatsuki-chan!

I put up a shield inside the enemy and reject their physical bonds.
it means I split the enemy into halves.
Chant!
My name is Tsubaki!
Tsubaki!
Sacred Solitary Cutting Shield!
I reject!
Impossible...
I did it...
Orihime-san!
Orihime!
Orihime-san!
I guess using all of us right away was too much.
But...
Orihime-san stuck it out really well.
Huh?
The old dude ain't here.
Is this really the place?
You're sure?
I said I was sure!
He really was knocked out right her-
Karin!
You liar!
It's not a lie!
That old dude really was hurt and...
Karin.
Dad knows.
I have been so busy with work lately that I could not play with you at all.
I did not know you wanted time with me so badly that you would lie.
leap joyously to your father's bosom!
dumbass.
let's go back to the house.
I've been getting a bad feeling about this.
It huuuuurts!
it's no use.
Everything's fine over here.
Alright... 136)}Urahara Store
Huh?
Sado-kun?
you're awake.
Morning.
M-Morning.
where are we?
Beats me.
So you're finally awake.
Who is he?
I don't know.
it seems we were saved by him.
That is correct.
wherever shall I begin...
Shit!
Ishida!
I'm gonna make you cry no matter whatl
I'm starting to lose my ability to kill them with a single attack.
But...
What's going on?
There's too many for them all to have been drawn by that bait.
It's almost like some other huge power is attracting them.
But that stuff is irrelevant.
I will avenge you for sure.
no. 4!
Byakurai!
Damn!
This Hollow is an utter weakling!
I cannot even defeat one that's this weak...
This means my power hasn't recovered in the slightest?
!
Ichigo?
Nee-san!
you're Kon.
Even being kicked like this is delightful.
This isn't the time to be talking like an idiot!
the fact that you're in Ichigo's body means he's changed to Shinigami.
behin-
Good.
Looks like you two are alright.
this is the first time we've talked one on one.

This is a fight between the Shinigami and I.
What?
I don't intend to let a single person in this town die.
Even if Kurosaki Ichigo runs out of strength I will stake my life to protect the people of this town.
While he...
While the Shinigami watch I will protect everything from the Hollows.
If I cannot then there is no meaning in this fight.
What in the...
Hold on a second there...
Yeah.
Shinigami and Hollows you can't suddenly tell us that and expect...
Then you deny the fact that both of you were recently attacked?
But that's...
Kurosaki Ichigo is fighting the Hollows as a Shinigami.
And you two were affected by the extraordinary spirit power that oozes from him.
That's how it is.
whether or not to open the door that has appeared before you is up to each of you.

I'll be finished fine-tuning it in a minute.
So there really is no way except through the Severed World.
isn't it?
I wouldn't say "completely.
What do you mean?
It would seem that Kagerouza's skills fall short of being able to control the Capturing Ram. been popping up all over the place?
right?
So I developed a hypothesis.
There is no need for your rambling explanations.
he diverted the temporal axis traversed by the Capturing Ram.
Have a gold star.
The Sixth Squad Captain is on top form as always. his ability to control time in this way must surely be limited.
he would have been wasting all the time between your entry into the Severed World and the Ram's arrival.
So what do you suggest?
I have secured an area immediately behind the Capturing Ram which is free of Kagerouza's influence.
It is a narrow temporal axis which will give you a chance to move within the Severed World.
I'm afraid you will have to run.
I can only buy you a few dozen seconds at most.
the Capturing Ram will have you for breakfast.
leave the secured area and you will be in the palm of Kagerouza's hand.
you might never be able to escape the Severed World.
Kurosaki-kun!
Are you all right?
Inoue.
More or less.
How are the others?
We have brought them here and have already begun treatment.
I see.
Glad to hear it.
would you mind checking this girl here for injuries too?
Nozomi?
You OK?
Pervert!
Glad you're feeling better.
What's he playing at...
You're just like each other.
Mega pervert.
I am nothing like this thing!
Right back atcha!
I'm not a closet pervert like Ichigo!
you...
Kurosaki-kun?
Let me heal you up.
It's no big deal.
Ya mean that?
Kurosaki-kun!
Is he dead?
!
Going flying from a teensy kick like that.
You call that "no big deal"?
Anyone'd go flying if you kicked them from behind all of a sudden!
And anyway!
Weren't you supposed to have gone to Soul Society?
I'm on my way now.
Then how about I come-
Forget it!
You'd just be going to your death the way you are now.
Whatever.
OK?
Don't worry!
Ken-chan can't die!
Yachiru.
Shan't!
Icchi?
Relax!
I ain't planning on getting killed or dying or whatever.
yeah.
Hurry up and get out of here.
Ichigo.
Bye-bye!
You're late!
We were on the point of leaving you behind.
Perfect timing.
just one word of warning-
We don't need that crap!
Hurry up and let us in!
right?
take care.
Here we go.
It would seem that the esteemed captains have invaded the Severed World.
Am I to take it that your invading army's assault on the Human World ended in failure?
You are a gifted scientist. it is only a matter of time before your goals move forever out of your reach.
you speak as if you were a teacher admonishing a student.
But I fear you are mistaken in one respect.
Do you believe that I have only been passively biding my time?
What is it?
Something's not right.
The Capturing Ram!
There is nothing difficult about running behind the Capturing Ram in and of itself.
The problem is that their reiatsu is so high.
The walls of the Severed World react to spirit particles.
You mean the Capturing Flow will accelerate proportionally to the captains' reiatsu?
Yes.
This would also have been taken into account.
But there must be more to it than that.
Most perceptive.
but the time in the surrounding area is open to manipulation.
So that Kagerouza bastard had some tricks up his sleeve after all.
Doesn't matter!
All we have to do is get through.
Komamura?

It's not like we can go back for him now.
he's not the type to die from a little thing like that.
We have no time to waste.
Captain Hitsugaya and Captain Zaraki.
But Captain Komamura's...
Only a single casualty?

It is still in its infancy.

that would be pointless.

We'll have to face them one way or another.
But our only target is Inaba Kagerouza.
Let's split up here and each make our way to the Twelfth Squad compound.
I may as well head that way.
No objections.
it's over there!
I know that much!
I'm heading that way.
Then let's regroup at Kagerouza's.
The direction Zaraki's headed in... the reiatsu over there...
Ken-chan...
Yeah.
Hey.
I've been waiting for this.
Figures.
Looks like you worked out what I'd be thinking.
I didn't.
Then why'd ya come?
I just wanted to find out how strong I was.
right?
Come at me for real from the start.
If you really are strong...
I'll be happy even if I lose.
Yachiru.
Entertain me!
Looks like they're both really Ken-chan.
Give it your all from the start!
If you don't...
You'll die!
Says the dead man!
What's this?
I heard reigai were supposed to be stronger than the originals.
Don't disappoint me.
Relax.
me!
What a shame.
I said I'd be happy even if I lost... but I'm taking it back after all.
I don't wanna lose to a weakling like you!
Isane. do not commit any further acts of folly.
My word... but you will never be able to remove General Yamamoto.
Indeed... it is not just General Yamamoto.
You have been underestimating all of us.
What's so funny?
this is good...
I haven't laughed this much in a long while.
right?
The same memories as me.
This is just like that time... it's so much fun I can hardly stand it!
reigai... then I'm the one having fun.
Just don't spout some crap like this is the end.
Not when it's just gotten so damn fun.
Of course not.
I'm finally starting to get into it too.
Do not think that the same trick will work over and over.

Kyouraku!
This is getting to be quite a handful... seriously.
The reigai's first priority is to keep me confined.
They must know that even sacrificing themselves to kill me may be beyond them.
Yet they fight as if it were no matter if they fell here and now.
As if their lives were already forfeit...
They must be...
Ken-chan!
Did the fat lady sing?
Who'd have thought I'd die at my own hands... that's all.
I've got no regrets.
Ken-chan!
Yachiru?
yeah.
I forgot.
right?
So I couldn't die.
What is this shit?
I've got something to take back too.
I just wanna win!
I don't care whether you're an impostor or whatever.
Don't make me laugh.
Ken-chan!
You just wanna win?
I see.
Ken-chan!
right?
'Course not.
you say?
You do not think so?
I would be hard pressed to claim I understood you all.
Captain Unohana... could the same not be said of you?
What do you mean?
This is what I mean.
Captain Unohana.
It would be unreasonable of me to face a captain of your power without a plan.
many vice-captains traveled to and from the Human World as part of the World Transfer Area purification activities.
I took the opportunity to make certain adjustments to the Senkai Gate in Soul Society.
I used it to gather a small amount of spirit particles from Shinigami.
I created Mod Souls indistinguishable from the originals and placed them inside reigai.
That is the conceit behind the formation of my invading army.
The Senkai Gate...
Did it come to your attention?
Your spirit particles have already been collected.

You're still up here?

What's wrong?
It's nothing.
have you ever heard of knocking?
Sorry about that.
wait!
This is my room!
You'll be late for dinner.
Wait up!
Excuse me.
If it isn't Captain Kuchiki.
What are you doing?
Well...
The soldiers whose pills were shattered in the recent fighting are as yet incomplete... but they are nearly there.
What of yourself?
I am as you see me.
You mean...?
Indeed.
Hitsugaya and Komamura.
It is about time for us to set out for the Human World.
before she escaped she saw the reigai vastly amplify their combat abilities by releasing the limiters on their wrists.
it will take time for the General to make a complete recovery.
We are facing a grave situation.
The enemy have made their objective crystal clear.
Our only option is surely to place Kujou Nozomi in confinement somewhere far away while we prepare countermeasures.
For what they're worth...
Could the captains really be dead after all?
Of course they ain't!
Huh?
There ain't no way in hell Captain Zaraki went down that easily!
then where... you piece of crap!
I'm going to fight!
Nozomi...
Now hang on!
but you're no match for that guy!
Kagerouza's Zanpakutou has the power to record space and reconstruct it at will.
But my Zanpakutou will be able to counter him...
I think.
aren't you?
So what is this ability of yours?
I haven't exactly regained all my memories yet... but I'm sure of this.
This is getting us nowhere.
and maybe you can't.
We ain't betting our lives on crap like that.
And why do we gotta protect her anyway?
All we have to do is fight them and win.
That's all it'll take.
Where are you going?
There's no point in talking about this any more.
That guy is kind of a dick.
I mean?
we cannot allow you to fight.
But my ability is... it's real!
I can almost remember my sword's name!
right now there's no point in asking us to believe you.
I'll wake it up for you.
Boss!
it would seem they've fallen for it.
Then on to the next stage?
If you'd be so kind.
we'll just have to establish dimensional stasis from our end.
Then we have quite the job to do.
Is this Urahara Kisuke's work?
I see now.
but I do not expect such feeble efforts to buy him a great deal of time.
This isn't enough!
Give me more!
Nozomi!
This kind of special training is definitely way too much for you!
pervert!
This is the only way to awaken a dormant Zanpakutou!
but-
Shut up!
It's fine!
This training technique will do it for sure!
Did she just... absorb his reiatsu?
I can do this!
Next!
Gotcha!
How about this?
Here I am.
Ikkaku?
Does it bother you?
As if.
All that bothers me is wonderin' when those reigai are going to turn up.
Let's take a quick break.
I don't need one.
Don't sweat it.
you'll end up making more mistakes.
Nozomi! and cool down for a bit.
I don't need it!
Where are you going?
To splash some water on my face.
right?
You think you can get through this by putting on a brave face?
Huh?
Stop it.
you're just gonna hurt yourself.
What?
I'm still-
I ain't denying that you've got some power to you.
But that ain't enough to survive a real battle.
you're just going to die.
I was... planning to die.
But somone told me to live.
I've listened to all your words.
This time it's my turn to save lives.
I'll gladly die fighting.
I only got one wish.
To die fighting under that man.
Nothing else.
You idiot. it doesn't matter whose words you've been listening to.
Let's go!
Bring it on!
What is this reiatsu?
Whoa.
Renji!
We're under attack.
the reigai have fallen for Urahara-san's trap in the Severed World.
What?
!
But Nozomi hasn't regained her Shikai yet.
let's get her somewhere safe!
Ichigo.
Do you even understand what's going on?
nowhere is safe.
I need to get my Shikai back as soon as possible.
You heard her.
Not you too...
Yeesh...
I'll help out too.
Renji!
We've got no time to stand around chatting.
Yeah!
Looks like I got here first.
Are you gonna fight me?
That's right!
I didn't feel like hangin' around with Ichigo and company.
I'm fighting.
That's all there is to it!
What was that?
That reiatsu...
Is it Ikkaku-san's?
Is someone fighting a reigai?
Ikkaku!
I wouldn't do that.
Are you going to waste Ikkaku's sacrifice?
He's buying time.
For her.
Madarame!
We'll back you up.
Don't get in the way.
This is my fight.
Are you still saying that stuff?
you guys have plenty of other people to fight.
What?
More reigai?
They're coming.
I'll take care of this one.
You get ready for the rest.
Ikkaku!
Sorry for the wait.
Now there's no one to interrupt us.
Let's make this a proper duel!
You don't stand a chance against me!
you're still standing.

You're all trembly!
Shut up!
keep going!
Sure thing!
Come at me again!
Right!
how long are you planning to keep this up?
it'll be no use.
You need a proper clash of reiatsu for this to work.
What?
The guy was all talk.
Guess I'll finish ya and be on my way...
What's this supposed to be?
It ain't over!
How boring.
you didn't stand a chance against me.
How about you judge that after you see this!
What do you mean?
Exactly what I say.
but all of you are pulling your punches without even realizing it.
her Zanpakutou will never awaken.
You need to strike with all the killing intent of your true reiatsu.
you will die.
That's all there is to it.
I understand.
Please do it.
H-Hold on!
This is going way too far!
I don't care!
Nozomi...

Will you say something?

Are you sure you're up for this?
Yes.
Definitely.

Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently...
until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate, life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
I don't have any sense...
of being in school right now.
And I can't feel the fact that I was beaten by those guys from Soul Society... almost killed by them.
Or the fact that she's not here right now...
Or the fact that not one of my classmates remembers Rukia.
Bohahaha...
Say, are you still into that?
So what?
The time's ripe for me.
Orihime, have you made plans for summer vacation?
Not yet.
Orihime, then come and stay at my place.
My parents will be going abroad.
No way!
Why not?
I know exactly what you're up to!
- Is this what it means...
- I'm not even thinking
- to go back to the Soul Society?
- About bathing together or anything!
What are you blabbering about?
!
You disappear from this world and from people's memories...
Every evidence of her existence disappears... into white.
Now then...
That's about it for reminders.
All right, students, don't die before September!
Class dismissed!
Yes!
That Ishida cut class, after all.
I thought he might still remember Rukia.
Ichigo!
Turn!
Turn!
Turn!
Turn!
Now then, where's the watermelon?
No!
That's not it!
That's right!
Summer means the sea!
And the sea means summer!
And so, I, Keigo Asano, am planning a 10-day trip to the seaside from tomorrow!
Fireworks, scary outings, and even a co-ed outdoors bath!
Lots and lots of things to do, both fun and embarrassing!
Sorry, I have plans, so I'll pass.
I'm sorry, too.
I'm not too keen on the ocean.
I've got an inter-high tournament, so I can't go.
If Orihime and Tatsuki aren't going, then I guess I won't...
I can't go this time, either.
I'm sorry, I'm leaving for Hawaii tomorrow.
What?
!
With that older girlfriend?
!
Actually, with her and her nine other friends, so that makes 11 of us including myself.
What?
!
What did you say?
!
Don't tell me it's you and ten other girls?
!
Why does he always pick on me?
!
Strange... nothing feels out of place.
Even with Rukia gone, our world continues to turn...
I guess...
Rukia was originally from the other world.
There was really no place for her here.
Then what'll I do?
Inoue...
What is it?
Something wrong?
Where did Rukia go?
Why has everyone suddenly forgotten about Rukia?
I thought you would know, Ichigo.
Then Rukia returned to the world she came from?
Yeah...
But what a shock.
That you were able to see through us.
Since when?
Ever since the incident with my brother.
Huh?
I see...
Yes...
I'm really grateful about that time.
You guided my brother...
I'm sure he's happy on the other side.
I can feel it.
Really?
Yes.
I wonder if Rukia is doing well on the other side, too.
She probably has family and friends, right?
I have to bring her back.
Huh?
But... if she's happy there...
She's in a predicament where she could be killed any time.
Well then, you'll probably say this:
Who cares if she has family or friends over there?
As long as she's alive, we'll be able to meet again.
If she's dead, it's all over.
You already know what you want to do, right?
She was really here.
And her place is here.
Thank you, Inoue!
Chad...
Kurosaki Clinic
How boring!
It's summer vacation and Ichigo goes off without us!
Yuzu, it's about time you...
All right!
How about sleeping in Dad's bed tonight?
Quit your jokes!
And just talk in your dreams!
Oh, just thinking about that makes me feel uneasy.
Gee... those words really hurt me.
Good morning, Lieutenant Abarai.
Mornin'!
Wait!
Wait!
If you fly away, I'll get in trouble!
I guess I have no choice...
Hi!
I'm Jennifer.
I'm a blood type A, Pisces.
E-cup bra size and...
What are you doing?
!
Renji!
Aren't you off duty today?
I'm here to check on the prisoner.
Is she still sulking?
I'm not sulking.
Then, why don't you eat?
I'm just not hungry, "Mr. Lieutenant."
What?
!
You got a problem that I'm a Lieutenant?
!
Not really.
Way to go, Mr. Lieutenant!
You are so strong, Mr. Lieutenant!
Your eyebrows look so weird, Mr. Lieutenant!
Why you...!
I'll kill you!
Come out of there, you!
Say Renji...
Huh?
Am I really going to die?
Of course!
It'll be immediate execution for someone like you!
I see.
I guess so.
Huh?
Stupid!
I was just joking.
Just a joke.
Which is it, idiot?
Who's the idiot here?
Making us worry with your antics.
Captain Kuchiki is probably asking for clemency right now.
I wonder...
Fool!
He's your older brother!
As if he'd let his sister die.
No...
He would kill me.
Huh?
I know full well... what kind of man he is.
Forty years after being taken in by the Kuchiki family... he has never once looked at me.
URAHARA STORE CLOSED TODAY
Huh?
!
What is this?
!
Imagine!
A huge cavern beneath the shop!
Pipe down!
You don't have to yell.
I'm pretty damn surprised.
Then that's fine.
Let's get started with this "lesson" or whatever.
All right, as you wish.
Dammit!
What's the big idea?
!
Hard to breathe, huh?
When you're in the form of a soul.
Right now, your Soul Sleep, which is the wellspring of your spiritual energy, and the Soul Chain, the booster, have been destroyed.
In other words, your soul is like that of the average person who has no spiritual power.
So first, we must restore the spiritual power you have lost.
Then what do I do?
!
Well, rather than explain it, why don't we just do it?
Hey, are you ready?
Nice to see you.
Lesson one!
Please fight her.
Huh?
The rules are simple.
Lesson One will be over once either one of you are rendered immobile.
Please knock her out.
Are you kidding?
!
You expect me to hit a little girl like her?
I think it'll be quite difficult.
Please put those on properly.
Otherwise, you'll die.
This is so silly!
No way!
See?
Don't say I didn't warn you.
He isn't coming out.
Did he die?
I wonder.
Oh, there he is.
Oh, he's going after her!
Oops, he ran right past her.
Cripes!
What was that?
!
If I get hit with that, I'm dead!
Hey!
How do I put this on?
!
Ichigo, your forehead!
Your forehead!
Huh?
Like this?
And then, you yell as loud as you can:
Take this!
Power of justice!
Armor of justice!
Justice headband!
In place!
Okay, got it!
Awright!
As if I can do that!
See?
No time to feel embarrassed.
Take this!
Power of justice!
Armor of justice!
Justice headband!
In place!
Well, well, he actually did it.
Why you...!
Behind you!
Behind you!
Aw man!
Awright, come at me!
Dammit!
This thing isn't any good!
Unless I run around like this, I'll be killed!
Wait a minute!
If I can run around, it means I'm keeping up with her speed.
Then.!
Come!
Oh?
Hmm...
I can do it...
I won't aim for her face.
Just a little blow to her headgear.
Then, because of the difference in size, I can...
Dammit!
I got her face!
Safe!
One more time, please.
Congratulations!
Huh?
Lesson One is cleared!
Huh?
Why?
I lost to her, didn't I?
Oh, I didn't say a thing about downing Ururu to clear Lesson One.
But...
After all, she has the fighting skills to counter Soul Reapers.
No way can a human soul beat her.
By the way, are you still having trouble breathing?
Huh?
Now that you mention it...
Which means, the restoration of your spiritual energy was successful.
This lesson was for one-shot battles.
Whether you could dodge the first attack or not.
Spiritual energy increases fastest when the soul is in danger of being destroyed.
If you can raise your spiritual energy sufficiently, then you can dodge the punch and it's all good!
And if I can't...
You'll die.
Why didn't you say so first?
!
I had faith in you...
that you would succeed.
Now then, your spiritual energy is back.
So...
let's celebrate and...
Huh?
!
Go straight into Lesson Two!
Lesson?
Are you interested in taking it?
B-But, so out of the blue like that...
Rather, the problem is...
The cat.
What do you mean?
Hmm...
Ichigo has begun preparations to enter the Soul Society.
If you also want to use the powers that have awakened inside you, then take my lessons.
You can decide whether you're really going or not after that.
I'm going.
Chad...
I... um...
I won't force you.
Oh!
There!
There!
Uryu!
Hello!
Huh?
Orihime!
Chad!
What are you doing here?
We asked Yoruichi to follow your spiritual aura.
Yoruichi?
What are you doing?
Camping?
No!
You're training, huh?
Who's there?
!
Where are you looking?
Over here.
I'm Yoruichi.
Huh?
!
A cat?
!
A cat is...?
!
So?
What's the big deal just because a cat can talk?
Don't be such a wimp.
Yes, Uryu.
It's no big deal.
No...
I don't think it's strange if one is mildly traumatized by it.
Men have such a hard time adapting to things.
I'm sorry.
But what did you want with me?
Actually...
Ichigo is going to the Soul Society?
Ichigo is going to rescue Ruikia.
So I thought we should tell you, too...
Unfortunately, it's got nothing to do with me.
Rukia's life is in danger!
I'm a Quincy and I can't forgive myself for losing to a Soul Reaper.
That's why I train.
Rukia is not my concern.
I see...
You're doing your best in your own way, huh?
I'll think it over carefully again.
It's certain that I'm undergoing changes...
I'm afraid, but I want to know what it is.
See you, Uryu.
Sorry Orihime...
But I can't let anyone see this training.
Please watch over me, Sensei...
I'm gonna die!
Precisely.
Once the Chain of Fate is broken, you can no longer return to your physical body.
You'll just die.
Quit talking like it doesn't matter!
Then, let me tell you something that does.
The chain will begin the Encroachment at the point of severance.
And when it reaches your chest, you will become a Hollow...
and it will be the end.
What?
!
If you don't want to become a Hollow, you must become a Soul Reaper!
Huh?
!
Once you clear Lesson Two, you will regain the powers of a Soul Reaper!
Which you choose is your decision.
Hah!
You don't have to ask me that!
Okay!
Then let's do it.
Go!
Are you shocked?
By my ruse?
Hey hey...
It's awfully deep.
I did my best.
Owwee!
Wha...!
What are these?
!
Binding Spell 99 -
Restrict!
It was bold of me, but until this lesson is over, your arms shall be sealed.
Dammit!
Why you...!
Ichigo!
Climb back up here in that condition.
That is the lesson...
otherwise called Shattered Shaft.
Idiot!
As if I can do such a thing?
!
I don't think you have time to wonder whether you can or not.
At the bottom of the Shattered Shaft, you have 72 hours, or three days, before the chain is completely Encroached.
You must come back up here as a Soul Reaper before the time is up.
Otherwise, we'll have to kill you.
With much appreciation send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
I'll always be grateful for who you are.
I was casually walking through town
Around the time dusk fell and the city was bathed in red
It was an afternoon with crowds of people coming and going
I don't know why but I just stood there and watched
Then my cell phone started to vibrate and I made myself move hoping it could fill in this hole in my heart
You're not alone You see, everybody
We gotta hold each other up
With much appreciation
I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
I'll always be grateful for who you are.
Jinta!
Ururu!
How quickly do you think Ichigo can come back as a Soul Reaper?
I say five hours!
About 12 hours...
Well, I'll wager a thousand points on him not returning...
Hold it, you!
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently...
until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose

Not much left.
This side, too.
It's almost time to replenish.

Hey, I brought you breakfast.
Come on out!
Hey!
Hey!
I said breakfast-!
Huh?
She's not here...
Where'd she go?
That idiot!
Don't you think Brother's acting weird lately?
He eats so much more now.
And he always rushes back to his room.
Ichigo is 15 years old.
An impressionable boy in the springtime of life would only go and lock himself in his room for just... one thing-
Cut it out!
And quit analyzing me, dirty old man!
What are you saying?
!
It's because I'm your father!
Why can't you understand?
Who'd understand such a thing?
!
Your breakfast will get cold.
How peaceful...
Clean-up batter, Jinta Hanakari.
Here's the wind up and the pitch!
With a perfect back swing, he lets it go!
A homerun!
Jinta, you'd better get to work or Tessai will scold you.
Urahara Store Shut up, Ururu.
I'm not cleaning up out of fear of Tessai!
Huh?
Aren't you sweeping because you're scared?
I'm not scared!
Besides, you're too cocky!
You're my underling!
Am not!
I'm three years older than you!
I'm not talking about age!
I'm talking about rank!
W-Who are you?
!
Huh?
Never change, do you, runt?
Is the boss in?
Welcome...
Hey Jinta...
It's too early to open up shop.
Huh?
Ms. Kuchiki!
One moment, please.
I'll wake the boss up.
Sorry, but I'm already up today.
Good morning, Tessai, Jinta, Ururu...
And welcome,
Ms. Kuchiki.
I just received a delivery yesterday.
What would you like today?
One spare of the kikanshinki fuel...
and which rank?
The cheapest one.
"D" then.
And 60 pieces of Somafixer and...
This may be none of my business, but too much of this can be toxic.
If you over-synchronize with the gigai, it'll be quite painful when you leave it.
I know that, but...
Lately, my connection with the gigai has been weak.
And it's difficult to move my body.
Want me to check you out?
I'll give you a discount.
No, thank you!
Right.
By the way, has the thing I ordered been delivered?
Oh, yes it's here.
Ururu, get it from the storehouse.
Uh, yes!
It says "new item" on the box.
Um... new item... new item...
Oh...
Found it!
Is this the only kind you could get?
Don't say that.
That one's the second most popular and was hard to get.
But...
You can't fake it forever.
I know that.
Everyone, good morning!
Oh, good morning, Kuchiki.
You look so lovely again today, Kuchiki!
It's not like you.
Third period is over already.
I had to go home for something.
By the way, Kurosaki...
May I see you a moment?
Huh?
What is it?
If you need to talk, tell me here.
Are you all right, Kurosaki?
Oh no, I'd better take you to the infirmary!
Didn't she just hit him?
Nah, we didn't see that.
Here!
Huh?
What is it?
Gikongan, Substitute Soul Pills.
It's a capsule that will force a soul out of the body.
When one swallows that, a substitute sould will enter and the real soul can leave the body.
If there's ever a time when I'm not here and you confront a Hollow, use that and transform into a Soul Reaper.
It says "Soul Candy".
T-That's because the Women Soul Reapers Society complained that Gikongan didn't sound nice, so it was changed.
Why's it a duck?
Shut up!
I personally wanted the rabbit-shaped container, Chappie!
I see...
You wanted a rabbit, huh?
Why're you looking at me like that?
!
Are you belittling me?
!
I... didn't really get your explanation just now.
Take one!
Then you'll understand.
Huh?
My soul really did leave!
Are you shocked?
In that empty shell of a body, there's a substitute soul.
So no one will notice that your true soul is gone!
Oh!
Nice to meet you.
My name is Ichigo Kurosaki.
Huh?
My favorite phrase is "Early to bed, early to rise."
Early to bed, early to rise?
!
Isn't it amazing?
It's not amazing?
What IS that thing?
What part is like me?
!
Huh?
A mission.
Perfect timing.
Leave him here.
And we'll head for the site!
A-Are you crazy?
!
Let's go!
No way!
They'll know he's a fake!
Hey!
You!
Make sure you attend the next class!
Leave it to me, Master!
Take your time.
Huh?
Huh?
Defective Merchandise
Look closely.
What does it say?
Read it.
De... fective...
Merchandise?
Defective merchandise!
Defective!
You sold a customer damaged goods!
Get your act together!
You and your stupid bangs!
Oww!
Hey, hey...
No fighting.
But this Gikongan is going to be trouble.
I know.
We'd better take care of this right away.
Otherwise, who knows what he'll do?
Alright... feels great.
I finally found a mobile body.
Now I'm free.
Hey!
What are you doing?
!
Huh?
You're Kurosaki in ninth grade group three.
What did you just do?
That fence is broken!
W-What's with that look?
!
Huh?
!
He flew!
Hah hah, he's surprised all right.
Yahoo!
It's lunchtime!
This girl!
Don't get so excited over lunch.
What're you saying, Tatsuki?
A healthy high school girl comes to school just to eat her lunch!
Okay, okay, I get it, so sit down.
Tatsuki, what do you have for lunch?
I have bread with sweet bean jam.
How nice.
Unfortunately, I only have an ordinary lunch.
See?
You make your own bean-jam rolls.
Good girl!
Hime!
Let's eat lunch together!
Yeah.
OK.
Oh, how cute!
You bite into a whole loaf of bread and smile with crumbs around your mouth!
This is ninth grade, group three, right?
I got a bad feeling...
Y-You!
How did you get up here?
How?
You saw, didn't you?
I jumped.
Well, wasn't that amazing?
Are you surprised?
Maybe he came from the next class room through the window.
He jumped from the ground!
You saw it?
No, I didn't.
Righteous!
Everyone's eyes are on me!
They must think I'm amazing.
What a feeling!
And the girls in this class are good looking!
Every single one of them is above average...
I've been cooped up for so long...
Huh?
Oh!
Super size!
Hello, pretty girl.
Will you tell me your name?
Ichigo!
Do you know what you're doing?
!
This better not be some joke!
Hey, up close you're pretty cute too.
Huh?
!
Why the rush back to the classroom?
I'm worried... if he's doing okay.
You don't have to worry, he'll be fine.
I don't know about that.
I've been getting these bad vibes.
As you said, we'd better hurry.
Told you.
Why you!
Die!
Watch out!
What's the problem?
I just kissed your cheek.
What's the big deal?
You're not in grade school.
Shut up!
Stop her, Chizuru...
D-Don't be stupid!
How could I stop a beast like that?
Stop right there!
You...
He's coming, Ichigo!
Right!
Now, there's nowhere to run.
You, I mean, me!
Why?
!
Kurosaki...
What's he doing by himself?
Who cares?
!
W-What's going on?
!
It's a poltergeist!
So long!
What's going on with him?
He can't be...
No, there's no mistake... he's a...
Mod Soul!
Ichigo!
That was Kuchiki, right?
I didn't see...
I didn't see anything.
Who cares about that?
!
But Ichigo!
I'll never forgive him!
She's a demon.
Tatsuki...
Orihime?
Weren't you scared?
Poor Hime!
It's all right.
Think of it as just an attack by a stray dog.
No...
That wasn't Kurosaki.
Huh?
Dammit!
We lost him!
Lost me!
It's a moratorium.
What?
!
This is no time for your mumbo-jumbo talk!
I have to capture me, no, him!
You saw it, too!
The riot he caused in class.
I, I mean, he used my body and took advantage of
Inoue and Tatsuki and k-k-k...
Kissed them.
Arghh!
Don't say it!
How embarrassing!
Huh.
A kiss is like a greeting.
It's no big deal.
In the book I read recently, even worse things have happened to...
Don't lump it all together!
My classmates were grabbed and kissed!
That is a big deal!
What books do you read anyway?
!
After I built up my image so carefully!
He was building up his image?
You called him a Mod Soul, right?
Just what is that?
Once, a project called "Spearhead" was begun in the Soul Society.
Spearhead?
Yes.
A soul that has been modified for combat was placed into a person who had died and whose soul had left its body.
They were to be used to fight Hollows.
It was a despicable plan.
Mod Soul
These souls that were transformed for this project... once placed into a body, they could make one part of the body super-human...
An Artificial Soul made for fighting...
That is a Kaizo Konpaku, Mod Soul.
Do you understand so far?
Yeah.
That drawing of yours erased all the tension, though.
But the Spearhead Project was cancelled because it would force corpses to fight.
Furthermore, all the Kaizo Konpaku, Mod or Modified Souls that were in the development stage were ordered destroyed... but to think, some are still around.
Does that mean... that guy was created by the Soul Society... and rejected at the whim of the Soul Society?
!
Exactly that.
And you accept that?
!
It's not a matter of accepting or not.
Mod Souls must be destroyed.
That's the order of the Soul Society.
Do not forget.
The laws of the Soul Society are made for the purpose of protecting human souls!
Now let's go!
You want to get your body back, don't you?
!
I wonder how he feels in my body.
They were created thoughtlessly and condemned thoughtlessly...
But he survived somehow and found a body...
Yet he has to keep running.
I wonder what he's feeling?
Yay!
This is great!
Everyone's looking at me and they're in awe!
This is unbelievable!
There!
I heard that Mod Souls had all sorts of power.
I'm glad my power makes me stand out!
Go!
Huh?
What's going on?
P.E. Is so boring!
Cutting class...
Perfect!
Darn!
Lost again!
Fight!
Who do you think created you?
Kill him off.
Yeah, those who don't obey their masters... die!
You really deleted him!
So what?
I'll make a better one.
W-What do you want?
Cut it out!
Though the voyage must continue on
May seas always be calm
When the cycle of the moon has renewed may it shine
It's light to guide your boat
I offer this voyage a prayer
With each new day that still awaits
On vividly shining seas
To the end of the journey
Hmm... in the next episode...
I can't do it.
What now, Chad?
After all that?
On no... the time!
Until now, I hadn't realized.
No...
I may not have wanted to realize.
When I came to Hueco Mundo,
I felt my powers stir inside me.
That's something that... when I entered Soul Society...
I never felt.
That stirring continued to grow gradually even while I was coming here... and then... when I had your attacks showered over me... for the first time, I felt that stirring regain its tranquility.
I thought... that perhaps that stirring might have been the stirring of joy.
That perhaps having come to Hueco Mundo, my power... stirred in joy as if having returned home... and thanks to the rough welcome of its brethren... regained its self.
Ever since I obtained this power,
I have been wondering.
My power is different from both that of a shinigami, and that of a Quincy.
Then, what am I?
That answer has finally found me.
What I call my power... rather than being a shinigami's or Quincy's... seems to be closer to a hollow's.
"Brazo Derecha de Gigante".
This is... the true form of my right arm.
And... its true power.
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky

The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently...

Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate, life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
Good... morning, Ichigo!
You've got some nerve!
Trying to attack your own son in his sleep!
You're pretty good, my boy.
There's nothing more to teach you.
Huh?
!
Hey, what about Karin and Yuzu's injuries?
Injuries?
What're you talking about?
What?
It's a miracle.
A truck crashes into our house, and no one's hurt.
What's more miraculous is that no one woke up.
- What's going on?
Their wounds...
- And the culprit gone away.
- They're all gone.
- Not to worry!
- He'll probably come to apologize later.
- Everyone thinks it was some truck.
As if!
Is this the work of a Soul Reaper?
Ichigo, hurry and eat breakfast or you'll be late.
Oh yeah...
I wonder if she went back to that place she called the Soul Society.
Orihime, did you bring lunch today?
Yes.
I have taiyaki style ramen with wasabi and honey.
Would you like some, Tatsuki?
Err... no thanks.
It's really good.
Oh, it's Inoue.
Huh?
I'm sorry!
Ichigo, you bumped into her and that's all you can say?
!
Oh, sorry.
Are you all right?
Y-Yes...
Here.
Huh?
!
It's all right.
I-I have voby... bolley... volley...
Hey Orihime!
What's with her?
You have such a mean look.
By the way, why're you so late?
It's already lunchtime.
Well...
I'll explain later.
Ichigo, I heard a truck crashed into your house.
Yeah...
Finished cleaning up?
It's not that easy!
Need help?
Huh?
Err... no.
Chad, you'll end up destroying the place even more.
What's next?
Modern literature.
Oh, are you Kurosaki?
Huh?
I'll be sitting next to you from today.
My name's Kuchiki.
Y-You!
What's wrong, Ichigo?
!
You know each other?
Oh no, this is our first meeting.
Right, Kurosaki?
She's a transfer student, Kuchiki.
Right, Rukia?
Nice to meet you.
Hey you!
Just what the hell are you thinking?
!
My, how scary!
What is the matter?
You're not going to do something to me, are you?
First of all, quit talking like that!
Oh, I think this is pretty good considering I learned it overnight.
Forget it!
So why are you here?
Weren't you going back to that Soul Society or whatever?
Don't be stupid.
Only Soul Reapers can go back there.
Right now, I don't have that ability.
What?
Last night, most of my powers as a Soul Reaper were taken by you.
W-What?
I don't know anything about that.
Thanks to you, I'm stuck in this gigai form.
What's a "gigai"?
It's a temporary body provided for use in emergencies.
Soul Reapers who are drastically weakened inhabit a gigai until their powers return.
That's why my classmates could see you.
Precisely.
And so... until my powers return, you will have to do the work of a Soul Reaper.
What?
It's only natural.
You have the powers of a Soul Reaper.
You don't have the right...
- to refuse.
- I refuse!
What?
I don't ever want to fight such monsters again!
Ridiculous!
You did fine yesterday!
That's because my family was being attacked.
But I'm not about to fight for complete strangers.
Sorry to disappoint you.
I see...
Then it can't be helped.
Hey!
Huh?
Aghh!
My body...
What'd you do to me?
!
Follow me.
Hey, where are we going?
It's around here.
What is?
An order... from the Soul Society.
A Whole spirit who lives in this park will probably be attacked.
Help!
Wait!
What?
!
Why are you going to help him?
Isn't he a complete stranger?
So what?
I can't just stand here when he's being attacked before my very eyes!
Don't be so naive!
Wha--?
!
A Soul Reaper must treat all spirits equally.
Just because they're close by... just because it's convenient...
it doesn't work like that.
Do not help him!
If you intend to help that boy, make up your mind to save all spirits!
You must make the commitment to go anywhere... and even be willing to sacrifice your life!
Are you committed to this, Ichigo?
No!
Who cares about commitment?
!
I saved this boy because I wanted to!
What about you?
What?
You risked your life to save me last night.
Did you think about your duty as a Soul Reaper when you acted?
When you put yourself at risk, it doesn't matter!
At the very least...
I... will be different!
You okay?
Hey kid...
If you don't want another scary experience like that, hurry up and pass over.
That was a fine Konso.
I'm leaving!
Huh?
!
What are you doing?
!
Stop!
W-Where am I?
!
W-What do you intend to do to me?
!
Wandering spirit...
Devour it... that man's soul!
Now!
Hear me God...
Why was I born?
Please summon me back to your side!
Now!
Shut up!
How dare you?
!
I am studying contemporary language!
It doesn't sound contemporary at all!
Besides, how long are you gonna keep following me?
!
Until you agree to do the Soul Reaper's job!
Hah!
Whatever!
Hey!
Inoue?
!
Huh?
Kurosaki!
Did that car just hit you?
Oh... maybe...
Maybe?
And you're okay?
!
Yes, it was just a little bump.
I'm fine...
I really am!
You're fine?
And where's the car?
Huh?
It drove away.
Look, you...!
Oh...
I'm sorry.
Well, as long as you're okay.
Huh?
Kuchiki?
Who the hell are you?
Idiot!
She's in our class!
That's Inoue!
Orihime Inoue!
What?
Oh hello, Inoue!
Oh yes, hello.
Have you been out shopping?
Oh yes!
Dinner!
My leeks, butter, bananas, and bean jam... they're fine, too.
What is she gonna make with that?
How did you get that bruise o your leg?
Huh?
Did I just get it?
Maybe when the car hit me.
That looks bad, it must hurt.
A little.
But I'm fine.
Are you sure?
Umm...
What's the matter, Kuchiki?
You look so serious.
Huh?
It's nothing.
Just take care.
Thank you.
Want me to walk you home?
Oh, no...
I'm fine, really.
See you!
Cripes!
She'd better be careful.
That girl...
Huh?
You mean, Inoue?
Are you good friends?
Not really.
I've never even spoken to her much.
She's close to one of my friends who lives in the neighborhood.
Just...
Just?
Three years ago...
her brother died at our hospital...
What?
He was her only family.
It was a car accident.
Brother!
Brother!
Don't die!
Please don't leave me alone!
I didn't know that she was the girl who was crying that day...
I just found out recently.
How was your spirit energy at that time?
Huh?
Not as strong as it is now.
It's only recently that I've been able to see ghosts and talk to them.
Just as I thought...
What is it anyway?
Nothing.
See you.
Huh?
Hey!
Where're you going?
Home.
Where to?
Are you interested?
Not really.
Then don't ask.
W-Why that...!
Yes!
Oh Tatsuki!
Mom asked me to give this to you.
It's stewed beef with potatoes.
Oh!
Wow!
Home-made stewed beef and potatoes!
This is so delicious!
You eat such weird stuff when you're alone.
You think so?
Absolutely...
I mean, what is this stuff?
Hey Brother...
Have you see my pajamas?
Hey, at least knock!
Boy, you've gotten so mean now that you're in high school!
Have not.
And I don't know where your pajamas are.
That's weird.
My dress is also missing.
But why do you have to ask me about everything?
!
Good night!
An order?
What?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
!
Ichigo!
W-What're you doing there?
!
And those pajamas...!
Save it for later.
We have an order!
Order?
!
It's coming!
W-Wait a minute!
Don't just stand there!
It's coming!
Aim for the head!
Ichigo!
Idiot!
Don't just swing the sword around!
Shut up!
As long as I kill it, right?
!
You're mine!
Not deep enough!
Huh?
!
What--?
!
It got away.
We're going after it.
What's the matter, Ichigo?
I have a question...
What is it?
That thing's face...
It was Inoue's brother.
What?
!
I'll tell you one thing...
Attacking a Hollow from behind and splitting its head in one blow...
That is the essence of exterminating a Hollow.
Do not forget.
What do you mean?
This is to minimize your own injuries... and also so that you never see the identity of the Hollow.
What do you mean "identity of the Hollow"?
You saw it, just now.
All Hollows were once the souls of ordinary humans.
What?
!
You never told me that!
Wasn't that just some monster?
!
Some monster we needed to kill?
!
Yes, now he is just a monster.
And he must be destroyed.
But... he was once human?
Grudges, regrets...
Souls who still harbor such feelings are hard to perform Konso on, and linger on alone.
Then they either become Hollows themselves, or are devoured by other Hollows, and become new Hollows.
That's...!
What?
You mean, Ichigo?
!
Yes.
But they were just walking together.
What's the matter?
Why that Ichigo!
I didn't realize he was such a fast worker...!
I mean...
He didn't even walk you home even though you were hurt!
No, he offered to walk me home.
But...
Aghh!
Watch out!
I'm going to win!
I mean, Champ!
What are you imagining?
To the right!
Yes, here!
Watch out!
It's a gun!
What was that?
Though the voyage must continue on
May seas always be calm
When the cycle of the moon has renewed may it shine
It's light to guide your boat
I offer this voyage a prayer
With each new day that still awaits
On vividly shining seas
To the end of the journey
I am the charismatic seer of the new century!
The messenger from the Netherworld, Don Koji!
I journey everywhere in search of bad spirits!
It's not your cue yet!
We're out of time, again!
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently...
until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate, life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
A Menos appeared...
and he defeated it.
This news will eventually reach the Soul Society.
Ichigo...
KUROSAKI CLINIC
Ichigo!
What's the big idea so early in the morning?
You had a realization or something?
Shut up!
It's what your sister did!
A washing was enough, but she went and!
Looks good on you.
Yuzu must've felt sorry 'cuz you were so dirty.
Shut up!
She even put this ornament on my ear!
And she used super glue!
It won't come off!
Let's see...
Cripes!
She thinks I'm just a stuffed toy and...
Owwee!
Hey!
What're you doing?
!
Owwee!
I thought it'd come off if I pulled hard enough.
N-No!
No good.
I think your ear'll come off first.
Why you...!
Look at the time!
I'd better hurry!
Breakfast!
Breakfast!
D Damn it...
Why am I the only one who's always treated like this?
!
Am I not a comrade?
!
Am I not an equal?
Well then, I'll leave on a journey.
And I'll find the one...
who will be kind to me!
The place where I truly belong!
Hey Rukia, time to leave for school!
Huh?
Hey Rukia!
Pipe down!
I can hear you fine.
Huh?
Something happen?
It's nothing.
I'm just tired from yesterday's incident.
If that's all...
I'm going ahead.
What's with her?
So I stormed out of the house.
But I wonder...
I have no money, so I can't go that far.
Huh?
What's that?
Pick me up!
You're Ichigo's classmates!
Girls can't resist picking up a cute stuffed animal.
Yes!
Perfect!
Oh what a... cute stuffed animal...
- Dirty stuffed animal.
- Oof!
- Eh?
- Huh?
S Shucks...
They're staring... at me.
It just spoke, didn't it?
Yes, it did.
I guess it can't be helped in a case like this...
It's running away!
Ryo Kunieda, Karakura High School Track Team.
I run the 100 meters in 12 seconds flat!
You won't outrun me!
No!
Why?
!
All I wanted was some kindness!
In short...
Huh?
Kuchiki!
Good morning!
Good morning, Inoue.
Let's walk together.
Of course, with pleasure.
But you really come early, don't you?
Of course.
It's almost summer vacation, right?
I kept thinking about it and can't sleep, like, sparkle!
I see!
Oh yes!
Kuchiki, do you have any plans for the summer?
Not really.
There's a huge Fireworks Festival in August.
Tatsuki and the others, we're all planning to go together.
Won't you join us?
A Fireworks Festival?
Yes!
We should ask Kurosaki, too.
It'll be like the time we all went to the Burarei program.
I just know it'll be fun.
That was some event, huh?
Uh-huh...
But he came along just for his family, he can be very kind.
He has such a fun family, he should lighten up a bit more.
Kurosaki has a permanent frown on his face.
I thought you didn't care too much for Kurosaki.
Not really.
When you take a good look at him, he has an interesting face.
Please come to the Fireworks Festival with us.
I'll think about it.
Okay come on, Tatsuki!
I found you, my goddess Orihime...
- Earlier was just a rehearsal.
- Go, Orihime!
Hang in there!
- Hime!
You look great!
- The real thing starts now.
First, I'll lie there helpless in front of Orihime.
Like the Holy Mother, she is sure to hold me gently,
- So cute!
- And cuddle me in the Valley of the Gods!
Yes!
My target has always been Orihime!
Her and only her!
Once decided, you must act quickly!
And then, soft, warm cuddles await...
Sure Kill!
Dragon Bazooka!
A perfect ball!
This isn't supposed to happen!
I did it!
A one-run lead!
Yakka = soccer and baseball Orihime, I think your game of "Yakka" isn't fair to the defense.
And a one-run lead isn't cause for a celebration yet!
Huh?
Really?
Let's call it a day.
Free period's over anyway.
- I was just getting warmed up!
- What're they doing anyway?
Ichigo!
What're you looking at?
Hey hey hey!
You were looking at Inoue, weren't you?
Sheesh... talk about well-shaped jugs!
Get offa me!
And quit babbling nonsense!
What?
!
We're healthy high school boys!
What's wrong with being interested in cute girls?
!
All right already!
There's nothing wrong with that.
Huh?
I get it!
You prefer...
The Mizuiro type, huh?
!
Both of you!
Quit fooling around and start helping over here!
Oh sorry!
There!
That's the last of it.
Yes, thanks.
By the way...
Ishida hasn't come by yet today.
I saw him yesterday.
At Central Park, mumbling to himself.
And sounding so dramatic, too!
- He always acts like he's in a drama.
- This guy was nearby?
- Well, that's true, but...
- Close call!
I'll bet he's in some theater group.
There were some weird men around him, too.
And there was even an explosion...
it was pretty wild.
God, thank you for making him such an idiot!
Ishida!
What happened to those injuries?
I fell... from the stairway.
Yeah.
Like, for real.
Hmm... well anyway, take your seat, and let's continue class.
- Really?
Is it okay?
- Sure?
Don't let it bother you.
It's not your fault.
He brought it upon himself.
L-I wouldn't worry about injuries like that.
Really?
Who said not to worry?
I said don't let it bother you.
Why you...!
Was it a fight?
Ishida?
No way!
I can't believe that Ishida was that late...
Third period!
Keep it quiet.
Ichigo!
Let's have lunch together!
Sure, but can I invite someone else, too?
What?
A new girl?
Who?
Ishida...
Let's eat lunch together.
What?
!
W-Why Ishida?
!
Eating with a guy like that can't be fun at all!
I get it!
It must be the bandages!
Were those bandages that funny, Ichigo?
!
Shut up.
- No thanks!
- So blunt!
C'mon.
It's Keigo's treat.
Why?
!
Then fine.
Stingy bastard!
I've been suspecting from the very beginning.
There's probably not much time left.
Oh, there she is!
Rukia, come and join us for lunch!
Jinta, get serious and sweep properly.
Shut up!
This is the age when men are silent and play soccer!
Goodness...
Huh?
!
Tessai...
Kisuke...
A kitty.
Oh!
If it isn't Yoruichi!
Welcome back!
Here you go!
Upsy daisy!
What is that cat?
Its name is Yoruichi and it's the Boss's best friend.
- Huh?
A cat as a best friend?
- Once more?
- I feel sorry for the Boss sometimes.
- Here!
Up and up!
- I guess you could say that.
- Upsy daisy!
T This is such a painful lunch!
It's like we're cursed.
What's the matter?
Oh, it's only you, Chad.
Why are you so scared?
Shut up!
Just leave me alone!
Hey Keigo, say something to cheer us up.
Wha...?
!
T That's impossible!
Hurry it up.
If you're gonna get so moody, you shouldn't have asked Ishida!
Say, I ate saury in Meguro recently.
And the waiter...
- Kurosaki, why'd you invite me?
- I swear...
- Out of sympathy for these wounds?
- He looked like a comedian.
If that's the case, it's misplaced.
And I don't care to be pitied.
Shut up!
I just felt like it... that's all.
I didn't ask you because I like you.
So just be grateful I asked at all.
As if I'd be grateful!
Besides, I prefer to eat alone.
I like to be alone when I eat, too.
Well the...
Just look the other way.
- Why should I be the one to look away?
- These two...
They're so alike.
All together now!
Tadah!
Today's lunch is Castella sandwich!
Castella sponge cake with bean jelly is the ultimate for sweets lovers.
Not again...
Orihime, how come she can eat such things and not gain weight?
All the nutrients are going to her breasts, that's why.
Kuchiki, do you like Kurosaki?
What?
Or, to put it bluntly...
Just what is your relationship with Kurosaki?
Well, we're frie...
Mahana, that was way too bold!
Why?
You're the ones who want to know, but can't ask.
So I popped the question for you.
Err...
Well...
I'm not that interested...
Maybe, not you...
You don't care for Ichigo anyway, Michiru.
Well, it's not that I don't like him.
His face just looks a bit scary.
Really?
I think he has an interesting face.
Huh?
When did you get over your fear of Kurosaki?
Well?
What's the story?
Kurosaki is...
Kurosaki is just a friend.
- Are you serious?
- Yes.
You don't feel anything for him?
Not at all?
Not at all.
To bad!
If you like Kurosaki, then I'd have to start liking him... and Tatsuki can start liking him... and why don't we all start liking him?
Then it would have been a sure win for the girl's team!
This kid is starting her nonsensical rambling again!
A group competition from the start sounds interesting.
But I want Orihime's first happy face to be all mine!
And so...
Let's begin with a one-on-one relationship!
Come on, Orihime!
Stop it!
Ughh...
That was a nice parry...
That wasn't a parry, it was a punch!
I know!
I'll come up... with a new concoction with bean jam...
So let's eat it together, all right?
Err...
I'll think about it.
Not the same answer again!
You keep saying, "I'll think about it."
Oh really?
I don't...
I don't belong here.
URAHARA STORE
Why do I have to be treated like this?
!
Damn!
This is all Ichigo's fault!
You just wait, Ichigo!
I'll use the deadly weapons that weird manager has collected here and get my revenge!
Huh?
!
Who are you?
!
Wanna fight?
!
Just because you're also one of the cat family, don't put me in the same class as you!
I'm a lion!
Hah!
Scared ya, huh?
Good riddance!
That was easy!
Hmm...
Mod Souls can even enter stuffed toys.
Hello!
W-What the...!
Yoroichi told us.
You're the cat from earlier!
- Now then...
What'll we do with you?
- Hey, you two!
- Hey Ururu, grab his feet!
- What's the big idea?
!
'Kay.
- One and two and!
- Hey!
Cut it out!
Noooooooooooo!
Ichigo!
Huh?
What is it?
A Hollow?
No, it's not that.
Are you feeling all right?
Huh?
Yeah, there's nothing wrong with me.
I see...
Then that's good.
Is there gonna be another one like yesterday?
What would we do if a Menos Grande appeared so easily?
You're... acting a bit strange today.
Did something happen?
Well...
- It's!
- Huh?
Ichigo!
Sorry I ran away!
I understand now!
I realize that my place is with you!
Ichigo!
You ran away?
Hey you...
I'm over here!
Ohhh!
The world was so cruel to this one who ran away from home.
I'm...
I'm going back to your room!
Going back, huh?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
But he's really become attached to you.
He's a pain in the neck.
But look at you!
Look, you have stuffing coming out.
- Hey!
What're you doing?
!
- I'm amazed he didn't die.
- Oh well, we'll take you to him.
- Let go of me!
HANDICRAFT CLUB
Why me?
Why not?
I thought this is your specialty.
I refuse.
Why?
I don't need to answer that.
So selfish!
Oh I got it!
Can't do a thing with those hands!
Yeah, it's impossible.
Yeah...
Can't even thread a needle like that, huh?
How insulting!
These wounds are nothing!
Give it here!
And just watch me!
The work of a master!
Oh no...
- This is a piece of cake for me!
- What's this?
Is it all right?
- I dunno...
- What's happening to me?
Finished!
This is!
Unbelievable!
Huh?
!
Who are you?
!
He's been powered up.
Such bad taste.
Pretty bad.
What is this?
!
I have high-grade fabric so that I can accept orders at any time.
And the material I used here...
Shut up!
Just cut the crap!
Making fun of me and...
Huh?
!
Huh?
!
I'm going to run away, after all!
What's the matter, Yoruichi?
Is it going to rain?
Stop putting on an act, Kisuke.
You know, don't you?
Those guys are here.
Will you talk about it before or after your milk?
Hey Rukia!
It's dinnertime...
Huh?
Geez, she went off somewhere again.
Thanks for everything.
Rukia
Rear conformity 113!
Neural coefficient 88.5%.
Is this for real?
She's actual in a Gigai...
I didn't think the data from the Visuals Department was reliable.
Rukia Kuchiki...
Found you!
With much appreciation
I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
I'll always be grateful for who you are.
I was casually walking through town
Around the time dusk fell and the city was bathed in red
It was an afternoon with crowds of people coming and going
I don't know why but I just stood there and watched
Then my cell phone started to vibrate and I made myself move hoping it could fill in this hole in my heart
You're not alone You see, everybody
We gotta hold each other up
With much appreciation
I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
I'll always be grateful for who you are.
I'm Ishida, president of the Handicrafts Club.
I just want to say one thing... this episode did not showcase all of my talent.
If I had more time, I could've come up with a more fashionable look.
In time, I'll show you my work that will make your spine tingle.
Just you wait.
Noooo!
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently...
Until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate, life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
Huh...!
Hey...
Hey!
What time is it?
!
This is bad, Big Brother!
It's nine already!
N-No!
Come on!
Bonnie!
Hah!
Good girl, Bonnie!
But we don't have time today!
Hurry and let me ride you!
Hold it!
You're running away?
!
Who's running away?
!
Hey Dandelion!
We'll settle this for sure tomorrow!
So you just wait there until then!
Now don't you go floating away like cotton!
Let's go, everyone!
Huh?
!
Cut the crap!
That's my!
They're gone.
That was a disaster...
I'm speechless.
Dammit!
Just who the hell is he?
!
I wonder if Jidanbo is all right?
The wound has closed up, but...
Big-bodied men have lots of stamina.
I'm sure he'll be okay.
You're right.
He's so big and so strong.
I'm sure he'll be okay.
Still...
Who is this Kukaku Shiba we're going to meet now?
Yoruichi never gives us any details...
It's probably someone he knows who can get us to Seireitei without passing through the gates, right?
Probably, someone who is famous for his skill.
Oh!
It must be a cat with pedigree papers!
Like a Persian cat...
Or an American Short Hair...
Or a Dalmatian.
Inoue...
It doesn't mean it'll be a cat just because Yoruichi knows him.
Also...a Dalmatian...
Is a dog!
A dog?
Judging from the name, he's probably a well built man, someone like a samurai.
No, he'll be an old hermit-type master.
I know!
See?
Like this and this and...
Done!
A hermit like macho samurai with cat ears, and a tail!
No doubt about it!
I can't tell what you drew...
Oh?
Then how about a skinny guitar wielding samurai?
You don't understand, Inoue.
He has to have a cape.
Oh shucks!
But Kurosaki is late.
Shall I call him?
No, I'll go see.
Now then, I have to think up the next Kukaku Shiba!
No... you don't have to think.
Huh?
What?
!
Not going?
!
Not "not going." Just go on ahead.
I'm going to finish the fight with that guy from yesterday!
What are you saying?
!
Quit joking around...and come!
No!
No!
He'll think I ran away!
So what?
!
Hey, hey...
Aren't we going yet?
Inoue!
Help me drag this fool away from here!
W-Who's the fool?
!
I'm gonna beat him up quickly as soon as he shows up, and I'll come after you, so go on!
Has blood gone to your head and made you forget your purpose here?
Fool!
Rukia's life depends on this journey.
Surely, you haven't forgotten.
You can't waste time just to see who's more stubborn!
If you understand, get ready!
What is it...
Renji?
Did they move up my execution date?
It's less than 14 days to the execution.
The use of Sokyoku has been granted.
You're being transferred to Shishinro, Repentance Cell.
Hey...
Looks like we've come to the edge of a village.
Are you sure this is the right way?
Hey!
Shut up!
According to the map the Elder gave us, it's supposed to be around here.
If you have any complaints, you take the lead!
No, I'm not complaining.
Kukaku Shiba probably wants to keep his identity a secret, that's why he lives in a place like this.
Unfortunately, that is not the case.
It's just that person's nature...
And personal preference.
Don't worry.
This person moves around quite a bit, but the house is always built the same.
Once you see it, you'll recognize it.
Once you see it, huh?
Yes, yes.
Just once...
Oh, I see it!
There it is.
- Wha!
- What's this?
!
Wow!
How neat!
Kukaku Shiba
See?
You can recognize it at once.
That's not the problem anymore!
Wants to keep his identity a secret?
That's probably a lie!
He's probably not allowed to live in town because he builds houses like that!
That's gotta be it!
Hmm...
So this time, it's human arms holding the banner.
It's pretty neatly done.
- Each time...
- He changes the motif?
Let's go.
Okay!
Argh...we're going to that embarrassing house right now?
!
I don't want to be seen walking into a house like that!
What's the matter?
Hurry up!
- Yes.
- Yes.
Hey Ishida!
I know you don't want to go, but hurry up!
What's that supposed to mean?
What's that chimney?
It's awfully big compared to the house.
It looks like the opening is closed up.
What the...?
Hold it!
Huh?
Who goes there?
!
Strangers!
And one is a Soul Reaper!
Suspicious characters!
- I, Koganehiko...
- And Shiroganehiko...
- Will not allow you to pass!
- Will not allow you to pass!
Be gone!
Or you'll die right here!
Damn!
Not gatekeepers again?
!
What a pain this Soul Society is!
-Huh?
-Huh?
Master Yoruichi!
A descending stairway as soon as you enter?
This house really is weird.
I wonder how you get upstairs?
Please pardon us!
We did not know it was you, Yoruichi, and your companions.
Please forgive our rudeness.
We're not his companions.
That's all right.
It's my fault for not notifying you beforehand.
Thank you!
Such generous words from such a great personage!
Please wait here a moment.
Y-Yes!
Yes, right away...
Master Kukaku!
It's been a while, Yoruichi.
K-Kukaku is...
- A woman?
!
- A woman?
!
I never said it was a man.
Huh?
Who are those kids?
Actually, Kukaku...
I have a favor to ask of you.
That's usually the case when you look me up.
Is it a difficult problem?
Most likely.
It's been a long time since we've talked like this...
All right.
Tell me, I love difficult things.
Can you see it, Rukia?
From that window over there?
The two tools which will be used for your execution.
That is the Sokyoku.
A prisoner who is held in this tower can look out the window that has been placed in the tower, and gaze out at the Sokyoku and repent his sins.
That is why this is called the Repentance Cell.
Your hands...
Release!
Thank you for transferring the prisoner here.
Let us go.
Yes.
Lieutenant Abarai...
Huh?
Lieutenant!
Here is unconfirmed information:
You already heard that there were Ryoka in Soul Society yesterday?
Five of them...
And one of them wielded a sword as long as his body.
A Soul Reaper with orange colored hair.
Huh?
!
I see...
I get the picture.
All right, I'll take on the job.
Really?
Yeah.
If Urahara is involved, I can't refuse even if I wanted to.
However, while I trust you...
I don't trust those kids.
I'll include my henchman to keep an eye on them.
Henchman?
Yeah.
Henchman, but he's actually my kid brother.
He's still a brat and not that useful.
Hey, are you ready?
Oh...just a minute.
I'm opening the door, so behave!
Y-Yeah!
How do you do?
!
My name is Ganju Shiba!
Please be good to me!
What?
You know each other?
How many days has it been since I saw her face looking so alive?
Ichimaru was the one who confronted them, so that kid probably isn't alive.
I...
I was probably right not to tell her.
-Hey!
-Huh?
Hey, it's been awhile, Abarai.
Aizen-san!
Can you talk?
Well...
It's been quite some time since we talked like this.
Yes.
Since you were sent to Kenpachi's place.
How many years has it been?
You're with the Squad 6 now?
Err...what did you want to talk to me about?
Abarai, you and her...
You were close to Rukia Kuchiki, right?
Don't deny it.
I heard you were chums from the old days in Rukon District.
Yes...
I won't waste any time then.
In your eyes, should she die?
No...
I don't understand your question.
Don't you think it's strange?
Her crime was the unauthorized transfer, and loss, of her spiritual energy, and staying longer than allowed outside.
Certainly, heavy crimes, but the problem is how to deal with them.
The order for immediate return and disposal of her Gigai.
The lessening of the grace period from 35 days to 25 days, and the use of the Sokyoku on one who is ranked below a captain.
They're all outside the norm.
I have a feeling that this is the will of one person.
Hold it, Captain.
What do you mean?
!
I have a bad feeling.
Abarai, I may...
Attention all captains!
Attention all captains!
An urgent meeting will now be held!
Repeat!
Why you!
Hah!
Serves you right!
- Lucky!
- What ?
!
Why you!
-How's that?
!
-Now I'm mad!
You bastard!
Why you!
Did she have to go that far to stop them?
I think I know why she always moves.
It must be hard.
What's with you?
!
Fighting from the minute you set eyes on each other...
Don't you know it's dangerous?
!
You destroyed my house!
Hey!
-But Sis...
-No excuses!
Any complaints?
!
-Err...no!
-No!
What's with this?
Both brother and sister...
Huh?
!
Hey brat!
This is my house!
If you have a problem about the way I do things, get outta here!
I-I'm sorry.
Okay.
As long as you understand.
Your sister is something else.
I know.
All right.
Everyone, stand!
- Yes!
- Yes!
Koganehiko, go outside with Shiroganehiko and start the preparations.
Right!
The rest, be quiet and follow me!
Wow...why is there light when we're underground?
I didn't see any generators.
I keep hotaru kazura in the ceiling cracks and on both sides of the wooden frames.
Hotaru-kazura?
Is that a plant or something that is only found in Soul Society?
We're here.
This is it.
Um...
Open it, Ganju.
Right!
Umm...!
What's the big idea?
!
Don't defy her!
Okay?
Heave!
W-What is this?
!
It's huge!
I'll shoot you guys into Seireitei with this.
From the sky.
- Sky?
!
- Sky?
!
My name is Kukaku Shiba.
I'm the best pyrotechnic in Rukongai!
With much appreciation send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
I'll always be grateful for who you are.
I was casually walking through town
Around the time dusk fell and the city was bathed in red
It was an afternoon with crowds of people coming and going
I don't know why but I just stood there and watched
Then my cell phone started to vibrate and I made myself move hoping it could fill in this hole in my heart
You're not alone You see, everybody
We gotta hold each other up
With much appreciation
I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
I'll always be grateful for who you are.
This is the Special Hard Spiritual Partition Penetration Device which my sister invented that can break through the barrier which surrounds the entire Seireitei and which is made from the Sekki Seki which breaks down spiritual energy completely.
Oh...
Can you repeat that?
Forget it!
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two. ..
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently...
until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate, life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of Light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
Well, if you'll let me eat you, I'll tell you.
The one who reigns!
Mask of flesh, all creation, flap of wings... the one who carries the title of human!
In the name of truth and temperance, dig your claws into the wall of sinless dreams!
Destruction Spell 33...
Pale Fire Crash!
[ Skipped item nr. 31 ]
Good, at least this much of my powers are back. ..
Huh?
Ridiculous!
It didn't even scratch him!
Hah!
I know that trick!
It's a Soul Reaper spell, right?
But yours is so weak.
I felt nothing.
Dammit!
As I thought, my Kido hasn't recovered enough to use a spell of that level.
How many years has it been...
since I last saw Karin cry... ?
Until our mom died, Karin was a crybaby, just Like Yuzu.
After she died, Yuzu, who was the clever and responsible one, tried to fill in for our mom, and began to take over the housekeeping.
Karin, who wasn't good at much of anything, stopped crying altogether so as not to worry the rest of us.
Even when she lost a fight with an upperclassman, or when she hit a ball through the window of the principal's office and was reprimanded,
or when she broke her leg while hiking, she never cried once.
Karin...
leavethisto me .
Are you really a Soul Reaper?
Why don't you take off that human form?
Huh?
!
Oh... did I... get him?
Huh... ?
HehitaHollow...?
Can he see spirits... ?
No... maybenot...
What's this...
he just happened to hit me...?
I thought he could see me-
There...
I got 'im...
I-Impossible...
He shouldn't be seeing the Hollow, much less hearing his voice...
He's calmly facing down an enemy he cannot even sense...
Doesn't he have any fear... ?
Damn...
Bet you can't touch me here!
What are you going to do, you good-for-nothing Soul Reaper?
Don't just stand there!
Get away!
He's up in the air!
Transfer student...
You can see ghosts?
Never mind about that!
In any case, at that distance...
- Where is he?
- What?
He's flying isn't he?
In which direction?
What good would knowing that do?
I'd do this...
Now, what shall I do...?
Shall I do a hit-and-run and snatch him like a falcon?
What is this...?
!
Now... where is he...?
Right there!
Swing down right there!
Now, give up.
Someone's on his way to finish you off.
What's so funny?
No wonder you Soul Reapers, the whole bunch of you, are always...
getting beaten by us!
Looks like the shoe's on the other foot.
You Soul Reapers take us too lightly.
That's why you end up like this.
Now...who shall I start eating...?
I think I'll save the guy for last.
What...?
!
T-This is crazy!
You think you can solve all your problems with muscle?
You muscle-headed idiot?
!
Ugh...
This one's got such sharp instincts...!
This way, Chad!
Kick the air above me!
Damn!
No!
Not there!
Up above!
In the sky?
!
I have an idea!
Transfer student...
Will this really work?
Yes.
We'll utilize your strength and my brains.
What can I say...?
This don't seem smart at all.
I don't have to take that from you!
Let's go!
In the direction of the tiger!
Which way is the tiger?
Humph!
Left!
Left...
You fool!
That's too high?
Okay, here we go.
If I'm this far up in the air, no electric pole will reach me.
Fire!
Give up!
O-Okay...!
I-I give up...!
Just kidding!
W-What happened?
S-Sorry about that.
He caught me by surprise.
Damn...!
What in the world are these...
leeches?
!
Exactly!
They won't come off easily...
Besides, they're my targets!
Transfer student...!
?
W-What happened?
Are you surprised?
!
Those leeches are small bombs.
They respond to sounds from my tongue, and explode!
Your guard was wide open.
You wanna take me on, you lummox?
But you...
Oh!
I get it...
He ran off a while ago to gain some time to bring this here...?
!
I'm sorry, Mister...
He caught me...
Shibata...
Looks like you understand now, big boy.
Now, it's time for us to play, Soul Reaper!
Now run!
Let me enjoy hunting you down!
Don't move from here, Chad...
If you take even a step, he plans to blow up that birdcage.
Transfer student, what about you?
You needn't worry about me!
I gave my word... not to foul up!
Your word?
This is getting fun...!
You're covered with them!
How nice... to see you covered in blood.
You're so pretty...!
I can hardly... wait!
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
How long do you intend to keep running?
You can turn around and attack me, if you like!
Well?
!
Soul Reaper!
Huh?
What is it...?
Have you given up already?
That's no fun.
Come on, run, will you?
I haven't given up...
I have no need to run anymore.
What...?
You said that I could attack you, didn't you?
In that case, I will take you at your word.
In that case, I will take you at your word.
Right...
Ichigo...?
What do you mean, "Right, Ichigo"?
Didn't you promise to not worry me by fouling up?
Fool!
That's a line for someone who's even a little bit worried, to say.
I guess you're right.
Damn you...!
How long do you intend to sit on my head!
Ichigo Kurosaki, 15 years old!
Currently a surrogate Soul Reaper!
If you want to chase someone, aren't you running after the wrong person?
Surrogate Soul Reaper...?
Damn!
If that's so...
I should have... gone after you from the start!
Ichigo!
You slowpoke!
You look the tastiest...
I see.
So you used those bombs to pin Chad down so you could enjoy attacking a girl?
You're nothing but a stinking pig!
But now you're gonna be eaten by that stinking pig.
I-Ichigo?
!
What's wrong, Ichigo?
Chad!
Perfect timing.
Go and hide him and the parakeet somewhere safe.
Transfer student...
What is this...?
Don't worry.
He's now... in the middle of a battle!
Good move.
But remember, the leeches, that flowed out of their bodies... are also bombs!
There's something I want to ask you.
Are you the one who killed the parents... of the kid inside the parakeet?
What?
He said it's all my fault.
Because of me, the man and the girl got hurt.
Shibata...
It's all because I wanted to bring my mom back to life.
I'm sorry...
I want my mom to come back to life.
But...
Wait!
Did someone tell you... that he would bring your mother back to life?
Did someone tell you there was a way to do that?
That's right.
I'm the one who killed that kid's mother - while I was still alive.
At the time, I was a serial killer.
It was all over TV -
I was famous.
That kid's mother was my last victim.
It was so much fun...
She ran as hard as she could.
She barely had any breath left, but she still tried to protect her kid.
It was such a thrill.
But that's where it went wrong.
I chased her out onto her veranda...
That kid!
He grabbed my shoe laces...
Who woulda thought I'd get killed by a slip up like that...?
I decided to pay that kid back.
I put the soul of the boy, who survived, into the parakeet, and I told him this:
Three months!
If you can run around in that form for that long,
I would bring his mother back to life.
Bring her back to life...?
Fool!
Of course, I couldn't do that- bring a dead person back to life!
But that kid believed me.
He ran as hard as he could.
What's fun about this penalty game is that
I could kill off any and everyone who tried to protect the kid.
And each time, the kid would whine and beg to quit.
He didn't like it, he said.
That's when I used my clincher...
"Your mother is waiting for you to save her!"
Hearing that, he would always regain his will.
He'd cry, "Mom...!
Mom...!"
What are you sympathizing with him for?
!
You dropped your guard!
This is the end for you!
You can have this bomb back.
What's wrong?
You're going to set it off, aren't you?
Come on and click your tongue!
Aren't you going to click your tongue?
In that case...
I'll take your tongue!
Ah, my tongue!
Get lost...!
Wha..?
!
It is Hell...
The Zanpaku-to can only wash away sins committed after death.
For Hollows that committed major sins before their death...
The Gates of the Netherworld will open!
So...he's gone to hell...?
Well...?
It's unfortunate, but... his chain of fate has been severed;
there's no sign of it.
There's no way I can return him to his body.
No...
Shibata...
Don't worry!
Soul Society isn't a scary place!
You'll never get hungry, and your body will fell light.
You'll probably find it a better place than this!
Oh...?
You can say that...
when you're just a hanger-on...?
But, that might be true.
At least, if you go over, you'll be able to see your mom.
Oh!
You can't bring her back to life, but now, you can go to her.
Ichigo...
Mister...
Thank you for everything...
You ran around with me in your arms, so I didn't get hurt at all...
Yes...
You're safe...
Well, I'll be going then.
Thank you very much.
Yuichi...
When I die and pass over... would it be okay if I carried you and ran around again?
Yes!
Now, then...
Shall we get on with the Konso?
Thank you...
Ichigo...
Though the voyage must continue on
May seas always be calm
When the cycle of the moon has renewed may it shine
It's Light to guide your boat
I offer this voyage a prayer
With each new day that still awaits
On vividly shining seas
To the end of the journey
Pardon me for the last time.
I'm Kisuke Urahara, owner of the Urahara Store.
I'm going to do my best to bring you the preview this time.
The Urahara Store got its start when I...
What are you talking about?
!
I told you we don't have much time, didn't I?
!
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently...

Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you

Rukia Kuchiki...
Found you!
Give me that sword, Soul Reaper.
My name is not Soul Reaper.
I am Rukia Kuchiki.
Kuchiki, do you like Kurosaki?
What?
I'll be sitting next to you from today.
My name's Kuchiki.
Y You...!
How do you drink this?
Huh?
You just poke a straw in it and drink.
Bohahahahaha!
Oh no!
I'd better take you to the infirmary!
Okay, I'll believe you...
Idiot!
You think I'd believe that?
!
I'll come up with a new concoction of bean jam.
So let's eat it together.
Err...
I'll think about it.
Not the same answer again!
You keep saying, "I'll think about it."
Oh really?
Here, here!
Is it good?
If I'm going to have to leave this place one day, all this will be a burden.
Compassion, friendship and affection...
Kurosaki is just a friend.
They're a bother.
All these feelings aren't necessary for a Soul Reaper.
It's unbecoming, Rukia Kuchiki.
I think I've stayed in this world for too long.
Yes!
Huh?
!
See, you understand.
Huh?
!
Though, to put it another way, because you stayed in this world so long, you were able to prolong your life a bit more, Rukia!
Renji!
Are you Renji Abarai?
You had an assailant from the Soul Society lurking right behind you, but you were so deep in thought, you didn't even notice until I called out your name?
Granted you're in a Gigai, but in just one or two months, haven't you become a bit too lax?
Spit it out, Rukia.
Where is the human who took all your powers?
What are you saying?
!
Just because I'm in a Gigai doesn't mean I've lost my powers.
Furthermore... to assume that the one who took my powers was a human...
It was a human!
Otherwise, there's no way you would have such a human expression on your face!
You're from the Rukon District like me.
You were taken in by the great noble family of Kuchiki... and they spent a lot of time and money to make you an elite Soul Reaper!
Isn't that so?
!
You are Rukia Kuchiki!
Looking so human...
There's no way that's a good thing!
Right, Captain Kuchiki?
Brother...
Byakuya?
Rukia...
Passing on Soul Reaper powers to a human is a grave crime.
Consider it compassion from the higher-ups for letting us handle your execution instead of the Keigun.
Now tell us where he is, Rukia.
We're taking you in, then we'll go after the one who took your powers... and we'll kill him!
Don't even try to protect him.
You realize it, don't you?
You didn't dodge my earlier attacks.
I've let you dodge them.
The next one will be fatal.
Take that!
Now!
An unarmed girl being attacked by two men with weapons?
It's not... a very pleasant sight.
I don't really go for that kind of thing.
You can see us?
Just who are you?
Just a classmate.
Classmate?
One who hates Soul Reapers.
Ishida...?
What are you doing here?
Sheer coincidence.
Nothing for you to worry about.
But if you must know...
I had a sudden urge to go to Sunflower Sewing, the sewing shop franchise that's open 24 hours...
And that's why I was walking here so late.
It's not as though I sensed the presence of Soul Reapers and came here to look, taking the trouble of carrying this plastic bag just so I could use it as an excuse.
Oh my...
I didn't know he was so clueless.
Well, I don't blame you for being shocked, but...
I asked you a question.
Just who are you?
Well, don't answer if you don't want to.
I'll just kill you first.
Wait, Renji!
He has nothing to do with this!
What are you saying?
I did answer you.
I'm just Rukia Kuchiki's classmate...
one who hates Soul Reapers.
That's not an answer!
I'm Uryu Ishida.
Pleased to meet you.
What's this change of attitude?
You may be a Soul Reaper... but you'd still want to know the name of your killer, right?
It's decided!
I'm going to kill you!
I wonder if Rukia doesn't intend to come back?
It's past two in the morning!
Oh well, I guess I get a break from Soul Reaper duties tonight...
Huh?
What the...?
!
Where's it coming from?
Is it from here?
!
You!
Kon!
What're you doing down there?
!
Didn't you go on a journey?
Oh boy...
Thanks for saving me!
Don't mention it.
In that position I couldn't see who came in... so I had to listen and try to figure out if it was you.
W-What're you doing?
!
Is this what you do to friends who had to endure such suffering for so long?
!
Shut up!
What friend?
!
You Stink!
That's not my fault...
Sis...
Oh that's right!
Ichigo!
Sis is in trouble!
Look!
Don't come near me!
Huh?
!
Look at this!
Don't tell me you didn't notice this all this time?
!
What is it?
Isn't it obvious?
!
It's a farewell letter.
Farewell letter?
Then why were you in the toilet instead of leaving?
Sheesh!
It wasn't me that wrote it!
KUROSAKI CLINIC After that incident, I went back to say goodbye to Sis before leaving on my journey.
Mind you, I didn't go back with my tail between my legs.
But it was the honorable thing to do.
So I went for a quick stop.
Sis?
Sis?
Sis left us all and went away.
Why?
!
Without telling me?
Shut up!
Shut up!
How should I know?
!
I was there with her!
And yet, she left without a word to me!
Who cares about you?
!
- Sis!
- Damn that Rukia!
What's she thinking anyway?
!
Huh?
!
"Enjoy decoding."
BFor bcerbtain breabsons..."
"BI bmust bleave." What the hell?
!
"This is the hint." What's it mean?
Geez!
Too many "b" consonants!
So this must be a badger!
If we badger the "b's"...
Let's see...
"For certain reasons...
"I must leave.
"Do not look for me and...
"do not worry.
"Burn this letter when you've read it.
And...
"Keep yourself hidden for a while."
What's it all mean?
She doesn't explain her reason for leaving.
Don't you understand?
Huh?
Something must've happened.
Burn the letter... stay hidden...
Why is Sis so worried about us?
Isn't it obvious?
!
Something happened between her and the Soul Society!
And so that she doesn't involve us...
Sis...
Sis left all by herself!
Sis... what if... she's dea...
Cut it out!
Let's stop jumping to conclusions.
All this talking...
It isn't getting us anywhere.
Ichigo...
Let's go, Kon.
I'm going to transform into a Soul Reaper and go after Rukia!
Right!
I'm with you!
Huh?
N-Not again?
!
There's no other way except to stick my hand into your mouth for the Gikongan!
No!
No!
Stop!
No!
No!
Hold it!
No!
Quit resisting!
Rukia's in danger!
I can't do a thing unless I turn into a Soul Reaper!
Arghh...
That's not the point who likes to have a hand rammed down his throat?
!
Stupid!
This is just as disgusting to me, too!
Hello!
Seems like you're in a bind.
Is there something I can help you with?
See?
That's why you shouldn't talk big.
He's so strong...
He's increased his skills even more.
I couldn't stop him...
let alone move from this spot.
Now then...
Let's go with the final blow.
Remember this before you die!
Renji Abarai... is the name of the man who killed you.
Wait!
Nice to meet you!
Wha...?
!
Who are you?
!
Ichigo Kurosaki.
The one who will beat you.
Nice to meet you.
Wearing Shihakusho?
Which squad are you from?
!
W-What's with that outsized Zanpaku-to?
!
Oh?
So it's big, after all?
I did think that it was big compared to Rukia's.
But well...
Haven't had anything else to compare it to.
The size of one's Zanpaku-to mirrors the size of one's spiritual energy.
A kid this young with a sword this size?
!
Is he for real?
Ichigo, you fool!
Why did you come?
!
I see.
I get it now.
You're the human who took Rukia's power, huh?
!
Huh?
!
Take this and that and that!
What's the matter?
Is that sword just for show?
Huh?
!
Damn you!
What the hell's the matter with him?
!
Ichigo!
Don't go...
Ishida...
It's over, huh?
You'll die and Rukia will get her powers back.
And, Rukia will die in Soul Society.
Huh?
!
But what an idiot you are!
Rukia came here all alone...
Just so that she wouldn't involve you.
You should've just stayed put at home, but you came after her.
Did you think you could do something?
You, a Soul Reaper by accident?
You can't hurt real Soul Reapers like us...
not even a scratch.
Sorry about that.
I know you were talking, but you were so wide open,
I couldn't help myself.
But why don't you continue?
Not even a scratch, you said?
Why you...!
You were off your guard, Renji.
Captain Kuchiki!
That boy, Ichigo Kurosaki...
I thought I had seen him somewhere.
I got a report the other day from the Secret Remote Squad.
He injured the Menos Grande quite seriously and forced it to return to Hueco Mundo.
Huh?
What a laugh!
The quality of the Secret Remote Squad has really deteriorated lately.
This kid?
Wounded a Menos Grande?
Who'd believe such a story?
!
I mean, Captain, take a look!
At his Zanpaku-to!
It's just big and pitifully useless!
It's obvious he hasn't mastered his spiritual energy.
What's the name of your Zanpaku-to?
Huh?
Name?
Did you ask?
You mean, ask Rukia?
So you name every one of your swords?
I knew it.
You don't even know your Zanpaku-to's name.
And you think you can fight me as an equal?
Well, it's 2000 years too soon!
Roar!
Zabimaru!
Look in front of you!
What stands before you is... your prey!
It's all over, punk.
You will lose to Renji Abarai...
and die at this spot!
With much appreciation
I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
I'll always be grateful for who you are.
I was casually walking through town
Around the time dusk fell and the city was bathed in red
It was an afternoon with crowds of people coming and going
I don't know why but I just stood there and watched
Then my cell phone started to vibrate and I made myself move hoping it could fill in this hole in my heart
You're not alone You see, everybody
We gotta hold each other up
With much appreciation
I send a rhapsody filled with treasured thoughts
To the people who have always held me up.
Thank you for everything
Thank you so much
Wherever I may be
I'll always be grateful for who you are.
It's Kon Bleach Quick Facts!
Soul Reapers in the Soul Society belong to Thirteen Court Guard Squads.
Byakuya Kuchiki is the captain of the Squad 6.
Renji Abarai is the vice-captain.
And...
Which program are you imitating?
Do the preview!
now go ahead and explain the rules of this match.
Let's use this.
What's that?
It's anti-Hollow bait.
Hollows will gather.
What?
!
The one who beats the most Hollows in 24 hours is the winner.
How about it?
right?
Screw you!
You want to put the townspeople in danger just for our match?
!
Who the hell do you think you are?
!
you pompous bastard.
You don't have to worry about the other people.
I'll destroy every last Hollow that shows up. then you should be able to accept this challenge.
One down.
Kurosaki Ichigo.
Undo it!
Send the Hollows back!
Soon this town will be buried in Hollows lured by the bait.
as it were.
Isn't there something else you should be doing instead of attacking me?
that is.
You bastard...
Have you forgotten?
Hollows have a tendency to prefer attacking humans with high spiritual power.
Yuzu!
Karin!
Dammit!
Ichigo!
So you haven't realized after all.
your family aren't the only ones with high spiritual power.
Don't worry.
I'll defeat them all. here on the banks of the Rubicon.
I hate Shinigami.
It's true.
Mikarin.
Yoshirin?
Of course.
After all...
What?
someone might see us.
Jesus...
It's too friggin' early for petting!
Damn ghosts... no one's watching.
Mikarin!
Yoshirin!
Hey Arisawa!
Break's over!
Arisawa!
Got it!
Tatsuki-chan.
Orihime?
Got a... minute? the day I went to hang out at Orihime's place...
I have almost no memories from that day. that it was extremely painful and that I thought I saw someone resembling Kuchiki-san.
but... I have started to see strange things.
Tatsuki-chan.
Tatsuki-chan.
Hi there.
Eye.
Eye.
And how do you like my butt?
quit bugging me!
Tatsuki-chan?
!
sorry.
What was it?
but... what was that?
A first floor window just shattered!
Anyone hurt?
I wonder what happened.
Orihime.
Y-Yeah.
hurry up and kick it!
What the heck?
Third one.
It's that late?
She must've gone to play somewhere.
Where...
Dammit.
Seven.
Eight.
Nine.
Ten.
Eleven.
Urahara?
a Hollow?
At a time like this...
Urahara.
We'll continue later.
disappeared...
Ah.
That Ichigo.
Most impressive.
It disappeared again...
What's going on?
Don't tell me it really is broke.
Again?
I-It's practically i-impossible for Hollows to appear at this rate!
What is... this wildly chaotic spirit pulse?
Just what... is about to happen?
Come on!
Where is she?
Chad!
lunchtime'll be over!
I'll make you pay the difference!
That's a problem.
That's right.
It is a problem.
then come on already!
I've got a bad feeling.
This feeling... is familiar... dammit!
I have to string meals together with just minimum wage!
My life's on the line here!
I'm not a carefree student like you who gets to eat just by being alive!
Sorry.
I risk my life for a bowl of food"!
repeat!
I-I risk my life for a bowl of food.
let's go.
Don't buy eat unless it's a bargain.
Consider expiration dates a suggestion.
r-
What happened?
Was it a gas explosion?
What?
Just that area looks...
Chad.
You okay?
let's get outta here.
Shigeo!
Harutoki!
Run aw-
It's after me?
I see.
In that case... where're you going?
! the deal is simple.
I'll just run to somewhere with no one to get caught in the fray.
Run!
Sorry.
Kurosaki!
What's with you today?
Spacing out and kicking randomly...
You wanna play or what?
!
W-W-What?
You wanna fight?
bring it on.
we'll finally...
I'm gonna call it a day.
wait!
Kurosaki!
Today's a lost cause.
That weird air's been distracting me so I can't concentrate on soccer.
I'm just gonna take an early bath and go to bed.
you're Ichi's friend... the parakeet dude.
Ichigo's sister...
What's a grown up like you doing here by hims-
W-What is that...
What was that?
It stopped moving.
Is it checking us out?
Or maybe... if I could just see it a little more clearly.
It's back.
What is it?
What the heck is that?
You... can see that thing?
Can I see it?
What're you talking about?
I see it TOO clearly.
You... behind you!
It's gone?
Where did it go?
old dude?
!
run away!
don't tell me you can't see that thing?
I can see it a little.
you almost can't see it at all.
No other choice.
Hold on to me.
I'll see it for you.
Wha?
U-Unacceptable!
It is acceptable!
Let me do it.
This isn't my first time seeing a monster like that.
I've been wondering for a long time how those things are related to Ichi!
Ichigo?
dodge!
RIGHT!
are you okay?
Dude!
Dude!
Kurosaki!
What happened?
Who's that blood-soaked old dude?
Did you fight with him?
You beat him?
You dummies!
Keep away!
Go away!
What's with the attitude!
?
We were worried about you.
You're always likethat!
Kurosaki's just like the other girls after all.
Fickle and mean.
Yasutora?
What's the point of hitting? and what is left?
you're strong.
You're big.
You're beautiful.
You were born with just about all the things people ask of the gods.
can be suppressed. but that's how this world's set up. you be gentle.
strong fist of yours exists know that first. 100)}Note:
Abuelo means Grandfather in Spanish. that the reason my body is big is to protect.
I know it all.
I know all of it.
So... just a little give me strength.
What is with that arm?
Dude!
is your arm alright?
my God!
How dorky!
Couldn't he use something else...
DUDE!
I don't understand the armor that suddenly appeared on my right arm the unbelievable thing that came out of it the monster I was suddenly able to see clearly...
I don't understand any of it.
Except...
Ichigo's sister?
you're the only one who's hurt.
Oh.
That's good.
it ain't good!
What's so good that only you got hurt?
!
that's already NOT good!
That kind of thinking is just a show-off's logic!
you're just like Ichi!
I can't take it!
You just wait!
I'm gonna call my dad and have him treat you!
old dude!
eh?
She's just like Ichigo in the way she kicks.
With monsters running amok in the darkness of Karakura neighborhood...
Orihime suddenly appears!
41)}Warrior of hope 41)}Warrior of hope
88)}Orihime 88)}Orihime
Commanding six subordinates... with a SLASH and THRASH!
what are you talking about?
The preview for the next episode.
That's a little too convenient.
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently...
Until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate, life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
Who is that?
Captain of the Squad 3, Gin Ichimaru.
Oh, this isn't good.
Jidanbo!
Unacceptable.
A guardian of the gate isn't supposed to open the gates.
We were careless...
I didn't expect that someone like him would come all this way.
Even if these kids have become strong,
Captain level's strength is beyond imagination.
They cannot fight him...
We must avoid that worst possible scenario!
Ugh...
I lost!
Opening the gate is what is expected of a gatekeeper who has lost!
What are you saying?
A gatekeeper who lost isn't opening any gates.
When a gatekeeper loses...
It means..."death."
I-Ichigo!
What the hell are you doing?
!
That's my line!
Don't come now and try to butt in, you fox face!
Anyone who'd attack an unarmed guy...
Will be killed by me!
Hah!
You're funny kid.
You're not scared of me?
Not at all!
Hey!
Stop it Ichigo!
We will retreat for now!
Ichigo...?
- Huh?
!
Why?
!
- So then...
- I'm only just getting started!
- He's the one...
No way I can forgive guys like this!
It's okay.
- I'll just end it...
- So you're Ichigo Kurosaki...
You know about me?
Oh, just as I thought.
Huh?
!
Hey!
Where're you going?
!
Hey wait!
All the more reason why I can't let you pass.
Why're you standing so far back?
Are you going to throw your short sword?
It's not a short sword.
This is my Zanpaku-to.
Impale him, Shinso!
Kurosaki!
Kurosaki!
Darn it!
The gate...!
Bye bye!
- Ow!
Owwee!
- Are you all right, Kurosaki?
!
Kurosaki!
The gate?
!
Dammit!
It seems you're all right.
Sorry...the gate closed because of me...
No, your opponent was Gin Ichimaru.
It couldn't be helped.
Be glad that you weren't hurt.
- Inoue...
- Huh?
Take care of him.
Okay.
Who are they?
They were hiding until now.
Why?
We were feared.
Souls who come illegitimately to Soul Society without the aid of Soul Reapers are called Ryoka, and are said to be the cause of all kinds of calamities.
They think we are enemies?
Stay here!
Please wait.
Huh?
I am the elder of the Rukon District.
I witnessed everything that happened just now.
We want to welcome you as Jindanbo's saviors.
There are many rotten Soul Reapers, but Jidanbo is a native of the Rukon District.
And he's always kind to us.
You fought Gin Ichimaru for Jidanbo.
That's why you must be a good person.
But... what a terrible wound.
Okay!
Right!
Don't worry.
I'll heal Jidanbo's wounds.
Huh?
Inoue... you can heal that?
Yes, just leave it to me.
Shuno, Ayame!
Hi!
Need help?
Hello.
Please, lend me your power.
Certainly!
We are your power!
All you have to do is desire it.
Recite the Kotodama
- Spirit Chant!
Soten Kishun!
I reject!
Wow, that's amazing, Inoue.
When'd you get that power?
Excuse me!
Please let me through!
Let me through!
Oh!
Mister!
It's me!
Shibata!
Shibata?
Yes!
The parakeet, Shibata!
Mister!
Shibata...!
You put on some weight, huh?
No way!
That's because you only knew me as a parakeet.
Here, you don't change at all.
You stay the same as when you first get here.
I see...
Shibata...
Err...
About your mother...
This is my house.
It's kind of run down, but it's cool during summer and nice.
And my family are all really nice.
Family?
Yuichi, you came back.
Mom and Dad were worried.
Uh huh...
Mom and Dad?
Umm...
This boy is Hironari Horiuchi.
He's like my big brother.
How do you do.
Like your big brother?
In Soul Society, or rather the Rukon District, people who aren't related form family like units and live together.
People who died in different places, at different times, live together.
It's rare for one to meet up with a real family member who died earlier.
Don't the Soul Reapers reunite you with your family?
No.
By the way, I died in 1947 in Yamanashi Prefecture.
It's way before Shibata died.
Our age, the location, we're far apart.
Then you haven't seen your mother yet?
No, although I'm looking for her.
Don't worry!
You have all of us, Yuichi.
Please don't worry.
We're all like him in the beginning, but we change with time.
I...
I won't see my mom again...
I'm sorry, but can I stay with Shibata for a bit longer?
Sure.
I'll tell the family.
By the way, why are you here, Mister?
You're not dead, are you?
No...
I'm not.
Then why?
I wonder that too...
Huh?
On that rooftop...
Isn't that your Soul Reaper friend?
Even if he goes that high up, he won't be able to see beyond the gate.
But he'll still keep looking, without giving up.
That's the kind of guy Ichigo is.
I guess I was around your age...
When I started worrying about my looking different than everyone.
And I had this amazing strength I couldn't handle that was different from them.
What is this power I got?
I want to know...
I have a feeling that coming here will give me some clues.
That's why I came...
I thought I'd risk everything to search for answers.
You're really giving it your best, huh Mister?
That's why, Yuichi, don't give up.
Huh?
If you keep searching without giving up, you'll find your mother.
Isn't that so?
Mister...
Right, let's make a promise.
Uh huh!
Chad?
Yo!
What?
At least speak up if you're here.
I'm always behind you.
Huh?
What?
!
Give up breaking through the gate?
Not give up.
Once the gate has been opened, the security on the inside becomes even tighter.
Which means the same strategy is not the best one.
I agree.
What about other gates?
There won't be much difference with this one.
Then what do we do?
!
If we can't use the gate, we must enter another way.
Elder, do you know the Kukaku Shiba?
W-What?
!
I understand she's someone who constantly changes residences.
I haven't been able to find out where she lives now.
Kukaku...
Shiba...
You're not planning to go through the wall with that!
That?
!
Huh?
What's that noise?
What is it?
- What's happening?
!
- Owwee!
W-What is this guy?
Huh?
A boar?
!
Why?
What's a boar doing here?
!
Owee...
Darn... thrown again by my Bonnie.
Hey!
Been a long time, Old Man.
Ganju, what are you doing here?
!
Go home!
Some greeting!
I come to visit after a long time and I get that?
Your guests are shocked.
Oh...
What?
What's a dirty Soul Reaper doing here?
What?
Not "what?"!
What's a dirty Soul Reaper doing here, I asked!
Huh?
Say something, you dandelion head!
W-What're you doing?
!
You picking a fight?
!
That's my line!
Trying to goad me like that!
You primeval boar!
"Primeval boar"?
!
What'll we do?
!
We must stop them.
- Are you stupid?
- I'm not stupid!
- Oh dear...
Just as I expected.
- I got a name you know!
This is no time to drink tea!
Who is that guy?
You don't know who I am?
!
I don't.
- Neither do I.
- Don't know.
Don't even wanna know.
Hah...
Then it can't be helped.
I'll tell you.
My name is Ganju!
Self professed Crimson Bullet of West Rukon District!
Self professed the most "want to call you big brother" candidate for 14 years running!
And...!
Self professed West Rukongai's Top Soul Reaper Hater!
- All self professed!
- All self professed!
Hah!
You're hopeless.
What?
What?
Kurosaki!
Kurosaki!
Hold it!
Won't let you get in Big Brother's way.
If you really want to get involved in this fight...
We'll be your opponents.
Henchmen...
Wow...
All of them...
- Riding on boars!
- Riding on boars!
Get outta here!
While I'm alive, no Soul Reaper will be allowed to step foot...
In West Rukongai!
Huh?
!
Brother!
Cripes!
Cut it out, will ya?
!
If you wanna fight, I'll fight you.
Why you!
You punched my handsome face...
Not once, but twice!
I kicked you the second time around, idiot!
Enough, Ichigo!
Don't use up your strength in a meaningless fight.
He started the fight.
If you want us to stop, tell him.
Sheesh!
Getting worked up for such a silly thing...the fool!
It seems we're destined to fight, you and me.
Stop, Ganju!
He is not an evil Soul Reaper!
Shut up!
Soul Reapers are Soul Reapers.
There's no good or bad.
Ganju...
Get ready!
This is bad!
Kurosaki doesn't have his Zanpaku to!
Oh!
Thanks, Chad!
Huge!
So that's your Zanpaku-to!
However...
Don't think you can win with a bigger sword!
Sink!
W-What's this?
!
The ground!
It's like quicksand...!
Huh?
!
Why you!
Using weird tricks!
Damn, if that didn't drop you, you're pretty tough.
What's wrong?
Come at me!
Hey, what time is it?
!
It's bad, Big Brother!
It's nine already!
What?
!
No!
Come on, Bonnie!
Huh?
Bonnie...?

will be coming from Kukaku Shiba's house in West Rukon District.
It's a gorgeous wooden structure surrounded by open land.
What's the secret to this building?
Just watch and see.
These natural wood pillars...
Huh?

Kon.
Ha!
These are a warrior's scars!
they're awful!
And dirty too.
huh?
and just touching them takes a lot of courage.
Maybe I should just dump you in a bucket of water.
a towel?

Soul Reaper Illustrated Book...
Genryuusai-sensei!
I'm finished...
Are you OK?
I'm... fine...
Have you been taking your medicine?
seems like he hasn't...
How dare you?
!
It must suck to be this much like the raw material...
It's coming from over by the river.
That's definitely where Kuchiki-san's reiatsu was.
Wait!
you look for Nozomi-chan.
Please.
Got it.
you go with her.
No problem.
Are we there yet?
you'll see it in just a- that's it there.
So?
What's supposed to be over there?
you know.
The least you could do is tell me why.
I remember what you said.
I'll fix it even without protection.
What are you talking about?
That's why I came to Karakura Town.
Is that what this is about?
So you're playing dumb?
wait for me!
Kuchiki-san!
Wait!
This reiatsu...
Abarai-kun.
No...
It's not him.
Kujou Nozomi...
I was worried that my muscles would atrophy with nothing more challenging than simply searching for her.
This is nothing personal.
Inoue... you go ahead.
Sado-kun!
Please.
OK?
Sado.
Didn't think I'd be facing you tonight.
But if we're gonna do this...
I ain't holding back!

Hang in there...
I wonder if Old Man Yama's in good health?
but we still have no chance against Genryuusai-sensei in a straight fight.
I know that much.
Isn't that why we're going in together?
Old Man Yama!
Kyouraku and Ukitake!
Master?
We seek the wisdom of your counsel.
Enter.
We're coming in!
if we may speak to you...
Why do both of you come before me?
You must give a greater effort than that!
One does not allow an unwarned opponent to sense one's killing intent.
You are truly our master.
you really did see right through us.
foolish youths...
I would have you explain yourselves.
You heard the man.
We've got no choice...
Guess we'd better fight.
Yes.
Is it your intention to face me?
Very well.
Yamamoto Genryuusai Shigekuni shall not be defeated by young upstarts just yet!
Well?
It's true that there are records here of Shinigami Substitute Kurosaki and Captain Kyouraku entering and leaving the Severed World on a frequent basis.
Is this what Captain Kyouraku was trying to change?
he would not do something so obvious.
I suspect that this information is actually the falsified version.
If that's true... it would take someone of Captain Kurotsuchi's skills to pull it off.
this is too makeshift for Captain Kurotsuchi.
Then who?
I went to the Great Spirit Library Cloister a few hours ago to answer that very question.
The Great Spirit Library Cloister?
The one in the Underground Assembly Hall? regardless of the original owner's consent.
So what did you find out?
I learned which employee of the Bureau of Research and Development was responsible for the Severed World.
This man has exclusive access to a great deal of research on the Severed World.
however... was that there are no records of his existence prior to a certain time.
Even in the Great Spirit Library Cloister?
but he is definitely more than a mere researcher.
Aren't you?
Seventh Seat Inaba Kagerouza.
You are truly exceptional.
I anticipated having much more time before you came to that conclusion.
To think that you would even explore the Great Spirit Library Cloister...
Isane!
Yes ma'am!
You waste your time.
You appear to have phased through time and space.
Is this the fruit of your Severed World research?
You are most perceptive.
Though the technology is still incomplete.
You used the Severed World to divide Soul Society from the Human World.
What is your objective?
You will understand soon enough.

Were you waiting for me?
you're doing a great job if you can fight like this against even an impostor version of me!
So this is a regal.
Interesting.
but even the best fake... is just gonna get crushed!
surely it's OK for you to tell me now?
What's supposed to be over here?
Still playing dumb?
A Senkai Gate.
a Senkai Gate.
a Senkai Gate?
!
Isn't that something Shinigami are supposed to open?
we discovered that there are many previously unknown Senkai Gates.
One of them is through here.
And what are you planning to do with this gate?
Let's go.
There's a Senkai Gate here?
I get it!
You're gonna open that gate and run away somewhere!
H-Hey!
I'm not running away.
This is it.
The space is distorted.
What is this?
does it?
This is a natural Senkai Gate.
There are countless severed worlds that connect Soul Society and the Human World.
and so they are dangerous.
and we don't know where they lead.
This is one of them.
no-one will ever find you.
then.
So how long are you planning to hide?
Forever.
Aaah... what?
!
It's all I can do.
there's no coming back to the same time and space.
wait?
Why do ya gotta go and do something so extreme?
It sounds like complete overkill!
I told you that Ichigo- that we'd all protect you!
Is this really what you wish for?
What I wish for...
You've got lots of reasons to live!
Look at me
- I got to live on thanks to meeting Ichigo.
Soul Society and the Human World will both fall under my control.
But... this is the only way to stop him.
You mean... got it!
then I'll go with you!
it's not because I'm worried about you!
Or because I think you'll be lonely on your own. so I figured it might not be too bad to lie back and relax in the Severed World for a bit...
You... you want to kiss me?
I like your way of saying thank you... what'd you call this?
Untie me this instant!
I'll go alone.
Moron.
Who's the moron here?
!
But I'll remember your kindness.
Nozomi!
Damn it!
Stop!
Don't do it!
Nozomi!
Nozomi-chan!
Where might you be heading?
A reigai!
Let's not have any more of you acting out on your own.
You sure you want to pick a fight against these numbers?
Why?
you ask?
You imbecile.
Did you think you were the only one who knew about this Severed World?
Kagerouza knows everything you're doing.
Let go!
come over here.
you!
Get your filthy hands off her!
I'm the one you're fighting - come at me!
Or are you peeing your pants in terror?
let's go.
No!
I don't want to go!
don't ignore me!
I don't want to go!
Hey!
You bastards!
No!
I won't go!
Is that right?
Is that what you want?
Kurosaki Ichigo!
You've come...
You're fucking late!
What kept you?
!
Don't you realize they nearly captured her?
!
Shut up.
You were the one who was wandering around without telling anyone.
at least get in touch.
you big dummy!
Hand Kujou Nozomi over to us.
How about no.
There are six of us and only one of you.
You really think you can keep her safe?
Make that two!
Sure I can.
Why?
Because that's your wish.
then.
It's not like we can just withdraw either.
Let's get this over with.
right?
Haven't you got a Zanpakutou or something?
No.
I could at least take one of them down.
Are you worried?
if it was him we'd be fine.
But now...
Nothing wrong with being worried about your friends!
Nothing wrong... with being worried...
He's fighting to protect... his friends...
Damn.
What's wrong?
Your reiatsu has gone down.
Looks like time's not on your side.
then.
I'm doing it.
I-Ichigo!
Your Shinigami powers-
Shut up!
It's not like I have other options!

Did we lose?
We lost... didn't we?
Kurosaki-san?
did I...?
you haven't been out that long.
570)}It's only been about half a day since you collapsed.
570)}I see.
What about the others?
570)}I can't say they've made a full recovery just yet.
their wounds are healing steadily.
570)}I see.
so we brought you here to my home instead.
Was that all right?
570)}Yeah.
Sorry for the trouble.
your priority should be getting all your strength back.
We can think about the rest after that.
I'm going to go make some tea.
Urahara-san...
Did I...
lose my reiatsu?
Yes.
That means I can't rescue Nozomi anymore...
That means...
I lost... to Kagerouza...
Hmm...
I really couldn't say.
He is over the worst of it.
I think it's safe to say that we shouldn't expect General Yamamoto to return to the front lines for the immediate future.
I see.
What about the others?
It is too early to say.
Third Seat Madarame and Fifth Seat Ayasegawa's injuries are so grave that they have yet to show any signs of recovery at all.
Oh my... time may also be necessary.
All we can do is help them as best we can.
What should we do?
too.
I'll...
Vice-Captain Abarai?
he is surely reforming his army in Soul Society even as we speak.
Even so...
I know what you are feeling.
You desire to rescue the mod soul girl.
But right now I am in no position to tell you anything other than to stand by.
Understood.
Kurosaki-san?
There's no point in staying here.
Kurosaki-san.
Shall we go for a little walk?
I remember this place...
Then how about we go sing karaoke or something?
just the two of us?
That's no good?
I don't mind.
and we all go together?
too?
Sure thing!
I'm so powerless...
I can't even look after myself.
Urahara-san.
Yes?
My reiatsu... is there any way to get it back?
Kurosaki-kun!
You guys!
Ichigo.
What's with the long faces?
Is it because I've lost my spiritual powers?
Don't worry about that.
all we can do is focus on saving Nozomi.
I can't really fight anymore.
I'll do whatever I can.
Kurosaki...
Ichigo!
How come...
I can see you?
Of course you can see us.
we're in gigai right now.
right.
but you look absolutely fine.
Should I apologize?
Ichigo.
my spiritual powers are gone.
But I haven't lost my soul.
but that doesn't mean I've given up.
stupid?
This stuff was never your responsibility alone.
yeah.
did any of us say you were giving up?
who are the rest of us going to keep trying to catch up to?
You fool.
Thanks.
This isn't something to thank me for!
remember?
!
That's got nothing to do with it.
Can't you act your age for a change?
you bastard?

stupid?
Didn't you already say that?

sir?
I will commence treatment immediately.
Don't touch me!
I am about to begin fusing with Nozomi.
Proceed with the preparations!

Be silent!
Be silent!
to join Nozomi in our true form but a second sooner... our only option is to infiltrate Soul Society at the earliest opportunity.
that also means his attention is no longer directed at us.
the people in this room are the only fighting force we have.
Ichigo or no Ichigo.
Ichigo.
Like that makes me feel better.
Hold on.
Is Kurosaki really no longer relevant?
We know why Kagerouza was so set on retrieving Kujou-san.
But something is really bothering me.
Why did he even have to take precautions against Kurosaki?
Isn't it just because he was always around Nozomi-chan?
That's one reason.
But the biggest reason was probably Kurosaki-san's Hollow powers.
His Hollow powers?
he can make a reigai.
And yet he never made a reigai of Kurosaki-san.
and he tried to eliminate him in person again and again.
It seems reasonable to assume that Kagerouza is unable to make such a reigai.
You mean Kagerouza can't manipulate Hollow powers and that's why he was so wary of Ichigo.
Is that right?
Yes.
Is that why he used the Severed World to try and have Ichigo killed by the Capturing Ram?
that actually happened twice.
Twice?
when Rukia and I were breaking in.
When I lost my Substitute Badge.
Your Substitute Badge... and got swallowed up by the Capturing Ram.
But what saved me from it?
I see... could that be the reason?
we may be able to restore your reiatsu.
Seriously?
1236)}You can get his reiatsu back?
!
570)}What are you talking about?
but... and absorbs them.
570)}But its inner temporal axis is isolated from that of any world.
570)}So the particles it absorbs aren't destroyed - they continue to accumulate.
Kagerouza was able to retrieve decades-old mod soul research data from there.
the spirit particles from when Kurosaki-san was absorbed by the Capturing Ram should still be in there.
We can recover those particles and then reverse-engineer Kagerouza's reigai technology to artificially construct Kurosaki-san's spiritual powers.
You don't mean...?
Indeed.
We must infiltrate the Bureau of Research and Development.
Is that even possible?
It sounds like science fiction.
But how can we retrieve the spirit particles we need?
we may as well be dead.
I've always found it quite mysterious that neither Kagerouza nor Nozomi-san have any reiatsu we can sense.
That is where the solution lies.
Kagerouza retrieved mod soul data from inside the Capturing Ram.
he can enter and leave the Capturing Ram at will.
Kurosaki-san may now be able to enter the Capturing Ram.
Kurosaki-san?
I don't really understand it all.
I can't think of any way to save Nozomi.
So I've got no choice but to try.
ready?
Yeah.
I'm attaching a transmitter.
kindly follow any and all instructions.
Take this too.
I've adjusted it to respond to locations with your spirit particles.
press this button.
Got it.
Hey!
Kon!
all beaten up like that?
I'm going inside the Capturing Ram to retrieve my spirit particles.
What the hell are you thinking?
!
This is the only way to save Nozomi.
See ya.
Are you crazy or something?
!
It's all my fault.
so why are you the one doing this?
Kon...
I'm powerless!
I can't do anything!
I can't protect anyone!
I have to get you to fight for me!
I have to get all of you to fight for me!
Even though it's all my fault...
Kon.
It's not your fault.
you wait here.
I promise I'll be back.
Here.
What's this?
No point in me carrying it around.
A good luck charm?
Thanks.
are you ready?
Yeah.
you should be able to move around the Severed World rather freely.
please wait a little longer.
Got it!
Kurosaki-san!
Here it comes!
100...
He's in!
This looks good.
everything has gone smoothly.
So this is the inside of the Capturing Ram.
but the pressure's incredible.
the detector should react to them.
I've got something.
I'll try and find them.
Ichigo!
Kurosaki-kun!
Kurosaki!
The Capturing Ram's flow changed sharply.
What's going on?
!
It may be trying to expel foreign objects as a response to swallowing Kurosaki-san.
we're abandoning the plan!
Please get out of there!
Ichigo... he says!
How do I do that?
!
No way.
I'm doing this.
Damn it!
Ichigo.
Ichigo!
Ichigo!
Say something!
Ichigo!
damn it!
You promised me you'd come back!
you bastard?
!
will ya?
I can hear!
Every!
Word!
It's responding!
Got it!
Now for the exit!
Is that it?
Guess I'd better check it out.
What the?
!
Why is there another me?
but what the hell!
Kurosaki-san!
You really had me worried there for a second!
That's my line for sure.
What happened in there?
but there was another me inside the Capturing Ram.
but...
You saved another you?
!
Are you sure you didn't leave your brain in there?
What are you trying to say?
I see.
I thought that might be the case.
What might?
That was the you who was swallowed by the Capturing Ram last time.
The temporal axis inside the Capturing Ram is isolated from every world.
Meaning that the things it swallows don't exist inside any other temporal axis.
You mean he met his past self inside the Ram?
Indeed.
It was the present Kurosaki-san who saved himself in the past.
This all sounds very complicated... then.
I never did understand how the reigai could have obtained Ichigo's badge before we ever arrived.
This seems to be the explanation for how they did it.
Everything was done using the same trick.
whatever.
You lost me a while ago.
right?
Let's go.
Time to pay Kagerouza a home visit.
Right.
I came back after all.
a lot of good I did.
I wouldn't say that.
Huh?
What?
I probably wouldn't have made it out.
Or found my other self.
It's all thanks to you... stupid?
Tell me how you really feel.
S-Stop that!
Since when are we best buds?
What the?
!
Take that!
My stuffing!
You're flattening me...
All dimensions are in alignment.
Let us begin.
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently...
until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate, life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
I cannot believe this!
Do you realize what you have done?
!
Look at this!
This was broadcast nationwide the other day.
Nationwide!
Ichigo Kurosaki!
Do you know how much dishonor you brought upon this school with the airing of this footage?
!
Mr. Kagine!
Kurosaki and Kuchiki were on television, so I can understand why they were called in.
But there's no reason why Inoue and I should be here.
Weren't you there, too?
By coincidence.
We met them by accident and were not involved!
Why you...!
Trying to save your own necks!
And so, we're going back to class.
Let's go, Orihime.
Oh... then me, too.
Not you!
You were with him, but did nothing to stop him.
You're just as guilty!
W-What's the fuss just 'cuz we were on TV?
"Just 'cuz"?
!
Haven't you realized that you're here precisely because of that lack of awareness?
!
I'm flabbergasted!
I'm so sorry.
It's all my fault...
I couldn't stop Kurosaki who was so determined to get on TV...
It's my fault.
I really tried my best, but...
Ohh...
Don't cry, Kuchiki.
I understand.
It's not your fault.
I don't care what you do to Kurasaki, so please spare me...
Hmm?
Hey, you brats!
Do you know what will happen if you run away?
!
You boys!
And now, even Kuchiki has disappeared!
Principal!
Now, now, you don't have to scold them so severely, just because they were on TV.
I cannot believe you all!
All's well that end's well.
It's all thanks to you, Rukia.
Oh please...
Stupid, don't compliment her.
She tried to sell me out.
But thanks to her act, you were able to slip away, too.
That's right.
It was just an a... c... t.
I wouldn't dream of selling out a friend like Kurosaki.
Why you!
By the way, Kurosaki, may I speak with you?
Huh?
Please excuse us, everyone.
What was that?
Kurosaki and Kuchiki...
Huh?
Are they seeing each other?
No way!
At least, Kuchiki wouldn't.
But something's suspicious...
No way!
Huh?
!
There's no Hollow.
What's going on anyway?
Maybe that cell phone is broken.
Strange...
There was an order that a Hollow had appeared.
Hey, spirit!
Huh?
!
You didn't exterminate a Hollow by any chance, did you?
H-Hollow... you mean that scary bug-like thing?
I-I was so scared...
I thought I was gonna pee on myself!
Stay away from me!
I'm asking you what happened!
Wait, Ichigo.
Did someone defeat the Hollow and save you?
And if so, who was it?
I-I was so scared, I had my eyes closed.
I don't know!
Wha...?
!
Why you!
Well, it's Konso time.
Let's go!
Huh?
!
What's a Konso?
W-What's that sword for?
!
Third place?
You always do so well.
Wow!
Orihime, you're that smart?
She doesn't look it though, huh?
Wonderful!
You are my Hime, after all!
Oh...
Well, besides the girls doing well, no one betrayed us by getting into the top 50.
Look carefully.
Huh?
W-W-What?
!
23rd place?
!
No way!
How can you be up there?
!
Shut up.
I study because there's nothing else to do at home.
Nothing to do?
!
No way!
I always ask you to hang out!
I get it!
That's what you were doing when you turned me down!
You pervert!
Nerd!
A person like you deserves thick glasses like these...
No thanks.
So you actually study, Ichigo?
Well yeah...
It can be tough when you have orange hair like this.
I see.
I guess there are all kinds of things in life.
A person like you deserves a nerd headband...
I said I don't want it!
Fine!
I get it!
I'll never ask you to hang out again!
Hey Chad, c'mon and join me.
You're not in the top fifty, right?
Huh?
What?
!
I-I never thought you guys were so evil!
Not once!
I'll never play with you guys again!
Uh-oh... you made him cry.
If we're evil, what about the guy who's number one?
Ametatsu Ishida?
Never heard of that name.
It's Uryu.
Uryu Ishida.
You know him?
He's in our class.
Huh?
Forget it, Orihime.
He never remembers a person's name or face.
Let's go.
Hmm... was there such a guy?
He's not there!
Urahara!
Why don't you answer when I call you at times like this?
!
You always show up when you're not needed.
And you call yourself a businessman!
Hmm...
I wanted him to take a look at my Soul Pager.
I can't tell if it's broken or not.
Found him!
Let's go sing some karaoke.
The worker there...
Kurosaki!
Come with me a moment!
Rukia is quite aggressive.
I think they really are seeing each other.
It's a Hollow.
A Hollow?
I hope it's really there this time.
Shut up!
Let's go!
Sorry!
After all this!
There was no Hollow again!
Shut up!
Get back into your body now!
Damn!
Do something about that useless cell phone!
Are you saying that it's my fault?
!
I just relay whatever comes through the Soul Pager.
So hurry it up and fix that thing!
I want to as well.
Breaking up?
How unsightly.
Good evening, Kurosaki...
Kuchiki.
Who are you?
How do you know our names?
Kurosaki, you can see spirits, right?
W-What're you saying?
!
A new Hollow has appeared.
What?
H-He's right.
It's an order.
Which way?
Over there.
You don't know such a basic thing and you call yourself a Soul Reaper?
Go!
It disappeared.
Just what are you?
!
Uryu Ishida.
A Quincy.
I hate Soul Reapers.
What?
Don't you understand?
I'm telling you...
Ichigo Kurosaki...
I hate you.
Damn!
Just what is that guy?
You don't know such a basic thing and you call yourself a Soul Reaper?
Why do I have to be insulted like that by someone I met for the first time?
!
I'll get that bastard the next time we meet.
That bastard?
Umm... what did he say his name was?
Ishida... err...
Willy?
Nope.
That's that celebrity no one likes.
Ishida...
Ishida again?
Inoue!
Oh... no...
Uryu Ishida, right?
Huh?
Yeah him!
You're well informed, Inoue.
I'm really not.
But Ishida and I are in the Handicrafts Club.
So I know his name, at least.
Handicrafts Club?
!
See?
That's Ishida.
T-That's him.
And he's in the Handicrafts Club?
Yup.
Look.
Conveniently, Michiru brought a torn stuffed animal.
Very convenient turn of events indeed.
Watch.
I-It's fixed!
Thank you, Ishida!
No problem.
It's no big deal.
Huh?
I'm sorry.
He'd be nice if he didn't say things like that.
He sure is weird.
Say, Ichigo...
Did something happen between you and him?
Just something minor.
It's no big deal.
I see...
You plan on following me home?
Ichigo Kurosaki?
Damn, you knew?
When did you notice?
From the time you and Inoue watched me from the door.
Hmm...
I'm impressed.
You're something else.
Your spiritual energy is always leaking out, like a fool.
Even a monkey would notice.
What?
!
I think you're lacking the ability to detect those with high spiritual energy.
The proof lies in the fact that you didn't notice my existence until today.
Sorry about that.
I'm bad at remembering people's faces.
I'm not talking about that.
From the time you entered school
I knew that you had unusually high spiritual energy.
Also, that you became a Soul Reaper around the middle of May.
And...
I know Rukia Kuchiki's true identity.
Spirit Ribbons!
Yes, Spirit Ribbons.
The compression and manifestation of spiritual energy in the atmosphere.
And...
What's this?
!
Your Spirit Ribbon.
You don't know?
Soul Reapers' Spirit Ribbons have different colors.
Let us duel, Ichigo Kurosaki.
You or me...
I'll show you who is the stronger.
And also, that Soul Reapers aren't necessary in this world.
Urahara Store It's a duel!
Rock, Paper...
Scissors!
Look away, then show!
Rock, Paper...
Scissors!
Look away, then show!
I guess it's your turn to sweep, Jinta.
I didn't lose!
I haven't lost yet!
I said it's two out of three!
You never said that!
Never!
Owwee!
Oweee!
Quit complaining!
Ome more time, I said!
What... are you doing, Jinta?
3 meters Oh... nothing...
Te...
Eh...
Mr. Tessai!
Huh?
You have some business today, Kuchiki?
Huh?
What's the matter?
Is Urahara here?
It's Kuchiki!
What can I do for you-?
!
"What can I do for you"?
!
I called you time and time again, but you never answer!
So I've come!
Oh, I'm sorry.
We've been quite busy lately.
Say, what happened to that spiky-haired guy?
Well, I don't like him, so it's better that he stayed away.
Hey Jinta!
I need to ask you something.
What is it?
A duel?
You and me?
That's right.
Hah!
That's ridiculous!
What?
Why do I have to do such a stupid thing?
!
I don't know what kind of grudge you have against Soul Reapers, but it's got nothing to do with me.
How unexpected.
You're trying to get out of it?
Don't try to goad me into it.
Besides, it would be no contest.
I see.
I just remembered.
You're a Soul Reaper who received your powers from Kuchiki...
You're a substitute Soul Reaper.
Without her authority, you can't even lift a finger.
What?
!
Quincy?
I haven't heard that name in a long time.
It has a nostalgic ring to it, doesn't it?
It's been nearly 200 years since we heard that name.
What's it mean?
Quincy...
A tribe which once existed scattered throughout the world, which specialized in destroying Hollows.
They became extinct about 200 years ago.
Extinct?
Yes...
Humans who had powers like Kurosaki sensed the existence of Hollows and began to train to fight against them... that's how the tribe started.
Like Soul Reapers, their mission was to destroy Hollows.
However, there was one disctinct difference between them and Soul Reapers.
And that was, whether to kill Hollows or not.
The Soul Reapers seek to purify Hollows with their Zanpaku-to and allow them to cross over into the Soul Society.
But Quincys sought to totally kill them.
When you think about it, it was a very human thing to do.
Hollows devour human souls.
They hurt and kill our friends and family.
So why would you want to send them to the Soul Society peacefully?
It was only natural that they opposed it.
So they always tried to kill Hollows.
They believed that they were avenging their comrades.
But due to that belief, they were destroyed.
Fine!
Let's do it.
We'll have a duel!
Hey Ichigo!
Huh?
You may've been obeying Rukia's orders, but how dare you stuff me in that bag?
!
Let's change.
Hey, wait!
Not again?
!
Got it!
Slimy...
Kon, watch me.
I'm gonna kick his butt!
Huh?
All right, explain it to me... the rules of this battle.
Hurry!
Though the voyage must continue on
May seas always be calm
When the cycle of the moon has renewed may it shine
It's light to guide your boat
I offer this voyage a prayer
With each new day that still awaits
On vividly shining seas
To the end of the journey
I'm Rukia Kuchiki, the prettiest girl in Bleach!
Rukia's Q A Corner I'd like to read you some letters today.
First from Momoko in the Nakano District.
"Rukia, what is the secret to your beauty?
This is not the place for that!
- I'm waiting for your letters!
- No way!
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently...
until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate, life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight

Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
You're mine!
Not deep enough!
That thing's face...
It was Inoue's brother.
But why would Inoue's brother come after me?
I don't know.
But judging from the Hollow that attacked you last time, it seems a powerful Hollow who remains in the dark wants to devour your spiritual power.
And it probably controls several Hollows.
Then Inoue's brother's appearance would make sense.
No way!
So, what should I do?
!
I can't kill Inoue's brother?
!
Think!
If you don't kill him, he will wander around forever!
And there's no doubt he will attack you again.
Wait, we may not have time to worry about him!
What do you mean?
That girl is in danger!
Wasn't that delicious?
Yeah.
How about some dessert now?
I have some leeks and bean jam jelly.
What?
They go great together.
I'm not too keen for that.
Huh?
What was that?
Oh... poor Enraku!
This is terrible.
How come you're all torn up?
What's that?
!
The Hollows target their own kin?
!
It happens frequently.
What do you mean?
Hollows are fallen souls.
Souls that were not guided into the Soul Society by a Soul Reaper.
Souls that were not protected by Hollows.
They lose their hearts and become Hollows themselves.
Now that this Hollow has failed to devour you, he will go after the soul of the one he loved most in his life.
Remember the bruise on Inoue's leg today?
That was the mark left by a Hollow.
Then that accident was Inoue's brother's doing?
Perhaps.
What is this?
O-Orihime!
What is this?
!
How come there's blood?
!
W-What is that?
!
W-What is that?
What's happening?
What is that ghostly thing?
Is that... me?
Why?
What is this chain?
I can't breathe...
Tatsuki!
What am I doing here in a daze?
!
Take that!
Tatsuki!
Tatsuki!
Stay away!
Tatsuki!
What's wrong?
Tatsuki!
It's useless, Orihime.
She can't hear us, let alone see us.
Tatsuki!
How...
How do you know my name?
How sad, Orihime...
Have you forgotten my voice?
It's me... can't you tell?
Stay away!
How sad...
I'm so sad!
So sad!
Aren't I the one you're after?
!
Dammit!
Tatsuki, you got caught up in this?
Kurosaki?
It IS you!
But why?
Inoue...
Say, how come you can see me?
Huh...
Well...
Soul Reapers are spiritual beings.
Only other spiritual beings can see you.
It's impossible for ordinary people to see you.
Spiritual being?
That's right.
In other words, she's a spirit.
Orihime is dead!
Dammit!
Don't move!
Ichigo!
Hey, Ichigo!
Hang on, Ichigo!
Ichigo!
Ichigo!
Kurosaki!
Let go!
Let go!
Kurosaki is hurt!
Let go!
Orihime...
Have you forgotten me?
Brother?
Ichigo!
Wake up, Ichigo!
Will you shut up?
!
Is that any way to talk?
Where were you hit?
Forget it.
I'm okay.
Really?
Good.
Don't forget.
He may have been Inoue's older brother, but he's a monster.
He doesn't have a human heart.
Kill him without fail.
Are you really my brother?
Yes, I am, Orihime.
You're lying.
My brother would never do what you're doing.
I was lonely.
Huh?
You were forgetting about me...
little by little.
After I died you prayed for me every day.
I watched you...
It was your prayers that gave me peace.
But after about a year you became friends with that girl.
After that... you began praying for me less and less often.
And when you entered high school, you stopped praying for me altogether.
That's why...
I was so lonely...
Brother, you're wrong!
Listen, Orihime!
If you have even a shred of feeling left for me, do not betray me anymore!
Just listen to what I tell you.
It won't take long.
I'll devour that Soul Reaper and end this quickly!
Wait!
Kurosaki has nothing to do with this!
Please stop, Brother!
Don't hurt him anymore!
Be quiet!
Whose fault do you think it is that I became this way?
!
It's your fault!
You will listen to what I say!
Otherwise...
I'll kill you first!
Stop!
Listen, you...
Do you know why big brothers are born first?
It's to protect the little brothers and sisters that follow.
Ichigo!
Yet you're threatening to kill your own sister?
Don't say that, even if you are dead!
Shut up!
Orihime is mine!
I raised her when our parents abandoned us!
It was when Orihime was three...
I've protected her ever since!
Orihime!
Come to me!
If you listen to me, I won't lay a hand on the others.
Wait, it's a trap!
He no longer has the feelings of a brother.
But...
Entrance Ceremony
Brother!
Brother!
What's happening?
!
Orihime is... mine!
As if!
Inoue is Inoue!
She doesn't belong... to anyone!
Why are you hesitating!
Finish him!
Inoue...
Ori... hime...
I'm sorry, Brother.
It's my fault.
It's all because I begged you not to leave me alone.
Brother!
Please don't die!
Please don't leave me alone!
That's why you couldn't... rest in peace.
Orihime...
I sensed that you were always beside me.
Even yesterday, when that car almost hit me...
You protected me, right?
You pulled my leg to get me out of the way.
So that's why...
But if I keep depending on you, you'll never be able to rest.
So I wanted to show you...
I'm happy.
You don't have to worry about me.
But that made you lonely... and sad...
That's not it!
What's going on?
He's fighting the Hollow inside him.
He didn't become a Hollow by choice.
He probably was taken over by a Hollow...
Why?
Don't you get it?
His target was supposed to be you.
A soul that is devoured by a strong Hollow is manipulated by that Hollow.
In other words, a Hollow who is after you took over a soul whom you would hesitate to fight, and forced him to attack.
Right now, he is desperately fighting that Hollow.
For his sister's sake...
Orihime!
Ori...
Inoue!
Stay calm!
The chain attached to her chest, the Chain of Fate, is still connected.
As long as it is connected, she will not die.
I need to treat her.
Get back.
I can use my Kido to save her.
You gave that to her as a present, didn't you?
Inoue said so...
That's why she wears it every day.
Hey!
Even if I stay here like this, eventually I'll revert to being a monster.
So now... while I still have a semblance of sanity...
I want to disappear.
Hey!
Hey wait!
Ichigo!
He's making the right decision.
Once you become a Hollow, you can never go back to what you were.
Let him pass on.
Rukia!
It's all right.
Reaping a Hollow is not really killing it.
You're cleansing its soul and allowing it to enter the Soul Society.
That is why we Soul Reapers exist.
Wait, Brother...
That hairpin that you bought me that day...
We had a fight over it, remember?
Because I said it was too childish.
I let you go to work without saying anything...
That was the last time I would see you alive.
So, I want to say it now...
Brother, have a nice day.
Yeah, I'm off now.
It's true!
A sumo champion really came to my room... and blasted a hole with a gun!
Huh?
Not again!
Can't you make it sound more realistic?
At least, say a pro wrestler came and caused a brawl outside.
Well, I like Hime's silly imagination.
I'm saying it's true!
Right, Tatsuki?
Uh... yeah.
Huh?
Tatsuki, don't tell me you agree.
So is that what you did yesterday?
Yes.
Kurosaki, what is this?
Inoue?
!
Hey, what're you doing?
!
Memory Replacement.
I erased her memories of tonight and replaced them with new ones.
Memory Replacement?
But I can't choose the new memories, which can be a problem.
In any case, we'll find out tomorrow.
You used it on my family the other day, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
What is it?
I don't have the resolve to do this yet.
I'm not such a fine human being that I can promise to risk my life for a stranger.
However...
I'm not a total slime who'd watch someone get hurt before my eyes.
I'll help you...
do the work of a Soul Reaper.
Thanks, I'm counting on you.
Though the voyage must continue on
May seas always be calm
When the cycle of the moon has renewed may it shine
It's light to guide your boat
I offer this voyage a prayer
With each new day that still awaits
On vividly shining seas
To the end of the journey
Brother, thank you for watching over me all this time.
I'll do my best to find happiness.
So...
Brother, take care.
Inoue...
This is supposed to be the preview...
Aw no, we're out of time again!
Pain that won't heal
Sadness you feel
Scars that just refuse to fade from memory
Sometimes the burden's too much for one to bear
Don't give up on me, please don't turn me away
Whoa!
I'll hold your hand in mine
Will I lose my hold on her someday?
Will her smile fade in a flood of tears Or can I keep the fears at bay?
Echoing, distant voices wither into silence.
But there is one thing that will never ever age...
My love for you is timeless
Pain that won't heal
Sadness you feel
Smiles with hearts' bitterness replaced
"I'll never smile again"
"I'll never let love in"
Don't ever say such things to me
A future we cannot see
All happenings Find meaning in the story
In time the clouds will clear away, so just stay, please stay with me...
Whoa!
Who are we to pass through you?
Whoa!
That answer will find you someday
Group 2, take the East Sector!
Group 6, sweep the North West Sector!
Group 3, take South Sector!
Report in when the Ryoka are captured!
Damn!
Where'd those Ryoka go, anyway?
!
We'll get you, Ryoka, for sure!
Naturally!
Quick, over there!
Before another group finds them!
How come everybody's acting like thugs, all of a sudden?
Rats.
A dead end!
Ain't you going senile?
!
You'll get it, you!
Hah!
You're idiots for following me!
What?
!
You're the idiot!
Hey, calm down, guys!
The search perimeter for Squad 6, Group 126 to 143 has changed.
- You're in the way!
Move!
Move!
- Your new perimeter will be West Sector,
- Yow!
I'm sorry!
- From Street 58 to Street 76.
Squad 4 shouldn't get in the way!
Yow!
It'll spill!
It'll spill!
Don't screw up menial chores!
Move it!
Your new perimeter will be West Sector,
- from Street 58 to Street 76.
- Phew.
Rukia, I've brought your food...
Rukia?
Rukia!
Rukia?
!
Who's there?
Oh, yes'm.
I'm the caretaker for Rukia Kuchiki.
Where is she...?
You're from Squad 4?
Rukia Kuchiki has already been sent to the Senzaikyu penitentiary.
What?
!
B-But...
What's wrong?
Oh... um ...
I didn't know...
A search has been ordered for Ryoka who infiltrated the Seireitei.
Return to your Squad at once.
Rukia...
What was that light this morning?
From in here, I can't feel any spiritual energy.
Could it really be...?
Ichigo...
Don't talk like it's ended.
I haven't shown you my skill yet.
It starts now, lkkaku.
This time, you'll be the one who can't hold your sword!
Fine words.
Greenhorn!
Where does that confidence come from?
Slow!
I won't be able to hold my sword?
!
Don't make me laugh!
It's you who won't hold your sword again!
Wasn't I supposed to be slow?
Humph!
You are.
That was a fluke.
I'll show you it's not a fluke.
I told you... too slow!
Lucky!
Humph!
What's wrong?
Talk is all you can do?
Hozuki-maru can transform at will.
A greenhorn like you can't keep up, can you?
That's not true.
I've finally...gotten used to your attack.
This guy...
He took Hozuki maru with his bare hand...!
Kenny, over there, over there!
They're over there!
We've been running for a while, but haven't seen anyone...
Don't worry!
I've got super keen intuition!
Oh!
Go right!
Right!
It's a dead end!
That way, then!
Go back, go back!
Are you sure we can trust this intuition of yours?
Uh!
Ms. Inoue!
Hide!
Found them?
!
Where'd they go...?
It looks like we really caused a big commotion.
It'll be difficult to meet up with Kurosaki and the others before searching for Ms. Kuchiki.
If there was a commotion someplace, we'd find one of them there.
Perhaps we should just jump in...
Or...
What do you think, Ms. Inoue?
Huh?
Ms. Inoue?
W-Where'd she go?
Ishida-a-a!
Huh?
!
What happened, anyway?
!
Sorry!
I went scouting, and they spotted me!
Since they've seen us, I'll have to fight!
I'll fight, too!
No!
Leave this to me!
They stopped!
Get them!
Don't worry.
You stand back.
But...
Found them!
Get them!
Yow!
We found them!
So many...!
Can you beat them, Ishida...?
Run!
They're running!
After them!
After them!
What's that?
Is it Ichigo...?
Or...?
What's wrong, lkkaku?
Don't look so surprised.
I hope you haven't lost your nerve.
If you won't attack, I will!
I'll say it again, lkkaku...!
The one who won't be able to hold his sword is you!
D-Dammit!
Heh...!
What's wrong?
It's over already...?
Too bad!
I can still hold my sword!
If you want to make me stop, you'll have to cut off my arm!
Put down your sword.
No way!
Don't!
The fight's over!
You know it!
You lost!
Rubbish.
This is a fight.
It's over only when one is left alive!
Slow!
Damn...
You sure... are strong...
Crap...
I wasn't lucky...
Neither of us was lucky... bastard...
Where'd he go...?
!
That was close!
When will you stop running?
When you give up.
Stop, already.
I'm getting tired of this.
I'll end it now...with my...
Fuji Kujaku.
Heh, heh.
End it, you say?
I'd say...
Don't be so hasty!
S-Stop it!
How disagreeable!
My beautiful eyes are smarting!
How'd you like that?
!
The Kukaku brand hot pepper smoke bomb!
The Tears of Blood is powerf
What's this?
!
My eyes hurt!
Ouch, ouch!
My throat, too...!
What do you think of this power...?
Unbelievable!
You harmed yourself with your own strategy.
Too ugly!
I breathed it in.
W-Where are you...?
!
Hah!
You're not catching me!
H-Hey.
Let go!
How can I?
!
How come...
I'm still alive?
You're awake?
Yo.
Ichigo...
Why are you still here?
Well, I learned something...
The released Zanpaku to returns to its original form when the owner goes unconscious.
My Hozuki maru!
Bastard!
Give it back...!
I'm not gonna take it.
I just used some of the medicine in it to stop the bleeding.
But I used it all up on the both of us.
But it sure works great, this medicine...!
B-Bastard!
That was dirty!
Why?
!
Sure, I used it up, but that's no reason to get so mad.
That's not it!
Damn...!
I knew something was wrong!
I didn't die, even after losing so much blood...!
I can't live on like this... in shame.
Damn!
If I could only move, I'd beat you to a pulp!
Crap.
What's with you?
Shouldn't have saved you.
Well, appreciate it or not, it doesn't much matter to me.
All I want are some answers.
Humph.
I knew something like this was coming.
I sure am unlucky.
What do you wanna know?
When my birthday is?
Where's Rukia Kuchiki?
Let go, you're heavy...
Dammit!
Can't hold on...!
No!
Please!
Don't let go!
If we fall in there...!
Those who fall in can never get out.
Can't hold...on!
I don't wanna die!
Help!
W-What's with this place?
!
Pee-yew!
Hey, you!
I thought you said nobody could ever get out of here!
This is an ordinary garbage dump.
Never mind that...
How dare you plunge me in here!
You'll pay!
Woah!
You made yourself fall!
Shut up!
Stop!
Running again?
!
I'm running!
Kuchiki?
Yeah.
That Kyokushu?
What do you guys want with somebody like her?
We came to save her.
Haah?
!
S-Save her...?
How many of you came?
!
At least 7 or 8, right?
No...
Five humans and one animal.
What?
One animal...?
You seriously intend to rescue her with so few?
!
That's right!
Y-You'll never pull off something like that!
Are you stupid, or something?
!
I-I laughed so hard, my wound opened up!
I dunno who's the stupid one.
Ahh.
Well, all right...
Directly south from here are the stations for each of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads...
H-Huh?
You're going to tell me?
Shut up!
Just listen!
Or I won't tell you!
At the west end of the stations is a white tower.
She should be there...
I-Is that true?
You're doubting me?
!
I have no interest in whatever you want with the girl.
Save her, if that's what you want.
Hey, get going, or other Reapers will find you!
Go, if you're going!
Oh... yeah...
So long.
I owe you, lkkaku.
Don't.
It's annoying.
Wait a minute.
Can I ask you something?
Who's the strongest in your group?
It's me, probably...
Is that so...?
Watch out for my captain, then.
Captain has no interest in weak men.
If what you say is true, you're the one he'll be after!
He's strong?
Meet him, and you'll find out...
How strong he is.
That is, if you stay alive long enough when you meet.
What's his name...?
!
Captain of the Squad 11, Kenpachi Zaraki.
Crap.
Another dead end?
!
You were the first in pursuit.
You have no sense of direction!
Fool!
We're stuck because I trusted in your so called "intuition"!
Never mind!
Let's move on.
Aye, aye, sir!
I looked up into the night sky and saw a comet
I want to see you right now, but I can't fly
If I could become a comet
I would fly across the sky...
I'm sure
I would circle the skies and shine over you
With this instantaneous light that will definitely reach you
If I could become a comet
I'm sure I'll alway stay close to you
Now and forever
No sense of fashion!
None!
I've always wondered...
Are Soul Reapers happy with their look?
I can't understand it!
That's why I despise Soul Reapers.
Ishida, the Soul Reapers are still your enemies, aren't they?
That's the reason?
!

Rukia's the only relative she has left.
Daddy!
Please let her stay with us!
This heart-wrenching story's like something straight out of a movie!
Yuzu!
I'd still let her stay even if her story wasn't ready-made for Hollywood!
Why do I get the feeling I've seen this all before?
feel free to ask.
What's a movie?
Of all the things... the bliss of having four daughters all of a sudden!
my dear!
Harem" and "daughter" never belong in the same sentence.
but don't stress over it.
Thanks.
we're going shopping.
Call us if anything happens.
Dad!
Yeah!
Put your shoes on first!
I forgot!
What is it?
Something up?
not really.
Another one?
How many does that make today?
you stay here and watch TV or something.
swap with me!
Y-Yeah.
Hey!
Inoue-san.
Chad.
What are you up to?
nothing really...
Is Nozomi-chan in?
Y-Yeah.
so it'd be good if you could keep her company.
I wonder what's wrong with Kon-chan... what became of them?
Sir.
All communication with the captains has been cut off.
I will rule Soul Society by means of my invading army!
I have merely been restricting the reigai's power until now!
bear witness to their true strength!
Please wait!
the Gotei 13 is doomed to certain collapse.
you should withdraw and reassess the situation. we do not know how reliable Urahara Kisuke's transmissions are.
Seek not to comfort me. as well as Kurosaki Ichigo and his allies.
We must not waste a single second in preparing for the invading army's assault.
sir.
One other matter - it would seem that Hollows are appearing in unusually large numbers. the emergence of a multitude of Hollows is inevitable.
that which we feared has come to pass.
We will deal with them using all the power we can deploy. but beware of leaving an opening for Kagerouza's invading army in the process.
sir.
Hold your tongue.
As you say.
done already?
are you feeling better?
Who do you think you're talking to?
how's that mod soul girl doing?
Well... not that I blame her.
is something wrong?
The very first mod soul.
That's who I am.
What should I say to her next time I see her?
it's part of our promotion.
it's part of our promotion.
What's this?
Looks like a dud.
it's creepy.
don't bother making one in the first place.
Where've you been?
My bad.
I've been stuck in Shinigami form all this time because you weren't around.
Get back in there.
R-Right.
How do I use this?
the spicy mayonnaise?
Just put it inside the chocolate like normal.
Inoue.
Kujou-san's presence?
Yeah.
Don't pretend you haven't noticed.
so I knew something about her was odd.
And then there was the time she healed Kurosaki-san's injuries.
That was when I pretty much confirmed that she was a mod soul.
but was clearly a different ability.
I concluded that her ability was artificially created.
that of a mod soul.
we do have one great mystery left to solve.
I look forward to demonstrating my true power to you all once I've reclaimed Nozomi.
I suspect.
Yes.
Lunch is served!
The deluxe Orihime Choconomiyaki!
Choconomi... yaki?
or an Okonomiyaki dish?
I'd call it... yakisoba noodles in a starchy sauce!
So it's none of the above?
!
How is it?
Good.
Really?
Hooray!
please come and make dinner for us too.
is that OK?
it's OK!
I'll be everybody's dad!
you old pervert!
It hurts!
Eat this!
Choconomiyaki!
Aargh!
Yo.
Yeah.
come on!
They're calling you.
What are you so concerned about?
Did I not tell you?
All is proceeding in accordance with my predictions.
Is it Nozomi?
That is only a matter of time.
No... it is all right...
The raw materials are no fools.
But this level of injury is within my expectations.
I shall ensure that your heart's desire is revealed unto the world!
What's with the gloom?
!
Stop it!
This ain't me!
What are you screaming your head off about?
Nee-san!
Nee-san!
Punch me out!
Feel better?
I...
I only asked for a punch... everyone can collect a "Larger-than-Life Lion" as a free gift at the front counter!
I'm the greatest!
Raargh!
Nozomi!
What's up?
Nothing much.
I was just looking around.
Thanks for waiting!
I've got everything we need for dinner!
time to head back.
Ichigo.
another one?
I'll be right back.
Shall I help?
No need!
Damn it!
Where's Rukia when you need her?
Get down!
Are you all right?
Ishida.
I owe you one.
What do you think you're doing?
You're lucky that I happened to be passing by this time... right?
yeah.
do you want to come over for dinner tonight?
Where'd that come from?
You're creeping me out.
Inoue's cooking.
Also...
Kon's been... kind of...
Acting strangely?
but it does seem like the life's been sucked out of him.
too.
It's difficult for him to carry on like before.
That's why I figured it'd be nice to have some fun around the place.
I didn't realize you thought about these things so much.
Just how insensitive do you think I am?
!
Inoue-san!
Such food!
You're a genuis!
you think so?
Onii-chan's kinda energetic.
You mean weird.
really?
this is new-
Four-Eyes!
Are you eating properly?
now would you?
I wouldn't mind him having a little less life in him right now...
Nozomi!
Are you eating lots?
you'll never grow up!
Especially your breasts!
sorry!
That was totally out of line.
Weird's the word.
Is he hitting puberty late?
This is the best fried seafood ever!
Where's Kurosaki?
This spicy tingling on my tongue is just amazing!
And this sauce is just too good to be true!
Question her?
What do you mean?
Why is Kagerouza so desperate to capture her?
What is the nature of the threat?
don't you think?
and neither do you.
We can't let a lack of information lead to more victims... that's the gist of it.
This isn't just our private opinion.
We're speaking as the survivors of the Gotei 13.
Don't take it the wrong way.
You might be right.
Still...
She's clearly got some stuff she's not ready to face.
I'm going to protect her.
Isn't that enough?
Now's not the time for noble words like that!
but the fact is that the invading army has devastated the Gotei 13.
That's the kind of enemy we're going to have to face here in Karakura Town.
It might not be just you or us that get hurt.
though.
Ironic?
Project Spearhead was originally a plan meant to reduce Shinigami casualties.
lots of us Shinigami have been injured and taken out to protect that mod soul kid.
Ironic to say the least.
That may be true.
don't those guys have the same right to live as the rest of us?
That's how it is?
You mean we mod souls were created by that bastard?
!
I see why you can't trust me if that's true.
that's not true!
Then what is?
!
I guess all I was to you in the end was another one of Kagerouza's creations!
Kagerouza wasn't the one who created you.
The very first mod soul.
That's who I am.
That idiot!
lots of us Shinigami have been injured and taken out to protect that mod soul kid.
Ironic to say the least.
but you're no use to anyone.
Just like me.
A Hollow!
If only I didn't exist... they'd all be safe...
You've got lots of reasons to live!
Kon... get up!
Good!
Now run as fast as you can!
Stop!
I want to protect people too!
I want to be useful too!
I want to help them all!
Huh?
You've got one...
I've got one...
I thought you didn't have a Zanpakutou?
So did I... what are you doing wandering around so late at night?
I'm just a burden.
Hey... don't start that again...
That's not what I'm saying.
Everyone's been trying to protect me.
But there's nothing I can do.
when I felt I wanted to protect you...
Even I got a sword.
What?
That's right!
What was I worrying about?
Why was I freaking out over what to say?
you've got to live on!
Yeah... huh?
What's that doing there?
I recognize that!
Could it be that you want one?
then.
Really?
Yeah.
Except...
It's defective.
The mane came off...
I prefer it that way.
That'll do.
you're such a kid!
pervert!

Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
One, two...
The sound resonates Into my heart, so hard and deep
A field of stars spans endlessly And through it I carve a passageway
In step with time as generations change
Close your eyes and listen closely
Shooting stars stream on silently...
until the goodbye
Keep the light inside of you, never give up don't ever lose
Transcend time and you will prove, there is a special place for you
A blaze of glory is there,
It's all a part of our estate, life is our story to create
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light Throughout the age, never fade away
A secret fire, a scream of light, voices calling through twilight
Cast your thoughts to the wind, hang your wishes on the moon
Live your life with all your strength for dreams will reach you very soon
Raise your eyes you can see shooting stars up in the night sky
Wishes speak from ages old by voice of light
Throughout the age, never fade away
Someday your dream will find its place somewhere
Keep shining like a star
Where the hell are those guys?
!
Ichigo!
Kon!
Where the hell were you?
!
What're you talking about?
You're the one who took off without us!
Hey, do you know where Yuzu and Karin are?
Don't worry, they're back at home.
I just saw them there.
Really?
And you?
Where were you looking all this time?
Good, now I can go look for Ishida!
Take care of my kid sisters!
Ishida!
Sheesh!
If I knew they'd make us help clean up,
I wouldn't have come to see.
Instead of lecturing us, make the ones responsible do this!
It's because you made such a fuss.
What about you?
!
What?
!
What?
But all of them were acting strange.
Huh?
What's Hime doing?
Hime!
If you stand there looking so cute and spaced out...
I'll kiss you!
What the hell are you blurting out all of a sudden?
!
- What?
- What?
!
U-Umm...
There's a TV show I want to watch, so let's call it a day and go home.
Huh?
Hurry, hurry.
Tatsuki, you too.
H-Hey, Orihime!
Please... hurry!
Let's go!
The first thing I thought was, "I wish I didn't notice."
Then I thought, "We have to get away from here."
One thing I know for sure...
that thing is dangerous.
Every cell in my body is tingling, trying to tell me... to run away!
Don't create a panic, and keep looking calm as though nothing is wrong.
Come on, you two!
Hurry!
Huh?
It disappeared.
I'm sorry, Orihime.
I have to change, so you two go on ahead.
Wait, Tatsuki!
I'll catch up in no time!
No, it disappeared!
Tatsuki, um!
You can see me, can't you?
Damn!
Damn!
Damn!
Damn!
Dammit!
Ishida!
20!
Sensei, this is for you, too...
I will... win!
What's the matter, Hime?
Is there something up there?
Run...
What?
Please run, Chizuru!
Hurry!
I won't let you get away.
What's happening?
!
Not the windows again?
!
Hime, are you all right?
Chizuru!
Chizuru!
Ohhh!
What'll I do?
!
Chizuru!
Oweee!
What?
Shedding tears?
So cute...
Geez, I don't know what happened, but I seem to be fine.
Okay?
But...
I'm fine.
Though I do like your crying face...
I prefer your smiling face.
Huh?
C-Chizuru!
W-What?
!
My hand is acting on its own!
No!
Why's this happening?
!
What's going on?
!
What's going on anyway?
!
What's happening?
!
What did you do to Chizuru?
!
Hime?
Hmm...
I just used a little of my power.
Power?
I don't like violence.
That's why I use these seeds from my forehead to take control of others.
And make you humans fight amongst yourselves.
That's!
Now, everyone, let us start!
What?
!
What's going on?
What's?
What's happening?
!
What the hell are you doing?
!
Take that!
Tatsuki!
Sorry, Orihime.
I didn't notice it earlier.
That thing over there.
So you can see it, too, Tatsuki?
I can't see it.
But I know where it is.
Where the thing that made you cry is.
Hey, you big blob over there!
You picked a fight with the wrong person!
It's been this way for a long time... that anyone who makes Orihime cry, will get it from me!
Move!
Next!
Next!
Next!
Next!
Hah!
You're all such wimps!
Get your hands off me!
Get away, Tatsuki...
Chizuru!
S-Something's happened to me!
Tatsuki!
How do you feel?
The seed I shot into you will soon take root and control your body.
In other words, your body is mine to manipulate.
Now cry.
Shut up!
What?
!
I said, shut up!
Let go of Orihime!
Huh?
Do you realize the position you're in right now?
You have almost no control of your body.
See?
How's that?
Huh?
Huh?
What are you doing?
!
Let go!
Let go!
I said, let go!
I have no need for you!
Die!
Tatsuki!
O-Orihime... don't cry, Ori...
Orihime, you have such pretty hair.
It's a nice, warm color.
What's with that hair?
You're such a show off!
Nooo!
Why did you cut your hair, Orihime?
I just felt like it.
Why're you spacing out like that?
Huh?
Come on, let's go home.
All right.
It's because of you that I was able to grow my hair long again.
I'll never cut my hair short again.
That's because this long hair is proof of my trust in you, Tatsuki.
Thank you...
for protecting me until now.
So please...
Don't cry!
Ori... hime...
Tatsuki, this time, I'll protect you.
What?
!
Tatsuki said, "You picked a fight with the wrong person."
But that's not it.
You picked the wrong person to hurt!
I will not forgive anyone who hurts Tatsuki!
J-Just what are you?
!
Using strange powers...
What is that?
Huh?
What?
!
What?
You didn't notice us?
No, she noticed us...
that we exist.
Huh?
After all, we've always been the closest to you.
Huh?
Hello...
Orihime.
H-Huh?
!
We are the Shunshun Rikka- The Six Princess-Shielding Flowers
We were born in order to protect you.
We are your powers.
Oh...
Fairies!
Airborne fairies are talking to me!
That's a cute reaction.
But we're not fairies.
Huh?
Like I said, we are the powers inside your soul.
We are a part of you.
Furthermore, only you can see us.
Oh, although... people like Ichigo Kurosaki can probably see us.
Kurosaki?
Why?
Well, it's because of him that we were born.
Huh?
You talk too much!
Hey woman...
You don't need to understand who we are or where we came from.
You seem so arrogant...
even though you're so small.
Shut up!
In any case, learn how to use us right now!
Use?
Yes!
Our power can put up a "shield" to reject.
In order to activate it, you must use your "heart" and your "Kotodama
- Spirit Chant."
K-Kotodama?
Hold it!
It's coming!
What've you been mumbling about over there?
Huh, young girl?
Huh?
!
Let's do it, Orihime!
Call our names!
I'm Hinagiku!
I'm Baigon!
I'm Lily!
Huh?
Huh?
!
Stay calm.
You must summon them with your Kotodama.
Repeat after me.
Hinagiku, Baigon, Lily!
Hurry!
Hinagiku, Baigon, Lily!
Santen Kesshun!
I reject!
Santen Kesshun!
I reject!
What?
!
Huh?
!
Their power rejects what is "outside the shield."
They put up a shield between you and your enemy, and reject any attacks directed at you.
And... our power is to reject what is "within the shield."
We make a limited space with our shield and we can reverse any damage that has been inflicted inside the space.
Now say our names.
I am Shuno!
I'm Ayame!
Shuno, Ayame!
Then recite the Kotodama.
Soten Kishun!
I reject!
Tatsuki...
Woman!
There's no time for tears!
I'm up next.
Huh?
My power is to reject what is on either side of the shield.
I put up a shield inside the enemy, and reject his material bonds.
In other words, I can cut the enemy in half.
Now say it!
My name is Tsubaki!
Tsubaki!
Koten Zanshun!
I reject!
Ridiculous!
I did it!
Orihime!
- Orihime!
- Orihime!
Oh dear...
I guess using all of us so soon was too much for her.
But, Orihime really did well.
Huh?
!
The man's not here.
Are you sure this is the place?
I'm sure of it.
The man was beaten up and lying here...
Hey Karin!
Liar!
I'm not a liar!
He really WAS hurt and...
Say no more, Karin.
Father understands.
I've been so busy lately, and have had no time for you.
That you would go so far as to lie to get attention from your father...
Now Karin...
jump into my arms!
Come hug me as hard as you can!
Huh?
!
Shut up, idiot.
Let's just go home.
This place gives me a weird feeling.
Owwee!
You're hopeless.
So all's well here.
Good.
URAHARA STORE
Huh?
Chad?
You're up?
Good morning.
Good morning.
Um... where is this place?
Dunno...
Oh, you're up at last.
Who is that?
I don't know.
But... it seems we were saved by him.
Correct.
Now then, where to begin?
Dammit!
That Ishida!
I'm definitely going to make him cry!
I'm not able to kill in one shot now.
But what's going on?
There're far too many for that small amount of bait.
It's as though they were lured by an even greater force.
But it doesn't matter.
Sensei, I swear I will avenge your death.
Path of Destruction Four:
Byaku Rai!
Damn!
These Hollows are small fry!
If I can't even beat these Hollows, does it mean my powers haven't returned at all?
Is that Ichigo?
!
How I longed to see you, Sis!
You're Kon, aren't you?
!
It feels so good to get kicked like this, too.
Don't be an idiot!
But if you're in Ichigo's body, that means he transformed into a Soul Reaper, right?
Err...
Sis, behind you...
Huh?
!
Good, you seem okay, too.
Rukia Kuchiki.
It's my first time speaking to you face to face.
Totally ignored.
I get it now.
So this is your doing?
Absolutely.
This is a battle between me and the Soul Reaper.
What?
But I won't let anyone in town die.
Even if Ichigo Kurosaki is defeated,
I will give my life to protect the people of this town.
He, the Soul Reaper, will watch me as I protect everything and everyone from the Hollows.
If I cannot do that... this battle is meaningless.
What the hell do you?
Just a minute.
Y-Yes, all this about Soul Reapers and Hollows... it's so sudden.
Then will you deny the fact that you were attacked earlier?
Well...
Ichigo Kurosaki is fighting Hollows as a Soul Reaper as we speak.
And the strong spiritual energy that he released has influenced you.
That's what it means.
However, it's all up to you, whether you open the gate that has appeared before you or not.
Boss...
The Sky Ridge has begun to converge.
And the preparations?
All set.
Well then, let's go.
Will you come?
I shall show you...
what is beyond the gate.
I found you...
Ishida!
Kurosaki!
Ichigo!
Though the voyage must continue on
May seas always be calm
When the cycle of the moon has renewed may it shine
It's light to guide your boat
I offer this voyage a prayer
With each new day that still awaits
On vividly shining seas
To the end of the journey
Time for Isshin Kurosaki's Fatherly Love 101!
Now everyone, all together...
A father's love is strong!
A father's love will win!
A father's love is beautiful!
A father's love is-!
How many times must I tell you, this is a preview!
The next episode... is great.
Pain that won't heal
Sadness you feel
Scars that just refuse to fade from memory
Sometimes the burden's too much for one to bear
Don't give up on me, please don't turn me away
Whoa!
I'll hold your hand in mine
Will I lose my hold on her someday?
Will her smile fade in a flood of tears Or can I keep the fears at bay?
Echoing, distant voices wither into silence.
But there is one thing that will never ever age...
My love for you is timeless
Pain that won't heal
Sadness you feel
Smiles with hearts' bitterness replaced
"I'll never smile again"
"I'll never let love in"
Don't ever say such things to me
A future we cannot see
All happenings Find meaning in the story
In time the clouds will clear away, so just stay, please stay with me...
Whoa!
Who are we to pass through you?
Whoa!
That answer will find you someday
Dammit!
Where the heck has Ganju run off to?
Ikkaku said the one chasing Ganju was the 5th seat of Squad 11...
His name was...
It was...
It...was...
Huh?
Well, never mind.
That means he's the 5th strongest from the Captain on down.
I gotta rescue Ganju.
He probably can't manage on his own.
There're nothing but these same walls all over the place!
I'm getting mad!
Hey!
Ganju!
Where the hell are you?
!
If you can hear me, send up some fireworks to let me know!
You dimwit!
Rats!
I gave myself away.
There's one!
The orange haired Soul Reaper!
You're not getting away!
Kill 'im!
For the glory of Zaraki Squad, even if it means death!
He's getting away!
After him!
- Bastard!
Stop!
- Give up, orange head!
Your luck ran out when you met me!
This means a promotion!
Dammit!
Ganju!
Where are you?
!
A hole...?
A hole!
Dammit!
Another hole?
!
How many are there, anyway?
It's the last hole.
For you, anyhow.
Whaddya mean, the "last hole"?
!
You'll never convince me of that!
I'm getting away from you.
Even if I have to fall into a hole!
Would you like to try?
I didn't tell you, but...
The bottom of the hole is surrounded by Sekki-Seki.
In other words, they completely block spiritual powers.
Now you know, don't you?
Why no one who falls in can ever get out again?
Ow...!
I see the damage I inflicted is still there, after all...
Well, you've managed to elude me all this time, even though wounded.
I suppose I should commend you for coming so far, as ugly as you are.
You really make me sick!
Bastard!
I make you sick?
That can't be helped.
Ugly ones envy the beautiful.
It's only natural.
Hey, Ganju!
Halt!
Filthy Ryoka!
Is that your comrade making all that racket?
He's been calling your name all this time.
Halt, I say!
Bow to your fate!
Damn!
They sure are persistent!
Ganju!
Ganju!
Your friend behaves in the same ugly manner as you.
It will only summon a never ending horde of Soul Reapers.
Really...
It's difficult to understand his lack of good sense.
Ain't you the one without good sense?
Huh?
Ichigo is there because...
He defeated your bald headed partner.
T That can't be!
Our Squad 11 is the best combat unit of the 13 Court Guard Squads!
Ikkaku is our 3rd best fighter!
How could your man defeat him?
!
Your only strong skill is seeing openings!
You ain't seen nothing yet!
Shiba Style...
Battle Level Shooting Flower!
Senpen Banka!
Don't underestimate me!
You call that a skill?
!
How dare you...?
My face, how dare you...?
!
Now you look more like a man!
No finesse.
You probably mean to use your one strange skill to collapse the ground, and kill us both.
Huh!
Me, die with you?
I'd never die so wastefully!
Silence!
You're a tough bastard.
For all this time you've run from me, enduring my attacks, and yet you still can move.
I marvel at your physical strength.
Just a while longer...
Just a little while longer...
He still underestimates my power.
The only time to use the Seppa is now, while his guard is down!
Truly...
That alone is regrettable.
If you had been born beautiful...
You would have been my very favorite...
I can't dodge him!
What's wrong?
Can't you use that floating technique anymore?
Ugly...
What good is it for an ugly one to persist in living?
If one is born ugly, he should at least die beautifully.
I disagree.
It seems our ideas of aesthetics are completely different.
I was taught that, ugly or not, the one who survives is the finest!
What?
!
Bastard!
You dare lay your ugly hand on my head...!
It helped that you underestimated me to the last.
Now for the finish!
Shiba Style Rock Wave Secret Move!
Renkan Seppa Sen!
W-What the...?
!
Dammit!
You can't finish me with this puny attack!
Don't make me laugh!
Where are you?
!
Where?
!
H-Hey!
Take this!
What's this...?
It's a bomb!
Noo!
What the heck.
He's over there?
It's a little late for that.
Shut up.
Hey, they're close!
But... it's not this way, is it?
Since it's a dead end.
Shouldn't we have turned right at the last corner?
You're the one who said to come this way!
Oh, Kenny!
You shouldn't blame others!
Wasn't I close?
There, go there!
This way, right?
Yep!
- They're gone, aren't they?
- Yes...
He seemed terribly strong.
It's lucky that he didn't see us, isn't it?
Yes.
He must be the same type as Kurosaki.
He has awesome power, but poor detection abilities.
Now...
We changed sites, but where should we go from here?
How about that way?
I see a tower off in the distance...
Tower?
Where?
Look, over there.
Didn't touch her...
To escape from such close range...
Very good.
Magnificent!
If you had met anyone but me, you might have lived a little longer.
Lament!
I'll count to ten to give you time to lament.
One...
I sense the collision of Spirit Pressure here and there.
Don't die, my friends.
Live!
One...
Two...
- Oh... thank you.
I'm all right, Ishida.
- Three...
Four...
Yes...you are.
Five...
- He's not the same Ishida as a while ago.
- Six...
- He moved so quickly.
- Seven...
For a split second, Ishida vanished from my consciousness...
Then I was saved before I realized.
Such a transformation at the mere sight of a Soul Reaper.
It's just as Yoruichi said.
Ishida is a Quincy.
Even now, Soul Reapers are enemies to him.
Ten!
Now, your time for lamentation is over.
Have you done it to your satisfaction?
He's coming!
Right!
Now comes another time for lamentation.
Come, Soul Reaper!
I'm the one you'll fight!
It is not you who decides who will fight!
Now, I shall end your lamentation.
With your death...
Ms. Inoue!
Run!
No, I mustn't run.
I've got to fight and save Kurosaki!
Tsubaki!
At last, it's show time.
Aim well!
Koten Zanshun! "I reject!"
Tsubaki!
Fool...
Faltering like that...!
Tsubaki...
That was the first time I saw that technique.
There's no intent to kill in your attack.
Though you might kill Hollows with that move, it will have no effect on Soul Reapers.
M-My body won't move...
This is a battleground!
Without the intent to kill, you'll never stop anyone!
Wha?
!
So you want an attack with intent to kill?
Then fight me.
It's here in my bow...
The intent to kill you love so much.
Hanataro...!
What do you want?
This is no place for your kind!
Be gone!
We never sent for anyone from Squad 4!
Uh...
I used to do the cleaning when she was in Squad 6 barracks' prison.
I thought the Shishinro might need some cleaning, too...
The Shishinro can't be opened for anyone until the sentence is carried out!
Don't you even know that?
!
Beat it, beat it!
Oh, but...
Beat it, or I'll hack you to pieces!
Y-Yes, sir...
What's wrong?
!
Scared?
You can't get away, Ryoka!
- You'll get us a special promotion!
- Rats!
I'm surrounded!
- There's no way out!
- Geez!
I let up a little, and it goes to their heads!
Anyhow, what should I do?
Men!
Kill 'im!
I'm g-getting crushed!
Cut it out, bastards!
So I can run!
He's off again!
Get 'im!
How many are there, anyway?
!
Hmm ...
Very interesting.
Would you be a Quincy?
That's right.
Ishida's bow...
It's totally different from the one I saw!
In its appearance and even in its spiritual pressure...!
That glove...
He must have been practicing in order to use it properly.
Learning to use it...
Practicing all alone...
This is interesting.
One uses an unfamiliar skill;
the other is a Quincy.
And both employ projectile weapons.
And you've both come to fight me.
What coincidence!
What a twist of fate.
Now I must show you.
The true form of my Zanpaku-to
Spread your wings!
Tsunzaki Garasu!
What do you think?
Now, lament.
I am 4th Seat of Squad 7!
Jirobo lkkanzaka!
Also known as Jirobo Wind Sythe!
The nickname, Wind Sythe, proves that
I am the most skilled in projectile weapons.
My countless blades dance through space.
No one has seen my Tsunzaki Garasu and lived!
Here, here.
How do you like it?
You can't even follow them with your eyes, can you?
They're the prelude to a brilliant death.
Before Tsunzaki Garasu, your bow and arrows are as helpless as a baby!
As a fellow master of flying weapons, you'll fully regret having met me...
Huh?
!
How interesting.
Unlike the outside world... here, the strongest fighter seems to be the most long winded whiner.
Ridiculous!
That was a fluke!
Don't be so cocky.
You still don't understand?
Sorry, but if you're supposed to be the strongest,
I take back your nickname as of today.
Where flying weapons are concerned, I seem to be the better man.
The name, "Uryu Weasel with Scythe," though, doesn't sound all too cool.
You men search over there.
If you find them, take them alive.
They might make interesting research specimens.
Don't let the other Squads capture them first.
- Yes, sir!
- Go!
Hmph!
They're only humans, though.
I don't expect very good specimens.
Hell Butterfly?
What's the message, Nemu?
Yes, sir...
Ikkaku Madarame of Squad 11 encountered and fought a Ryoka.
What?
!
So the Squad 11 already has a Ryoka?
No, Ikkaku was beaten by the Ryoka and taken to the Squad 4 General Relief Station.
The Ryoka escaped and his whereabouts remain unknown.
Defeated by a Ryoka?
My my...
Among the Ryoka, there seem to be quite interesting subjects.
Where's Zaraki?
Searching for Ryoka, sir.
Then he wouldn't know about this yet.
Well, before he gets wind of it, let's get the info on Ryoka.
Lord Mayuri, where are you going?
To see Ikkaku.
How slow you are to guess.
Come along, dullard.
I sense Zaraki's Spiritual Pressure.
So he's on the move...
Ichigo...
Be careful!
- Get him!
- There!
I looked up into the night sky and saw a comet
I want to see you right now, but I can't fly
If I could become a comet
I would fly across the sky...
I'm sure
I would circle the skies and shine over you
With this instantaneous light that will definitely reach you
If I could become a comet
I'm sure I'll alway stay close to you
Now and forever
We're surrounded!
So many Soul Reapers!
We've got to find someplace to hide!
We need a plan to outwit the enemy!
Just blast them with an attack right through the middle!
Okay, you go.
- You go.
- You go.
Go, Ganju!
Uh, I've got piano practice...
Adam's all "ooh!" About Iris, and Luke, who I can always count on to be more pathetic than me, has hooked up with Glynis, shining a big spotlight on what a total washout I am.
If I was a Viking, they'd put me on a flaming raft and send me out to sea.
You did the history reading.
That's how desperate I am.
That thing with Rove is not gonna last.
Oh, why?
Are his lips gonna fall off from making out too much?
I was trying to be positive.
It's not me.
Rove and Iris are perfect for each other.
They'll probably have a house full of emotionally damaged babies by senior year.
So where do I fit in?
You don't.
Isn't that how this whole conversation got started?
Why do I always wanna punch street performers?
I guess it's clown trauma.
Why did we stop?
We should be fleeing in horror.
It's bad enough we had to come all the way downtown to the library to research Viking footwear.
I kinda like this song.
I'm not gonna stay for this, Girardi, no matter what kind of breakdown you're having.
Then just go.
I'll catch up with you.
You suck, dude.
That was really humiliating.
God should know how to carry a tune.
You seem awfully high-strung these days, Joan.
You need to lighten up, baby.
Please, not another song.
Please?
I want you to learn how to jump rope.
I know how to jump rope.
I used to do it when I was a little kid.
Remember?
Yeah, and didn't you enjoy it?
The freedom, the joy, man.
That perfect synchronicity between jumper and rope.
Casper, Casper, why you bugging?
Your dads gone and you're left jumping' Jump!
Jump!
Mama Mama, took me to the park.
Sun went down and it got dark...
You're kidding me, right?
Was one of us?
Like one of us
Grace was right.
You do suck.
Casper, Casper, why you bugging?
Youre Dads gone and you're left jumping' Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
The sun went down and it got Dark.
It got cold and so we jumped.
Why you bugging?
Youre dad is gone and you're left jumping' Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
What are you looking at?
Uh, you.
Um, that was amazing.
How do you do that?
You think I look like some kind of teacher?
No.
No, you don't.
Well, I just thought that, maybe, you know, I could try.
You need skills to jump with this crew.
Oh, I got skills.
I got mad skills.
Well, not mad.
More like loopy, loopy.
Yo, Maliya.
Nikki.
Give girlfriend here a turn.
Ok.
Um, sorry, guys.
Maybe you could slow it down just a little bit.
I'm a little rusty.
Um, guys, just-- you said you wanted to jump.
Jump!
You said you had skills.
You lied.
You pushed me.
Buh-bye.
Casper, Casper why you bugging?
Snow white tried to jump with me
Casper, Casper, where'd she go?
home cause the sad girl hit the flo'
Where are you off to?
Oh, follow-up on a case.
I've spent 3 weeks on desk duty reviewing cold cases.
I could use a fresh taste.
Charles Timmons. 53.
Someone didn't like Charles.
He owned a fabric store on Brookview.
His wife got home from her book club, found him in the kitchen, single shot to the back of the head.
Jewellery, silver gone.
No forced entry, no prints, no witnesses.
Was he mixed up in anything?
Oh, yeah.
He started a camp for kids with cancer, sponsored a little league team, been married 26 years.
Well, it's always the quiet ones you have to worry about.
Hey, you wanna trade?
You work these dead ends.
I'll take that one?
Soon, Will, soon.
Oh, doc.
You makin' house calls now?
I had a psych consult down at the jail.
Thought I'd just stop by, check in.
I better run.
Oh, maybe you should wait.
I might be getting my gun back.
We'll grab some lunch later.
Sure.
Look, I'm grateful for all your help.
I needed it, but now I need to get back out there.
I know.
Will, look, we had a deal.
Now, Thursday is "bring your kid to work" day, and you haven't signed up yet.
You think I want my kids to see me shuffling papers?
I'm a cop, Henry.
If I had my piece back, could work the field--
Will, what you're going through here, post traumatic stress, it comes with the job.
It is nothing to be ashamed of.
And being able to let your family go through that with you-- even the kids-- it's the best medicine.
So this is a test, right?
To see how solid I am.
You pulled your gun on a 4-year-old.
You want to go back on the street worried that you could melt down again?
Hey, what happened?
Where you been?
Remember before how I said I hit bottom?
Yeah.
There was further to go.
Cool.
I just wanted to learn how to jump rope from these girls in the park, and they totally dissed me, and they shoved me-- whoa, whoa, and whoa.
Jump rope?
Yeah.
Jump rope?
Yes.
It's something I have to do.
It was very important.
Why?
How am I supposed to know?
And still I fall.
Jane.
Grace.
What do you think?
I made it for your mom's class.
It's awesome, right? "A" is so talented.
"A"?
Youre calling him A now.
Is that a problem?
No!
no, Its cute.
Well, I think your mom's gonna be blown away, don't you?
We better get going A
Yeah.
Uh, later.
"A"?
Isn't that just wrong?
He's not that into her.
Trust me.
Hes Hot for someone else.
Who?
Your mom.
Sorry, dude.
Give it a rest, horndog!
Did you enjoy yourself this morning, Joan?
Bite me, big bird.
You almost got me killed.
You seem fine to me.
Do you hate me or something?
Me?
Hey, I'm all about love.
Yeah, I can see.
Glynis and Luke, Adam and Iris, Adam and my mom.
You are seriously twisted.
You're feeling alone.
You envy their connections.
Oh, and you have to be God to figure that out?
Go back to the park.
Wait, wait, wait.
Back to the psycho?
The one throwing out the seriously bad juju?
I asked you to jump.
All you've done so far is fall.
Go back and Jump, Joan.
Well, if you don't want me to feel so alone, then give me a boyfriend!
Interesting.
It's a naive piece.
Naive?
Like folk art.
It'S... oh, it's a turtle!
You're-- showing how you withdraw to protect yourself from the world.
It's a catalytic converter and an exhaust pipe.
You see yourself as a catalytic converter.
Youre showing how you convert your personality into what?
Help me out here, Adam.
I assigned a self-portrait.
How is this you?
It's not.
You didn't do the assignment?
He went in a different direction.
I have to do what I feel.
Oh.
We'll talk about this after class.
Why?
I thought this class was about sharing our thoughts, being honest.
Ok.
You are very talented, Adam, but you're coasting.
There's... no feeling in this.
I assigned a self-portrait because I wanted you to think introspectively.
You avoided that challenge.
This class is about discovery, getting in touch with who you are.
Real art, it-- it takes risks.
It creates a dialogue.
Do the assignment, Adam.
Take a risk.
Uncle Tim and Auntie Em, Yo took our possy to the rap show.
Outkast, Master, chillin' flava, Hey Ya, Hey, Ya, Hey, Ya.
snow white's back.
Better check yourself, yo.
I just want a chance to jump, to try.
So why don't you find someone your own speed at the playground?
With you.
Someone, wake this little sister up.
She's dreamin'.
That was amazing!
It was like being in an eggbeater!
I said no.
You don't belong here.
Chill, Casper.
She hung out and shes all right.
Double it up!
Don't get me tied in these ropes.
I won't like that.
I'm waitin'.
Don't look at my feet!
Look at my eyes.
Link eyes!
One foot!
Casper, see you tomorrow, girl?
Oh, I'll be here.
Wait, wait, wait.
You're stopping?
We just got started.
Cops shut the park down at sunset and they run everybody out.
You fixed for food?
Always.
You can eat at my house.
You think we friends now, princess?
You think we got something in common?
Well, we did when we were jumping.
Its like we were the same person in there.
Come on.
My mom always makes way too much food anyway.
Come on.
Michelle turner.
She's a violinist who developed musical therapy for autistic kids.
You want me to interview her?
Not an interview exactly, a profile.
It's more personal.
We'll get to know her through your eyes.
Which begs the question, why would anybody care about my eyes?
She's been working with disabled kids for years.
You'll be able to add a perspective nobody else can.
You're not giving this assignment to me because we're... you know?
No.
Not that it hurts, but, no.
I don't think I've seen you at school, Casper.
Do you go to Southside?
Yeah.
You're lucky.
You could have my mom for art.
Oh, by the way, mom, whatever you did to Adam today, he's, like, totally catatonic, so I hope that's what you were going for.
Yeah.
Well, my teaching methods are not open for discussion.
So, Casper, where did you and Joan meet?
The park.
Jumpin'.
Jumping?
Rope.
Double Dutch.
Casper's teaching me.
It should totally, like, be an Olympic event.
It's much cooler than twirling those ribbons.
What's up with that?
I smell garlic.
Before you launch into the embarrassing lecture on the health benefits of garlic, this is my friend Casper, and she doesn't care.
Nice to meet you.
It is a natural antibiotic, you know.
It also lowers blood pressure.
I love this kid.
Joan, Honey, I have a favour.
We're having "bring your kid to work" day at the office, and since Kevin is working, I thought-- no can do.
I already get enough parental bonding with mom.
Besides, Casper and I jump after school.
Jump?
Rope.
I can't explain.
I just have to, ok?
Ask Romeo.
Romeo?
It's a crude attempt at irony.
Ask me what?
Dad has to take a kid to work.
Kevin's got a job.
I have a life.
You're option "C."
That's not it at all.
I just thought that... well, you're gonna be bored hanging out with a bunch of cops.
No, I won't.
It sounds cool.
Oh.
Well...great.
So, anything I can help you with?
You know, I--I just remembered.
I have to run.
We're gonna eat in 2 minutes.
I've got homework.
You know, garlic helps increase the blood flow to the brain.
See you in the park, yo.
Mama, mama took me to the park, sun went down and it got dark.
It got cold and so we jump.
Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
Watch out for her, yo.
Her pops is 5-0.
What's up with you?
We're all hanging out, having a good time, and then you jet like some freak show.
Who do you think you are, girl?
Better step off.
It's cool.
Keep jumping'.
Look...
I had to go, all right?
Chill.
Chill?
Are you in some kind of trouble?
No!
Look, it was a mistake, me comin' over to your place.
Let's just roll back the clock.
You go back to your life, and I'll go back to mine.
What, here I'm, like, some embarrassment because you have to keep it real with your homies?
You think I'm frontin'?
Ok, princess, why don't you come to my house for dinner?
A shelter?
Yeah.
I keep it so real that I sleep there every night, me and my 50 crazy-ass homies.
Well, where's your family?
My mom took off when I was 9, and my dad's upstate lookin' for work.
Casper... you're my age.
You cant live in a shelter.
I mean, you-
- All right, ok, so you don't go to Southside, and you don't go to school at all, do you?
What are they gonna teach me?
Wait, wait, wait.
I can talk to my dad.
The cop?
Yeah.
He can help.
Why do you think I took off?
He'd call children's services, and they'd toss me in a group home.
Casper-- look, if you wanna help me, just stop comin' down here.
Go back to your castle, princess.
Without my brother's autism, I wouldn't have realized just how much my music could help someone.
Well, maybe if you play me something, I'd start dancing.
I'm good, but I don't know if I'm that good.
You're not what I expected.
You thought I'd be taller, right?
Well, I've--I've got everything I need.
Terrific.
So, what now?
I've got one night in Arcadia.
What should I do?
Check out Marvin's.
Home of the garlic cheeseburger.
Guaranteed to rock your world.
Mmm.
Ok.
Well, that sounds like an offer I can't refuse.
Oh, that--that wasn't an offer.
No, I-
- I should start writing.
Well, a man's gotta eat, right?
Arent you hungry.
I guess I could eat something.
Mom's working late again.
Can we order pizza?
Already on the way.
Extra garlic.
Call me when it comes.
I wanna finish this article about digital fingerprint filing.
He deals with some impressive technology.
I'm the guy who can't work the remote, remember?
You know, one good thing about mom's new job-- never-ending junk food.
You should support her, you know.
Hey, I'm doing my best.
Can you imagine if grandma was the chief of police?
How would you be coping?
Well, I wouldn't have to go see a shrink.
She'd just make me some manicotti and say, "Everything gonna be ok."
And how is everything?
Better.
Thanks.
I never knew before... all the things you keep locked up.
Yeah.
Well, doc says I'm gonna be back in the field real soon.
Well, that's good, yeah?
I'll get it.
Hi.
How much?
You got it pretty good here, don't you, Joan?
Don't you ever take a night off, watch TV?
You're right to worry about Casper.
Great.
It's not like there's anything I can do to help.
She's used to protecting herself.
Connecting with you is something she can't trust.
Find a way to let her know it's real.
How do I do that?
She keeps pushing me away.
$17.
That's right.
Mr. Mysterious ways doesn't give answers.
No, that would be too helpful.
No tip?
I got it here in under 30 minutes.
Ohh.
Like that's hard for you?
I was dating someone for a while, but I don't really like being tied down.
Otherwise, um, nights like this couldn't happen.
Are you actually blushing?
I'm sorry.
I'm--I'm... confused.
Are you really... hitting on you?
It was kind of obvious, wasn't it?
I just-- since the accident, there's only been... one person.
Just one?
Surprising, huh?
Because I'm smart and handsome.
And Modest.
And I always get the best parking spots.
Upper body strength.
It's the key to fitness and dating.
So toss that ball like your life really depends on it, 'cause it does.
She's homeless?
Grace, she sleeps in a shelter.
There are really creepy people there.
And the only reason she hangs out in the park all day is 'cause she has nowhere else to go.
I have to do something.
Look at my butt, Friedman, one more time.
I dare you.
You wish, Marge.
No lying down, Mr. Friedman.
All right, people, let's break up into pairs.
School will be like a wasteland with you gone for a whole day.
Steal a utility bill.
What?
For your friend.
A utility bill is all she needs to in roll in school.
She's off the streets, gets free food, can play with the medicine ball.
Thought you weren't interested in anyone but yourself.
This isn't about her.
It's political.
We're subverting the system, dude.
Ohh!
You'll be off the streets.
No cops will hassle you.
You'll get breakfast and lunch.
It kind of tastes like rubber-- school sucks.
Hey!
Normally, you'd be preaching to the choir, but look around you.
Do you wanna be hanging out with these people or kids your own age, kids like you?
There are kids like me that go to your school?
Casper, look, I--I know that it's hard to trust that someone like me isnt just doing some lame community service thing here, but you have to know I'm really here for you.
I--look!
I stole this gas bill and everything.
I'm looking at hard time for this.
I can't.
I have to be here when my dad comes back.
Casper... do you really even have a dad?
He looks nice.
This was our apartment.
We had a regular life before he got sick.
I had to take care of him.
There wasn't anyone else to.
But he's gonna take care of us again.
It's just hard starting' over.
Wouldn't he want you to be in school?
Here.
I brought you some clothes.
No one will know that you live here.
You'll be just another normal kid.
Well, when I say normal, I--I mean that you'll-- you'll look like me.
Not that that's exactly normal, but-- but it's the best that I can do.
Let's go jump.
Ok!
So, this is where the magic happends
Cool These are all cold cases?
How do you know about those?
I asked mom what you were working on.
You did?
They're all unsolved?
I mean, there's hundreds.
90% dead ends.
I leaf through them on a wing and a prayer.
Hey. you wanna see something cool?
Here's the real magician.
Captain, my captain.
You must be Luke.
Your dad tells me that you're quite the scientist.
Reggie runs the CSI.
Lab, things that spin and blink and whir.
You'd be in heaven.
We just installed a new processor for DNA analysis.
It's killer.
An automated genetic analyzer?
They use capillary electrophoresis, right?
Are you sure he's your kid?
I mean, I can run your DNA.
He gets the brains from his mom's side.
Hey, you wanna check it out?
It's like the bat cave down there.
Sure.
Aren't you coming?
Oh, you guys are out of my league.
All I'm doing is shuffling papers around here.
Go.
Enjoy yourself.
I did my self-portrait.
Like you said.
Took my risk.
Terrific.
Let's have a look.
What are you trying to say here?
You wanted me to look inside myself, so I did.
That's what was there.
Ok.
I'll mark the assignment complete.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do.
Ok, listen up, people.
This is Karen Casper.
Before I elevate your heart rates to something approaching healthy,
I want you all to welcome her.
I'll get your uniform.
Hi.
So, are gym clothes as lame as you remember?
Yeah.
Hey, Karen, was it?
I just wanted to make sure you knew that if you needed any help finding the girls' locker room, that's something I can-- this is Friedman.
You can step on him, its allowed.
Hey, Glynis.
Where'd you get that?
In the equipment bin.
I'm just trying to release a few Endorphins before class.
I miss Luke.
Hey, check it out.
What?
Look.
We can Dutch.
There's rope in here.
Does anyone know how to twirl?
Cool.
Perfect.
Come on.
No, not here.
Oh, come on!
Are you kidding me?
Show 'em what you got.
Casper, Casper, Why you buggin'?
Snow White wants to see you jumpin' come on.
Come on!
You buried the lead so deep a bloodhound couldn't find it.
So I'll fix it.
You can run it on the weekend.
Your descriptive powers were in full bloom, though.
Is this why you didn't come over last night, why you didn't even call?
Is that why you killed my piece?
I asked you first.
I didn't do anything wrong.
We haven't put any labels on this yet.
So you're saying that what happened between us, it didn't mean anything?
No, I'm not saying that.
I just-- she kept coming on to me!
Do you think that I want to hear this?
Im not your pal or your sister.
I felt like... a regular 19-year-old kid again.
I never thought I'd feel like that, so... it didn't mean anything.
It did to me.
Come on.
You know, maybe this is all my fault... for getting involved with a regular 19-year-old kid.
Ladies and gentlemen, the kid is back.
I got your shooter.
3 cold cases.
All older, wealthy victims, single shot to the head, Jewellery gone, no forced entry.
Sound familiar?
Yes!
And here's your link.
Henley motors?
A garage on the west side.
Each of the victims there had a tune-up there a week before their death.
Toni?
Timmons got his brakes fixed Friday.
Henley motors.
So you're saying we have a psycho mechanic on our hands?
Yep.
The same name on all the paperwork at Henley.
Charles Newcomb.
My guess is he chats up his customers, copies their keys, and then pays them a late-night visit.
Unbelievable.
Great work, will.
So, what do you say we go see this guy, partner, see if we've got some cuffs that'll fit him?
No, I can't let you do that, will.
But I cracked it.
It's my collar.
You're still not cleared.
You know that.
I'll make sure you get full credit, though.
Anyone missing a genius.
Hey, son.
You remember Detective Williams, Sheriff Roebuck.
Your old man just cracked 4 homicides.
3 years we've been running up against a wall, and he does it sitting at his desk.
Are you going to bring the guy in now?
They are.
It was an amazing piece of detective work, will.
You don't have to call anybody!
I'll just go.
Hey, hey, hey!
What's going on?
Your friend has enrolled in this school illegally.
The phone number that she gave us was out of service, and the account number on the utility bill was registered to your family, Ms. Girardi.
You have to do more than change the address to fool me.
Ok, ok!
I'll just leave!
Wait, ok?
The use of fraudulent documentation is a serious offence.
She just wanted to come to Arcadia because you run such a great school, Mr. Price.
That I know, but school zones exist for a reason.
Now I'm sorry, Ms. Casper, I'm gonna have to send you back to your district.
You can't!
She's-- care to elaborate, Joan?
Uh... no.
Look...
Casper, wait!
Come on.
Ms. Girardi.
Ms. Girardi.
Uh, I kind of freaked.
That was evident in your work.
I'm sorry.
I don't want an apology.
Your piece, it... hurt me...
Made me angry.
I hated it, actually, but it's what I asked you to do.
You wanted me to hurt you?
I wanted you to take a risk, to put yourself in your work, to create something that would make people think, would make them feel something, and that isn't always pleasant or pretty, but... it is art.
And maybe in the future I will be touched by... a stirring portrait of my nobility and charm.
Thanks.
I want to keep on pushing you because, um, that turtle?
Let's be honest.
Crap on a stick.
Mrs. Girardi, may I have a word with you, please?
I'm with a student, Mr. Price.
Not as a teacher, as a parent.
You met this girl in the park 3 days ago.
Now you're willing to get suspended to protect her?
You don't understand!
So explain it!
I can't!
You can, but you won't!
Mom--
I mean, if you're embarrassed to be with me, why did you even ask me to come?
Will
- I'm not embarrassed to be--Luke!
What happened?
I can't really say.
Oh!
How come he can get away with that?
Because he's confused.
You're lying.
Do I want to know about this?
Oh, you will.
So why is Luke so upset?
Apparently because I sent him off to the lab with the science guys.
I thought he'd like it, but he got all upset, saying I'm ashamed of him, that we don't spend any time together, That I dont know who he is.
Well, you don't.
Sorry.
He's my son.
I know my own son.
Oh.
Do you know he has a girlfriend?
Luke?
Look, dad, I don't blame you.
Luke is very weird-- hey, don't lecture me.
Aren't you the one who's in trouble here?
She used a fake utility bill to in roll her friend Casper in school, and, for some reason, she would rather get suspended than explain herself to Price.
Joan, I know you've had a hard time making friends.
Dad, I didn't do it because I need a friend.
I did it because she's all alone.
She's homeless, ok?
She lives in a really creepy shelter.
She's homeless?
Her dad isn't here so they could take her away from him.
Where's her dad?
Upstate looking for work.
She shouldn't have to lose her dad because their luck sucks.
I mean, the reason I jumped-
- I had to connect with her, which I did because of her eyes, you know-- she trusts me now!
I can't turn her in.
Well, I know the head of child protective services.
They can find her a good home until her dad gets back and they can sort things out.
And I have a friend who runs a jobs program.
You should've talked to us, honey.
We're on your side most of the time.
Well, your also a teacher and you're a cop.
My life would be a lot easier if you were just... normal loser parents.
You said she trusts you.
Talk to her first thing tomorrow.
Get her to call me.
Thanks, dad.
Hey.
What are you gonna do about brain boy?
Don't I even get a minute to enjoy my good deed?
All he wanted was to spend time with you.
The way Kevin always did, or...even me when you'd make me kick that stupid soccer ball until my foot fell off.
I thought you liked that.
Well, now you know.
Glynis.
His girlfriend's name.
I'm sorry about today.
It's just that... you're so smart and self-sufficient, I don't know what I have to offer you.
You taught Kevin stuff, and he's smart.
Basically.
Kevin likes sports.
I understand sports.
You like physics.
Teach me how to throw a curve ball.
That's physics.
Do you really want me to?
No, dad, I hate sports, but... today...
I could've stayed with you and watched how you solved that case.
I was embarrassed.
What I'm going through at work... the first time you see what I do...
I--I didn't want you to see me as a paper pusher.
Heh!
You've got the world's largest blind spot, you know that?
One minute, you discern an oblique pattern that's invisible to mere mortals.
The next you cant even see a conclusive certainty that's staring you in the face.
I have no idea what you just said.
You always say that I get my brain from mom.
Well, thats not true, I get it from you.
Then why didn't I understand what you said?
No, dad, it's not about knowledge.
It's about how you see the world.
I became a scientist because of you, because you're a detective.
You did?
We're the same.
We both solve puzzles in a universe where there is no certainty, only probability and possibility.
Well, I never... thought of it like that.
Only I live in my head.
You're in the world changing people's lives.
Like today.
How could you think I wouldn't want to see that?
This girl, uh, Glynis.
You really like her?
Yeah.
Dad, um... when you, um, when you get your gun back, can you take me to the shooting range?
You want to shoot?
Ballistics is applied physics, and... you know, I like to blow stuff up.
Heh heh!
Sure.
Me, too.
Yo, snow white!
What's up?
Hey.
I'm just waiting for Casper.
She left.
She said her dad was coming back for her.
Did you see him?
No, but she had her bag packed.
Well, what if she just took off by herself?
I don't know.
Want to jump, Joan?
Did her dad really come back?
You did what you were supposed to do.
What a cop-out!
You get me all wrapped up in her life and now you're not even gonna tell me what happened to her?
The connection you and Casper have, you think that's gone just because she went away?
Is your connection with Adam gone because he's with Iris?
Real connections, they can't be broken by time or space.
I wanted to help her, I wanted to get her a place, get her dad a job.
You can't fix everything, Joan.
She's my friend.
I want to know what's gonna happen to her.
I know you do.
But sometimes it's enough to plant the seed, walk away, and let the flower grow on its own.
Yo, snow white, short stuff, want to Dutch?
Come on.
Previously on Desperate Housewives...
- Zach's gone from Silvercrest.
- Hungry?
Sometimes...
If I don't get help, I will lose my mind.
- Where can I score some nanny?
...no matter how hard you try...
FBI!
Carlos Solis, I have a warrant for your arrest.
...some problems...
- Sorry, you are?
- You've met Maisy Gibbons?
- She's a nightmare.
- Maisy loves to rule her kingdom.
You are unhappy with our sex life.
You're not getting something but are afraid to ask.
...can't be easily solved.
To understand Maisy Gibbons, you first need to know how she spent her afternoons.
Her mornings were spent running errands for her husband.
Hi.
Her evenings were spent helping with homework.
OK, so, nine plus one is...
But her afternoons, well, they were spent in the company of men.
Frustrated, misunderstood, lonely men, willing to pay money to feel a little less lonely.
And Maisy Gibbons was willing to help them.
Maisy, I've always wondered.
Nobody knows about your little hobby, do they?
Is it hard?
- Keeping a secret like this?
- Well, maybe if it was just my secret.
But the way I see it, I keep the secrets of every man who comes to me.
And I find that absolutely exhilarating.
A few years back, Harold lost his job and we had to give up our membership at the country club.
And then one day one of my club friends asked why she hadn't seen me around.
I told her that we couldn't afford it any more.
She waved it off like it was nothing, but I saw her get that look in her eye, that look of... pity.
Maybe she was just trying to be nice.
Anyway, is that so bad, feeling sorry for someone?
When they say something, they are being supportive, but when they say nothing, they think you're so far gone, you're never coming back.
Gotcha.
Anyway, a couple months later, I started my little hobby, and the most wonderful thing happened.
This woman's husband became one of my regulars.
Wow.
Would you be a lamb and go out the back?
- That's my next appointment.
- Sure.
It's the husband of the woman I was telling you about.
- Hello, there.
- Hey, Maisy.
Every morality play has its cast of characters.
There is always an innocent victim, a deceitful villain, a prosecutor who seeks the truth, a magistrate who dispenses justice and a lawyer who charges too much.
This morality play was being produced at the Fairview County Courthouse.
Its themes were trust and betrayal.
So what's your issue with bail in this case, Ms McCready?
We want bail denied, Your Honour.
The company imported goods manufactured by slave labour.
His business partner, Mr Tanaka, has fled the country, and Mr Solis has refused to surrender his passport.
Dog ate your client's passport, Mr Hartley?
It's been temporarily misplaced, but we maintain that Kisho Tanaka set up and executed the entire operation.
Mr Solis is no business partner but merely a hired contractor.
I'd also like to point out my client is the sole provider for his wife and his mother, who is hospitalised in a coma as we speak.
Bring me the passport and Mr Solis can visit his mother.
Until then, your client is denied bail and remanded.
What's next?
Finish those Brussels sprouts.
I can see them hidden under your macaroni.
I hate Brussels sprouts.
Well, Brussels sprouts help you grow.
You don't want to be short your whole life, do you?
You know what we'll do?
We're gonna dip 'em in a little cheese.
Here you go.
- Good.
Yummy.
- Disgusting!
Fine.
Be 3'8" the rest of your life.
See if I care.
Good luck finding girlfriends.
- Didn't you have a lunch?
- I'm gonna cancel it.
The boys are in rare form, and you're still finding your way.
Lynette, it's been two days.
I... don't want to shock them by suddenly disappearing.
- Deep down they're very sensitive.
- That's a paper airplane.
They'll be fine.
Now go.
Get out of here.
You call me if you need anything.
- I will.
- OK.
Boys!
Come here and give Momma a three-bear hug.
Come on.
Whoo!
One, two, three...
Get in!
Get in!
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.
- Bye!
- OK.
Watch your hands!
I'm gonna eat upstairs.
I've got a ton of homework.
What, are you storing up for winter?
I'm just really hungry.
I talked to Dad, and he and Brandi might break up.
Oh, how awful.
- Mom, you're smiling.
- Am I?
Anyway, he can't take me this weekend, so I'll be home after all.
Goodnight.
Great.
Our romantic weekend's off.
- We can move it to my house.
- No.
Why not?
I just want it to be special.
And it can't be special at my house?
OK, I know this sounds weird, but I just need to have my things around me.
- What things?
- Perfumes and oils.
I wanna pick out the outfit you're gonna tear off me.
And plus I need to be in complete control of the lighting.
OK.
We'll wait till next weekend.
You are just the sweetest guy.
- I can't wait till next weekend.
- No, me neither.
Tomorrow?
I've got an early job and that's it.
My publisher's got me under the gun for something.
Friday?
- I'm re-piping a house.
- Damn Karl!
Not even married any more and he's still keeping me from having sex.
I can't hide you in my room for ever, and I think we need to tell my mom.
You can trust her, I promise.
You didn't tell her what I told you?
No!
I would never tell anyone that.
- What are you doing?
- I don't wanna cause problems.
I'm just gonna go.
Zach, stop.
Don't go.
I won't tell her.
I swear I'll be out of here soon.
I'll think of something, OK?
- Hello.
- Why are you up?
I could ask you the same question.
I'm going to bed.
I didn't ask you to wait up for me.
Remember, I'm here as our children's father, not your husband.
What are you doing?
Were you with a woman?
Did you tell her you have a wife or does that hinder your style?
All right, even if I was seeing someone, I have every right to.
Exploring options is the point of being separated.
- Options!
I'm not a mutual fund, Rex.
- That's not...
Bree, you should get out there, try and meet someone.
Meet someone?
I'm raising your children.
I am just trying to move on with my life.
- It is nothing to be ashamed of.
- OK.
Why don't you just call up your mystery woman and invite her over?
I'll pull out the sofa bed and you can take her right there.
Andrew!
Danielle!
Daddy's gonna fornicate for us!
Just keep your voice down.
Why?
Are you feeling ashamed?
The next morning started with a banging.
No one knew where Martha Huber was, and Edie Britt was starting to worry.
Edie didn't like worrying.
She felt it gave her wrinkles.
So, out of concern for her face, and Mrs Huber,
Edie decided to find out what was going on.
Yao Lin, listen.
It's very important that we find Carlos's passport.
I already looked through his office.
I need you to search the bedroom.
What?
With Mr Solis in jail, how you gonna pay me?
I have children.
Yao Lin, your kids are in their twenties.
But if it'll make you shut up...
Here.
Three weeks in advance.
If you don't mind, can I call your bank?
Yao Lin, don't be stupid.
People don't become poor overnight.
That's my car.
Oh, my God.
Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing?
Where are you taking my car?
The government's impounding it.
Call that number if you have any questions.
Oh, my word.
You call this a paint job?
I don't want to see it again till it's perfect!
I wonder what's going on over there.
Claire did OK yesterday.
It could have been beginner's luck.
I should call.
For the first time in years you finally have some free time, and you're wasting it obsessing about the kids.
I don't know this woman.
So she has a degree in sociology.
Who doesn't?
My boys are a lot to handle.
What if she's not up to it?
If you really have that many doubts, you should go buy a hidden camera.
What, a nanny-cam?
Yeah.
People do terrible things when they think no one's watching.
Yeah.
I couldn't tape Claire.
It would be a breach of trust.
Trust is overrated.
So... how are things with you and Rex?
Fine.
Why do you ask?
I'm just curious.
He moves out, moves back in.
Is he back for good?
The situation is... fluid.
I'm not certain what his plans are yet.
So if you're not sure he's back for good, why are you ironing his shirts?
Because I have faith that he'll come back and that he'll do the right thing.
That's good.
It's good to have faith in people.
Yeah.
But I'd still buy that camera.
- Hello?
- Mike?
My oven's out.
Come over and help me find my pilot light.
Oh, candles.
Mike, is that you?
I'm up here!
Mike?
- Oh, my God!
Oh, God.
- What the hell?
I'm so sorry.
I thought someone was in the house.
- So you took your clothes off?
- No, I was going to seduce you.
- Didn't really work.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you OK?
Well...
Please don't be mad.
Hey, there.
Zach?
What are you doing here?
Later that day, while Claire was out getting the boys wired on ice cream,
Lynette did some wiring of her own.
You can't do this.
You can't send Zach back.
What else can I do?
He can't stay here.
His father sent him to a psycho ward.
Actually, they call it a rehabilitation centre.
- What do you think?
- Paul is his father.
He has a right to know his son's OK.
If he finds out you're hiding him, you could get in a lot of trouble.
He's right.
Sorry, guys.
Don't do this.
If you knew what Zach had been through...
Julie.
Julie, it's OK.
I'll be fine.
I'll take him back over so you two can...
Listen, if Paul sees Zach and freaks out...
- I'll bring him right back.
- Thank you.
Young lady, we need to talk about what you did.
I don't feel like talking to you right now.
Listen, Zach...
If things ever get really bad...
It's got my cell number on it.
Give me a call... any time.
Thanks.
Thank God.
- How did you?
- We'll talk later.
Remember, any time.
- I heard you moved back home.
- Yeah, I had to.
We had some problems with Andrew.
I'll move out eventually.
- Spikes or pearls?
- Your choice.
You know what I think?
You don't really want to leave her.
- Don't psychoanalyse me.
- You're still in love.
- I never said I wasn't.
- Why divorce?
So now you're rooting for us two crazy kids to work it out?
You know me.
I'm just a romantic at heart.
Scarves or cuffs?
Up to you.
Even if I could find a way to deal with
Bree's obsessive-compulsive thing, it's not the only problem.
As you know, I have certain needs.
Boots or stilettos?
Stilettos, please.
Why don't you just tell Bree what you need?
Tell her what you want.
- Because she'd say no.
- So?
I've said no to some things you've asked me to do.
Yeah, that's different.
I don't care if you reject me.
Rex, would you trust me on this?
Sometimes when you love somebody, you just gotta make sacrifices for them.
Love or passion.
That's an awful choice to make.
Yes, it is.
I have to warn you, this might hurt a little bit.
How am I supposed to live without a car?
Tanaka's still at large and they want Carlos to flip on him.
This is their way of playing hardball.
I'm guessing that they're not done yet.
- Why?
What else could they take?
- Pretty much anything.
It's all fair game if they can trace it to ill-gotten gains.
No, some of this stuff is mine, when I modelled, before I even met Carlos.
See this?
Kosta Boda.
I bought it when I landed my first cover.
This...
I spent eight hours on a rock in a bikini for that painting.
- I understand how you feel.
- You don't.
I have dug myself up from dirt to afford these things and no one is gonna take them away.
Then find a good hiding place.
They can't take what they can't find.
And if you can scare up that passport, that would be good.
- Hi, Gabrielle.
- Hi.
- What have you got there?
- My china.
You've always loved it.
I thought you might wanna borrow it for a while.
Well, that's very thoughtful of you.
Say, can I store some odds and ends in your garage?
Sure.
Why don't you come by tomorrow?
Sooner's better than later.
- Just like...
- Come on now.
Yes!
Rex?
Rex?
Rex!
I need an ambulance.
Right away.
Hello?
Yes, this is she.
Yes, he's my husband.
I'm here to see Rex Van de Kamp.
Apparently he had a heart attack.
He's being prepped for surgery now.
Could I at least poke my head in?
I'm his wife.
- You're his wife?
- Yes.
Why?
I was thinking of a different patient.
Let me get the doctor.
As Claire prepared for bed, she was unaware that somewhere else in the Scavo house the day she had just finished was starting all over again.
Lynette was relieved to see that Claire was doing a good job.
- After further viewing...
- Three-bear hug.
...it dawned on Lynette Claire might be doing herjob a little too well.
Here's the candles I borrowed.
Thanks.
I'm trying to read, if you don't mind.
I cannot believe, after everything you did, you're mad at me.
I told Zach that he could trust you and you turned him in.
Well, someone had to be responsible.
Like it or not, I've got a birth certificate that says I'm your mother.
- Since when?
- What is that supposed to mean?
Since Dad left, if there's been a mother here, it's been me.
Julie!
After the divorce you stayed in bed for a week and I had to beg you to eat.
Yeah, but...
I had to clean the house, make sure the bills were paid, even schedule my doctor's appointment.
- I was in bad shape back then.
- It's still going on.
And now that I need some support, you decide to play the mom card?
I had to send Zach back.
We could have gotten in a lot of trouble.
Now Zach's the one who's in trouble.
You sent him back to a man who hates him.
As Gabrielle considered the vast emptiness of her new surroundings, she was surprised to find there was only one thing she truly missed her husband.
We have a warrant to enter your house and repossess any goods we suspect may have been obtained... illegally.
We're not into clutter.
All right.
Harvey The Flying Turtle.
Doesn't this look fun?
- Where's Claire?
- I gave her the afternoon off.
- Who wants to turn pages?
- Is she sick?
No.
I just wanted us all to spend the day together, like we used to.
Here we go. "Once upon a time there was a young turtle named Harvey."
"Harvey told the other turtles 'I'm going to fly off and see the world."'
"The other turtles said 'Turtles can't fly!"'
It's getting good now, huh?
- Well, what's wrong?
- Claire does funny voices.
Does she, now?
OK.
"Harvey didn't like the turtles laughing so he told them
'I'll show you!
I will fly higher than the birds."'
- That's not funny.
- Yeah, well, I'm just warming up.
"Bruno, the big bad turtle, took Harvey up on the cliff and threw him over."
"He proclaimed 'We'll see if you can fly!
Fly or die!
Fly or die!"'
When's Claire coming back?
What happened to your nails?
I moved all our stuff to keep it from the Feds.
It kills me that I'm putting you through this.
Hands on the table.
It's not your fault.
You didn't do anything wrong.
I'll take care of everything until you're back to do it yourself.
And you will be soon.
I gotta be honest.
I didn't know how you would hold up.
I knew you were a strong woman, but I had no idea.
You're a good wife, Gaby.
A real partner.
Carlos, I love you so much.
I would give up a houseful of expensive junk just to put this behind us and have you home with me.
That sounds pretty good right now.
- I'm gonna kiss my husband now.
- Hands on the table.
There's a false panel on the back wall of my closet.
My passport is there, along with some papers.
Take the passport to the lawyer and burn the papers.
Carlos, did you know what Tanaka was doing?
Just burn the papers.
Hey, Lynette.
Did Martha Huber leave a spare key to her house with you?
No.
Where is she, by the way?
I haven't seen her in days.
You got me.
She kicked me out so fast that I forgot my laptop, and there's just some stuff on there that I don't want anyone else to see.
Well, good luck with that.
You're not looking half bad.
What have you done with your little posse?
- They're with the new nanny.
- Wow.
Your own personal nanny?
Smell you.
Trust me, it's not all it's cracked up to be.
Our mothers didn't get us nannies or put us in daycare because they knew if they did we'd find out there are other women out there who were better mothers than they were.
I had a nanny for a while growing up.
- Mrs Muntz.
- You had a nanny?
Well, actually, she was more like a court-appointed social worker.
My mom did a little time.
She had a thing for bourbon and... shoplifting.
- Sorry.
- Muntz was a hard-ass.
No mercy.
In fact, she was such a disciplinarian that when my mom made parole,
I was actually happy to see her.
Really?
Yeah.
Lesser of two evils.
Anyway, I gotta find a key.
- See you later.
- Bye.
Thanks for your help with Zach before.
It's my pleasure.
I hope he comes out of this OK.
He's a little squirrelly, but he seems like a good kid.
Yeah.
So, how's Julie taking all this?
Not well.
She accused me of not being a good mother.
No, you're a great mom.
Well, she was sort of right.
After my divorce, I really leaned on her a lot.
Seems natural.
And I still kinda do it.
I just want somebody to talk to about all my adult stuff, and she's right there, and she just acts so mature,
I forget she's thirteen.
Well, the good news is that from now on, if you ever want to talk to somebody about grown-up stuff, you got me.
I can't talk to you about everything.
What if I want to talk about the big crush I have on the plumber that lives across the street?
- Big crush, huh?
- Yeah.
Well, you'd have to tell me more.
Well... he's got a smile that's to die for.
And don't get me started on his tattoo.
Thanks.
Bree.
What a nice surprise.
Would you like to come in?
Well, that depends.
Are you having an affair with my husband?
- Would you like some more potatoes?
- You already asked me that.
Sorry.
I'm so relieved you're safe, I'm not thinking straight.
Does that mean you're not gonna send me back to Silvercrest?
You've gotta understand, your behaviour, the violence, breaking into the Van De Kamps...
I just didn't know what you were going through.
You could have asked me.
Well...
I've been remembering things.
Things from when I was little.
- What kind of things?
- Awful things.
Zach, listen to me.
Sometimes it's not good to look back on the past.
But I can't help it.
These images just keep popping into my head.
You've got to find a way to push them back out again.
OK.
More potatoes?
Yes, please.
Sure is nice to be back to normal.
You should know that Rex still loves you... very much.
- He said that?
- Yes.
Then why is he so unhappy?
He has certain needs, and he's afraid to discuss them with you.
Needs?
Like sexual needs?
Yes.
And have you fulfilled those needs?
I see.
You are pretty brazen for a woman who just admitted, however tacitly, that she just slept with my husband.
If I told anyone, they would never speak to you again.
You're not gonna tell a soul.
Yeah, you may hate me, but you'd hate the humiliation a lot more.
I don't hate you, Maisy.
I pity you.
- Hi.
- Hey, Lynette.
- You heading out now?
- Yep.
I'll be home late, so just the usual routine.
- A nap for Penny and...
- No sugar after five.
I got it.
You're the best.
One more thing.
Since the boys are having corndogs for dinner,
I'd like you to make sure they get a vegetable to go with it.
- Brussels sprouts?
- They're full of iron.
- Make sure they clean their plates.
- Not a problem.
I have this trick.
- I cover the veggies with some cheese.
- You sly dog.
That night Lynette settled in to watch her personal pick for feel-good movie of the year.
You need to eat your Brussels sprouts.
- Brussels sprouts?
Disgusting!
- I don't want this!
Hey!
Yes, you do!
Don't throw them.
- Hey!
Hey, stop it!
- I hate Brussels sprouts!
You guys, stop it!
Do not throw them at me.
Cut it out!
Hey.
Hey.
They operated, huh?
They sure did.
How'd it go?
It went well.
The surgeon says you're gonna be as good as new.
- You look like you've been crying.
- I have.
I was so afraid you were gonna die.
There's so many things I haven't had a chance to tell you.
- I'm sorry you were so worried.
- That's OK.
How are you now, Rex?
Are you strong enough to listen to the things I need to tell you?
Sure, hon.
I know you still love me.
Maisy told me.
She did?
As of this moment, Rex, I am no longer your wife.
I am gonna go out and find the most vindictive lawyer I can find, and together we are going to eviscerate you.
I am gonna take away your money, your family and your dignity.
- Do you hear me?
- Bree...
And I am so thrilled to know that you still love me.
Because I want what's about to happen to you to hurt as much as is humanly possible.
I'm so glad you didn't die before I got a chance to tell you that.
Trust is a fragile thing.
- Bye, guys!
- Bye, Mom!
Once earned, it affords us tremendous freedom.
But once trust is lost, it can be impossible to recover.
Of course, the truth is, we never know who we can trust.
Those we're closest to can betray us.
Police, open up!
And total strangers can come to our rescue.
In the end, most people decide to trust only themselves.
It really is the simplest way to keep from getting burned.
Previously on "desperate housewives"...
Zach's gone from silvercrest.
hungry?
Sometimes...
If I don't get some help, I will lose my mind.
Where can I score some high-grade nanny?
No matter how hard you try...
FBI.
Open the door.
Carlos Solis, I have a warrant for your arrest.
Some problems...
I-I'm sorry.
And you are?
I take it you've met Maisy Gibbons.
She's a total nightmare.
Maisy does love to rule her little kingdom.
You are unhappy with our sex life.
You're not getting something from me, but you're simply too afraid to ask.
Can't be easily solved.
To understand Maisy Gibbons, you first need to know how she spent her afternoons.
Her mornings were spent running errands for her husband.
Hi.
Her evenings were spent washing dishes and helping with homework.
Um, okay, so 9 plus 1 is... but her afternoons -- well, they were spent in the company of men.
Frustrated... misunderstood... lonely men willing to pay money to feel a little less lonely.
And Maisy Gibbons was willing to help them.
Maisy, I've always wondered, nobody knows about your little hobby, do they?
Mnh-mnh.
Is it hard keeping a secret like this?
Well, maybe if it was just my secret, but the way I see it, I keep the secrets of every man who comes to me, and I find that absolutely exhilarating.
A few years back, Harold lost his job, and we had to give up our membership at the country club.
And then one day, one of my club friends asked why she hadn't seen me around lately, and I told her that we couldn't afford it anymore.
She waved it off like it was nothing, but I saw her get that look in her eye, that look of pity.
Maybe she was just trying to be nice.
Anyway, is that so bad, feeling sorry for someone? Well, when they say something, they are being supportive, but when they say nothing, it's because they think that you're so far gone, you're never coming back.
Gotcha.
Anyway, a couple of months later,
I started my little hobby, and the most wonderful thing happened.
This woman's husband became one of my regulars.
Wow.
Oh.
Would you be a lamb and go out the back? It's my next appointment.
Sure.
It's the husband of the woman I was telling you about.
Hello there.
Hey, Maisy.
Episode 10 :
Come Back to Me Every morality play has its cast of characters.
There is always an innocent victim, a deceitful villain, a prosecutor who seeks the truth, a magistrate who dispenses justice, and a lawyer who charges too much.
This morality play was being produced at the fairview county courthouse.
Its themes were trust and betrayal.
So what's your issue with bail in this case, Ms. Mcready?
We want bail denied, your honor.
The defendant's company imported goods manufactured by slave labor, and his business partner Mr. Tanaka has already fled the country, and Mr. Solis himself has refused to surrender his passport.
Dog ate your client's passport, Mr. Hartley?
It's been temporarily misplaced, your honor, but we maintain that Kisho Tanaka set up and executed the entire operation.
nbsp;
Mr. Solis is no business partner, but merely a hired contractor.
And I'd also like to point out that my client is the sole provider for his wife and his mother, who is hospitalized in a coma as we speak.
Bring me the passport, and Mr. Solis can visit his mother.
Until then, your client is denied bail and remanded.
What's next? You better finish those brussels sprouts.
And don't think I can't see them hidden under your macaroni.
I hate brussels sprouts.
Yeah, well, brussels sprouts help you grow.
You don't want to be short your whole life, do you?
Here, look, you know what we'll do?
We're going to dip them in a little cheese.
Here you go.
Good.
Yummy.
Yummy.
- Ew!
- Yuck!
Fine, fine, be 3'8" the rest of your life.
See if I care.
Good luck finding girlfriends.
Hey, didn't you have a lunch today?
I'm going to cancel it.
The boys are in rare form, and you're still finding your way.
Lynette, it's been two days.
I don't want to shock them by suddenly disappearing.
You know, deep down, they're very sensitive.
They'll be fine.
Now go.
Get out of here.
You have my cell phone number.
You call me if you need anything.
I will.
Okay.
You boys, come here and give mama a 3-bear hug.
Come on.
Whoo!
1, 2, 3.
Whoa!
Get in, get in.
- Mm, okay.
- Bye.
- Bye, mom!
- Bye.
Bye!
Okay.
Watch your hands.
Um, I'm going to eat upstairs.
I've got a ton of homework.
What are you, storing up for winter? I'm just really hungry.
Mm.
Oh, I talked to dad today, and apparently, he and Brandi might break up.
Oh.
How awful.
Mom, you're smiling.
Am I? Anyway, because of all the drama, he can't take me this weekend, so I'll be home after all.
Good night.
Oh, great.
Our romantic weekend's off.
We could move it to my house.
No.
Why not? I just -
- I just want it to be special.
And it can't be special at my house.
Okay, I know this sounds weird, but I just need to have my things around me.
What things?
Perfumes and oils, and I want to pick out the outfit that you're going to tear off me.
And plus, I need to be in complete control of the lighting.
Okay.
We'll wait till next weekend.
You are just the sweetest guy.
All right.
I can't wait till next weekend.
No, me neither.
What about tomorrow while Julie's at school?
I've got an early job, and that's it.
Oh, no good.
My publisher's got me under the gun for something.
What about friday? I'm repiping a house.
Mm, damn karl.
I'm not even married to him anymore, and he's still keeping me from having sex.
I can't hide you in my room forever, and...
I think we need to tell my mom.
You can trust her, I promise.
You didn't tell her what I told you, did you?
No.
No, no, no.
I would never tell anyone that.
What are you doing?
I don't want to cause problems for you.
I'm just -
- I'm just going to go.
Zach, stop.
Don't go.
I won't tell her.
I swear, I'll be out of here soon.
I'll think of something, okay? H ello.
Why are you up? I could ask you the same question.
I'm going to bed.
I didn't ask you to wait up for me.
Remember, I'm here as our children's father, not your husband.
What are you doing? Were you with a woman? Did you tell her that you have a wife, or does that hinder your pickup style?
All right.
Even if I was seeing someone, I have every right to.
Exploring options is the whole point of being separated.
"Options"?
I'm not a mutual fund, Rex.
Oh, that's not -- Bree, you should get out there.
Try and meet someone.
Meet someone.
I'm raising your children.
I am just trying to move on with my life.
It is nothing to be ashamed of.
Oh, okay.
I tell you what, then -- why don't you just call up your mystery woman and invite her over?
I'll pull out the sofa bed, and you can take her right there.
Andrew, Danielle, daddy's going to fornicate for us!
Just keep your voice down.
Why?
Are you feeling ashamed? The next morning started with a banging.
No one knew where Martha Huber was, and Edie Britt was starting to worry.
Edie didn't like worrying.
She felt it gave her wrinkles.
So out of concern for her face and Mrs. Huber, Edie decided to find out what was going on.
Yao lin, listen to me.
It's very important that we find Carlos's passport.
I already looked through his office, so I need you to search the bedroom.
What? With Mr. Solis in jail, how are you going to pay me?
I have children.
Yao lin, your kids are in their 20s.
If it'll make you shut up... here.
Three weeks in advance.
If you don't mind, can I call your bank?
Yao lin, don't be stupid.
People don't become poor overnight.
That's my car.
Oh, my god.
Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?
Where are you taking my car? Government's impounding it.
Here's your receipt.
Call that number if you have any questions.
You call this a paint job? I don't want to see it again until it's perfect! Wonder what's going on over there.
I mean, Claire did okay with the kids yesterday, but that could have been beginner's luck.
You think I should call?
I should call.
Lynette, for the first time in years, you finally have some free time, and you're wasting it obsessing about the kids.
It's just I don't know this woman.
I mean, not really.
So she has a degree in sociology.
Well, big deal.
Who doesn't?
My boys are a lot to handle.
What if she's not up to it? You know, if you really have that many doubts, you should go buy a hidden camera.
What, a nanny-cam?
Yeah.
People do terrible things when they think no one's watching them.
Yeah.
nbsp;
I don't really think I could videotape Claire.
It would be a breach of trust.
Trust is overrated.
So...how are things with you and Rex? Fine.
Why do you ask? Well, I'm just curious.
I mean, he moves out, moves back in.
Is he back for good? Uh, the situation is, um, fluid.
I'm not certain what his plans are yet.
Huh.
So if you're not sure he's back for good, why are you ironing his shirts? Because I have faith that he'll come back and that he'll do the right thing.
That's good.
It's good to have faith in people.
Yeah.
But I'd still buy that camera.
Hello?
- Mike?
- Yeah?
My oven's out.
Mm-hmm.
Come over and help me find my pilot light.
Al green's "here I am (come and take me)"
Laying all my troubles down here I am, baby come and take me here I am, baby ooh, come and take me take me by the hand ooh, yeah, show me here I am, baby aah! Oh, candles, candles.
Here I am, baby come and take me, here I am, baby come and take me
Take me by the hand here I am, baby Mike, is that you? I'm up here.
I can always call you for a helpin' hand I know you'll do the best you can
[Come on in...] but it don't take much from me Mike? Oh, there's love inside me
I believe there's going to be an explosion yeah, yeah, whoo-hoo it's tough for me, oh, yeah Aah!
Oh, my god.
What the hell?
I'm so sorry.
I thought there was someone in the house.
So you took your clothes off?
No, my clothes were already off.
I was going to seduce you.
It didn't really work.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you okay? Well... please don't be mad. hey there.
Zach.
What are you doing here? Later that day, while Claire was out getting the boys wired on ice cream, Lynette did some wiring of her own.
No, you can't do this.
You can't send Zach back.
Julie, what else can I do?
He can't stay here.
His father sent him to a psycho ward.
Actually, they call it a rehabilitation center.
What do you think?
Paul is his father.
He has a right to know his son's okay.
And if he finds out you're hiding him, you could get in a lot of trouble.
He's right.
Sorry, guys.
Mom, please don't do this.
If you knew what Zach had been through --
Julie, Julie, it's okay.
I'll be fine.
I'll, uh, take him back over so you two can... listen, if Paul sees Zach and freaks out --
I'll bring him right back.
Thank you.
Young lady, we need to talk about what you did.
I really don't feel like talking to you right now.
Uh, listen, Zach... if things ever get really bad... it's got my cell number on it.
You give me a call... anytime.
Thanks.
Oh, thank god.
How did you -- we'll talk later.
Remember, anytime.
I heard you moved back home.
Yeah, I-I had to.
We -- we had some problems with Andrew.
I'll move out eventually.
Spikes or pearls?
Your choice.
You know what I think?
Hmm?
You don't really want to leave her.
Please don't psycho analyze me.
Well, you're still in love with her.
I never said I wasn't.
Then why divorce?
Now you're rooting for us two crazy kids to work it out?
Hey You know me.
I'm just a romantic at heart.
Scarves or cuffs? Up to you.
Even if I could find a way to deal with Bree's whole obsessive-compulsive thing, it's not the only problem in our marriage.
As you know, I have certain needs.
Boots or stilettos? Stilettos... please.
Why don't you just tell Bree what you need? Tell her what you want.
Because she'd say no.
So?
I've said no to some things you've asked me to do.
Yeah, that's different.
I don't care if you reject me.
Rex... do you trust me on this?
Sometimes when you love somebody, you've just got to make sacrifices for them.
Love or passion -- it's an awful choice to make.
Yes, it is.
Now, I have to warn you -- this might hurt a little bit.
Aah! How am I supposed to live without a car? Okay, Gabrielle, listen.
Tanaka's still at large, and they're going to want Carlos to flip on him, so this is their way of playing hardball.
Now, I'm guessing that they're not done yet.
Why?
What else could they take from us?
Pretty much anything.
It's all fair game if they even think they can trace it to ill-gotten gains.
No, no, no.
No, some of this stuff is mine when I modeled, before I even met Carlos.
See this?
Kosta boda.
Bought it when I landed my first cover.
This -
- I spent eight hours on a rock in a bikini for that painting.
I understand how you feel -- no, you don't understand.
I have dug myself up from dirt to afford these things, and no one is going to take them away from me.
Then I suggest you find yourself a good hiding place.
They can't take what they can't find.
Oh, and if you can scare up that passport, too, that would be good.
- Oh, hi, Gabrielle.
- Hi.
What have you got there?
My china.
I know how you've always loved it, and I thought you might want to borrow it for a while.
Oh.
Well, that's, um, very thoughtful of you.
Say, um, can I store some odds and ends in your garage?
Sure.
Why don't you, uh, come by tomorrow?
Sooner is better than later, right? Oh.
Oh.
Mm.
Aah.
Just like...
Come on now.
Yes!
Ah.
Rex? Rex? Rex?
! I need an ambulance.
Right away.
Oh.
Hello?
Yes, this is she.
Yes, he's my husband.
Um, excuse me.
I'm here to see Rex Van De Kamp.
Apparently, he had a heart attack.
I'm not sure -- he's being prepped for surgery right now.
If you'd like to wait... could I at least poke my head in?
I'm his wife.
You're his wife?
Yes.
Why?
I was thinking of a different patient.
Let me get the doctor. [Rex Van De Kamp]
[Maisy Gibbons] As Claire prepared for bed, she was unaware that somewhere else in the Scavo house, the day she had just finished was starting all over again.
The dog is blue, the doggie is blue
Lynette was relieved to see that Claire was doing a good job.
But after further viewing... come give me a 3-bear hug.
It dawned on Lynette... Claire might be doing her job a little too well.
Here's the candles I borrowed.
Thanks.
I'm trying to read, so if you don't mind...
I cannot believe, after everything you did, you're mad at me.
I told Zach that he could trust you, and you turned him in.
Yeah, well, someone had to be responsible, and like it or not,
I've got a birth certificate that says I'm your mother.
Since when?
What is that supposed to mean?
Since dad left, if there's been a mother around here, it's been me.
Julie.
Do you remember after the divorce that you stayed in bed for a week and I had to beg you to eat something? Yeah, but -- and for weeks, I had to clean the house, I had to make sure that the bills were paid.
I even had to schedule my own doctor's appointment once.
I was in bad shape back then.
It's still going on.
And now that I need some support, you decide to play the mom card?
I had to send Zach back.
We could have gotten in a lot of trouble.
Yeah, well, now Zach's the one who's in trouble.
You sent him back to a man who hates him.
As gabrielle considered the vast emptiness of her new surroundings, she was surprised to find there was only one thing she truly missed -- her husband.
Mrs. Solis, we have a warrant to enter your house and repossess any goods which we suspect may have been obtained...illegally.
We're not into clutter.
All right,"harvey the flying turtle." Doesn't this look fun.
Where's Claire?
I gave her the afternoon off.
Who wants to turn pages?
Is she sick?
No, she's fine.
I just wanted us all to spend the day together, you know?
Like we used to.
Here we go.
"Once upon a time, there was a young turtle named harvey.
"Every day, harvey would tell all the other turtles,
"'one day, I'm going to fly off this island "and go see the world.
'The other turtles laughed and said,'turtles can't fly.'"
Ooh, it's getting good now, huh? W-what's wrong?
When Claire reads, she does funny voices.
Does she, now?
Okay. "Harvey didn't like the turtles laughing, "so he told them,
'I'll show you.
One day I will fly higher than the birds.'"
That's not funny.
Yeah?
Well, I'm just warming up.
"Then bruno, the big, bad turtle, "took harvey up on the cliff and threw him over, "and he proclaimed,
"'we'll see if you can fly.
Fly or die, fly or die.'"
When's Claire coming back? What happened to your nails? Oh, I -
- I moved all our stuff to keep it from the feds.
It kills me that I'm putting you through this.
Hands on the table.
It's not your fault.
You didn't do anything wrong.
I'll take care of everything until you're back to do it yourself.
And you will be soon.
I got to be honest, I didn't know how you would hold up.
I knew you were a strong woman, but I had no idea.
You're a good wife, gabby, a real partner.
Oh, Carlos, I love you so much.
I would give up that house full of expensive junk just to put this behind us and have you home with me.
That sounds pretty good right now.
I'm going to kiss my husband now.
Hands on the table.
There's a false panel on the back wall of my closet.
My passport is there, along with some papers.
Take the passport to the lawyer and burn the papers.
Carlos, did you know what Tanaka was doing? Just burn... the papers.
Hey, Lynette.
Did Martha Huber happen to leave a spare key to her house with you?
No.
Oh.
Where is she, by the way?
I haven't seen her in days.
Got me.
She kicked me out so fast that I forgot my laptop, and there's just some stuff on there that I don't want anyone else to see.
Oh.
Well... good luck with that.
You know, you're not looking half bad.
What have you done with that little posse of yours?
They're with the new nanny.
Wow, your own personal nanny?
Smell you.
Well, trust me, it's not all it's cracked up to be.
You know, our mothers were smart.
They didn't get us nannies or put us in day care because they knew if they did, we'd find out there are other women out there who are better mothers than they were.
You know, I had a nanny for a while growing up -
- Mrs. Muntz.
You had a nanny?
Well, actually, she was more like a court-appointed social worker.
My mom did a little time.
She had a thing for bourbon and shoplifting.
Oh.
Sorry.
Oh, Muntz was a hard-ass --no mercy.
In fact, she was such a disciplinarian that when my mom made parole,
I was actually happy to see her.
Really? Yeah.
Lesser of two evils.
Huh.
Anyway, I got to find a key.
- See you later.
- Bye.
Thanks for your help with Zach before.
Oh, it's my pleasure.
I hope he comes out of this okay.
He's a little squirrelly, but seems like a good kid.
Yeah.
So how's Julie taking all this? Not well.
She accused me of not being a good mother.
Oh, you're a great mom.
Well, she was sort of right.
After my divorce, I really leaned on her a lot.
Seems natural.
And I still kind of do it.
I just want somebody to talk to about all my adult stuff, and she's right there, and she just acts so mature.
I forget she's 13.
Well, the good news is that from now on, if you ever want to talk to somebody about grown-up stuff, you got me.
Well, I can't talk to you about everything.
Oh.
What if I want to talk about the big crush I have on the plumber that lives across the street? Big crush, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Wow, you'd have to tell me more.
Well, um... he's got a smile that's to die for, and don't get me started on his tattoo.
Thanks.
Oh, Bree.
What a-a nice surprise.
Would you like to come in? Well, that depends.
Are you having an affair with my husband? Would you like some more potatoes?
You already asked me that.
Sorry.
I'm so relieved you're safe, I'm, uh...
I'm not thinking straight.
Does that mean you're not going to send me back to silvercrest?
You've got to understand, your behavior, the violence, breaking into the Van De Kamps' -- I just didn't know what you were going through.
You could have asked me.
Well... I've been remembering things... things from when I was little.
What kind of things?
Awful things.
Zach, listen to me.
Sometimes it's not good to look back on the past.
But I can't help it.
These images just keep popping into my head.
Well, then, you've got to find a way to push them back out again.
Okay.
More potatoes? Yes, please.
Sure is nice to be back to normal.
You should know that Rex still loves you... very much.
He said that?
Yes.
Then why is he so unhappy? He has certain needs, and he's afraid to discuss them with you.
Needs -- like... sexual needs?
Yes.
And have you fulfilled those needs? I see.
You know, you are pretty brazen for a woman who just admitted, however tacitly, that she just slept with my husband.
If I told anyone in this neighborhood, they would never speak to you again.
You're not going to tell a soul.
Yeah, you may hate me, but you'd hate the humiliation a lot more.
Oh, I don't hate you, Maisy.
I pity you.
Hi.
Oh, hey, Lynette.
Are you heading out now?
Yep.
Um, I'll be home late, so just the usual routine -- a nap for penny, and --
I know, no sugar after 5:00.
I got it.
You're the best.
Oh, one more thing.
Since the boys are having corn dogs for dinner,
I'd like you to make sure they get a vegetable to go with it.
Brussels sprouts?
They're full of iron.
Would you make sure they clean their plates?
Not a problem.
I have this little trick I do.
I cover the veggies with some cheese.
Ooh, you sly dog.
That night, Lynette settled in to watch her personal pick for feel-good movie of the year.
You guys, you need to eat your brussels sprouts.
Brussels sprouts!
I don't want this!
Hey!
Yes, you do! You guys, don't throw them -- hey!
Hey, stop it!
Do not -- ow!
Hey!
You guys, stop it!
Do not throw these at me, you guys!
Cut it out!
Hey.
Hey.
I guess they operated, huh? They sure did.
How' d it go? It went well.
The surgeon says you're going to be as good as new.
You look like you've been crying.
I have.
I was so afraid you were going to die.
There's so many things I haven't had a chance to tell you.
I'm sorry you were so worried.
It's okay.
How are you now, Rex?
Are you strong enough to listen to the things I need to tell you? Sure, hon.
I know you still love me.
Maisy told me.
She did? As of this moment, Rex,
I am no longer your wife.
I am going to go out and find the most vindictive lawyer can find, and together, we are going to eviscerate you.
I am going to take away your money, your family, and your dignity.
Do you hear me?
Bree -- and I am so thrilled to know that you still love me, because I want what's about to happen to you... to hurt as much as is humanly possible.
I'm so glad you didn't die before I got a chance to tell you that.
Trust is a fragile thing.
Bye, guys.
- Bye, mom.
Bye, mom.
- Bye, mommy.
Once earned, it affords us tremendous freedom.
But once trust is lost, it can be impossible to recover. [SOLOMON, MILLER HAAS FAMILY LAW] Of course, the truth is we never know who we can trust.
Those we're closest to can betray us.
Police.
Open up.
And total strangers can come to our rescue.
In the end, most people decide to trust only themselves.
It really is the simplest way to keep from getting burned.
Previously on "desperate housewives"...
Zach's gone from silvercrest.
hungry?
Sometimes...
If I don't get some help, I will lose my mind.
Where can I score some high-grade nanny?
No matter how hard you try...
FBI.
Open the door.
Carlos Solis, I have a warrant for your arrest.
Some problems...
I-I'm sorry.
And you are?
I take it you've met Maisy Gibbons.
She's a total nightmare.
Maisy does love to rule her little kingdom.
You are unhappy with our sex life.
You're not getting something from me, but you're simply too afraid to ask.
Can't be easily solved.
To understand Maisy Gibbons, you first need to know how she spent her afternoons.
Her mornings were spent running errands for her husband.
Hi.
Her evenings were spent washing dishes and helping with homework.
Um, okay, so 9 plus 1 is... but her afternoons -- well, they were spent in the company of men.
Frustrated... misunderstood... lonely men willing to pay money to feel a little less lonely.
And Maisy Gibbons was willing to help them.
Maisy, I've always wondered, nobody knows about your little hobby, do they?
Mnh-mnh.
Is it hard keeping a secret like this?
Well, maybe if it was just my secret, but the way I see it, I keep the secrets of every man who comes to me, and I find that absolutely exhilarating.
A few years back, Harold lost his job, and we had to give up our membership at the country club.
And then one day, one of my club friends asked why she hadn't seen me around lately, and I told her that we couldn't afford it anymore.
She waved it off like it was nothing, but I saw her get that look in her eye, that look of pity.
Maybe she was just trying to be nice.
Anyway, is that so bad, feeling sorry for someone?
Well, when they say something, they are being supportive, but when they say nothing,
it's because they think that you're so far gone, you're never coming back.
Gotcha.
Anyway, a couple of months later,
I started my little hobby, and the most wonderful thing happened.
This woman's husband became one of my regulars.
Wow.
Oh.
Would you be a lamb and go out the back?
It's my next appointment.
Sure.
It's the husband of the woman I was telling you about.
Hello there.
Hey, Maisy.
Episode 10 :
Come Back to Me
Every morality play has its cast of characters.
There is always an innocent victim, a deceitful villain, a prosecutor who seeks the truth, a magistrate who dispenses justice, and a lawyer who charges too much.
This morality play was being produced at the fairview county courthouse.
Its themes were trust and betrayal.
So what's your issue with bail in this case, Ms. Mcready?
We want bail denied, your honor.
The defendant's company imported goods manufactured by slave labor, and his business partner Mr. Tanaka has already fled the country, and Mr. Solis himself has refused to surrender his passport.
Dog ate your client's passport, Mr. Hartley?
It's been temporarily misplaced, your honor, but we maintain that Kisho Tanaka set up and executed the entire operation.
Mr. Solis is no business partner, but merely a hired contractor.
And I'd also like to point out that my client is the sole provider for his wife and his mother, who is hospitalized in a coma as we speak.
Bring me the passport, and Mr. Solis can visit his mother.
Until then, your client is denied bail and remanded.
What's next?
You better finish those brussels sprouts.
And don't think I can't see them hidden under your macaroni.
I hate brussels sprouts.
Yeah, well, brussels sprouts help you grow.
You don't want to be short your whole life, do you?
Here, look, you know what we'll do?
We're going to dip them in a little cheese.
Here you go.
Good.
Yummy.
Yummy.
- Ew!
- Yuck!
Fine, fine, be 3'8" the rest of your life.
See if I care.
Good luck finding girlfriends.
Hey, didn't you have a lunch today?
I'm going to cancel it.
The boys are in rare form, and you're still finding your way.
Lynette, it's been two days.
I don't want to shock them by suddenly disappearing.
You know, deep down, they're very sensitive.
They'll be fine.
Now go.
Get out of here.
You have my cell phone number.
You call me if you need anything.
I will.
O kay.
You boys, come here and give mama a 3-bear hug.
Come on.
Whoo!
1, 2, 3.
Whoa!
Get in, get in.
- Mm, okay.
- Bye.
- Bye, mom!
- Bye.
Bye!
Okay.
Watch your hands.
Um, I'm going to eat upstairs.
I've got a ton of homework.
What are you, storing up for winter?
I'm just really hungry.
Mm.
Oh, I talked to dad today, and apparently, he and Brandi might break up.
Oh.
How awful.
Mom, you're smiling.
Am I?
Anyway, because of all the drama, he can't take me this weekend, so I'll be home after all.
Good night.
Oh, great.
Our romantic weekend's off.
We could move it to my house.
No.
Why not?
I just -
- I just want it to be special.
And it can't be special at my house.
Okay, I know this sounds weird, but I just need to have my things around me.
What things?
Perfumes and oils, and I want to pick out the outfit that you're going to tear off me.
And plus, I need to be in complete control of the lighting.
Okay.
We'll wait till next weekend.
You are just the sweetest guy.
All right.
I can't wait till next weekend.
No, me neither.
What about tomorrow while Julie's at school?
I've got an early job, and that's it.
Oh, no good.
My publisher's got me under the gun for something.
What about friday?
I'm repiping a house.
Mm, damn karl.
I'm not even married to him anymore, and he's still keeping me from having sex.
I can't hide you in my room forever, and...
I think we need to tell my mom.
nbsp;
You can trust her, I promise.
You didn't tell her what I told you, did you?
No.
No, no, no.
I would never tell anyone that.
What are you doing?
I don't want to cause problems for you.
I'm just -
- I'm just going to go.
Zach, stop.
Don't go.
I won't tell her.
I swear, I'll be out of here soon.
I'll think of something, okay?
Hello.
Why are you up?
I could ask you the same question.
I'm going to bed.
I didn't ask you to wait up for me.
Remember, I'm here as our children's father, not your husband.
What are you doing?
Were you with a woman?
Did you tell her that you have a wife, or does that hinder your pickup style?
All right.
Even if I was seeing someone, I have every right to.
Exploring options is the whole point of being separated.
"Options"?
I'm not a mutual fund, Rex.
Oh, that's not --
Bree, you should get out there.
Try and meet someone.
Meet someone.
I'm raising your children.
I am just trying to move on with my life.
It is nothing to be ashamed of.
Oh, okay.
I tell you what, then -- why don't you just call up your mystery woman and invite her over?
I'll pull out the sofa bed, and you can take her right there.
Andrew, Danielle, daddy's going to fornicate for us!
Just keep your voice down.
Why?
Are you feeling ashamed?
The next morning started with a banging.
No one knew where Martha Huber was, and Edie Britt was starting to worry.
Edie didn't like worrying.
She felt it gave her wrinkles.
So out of concern for her face and Mrs. Huber, Edie decided to find out what was going on.
Yao lin, listen to me.
It's very important that we find Carlos's passport.
I already looked through his office, so I need you to search the bedroom.
What?
With Mr. Solis in jail, how are you going to pay me?
I have children.
Yao lin, your kids are in their 20s.
If it'll make you shut up... h ere.
Three weeks in advance.
If you don't mind, can I call your bank?
Yao lin, don't be stupid.
People don't become poor overnight.
That's my car.
Oh, my god.
Hey!
H ey!
What are you doing?
Where are you taking my car?
Government's impounding it.
Here's your receipt.
Call that number if you have any questions.
You call this a paint job?
I don't want to see it again until it's perfect!
Wonder what's going on over there.
I mean, Claire did okay with the kids yesterday, but that could have been beginner's luck.
You think I should call?
I should call.
Lynette, for the first time in years, you finally have some free time, and you're wasting it obsessing about the kids.
It's just I don't know this woman.
I mean, not really.
So she has a degree in sociology.
Well, big deal.
Who doesn't?
My boys are a lot to handle.
What if she's not up to it?
You know, if you really have that many doubts, you should go buy a hidden camera.
What, a nanny-cam?
Yeah.
People do terrible things when they think no one's watching them.
Yeah.
nbsp;
I don't really think I could videotape Claire.
It would be a breach of trust.
Trust is overrated.
So...how are things with you and Rex?
Fine.
Why do you ask?
Well, I'm just curious.
I mean, he moves out, moves back in.
Is he back for good?
Uh, the situation is, um, fluid.
I'm not certain what his plans are yet.
Huh.
So if you're not sure he's back for good, why are you ironing his shirts?
Because I have faith that he'll come back and that he'll do the right thing.
That's good.
It's good to have faith in people.
Yeah.
But I'd still buy that camera.
Hello?
- Mike?
- Yeah?
My oven's out.
Mm-hmm.
Come over and help me find my pilot light.
Al green's "here I am (come and take me)"
Laying all my troubles down here I am, baby come and take me here I am, baby ooh, come and take me take me by the hand ooh, yeah, show me here I am, baby
aah!
Oh, candles, candles.
Here I am, baby come and take me, here I am, baby come and take me
Take me by the hand here I am, baby
Mike, is that you?
I'm up here.
I can always call you for a helpin' hand
I know you'll do the best you can
[Come on in...] but it don't take much from me
Mike?
Oh, there's love inside me
I believe there's going to be an explosion yeah, yeah, whoo-hoo it's tough for me, oh, yeah
Aah!
Oh, my god.
What the hell?
I'm so sorry.
I thought there was someone in the house.
So you took your clothes off?
No, my clothes were already off.
I was going to seduce you.
It didn't really work.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Well... please don't be mad.
hey there.
Zach.
What are you doing here?
Later that day, while Claire was out getting the boys wired on ice cream,
Lynette did some wiring of her own.
No, you can't do this.
You can't send Zach back.
Julie, what else can I do?
He can't stay here.
His father sent him to a psycho ward.
Actually, they call it a rehabilitation center.
What do you think?
Paul is his father.
He has a right to know his son's okay.
And if he finds out you're hiding him, you could get in a lot of trouble.
He's right.
Sorry, guys.
Mom, please don't do this.
If you knew what Zach had been through --
Julie, Julie, it's okay.
I'll be fine.
I'll, uh, take him back over so you two can... listen, if Paul sees Zach and freaks out --
I'll bring him right back.
Thank you.
Young lady, we need to talk about what you did.
I really don't feel like talking to you right now.
Uh, listen, Zach... if things ever get really bad... it's got my cell number on it.
You give me a call... anytime.
Thanks.
Oh, thank god.
How did you -- we'll talk later.
Remember, anytime.
I heard you moved back home.
Yeah, I-I had to.
We -- we had some problems with Andrew.
I'll move out eventually.
Spikes or pearls?
Your choice.
You know what I think?
Hmm?
You don't really want to leave her.
Please don't psycho analyze me.
Well, you're still in love with her.
I never said I wasn't.
Then why divorce?
Now you're rooting for us two crazy kids to work it out?
Hey
You know me.
I'm just a romantic at heart.
Scarves or cuffs?
Up to you.
Even if I could find a way to deal with Bree's whole obsessive-compulsive thing, it's not the only problem in our marriage.
As you know, I have certain needs.
Boots or stilettos?
Stilettos... please.
Why don't you just tell Bree what you need?
Tell her what you want.
Because she'd say no.
So?
I've said no to some things you've asked me to do.
Yeah, that's different.
I don't care if you reject me.
Rex... do you trust me on this?
Sometimes when you love somebody, you've just got to make sacrifices for them.
Love or passion -- it's an awful choice to make.
Yes, it is.
Now, I have to warn you -- this might hurt a little bit.
Aah!
How am I supposed to live without a car?
Okay, Gabrielle, listen.
Tanaka's still at large, and they're going to want Carlos to flip on him, so this is their way of playing hardball.
Now, I'm guessing that they're not done yet.
Why?
What else could they take from us?
Pretty much anything.
It's all fair game if they even think they can trace it to ill-gotten gains.
No, no, no.
No, some of this stuff is mine when I modeled, before I even met Carlos.
See this?
Kosta boda.
Bought it when I landed my first cover.
This -
- I spent eight hours on a rock in a bikini for that painting.
I understand how you feel -- no, you don't understand.
I have dug myself up from dirt to afford these things, and no one is going to take them away from me.
Then I suggest you find yourself a good hiding place.
They can't take what they can't find.
Oh, and if you can scare up that passport, too, that would be good.
- Oh, hi, Gabrielle.
- Hi.
What have you got there?
My china.
I know how you've always loved it, and I thought you might want to borrow it for a while.
Oh.
Well, that's, um, very thoughtful of you.
Say, um, can I store some odds and ends in your garage?
Sure.
Why don't you, uh, come by tomorrow?
Sooner is better than later, right?
Oh.
Oh.
Mm.
Aah.
Just like...
Come on now.
Yes!
Ah.
Rex?
Rex?
I need an ambulance.
Right away.
Oh.
Hello?
Yes, this is she.
Yes, he's my husband.
Um, excuse me.
I'm here to see Rex Van De Kamp.
Apparently, he had a heart attack.
I'm not sure -- he's being prepped for surgery right now.
If you'd like to wait... could I at least poke my head in?
I'm his wife.
You're his wife?
Yes.
Why?
I was thinking of a different patient.
Let me get the doctor.
[Rex Van De Kamp]
[Maisy Gibbons]
As Claire prepared for bed, she was unaware that somewhere else in the Scavo house, the day she had just finished was starting all over again.
The dog is blue, the doggie is blue
Lynette was relieved to see that Claire was doing a good job.
But after further viewing... come give me a 3-bear hug.
It dawned on Lynette...
Claire might be doing her job a little too well.
Here's the candles I borrowed.
Thanks.
I'm trying to read, so if you don't mind...
I cannot believe, after everything you did, you're mad at me.
I told Zach that he could trust you, and you turned him in.
Yeah, well, someone had to be responsible, and like it or not,
I've got a birth certificate that says I'm your mother.
Since when?
What is that supposed to mean?
Since dad left, if there's been a mother around here, it's been me.
Julie.
Do you remember after the divorce that you stayed in bed for a week and I had to beg you to eat something?
Yeah, but -- and for weeks, I had to clean the house, I had to make sure that the bills were paid.
I even had to schedule my own doctor's appointment once.
I was in bad shape back then.
It's still going on.
And now that I need some support, you decide to play the mom card?
I had to send Zach back.
We could have gotten in a lot of trouble.
Yeah, well, now Zach's the one who's in trouble.
You sent him back to a man who hates him.
As gabrielle considered the vast emptiness of her new surroundings, she was surprised to find there was only one thing she truly missed -- her husband.
Mrs. Solis, we have a warrant to enter your house and repossess any goods which we suspect may have been obtained...illegally.
We're not into clutter.
All right,"harvey the flying turtle." Doesn't this look fun.
Where's Claire?
I gave her the afternoon off.
Who wants to turn pages?
Is she sick?
No, she's fine.
I just wanted us all to spend the day together, you know?
Like we used to.
Here we go.
"Once upon a time, there was a young turtle named harvey.
"Every day, harvey would tell all the other turtles,
"'one day, I'm going to fly off this island "and go see the world.
'The other turtles laughed and said,'turtles can't fly.'"
Ooh, it's getting good now, huh?
W-what's wrong?
When Claire reads, she does funny voices.
Does she, now?
Okay.
"Harvey didn't like the turtles laughing, "so he told them,
'I'll show you.
One day I will fly higher than the birds.'"
That's not funny.
Yeah?
Well, I'm just warming up.
"Then bruno, the big, bad turtle, "took harvey up on the cliff and threw him over, "and he proclaimed,
"'we'll see if you can fly.
Fly or die, fly or die.'"
When's Claire coming back?
What happened to your nails?
Oh, I -
- I moved all our stuff to keep it from the feds.
It kills me that I'm putting you through this.
Hands on the table.
It's not your fault.
You didn't do anything wrong.
I'll take care of everything until you're back to do it yourself.
And you will be soon.
I got to be honest, I didn't know how you would hold up.
I knew you were a strong woman, but I had no idea.
You're a good wife, gabby, a real partner.
Oh, Carlos, I love you so much.
I would give up that house full of expensive junk just to put this behind us and have you home with me.
That sounds pretty good right now.
I'm going to kiss my husband now.
Hands on the table.
There's a false panel on the back wall of my closet.
My passport is there, along with some papers.
Take the passport to the lawyer and burn the papers.
Carlos, did you know what Tanaka was doing?
Just burn... the papers.
Hey, Lynette.
Did Martha Huber happen to leave a spare key to her house with you?
No.
Oh.
Where is she, by the way?
I haven't seen her in days.
Got me.
She kicked me out so fast that I forgot my laptop, and there's just some stuff on there that I don't want anyone else to see.
Oh.
Well... good luck with that.
You know, you're not looking half bad.
What have you done with that little posse of yours?
They're with the new nanny.
Wow, your own personal nanny?
Smell you.
Well, trust me, it's not all it's cracked up to be.
You know, our mothers were smart.
They didn't get us nannies or put us in day care because they knew if they did, we'd find out there are other women out there who are better mothers than they were.
You know, I had a nanny for a while growing up -
- Mrs. Muntz.
You had a nanny?
Well, actually, she was more like a court-appointed social worker.
My mom did a little time.
She had a thing for bourbon and shoplifting.
Oh.
Sorry.
Oh, Muntz was a hard-ass --no mercy.
In fact, she was such a disciplinarian that when my mom made parole,
I was actually happy to see her.
Really?
Yeah.
Lesser of two evils.
Huh.
Anyway, I got to find a key.
- See you later.
- Bye.
Thanks for your help with Zach before.
Oh, it's my pleasure.
I hope he comes out of this okay.
He's a little squirrelly, but seems like a good kid.
Yeah.
So how's Julie taking all this?
Not well.
She accused me of not being a good mother.
Oh, you're a great mom.
Well, she was sort of right.
After my divorce, I really leaned on her a lot.
Seems natural.
And I still kind of do it.
I just want somebody to talk to about all my adult stuff, and she's right there, and she just acts so mature.
I forget she's 13.
Well, the good news is that from now on, if you ever want to talk to somebody about grown-up stuff, you got me.
Well, I can't talk to you about everything.
Oh.
What if I want to talk about the big crush I have on the plumber that lives across the street?
Big crush, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Wow, you'd have to tell me more.
Well, um... he's got a smile that's to die for, and don't get me started on his tattoo.
Thanks.
Oh, Bree.
What a-a nice surprise.
Would you like to come in?
Well, that depends.
Are you having an affair with my husband?
Would you like some more potatoes?
You already asked me that.
Sorry.
I'm so relieved you're safe, I'm, uh...
I'm not thinking straight.
Does that mean you're not going to send me back to silvercrest?
You've got to understand, your behavior, the violence, breaking into the Van De Kamps' --
I just didn't know what you were going through.
You could have asked me.
Well...
I've been remembering things... things from when I was little.
What kind of things?
Awful things.
Zach, listen to me.
Sometimes it's not good to look back on the past.
But I can't help it.
These images just keep popping into my head.
Well, then, you've got to find a way to push them back out again.
Okay.
More potatoes?
Yes, please.
Sure is nice to be back to normal.
You should know that Rex still loves you... very much.
He said that?
Yes.
Then why is he so unhappy?
He has certain needs, and he's afraid to discuss them with you.
Needs -- like... sexual needs?
Yes.
And have you fulfilled those needs?
I see.
You know, you are pretty brazen for a woman who just admitted, however tacitly, that she just slept with my husband.
If I told anyone in this neighborhood, they would never speak to you again.
You're not going to tell a soul.
Yeah, you may hate me, but you'd hate the humiliation a lot more.
Oh, I don't hate you, Maisy.
I pity you.
Hi.
Oh, hey, Lynette.
Are you heading out now?
Yep.
Um, I'll be home late, so just the usual routine -- a nap for penny, and --
I know, no sugar after 5:00.
I got it.
You're the best.
Oh, one more thing.
Since the boys are having corn dogs for dinner,
I'd like you to make sure they get a vegetable to go with it.
Brussels sprouts?
They're full of iron.
Would you make sure they clean their plates?
Not a problem.
I have this little trick I do.
I cover the veggies with some cheese.
Ooh, you sly dog.
That night, Lynette settled in to watch her personal pick for feel-good movie of the year.
You guys, you need to eat your brussels sprouts.
Brussels sprouts!
I don't want this!
Hey!
Yes, you do!
You guys, don't throw them -- hey!
Hey, stop it!
Do not -- ow!
Hey!
You guys, stop it!
Do not throw these at me, you guys!
Cut it out!
Hey.
Hey.
I guess they operated, huh?
They sure did.
How' d it go?
It went well.
The surgeon says you're going to be as good as new.
You look like you've been crying.
I have.
I was so afraid you were going to die.
There's so many things I haven't had a chance to tell you.
I'm sorry you were so worried.
It's okay.
How are you now, Rex?
Are you strong enough to listen to the things I need to tell you?
Sure, hon.
I know you still love me.
Maisy told me.
She did?
As of this moment, Rex,
I am no longer your wife.
I am going to go out and find the most vindictive lawyer can find, and together, we are going to eviscerate you.
I am going to take away your money, your family, and your dignity.
Do you hear me?
Bree -- and I am so thrilled to know that you still love me,
because I want what's about to happen to you... to hurt as much as is humanly possible.
I'm so glad you didn't die before I got a chance to tell you that.
Trust is a fragile thing.
Bye, guys.
- Bye, mom.
Bye, mom.
- Bye, mommy.
Once earned, it affords us tremendous freedom.
But once trust is lost, it can be impossible to recover.
[SOLOMON, MILLER HAAS FAMILY LAW]
Of course, the truth is we never know who we can trust.
Those we're closest to can betray us.
Police.
Open up.
And total strangers can come to our rescue.
In the end, most people decide to trust only themselves.
It really is the simplest way to keep from getting burned.
"Previously on" Desperate Housewives...
- Zach's gone from Silvercrest.
- Hungry?
Sometimes...
If I don't get help, I will lose my mind.
- Where can I score some nanny?
- "... no matter how hard you try..."
FBI!
Carlos Solis, I have a warrant for your arrest.
... some problems...
- Sorry, you are?
- You've met Maisy Gibbons?
- She's a nightmare.
- Maisy loves to rule her kingdom.
You are unhappy with our sex life.
You're not getting something but you're afraid to ask.
... can't be easily solved.
To understand Maisy Gibbons, you first need to know how she spent her afternoons.
Her mornings were spent running errands for her husband.
Hi.
Her evenings were spent helping with homework.
OK, so, nine plus one is...
But her afternoons, well, they were spent in the company of men.
Frustrated, misunderstood, lonely men, willing to pay money to feel a little less lonely.
And Maisy Gibbons was willing to help them.
Maisy, I've always wondered.
Nobody knows about your little hobby, do they?
- Mm-mm.
- Is it hard?
- Keeping a secret like this?
- Well, maybe if it was just my secret.
But the way I see it, I keep the secrets of every man who comes to me.
And I find that absolutely exhilarating.
A few years back, Harold lost his job and we had to give up our membership at the country club.
And then one day one of my club friends asked why she hadn't seen me around.
I told her that we couldn't afford it any more.
She waved it off like it was nothing, but I saw her get that look in her eye, that look of... pity.
Maybe she was just trying to be nice.
Anyway, is that so bad, feeling sorry for someone?
When they say something, they are being supportive, but when they say nothing, they think you're so far gone, you're never coming back.
Gotcha.
Anyway, a couple months later, I started my little hobby, and the most wonderful thing happened.
This woman's husband became one of my regulars.
Wow.
[Doorbell]
Oh, would you be a lamb and go out the back?
- That's my next appointment.
- Sure.
It's the husband of the woman I was telling you about.
- Hello, there.
- Hey, Maisy.
Every morality play has its cast of characters.
There is always an innocent victim, a deceitful villain, a prosecutor who seeks the truth, a magistrate who dispenses justice and a lawyer who charges too much.
This morality play was being produced at the Fairview County Courthouse.
Its themes were trust and betrayal.
So what's your issue with bail in this case, Ms McCready?
We want bail denied, Your Honor.
The company imported goods manufactured by slave labor.
His business partner, Mr. Tanaka, has fled the country, and Mr. Solis has refused to surrender his passport.
Dog ate your client's passport, Mr. Hartley?
It's been temporarily misplaced, but we maintain that Kisho Tanaka set up and executed the entire operation.
Mr. Solis is no business partner but merely a hired contractor.
I'd also like to point out my client is the sole provider for his wife and his mother, who is hospitalized in a coma as we speak.
Bring me the passport and Mr. Solis can visit his mother.
Until then, your client is denied bail and remanded.
What's next?
Finish those Brussels sprouts.
I can see them hidden under your macaroni.
I hate Brussels sprouts.
Well, Brussels sprouts help you grow.
You don't want to be short your whole life, do you?
You know what we'll do?
We're gonna dip 'em in a little cheese.
Here you go.
- Good.
Yummy.
- Disgusting!
Fine.
Be 3'8" the rest of your life.
See if I care.
Good luck finding girlfriends.
- Didn't you have a lunch?
- I'm gonna cancel it.
The boys are in rare form, and you're still finding your way.
Lynette, it's been two days.
I... don't want to shock them by suddenly disappearing.
- Deep down they're very sensitive.
- That's a paper airplane.
They'll be fine.
Now go.
Get out of here.
You call me if you need anything.
- I will.
- OK.
Boys!
Come here and give Momma a three-bear hug.
Come on.
Whoo!
One, two, three...
Get in!
Get in!
- [All] Bye, Mom.
- Bye.
- Bye!
- OK.
- [Susan giggles]
- Watch you hands!
I'm gonna eat upstairs.
I've got a ton of homework.
What, are you storing up for winter?
I'm just really hungry.
I talked to Dad, and he and Brandi might break up.
Oh, how awful.
- Mom, you're smiling.
- Am I?
Anyway, he can't take me this weekend, so I'll be home after all.
Goodnight.
Oh, great.
Our romantic weekend's off.
- We can move it to my house.
- No.
Why not?
I just want it to be special.
And it can't be special at my house?
OK, I know this sounds weird, but I just need to have my things around me.
- What things?
- Perfumes and oils.
I wanna pick out the outfit you're gonna tear off me.
And plus I need to be in complete control of the lighting.
OK.
We'll wait till next weekend.
You are just the sweetest guy.
- I can't wait till next weekend.
- No, me neither.
Tomorrow?
I've got an early job and that's it.
My publisher's got me under the gun for something.
Friday?
- I'm re-piping a house.
- Damn Karl!
Not even married any more and he's still keeping me from having sex.
I can't hide you in my room for ever, and I think we need to tell my mom.
You can trust her, I promise.
You didn't tell her what I told you?
No!
I would never tell anyone that.
- What are you doing?
- I don't wanna cause problems.
I'm just gonna go.
Zach, stop.
Don't go.
I won't tell her.
I swear I'll be out of here soon.
I'll think of something, OK?
- Hello.
- Why are you up?
I could ask you the same question.
I'm going to bed.
I didn't ask you to wait up for me.
Remember, I'm here as our children's father, not your husband.
What are you doing?
Were you with a woman?
Did you tell her you have a wife or does that hinder your style?
All right, even if I was seeing someone, I have every right to.
Exploring options is the point of being separated.
- Options!
I'm not a mutual fund, Rex.
- Oh, that's not...
Bree, you should get out there, try and meet someone.
Meet someone?
I'm raising your children.
I am just trying to move on with my life.
- It is nothing to be ashamed of.
- Oh, OK.
Why don't you just call up your mystery woman and invite her over?
I'll pull out the sofa bed and you can take her right there.
Andrew!
Danielle!
Daddy's gonna fornicate for us!
Just keep your voice down.
Why?
Are you feeling ashamed?
The next morning started with a banging.
No one knew where Martha Huber was, and Edie Britt was starting to worry.
Edie didn't like worrying.
She felt it gave her wrinkles.
So, out of concern for her face, and Mrs. Huber,
Edie decided to find out what was going on.
Yao Lin, listen.
It's very important that we find Carlos's passport.
I already looked through his office.
I need you to search the bedroom.
What?
With Mr. Solis in jail, how you gonna pay me?
I have children.
Yao Lin, your kids are in their twenties.
But if it'll make you shut up...
Here.
Three weeks in advance.
If you don't mind, can I call your bank?
Yao Lin, don't be stupid.
People don't become poor overnight.
That's my car.
Oh, my God.
Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing?
Where are you taking my car?
The government's impounding it.
Call that number if you have any questions.
Oh, my word.
You call this a paint job?
I don't want to see it again till it's perfect!
I wonder what's going on over there.
Claire did OK yesterday.
It could have been beginner's luck.
I should call.
For the first time in years you finally have some free time, and you're wasting it obsessing about the kids.
I don't know this woman.
So she has a degree in sociology.
Who doesn't?
My boys are a lot to handle.
What if she's not up to it?
If you really have that many doubts, you should go buy a hidden camera.
What, a nanny-cam?
Yeah.
People do terrible things when they think no one's watching.
Yeah.
I couldn't tape Claire.
It would be a breach of trust.
Trust is overrated.
So... how are things with you and Rex?
Fine.
Why do you ask?
I'm just curious.
He moves out, moves back in.
Is he back for good?
The situation is... fluid.
I'm not certain what his plans are yet.
Huh.
So if you're not sure he's back for good, why are you ironing his shirts?
Because I have faith that he'll come back and that he'll do the right thing.
That's good.
It's good to have faith in people.
Yeah.
But I'd still buy that camera.
- "Hello?"
- Mike?
My oven's out.
Come over and help me find my pilot light.
"[#" Al Green: "Here I Am]"
- "# Lay all my trouble down" - "# Down
# Here I am, baby Come and take me
# Here I am, baby Won't you come and take me?
# Take me by the hand
# Show me Here I am, baby... [squeals]
Oh, candles.
# Here I am, baby Come and take me
# Here I am, baby Come and take me...
# Take me by the hand [music continues]
Mike, is that you?
I'm up here!
Mike?
Ah!
- Oh, my God!
Oh, God.
- What the hell?
I'm so sorry.
I thought someone was in the house.
- So you took your clothes off?
- No, I was going to seduce you.
- Didn't really work.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you OK?
Well...
Please don't be mad.
Hey, there.
Zach?
What are you doing here?
Later that day, while Claire was out getting the boys wired on ice cream,
Lynette did some wiring of her own.
You can't do this.
You can't send Zach back.
What else can I do?
He can't stay here.
His father sent him to a psycho ward.
Actually, they call it a rehabilitation center.
- What do you think?
- Paul is his father.
He has a right to know his son's OK.
If he finds out you're hiding him, you could get in a lot of trouble.
He's right.
Sorry, guys.
Don't do this.
If you knew what Zach had been through...
Julie.
Julie, it's OK.
I'll be fine.
I'll take him back over so you two can...
Listen, if Paul sees Zach and freaks out...
- I'll bring him right back.
- Thank you.
Young lady, we need to talk about what you did.
I don't feel like talking to you right now.
Listen, Zach...
If things ever get really bad...
It's got my cell number on it.
Give me a call... any time.
Thanks.
Oh, thank God.
- How did you?
- We'll talk later.
Remember, any time.
- I heard you moved back home.
- Yeah, I had to.
We had some problems with Andrew.
I'll move out eventually.
- Spikes or pearls?
- Your choice.
You know what I think?
You don't really want to leave her.
- Don't psychoanalyze me.
- You're still in love.
- I never said I wasn't.
- Why divorce?
So now you're rooting for us two crazy kids to work it out?
You know me.
I'm just a romantic at heart.
Scarves or cuffs?
Up to you.
Even if I could find a way to deal with
Bree's obsessive-compulsive thing, it's not the only problem.
As you know, I have certain needs.
Boots or stilettos?
Stilettos, please.
Why don't you just tell Bree what you need?
Tell her what you want.
- Because she'd say no.
- So?
I've said no to some things you've asked me to do.
Yeah, that's different.
I don't care if you reject me.
Rex, would you trust me on this?
Sometimes when you love somebody, you just gotta make sacrifices for them.
Love or passion.
That's an awful choice to make.
Yes, it is.
I have to warn you, this might hurt a little bit.
Ah!
How am I supposed to live without a car?
Tanaka's still at large and they want Carlos to flip on him.
This is their way of playing hardball.
I'm guessing that they're not done yet.
- Why?
What else could they take?
- Pretty much anything.
It's all fair game if they can trace it to ill-gotten gains.
No, some of this stuff is mine, when I modeled, before I even met Carlos.
See this?
Kosta Boda.
I bought it when I landed my first cover.
This...
I spent eight hours on a rock in a bikini for that painting.
- I understand how you feel.
- You don't.
I have dug myself up from dirt to afford these things and no one is gonna take them away.
Then find a good hiding place.
They can't take what they can't find.
And if you can scare up that passport, that would be good.
[Doorbell]
- Oh.
Hi, Gabrielle.
- Hi.
- What have you got there?
- My china.
You've always loved it.
I thought you might wanna borrow it for a while.
Oh.
Well, that's...
very thoughtful of you.
Say, can I store some odds and ends in your garage?
Sure.
Why don't you come by tomorrow?
Sooner's better than later.
[Rex grunting]
- [Rex] Just like...
- [Maisy] Come on now.
[Rex] Yes!
Ah!
[Rex gasps for breath]
- Rex?
- [Thud]
- Rex?
- [Gasps]
Rex!
I need an ambulance... right away.
[Phone rings]
Hello?
Yes, this is she.
Yes, he's my husband.
I'm here to see Rex Van de Kamp.
Apparently he had a heart attack.
He's being prepped for surgery now.
Could I at least poke my head in?
I'm his wife.
- You're his wife?
- Yes.
Why?
I was thinking of a different patient.
Let me get the doctor.
As Claire prepared for bed, she was unaware that somewhere else in the Scavo house the day she had just finished was starting all over again.
Lynette was relieved to see that Claire was doing a good job.
[Squeals of delight]
[Cheering]
[Barks]
- "After further viewing..."
- Three-bear hug.
... it dawned on Lynette Claire might be doing herjob a little too well.
Here's the candles I borrowed.
Thanks.
I'm trying to read, if you don't mind.
I cannot believe, after everything you did, you're mad at me.
I told Zach that he could trust you and you turned him in.
Well, someone had to be responsible.
Like it or not, I've got a birth certificate that says I'm your mother.
- Since when?
- What is that supposed to mean?
Since Dad left, if there's been a mother here, it's been me.
Julie!
After the divorce you stayed in bed for a week and I had to beg you to eat.
Yeah, but...
I had to clean the house, make sure the bills were paid, even schedule my doctor's appointment.
- I was in bad shape back then.
- It's still going on.
And now that I need some support, you decide to play the mom card?
I had to send Zach back.
We could have gotten in a lot of trouble.
Now Zach's the one who's in trouble.
You sent him back to a man who hates him.
As Gabrielle considered the vast emptiness of her new surroundings, she was surprised to find there was only one thing she truly missed her husband.
[Doorbell]
We have a warrant to enter your house and repossess any goods we suspect may have been obtained... illegally.
We're not into clutter.
All "right.
Harvey The Flying Turtle." Doesn't this look fun?
- Where's Claire?
- I gave her the afternoon off.
- Who wants to turn pages?
- Is she sick?
No.
I just wanted us all to spend the day together, like we used to.
Here we go. "Once upon a time there was a young turtle named Harvey."
"Harvey told the other turtles 'I'm going to fly off and see the world."'
"The other turtles said 'Turtles can't fly!"'
It's getting good now, huh?
- Well, what's wrong?
- Claire does funny voices.
Does she, now?
OK.
"Harvey didn't like the turtles laughing so he told them [squawking] 'I'll show you!
I will fly higher than the birds."'
- That's not funny.
- Yeah, well, I'm just warming up.
"Bruno, the big bad turtle, took Harvey up on the cliff and threw him over."
"He proclaimed 'We'll see if you can fly!
Fly or die!
Fly or die!"'
When's Claire coming back?
What happened to your nails?
Oh, I...
I moved all our stuff to keep it from the Feds.
It kills me that I'm putting you through this.
Hands on the table.
It's not your fault.
You didn't do anything wrong.
I'll take care of everything until you're back to do it yourself.
And you will be soon.
I gotta be honest.
I didn't know how you would hold up.
I knew you were a strong woman, but I had no idea.
You're a good wife, Gaby.
A real partner.
Oh, Carlos, I love you so much.
I would give up a houseful of expensive junk just to put this behind us and have you home with me.
That sounds pretty good right now.
- I'm gonna kiss my husband now.
- Hands on the table.
There's a false panel on the back wall of my closet.
My passport is there, along with some papers.
Take the passport to the lawyer and burn the papers.
Carlos, did you know what Tanaka was doing?
Just burn the papers.
Hey, Lynette.
Did Martha Huber leave a spare key to her house with you?
No.
Where is she, by the way?
I haven't seen her in days.
You got me.
She kicked me out so fast that I forgot my laptop, and there's just some stuff on there that I don't want anyone else to see.
Oh.
Well, good luck with that.
You're not looking half bad.
What have you done with your little posse?
- They're with the new nanny.
- Wow.
Your own personal nanny?
Smell you.
Trust me, it's not all it's cracked up to be.
Our mothers didn't get us nannies or put us in daycare because they knew if they did we'd find out there are other women out there who were better mothers than they were.
I had a nanny for a while growing up.
- Mrs. Muntz.
- You had a nanny?
Well, actually, she was more like a court-appointed social worker.
My mom did a little time.
She had a thing for bourbon and... shoplifting.
Oh.
Sorry.
Muntz was a hard-ass.
No mercy.
In fact, she was such a disciplinarian that when my mom made parole,
I was actually happy to see her.
Really?
Yeah.
Lesser of two evils.
- Huh.
- Anyway, I gotta find a key.
- See you later.
- Bye.
Thanks for your help with Zach before.
It's my pleasure.
I hope he comes out of this OK.
He's a little squirrelly, but he seems like a good kid.
Yeah.
So, how's Julie taking all this?
Not well.
She accused me of not being a good mother.
No, you're a great mom.
Well, she was sort of right.
After my divorce, I really leaned on her a lot.
Seems natural.
And I still kinda do it.
I just want somebody to talk to about all my adult stuff, and she's right there, and she just acts so mature,
I forget she's thirteen.
Well, the good news is that from now on, if you ever want to talk to somebody about grown-up stuff, you got me.
I can't talk to you about everything.
Oh?
What if I want to talk about the big crush I have on the plumber that lives across the street?
- Big crush, huh?
- Oh, yeah.
Well, you'd have to tell me more.
Well... he's got a smile that's to die for.
And don't get me started on his tattoo.
Thanks.
[Doorbell]
Oh, Bree.
What a nice surprise.
Would you like to come in?
Well, that depends.
Are you having an affair with my husband?
- Would you like some more potatoes?
- You already asked me that.
Sorry.
I'm so relieved you're safe, I'm not thinking straight.
Does that mean you're not gonna send me back to Silvercrest?
You've gotta understand, your behavior, the violence, breaking into the Van De Kamps...
I just didn't know what you were going through.
You could have asked me.
Well...
I've been remembering things.
Things from when I was little.
- What kind of things?
- Awful things.
Zach, listen to me.
Sometimes it's not good to look back on the past.
But I can't help it.
These images just keep popping into my head.
You've got to find a way to push them back out again.
OK.
More potatoes?
Yes, please.
Sure is nice to be back to normal.
You should know that Rex still loves you... very much.
- He said that?
- Yes.
[Sighs]
Then why is he so unhappy?
He has certain needs, and he's afraid to discuss them with you.
Needs?
Like... sexual needs?
Yes.
And have you fulfilled those needs?
I see.
You are pretty brazen for a woman who just admitted, however tacitly, that she just slept with my husband.
If I told anyone, they would never speak to you again.
You're not gonna tell a soul.
Yeah, you may hate me, but you'd hate the humiliation a lot more.
Oh, I don't hate you, Maisy.
I pity you.
- Hi.
- Oh, hey, Lynette.
- You heading out now?
- Yep.
I'll be home late, so just the usual routine.
- A nap for Penny and...
- No sugar after five.
I got it.
You're the best.
Oh, one more thing.
Since the boys are having corndogs for dinner,
I'd like you to make sure they get a vegetable to go with it.
- Brussels sprouts?
- They're full of iron.
- Make sure they clean their plates.
- Not a problem.
I have this trick.
- I cover the veggies with some cheese.
- Ooh.
You sly dog.
That night Lynette settled in to watch her personal pick for feel-good movie of the year.
You need to eat your Brussels sprouts.
- Brussels sprouts?
Disgusting!
- I don't want this!
Hey!
Yes, you do!
Don't throw them.
- Hey!
Hey, stop it!
- I hate Brussels sprouts!
You guys, stop it!
- Do not throw them at me.
Cut it out!
- [Children yelling]
[Monitor bleeps]
Hey.
Hey.
They operated, huh?
They sure did.
How'd it go?
It went well.
The surgeon says you're gonna be as good as new.
- You look like you've been crying.
- I have.
I was so afraid you were gonna die.
There's so many things I haven't had a chance to tell you.
- I'm sorry you were so worried.
- That's OK.
How are you now, Rex?
Are you strong enough to listen to the things I need to tell you?
Sure, hon.
I know you still love me.
Maisy told me.
She did?
As of this moment, Rex, I am no longer your wife.
I am gonna go out and find the most vindictive lawyer I can find, and together we are going to eviscerate you.
I am gonna take away your money, your family and your dignity.
- Do you hear me?
- Bree...
And I am so thrilled to know that you still love me.
Because I want what's about to happen to you to hurt as much as is humanly possible.
I'm so glad you didn't die before I got a chance to tell you that.
Trust is a fragile thing.
- Bye, guys!
- Bye, Mom!
Once earned, it affords us tremendous freedom.
But once trust is lost, it can be impossible to recover.
Of course, the truth is, we never know who we can trust.
Those we're closest to can betray us.
Police, open up!
And total strangers can come to our rescue.
In the end, most people decide to trust only themselves.
It really is the simplest way to keep from getting burned.
Zach's gone from silvercrest.
hungry?
Sometimes...
If I don't get some help, I will lose my mind.
Where can I score some high-grade nanny?
No matter how hard you try...
FBI.
Open the door.
Carlos Solis, I have a warrant for your arrest.
Some problems...
I'm sorry.
And you are?
I take it you've met Maisy Gibbons.
She's a total nightmare.
Maisy does love to rule her little kingdom.
You are unhappy with our sex life.
You're not getting something from me, but you're simply too afraid to ask.
Can't be easily solved.
To understand Maisy Gibbons, you first need to know how she spent her afternoons.
Her mornings were spent running errands for her husband.
Hi.
Her evenings were spent washing dishes and helping with homework.
Okay, so 9 plus 1 is... but her afternoons -- well, they were spent in the company of men.
Frustrated... misunderstood... lonely men willing to pay money to feel a little less lonely.
And Maisy Gibbons was willing to help them.
Maisy, I've always wondered, nobody knows about your little hobby, do t
Is it hard keeping a secret like this?
Well, maybe if it was just my secret, but the way I see it, I keep the secrets of every man who comes to me, and I find that absolutely exhilarating.
A few years back, Harold lost his job, and we had to give up our membership at the country club.
And then one day, one of my club friends asked why she hadn't seen me around lately, and I told her that we couldn't afford it anymore.
She waved it off like it was nothing, but I saw her get that look in her eye, that look of pity.
Maybe she was just trying to be nice.
Anyway, is that so bad, feeling sorry for someone?
Well, when they say something, they are being supportive, but when they say nothing,
it's because they think that you're so far gone, you're never coming back.
Gotcha.
Anyway, a couple of months later,
I started my little hobby, and the most wonderful thing happened.
This woman's husband became one of my regulars.
Would you be a lamb and go out the back?
It's my next appointment.
Sure.
It's the husband of the woman I was telling you about.
Hello there.
Hey, Maisy.
Episode 10 :
Come Back to Me
Every morality play has its cast of characters.
There is always an innocent victim, a deceitful villain, a prosecutor who seeks the truth, a magistrate who dispenses justice, and a lawyer who charges too much.
This morality play was being produced at the fairview county courthouse.
Its themes were trust and betrayal.
So what's your issue with bail in this case, Ms. Mcready?
We want bail denied, your honor.
The defendant's company imported goods manufactured by slave labor, and his business partner Mr. Tanaka has already fled the country, and Mr. Solis himself has refused to surrender his passport.
Dog ate your client's passport, Mr. Hartley?
It's been temporarily misplaced, your honor, but we maintain that Kisho Tanaka set up and executed the entire operation.
Mr. Solis is no business partner, but merely a hired contractor.
And I'd also like to point out that my client is the sole provider for his wife and his mother, who is hospitalized in a coma as we speak.
Bring me the passport, and Mr. Solis can visit his mother.
Until then, your client is denied bail and remanded.
What's next?
You better finish those brussels sprouts.
And don't think I can't see them hidden under your macaroni.
I hate brussels sprouts.
Yeah, well, brussels sprouts help you grow.
You don't want to be short your whole life, do you?
Here, look, you know what we'll do?
We're going to dip them in a little cheese.
Here you go.
Good.
Yummy.
Yummy.
Fine, fine, be 3'8" the rest of your life.
See if I care.
Good luck finding girlfriends.
Hey, didn't you have a lunch today?
I'm going to cancel it.
The boys are in rare form, and you're still finding your way.
Lynette, it's been two days.
I don't want to shock them by suddenly disappearing.
You know, deep down, they're very sensitive.
They'll be fine.
Now go.
Get out of here.
You have my cell phone number.
You call me if you need anything.
I will.
Okay.
You boys, come here and give mama a 3-bear hug.
Come on.
Whoo!
1, 2, 3.
Whoa!
Get in, get in.
- Mm, okay.
- Bye.
- Bye, mom!
- Bye.
Bye!
Okay.
Watch your hands.
I'm going to eat upstairs.
I've got a ton of homework.
What are you, storing up for winter?
I'm just really hungry.
Oh, I talked to dad today, and apparently, he and Brandi might break up.
Oh.
How awful.
Mom, you're smiling.
Am I?
Anyway, because of all the drama, he can't take me this weekend, so I'll be home after all.
Good night.
Oh, great.
Our romantic weekend's off.
We could move it to my house.
No.
Why not?
I just want it to be special.
And it can't be special at my house.
Okay, I know this sounds weird, but I just need to have my things around me.
What things?
Perfumes and oils, and I want to pick out the outfit that you're going to tear off me.
And plus, I need to be in complete control of the lighting.
Okay.
We'll wait till next weekend.
You are just the sweetest guy.
All right.
I can't wait till next weekend.
No, me neither.
What about tomorrow while Julie's at school?
I've got an early job, and that's it.
Oh, no good.
My publisher's got me under the gun for something.
What about friday?
I'm repiping a house.
Damn Karl.
I'm not even married to him anymore, and he's still keeping me from having sex.
I can't hide you in my room forever, and...
I think we need to tell my mom.
You can trust her, I promise.
You didn't tell her what I told you, did you?
No.
No, no, no.
I would never tell anyone that.
What are you doing?
I don't want to cause problems for you.
I'm just going to go.
Zach, stop.
Don't go.
I won't tell her.
I swear, I'll be out of here soon.
I'll think of something, okay?
Hello.
Why are you up?
I could ask you the same question.
I'm going to bed.
I didn't ask you to wait up for me.
Remember, I'm here as our children's father, not your husband.
What are you doing?
Were you with a woman?
Did you tell her that you have a wife, or does that hinder your pickup style?
All right.
Even if I was seeing someone, I have every right to.
Exploring options is the whole point of being separated.
"Options"?
I'm not a mutual fund, Rex.
Oh, that's not --
Bree, you should get out there.
Try and meet someone.
Meet someone.
I'm raising your children.
I am just trying to move on with my life.
It is nothing to be ashamed of.
Oh, okay.
I tell you what, then -- why don't you just call up your mystery woman and invite her over?
I'll pull out the sofa bed, and you can take her right there.
Andrew, Danielle, daddy's going to fornicate for us!
Just keep your voice down.
Why?
Are you feeling ashamed?
The next morning started with a banging.
No one knew where Martha Huber was, and Edie Britt was starting to worry.
Edie didn't like worrying.
She felt it gave her wrinkles.
So out of concern for her face and Mrs. Huber, Edie decided to find out what was going on.
Yao lin, listen to me.
It's very important that we find Carlos's passport.
I already looked through his office, so I need you to search the bedroom.
What?
With Mr. Solis in jail, how are you going to pay me?
I have children.
Yao lin, your kids are in their 20s.
If it'll make you shut up... here.
Three weeks in advance.
If you don't mind, can I call your bank?
Yao lin, don't be stupid.
People don't become poor overnight.
That's my car.
Oh, my God
What are you doing?
Where are you taking my car?
Government's impounding it.
Here's your receipt.
Call that number if you have any questions.
You call this a paint job?
I don't want to see it again until it's perfect!
Wonder what's going on over there.
I mean, Claire did okay with the kids yesterday, but that could have been beginner's luck.
You think I should call?
I should call.
Lynette, for the first time in years, you finally have some free time, and you're wasting it obsessing about the kids.
It's just I don't know this woman.
I mean, not really.
So she has a degree in sociology.
Well, big deal.
Who doesn't?
My boys are a lot to handle.
What if she's not up to it?
You know, if you really have that many doubts, you should go buy a hidden camera.
What, a nanny-cam?
People do terrible things when they think no one's watching them.
Yeah.
I don't really think I could videotape Claire.
It would be a breach of trust.
Trust is overrated.
So...how are things with you and Rex?
Fine.
Why do you ask?
Well, I'm just curious.
I mean, he moves out, moves back in.
Is he back for good?
The situation is fluid.
I'm not certain what his plans are yet.
So if you're not sure he's back for good, why are you ironing his shirts?
Because I have faith that he'll come back and that he'll do the right thing.
That's good.
It's good to have faith in people.
Yeah.
But I'd still buy that camera.
Hello?
- Mike?
- Yeah?
My oven's out.
Come over and help me find my pilot light.
Al green's "here I am (come and take me)"
Laying all my troubles down here I am, baby come and take me here I am, baby ooh, come and take me take me by the hand ooh, yeah, show me here I am, baby
Oh, candles, candles.
Mike, is that you?
nbsp;
I'm up here.
I can always call you for a helpin' hand
I know you'll do the best you can but it don't take much from me
Mike?
Oh, my God.
What the hell?
I'm so sorry.
I thought there was someone in the house.
So you took your clothes off?
No, my clothes were already off.
I was going to seduce you.
It didn't really work.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
nbsp;
Well... please don't be mad.
hey there.
Zach.
What are you doing here?
Later that day, while Claire was out getting the boys wired on ice cream,
Lynette did some wiring of her own.
No, you can't do this.
You can't send Zach back.
Julie, what else can I do?
He can't stay here.
His father sent him to a psycho ward.
Actually, they call it a rehabilitation center.
What do you think?
Paul is his father.
He has a right to know his son's okay.
And if he finds out you're hiding him, you could get in a lot of trouble.
He's right.
Sorry, guys.
Mom, please don't do this.
If you knew what Zach had been through --
Julie, Julie, it's okay.
I'll be fine.
I'll take him back over so you two can... listen, if Paul sees Zach and freaks out --
I'll bring him right back.
Thank you.
Young lady, we need to talk about what you did.
I really don't feel like talking to you right now.
Listen, Zach... if things ever get really bad... it's got my cell number on it.
You give me a call... anytime.
Thanks.
Oh, thank God.
How did you -- we'll talk later.
Remember, anytime.
I heard you moved back home.
Yeah, I had to.
We had some problems with Andrew.
I'll move out eventually.
Spikes or pearls?
Your choice.
You know what I think?
You don't really want to leave her.
Please don't psycho analyze me.
Well, you're still in love with her.
I never said I wasn't.
Then why divorce?
Now you're rooting for us two crazy kids to work it out?
Hey
You know me.
I'm just a romantic at heart.
Scarves or cuffs?
Up to you.
Even if I could find a way to deal with Bree's whole obsessive-compulsive thing, it's not the only problem in our marriage.
As you know, I have certain needs.
Boots or stilettos?
Stilettos... please.
Why don't you just tell Bree what you need?
Tell her what you want.
Because she'd say no.
So?
I've said no to some things you've asked me to do.
Yeah, that's different.
I don't care if you reject me.
Rex... do you trust me on this?
Sometimes when you love somebody, you've just got to make sacrifices for them.
Love or passion -- it's an awful choice to make.
Yes, it is.
Now, I have to warn you -- this might hurt a little bit.
How am I supposed to live without a car?
Okay, Gabrielle, listen.
Tanaka's still at large, and they're going to want Carlos to flip on him, so this is their way of playing hardball.
Now, I'm guessing that they're not done yet.
Why?
What else could they take from us?
Pretty much anything.
It's all fair game if they even think they can trace it to ill-gotten gains.
No, no, no.
No, some of this stuff is mine when I modeled, before I even met Carlos.
See this?
Kosta boda.
Bought it when I landed my first cover.
This -
- I spent eight hours on a rock in a bikini for that painting.
I understand how you feel -- no, you don't understand.
I have dug myself up from dirt to afford these things, and no one is going to take them away from me.
Then I suggest you find yourself a good hiding place.
They can't take what they can't find.
Oh, and if you can scare up that passport, too, that would be good.
- Oh, hi, Gabrielle.
- Hi.
What have you got there?
My china.
I know how you've always loved it, and I thought you might want to borrow it for a while.
Well, that's, um, very thoughtful of you.
Say, um, can I store some odds and ends in your garage?
Sure.
Why don't you, uh, come by tomorrow?
Sooner is better than later, right?
Just like...
Come on now.
Yes!
Rex?
Rex?
I need an ambulance.
Right away.
Hello?
Yes, this is she.
Yes, he's my husband.
Excuse me.
I'm here to see Rex Van De Kamp.
Apparently, he had a heart attack.
I'm not sure -- he's being prepped for surgery right now.
If you'd like to wait... could I at least poke my head in?
I'm his wife.
You're his wife?
Yes.
Why?
I was thinking of a different patient.
Let me get the doctor.
[Rex Van De Kamp]
[Maisy Gibbons]
As Claire prepared for bed, she was unaware that somewhere else in the Scavo house, the day she had just finished was starting all over again.
The dog is blue, the doggie is blue
Lynette was relieved to see that Claire was doing a good job.
But after further viewing... come give me a 3-bear hug.
It dawned on Lynette...
Claire might be doing her job a little too well.
Here's the candles I borrowed.
Thanks.
I'm trying to read, so if you don't mind...
I cannot believe, after everything you did, you're mad at me.
I told Zach that he could trust you, and you turned him in.
Yeah, well, someone had to be responsible, and like it or not,
I've got a birth certificate that says I'm your mother.
Since when?
What is that supposed to mean?
Since dad left, if there's been a mother around here, it's been me.
Julie.
Do you remember after the divorce that you stayed in bed for a week and I had to beg you to eat something?
Yeah, but -- and for weeks, I had to clean the house, I had to make sure that the bills were paid.
I even had to schedule my own doctor's appointment once.
I was in bad shape back then.
It's still going on.
And now that I need some support, you decide to play the mom card?
I had to send Zach back.
We could have gotten in a lot of trouble.
Yeah, well, now Zach's the one who's in trouble.
You sent him back to a man who hates him.
As gabrielle considered the vast emptiness of her new surroundings, she was surprised to find there was only one thing she truly missed -- her husband.
Mrs. Solis, we have a warrant to enter your house and repossess any goods which we suspect may have been obtained...illegally.
We're not into clutter.
All right,"harvey the flying turtle." Doesn't this look fun.
Where's Claire?
I gave her the afternoon off.
Who wants to turn pages?
Is she sick?
No, she's fine.
I just wanted us all to spend the day together, you know?
Like we used to.
Here we go.
"Once upon a time, there was a young turtle named harvey.
"Every day, harvey would tell all the other turtles,
"'one day, I'm going to fly off this island "and go see the world.
'The other turtles laughed and said,'turtles can't fly.'"
Ooh, it's getting good now, huh?
What's wrong?
When Claire reads, she does funny voices.
Does she, now?
Okay.
"Harvey didn't like the turtles laughing, "so he told them,
'I'll show you.
One day I will fly higher than the birds.'"
That's not funny.
Yeah?
Well, I'm just warming up.
"Then bruno, the big, bad turtle, "took harvey up on the cliff and threw him over, "and he proclaimed,
"'we'll see if you can fly.
Fly or die, fly or die.'"
When's Claire coming back?
What happened to your nails?
I moved all our stuff to keep it from the feds.
It kills me that I'm putting you through this.
Hands on the table.
It's not your fault.
You didn't do anything wrong.
I'll take care of everything until you're back to do it yourself.
And you will be soon.
I got to be honest, I didn't know how you would hold up.
I knew you were a strong woman, but I had no idea.
You're a good wife, gabby, a real partner.
Oh, Carlos, I love you so much.
I would give up that house full of expensive junk just to put this behind us and have you home with me.
That sounds pretty good right now.
I'm going to kiss my husband now.
Hands on the table.
There's a false panel on the back wall of my closet.
My passport is there, along with some papers.
Take the passport to the lawyer and burn the papers.
Carlos, did you know what Tanaka was doing?
Just burn... the papers.
Hey, Lynette.
Did Martha Huber happen to leave a spare key to her house with you?
No.
Where is she, by the way?
I haven't seen her in days.
Got me.
She kicked me out so fast that I forgot my laptop, and there's just some stuff on there that I don't want anyone else to see.
Oh.
Well... good luck with that.
You know, you're not looking half bad.
What have you done with that little posse of yours?
They're with the new nanny.
Wow, your own personal nanny?
Smell you.
Well, trust me, it's not all it's cracked up to be.
You know, our mothers were smart.
They didn't get us nannies or put us in day care because they knew if they did, we'd find out there are other women out there who are better mothers than they were.
You know, I had a nanny for a while growing up -
- Mrs. Muntz.
You had a nanny?
Well, actually, she was more like a court-appointed social worker.
My mom did a little time.
She had a thing for bourbon and shoplifting.
Sorry.
Muntz was a hard-ass --no mercy.
In fact, she was such a disciplinarian that when my mom made parole,
I was actually happy to see her.
Really?
Yeah.
Lesser of two evils.
Anyway, I got to find a key.
- See you later.
- Bye.
Thanks for your help with Zach before.
Oh, it's my pleasure.
I hope he comes out of this okay.
He's a little squirrelly, but seems like a good kid.
Yeah.
So how's Julie taking all this?
Not well.
She accused me of not being a good mother.
Oh, you're a great mom.
Well, she was sort of right.
After my divorce, I really leaned on her a lot.
Seems natural.
And I still kind of do it.
I just want somebody to talk to about all my adult stuff, and she's right there, and she just acts so mature.
I forget she's 13.
Well, the good news is that from now on, if you ever want to talk to somebody about grown-up stuff, you got me.
Well, I can't talk to you about everything.
What if I want to talk about the big crush I have on the plumber that lives across the street?
Big crush?
Oh, yeah.
You'd have to tell me more.
Well... he's got a smile that's to die for, and don't get me started on his tattoo.
Thanks.
Oh, Bree.
What a nice surprise.
Would you like to come in?
Well, that depends.
Are you having an affair with my husband?
Would you like some more potatoes?
You already asked me that.
Sorry.
I'm so relieved you're safe, I'm...
I'm not thinking straight.
Does that mean you're not going to send me back to silvercrest?
You've got to understand, your behavior, the violence, breaking into the Van De Kamps' --
I just didn't know what you were going through.
You could have asked me.
Well...
I've been remembering things... things from when I was little.
What kind of things?
Awful things.
Zach, listen to me.
Sometimes it's not good to look back on the past.
But I can't help it.
These images just keep popping into my head.
Well, then, you've got to find a way to push them back out again.
Okay.
More potatoes?
Yes, please.
Sure is nice to be back to normal.
You should know that Rex still loves you... very much.
He said that?
Yes.
Then why is he so unhappy?
He has certain needs, and he's afraid to discuss them with you.
Needs -- like... sexual needs?
Yes.
And have you fulfilled those needs?
I see.
You know, you are pretty brazen for a woman who just admitted, however tacitly, that she just slept with my husband.
If I told anyone in this neighborhood, they would never speak to you again.
You're not going to tell a soul.
Yeah, you may hate me, but you'd hate the humiliation a lot more.
I don't hate you, Maisy.
I pity you.
Hi.
Oh, hey, Lynette.
Are you heading out now?
I'll be home late, so just the usual routine -- a nap for penny, and --
I know, no sugar after 5:00.
I got it.
You're the best.
Oh, one more thing.
Since the boys are having corn dogs for dinner,
I'd like you to make sure they get a vegetable to go with it.
Brussels sprouts?
They're full of iron.
Would you make sure they clean their plates?
Not a problem.
I have this little trick I do.
I cover the veggies with some cheese.
Ooh, you sly dog.
That night, Lynette settled in to watch her personal pick for feel-good movie of the year.
You guys, you need to eat your brussels sprouts.
Brussels sprouts!
I don't want this!
You guys, don't throw them -- hey!
Hey, stop it!
Do not !
Hey!
You guys, stop it!
Do not throw these at me, you guys!
Cut it out!
I guess they operated, huh?
They sure did.
How' d it go?
It went well.
The surgeon says you're going to be as good as new.
You look like you've been crying.
I have.
I was so afraid you were going to die.
There's so many things I haven't had a chance to tell you.
I'm sorry you were so worried.
It's okay.
How are you now, Rex?
Are you strong enough to listen to the things I need to tell you?
;
Sure, hon.
I know you still love me.
Maisy told me.
She did?
As of this moment, Rex,
I am no longer your wife.
I am going to go out and find the most vindictive lawyer can find, and together, we are going to eviscerate you.
I am going to take away your money, your family, and your dignity.
Do you hear me?
Bree -- and I am so thrilled to know that you still love me,
because I want what's about to happen to you... to hurt as much as is humanly possible.
I'm so glad you didn't die before I got a chance to tell you that.
Trust is a fragile thing.
Bye, guys.
- Bye, mom.
Bye, mom.
- Bye, mommy.
Once earned, it affords us tremendous freedom.
But once trust is lost, it can be impossible to recover.
SOLOMON, MILLER HAAS FAMILY LAW
Of course, the truth is we never know who we can trust.
Those we're closest to can betray us.
Police.
Open up.
And total strangers can come to our rescue.
In the end, most people decide to trust only themselves.
It really is the simplest way to keep from getting burned.
Your liquor license is expired.
It's probably all right.
My name is Adrian Monk.
I'm meeting someone.
Mr. Monk?
Thank you for coming.
Sit down.
I know your work.
I'm a big fan.
There's, uh, more light over there.
I prefer the dark.
You obviously got my note.
And the money.
$500 to meet you alone, ten minutes.
It's very generous.
There's more where that came from.
I have a job to offer you, Mr. Monk.
It will take you one night.
Not even one night.
Two hours.
I'm willing to pay you $20,000 for your trouble.
My name is Derek Bronson.
Bronson?
Bronson Technologies.
I thought he...
- You...
- You thought I was dead.
Most days, I wish I was.
I was ballooning solo up the coast.
I'd done it a thousand times.
That day, seven years ago, the trade wind shifted.
Everybody assumed I was lost at sea.
Actually, I landed on a small island west of Guam.
And you stayed there for seven years?
I could've come back years ago.
But...
I got sick.
Would you like to hear about the job?
Yes, of course.
But first, I have a couple of questions.
Sick is a funny word.
Could mean anything from a mild headache to...
When I say sick,
I mean sick.
Mr. Monk...
I am a leper.
There you are.
I was getting worried about you.
Just get in.
Get in.
Start the car!
Well, what happened?
Tell you later.
Let's get out of here.
What are you doing?
Unlock the door!
- It's a new car.
- Natalie.
Please!
It must be this button.
I don't know.
Forget it!
Oh, wait.
Mr. Monk, where are you going?
I'll meet you back at the house.
Wait, Mr. Monk.
I got it, I got it, I got it.
Mr. Monk, I got it.
I got it!
Any more soap?
That's it.
No, I mean is there any more soap in San Francisco?
Mr. Monk, you've been scrubbing your hand for nine hours.
I'm surprised you have any skin left.
It's not coming out.
I can still feel it.
I think it's spreading.
What are you doing?
Is that kerosene?
Light me.
What?
For the love of God, light me!
Okay, Mr. Monk, I'm not gonna light your hand on fire.
Fine.
You know what?
Get out...
You are overreacting, all right?
All you did was shake a man's hand.
You're right.
You know what?
I'm glad it happened.
The worst possible thing that could ever happen to me has happened.
I shook hands... with a leper.
And I survived.
Exactly.
Worst moment of my life is behind me now.
I'm free.
Wait.
Okay, now I'm free.
Um, actually...
Mr. Monk, it's not completely over.
Uh, don't be mad.
But I talked to Mr. Bronson.
You did what?
What?
!
He called here this morning.
The leper?
!
He called me?
On what phone?
On this...
- On this phone?
- Yes.
Mr. Monk, you can't catch anything over the phone.
And now, all of the sudden, you're an expert on lepers?
You know, he's a nice man, all right?
He's in pain.
He was crying his eyes out.
And... okay, listen to me.
He upped his offer.
He said he would pay you $25,000.
All you have to do is meet him again.
Natalie, listen.
Let me explain something to you.
No!
That's it?
That's your argument?
Okay, let's go through it.
A, whatever he's asking us to do is probably illegal.
B through Z,
- the man is a leper!
- You know what?
I don't know anything about leprosy, and neither do you.
So I called a doctor.
He's a specialist.
He said we could come in and talk with him.
Let's just see what he recommends, okay?
I mean, it can't hurt to listen, right?
$25,000.
You okay?
Are you holding your breath?
Is that Randy?
Oh, my God.
That is so funny.
Not funny in a "Ha, ha" way, but funny in an "Oh, boy, this'll really embarrass him" way.
Miss Teeger?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm...
I'm Dr. Polanski.
Hi.
So... so nice to meet you.
This is my boss.
This is Adrian Monk.
Thank you for seeing us.
It won't take much of your time.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
- Oh, Doctor.
Can I ask you one thing?
- Certainly.
Right over here.
- Go ahead.
- Is that Randy Disher?
Yeah, Randy was one of my first patients.
Do you know him?
Uh, I know Randy Disher.
I don't know that kid.
Well, you know, teen years.
I don't know how any of us survived it.
We can talk over here.
Come on.
You're not gonna catch anything in here.
Promise.
Come on.
Now.
What can I do for you?
Could you explain to my friend that leprosy is a serious condition?
It's very contagious.
Well, actually, that's a common misconception.
- See?
- For one thing, it's not called leprosy anymore.
It's called Hansen's disease.
It's quite rare.
Most people are naturally immune to it.
And if you do happen to contract it, it's easily treatable with an antibiotic called halazzen.
See, I've been talking to this man.
He wants to hire us.
But he's allergic to halazzen.
Yes, that does happen.
Is his condition full-blown?
Oh, yes.
Ye... yes, yes.
Yes, full-blown.
Fullll...
- blown!
- Sir?
Full-blown.
I don't think you have to worry.
As I said, it's not very contagious.
I've been practicing for 15 years.
I've only seen one case first-hand.
I can't do it.
I just...
I...
I can't do it.
Well, how about this?
If you do contract the disease...
I'll treat you for free.
The hell are you talking about?
How 'bout this?
We never call the guy back.
We don't see him again.
I avoid him like the plague.
Yeah, you know what?
- Exactly like the plague.
- You know what?
Could I just talk to you for a second?
- Just excuse us.
- Please.
Mr. Monk.
- Did you hear what he just said?
- No.
He said it's almost impossible to catch.
Yeah.
In that sentence, for me, the word "almost" is really the most interesting word.
Okay, Mr. Bronson has an affliction.
He needs our compassion and understanding.
You know what?
Let me let you in on a little secret, Mr. Monk.
You're no picnic, either.
A lot of people would rather not deal with you, but they do.
They reach out to you.
And Mr. Bronson is offering us a lot of money to do the same thing.
And I've been talking to him.
You wouldn't even have to shake his hand.
Good.
Good.
Because I would rather die... than have to shake his hand again.
You don't even have to look at him.
All you have to do is go back to that bar and sit and listen to what he has to say.
You just sit there and listen.
Stop it.
Stop.
Thank you for coming, Mr. Monk.
I was afraid you wouldn't want to see me again.
Why would you think that?
My assistant is over there.
I know she'd like to meet you.
I'm sorry.
I can't bear to have a woman see me.
Not like this.
I'm hideous.
No.
I wouldn't say... hideous, exactly.
Believe it or not, women used to find me quite attractive.
I never went home alone.
After I married Mandy,
I resisted those kind of temptations.
At least, I usually resisted them.
Gah!
Oh, God.
- Have I offended you?
- No.
No, sorry.
You just leaned into the light.
Sorry.
I had an affair.
That was my first mistake.
She wrote me some letters, which I kept.
That was mistake number two.
In a week, there'll be a probate hearing.
I'll be officially declared dead.
The vultures are gonna go through my office, reading every file, opening every drawer.
They'll find the letters.
The letters themselves don't mean anything to me.
But they would destroy my wife.
Mr. Monk, I want to hire you to break into my home, find the letters, and bring them back.
That's the job?
It's still my house.
So you wouldn't be breaking any law.
Why don't you just do it yourself?
I tried.
I...
I just couldn't do it.
That house... that life, everything I've lost.
It's just... too painful.
I've drawn you a map.
Everything you need... the layout, the security codes.
I just have one question.
Why me?
I'm not a thief.
Exactly.
You're an honorable man.
You won't turn around and try to blackmail me.
Mr. Monk, I am at your mercy.
I'm reaching out to you.
That's okay.
I get it.
You don't have to really...reach.
I get it.
Will you help me?
So what happened?
I took the job.
Be careful.
I could use some help.
I am helping.
I just told you to be careful.
Wish we had more time.
No, no, no.
It has to be tonight.
The leper said his wife goes into town every Friday to visit her mother.
Mr. Monk, please stop calling him "the leper."
He has a name.
Believe me, he's got other things to worry about.
Car!
Car!
Get down!
Okay.
Now.
Hurry.
What are you waiting for?
Go!
- Okay, you're next.
- No.
It's, uh... it's wobbly.
Somebody has to hold it.
Mr. Monk, I can't come back.
I'm already over.
Well, it's too wobbly.
Look, it's all wobbly.
I can't climb this.
Why is it so wobbly?
- How did you do that?
- I opened the gate.
Good thinking.
Okay, hold the ladder.
No, Mr. Monk, the gate is open.
Natalie, look.
These are the leper's instructions.
I promised him I would follow them to a tee.
We nodded on it.
Well, I'm using the gate.
Okay, but don't tell the leper.
The leper was right.
She never changed the locks.
Wait!
Wait, wait, wait.
He said it's kinda tricky.
He says you have to slide it.
Here's the code.
2, 4, 6, 2.
The leper thought of everything.
They look so happy.
Here it is.
Top drawer.
In the back.
Freeze!
Don't move.
I'm calling the police.
You're supposed to be at your mother's.
My mother died five years ago.
What are those?
What are those?
Throw them here now.
Now!
Mrs. Bronson, you don't want to read those.
Who sent you?
Here's the thing.
I said who sent you?
Your husband.
Derek?
He's alive?
Is he okay?
Well...
"Okay" is a funny word.
So you've seen him?
Most of him.
Where is he?
Can you take me to him?
Mrs. Bronson, you need to trust us.
There are reasons why your husband cannot see you.
What, because of these?
These don't mean a thing.
I've known about this girl for years.
Please.
I have to see him.
That's not a good idea.
Trust us.
Or I can have you both arrested right now for breaking and entering.
Over here.
Mr. Monk?
Miss...
Miss Teeger.
Did you get the letters?
Derek.
- Mandy.
- You're alive?
I knew it.
I always knew it.
You're wrong, darling.
I died seven years ago.
Are you looking for these?
Oh, Mandy.
She didn't mean anything to me.
I know that, Derek.
I've known about this woman for years.
I forgave you a long, long time ago.
No, please.
Stay away.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Let me see you.
I just want you to come home.
I can't.
Not like this.
Go away.
Forget about me.
Darling, there are doctors, treatments.
There must be something they can do.
You don't think I've tried?
I've gone to every doctor in Europe.
No one would have to see you.
You could stay inside.
We could build you a room in the new house.
What new house?
You're... you're moving?
I have to move.
As of next week, you're legally dead.
Your sister's kids will inherit everything.
I...
I barely know them.
Darling, that money is yours.
Unfortunately, your will says otherwise.
Tell them I'm not dead.
I'm...
I'll write you a letter.
Sweetheart.
They're not going to believe me.
Or any letter.
There's a probate hearing next week.
You could come.
You could talk to them.
No, no.
It's out of the question.
Not like this.
Mr. Monk.
Is that you?
Yes, yes.
I'm afraid I have one more favor to ask.
"Wife Claims Missing "Billionaire Husband Still Alive.
"Probate hearing is set for tomorrow.
"Former homicide detective Adrian Monk is set to testify."
What the hell's Hansen's disease?
Leprosy.
He's a leper.
Oh, my God.
I thought they lived in colonies.
You know, like in Ben Hur.
And, uh, you met this guy face-to-face?
Yep, he's a client.
He called us.
He needed our help.
Mr. Monk put aside all his fear and prejudice and offered to do what he could, and I am very, very proud of him.
I shook his hand.
I can still feel it.
He's not at all contagious.
We talked to a specialist.
Randy, I think you might know him.
Dr. Polanski?
No.
Aaron Polanski?
- Can't say that I do.
- Really?
Because we thought we saw your picture hanging up in his office.
Right.
It was a case.
I was undercover, posing as a kid, a teenager with bad acne.
Captain, you remember that case?
- You're on your own, Randy.
- Still tingling.
Well, I'll tell him you said hi.
We're going out tomorrow night.
When this hearing was originally scheduled, the intention was to have Mr. Bronson officially declared deceased.
But, as you all know, some new information has surfaced, provided by his wife
Mrs. Bronson.
We have her statement, plus a handwritten letter from Mr. Bronson.
Which cannot be authenticated.
Of course it's not a perfect match.
I told you.
Derek is sick.
He could hardly write his own name.
That's rather convenient, isn't it?
It wasn't just me.
Mr. Monk saw him, too.
Your Honor, if I may.
Mr. Monk.
Is this the man you saw?
I believe it is.
According to your testimony, you only saw him in a dimly lit bar and a parking garage.
Hardly ideal conditions.
That's true.
Well, Mr. Bronson's nephews have been waiting a long time for this estate to be probated.
I'm reluctant to make a decision based on one man's testimony.
Your Honor, Adrian Monk is not just anyone.
His memory and powers of observation are legendary.
Well, there's a lot at stake here.
You say he has a great memory.
Mr. Monk.
Would you mind standing up and turning around?
Could you describe my shirt?
Which one?
Which one?
The shirt you're wearing, or the shirt your stenographer is wearing?
That's your shirt, too, isn't it?
You cut yourself shaving, and there's a tiny drop of blood on her collar.
What are you implying?
You were having a sex affair with her on that couch.
The cushions are backwards.
And one of her earrings fell off.
It's, um... it's right here.
She must have torn her blouse.
I can see it sticking out of her briefcase.
Your Honor.
I'm ready with my decision.
I will accept Mr. Monk's word that he met with Derek Bronson.
Therefore, Mrs. Bronson will retain control of the entire estate.
How long has Mr. Steiner been living here?
11 years.
And he never missed a canasta game in all that time until last night.
When was the last time you saw him?
Monday.
I saw him leaving.
And he didn't have a gig.
I could tell because he didn't take his sheet music.
He's a musician.
I know he's a musician.
He's one of my oldest tenants.
You don't think I know he's a musician?
Mrs. Kennedy, relax.
When you called the police, you asked for homicide.
Now, I don't see any evidence of a murder here.
He's dead.
I know it.
The canasta game.
Plus!
I found his cat starving this morning.
How do you explain that?
Why don't you wait downstairs, Mrs. Kennedy?
And we'll take a look around for you.
Thank you.
What are you doing?
Background music.
You know, they don't keep playing the same thing over and over.
Sure, they do.
Hard to concentrate.
Isn't it?
Hey, Randy.
Look at this.
What do you got?
Makeup kit.
Bandages.
Skin Disease.
That's interesting bedtime reading.
His appointment book.
Looking pretty busy every weekend.
Captain, look at this.
Last New Year's Eve, he played a private party for Mandy Bronson.
Boy, this must be the best first date in the history of first dates.
Maybe we should quit while we're ahead.
I'm so glad your boss needed my help.
Mm, me, too.
Whatever happened with that case?
Oh, it's over.
Bronson went back to his leper colony on Camino Island.
He says he loves it there.
Really?
Well, you know, I can believe it.
I've seen some colonies in Africa.
They're like four-star hotels.
You really are an expert.
Well, I should be.
Why is that?
Well, you remember I said I knew one person with leprosy?
- It was me.
- What was you?
I had it as a kid.
Leprosy.
Hansen's disease.
Well, don't worry.
I'm completely cured.
Yeah, actually, it's why I became a doctor.
Oh.
Yeah.
It's the best thing that ever happened to me.
Really.
Imagine that.
Okay.
What are you doing?
Making a snack.
Oh, no.
No, I promised your mother.
No junk food.
- You promised?
- Yeah.
I am the babysitter.
I don't think so.
My mom said I was babysitting you.
Okay.
Are you getting paid?
- Yeah.
- How much?
You know, that's between your mother and me.
Why?
How much are you getting?
$8 an hour.
An hour?
I guess you're the sitter.
Enjoy your fries.
"Since 1840." Who needed ketchup in 1840?
The security panel.
Pardon me?
The security panel in Bronson's house!
Bendis Security, founded 2003.
The leper said he hadn't been home in seven years.
How did he know about that alarm system?
Julie, I was duped.
It was all a con.
A "leper-con."
- What?
- Was he magically delicious?
Okay, thanks.
I'll talk to you later.
Bye!
- Natalie!
- Oh, God.
Natalie, listen.
Mom.
Hotter!
Need it hotter.
But Mom, are you okay?
I'm fine, honey.
How was the date?
Oh, it was great.
Sweetheart, I need you to do me something.
I need you to go upstairs and fill the bathtub with Listerine.
Go, go, go, go, go!
- Listen to this.
- I gotta tell you something.
- We've been duped!
- I've been duped!
Are you ready for this?
You're not gonna believe this.
He's not a leper.
He's a leper!
Oh, God.
You have the camera?
You better have the camera.
What are we looking for?
Evidence, proof, anything.
Oh, how could I not have seen it?
Derek Bronson is not a leper.
Hey, watch it.
Derek Bronson is dead.
His wife killed him seven years ago.
And she's been living off his money ever since.
I mean, she...
Watch the shoes.
She knew that when he was declared dead officially, the will would kick in, the nephews would get everything, and the party would be over.
So she found someone who resembled Derek.
And she either hired him or seduced him to suddenly "reappear."
Will you please?
That's why they chose me.
Adrian Monk, the perfect patsy.
They knew about my problems.
They knew I'd never take a good look at the guy.
So there never really was a leper.
Except for the guy you were making out with all night.
Are you drinking that?
Where's the woman who's been lecturing me all week about compassion and tolerance?
It's not funny.
You didn't have your tongue down his throat.
I shook hands with one.
That's bad enough.
Your leper wasn't even a real leper.
I thought he was real.
My leper was the real deal.
That's what counts.
You know the old saying,
There is no heart so black as the black, black heart of the phony leper?
- No, I never heard that one.
- Well, it's a saying.
Up you go.
- Up you go.
- Up you.
- Up.
- Go.
Go.
- What if she's home?
- She's not home.
We've been calling the house all morning.
- You still have the key?
- Yeah.
What is that?
- You hear that?
- Yeah.
Can I help you?
Oh, no, I'm just browsing.
Browsing for what?
Oh, did I say browsing?
No, I'm...
I'm waiting.
I'm just... just waiting for someone.
Randall.
What a nice...surprise.
Hey, Doc.
This fell off the wall.
Right.
Yeah.
Not to worry.
We'll just toss it.
- Thanks.
- That's okay.
Well, you're looking good.
Thanks.
Well, uh...
I'll, uh...see you around.
- Take care.
- Oh, hey, I, uh,
I hear you're dating a friend of mine.
Natalie Teeger.
Oh, yeah, she's amazing.
But I don't think it's gonna happen.
Well, she reacted pretty badly when I told her I used to have leprosy.
Really?
She couldn't handle it, huh?
No.
Some people.
Actually, I-I've been trying to reach her to give her a heads up.
I think Derek Bronson lied to her.
He told her he's been living on Camino Island.
But I checked this morning, and it turns out the leper colony there has been closed for two years.
Really?
I mean, maybe that guy wasn't really Bronson.
I mean, all those bandages.
Well, no, I mean, the wife met him.
It's funny, though.
We...
We're working on another case, missing persons.
We were gonna talk to Monk about it.
We found a makeup kit and a book on skin diseases.
I think I'm gonna stop by and have a chat with the wife.
Thanks, Doc.
Can I come with you?
It... it... if Natalie is in trouble, I'd just...
I'd like to be there.
- Yeah, sure.
- Oh, that's great.
Thank you.
Why don't we, uh, take separate cars?
Randy, I'm not contagious.
No, that's not what I meant.
Is that what you thought I meant?
- I mean, is that what you...
- Seemed like that.
Hello?
Can't it wait?
Hold on.
Oh, my God.
Why all the barbells?
Weights.
She's gonna dump him in the ocean.
Probably did the same thing seven years ago to her husband.
I know this guy.
He's the leper.
- He's not my leper.
- No, he's my leper.
We better call it in.
Give me your phone.
No, no.
There's no time.
Here she comes.
Come on, that way!
- No, we'll never make it!
- That way!
- That way.
- I don't think so.
No, come on.
Alright, get up!
Help me unhook them.
- Hurry!
- Throw the ropes!
Do something!
We're moving.
Hurry!
- Mr. Monk, take the ropes down.
- Faster!
- Faster!
- I'm trying.
- That's good.
- Go, go, go.
Now it's good.
Okay, okay.
Here we go.
Do something!
I'm trying.
We're too high.
Stay down!
We're too high!
Stay down, I said!
Police officer!
Put your gun down!
Wait, it's Randy.
He's with somebody.
Drop the gun!
It's my leper.
Too low, too low.
We're too low!
We're too low, we're too low.
Put the gun down now!
Now!
Down on your knees, and put your hands in front of you.
Down on your knees, and put your hands in front of you.
Now!
Now!
We're too low!
We're too low.
We're too low!
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
We're too low!
We're too low!
We're gonna crash!
Mr. Monk, where are you?
I'm down here!
Down... down here!
Take my hand.
You can do it.
Is there...
Is there anybody else... up there?
Could you look around please?
Take my hand, or you'll die!
I'm...thinking.
Please, please.
Take my hand.
Come on.
That's it.
Come on.
Come up here.
Give me your other hand.
I've got you.
Well.
What's the matter?
Hey, is the necklace too much?
Mom, you look hot.
You must really like this guy.
You're not scared?
No, why would I be scared?
Well, um, Mr. Monk, he said...
We can't all live by Mr. Monk's rules.
What kind of world would this be?
- Am I late?
- No, you're right on time.
You're perfect.
Well, these are for you.
Oh, thank you.
And...
Oh... oh, gosh.
Sorry.
Give me a little time.
Work in progress.
Yeah, well, you take all the time you want.
- Come on in.
- Okay, thank you.
Uh, is that Monk?
Adrian.
Did you get my message?
Hey, Doc.
I meant to call you.
I'm not much of a golfer, but thanks for the invite.
What are you cooking?
Maybe we should stay in tonight.
You go have fun.
You go out.
Go, go, go, go, go.
I've got a little bit of a cold.
I'd hate for you to catch it, and I just mopped the floor.
- I got a little bit of a cold.
- Cold?
And I just mopped the floor.
Yeah, okay.
I'll, uh, I'll catch you next time.
Catch you next time.
Okay.
All right.
Oh, Aaron, I want you to meet somebody.
This is Julie.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
It's nice to meet you, too.
I've heard a lot about you.
Yeah.
Well, uh, shall we get going?
- Take care.
- Bye.
Shall we?
Mr. Monk.
[Ticking Loudly]
[Ticking Continues]
Excuse me.
It's 2:00.
The doctor's just running a little late.
Okay.
No problem.
How late is he running?
Did he say?
Just a few minutes.
It won't be long.
All right.
Listen, does he...
Does he know I'm here?
Maybe I could just pop in and tell him...
Uh, I...
I don't think that's such a good idea, Mr. Monk.
No.
Where's Natalie?
She's out.
She's running some errands.
Would you like to call her?
Let's call her.
[Phone Ringing]
Hello, Mr. Monk.
Natalie, it's me.
Adrian... you know, Monk.
- Yes, Mr. Monk.
I know.
- Doctor Kroger's running late.
Then you'll have something to talk about, won't you?
Do you need me to come over?
I'm five minutes away.
Where are you?
You know, I don't even know.
I'm at some coffee shop.
Did you find that toothbrush?
Yes, sir.
Had to go to about five drugstores, but I found it.
The Gertler 4000...
[Whispering] With the extra-soft polyurethane bristles?
Yes, and the blue rubber handle.
Yes, sir.
Thank God.
What about Trudy's picture?
I just came from the frame shop.
I got that too.
How does it look?
- You know, they did a really good job.
You can't even see that scratch.
- Excellent.
She really was pretty.
- Yes, she was.
- Are you sure you're okay?
Maybe I should just come over.
No.
No, no.
You know what?
I'm okay.
In fact, I'm gonna be fine.
Okay.
Well, have a good session.
And I'll be there when you get out.
Thank you.
[Bell On DoorJingling]
Trudy?
Tru-Trudy.
[No Audible Dialogue]
Hi.
How are you, Zach?
Nice to see you.
Sorry I'm a little late.
# [Up-tempo Folk]

# But I don't think so
# 'Cause it's a jungle out there
# It's a jungle out there
Adrian, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
Maggie said that you were getting a little anxious out there?
That's true.
I'm pretty excited.
Hmm.
I have some news.
Really?
As you know, yesterday was Trudy's birthday.
I went to the grave.
Then I came home, and I reread some of her poems.
There was this one passage that really got to me.
[Stammering] L-I just kept rereading it.
It goes, "The snows that burn away...
"like tears of God reveal the world anew.
"We are reborn.
Nothing is lost forever."
It's beautiful.
Yeah.
Nothing is lost forever.
[Sighs] It was as if...
she was speaking to me.
Mm-hmm.
Like she was saying,
I'm here without her... for a reason.
I think...
I think she wants me to let go.
Wow.
I know.
Yeah.
[Chuckles] Wow.
And then yesterday, the radio was playing a song,
but it wasn't the radio.
It wasn't the radio?
# There are chicks
#Just right for some kissin'
# And I mean
# To kiss me a few
You know what it was?
It was me.
You.
It was me.
I was singing.
Right. [Chuckles]
I think I'm happy.
[Sighs]
Is that possible?
Why not?
It's so long overdue.
[Chuckles] Happy!
Yes.
I'm happy.
Yes, yes.
And then this morning,
I looked up...
There was a picture on the wall.
It was a little crooked.
I just kept eating.
I didn't get up and fix it.
L-I know.
Because the glass here on the table?
You still haven't put it back on the coaster.
What do you think?
What do you think?
Every time I say "What do you think?" You say "What do you think?"
Well, what do you think?
[Chuckling] I'm almost afraid to say it.
I think I might be getting better.
Adrian, reading the poem... the reaction you had to it...
it-it's what we call a threshold event.
It's a big first step.
First steps are the hardest.
You okay?
Yeah, yeah.
It's just been, like, such a long time that I've been waiting.
Just so...
Oh, thank you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm crying.
I'm sorry.
Does it make you uncomfortable?
Yes, it does.
Hmm.
But what doesn't?
Did you tell anybody about me?
Where's our waitress?
She just disappeared.
Zach...
Mr. Ellinghouse, this is very important.
Did you tell anybody else about me?
Who would I tell?
Janice is gone.
She's all I had.
I don't like this cloak-and-dagger stuff, Trudy.
Well, believe me.
It's for your own good.
And... remember I asked you not to call me Trudy.
Call me Lisa.
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry.
Lisa.
I still don't understand why you had to fake your own death.
I was protecting my family.
I was writing an article about an extremist group in the Bay Area, and they were looking for me.
They would have killed me and my husband for sure if they'd found me.
The only way to stop 'em was to pretend I was dead.
Oh.
Here we go.
Tuna fish sandwich, and a coffee and one cinnamon stick.
Cinnamon stick?
Yeah, to sweeten it.
It's a little trick I picked up in Madrid.
Oh, that's right.
You and Janice went to Madrid.
I have all the letters she wrote.
I kept everything.
I know you did.
That's why I'm here, Zach.
Hey, great sandwich.
They got little pieces of celery in this.
Do you want some?
No.
I can't.
I'm allergic to fish.
Oh, that's right.
I remember.
I remember everything... eventually.
We need to talk, Zach, about the key... the key thatJanice left you.
Do you have it?
Oh, I still can't believe she's gone.
Yeah, I know.
I know it hurts.
I miss her too.
This is...
This is very important.
Do you have the key?
Look, I looked for it.
I couldn't find it.
I'll look for it tonight.
I prom...
I'll find it.
I promise.
Okay.
I'll meet you on Keep Street, in front of the library tomorrow.
Do you know where that is?
Yeah.
10:00.
10:00.
Zach, don't let me down.
It's my key.
Janice wanted me to have it.
[Monk] # There is wine all ready for tastin' A little mayonnaise.
# And Cadillacs so shiny and new Some lemon juice.
A little salt... just a pinch.
Just a sprinkle.
# Da, da, da
Oh, Kevin, I really appreciate this.
Oh, stop.
This is what neighbors are for.
[Chuckles]
Is that enough?
How many people are coming?
I... don't know.
Well, the captain has this barbecue every year but, uh,
I've never felt like going before.
Oh, so this is like your coming out party.
Like my coming...
Natalie, are you okay?
Yeah.
I'm just tired.
Yeah.
Okay, for the record, this one is a little uneven, but I don't care.
I'm gonna use it anyway.
Okay.
The old me would have obsessed with making it...
So hold on.
All right.
Okay.
But now I'm gonna let it go.
Lettin' it go.
I'm lettin' it go.
It's gone.
It's done.
All right.
Just one second.
One more.
Done.
Done.
Done.
Mr. Monk?
Yeah.
I spoke with Julie's doctor today, and he said she might be allergic to fish.
Oh?
Oh.
Poor kid.
Yeah.
Do you know anybody else who's allergic to fish?
I think the man who lives across the street from my sister... is allergic to fish.
Not right across the street.
Actually, you know what?
It's not even really a street.
It's more of a cul-de-sac.
That's great, Kevin.
How about you, Mr. Monk?
No.
Well, Trudy was.
Oh, I didn't tell you the best part.
Here's the best part.
Hmm.
Dr. Kroger is gonna call the department and recommend me for reinstatement.
That's...
That is...
Great.
Congratulations.
Hey, I know.
Later, let's get my old uniform down and see if it fits.
I'll tell you something.
It's not gonna fit if you eat too much of this.
[Both Laughing]
It's never gonna fit.
Hey, I met somebody who said he knew you.
Zach Ellinghouse?
Ellinghouse?
Right.
Oh, Trudy used to work with his daughter.
How's he doing?
He's fine.
Good.
Mr. Monk?
Yeah.
There's something I have to tell you.
Okay.
It's good potato salad.
What do you mean you don't have it?
I thought we had a deal.
Trudy, don't get mad.
I'm just talking about some compensation.
[Sighs]
I don't know where that key goes.
Maybe it's to something really valuable.
No, no.
It's not valuable, Zach.
I told you.
It's...
It's just some research that Janice and I did together, okay?
It's just some old papers.
- [Shutter Clicks] - [Ellinghouse] You're really anxious about it, and...
[Clears Throat] L...
I have expenses, you know?
I mean, bills.
- [Shutter Clicks]
- Janice isn't here to help me.
Who's gonna help me?
Okay, you want some money.
- So, tell me how much.
Give me a number.
- A thousand dollars.
It's not that much.
Fine.
I'll have it today.
I'll be at your house at 3:00.
And, Zach,
I am not leaving without that key.
[Gasps] What are you doing?
Who are you?
Natalie Teeger.
I work for your...
I work for Adrian.
I need that camera.
Just please tell me what's going on.
Have you told Adrian about me?
Don't.
You can't.
If you care about him at all, you can't tell him.
We both know this would kill him.
I'm dead.
I have to stay that way.
Understand?
[Rock]
[Chattering] [Man] Sweetheart, let your sister have a turn.
[Stottlemeyer] Whoops.
[Growls]
Okay.
How about that one?
That one?
Yeah.
That one.
[Continues]
Now what was wrong with that one?
Oh, that was lopsided.
Here, you do the buns.
Switch.
Hey, guys.
Well-done, please.
Well-done.
Bun.
Need a bun.
The bun.
Thanks.
Okay, that...
That's a little off center.
I could...
I could reposition that for you.
Or you know what?
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna l...
I'm gonna let it go.
You enjoy it.
Life is too short.
[Chuckles] We're...
Let's let it go.
Okay.
Thanks.
You know, the commissioner asked me... what I thought about bringing you back on a contingency basis.
I told him I thought we should try it.
[Whispering] Captain...
No.
Don't say anything.
Okay.
We'll take it one day at a time, okay?
Excuse me.
[Sighs]
Oh, listen.
There's a...
There's a few things that I should say that I don't.
I mean, I've been working on a few things myself.
Well, you're not perfect, God knows, but... you're still probably the best cop I've ever met.
And working with you has been one of the great honors of my life.
You're the man.
And I mean that.
Right back at ya, sir.
I love you, man.
Yeah, I love you too.
Oh, yeah.
He said I was the man.
He was getting all teary.
Really?
Wow.
[Disher] Not that it's competition or anything, it's just nice to be number one.
Excuse me.
Hey, Paulie?
It's a red alert.
Tell Karen that we're almost out of beer.
Captain, do you have a minute?
Sure.
Uh, gosh, I know this sounds weird, but... were you there when Trudy died?
Who?
Trudy Monk?
No, no.
I got there an hour later.
Why?
So, you didn't actually see the body?
What are you getting at?
I met her...
this morning.
I talked to her.
Finally.
Here's your money.
You can count it if you want.
[Clears Throat] I've changed my mind.
What are you talking about?
We had a deal.
MyJanice gave me this key.
She didn't leave it for you.
Why do you think she did that?
Well, she couldn't leave it to me, could she?
Huh?
She thought I was dead.
I've decided to leave all her papers and her notebooks to the university.
Zach...
Zach...
Janice and I worked on that story together.
Those papers belong to both of us.
[Sighs] L-I don't know.
I have to think.
This isn't a game!
Give me the key!
Trudy, what are you doing?
Give me the key.
Stop it!
Trudy!
Just give it to me!
- [Groaning]
- Zach?
[Stottlemeyer] It's not possible.
It's impossible.
She said she faked her own death to protect him.
She talked to a paramedic before she died.
Okay, but maybe he was lying.
Or-Or maybe he was in on it.
Captain, I've been following her.
She's been meeting a man, this older guy named Zach Ellinghouse.
Do you know him?
Ellinghouse?
No.
Yeah, they've been arguing about a key.
He has some key that belongs to her.
How many of those have you had?
Captain, I saw Trudy Monk.
Did you take her picture?
Yeah, but she took the film.
[Disher] Captain!
Yeah, okay.
We just caught one in Mission Hill.
- Now?
- Neighbor heard a fight.
Door was open.
She went in, found a body.
Karen's gonna kill me.
But, all right, uh, grab Philby and Dietrich.
All right, uh, 418 Vinton, Apartment 3-D.
- Victim's name was Ellinghouse.
- Ellinghouse?
Yeah, Zachary Ellinghouse.
Why?
You know him?
Hey, what's going on?
Nothing.
We're rolling.
There's a fresh one in Mission Hill.
All right, let's go.
I'm in.
No.
Hey, hey, hey, Monk.
Look, we don't need you on this one.
I want you to stay here.
Look, uh, clean the grill.
The grill is really greasy.
Yeah.
What?
Yeah, yeah, come on.
It'll be fun.
What are you talking about?
I'm getting my badge back.
I'm back on the team, right?
Come on, uh, let's go.
I'm in.
Let's lock and load.
[Coughing] Oh, it's really dusty in here.
Mr.
-Mr.
Monk, maybe you should wait in the car.
No, no, no.
I'm fine.
You know, Monk, we can't pay you for this.
Oh, it's on the house.
Least I could do.
Yeah, here we go.
Body was here?
Yeah.
Looks like he was on the desk, face down.
Uh, he fell onto this thing, rolled over onto the floor.
What do you call that thing?
Spindle.
Spindle.
God, that's it.
Finish my report.
The rug was like this.
Yeah.
Looks like he tripped.
Wasn't premeditated.
Oh, there was a struggle...
with a woman.
A woman?
How do you know that?
Heel marks in the carpet.
Oh, she had very small feet.
A lot of women have small feet.
She wore perfume.
Shalimar.
Trudy wore Shalimar.
Wait.
No reading glasses.
I think he kept something stashed in this book.
- A key.
Did they find a key?
- No.
No, nothing.
Maybe they were fighting over that.
[Disher] Look at this.
It's her mug...
lipstick.
Oh, yes.
[Sniffing]
Cinnamon...
to sweeten the coffee.
Trudy used to do that.
Is this the victim?
Yeah.
His name's Zach...
Zach Ellinghouse.
Oh, no!
I knew him.
Ellinghouse, Natalie.
You were just asking me about him.
Captain, his daughter, Janice, used to work with my...
Trudy.
It's weird you keep mentioning Trudy.
There was a witness who heard a struggle.
L-Lieutenant, let me...
let me...
What's this?
"Witness distinctly heard victim say,
"What are you doing, Trudy?"'
[Whispers] Trudy.
That was Trudy's name.
Mr. Monk, there's something I need to tell you.
Yeah.
Lf...
Mitch were... somehow still alive, I'd want somebody to tell me.
Tell you what?
What?
What are you talking about?
It's Trudy.
She's not...
She's not dead, Mr. Monk.
Trudy?
I've been following her.
I talked to her.
[Scoffs]
Well, this is...
I mean, that...
This is just...
Monk.
Hey, Monk.
Monk, I don't believe it either, okay?
But we don't know what's going on.
Captain...
Look, M-Maybe if we just got...
if we got a sample of her D.N.A.
No.
No!
No, that way we'd know where we stand.
Trudy's D.N.A.?
What are you saying?
Maybe we could just exhume the body.
Look, we're miles away from exhuming anything.
She said she faked her own death to protect you.
She's alive, Mr. Monk.
[Gasping]
Trudy.
Trudy!
[Tires Screeching]
Trudy.
Monk, was it her?
He's not sure.
She was too far away.
Did you make the car?
S-Sedan.
Gray sedan.
What kind of sedan?
Did you see the driver?
The license number?
He doesn't remember.
[Sighs]
Is there anything I can do?
Is there anything...
I can do?
[Sighs] Okay.
Excellent.
[Disher] Good.
How's he doing?
How do you think he's doing?
I have never felt more helpless in my life.
Well, I just spoke to Hank Merchant at the D.A.'s office.
Wait.
Did I authorize that?
No, sir.
I figured you wouldn't mind.
I'm the man, remember?
[Sighs]
I laid everything out for him, and he thinks we have enough to exhume the body.
You just have to say the word.
Look, hey, no, no.
We're not digging anything up without Monk's okay.
Look...
Let's just give him a day or two, okay?
Captain.
Doctor, thank God you're here.
Oh, Natalie called my service.
What's going on?
[Stottlemeyer] There is some evidence to suggest... that Monk's wife, Trudy, may still be alive.
Excuse me?
We think she faked her own death and has been hiding out ever since.
And we're pretty sure she killed a guy earlier today.
Trudy's our primary suspect.
All right.
All right.
So he's having a psychotic break.
He's delusional.
No.
He's not delusional.
We have two eyewitnesses... and some physical evidence.
This...
Th-Th-This is big.
Excuse me.
Dr. Kroger.
Mr. Monk, look who's here.
It's Dr. Kroger.
Natalie, give us a minute, please.
Adrian, um...
Here.
You have to drink something.
Did you drink something?
You got it?
You got it?
Okay.
Adrian.
Okay.
[Whispers] Good.
Adrian,
I'm not going to believe anything until I hear it from you.
Is Trudy alive?
I don't know.
But if it's true, then nothing is true.
If this is true, nothing is true.
Why didn't she contact me?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Maybe she's in trouble.
She's in trouble.
A-Adrian, where are you going?
[Kroger] Adrian?
Hey, Monk?
Monk, where are you going?
I have to find her.
We'll go with you.
No.
I have to do this alone.
This is between me and my wife.
[Sobs]
She's not you.
It's not you.
[Exhales]
Hi.
How you doing?
Hi.
My wife is buried back there.
[Sighs] She's still dead.
[Exhales]
She's right where I left her.
Okay.
And I am so... relieved.
I mean, I love her with all my heart, but...
[Sighs]
Who's this?
This is my husband.
Ah.
I'm sure he's dead too.
And he'll stay dead.
Don't worry about that.
This is an excellent cemetery.
They know what they're doing.
Everybody here...
probably dead.
Nice talking to you.
[Phone Ringing]
That's it, there.
Trudy's desk?
For five years.
She loved this job.
I did that.
I was leaning in to kiss her, spilled some coffee.
[Chuckles]
I bet it was the last time you spilled anything in your life.
Oh, I spilled something seven years later...
January 12, 1999.
January 12?
You mean during the earthquake?
Earthquakes count.
I don't make the rules.
Mr. Monk, could I ask you something?
What happened yesterday in the cemetery?
How do you know the woman we've been seeing isn't Trudy?
We still have one or two copies in the archives.
You can keep that one.
I don't understand.
Why would anybody want to impersonate Trudy?
I don't know.
I wish some of these kids would impersonate her a little bit.
She was the best reporter I ever knew.
Here it is..."Peer Pressure" byJanice Ellinghouse and Trudy Monk.
It was the only article they ever wrote together.
It's a hell of a piece.
It should have won a Pulitzer.
Yeah.
- It was on the dockworkers' union?
- Ed Lindley, the union president, was indicted because of that.
He's still in jail.
That's right.
The guy was untouchable.
But Trudy and Janice never stopped digging.
That article made history.
Lindley's second-in-command, Jack Bollinger, became the union president because of this.
He's still there.
Seems to be running a pretty clean shop.
Whoa, they are really naming names here.
Look at all these payoffs.
How did they get all this?
Hard work and a secret informant.
Deep background.
Trudy never told me who it was.
Well, they never told me either.
Where was Janice's desk?
Over there.
Still haven't cleaned it out yet.
It's, uh, hard to say good-bye.
Yes, it is.
- "Pay rent."
- Yeah, so?
She was already paying a mortgage.
What could she be renting?
What...
What...
What can you rent for a hundred and five dollars?
I rent a storage locker.
It costs about that much per month.
The missing key...
the one from the book.
It could have opened a locker.
Mr. Monk, there are hundreds of storage lockers in San Francisco.
Where would we even start?
Well, Natalie, how about Trans-Cal Moving and Storage, 13025 Third Street?
What?
Th-This storage place...
what time does it open?
[Trudy] 8:00.
I'm gonna need you to come along with me.
Why?
You said once I got you the key, I could leave.
Change of plans.
I don't know what kind of security they're gonna have.
If we're stopped, I'm gonna need you to pretend to beJanice.
Oh, and bring that along.
She was a blonde too.
I hate this thing.
Why?
It looks pretty good on you.
Then, you looked pretty good as the redhead in that show.
What was it called again?
A man is dead.
Yeah, I know that.
And I am sorry.
It was a terrible accident.
And that other guy...
Trudy's husband.
I will never forget his face.
I mean, he was really hurting.
Look, things happen.
We're moving on.
This is all about self-preservation now.
Do you understand?
If whatever is in that storage locker ever gets out, I am a dead man.
I can't do this.
Yes, you can.
Look-Look.
You're an actress, aren't you?
Well, our little show is not over yet.
[Chattering]
[Stottlemeyer] Good morning.
What's going on?
Organizing a task force.
Out of my office?
Yes, sir.
Well, I figured you wouldn't mind.
I'm the man, right?
Yeah, that's right.
You're the man.
Don't worry, sir.
I am all over this one.
I've reassigned Rudner and Sergeant Hyden.
They're already on their way in.
The report from the lab.
There were no identifiable prints in the apartment.
Trudy must have wiped everything down before she left.
I'm running off 5,000 of those...
"Wanted for Questioning."
I put a photo of her up on the hot board, and I've been trying to contact her parents.
W-Wait, are you...
Wait.
You've been trying to contact whose parents?
Trudy's.
In case she tries to call them.
No, Randy.
Wait, wait, wait...
And I'm, uh, releasing that to the press.
It's a press release.
Oh, uh, I called the deputy commissioner too.
Just want...
Lieutenant!
Excuse me, gentlemen.
[Groans]
Randall, when I said that about... about you being the man,
I thought I was talking to Monk.
Oh.
Okay.
Well, that explains it.
Randy, it doesn't mean that I don't appreciate...
No, l-I understand.
No problem.
Why don't I just get you a cup of coffee?
Won't be needing that.
[Sighs]
It's number 12.
Number 12.
How do you know?
I saw the list.
The security guard just showed you the list?
Not exactly.
I caught a glimpse of it as he was bending over.
Why was he bending over?
To help me look for my earring.
[Gasps] I lost my earring.
Oh, my God.
It's irreplaceable.
It was a gift from my Aunt Lisa on her deathbed.
I think it might have fallen over there.
Maybe she's already been here.
No.
There's water in the handle from the rain last night.
It would have spilled out if she lifted the door.
Listen.
Listen.
[Monk] That's the car I saw.
It's gotta be her.
Come on.
It's her.
It's her.
Mr. Monk, they're gonna see you.
What are you doing?
Get down.
I had her back.
[Sighs] For an hour and a half,
I thought she might be alive.
Psst.
[Exhales] I had hope.
Isn't hope the worst?
No, Mr. Monk.
Hope is a good thing.
You're very young.
I know this guy.
I've seen him before.
Do you have the article that Trudy and Janice wrote?
Yeah.
[Natalie] Yeah.
That's him.
Jack Bollinger.
- The union boss.
- He was their anonymous source 10 years ago.
Now that they're both gone, he must be panicked... that all of their research material will be made public.
And his old friends will know that he ratted them out.
What about the woman?
Bollinger must have just found her.
It was a con game to trickJanice's father into giving up that key.
I don't get it.
How did she know so much about Trudy?
Bollinger must have coached her.
He spent time with Trudy when they were writing this, so he knew a lot about her.
I'm calling the captain.
[Stottlemeyer] Lieutenant, we're rolling.
That was Natalie.
Monk broke the case.
They're at a storage locker right up the street.
Randy.
Randy!
Let's go.
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Were you talking to me?
[Sighs] It's just hard to tell sometimes.
Randy, you know how fragile Monk is.
I have to stroke him all the time.
But you're tougher than that.
Come on.
You're the man.
Let's go.
Oh, so everybody's the man.
No.
Just you and Monk.
You're my two men.
Let's go.
If we were both drowning, who would you save?
I don't know...
both of you.
No, if you could only save one of us.
I'd probably save Monk because he can't swim, and I know you're an excellent swimmer.
Suppose I was holding an anchor?
You're holding an anchor?
Uh-huh.
Who would you save then?
Well, why don't you let go of the anchor?
It's a family heirloom.
I'm leaving.
Mr. Bollinger, can I go now?
Go start the car.
No, no.
Mr. Monk, it's not Trudy.
Let's just wait for the captain.
Just...
Stay here.
What the hell are you doing?
I found some notebooks and some tapes, but they're not all labeled, and...
I can't afford to miss anything.
So we... are going to Plan B. Oh, Mr...
- Mr. Bollinger, you can't do that!
I don't want anyone else getting hurt.
- Start the damn car!
Trudy?
- What the hell is he doing here?
- I'm her husband.
Son of a bitch, it never ends.
H
- How did he find us?
Who else knows we're here?
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Your hair... hair was more like...
like...
[Stammering] Look, l-I didn't know, okay?
L-I thought this was just a job.
First row, number 12!
[Tires Screeching]
You, freak show, get away from her.
No, Mr. Bollinger, don't.
Trudy, listen.
Okay, that is enough!
No, no, no!
Don't!
Don't!
They're gonna find a body in the ashes here!
I have no choice!
He knows too much!
- Oh, God.
- [Stottlemeyer] Hey!
[Yelps]
[Groaning]
[Panting]
Oh, I'm so sorry.
You loved her.
I'll tell her.
[Natalie] Well, I think it stinks.
What stinks?
The department deciding not to reinstate you.
They didn't even give you a chance.
You can't really blame them.
After what happened, I'm kind of back to...
What?
Normal?
Well, to... to kind of normal.
Uh...
What?
Wait a second.
Uh, I touched that one twice.
I have to...
You know, Mr. Monk, you never told me.
What happened in the cemetery?
How did you know that that woman wasn't really Trudy?
Well, I went to the grave, and it still hurt.
So I knew.
Yeah, I know that hurt.
It's never wrong.
Nope.
It isn't.
Neither are you.
[Chuckles]
Okay, here's the drop-off order for tonight :
Penny, movie ;
Paige, mall ;
Parker, Patton, party ;
Pearce... wait
Where are you going tonight?
Life isn't about destinations.
It's a journey, an open road full of opportunities and surprises.
- What does that mean?
- I have no plans.
Listen,drop me off a few blocks from the party so Lauren doesn't see me show up in this gas guzzler.
Lauren, the environmentalist babe?
If she's into recycling, she can use me over and over again.
Mom, my friends are waiting for me.
Can you please drop me off first?
- Fine.
- What?
No way.
That's not fair.
- Quiet!
- What?
Or nobody's going anywhere.
Bob, why'd you stop?
It was just an idle threat.
Carol, check the side view mirror.
- See that thing on fire?
- Yeah.
What is that?
Our transmission.
What's so funny?
Nothing.
I just don't want to cry in front of the kids.
- Hi, mama.
What you doing?
- Looking for a new van.
That's a little cold, isn't it?
I mean, it's only been a day, and you're already replacing q-mobi?
Q-mobi?
The quint-mobile.
God, you don't even know its name.
Pearce, honey, I'm sorry, but we need a car.
Oh, okay, well, maybe you can use it to drive to oz and get a heart.
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, honey.
Listen, I found a minivan in our price range.
It's a '91 with only 280,000 miles on it.
Bob, I've been wanting a '91 since '97.
Well, honey, you can put away the classifieds, because I am getting us a brand-new minivan.
Check this out.
Remember how we got the old minivan for free for doing that commercial with the quints when they were babies?
Well, I was thinking at work today, why don't we do another commercial and get another new car?
So, I called the car company and pitched them the idea of a sequel, and they loved it.
- Bob, that's fantastic.
- Yeah.
Now, here, check this thing out.
Four-wheel drive, dual climate control, map lights, makeup lights, reading lights, and all leather interior.
and yet porno does nothing for you.
A car commercial?
This is awesome!
Once it airs, every lady in town's going to want to take the turbo Patton for a little test drive.
I hear it goes from zero to 60 in one second.
Oh, my god, a commercial?
Listen, I've never told anyone this, and I know it's going to come as a shock to you all, but I think I might want to be a model.
Oh, man!
There's going to be one less brain surgeon in the world.
Now, the commercial's not a done deal, but it's looking pretty good.
I called the car people, and they want to see us tomorrow for a little meet-and-greet.
- Wow, that's pretty exciting, Bob.
- Thank you.
- Who are you?
- Tyler, Paige's boyfriend.
Since when?
For over a month.
I've had dinner here, like, ten times.
I think the whole idea blows.
Do you remember why we stopped doing commercials in the first place?
Yeah.
The Helbergs.
They came along with their perfect little blond quints and stole all our business.
They thought they were so much better than us 'cause they were natural, not cooked in a lab like you guys.
Well, that didn't stop you from trying to peddle us wherever you could, like the time you had us dress as the five stages of grief for that psychology convention.
Hey, we got a lot of free therapy for Pearce out of that.
That was a therapist?
I thought he was just a friend with very limited time.
Look, we need a car, and this is the only way we can afford to get a new one, so we're all doing the commercial.
- Sorry, but I'm not doing it.
- Yes, you are.
I mean, every lady who sees this commercial's going to want one of me.
Oh, Patton, it's an ad for a minivan, not a mini-man.
Hey, guys, guys, guys, I think I know what this is about, okay?
I miss q-mobi, too.
But she wouldn't want us to be sad.
She'd want us to be brave and... damn it!
Look, look, I'm sorry, but I'm dating an environmentalist, and I'm not going to go on tv and promote an oil-burning, ozone-depleting smog machine that could ultimately destroy my chances of scoring with her.
Fine.
We'll do the commercial without you.
Yeah, damn straight, we will!
You know, there's something you kids got to know.
You're all replaceable.
Just watch.
You.
You're Parker now.
Bam!
So no need to be nervous.
We're just going to go in there and shake hands and smile.
Do you want us to dance around and throw our own feces, too?
Only if they ask us.
Pearce, what are you wearing?
It's a seat belt from q-mobi.
- It's like she's still hugging me.
- Well, you look psychotic.
Well, you-you didn't say anything on the car ride over.
Yeah, because I thought you were wearing a seat belt.
I am.
I should've recast more of 'em when I had the chance.
Oh!
You must be the Chase quints.
Hmm.
I thought you'd look more alike.
Oh, well, they can.
Ha, see?
And look at this one.
Aren't you adorable?
Yes, I am.
You likey?
That's Patton.
He'll be sedated for the shoot.
- I'm Parker.
- Yes, you are.
Anyway, we are really excited about the ad, so just give me a couple of minutes, and we'll schedule your audition.
Uh, what audition?
Oh, it's going to be between you and another family we did a commercial with 15 years ago.
- What family?
- The Helbergs.
- Hello, Bob.
- Francis.
I haven't seen you around the audition circuit lately.
- Decided to take a little break.
- Oh, it's just as well.
We were kicking your ass anyway.
Hey, see this watch?
You know what it cost me?
Nothing!
Kids did a Rolex ad.
Show 'em, kids.
- Uh, you remember my wife, Carol.
- Carol.
I sure do.
Figured you would've dumped this guy by now.
Kidding.
So, Francis, where's your wife?
Uh, she, uh... she left me.
- Oh, well, that is too bad.
-Yeah.
For a two-week vacation in Italy!
You wouldn't believe what it's costing me.
Nothing!
Kids did an airline ad.
Free travel around the globe.
Okay, mr.
Chase.
Why don't you all come inside?
Not to complain, but why should we have to audition?
I mean, this commercial was my idea.
Oh, what's the matter, Chase, afraid of a little competition?
What, against you guys?
Come on.
Look at my kids, and then look at yours.
- I'm Parker.
- I miss q-mobi.
I can't see.
- I love your hair.
- I love your hair.
It's like looking in a mirror.
This is one commercial that the Helbergs are not going to take from us.
We're going to rehearse till we're perfect, and we're going to get that car.
And not for us, but for your father.
This man has given up all his dreams for you kids.
I mean, look at him.
He has no car, no friends, a dead-end job.
This man needs a win.
Okay, everyone in the car.
Whoa.
Shouldn't I sit in the front seat so all the lady viewers can dream about getting me in the back seat?
Keep it up, thumbelina, you'll be sitting in the glove compartment.
- Now, where's Penny?
- Where isn't Penny?
What does that mean?
How should I know?
I don't even know who Penny is.
What's going on?
We have to audition for the commercial now, and we're up against the Helbergs.
The Helbergs.
I hate them.
You know, especially Bucky.
That little weasel super-glued me to my big wheel right before an audition.
I want back in.
What about your environmentalist babe?
Oh, forget about Lauren and her crystal deodorant, which works not at all, by the way.
Anyway, thanks for filling in, Tyler, but I will take it from here.
No, it's-it's too late.
We can't switch you out now.
Why not?
They're not going to notice.
Are you kidding?
This guy said, "I'm Parker" 15 times in a ten-minute meeting.
I mean, like it or not, he made an impression.
Okay, let's just rehearse, please.
Pearce, what's the matter?
It's just that everything in this car reminds me of q-mobi.
Chairs, pillows... fireplace.
Damn it!
You okay?
Look, I know how upsetting it can be when a car only lasts 15 years.
But you got to get past it.
It's just a car.
Just a car, dad?
The first time I ever saw snow was through the windows of this car.
The first time I heard mom laugh was in this car.
I told my first knock-knock joke in this car.
Do you remember it?
Knock-knock.
- Who's there?
- Orange.
- Orange who?
- Orange juice.
That still kills me.
Look, Pearce... what you need is some closure, so why don't we just take a minute and say good-bye?
- Can I sing?
- No.
Bye, q-mobi.
Well, that's just very weird.
Penny!
Oh, my god!
First time I saw Penny making out with a Helberg was in this car.
Chad Helberg.
Pearce, I want to talk to your sister for a second.
Could you go inside, please?
- Francis.
- Hey, Carol.
So, this is casa de Chase.
You know, I got a boat that sleeps more than this.
- Know what I paid for it?
- Nothing?
What planet are you from?
It's a freaking boat, lady.
- Francis, what are you doing here?
- Oh, look, look the family's rehearsing.
So, what are you, the hood ornament?
No, that would be you, baldilocks.
He's funny.
You're funny.
You know, aside from my kids, I represent some other acts.
- You juggle?
- No.
You mind being juggled?
- Listen, Francis...
- I'm just looking around, Carol.
Hey, we haven't met.
Who are you?
- Oh, uh, I'm...
- Uh, that is Paige's boyfriend...
Tyler.
So, how long have you two been dating?
H- uh?
Oh, uh, about a month.
- But I haven't slept with him.
It must be pretty serious, 'cause, uh, you're in the family portrait already.
Yes, it is.
It is very, very serious.
They're inseparable.
Hey, wait a second.
Why isn't he in the picture?
Uh... he painted it.
He's my little Picasso.
Uh, it's Parker.
A Helberg?
How could you?
Do you really hate me that much?
Yeah, everything's about you, dad.
Did it ever occur to you that I might really like him?
Oh, please.
What could you two possibly have in common?
Uh, gee, I don't know.
We both like sushi and no doubt, and we're both quintuplets.
Mr. Chase, I know your family's poor and all, but I really like Penny.
She changed my whole outlook on life.
What, you've known her, like, six hours.
Yeah, but really well for the last two.
All right, that is it.
You're not seeing him anymore.
- Or what?
- Or you are no longer my daughter.
Fine.
Good luck getting that commercial with four quintuplets.
Hey, where you going?
Come on, it was just an idle threat.
First time I was naked in a minivan was in this car.
- He's in this picture, too.
- Francis, why are you here?
'Cause I think my kid Chad's here somewhere.
What are you talking about?
There's my boy.
Why is he here?
And why are they holding hands?
Why is he here?
And why are they holding hands?
Bob, don't be such a prude.
You know it's okay for Paige and her boyfriend, Tyler, to hold hands.
Of course it is.
It's perfectly natural.
So, Chase, looks like our two kids hooked up, huh?
Yeah, Francis.
You're taking it better than I did.
Aw, Chad, let's go.
Hey, thanks for understanding, dad.
What, are you trying to dilute the Helberg gene pool?
Go!
You know what you're getting for dinner tonight?
Nothing!
Penny, I cannot believe you're dating a Helberg.
Parker and Paige are hooking up, and you're giving me a hard time?
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't stay away.
A Chase doesn't run from a Helberg.
All right, but you're here as Paige's boyfriend.
Don't mess this up for me.
Oh, I don't plan on messing it up... for you.
- That's a little ominous.
- Is it?
Well, now it's just creepy.
Okay, mr.
Chase, we're ready.
Okay, Chases, you'll audition first, and then the Helbergs.
Uh, no way; we go second.
That is non-negotiable.
- Okay, great; we'll go first.
- Ha, no way.
You can't just change the order.
This woman's got a schedule.
Some people.
I want this car, Bob.
I've smelled it.
I've tasted it.
I can't go back to pre-owned.
- "Tasted it"?
- I licked the upholstery.
Happy?
Look at her.
Flaunting that Helberg in my face.
What does she see in him?
It couldn't possibly be those six-pack abs and that rock-hard butt.
I bumped, I bumped into him.
- Hey, Pearce, want to have some fun?
- Yeah!
Let's wrestle.
- You be the 'gator.
- What?
- Pearce, get off me!
- Hey, quiet!
'Gators don't talk.
What?
No, no, Pearce, no.
Just watch when Bucky Helberg tries to get up from that chair.
Okay, Chases, let's get in the car.
We're going to tape this so we have something to send to the higher-ups.
Paige, listen.
I think we should break up.
What?
!
I like you; it's just... for some reason, I think of you more as a sister.
- You're breaking up with me?
- Now?
You're doing this now?
Well, yeah.
I wanted to wait till the audition was over.
- It hasn't started yet.
- Then why are we driving home?
- You are the stupidest person that I have ever...
- and, action!
- Hi.
I'm Bob Chase.
- And I'm Carol Chase.
These are our quintuplets.
You're a jerk.
Do I kiss like a sister?
15 years ago, my wife and I... whoa!
- I've never seen so many buttons.
- My god, you people are idiots.
...and cut!
Cut!
Thank you, Chases.
- Can we try that again?
- No.
Ah, that's got to hurt, Chase.
Hey, you know what'll make you feel better after an audition like that?
Nothing!
Okay Helbergs, let's show 'em how it's done.
- Bucky, lose the chair.
- I can't, dad.
I'm stuck to it.
I said lose it now.
God, they're monsters.
Well, good luck, Chad.
Not that you'll need it.
Thanks, Penny.
See you after.
Why are you talking like that?
Penny suggested I get my tongue pierced, and it's still slightly swollen.
What?
You know you cannot change your appearance in any way, shape, or form.
It is clearly stated in the contract you kids signed with me.
- We were six!
- Okay, we'll work around it.
Just keep your mouth closed.
Get in the van.
No!
I'm tired of being your little slave.
Penny told me that I'm a person, a human being.
And I'm not going to do any more commercials.
- I'm thick of thelling things.
- Okay.
Okay, fine.
Leave.
But you better get a good lawyer, 'cause I'm taking you down.
Okay, Jill, we're ready.
Uh, mr.
Helberg, we really can't do a quint commercial with only four kids.
So I'm afraid we're going to have to go with the Chases.
Well...
Francis.
Tough break.
You know how sad that makes me?
Nothing!
- That doesn't even make sense.
- Who cares?
We get the car.
Oh, Penny.
You weren't using chad to torture me.
You were using him to bring down the Helbergs.
Actually, dad, I was doing both.
It was a win-win.
Well, I appreciate your mean-spirited loyalty.
- You were great in that commercial.
- No, you were.
I hate when we fight.
- Me, too.
I love your hair.
- I love my hair too.
What the hell?
Jill?
Jill, Jill, Jill... did you see that?
- See what?
- Two of their "kids" were frenching.
- You are sick.
They're brother and sister.
- I don't think they are.
He was in the family portrait.
And they were making out.
I think he's the brother, and he's the boyfriend.
- They've been lying to you.
- Don't believe this, Jill.
Now, let's go sign those contracts.
Did I mention that Carol is a notary?
W-wait a minute.
Nobody's signing anything.
I want to know who's who here.
Well, it's very simple, really.
This is Parker, Paige's brother.
And-and this is Tyler, Paige's boyfriend.
Oh, really?
They're boyfriend and girlfriend?
Then I want to see them kiss.
Well, you get your jollies somewhere else, sicko.
Mr. Chase, this is getting kind of weird.
Maybe we should just call the whole thing off.
Paige?
Kiss your boyfriend.
- Mom?
- Kiss him!
- I love this car.
- Me too.
Merci à Raceman pour les transcripts.
- Previously on The O.C.:
- What about that date?
- You're breaking up with me?
- It never could work.
- Cal, when you wanna date, let me know.
- It was an accident.
You accidentally slept with Marissa's mom or accidentally told Marissa?
- I just...
- Get out of here, Luke.
- I don't wanna see him again.
- What about your dad?
Kaitlin?
What am I supposed to do without you?
You are not leaving this house.
Or what?
You're gonna call the police or Dr. Milano?
You know what?
Go ahead.
In fact, why don't you call up Dad and Caleb?
I'd really love to tell them why I ran away.
You okay?
Yeah, it's just really sad.
It's just the movie, right?
That's the reason for the tears?
Yes.
I'm emotionally stable.
Besides, I'm not the only one crying.
I'm sorry, what?
I'm allergic, okay?
And there's so much pollen in here right now.
It's ridiculous.
- Tomorrow we're watching football, okay?
- Football season is five months away.
ESPN Classics, okay?
We'll watch old games.
Maybe next time we should see a comedy.
What?
No, no.
I can see sad movies.
Yeah.
No, I know you can.
I can't, Ryan, I'm sensitive.
- Okay, so, what now?
- Whatever Coop wants to do.
- Yeah, what do you wanna to do?
- I don't know.
It's getting late.
- So you wanna go back?
- Why don't we have a slumber party.
- I'll stay over.
- We all will.
We'll sleep in shifts.
- That way, one of us'll be up at all times.
- Doing what?
Hey, whatever you need us to do.
- Look, okay?
Guys, I'm fine.
- Yeah, yeah.
We know.
Why wouldn't you be?
I don't know, because the guy I lost my virginity to had sex with my mom.
- Oh, yeah, I remember that.
- Look, guys, it's really not that big a deal.
- Why don't we go to Jamba Juice?
- That's a great idea.
I love juice.
- Remember that thing with vitamin C?
- The boosts.
Free boosts.
Sit down.
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Well, it's not like I had any choice.
All your phone calls and e-mails.
I had to block you from my Buddy List you were so incessant.
- Blocked me?
I thought you were off-line.
You want something?
- The Razzmatazz is...
- Luke I told you, I'm not staying.
So tell me, what is it that's so important?
If you drink it too fast, you can get a brain freeze.
- So sip it slowly.
- That's good advice.
Okay, guys, I can drink a cold beverage.
I'm telling you, I'm really so not okay.
I guess we'll skip the Razzmatazz.
Hey.
Sorry.
I'm surprised that hasn't happened before.
I'm not saying I'm disappointed it hasn't happened before.
- I'm saying the mathematical probability...
- Crying during chick flicks.
- Walking in on me getting dressed.
- What's your point?
I'm not seeing what you're getting at.
- Do you work out?
- Not really.
Me neither.
I'm gonna go watch some hockey.
- Hockey season's over.
- Damn it.
- Where you going?
- To find Luke.
Beat the crap out of him.
- Where'll the can of whup-ass be opened?
- I'll go to his house, check the pier.
Have you considered our back yard?
- What's up, guys?
- Why don't you tell me?
- Calm down.
I didn't come to fight.
- You told me it was over.
It is.
Believe me.
I just...
I had to talk to her.
Next time you wanna talk to somebody, talk to Seth, me.
Anyone but her.
No one will talk to me.
Sleeping with your ex-girlfriend's mom kind of yields that result.
- I thought you were my friends.
- You got no friends.
I know.
- But I need your help.
- I'm not gonna help you.
- I'm leaving.
- Thanks for stopping by.
No, I mean, I'm leaving town.
Now that the divorce is final, my dad just wants to get out, so...
- We got family in Portland.
- You're going with him?
Don't tell anybody.
But that's what I was trying to tell Julie.
And that's what I wanna tell Marissa.
But I wanna tell her myself.
- Look, I don't know, Luke.
- Come on.
Please, please.
Five minutes.
It's not that much to ask, to say goodbye.
Then I'm gone.
Please.
- You okay?
- Yeah, just checking the paper for any impending natural disasters before tomorrow's grand opening.
- You're not nervous, are you?
- No, why be nervous?
If our pre-celebration tonight goes badly there'll be no time to fix it before tomorrow night.
I like to anticipate the worst at all times.
It's a Cohen family trait.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Yes!
- What is that?
- We're business partners.
- We needed our own secret handshake.
- Secret handshake?
- It's a guy thing.
- You couldn't possibly understand.
- Is this okay?
Or is it putting the "ho" in hostess?
Hailey, it looks great.
But it's not my restaurant.
Jimmy?
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, I mean we should ask Sandy because...
- I don't have shoes.
It'll serve to distract the customers, which is good, since they won't be drinking.
The Liquor Board is reneging on our liquor license.
- They can't.
They gave us a permit.
- Must be a mix-up.
I'll call the inspector.
See, that's why we Cohens are always right.
Because the worst always happens.
Come on, Hail.
I'll go get your shoes.
So you like the dress?
It's definitely a keeper.
So you'd sit in my section?
How do you even make waitress-speak sound so...?
Dirty?
I was gonna say "untoward," but, yeah.
Hail, it's your feet, not mine.
Can you believe this?
Okay, Coop.
So what's it gonna be, a little salt glow?
Little Tahitian body wrap?
Or maybe a lotion boot?
Okay, not really into exfoliating right now.
Besides, I promised Ryan I'd meet him for lunch at the pier.
Lunch at the pier.
Corn dogs and pizza.
You know, I read an article in Stuff.
It says carbs send endorphins to your brain and that makes you happy.
Oh, that's probably Ryan.
I gotta go grab it.
Where'd you leave your phone?
Your dad's room?
No, my room.
You have a room?
Wait.
Hello?
Yeah, Coop.
Like what you've done with the place.
Yeah, I guess I didn't really get around to unpacking.
How can you live like this?
Your T-shirts touch your sweaters.
I figured that if I didn't hang anything up then it wouldn't be so permanent.
Anyway, I gotta go meet Ryan.
So do you wanna come or...?
You know what?
Do you mind if I hang out here and watch TV?
The step-monster got her wisdom teeth pulled.
She's whacked out on Percocet leaving drool all over the house.
- Okay, sure.
Go ahead.
I'll see you later.
- I can't believe they're seeing each other.
- They're not.
- That's not what it looked like last night.
- Last night wasn't what it looked like.
I talked to Luke.
What?
You guys are still hanging out?
No, he showed up.
He wants to talk to you.
Apologize.
No.
There's no way I could forgive him.
- Maybe for Holly.
But not for this.
- I know but it would mean a lot to him.
What's important to him is really not so important to me.
That's a whole part of my life I'd just rather keep separate from this part of my life.
You know what we haven't done in a while?
Listen, I'm all for getting it on in exotic locales.
But I think your best friend's bedroom's just really disheveled.
Wow.
I like what she's done with the place.
The cardboard boxes, it feels very...
I'm getting like a garage-sale vibe.
Yes, I know.
See, they say your external life influences your internal life.
- Who says that?
- I read it in ELLE Decor.
- Your favorite magazine.
- You read?
No wonder she's so depressed.
We need to surprise her and fix it up.
Do you think giving her a little feng shui will help her forget her mom slept with her ex-boyfriend?
- It can't hurt.
Right.
Well, that's very sweet.
But if you put a mirror on that wall, it'd open up the energy flow in this room.
- I know where you're going with this.
- The hardware store.
The hardware store?
With, like, the bolts and the grouting and the Skil saws?
You don't like hardware stores and you cry during chick flicks.
Next thing you're gonna tell me, you walk in on Ryan changing.
Come on.
That's crazy.
Hey, let's go to the hardware store.
Peter Johnson, from the Liquor Board.
Am I right?
You came here about a month ago and granted us a liquor license.
Craziest thing.
I open my mail, and I read that our liquor license had been reneged.
Yes.
- Yeah, crazy?
- Yes, your license has been reneged.
Without a liquor license, this place can't turn a profit.
This is Newport Beach.
Everyone's a borderline alcoholic.
I'm sorry, but your temporary license was issued before your file landed in front of the newly appointed commissioner.
- So?
- The name Steve Peiser mean anything?
No.
Well, it might to Jimmy Cooper.
Turns out Mr. Cooper was Commissioner Peiser's financial advisor before he stole a quarter of a million dollars from him.
You're kidding me.
It was that financial loss that forced my boss out of retirement and back to work.
He saw Cooper's name on the file and said "no way."
Want my advice?
Have Mr. Cooper step down.
So, what do you wanna do for lunch?
I can do mac and cheese or mac and cheese.
Tough choice.
- I forgot how fun this was.
- Pretty fun.
You know, lunch could wait.
We are having a pretty big dinner.
- Not your dad, is it?
- No, he has a key.
- Mr. Nichol.
- Call me Caleb.
I'm not disturbing you, am I?
No.
Yeah, come in.
- Ryan.
- Mr. Nichol.
Would you mind if Marissa and I had a word, privately?
- Sure.
- Actually, Ryan and I don't have secrets.
It's important.
Well, then I definitely want him here.
What follows doesn't leave this room then, okay?
Sit down.
Marissa, your mother's a wonderful woman.
She is?
You're important to her.
You and I haven't spent a lot of time together but it was important to me to come and get your blessing.
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
- You wanna marry my mom?
- I love her very much.
- You don't know her.
- You should give Marissa some time.
- This is kind of a big deal.
- Impossible.
I intend to propose to her tonight at the restaurant with our friends and family in attendance.
Well, then I guess I can't stop you.
I'll see you both tonight.
Thanks for your time, dear.
And again, this is just between us.
I want it to be a surprise.
If my mom marries him, she's gonna be the most powerful woman in Newport.
Not if you tell Caleb the truth.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Did you talk to her?
- I tried.
- And?
- I don't think it's gonna happen, man.
- What do you mean?
- She's dealing with a lot of stuff now.
- Family stuff.
- She won't even see me for 30 seconds?
Her dad's restaurant's having its private opening tonight.
She's busy.
- I'm leaving town.
- She doesn't know.
- That's because she won't talk to me.
- Why don't you just write her a letter?
Write her a letter?
- I had your back with Oliver.
- You had sex with her mom.
I didn't just have sex with her, okay?
!
I'm in love with her!
- I was...
I am in love!
- Don't need to hear it.
But Marissa does.
I have to talk to her.
I have to explain.
- Luke, I wouldn't.
- I can't go without making it right.
I won't.
Okay, the plan is, we go to dinner for, like, 10 minutes, right?
Then we sneak out, come back here and make magic happen.
Excellent.
I'm extremely stealth.
1996, All-School Hide-and-Seek champion.
I do believe Joel Gordon is still looking for me.
The fool.
Hey!
Last year's yearbook.
- God, I love yearbooks.
- Listen, let's put it away because we've got a lot of work to do.
- Stop it!
- Let's just put it back.
Hey, it's you.
- We had a sailing team?
- Yeah.
It never got off the ground, but...
- You were in the Comic Book Club?
- I was the president and only member.
Let's see.
- We had a Film Preservation Society?
- Yeah, but it was a long time ago.
So you know, we don't have to...
It's not fun.
Was I really mean to you?
No.
That would have required you to speak to me.
Or anyone to speak to me.
A lot's changed in a year, huh?
Hey.
"Marissa, you're the greatest.
This summer will rock.
- Love you forever, Luke."
- Yeah.
A lot's definitely changed.
Marissa's gonna need a whole lot of feng shui.
Hey.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
You look sad.
I thought this would be a moment to celebrate.
So did I.
You know that mix-up with the liquor license?
- It's not such a mix-up.
- You're kidding.
It turns out the new commissioner is a former client of Jimmy's with a quarter-million dollar score to settle.
Without that license, there's no point opening.
I've been on the phone trying to call in favors.
I got nothing.
The guy is serious.
The only way he'll reconsider is if Jimmy steps down.
Leaves the business.
- You're not considering...
- No, of course not.
Well, there is one last option.
You're not gonna like it.
My dad can be very...
He can be very persuasive.
I may have to throw a few more of these back before you start bringing up Caleb.
Desperate times.
This is that.
Hey, man.
What's going on?
- Where you been?
- What?
- What?
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
Not one thing, okay?
- All right.
I'm gonna go pee, okay?
So if anyone asks, that's where I am.
For a while.
Right.
- He's getting weirder.
- Didn't think that was possible.
Marissa.
Mom.
That's the warmest conversation I've had with her in weeks.
I'll have a word, see if I can't help.
I have been known to be quite persuasive.
So I've heard.
What's with Dad these days?
He's all warm and mushy.
Don't know.
Maybe it's the new blood-thinning medication he's on.
What about you?
How's your romantic life?
Oh, you know me.
Not much.
Vince, thank you so much.
How excited is Jimmy?
He's like a totally different person.
It's so great.
Let's hope tomorrow night goes as well as tonight.
- Pat.
Thanks for coming by.
- My pleasure.
Though I gotta say, Nana Cohen's meat loaf, trouncing Grandma Cooper's.
- She would expect no less.
- How'd it go today with the Liquor Board?
- All sorted out?
- Working on it.
Working on it.
Enjoy it, Jimmy.
Moments like this don't happen every day.
I know.
It's fantastic.
- Hey.
- How you doing?
I'm just happy you're here, so I don't have to do this alone.
You know me.
Can't get enough of this stuff.
Excuse me, everyone.
I have something I'd like to say.
I hope you're all enjoying yourselves tonight as much as I am.
Though my enjoyment of life over the last few months goes beyond this restaurant to a very special lady, Julie Cooper.
What's he doing here?
Julie did a fantastic job on the d Ácor, didn't she?
Hey, come on, let's go.
And...
- It's here on this opening night...
- Nobody'll talk to me or even look at me.
- Had a little bit to drink?
- I'd like to show her how special she is.
I gotta tell Marissa it wasn't just sex.
I love her mom.
Okay, I don't think that's a good idea.
Julie Cooper will you marry me?
Oh, my God!
Yes, of course I will, Cal.
Kiki!
Luke.
Hey.
Luke.
Hey!
- Look, Luke...
- Don't make me!
Just give me your keys.
Let me drive you home.
What home?
I can't believe he just showed up here.
- I need your car.
I need to go after him.
- No.
It's like you're saying he did nothing wrong.
I'm not taking his side.
I'm not taking any side.
You know what?
Maybe you should.
He should have time alone to think about what he did.
- Feel bad about it.
- He does feel bad...
- That's why he's leaving.
- What are you talking about?
His dad's moving to Portland.
He's moving with him.
Because of what happened.
Can I have your keys?
He's had a lot to drink.
- That's cool.
I didn't want any, anyway.
- My dad is marrying Julie Cooper.
Julie Cooper is my stepmom.
- Maybe we'll get you another bottle.
- Drink up.
This is an unholy alliance, two storm fronts colliding.
It's the apocalypse for us.
- Maybe you wanna lay off the sauce.
- Think of it.
All the time we were growing up and you'd come over for dinner you'd go sailing with my dad, did you ever think he would marry your ex-wife?
- Yeah, give me a glass.
- Never.
Jimbo, the way I see it, this might be the best thing that could happen to you.
There is nothing good about it.
This marriage is an asteroid that hit the Earth.
Now we have to see what species survives.
I did it.
Look.
Wow, you hit a nail!
Bob Vila's your bitch, Cohen.
What?
!
Why?
!
- This is not supposed to happen.
- You have to find the stud.
- You mean like you did, Summer?
- Just get me the stud finder.
Oh, Summer, I think you are the stud finder.
- See this hammer in my hand?
- What does the stud finder look like?
- And the level.
- What is a level?
- Don't you know what a level is?
- What you advance to in a video game.
That's funny.
Yeah.
The tool doesn't know about tools.
My people, we don't really build.
We're not what you would call "handy."
We hire people to do it.
Why don't we just get a contractor?
Or I can paint.
And here I thought you could only paint the ceiling.
Marissa, hey, listen, I...
No, no.
It's me, man.
- I'm fine, man.
- You don't sound fine.
Well, you know, I'm just having a few beers up at the park rocking out to Seger.
You know the drill.
Not really.
Hey, do me a favor, Ryan.
Tell Marissa I get it.
Okay?
I don 't deserve her forgiveness.
I'm...
I'm scum.
I'm...
All I ever did was let her down.
Tell her that.
No, just tell me where you are, all right?
You can't leave without saying goodbye, right?
Right.
Goodbye.
Damn it!
I'm not here.
Leave a message.
Julie.
I'm...
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I need to see you.
I'm coming...
I'm coming to see you.
You owe me a goodbye!
Without a liquor license, we'll be belly-up in no time.
- Really?
Cal, I had no idea.
- There's no point in opening the place.
That's why I was hoping I could ask you to do me a favor.
- What?
- Wait, did you not hear me?
I just wanted to hear you say it again.
If it was up to me, I'd rather take the hit than talk with you.
But it's Jimmy.
- The Lighthouse is all he's got.
- Lf you drop him, they'd issue the license.
But you're too much of a martyr.
Listen, Sanford never mix business with friendship.
- You're right.
From now on, I'm doing all my deals with you.
When you came to me about Uncle Shaun, I said yes.
You owe me.
I don't wanna owe you.
I wanna hold it over your head.
Need water.
Tried to lie down, got the spins.
Well, I better get back to my bride-to-be.
Oh, yeah.
Definitely might vomit.
Luke, call us when you get this.
Ryan.
When I saw him at the party last night I wished for something like this to happen.
It's not your fault.
- How is he?
- Well, he's out of surgery.
He's pretty much out of commission right now, but the worst is behind him.
I should call my parents.
You guys he's gonna be asleep for a while.
You should go home.
- Maybe we should, so we could finish.
- Or we could sleep.
You know, I'm really glad that Luke's gonna be okay.
We'll come back.
Actually, I'm gonna stay.
You know, just in case.
Okay.
Then I'll stay too.
I heard he'd been drinking which makes one less inspired to go after our liquor license.
- Can I get you something to eat?
- No, no, I'm good.
Don't worry about going to city hall.
I'll deal with them.
You hold down the fort.
That's not necessary.
You hang at the Lighthouse.
Man the ship.
Are we gonna refer to the restaurant as a ship or a fort?
Well, right now it's a sinking ship.
Okay, not the most inspiring metaphor on our opening night.
Why don't you sit down?
I can't.
I gotta go see what the holdup is with the liquor license.
You're the holdup, Jimmy.
Does the name Steve Peiser mean anything to you?
When he went back to work, after his financial advisor lost his life savings he got a job as commissioner of the Liquor Board.
This restaurant was supposed to be a chance for me to escape from my past.
I guess there is no escaping, huh?
Well, we do have one possible Houdini-esque escape left.
Caleb.
I asked him for help.
- You hate asking him for help.
- This was no exception.
I had no choice.
You did.
You could've told me the truth and asked me to bow out.
Like I said, I had no choice.
Satellite Pharmacy to room 607.
Satellite Pharmacy, room 607.
Hey, guys.
He's up.
You should go home.
And thanks for waiting, all right?
Wait.
Will you tell him that I'm here and I'd like to see him?
I'll start auditioning bands right away.
I need to start soliciting recommendations for the videographer and the photographer, the engravers.
You know, I should ask Diane Kahn.
She's been married, like, at least a half a dozen times.
Why aren't you more excited?
Oh, Julie, it was a rough night.
Hey, where are you going?
Why aren't you asleep?
Because Summer's a slave driver.
Is Ryan back from the hospital yet?
- Hospital?
- Oh, didn't you hear?
Luke wrapped his truck around a telephone pole last night.
- He did?
- Just a few blocks from here.
He was drinking.
So unlike him.
Well, I guess he just never really recovered from everything with his father.
You know, the humiliation, his family being torn apart.
Yeah, that must be it.
Pour me a bloody mary, will you, James?
Since it'll be the last drink we serve.
- What?
That's it?
- Hook, line and sinker.
No license.
No opening.
No restaurant.
- No comeback.
- That's the best you could do?
- As big a badass as you are?
- Didn't have an effect on this Peiser fella.
You know how to piss people off.
You could teach me a thing or two.
- You seem awfully glib.
- Everything happens for a reason.
Could you at least feign a little sensitivity at our misfortune?
You know what they say:
One man's misfortune is another man's fortune.
- Who says that?
- I do.
- I've never seen him smile.
- I didn't know he had teeth.
Make yourselves a couple of drinks, fellas.
We should talk.
Cheers.
Are you okay?
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean for this to happen.
Any of it.
I just...
I didn't have anyone.
I had no one.
Not my family.
I don't know, you know?
But I'm gonna go away.
Give things a chance to go back to normal for you.
Because I know as long as I'm here, they won't.
But I need to know one thing before I go.
Can you forgive me?
Yeah.
Yes.
Luke I'll miss you.
Who would've thought when you moved to town that I'd be the one who had to leave?
I thought I was gonna live in Newport my whole life.
So you'll start a new life.
Yeah, maybe I'll show up in Portland and fall for the chick dating the captain of the football team.
And he can kick your ass.
Yeah.
Welcome to Portland, bitch.
Well, I'll e-mail you.
Maybe I'll drop back in say hey.
Good luck, man.
Want me to take you home?
I hate her so much.
I mean, she tried to drive you out.
She almost destroyed my dad.
She nearly killed Luke.
I have to do something.
Okay.
So where we going?
Marissa.
Hello.
Come in.
Is everything all right?
Actually, no, it's not.
We need to talk about my mom.
I was just thinking the same thing.
Sit down, please.
I know things between you and your mom have been rocky this year.
- Can you both put the past behind you?
- You have no idea what she's like or what she's done.
- I know.
I know.
Everything.
We should use this occasion as a chance to heal.
Make a fresh start.
Family is very important to me, Marissa.
I want us all to be a real family.
- Your sister deserves that, so do you.
- We already have a dad.
I'm well aware.
I'm not trying to replace him, push him out.
Quite the opposite, in fact.
As of today I'm the only chance your father has.
- What are you talking about?
This morning I offered to buy the Balboa Lighthouse from both he and Sandy for several million dollars.
Considering the fact that the restaurant will never open, make a cent I'd say it was a pretty good deal.
However, if I were to change my mind decide it was a bad investment, lose my checkbook your father would be ruined.
Penniless.
Run out of town.
Which is where I come in.
You are very important to your mother.
She is very important to me.
- Be part of our family.
- Which means what, exactly?
Well, you're already part of the wedding.
When your mom moves in you come and live with us too.
- You're joking, right?
It would mean everything to her.
And if I do this, then you'll definitely buy the restaurant?
This conversation would have to remain confidential.
You wouldn't want my mom to know you blackmailed me into living with her?
So do we have a deal?
Wonderful.
Now, was there something else that you wanted to ask me about?
- You okay?
- I'm a prisoner in my own life.
I'm great.
- Well, you did what you needed to do.
- Yeah.
- I guess I just need some sleep.
- Yeah, okay.
I'll call you...
I told you, no touching anything, ever.
- You're such a dandy, Cohen.
- You're a dandy, woman.
- Fine, take it.
- No.
I don't want it.
Oh, my God!
Those are tears of joy, yes?
I...
I don't even know what to say.
Summer did all the building.
And the heavy lifting.
And the wiring of the electronics.
But I painted.
I know you're a Paris fan.
It's amazing.
This is so cool.
We looked through your toys and couldn't find any plastic horses but we did find this.
Share Bear!
Wow!
Yeah, she'll watch over you with her Care Bear stare.
How do you know about the Care Bear stare?
- I painted that.
- Yes, you did.
I did.
Thanks, you guys.
- I really needed this.
- Yeah, it was nothing.
For you.
You should see Cohen with a power saw.
How do you know about the Care Bear stare?
- Dude, leave it alone.
- No, I'm just curious.
- Isn't he cute?
- It's like...
It's kind of...
You okay?
Yeah, it's just really sad.
It's just the movie, right?
That's the reason for the tears?
Yes.
I'm emotionally stable.
Besides, I'm not the only one crying.
I'm sorry, what?
I'm allergic, okay?
And there's so much pollen in here right now.
It's ridiculous.
- Tomorrow we're watching football, okay?
- Football season is five months away.
ESPN Classics, okay?
We'll watch old games.
Maybe next time we should see a comedy.
What?
No, no.
I can see sad movies.
Yeah.
No, I know you can.
I can't, Ryan, I'm sensitive.
- Okay, so, what now?
- Whatever Coop wants to do.
- Yeah, what do you wanna to do?
- I don't know.
It's getting late.
- So you wanna go back?
- Why don't we have a slumber party.
- I'll stay over.
- We all will.
We'll sleep in shifts.
- That way, one of us'll be up at all times.
- Doing what?
Hey, whatever you need us to do.
- Look, okay?
Guys, I'm fine.
- Yeah, yeah.
We know.
Why wouldn't you be?
I don't know, because the guy I lost my virginity to had sex with my mom.
- Oh, yeah, I remember that.
- Look, guys, it's really not that big a deal.
- Why don't we go to Jamba Juice?
- That's a great idea.
I love juice.
- Remember that thing with vitamin C?
- The boosts.
Free boosts.
Sit down.
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Well, it's not like I had any choice.
All your phone calls and e-mails.
I had to block you from my Buddy List you were so incessant.
- Blocked me?
I thought you were off-line.
You want something?
- The Razzmatazz is...
- Luke I told you, I'm not staying.
So tell me, what is it that's so important?
If you drink it too fast, you can get a brain freeze.
- So sip it slowly.
- That's good advice.
Okay, guys, I can drink a cold beverage.
I'm telling you, I'm really so not okay.
I guess we'll skip the Razzmatazz.
Hey.
Sorry.
I'm surprised that hasn't happened before.
I'm not saying I'm disappointed it hasn't happened before.
- I'm saying the mathematical probability...
- Crying during chick flicks.
- Walking in on me getting dressed.
- What's your point?
I'm not seeing what you're getting at.
- Do you work out?
- Not really.
Me neither.
I'm gonna go watch some hockey.
- Hockey season's over.
- Damn it.
- Where you going?
- To find Luke.
Beat the crap out of him.
- Where'll the can of whup-ass be opened?
- I'll go to his house, check the pier.
Have you considered our back yard?
- What's up, guys?
- Why don't you tell me?
- Calm down.
I didn't come to fight.
- You told me it was over.
It is.
Believe me.
I just...
I had to talk to her.
Next time you wanna talk to somebody, talk to Seth, me.
Anyone but her.
No one will talk to me.
Sleeping with your ex-girlfriend's mom kind of yields that result.
- I thought you were my friends.
- You got no friends.
I know.
- But I need your help.
- I'm not gonna help you.
- I'm leaving.
- Thanks for stopping by.
No, I mean, I'm leaving town.
Now that the divorce is final, my dad just wants to get out, so...
- We got family in Portland.
- You're going with him?
Don't tell anybody.
But that's what I was trying to tell Julie.
And that's what I wanna tell Marissa.
But I wanna tell her myself.
- Look, I don't know, Luke.
- Come on.
Please, please.
Five minutes.
It's not that much to ask, to say goodbye.
Then I'm gone.
Please.
- You okay?
- Yeah, just checking the paper for any impending natural disasters before tomorrow's grand opening.
- You're not nervous, are you?
- No, why be nervous?
If our pre-celebration tonight goes badly there'll be no time to fix it before tomorrow night.
I like to anticipate the worst at all times.
It's a Cohen family trait.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Yes!
- What is that?
- We're business partners.
- We needed our own secret handshake.
- Secret handshake?
- It's a guy thing.
- You couldn't possibly understand.
- Is this okay?
Or is it putting the "ho" in hostess?
Hailey, it looks great.
But it's not my restaurant.
Jimmy?
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, I mean we should ask Sandy because...
- I don't have shoes.
It'll serve to distract the customers, which is good, since they won't be drinking.
The Liquor Board is reneging on our liquor license.
- They can't.
They gave us a permit.
- Must be a mix-up.
I'll call the inspector.
See, that's why we Cohens are always right.
Because the worst always happens.
Come on, Hail.
I'll go get your shoes.
So you like the dress?
It's definitely a keeper.
So you'd sit in my section?
How do you even make waitress-speak sound so...?
Dirty?
I was gonna say "untoward," but, yeah.
Hail, it's your feet, not mine.
Can you believe this?
Okay, Coop.
So what's it gonna be, a little salt glow?
Little Tahitian body wrap?
Or maybe a lotion boot?
Okay, not really into exfoliating right now.
Besides, I promised Ryan I'd meet him for lunch at the pier.
Lunch at the pier.
Corn dogs and pizza.
You know, I read an article in Stuff.
It says carbs send endorphins to your brain and that makes you happy.
Oh, that's probably Ryan.
I gotta go grab it.
Where'd you leave your phone?
Your dad's room?
No, my room.
You have a room?
Wait.
Hello?
Yeah, Coop.
Like what you've done with the place.
Yeah, I guess I didn't really get around to unpacking.
How can you live like this?
Your T-shirts touch your sweaters.
I figured that if I didn't hang anything up then it wouldn't be so permanent.
Anyway, I gotta go meet Ryan.
So do you wanna come or...?
You know what?
Do you mind if I hang out here and watch TV?
The step-monster got her wisdom teeth pulled.
She's whacked out on Percocet leaving drool all over the house.
- Okay, sure.
Go ahead.
I'll see you later.
- I can't believe they're seeing each other.
- They're not.
- That's not what it looked like last night.
- Last night wasn't what it looked like.
I talked to Luke.
What?
You guys are still hanging out?
No, he showed up.
He wants to talk to you.
Apologize.
No.
There's no way I could forgive him.
- Maybe for Holly.
But not for this.
- I know but it would mean a lot to him.
What's important to him is really not so important to me.
That's a whole part of my life I'd just rather keep separate from this part of my life.
You know what we haven't done in a while?
Listen, I'm all for getting it on in exotic locales.
But I think your best friend's bedroom's just really disheveled.
Wow.
I like what she's done with the place.
The cardboard boxes, it feels very...
I'm getting like a garage-sale vibe.
Yes, I know.
See, they say your external life influences your internal life.
- Who says that?
- I read it in ELLE Decor.
- Your favorite magazine.
- You read?
No wonder she's so depressed.
We need to surprise her and fix it up.
Do you think giving her a little feng shui will help her forget her mom slept with her ex-boyfriend?
- It can't hurt.
Right.
Well, that's very sweet.
But if you put a mirror on that wall, it'd open up the energy flow in this room.
- I know where you're going with this.
- The hardware store.
The hardware store?
With, like, the bolts and the grouting and the Skil saws?
You don't like hardware stores and you cry during chick flicks.
Next thing you're gonna tell me, you walk in on Ryan changing.
Come on.
That's crazy.
Hey, let's go to the hardware store.
Peter Johnson, from the Liquor Board.
Am I right?
You came here about a month ago and granted us a liquor license.
Craziest thing.
I open my mail, and I read that our liquor license had been reneged.
Yes.
- Yeah, crazy?
- Yes, your license has been reneged.
Without a liquor license, this place can't turn a profit.
This is Newport Beach.
Everyone's a borderline alcoholic.
I'm sorry, but your temporary license was issued before your file landed in front of the newly appointed commissioner.
- So?
- The name Steve Peiser mean anything?
No.
Well, it might to Jimmy Cooper.
Turns out Mr. Cooper was Commissioner Peiser's financial advisor before he stole a quarter of a million dollars from him.
You're kidding me.
It was that financial loss that forced my boss out of retirement and back to work.
He saw Cooper's name on the file and said "no way."
Want my advice?
Have Mr. Cooper step down.
So, what do you wanna do for lunch?
I can do mac and cheese or mac and cheese.
Tough choice.
- I forgot how fun this was.
- Pretty fun.
You know, lunch could wait.
We are having a pretty big dinner.
- Not your dad, is it?
- No, he has a key.
- Mr. Nichol.
- Call me Caleb.
I'm not disturbing you, am I?
No.
Yeah, come in.
- Ryan.
- Mr. Nichol.
Would you mind if Marissa and I had a word, privately?
- Sure.
- Actually, Ryan and I don't have secrets.
It's important.
Well, then I definitely want him here.
What follows doesn't leave this room then, okay?
Sit down.
Marissa, your mother's a wonderful woman.
She is?
You're important to her.
You and I haven't spent a lot of time together but it was important to me to come and get your blessing.
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
- You wanna marry my mom?
- I love her very much.
- You don't know her.
- You should give Marissa some time.
- This is kind of a big deal.
- Impossible.
I intend to propose to her tonight at the restaurant with our friends and family in attendance.
Well, then I guess I can't stop you.
I'll see you both tonight.
Thanks for your time, dear.
And again, this is just between us.
I want it to be a surprise.
If my mom marries him, she's gonna be the most powerful woman in Newport.
Not if you tell Caleb the truth.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Did you talk to her?
- I tried.
- And?
- I don't think it's gonna happen, man.
- What do you mean?
- She's dealing with a lot of stuff now.
- Family stuff.
- She won't even see me for 30 seconds?
Her dad's restaurant's having its private opening tonight.
She's busy.
- I'm leaving town.
- She doesn't know.
- That's because she won't talk to me.
- Why don't you just write her a letter?
Write her a letter?
- I had your back with Oliver.
- You had sex with her mom.
I didn't just have sex with her, okay?
!
I'm in love with her!
- I was...
I am in love!
- Don't need to hear it.
But Marissa does.
I have to talk to her.
I have to explain.
- Luke, I wouldn't.
- I can't go without making it right.
I won't.
Okay, the plan is, we go to dinner for, like, 10 minutes, right?
Then we sneak out, come back here and make magic happen.
Excellent.
I'm extremely stealth.
1996, All-School Hide-and-Seek champion.
I do believe Joel Gordon is still looking for me.
The fool.
Hey!
Last year's yearbook.
- God, I love yearbooks.
- Listen, let's put it away because we've got a lot of work to do.
- Stop it!
- Let's just put it back.
Hey, it's you.
- We had a sailing team?
- Yeah.
It never got off the ground, but...
- You were in the Comic Book Club?
- I was the president and only member.
Let's see.
- We had a Film Preservation Society?
- Yeah, but it was a long time ago.
So you know, we don't have to...
It's not fun.
Was I really mean to you?
No.
That would have required you to speak to me.
Or anyone to speak to me.
A lot's changed in a year, huh?
Hey.
"Marissa, you're the greatest.
This summer will rock.
- Love you forever, Luke."
- Yeah.
A lot's definitely changed.
Marissa's gonna need a whole lot of feng shui.
Hey.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
You look sad.
I thought this would be a moment to celebrate.
So did I.
You know that mix-up with the liquor license?
- It's not such a mix-up.
- You're kidding.
It turns out the new commissioner is a former client of Jimmy's with a quarter-million dollar score to settle.
Without that license, there's no point opening.
I've been on the phone trying to call in favors.
I got nothing.
The guy is serious.
The only way he'll reconsider is if Jimmy steps down.
Leaves the business.
- You're not considering...
- No, of course not.
Well, there is one last option.
You're not gonna like it.
My dad can be very...
He can be very persuasive.
I may have to throw a few more of these back before you start bringing up Caleb.
Desperate times.
This is that.
Hey, man.
What's going on?
- Where you been?
- What?
- What?
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
Not one thing, okay?
- All right.
I'm gonna go pee, okay?
So if anyone asks, that's where I am.
For a while.
Right.
- He's getting weirder.
- Didn't think that was possible.
Marissa.
Mom.
That's the warmest conversation I've had with her in weeks.
I'll have a word, see if I can't help.
I have been known to be quite persuasive.
So I've heard.
What's with Dad these days?
He's all warm and mushy.
Don't know.
Maybe it's the new blood-thinning medication he's on.
What about you?
How's your romantic life?
Oh, you know me.
Not much.
Vince, thank you so much.
How excited is Jimmy?
He's like a totally different person.
It's so great.
Let's hope tomorrow night goes as well as tonight.
- Pat.
Thanks for coming by.
- My pleasure.
Though I gotta say, Nana Cohen's meat loaf, trouncing Grandma Cooper's.
- She would expect no less.
- How'd it go today with the Liquor Board?
- All sorted out?
- Working on it.
Working on it.
Enjoy it, Jimmy.
Moments like this don't happen every day.
I know.
It's fantastic.
- Hey.
- How you doing?
I'm just happy you're here, so I don't have to do this alone.
You know me.
Can't get enough of this stuff.
Excuse me, everyone.
I have something I'd like to say.
I hope you're all enjoying yourselves tonight as much as I am.
Though my enjoyment of life over the last few months goes beyond this restaurant to a very special lady, Julie Cooper.
What's he doing here?
Julie did a fantastic job on the d Ácor, didn't she?
Hey, come on, let's go.
And...
- It's here on this opening night...
- Nobody'll talk to me or even look at me.
- Had a little bit to drink?
- I'd like to show her how special she is.
I gotta tell Marissa it wasn't just sex.
I love her mom.
Okay, I don't think that's a good idea.
Julie Cooper will you marry me?
Oh, my God!
Yes, of course I will, Cal.
Kiki!
Luke.
Hey.
Luke.
Hey!
- Look, Luke...
- Don't make me!
Just give me your keys.
Let me drive you home.
What home?
I can't believe he just showed up here.
- I need your car.
I need to go after him.
- No.
It's like you're saying he did nothing wrong.
I'm not taking his side.
I'm not taking any side.
You know what?
Maybe you should.
He should have time alone to think about what he did.
- Feel bad about it.
- He does feel bad...
- That's why he's leaving.
- What are you talking about?
His dad's moving to Portland.
He's moving with him.
Because of what happened.
Can I have your keys?
He's had a lot to drink.
- That's cool.
I didn't want any, anyway.
- My dad is marrying Julie Cooper.
Julie Cooper is my stepmom.
- Maybe we'll get you another bottle.
- Drink up.
This is an unholy alliance, two storm fronts colliding.
It's the apocalypse for us.
- Maybe you wanna lay off the sauce.
- Think of it.
All the time we were growing up and you'd come over for dinner you'd go sailing with my dad, did you ever think he would marry your ex-wife?
- Yeah, give me a glass.
- Never.
Jimbo, the way I see it, this might be the best thing that could happen to you.
There is nothing good about it.
This marriage is an asteroid that hit the Earth.
Now we have to see what species survives.
I did it.
Look.
Wow, you hit a nail!
Bob Vila's your bitch, Cohen.
What?
!
Why?
!
- This is not supposed to happen.
- You have to find the stud.
- You mean like you did, Summer?
- Just get me the stud finder.
Oh, Summer, I think you are the stud finder.
- See this hammer in my hand?
- What does the stud finder look like?
- And the level.
- What is a level?
- Don't you know what a level is?
- What you advance to in a video game.
That's funny.
Yeah.
The tool doesn't know about tools.
My people, we don't really build.
We're not what you would call "handy."
We hire people to do it.
Why don't we just get a contractor?
Or I can paint.
And here I thought you could only paint the ceiling.
Marissa, hey, listen, I...
No, no.
It's me, man.
- I'm fine, man.
- You don't sound fine.
Well, you know, I'm just having a few beers up at the park rocking out to Seger.
You know the drill.
Not really.
Hey, do me a favor, Ryan.
Tell Marissa I get it.
Okay?
I don 't deserve her forgiveness.
I'm...
I'm scum.
I'm...
All I ever did was let her down.
Tell her that.
No, just tell me where you are, all right?
You can't leave without saying goodbye, right?
Right.
Goodbye.
Damn it!
I'm not here.
Leave a message.
Julie.
I'm...
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I need to see you.
I'm coming...
I'm coming to see you.
You owe me a goodbye!
Without a liquor license, we'll be belly-up in no time.
- Really?
Cal, I had no idea.
- There's no point in opening the place.
That's why I was hoping I could ask you to do me a favor.
- What?
- Wait, did you not hear me?
I just wanted to hear you say it again.
If it was up to me, I'd rather take the hit than talk with you.
But it's Jimmy.
- The Lighthouse is all he's got.
- Lf you drop him, they'd issue the license.
But you're too much of a martyr.
Listen, Sanford never mix business with friendship.
- You're right.
From now on, I'm doing all my deals with you.
When you came to me about Uncle Shaun, I said yes.
You owe me.
I don't wanna owe you.
I wanna hold it over your head.
Need water.
Tried to lie down, got the spins.
Well, I better get back to my bride-to-be.
Oh, yeah.
Definitely might vomit.
Luke, call us when you get this.
Ryan.
When I saw him at the party last night I wished for something like this to happen.
It's not your fault.
- How is he?
- Well, he's out of surgery.
He's pretty much out of commission right now, but the worst is behind him.
I should call my parents.
You guys he's gonna be asleep for a while.
You should go home.
- Maybe we should, so we could finish.
- Or we could sleep.
You know, I'm really glad that Luke's gonna be okay.
We'll come back.
Actually, I'm gonna stay.
You know, just in case.
Okay.
Then I'll stay too.
I heard he'd been drinking which makes one less inspired to go after our liquor license.
- Can I get you something to eat?
- No, no, I'm good.
Don't worry about going to city hall.
I'll deal with them.
You hold down the fort.
That's not necessary.
You hang at the Lighthouse.
Man the ship.
Are we gonna refer to the restaurant as a ship or a fort?
Well, right now it's a sinking ship.
Okay, not the most inspiring metaphor on our opening night.
Why don't you sit down?
I can't.
I gotta go see what the holdup is with the liquor license.
You're the holdup, Jimmy.
Does the name Steve Peiser mean anything to you?
When he went back to work, after his financial advisor lost his life savings he got a job as commissioner of the Liquor Board.
This restaurant was supposed to be a chance for me to escape from my past.
I guess there is no escaping, huh?
Well, we do have one possible Houdini-esque escape left.
Caleb.
I asked him for help.
- You hate asking him for help.
- This was no exception.
I had no choice.
You did.
You could've told me the truth and asked me to bow out.
Like I said, I had no choice.
Satellite Pharmacy to room 607.
Satellite Pharmacy, room 607.
Hey, guys.
He's up.
You should go home.
And thanks for waiting, all right?
Wait.
Will you tell him that I'm here and I'd like to see him?
I'll start auditioning bands right away.
I need to start soliciting recommendations for the videographer and the photographer, the engravers.
You know, I should ask Diane Kahn.
She's been married, like, at least a half a dozen times.
Why aren't you more excited?
Oh, Julie, it was a rough night.
Hey, where are you going?
Why aren't you asleep?
Because Summer's a slave driver.
Is Ryan back from the hospital yet?
- Hospital?
- Oh, didn't you hear?
Luke wrapped his truck around a telephone pole last night.
- He did?
- Just a few blocks from here.
He was drinking.
So unlike him.
Well, I guess he just never really recovered from everything with his father.
You know, the humiliation, his family being torn apart.
Yeah, that must be it.
Pour me a bloody mary, will you, James?
Since it'll be the last drink we serve.
- What?
That's it?
- Hook, line and sinker.
No license.
No opening.
No restaurant.
- No comeback.
- That's the best you could do?
- As big a badass as you are?
- Didn't have an effect on this Peiser fella.
You know how to piss people off.
You could teach me a thing or two.
- You seem awfully glib.
- Everything happens for a reason.
Could you at least feign a little sensitivity at our misfortune?
You know what they say:
One man's misfortune is another man's fortune.
- Who says that?
- I do.
- I've never seen him smile.
- I didn't know he had teeth.
Make yourselves a couple of drinks, fellas.
We should talk.
Cheers.
Are you okay?
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean for this to happen.
Any of it.
I just...
I didn't have anyone.
I had no one.
Not my family.
I don't know, you know?
But I'm gonna go away.
Give things a chance to go back to normal for you.
Because I know as long as I'm here, they won't.
But I need to know one thing before I go.
Can you forgive me?
Yeah.
Yes.
Luke I'll miss you.
Who would've thought when you moved to town that I'd be the one who had to leave?
I thought I was gonna live in Newport my whole life.
So you'll start a new life.
Yeah, maybe I'll show up in Portland and fall for the chick dating the captain of the football team.
And he can kick your ass.
Yeah.
Welcome to Portland, bitch.
Well, I'll e-mail you.
Maybe I'll drop back in say hey.
Good luck, man.
Want me to take you home?
I hate her so much.
I mean, she tried to drive you out.
She almost destroyed my dad.
She nearly killed Luke.
I have to do something.
Okay.
So where we going?
Marissa.
Hello.
Come in.
Is everything all right?
Actually, no, it's not.
We need to talk about my mom.
I was just thinking the same thing.
Sit down, please.
I know things between you and your mom have been rocky this year.
- Can you both put the past behind you?
- You have no idea what she's like or what she's done.
- I know.
I know.
Everything.
We should use this occasion as a chance to heal.
Make a fresh start.
Family is very important to me, Marissa.
I want us all to be a real family.
- Your sister deserves that, so do you.
- We already have a dad.
I'm well aware.
I'm not trying to replace him, push him out.
Quite the opposite, in fact.
As of today I'm the only chance your father has.
- What are you talking about?
This morning I offered to buy the Balboa Lighthouse from both he and Sandy for several million dollars.
Considering the fact that the restaurant will never open, make a cent I'd say it was a pretty good deal.
However, if I were to change my mind decide it was a bad investment, lose my checkbook your father would be ruined.
Penniless.
Run out of town.
Which is where I come in.
You are very important to your mother.
She is very important to me.
- Be part of our family.
- Which means what, exactly?
Well, you're already part of the wedding.
When your mom moves in you come and live with us too.
- You're joking, right?
It would mean everything to her.
And if I do this, then you'll definitely buy the restaurant?
This conversation would have to remain confidential.
You wouldn't want my mom to know you blackmailed me into living with her?
So do we have a deal?
Wonderful.
Now, was there something else that you wanted to ask me about?
- You okay?
- I'm a prisoner in my own life.
I'm great.
- Well, you did what you needed to do.
- Yeah.
- I guess I just need some sleep.
- Yeah, okay.
I'll call you...
I told you, no touching anything, ever.
- You're such a dandy, Cohen.
- You're a dandy, woman.
- Fine, take it.
- No.
I don't want it.
Oh, my God!
Those are tears of joy, yes?
I...
I don't even know what to say.
Summer did all the building.
And the heavy lifting.
And the wiring of the electronics.
But I painted.
I know you're a Paris fan.
It's amazing.
This is so cool.
We looked through your toys and couldn't find any plastic horses but we did find this.
Share Bear!
Wow!
Yeah, she'll watch over you with her Care Bear stare.
How do you know about the Care Bear stare?
- I painted that.
- Yes, you did.
I did.
Thanks, you guys.
- I really needed this.
- Yeah, it was nothing.
For you.
You should see Cohen with a power saw.
How do you know about the Care Bear stare?
- Dude, leave it alone.
- No, I'm just curious.
- Isn't he cute?
- It's like...
It's kind of...
- Previously on The O.C.:
- What about that date?
- You're breaking up with me?
- It never could work.
- Cal, when you wanna date, let me know.
- It was an accident.
You accidentally slept with Marissa's mom or accidentally told Marissa?
- I just...
- Get out of here, Luke.
- I don't wanna see him again.
- What about your dad?
Kaitlin?
What am I supposed to do without you?
You are not leaving this house.
Or what?
You're gonna call the police or Dr. Milano?
You know what?
Go ahead.
In fact, why don't you call up Dad and Caleb?
I'd really love to tell them why I ran away.
You okay?
Yeah, it's just really sad.
It's just the movie, right?
That's the reason for the tears?
Yes.
I'm emotionally stable.
Besides, I'm not the only one crying.
I'm sorry, what?
I'm allergic, okay?
And there's so much pollen in here right now.
It's ridiculous.
- Tomorrow we're watching football, okay?
- Football season is five months away.
ESPN Classics, okay?
We'll watch old games.
Maybe next time we should see a comedy.
What?
No, no.
I can see sad movies.
Yeah.
No, I know you can.
I can't, Ryan, I'm sensitive.
- Okay, so, what now?
- Whatever Coop wants to do.
- Yeah, what do you wanna to do?
- I don't know.
It's getting late.
- So you wanna go back?
- Why don't we have a slumber party.
- I'll stay over.
- We all will.
We'll sleep in shifts.
- That way, one of us'll be up at all times.
- Doing what?
Hey, whatever you need us to do.
- Look, okay?
Guys, I'm fine.
- Yeah, yeah.
We know.
Why wouldn't you be?
I don't know, because the guy I lost my virginity to had sex with my mom.
- Oh, yeah, I remember that.
- Look, guys, it's really not that big a deal.
- Why don't we go to Jamba Juice?
- That's a great idea.
I love juice.
- Remember that thing with vitamin C?
- The boosts.
Free boosts.
Sit down.
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Well, it's not like I had any choice.
All your phone calls and e-mails.
I had to block you from my Buddy List you were so incessant.
- Blocked me?
I thought you were off-line.
You want something?
- The Razzmatazz is...
- Luke I told you, I'm not staying.
So tell me, what is it that's so important?
If you drink it too fast, you can get a brain freeze.
- So sip it slowly.
- That's good advice.
Okay, guys, I can drink a cold beverage.
I'm telling you, I'm really so not okay.
I guess we'll skip the Razzmatazz.
Hey.
Sorry.
I'm surprised that hasn't happened before.
I'm not saying I'm disappointed it hasn't happened before.
- I'm saying the mathematical probability...
- Crying during chick flicks.
- Walking in on me getting dressed.
- What's your point?
I'm not seeing what you're getting at.
- Do you work out?
- Not really.
Me neither.
I'm gonna go watch some hockey.
- Hockey season's over.
- Damn it.
- Where you going?
- To find Luke.
Beat the crap out of him.
- Where'll the can of whup-ass be opened?
- I'll go to his house, check the pier.
Have you considered our back yard?
- What's up, guys?
- Why don't you tell me?
- Calm down.
I didn't come to fight.
- You told me it was over.
It is.
Believe me.
I just...
I had to talk to her.
Next time you wanna talk to somebody, talk to Seth, me.
Anyone but her.
No one will talk to me.
Sleeping with your ex-girlfriend's mom kind of yields that result.
- I thought you were my friends.
- You got no friends.
I know.
- But I need your help.
- I'm not gonna help you.
- I'm leaving.
- Thanks for stopping by.
No, I mean, I'm leaving town.
Now that the divorce is final, my dad just wants to get out, so...
- We got family in Portland.
- You're going with him?
Don't tell anybody.
But that's what I was trying to tell Julie.
And that's what I wanna tell Marissa.
But I wanna tell her myself.
- Look, I don't know, Luke.
- Come on.
Please, please.
Five minutes.
It's not that much to ask, to say goodbye.
Then I'm gone.
Please.
- You okay?
- Yeah, just checking the paper for any impending natural disasters before tomorrow's grand opening.
- You're not nervous, are you?
- No, why be nervous?
If our pre-celebration tonight goes badly there'll be no time to fix it before tomorrow night.
I like to anticipate the worst at all times.
It's a Cohen family trait.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Yes!
- What is that?
- We're business partners.
- We needed our own secret handshake.
- Secret handshake?
- It's a guy thing.
- You couldn't possibly understand.
- Is this okay?
Or is it putting the "ho" in hostess?
Hailey, it looks great.
But it's not my restaurant.
Jimmy?
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, I mean we should ask Sandy because...
- I don't have shoes.
It'll serve to distract the customers, which is good, since they won't be drinking.
The Liquor Board is reneging on our liquor license.
- They can't.
They gave us a permit.
- Must be a mix-up.
I'll call the inspector.
See, that's why we Cohens are always right.
Because the worst always happens.
Come on, Hail.
I'll go get your shoes.
So you like the dress?
It's definitely a keeper.
So you'd sit in my section?
How do you even make waitress-speak sound so...?
Dirty?
I was gonna say "untoward," but, yeah.
Hail, it's your feet, not mine.
Can you believe this?
Okay, Coop.
So what's it gonna be, a little salt glow?
Little Tahitian body wrap?
Or maybe a lotion boot?
Okay, not really into exfoliating right now.
Besides, I promised Ryan I'd meet him for lunch at the pier.
Lunch at the pier.
Corn dogs and pizza.
You know, I read an article in Stuff.
It says carbs send endorphins to your brain and that makes you happy.
Oh, that's probably Ryan.
I gotta go grab it.
Where'd you leave your phone?
Your dad's room?
No, my room.
You have a room?
Wait.
Hello?
Yeah, Coop.
Like what you've done with the place.
Yeah, I guess I didn't really get around to unpacking.
How can you live like this?
Your T-shirts touch your sweaters.
I figured that if I didn't hang anything up then it wouldn't be so permanent.
Anyway, I gotta go meet Ryan.
So do you wanna come or...?
You know what?
Do you mind if I hang out here and watch TV?
The step-monster got her wisdom teeth pulled.
She's whacked out on Percocet leaving drool all over the house.
- Okay, sure.
Go ahead.
I'll see you later.
- I can't believe they're seeing each other.
- They're not.
- That's not what it looked like last night.
- Last night wasn't what it looked like.
I talked to Luke.
What?
You guys are still hanging out?
No, he showed up.
He wants to talk to you.
Apologize.
No.
There's no way I could forgive him.
- Maybe for Holly.
But not for this.
- I know but it would mean a lot to him.
What's important to him is really not so important to me.
That's a whole part of my life I'd just rather keep separate from this part of my life.
You know what we haven't done in a while?
Listen, I'm all for getting it on in exotic locales.
But I think your best friend's bedroom's just really disheveled.
Wow.
I like what she's done with the place.
The cardboard boxes, it feels very...
I'm getting like a garage-sale vibe.
Yes, I know.
See, they say your external life influences your internal life.
- Who says that?
- I read it in ELLE Decor.
- Your favorite magazine.
- You read?
No wonder she's so depressed.
We need to surprise her and fix it up.
Do you think giving her a little feng shui will help her forget her mom slept with her ex-boyfriend?
- It can't hurt.
Right.
Well, that's very sweet.
But if you put a mirror on that wall, it'd open up the energy flow in this room.
- I know where you're going with this.
- The hardware store.
The hardware store?
With, like, the bolts and the grouting and the Skil saws?
You don't like hardware stores and you cry during chick flicks.
Next thing you're gonna tell me, you walk in on Ryan changing.
Come on.
That's crazy.
Hey, let's go to the hardware store.
Peter Johnson, from the Liquor Board.
Am I right?
You came here about a month ago and granted us a liquor license.
Craziest thing.
I open my mail, and I read that our liquor license had been reneged.
Yes.
- Yeah, crazy?
- Yes, your license has been reneged.
Without a liquor license, this place can't turn a profit.
This is Newport Beach.
Everyone's a borderline alcoholic.
I'm sorry, but your temporary license was issued before your file landed in front of the newly appointed commissioner.
- So?
- The name Steve Peiser mean anything?
No.
Well, it might to Jimmy Cooper.
Turns out Mr. Cooper was Commissioner Peiser's financial advisor before he stole a quarter of a million dollars from him.
You're kidding me.
It was that financial loss that forced my boss out of retirement and back to work.
He saw Cooper's name on the file and said "no way."
Want my advice?
Have Mr. Cooper step down.
So, what do you wanna do for lunch?
I can do mac and cheese or mac and cheese.
Tough choice.
- I forgot how fun this was.
- Pretty fun.
You know, lunch could wait.
We are having a pretty big dinner.
- Not your dad, is it?
- No, he has a key.
- Mr. Nichol.
- Call me Caleb.
I'm not disturbing you, am I?
No.
Yeah, come in.
- Ryan.
- Mr. Nichol.
Would you mind if Marissa and I had a word, privately?
- Sure.
- Actually, Ryan and I don't have secrets.
It's important.
Well, then I definitely want him here.
What follows doesn't leave this room then, okay?
Sit down.
Marissa, your mother's a wonderful woman.
She is?
You're important to her.
You and I haven't spent a lot of time together but it was important to me to come and get your blessing.
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
- You wanna marry my mom?
- I love her very much.
- You don't know her.
- You should give Marissa some time.
- This is kind of a big deal.
- Impossible.
I intend to propose to her tonight at the restaurant with our friends and family in attendance.
Well, then I guess I can't stop you.
I'll see you both tonight.
Thanks for your time, dear.
And again, this is just between us.
I want it to be a surprise.
If my mom marries him, she's gonna be the most powerful woman in Newport.
Not if you tell Caleb the truth.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Did you talk to her?
- I tried.
- And?
- I don't think it's gonna happen, man.
- What do you mean?
- She's dealing with a lot of stuff now.
- Family stuff.
- She won't even see me for 30 seconds?
Her dad's restaurant's having its private opening tonight.
She's busy.
- I'm leaving town.
- She doesn't know.
- That's because she won't talk to me.
- Why don't you just write her a letter?
Write her a letter?
- I had your back with Oliver.
- You had sex with her mom.
I didn't just have sex with her, okay?
!
I'm in love with her!
- I was...
I am in love!
- Don't need to hear it.
But Marissa does.
I have to talk to her.
I have to explain.
- Luke, I wouldn't.
- I can't go without making it right.
I won't.
Okay, the plan is, we go to dinner for, like, 10 minutes, right?
Then we sneak out, come back here and make magic happen.
Excellent.
I'm extremely stealth.
1996, All-School Hide-and-Seek champion.
I do believe Joel Gordon is still looking for me.
The fool.
Hey!
Last year's yearbook.
- God, I love yearbooks.
- Listen, let's put it away because we've got a lot of work to do.
- Stop it!
- Let's just put it back.
Hey, it's you.
- We had a sailing team?
- Yeah.
It never got off the ground, but...
- You were in the Comic Book Club?
- I was the president and only member.
Let's see.
- We had a Film Preservation Society?
- Yeah, but it was a long time ago.
So you know, we don't have to...
It's not fun.
Was I really mean to you?
No.
That would have required you to speak to me.
Or anyone to speak to me.
A lot's changed in a year, huh?
Hey.
"Marissa, you're the greatest.
This summer will rock.
- Love you forever, Luke."
- Yeah.
A lot's definitely changed.
Marissa's gonna need a whole lot of feng shui.
Hey.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
You look sad.
I thought this would be a moment to celebrate.
So did I.
You know that mix-up with the liquor license?
- It's not such a mix-up.
- You're kidding.
It turns out the new commissioner is a former client of Jimmy's with a quarter-million dollar score to settle.
Without that license, there's no point opening.
I've been on the phone trying to call in favors.
I got nothing.
The guy is serious.
The only way he'll reconsider is if Jimmy steps down.
Leaves the business.
- You're not considering...
- No, of course not.
Well, there is one last option.
You're not gonna like it.
My dad can be very...
He can be very persuasive.
I may have to throw a few more of these back before you start bringing up Caleb.
Desperate times.
This is that.
Hey, man.
What's going on?
- Where you been?
- What?
- What?
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
Not one thing, okay?
- All right.
I'm gonna go pee, okay?
So if anyone asks, that's where I am.
For a while.
Right.
- He's getting weirder.
- Didn't think that was possible.
Marissa.
Mom.
That's the warmest conversation I've had with her in weeks.
I'll have a word, see if I can't help.
I have been known to be quite persuasive.
So I've heard.
What's with Dad these days?
He's all warm and mushy.
Don't know.
Maybe it's the new blood-thinning medication he's on.
What about you?
How's your romantic life?
Oh, you know me.
Not much.
Vince, thank you so much.
How excited is Jimmy?
He's like a totally different person.
It's so great.
Let's hope tomorrow night goes as well as tonight.
- Pat.
Thanks for coming by.
- My pleasure.
Though I gotta say, Nana Cohen's meat loaf, trouncing Grandma Cooper's.
- She would expect no less.
- How'd it go today with the Liquor Board?
- All sorted out?
- Working on it.
Working on it.
Enjoy it, Jimmy.
Moments like this don't happen every day.
I know.
It's fantastic.
- Hey.
- How you doing?
I'm just happy you're here, so I don't have to do this alone.
You know me.
Can't get enough of this stuff.
Excuse me, everyone.
I have something I'd like to say.
I hope you're all enjoying yourselves tonight as much as I am.
Though my enjoyment of life over the last few months goes beyond this restaurant to a very special lady, Julie Cooper.
What's he doing here?
Julie did a fantastic job on the d Ácor, didn't she?
Hey, come on, let's go.
And...
- It's here on this opening night...
- Nobody'll talk to me or even look at me.
- Had a little bit to drink?
- I'd like to show her how special she is.
I gotta tell Marissa it wasn't just sex.
I love her mom.
Okay, I don't think that's a good idea.
Julie Cooper will you marry me?
Oh, my God!
Yes, of course I will, Cal.
Kiki!
Luke.
Hey.
Luke.
Hey!
- Look, Luke...
- Don't make me!
Just give me your keys.
Let me drive you home.
What home?
I can't believe he just showed up here.
- I need your car.
I need to go after him.
- No.
It's like you're saying he did nothing wrong.
I'm not taking his side.
I'm not taking any side.
You know what?
Maybe you should.
He should have time alone to think about what he did.
- Feel bad about it.
- He does feel bad...
- That's why he's leaving.
- What are you talking about?
His dad's moving to Portland.
He's moving with him.
Because of what happened.
Can I have your keys?
He's had a lot to drink.
- That's cool.
I didn't want any, anyway.
- My dad is marrying Julie Cooper.
Julie Cooper is my stepmom.
- Maybe we'll get you another bottle.
- Drink up.
This is an unholy alliance, two storm fronts colliding.
It's the apocalypse for us.
- Maybe you wanna lay off the sauce.
- Think of it.
All the time we were growing up and you'd come over for dinner you'd go sailing with my dad, did you ever think he would marry your ex-wife?
- Yeah, give me a glass.
- Never.
Jimbo, the way I see it, this might be the best thing that could happen to you.
There is nothing good about it.
This marriage is an asteroid that hit the Earth.
Now we have to see what species survives.
I did it.
Look.
Wow, you hit a nail!
Bob Vila's your bitch, Cohen.
What?
!
Why?
!
- This is not supposed to happen.
- You have to find the stud.
- You mean like you did, Summer?
- Just get me the stud finder.
Oh, Summer, I think you are the stud finder.
- See this hammer in my hand?
- What does the stud finder look like?
- And the level.
- What is a level?
- Don't you know what a level is?
- What you advance to in a video game.
That's funny.
Yeah.
The tool doesn't know about tools.
My people, we don't really build.
We're not what you would call "handy."
We hire people to do it.
Why don't we just get a contractor?
Or I can paint.
And here I thought you could only paint the ceiling.
Marissa, hey, listen, I...
No, no.
It's me, man.
- I'm fine, man.
- You don't sound fine.
Well, you know, I'm just having a few beers up at the park rocking out to Seger.
You know the drill.
Not really.
Hey, do me a favor, Ryan.
Tell Marissa I get it.
Okay?
I don 't deserve her forgiveness.
I'm...
I'm scum.
I'm...
All I ever did was let her down.
Tell her that.
No, just tell me where you are, all right?
You can't leave without saying goodbye, right?
Right.
Goodbye.
Damn it!
I'm not here.
Leave a message.
Julie.
I'm...
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I need to see you.
I'm coming...
I'm coming to see you.
You owe me a goodbye!
Without a liquor license, we'll be belly-up in no time.
- Really?
Cal, I had no idea.
- There's no point in opening the place.
That's why I was hoping I could ask you to do me a favor.
- What?
- Wait, did you not hear me?
I just wanted to hear you say it again.
If it was up to me, I'd rather take the hit than talk with you.
But it's Jimmy.
- The Lighthouse is all he's got.
- Lf you drop him, they'd issue the license.
But you're too much of a martyr.
Listen, Sanford never mix business with friendship.
- You're right.
From now on, I'm doing all my deals with you.
When you came to me about Uncle Shaun, I said yes.
You owe me.
I don't wanna owe you.
I wanna hold it over your head.
Need water.
Tried to lie down, got the spins.
Well, I better get back to my bride-to-be.
Oh, yeah.
Definitely might vomit.
Luke, call us when you get this.
Ryan.
When I saw him at the party last night I wished for something like this to happen.
It's not your fault.
- How is he?
- Well, he's out of surgery.
He's pretty much out of commission right now, but the worst is behind him.
I should call my parents.
You guys he's gonna be asleep for a while.
You should go home.
- Maybe we should, so we could finish.
- Or we could sleep.
You know, I'm really glad that Luke's gonna be okay.
We'll come back.
Actually, I'm gonna stay.
You know, just in case.
Okay.
Then I'll stay too.
I heard he'd been drinking which makes one less inspired to go after our liquor license.
- Can I get you something to eat?
- No, no, I'm good.
Don't worry about going to city hall.
I'll deal with them.
You hold down the fort.
That's not necessary.
You hang at the Lighthouse.
Man the ship.
Are we gonna refer to the restaurant as a ship or a fort?
Well, right now it's a sinking ship.
Okay, not the most inspiring metaphor on our opening night.
Why don't you sit down?
I can't.
I gotta go see what the holdup is with the liquor license.
You're the holdup, Jimmy.
Does the name Steve Peiser mean anything to you?
When he went back to work, after his financial advisor lost his life savings he got a job as commissioner of the Liquor Board.
This restaurant was supposed to be a chance for me to escape from my past.
I guess there is no escaping, huh?
Well, we do have one possible Houdini-esque escape left.
Caleb.
I asked him for help.
- You hate asking him for help.
- This was no exception.
I had no choice.
You did.
You could've told me the truth and asked me to bow out.
Like I said, I had no choice.
Satellite Pharmacy to room 607.
Satellite Pharmacy, room 607.
Hey, guys.
He's up.
You should go home.
And thanks for waiting, all right?
Wait.
Will you tell him that I'm here and I'd like to see him?
I'll start auditioning bands right away.
I need to start soliciting recommendations for the videographer and the photographer, the engravers.
You know, I should ask Diane Kahn.
She's been married, like, at least a half a dozen times.
Why aren't you more excited?
Oh, Julie, it was a rough night.
Hey, where are you going?
Why aren't you asleep?
Because Summer's a slave driver.
Is Ryan back from the hospital yet?
- Hospital?
- Oh, didn't you hear?
Luke wrapped his truck around a telephone pole last night.
- He did?
- Just a few blocks from here.
He was drinking.
So unlike him.
Well, I guess he just never really recovered from everything with his father.
You know, the humiliation, his family being torn apart.
Yeah, that must be it.
Pour me a bloody mary, will you, James?
Since it'll be the last drink we serve.
- What?
That's it?
- Hook, line and sinker.
No license.
No opening.
No restaurant.
- No comeback.
- That's the best you could do?
- As big a badass as you are?
- Didn't have an effect on this Peiser fella.
You know how to piss people off.
You could teach me a thing or two.
- You seem awfully glib.
- Everything happens for a reason.
Could you at least feign a little sensitivity at our misfortune?
You know what they say:
One man's misfortune is another man's fortune.
- Who says that?
- I do.
- I've never seen him smile.
- I didn't know he had teeth.
Make yourselves a couple of drinks, fellas.
We should talk.
Cheers.
Are you okay?
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean for this to happen.
Any of it.
I just...
I didn't have anyone.
I had no one.
Not my family.
I don't know, you know?
But I'm gonna go away.
Give things a chance to go back to normal for you.
Because I know as long as I'm here, they won't.
But I need to know one thing before I go.
Can you forgive me?
Yeah.
Yes.
Luke I'll miss you.
Who would've thought when you moved to town that I'd be the one who had to leave?
I thought I was gonna live in Newport my whole life.
So you'll start a new life.
Yeah, maybe I'll show up in Portland and fall for the chick dating the captain of the football team.
And he can kick your ass.
Yeah.
Welcome to Portland, bitch.
Well, I'll e-mail you.
Maybe I'll drop back in say hey.
Good luck, man.
Want me to take you home?
I hate her so much.
I mean, she tried to drive you out.
She almost destroyed my dad.
She nearly killed Luke.
I have to do something.
Okay.
So where we going?
Marissa.
Hello.
Come in.
Is everything all right?
Actually, no, it's not.
We need to talk about my mom.
I was just thinking the same thing.
Sit down, please.
I know things between you and your mom have been rocky this year.
- Can you both put the past behind you?
- You have no idea what she's like or what she's done.
- I know.
I know.
Everything.
We should use this occasion as a chance to heal.
Make a fresh start.
Family is very important to me, Marissa.
I want us all to be a real family.
- Your sister deserves that, so do you.
- We already have a dad.
I'm well aware.
I'm not trying to replace him, push him out.
Quite the opposite, in fact.
As of today I'm the only chance your father has.
- What are you talking about?
This morning I offered to buy the Balboa Lighthouse from both he and Sandy for several million dollars.
Considering the fact that the restaurant will never open, make a cent I'd say it was a pretty good deal.
However, if I were to change my mind decide it was a bad investment, lose my checkbook your father would be ruined.
Penniless.
Run out of town.
Which is where I come in.
You are very important to your mother.
She is very important to me.
- Be part of our family.
- Which means what, exactly?
Well, you're already part of the wedding.
When your mom moves in you come and live with us too.
- You're joking, right?
It would mean everything to her.
And if I do this, then you'll definitely buy the restaurant?
This conversation would have to remain confidential.
You wouldn't want my mom to know you blackmailed me into living with her?
So do we have a deal?
Wonderful.
Now, was there something else that you wanted to ask me about?
- You okay?
- I'm a prisoner in my own life.
I'm great.
- Well, you did what you needed to do.
- Yeah.
- I guess I just need some sleep.
- Yeah, okay.
I'll call you...
I told you, no touching anything, ever.
- You're such a dandy, Cohen.
- You're a dandy, woman.
- Fine, take it.
- No.
I don't want it.
Oh, my God!
Those are tears of joy, yes?
I...
I don't even know what to say.
Summer did all the building.
And the heavy lifting.
And the wiring of the electronics.
But I painted.
I know you're a Paris fan.
It's amazing.
This is so cool.
We looked through your toys and couldn't find any plastic horses but we did find this.
Share Bear!
Wow!
Yeah, she'll watch over you with her Care Bear stare.
How do you know about the Care Bear stare?
- I painted that.
- Yes, you did.
I did.
Thanks, you guys.
- I really needed this.
- Yeah, it was nothing.
For you.
You should see Cohen with a power saw.
How do you know about the Care Bear stare?
- Dude, leave it alone.
- No, I'm just curious.
- Isn't he cute?
- It's like...
It's kind of...
- Previously on The O.C.:
- What about that date?
- You're breaking up with me?
- It never could work.
- Cal, when you wanna date, let me know.
- It was an accident.
You accidentally slept with Marissa's mom or accidentally told Marissa?
- I just...
- Get out of here, Luke.
- I don't wanna see him again.
- What about your dad?
Kaitlin?
What am I supposed to do without you?
You are not leaving this house.
Or what?
You're gonna call the police or Dr. Milano?
You know what?
Go ahead.
In fact, why don't you call up Dad and Caleb?
I'd really love to tell them why I ran away.
You okay?
Yeah, it's just really sad.
It's just the movie, right?
That's the reason for the tears?
Yes.
I'm emotionally stable.
Besides, I'm not the only one crying.
I'm sorry, what?
I'm allergic, okay?
And there's so much pollen in here right now.
It's ridiculous.
- Tomorrow we're watching football, okay?
- Football season is five months away.
ESPN Classics, okay?
We'll watch old games.
Maybe next time we should see a comedy.
What?
No, no.
I can see sad movies.
Yeah.
No, I know you can.
I can't, Ryan, I'm sensitive.
- Okay, so, what now?
- Whatever Coop wants to do.
- Yeah, what do you wanna to do?
- I don't know.
It's getting late.
- So you wanna go back?
- Why don't we have a slumber party.
- I'll stay over.
- We all will.
We'll sleep in shifts.
- That way, one of us'll be up at all times.
- Doing what?
Hey, whatever you need us to do.
- Look, okay?
Guys, I'm fine.
- Yeah, yeah.
We know.
Why wouldn't you be?
I don't know, because the guy I lost my virginity to had sex with my mom.
- Oh, yeah, I remember that.
- Look, guys, it's really not that big a deal.
- Why don't we go to Jamba Juice?
- That's a great idea.
I love juice.
- Remember that thing with vitamin C?
- The boosts.
Free boosts.
Sit down.
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Well, it's not like I had any choice.
All your phone calls and e-mails.
I had to block you from my Buddy List you were so incessant.
- Blocked me?
I thought you were off-line.
You want something?
- The Razzmatazz is...
- Luke I told you, I'm not staying.
So tell me, what is it that's so important?
If you drink it too fast, you can get a brain freeze.
- So sip it slowly.
- That's good advice.
Okay, guys, I can drink a cold beverage.
I'm telling you, I'm really so not okay.
I guess we'll skip the Razzmatazz.
Hey.
Sorry.
I'm surprised that hasn't happened before.
I'm not saying I'm disappointed it hasn't happened before.
- I'm saying the mathematical probability...
- Crying during chick flicks.
- Walking in on me getting dressed.
- What's your point?
I'm not seeing what you're getting at.
- Do you work out?
- Not really.
Me neither.
I'm gonna go watch some hockey.
- Hockey season's over.
- Damn it.
- Where you going?
- To find Luke.
Beat the crap out of him.
- Where'll the can of whup-ass be opened?
- I'll go to his house, check the pier.
Have you considered our back yard?
- What's up, guys?
- Why don't you tell me?
- Calm down.
I didn't come to fight.
- You told me it was over.
It is.
Believe me.
I just...
I had to talk to her.
Next time you wanna talk to somebody, talk to Seth, me.
Anyone but her.
No one will talk to me.
Sleeping with your ex-girlfriend's mom kind of yields that result.
- I thought you were my friends.
- You got no friends.
I know.
- But I need your help.
- I'm not gonna help you.
- I'm leaving.
- Thanks for stopping by.
No, I mean, I'm leaving town.
Now that the divorce is final, my dad just wants to get out, so...
- We got family in Portland.
- You're going with him?
Don't tell anybody.
But that's what I was trying to tell Julie.
And that's what I wanna tell Marissa.
But I wanna tell her myself.
- Look, I don't know, Luke.
- Come on.
Please, please.
Five minutes.
It's not that much to ask, to say goodbye.
Then I'm gone.
Please.
- You okay?
- Yeah, just checking the paper for any impending natural disasters before tomorrow's grand opening.
- You're not nervous, are you?
- No, why be nervous?
If our pre-celebration tonight goes badly there'll be no time to fix it before tomorrow night.
I like to anticipate the worst at all times.
It's a Cohen family trait.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Yes!
- What is that?
- We're business partners.
- We needed our own secret handshake.
- Secret handshake?
- It's a guy thing.
- You couldn't possibly understand.
- Is this okay?
Or is it putting the "ho" in hostess?
Hailey, it looks great.
But it's not my restaurant.
Jimmy?
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, I mean we should ask Sandy because...
- I don't have shoes.
It'll serve to distract the customers, which is good, since they won't be drinking.
The Liquor Board is reneging on our liquor license.
- They can't.
They gave us a permit.
- Must be a mix-up.
I'll call the inspector.
See, that's why we Cohens are always right.
Because the worst always happens.
Come on, Hail.
I'll go get your shoes.
So you like the dress?
It's definitely a keeper.
So you'd sit in my section?
How do you even make waitress-speak sound so...?
Dirty?
I was gonna say "untoward," but, yeah.
Hail, it's your feet, not mine.
Can you believe this?
Okay, Coop.
So what's it gonna be, a little salt glow?
Little Tahitian body wrap?
Or maybe a lotion boot?
Okay, not really into exfoliating right now.
Besides, I promised Ryan I'd meet him for lunch at the pier.
Lunch at the pier.
Corn dogs and pizza.
You know, I read an article in Stuff.
It says carbs send endorphins to your brain and that makes you happy.
Oh, that's probably Ryan.
I gotta go grab it.
Where'd you leave your phone?
Your dad's room?
No, my room.
You have a room?
Wait.
Hello?
Yeah, Coop.
Like what you've done with the place.
Yeah, I guess I didn't really get around to unpacking.
How can you live like this?
Your T-shirts touch your sweaters.
I figured that if I didn't hang anything up then it wouldn't be so permanent.
Anyway, I gotta go meet Ryan.
So do you wanna come or...?
You know what?
Do you mind if I hang out here and watch TV?
The step-monster got her wisdom teeth pulled.
She's whacked out on Percocet leaving drool all over the house.
- Okay, sure.
Go ahead.
I'll see you later.
- I can't believe they're seeing each other.
- They're not.
- That's not what it looked like last night.
- Last night wasn't what it looked like.
I talked to Luke.
What?
You guys are still hanging out?
No, he showed up.
He wants to talk to you.
Apologize.
No.
There's no way I could forgive him.
- Maybe for Holly.
But not for this.
- I know but it would mean a lot to him.
What's important to him is really not so important to me.
That's a whole part of my life I'd just rather keep separate from this part of my life.
You know what we haven't done in a while?
Listen, I'm all for getting it on in exotic locales.
But I think your best friend's bedroom's just really disheveled.
Wow.
I like what she's done with the place.
The cardboard boxes, it feels very...
I'm getting like a garage-sale vibe.
Yes, I know.
See, they say your external life influences your internal life.
- Who says that?
- I read it in ELLE Decor.
- Your favorite magazine.
- You read?
No wonder she's so depressed.
We need to surprise her and fix it up.
Do you think giving her a little feng shui will help her forget her mom slept with her ex-boyfriend?
- It can't hurt.
Right.
Well, that's very sweet.
But if you put a mirror on that wall, it'd open up the energy flow in this room.
- I know where you're going with this.
- The hardware store.
The hardware store?
With, like, the bolts and the grouting and the Skil saws?
You don't like hardware stores and you cry during chick flicks.
Next thing you're gonna tell me, you walk in on Ryan changing.
Come on.
That's crazy.
Hey, let's go to the hardware store.
Peter Johnson, from the Liquor Board.
Am I right?
You came here about a month ago and granted us a liquor license.
Craziest thing.
I open my mail, and I read that our liquor license had been reneged.
Yes.
- Yeah, crazy?
- Yes, your license has been reneged.
Without a liquor license, this place can't turn a profit.
This is Newport Beach.
Everyone's a borderline alcoholic.
I'm sorry, but your temporary license was issued before your file landed in front of the newly appointed commissioner.
- So?
- The name Steve Peiser mean anything?
No.
Well, it might to Jimmy Cooper.
Turns out Mr. Cooper was Commissioner Peiser's financial advisor before he stole a quarter of a million dollars from him.
You're kidding me.
It was that financial loss that forced my boss out of retirement and back to work.
He saw Cooper's name on the file and said "no way."
Want my advice?
Have Mr. Cooper step down.
So, what do you wanna do for lunch?
I can do mac and cheese or mac and cheese.
Tough choice.
- I forgot how fun this was.
- Pretty fun.
You know, lunch could wait.
We are having a pretty big dinner.
- Not your dad, is it?
- No, he has a key.
- Mr. Nichol.
- Call me Caleb.
I'm not disturbing you, am I?
No.
Yeah, come in.
- Ryan.
- Mr. Nichol.
Would you mind if Marissa and I had a word, privately?
- Sure.
- Actually, Ryan and I don't have secrets.
It's important.
Well, then I definitely want him here.
What follows doesn't leave this room then, okay?
Sit down.
Marissa, your mother's a wonderful woman.
She is?
You're important to her.
You and I haven't spent a lot of time together but it was important to me to come and get your blessing.
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
- You wanna marry my mom?
- I love her very much.
- You don't know her.
- You should give Marissa some time.
- This is kind of a big deal.
- Impossible.
I intend to propose to her tonight at the restaurant with our friends and family in attendance.
Well, then I guess I can't stop you.
I'll see you both tonight.
Thanks for your time, dear.
And again, this is just between us.
I want it to be a surprise.
If my mom marries him, she's gonna be the most powerful woman in Newport.
Not if you tell Caleb the truth.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Did you talk to her?
- I tried.
- And?
- I don't think it's gonna happen, man.
- What do you mean?
- She's dealing with a lot of stuff now.
- Family stuff.
- She won't even see me for 30 seconds?
Her dad's restaurant's having its private opening tonight.
She's busy.
- I'm leaving town.
- She doesn't know.
- That's because she won't talk to me.
- Why don't you just write her a letter?
Write her a letter?
- I had your back with Oliver.
- You had sex with her mom.
I didn't just have sex with her, okay?
!
I'm in love with her!
- I was...
I am in love!
- Don't need to hear it.
But Marissa does.
I have to talk to her.
I have to explain.
- Luke, I wouldn't.
- I can't go without making it right.
I won't.
Okay, the plan is, we go to dinner for, like, 10 minutes, right?
Then we sneak out, come back here and make magic happen.
Excellent.
I'm extremely stealth.
1996, All-School Hide-and-Seek champion.
I do believe Joel Gordon is still looking for me.
The fool.
Hey!
Last year's yearbook.
- God, I love yearbooks.
- Listen, let's put it away because we've got a lot of work to do.
- Stop it!
- Let's just put it back.
Hey, it's you.
- We had a sailing team?
- Yeah.
It never got off the ground, but...
- You were in the Comic Book Club?
- I was the president and only member.
Let's see.
- We had a Film Preservation Society?
- Yeah, but it was a long time ago.
So you know, we don't have to...
It's not fun.
Was I really mean to you?
No.
That would have required you to speak to me.
Or anyone to speak to me.
A lot's changed in a year, huh?
Hey.
"Marissa, you're the greatest.
This summer will rock.
- Love you forever, Luke."
- Yeah.
A lot's definitely changed.
Marissa's gonna need a whole lot of feng shui.
Hey.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
You look sad.
I thought this would be a moment to celebrate.
So did I.
You know that mix-up with the liquor license?
- It's not such a mix-up.
- You're kidding.
It turns out the new commissioner is a former client of Jimmy's with a quarter-million dollar score to settle.
Without that license, there's no point opening.
I've been on the phone trying to call in favors.
I got nothing.
The guy is serious.
The only way he'll reconsider is if Jimmy steps down.
Leaves the business.
- You're not considering...
- No, of course not.
Well, there is one last option.
You're not gonna like it.
My dad can be very...
He can be very persuasive.
I may have to throw a few more of these back before you start bringing up Caleb.
Desperate times.
This is that.
Hey, man.
What's going on?
- Where you been?
- What?
- What?
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
Not one thing, okay?
- All right.
I'm gonna go pee, okay?
So if anyone asks, that's where I am.
For a while.
Right.
- He's getting weirder.
- Didn't think that was possible.
Marissa.
Mom.
That's the warmest conversation I've had with her in weeks.
I'll have a word, see if I can't help.
I have been known to be quite persuasive.
So I've heard.
What's with Dad these days?
He's all warm and mushy.
Don't know.
Maybe it's the new blood-thinning medication he's on.
What about you?
How's your romantic life?
Oh, you know me.
Not much.
Vince, thank you so much.
How excited is Jimmy?
He's like a totally different person.
It's so great.
Let's hope tomorrow night goes as well as tonight.
- Pat.
Thanks for coming by.
- My pleasure.
Though I gotta say, Nana Cohen's meat loaf, trouncing Grandma Cooper's.
- She would expect no less.
- How'd it go today with the Liquor Board?
- All sorted out?
- Working on it.
Working on it.
Enjoy it, Jimmy.
Moments like this don't happen every day.
I know.
It's fantastic.
- Hey.
- How you doing?
I'm just happy you're here, so I don't have to do this alone.
You know me.
Can't get enough of this stuff.
Excuse me, everyone.
I have something I'd like to say.
I hope you're all enjoying yourselves tonight as much as I am.
Though my enjoyment of life over the last few months goes beyond this restaurant to a very special lady, Julie Cooper.
What's he doing here?
Julie did a fantastic job on the d Ácor, didn't she?
Hey, come on, let's go.
And...
- It's here on this opening night...
- Nobody'll talk to me or even look at me.
- Had a little bit to drink?
- I'd like to show her how special she is.
I gotta tell Marissa it wasn't just sex.
I love her mom.
Okay, I don't think that's a good idea.
Julie Cooper will you marry me?
Oh, my God!
Yes, of course I will, Cal.
Kiki!
Luke.
Hey.
Luke.
Hey!
- Look, Luke...
- Don't make me!
Just give me your keys.
Let me drive you home.
What home?
I can't believe he just showed up here.
- I need your car.
I need to go after him.
- No.
It's like you're saying he did nothing wrong.
I'm not taking his side.
I'm not taking any side.
You know what?
Maybe you should.
He should have time alone to think about what he did.
- Feel bad about it.
- He does feel bad...
- That's why he's leaving.
- What are you talking about?
His dad's moving to Portland.
He's moving with him.
Because of what happened.
Can I have your keys?
He's had a lot to drink.
- That's cool.
I didn't want any, anyway.
- My dad is marrying Julie Cooper.
Julie Cooper is my stepmom.
- Maybe we'll get you another bottle.
- Drink up.
This is an unholy alliance, two storm fronts colliding.
It's the apocalypse for us.
- Maybe you wanna lay off the sauce.
- Think of it.
All the time we were growing up and you'd come over for dinner you'd go sailing with my dad, did you ever think he would marry your ex-wife?
- Yeah, give me a glass.
- Never.
Jimbo, the way I see it, this might be the best thing that could happen to you.
There is nothing good about it.
This marriage is an asteroid that hit the Earth.
Now we have to see what species survives.
I did it.
Look.
Wow, you hit a nail!
Bob Vila's your bitch, Cohen.
What?
!
Why?
!
- This is not supposed to happen.
- You have to find the stud.
- You mean like you did, Summer?
- Just get me the stud finder.
Oh, Summer, I think you are the stud finder.
- See this hammer in my hand?
- What does the stud finder look like?
- And the level.
- What is a level?
- Don't you know what a level is?
- What you advance to in a video game.
That's funny.
Yeah.
The tool doesn't know about tools.
My people, we don't really build.
We're not what you would call "handy."
We hire people to do it.
Why don't we just get a contractor?
Or I can paint.
And here I thought you could only paint the ceiling.
Marissa, hey, listen, I...
No, no.
It's me, man.
- I'm fine, man.
- You don't sound fine.
Well, you know, I'm just having a few beers up at the park rocking out to Seger.
You know the drill.
Not really.
Hey, do me a favor, Ryan.
Tell Marissa I get it.
Okay?
I don 't deserve her forgiveness.
I'm...
I'm scum.
I'm...
All I ever did was let her down.
Tell her that.
No, just tell me where you are, all right?
You can't leave without saying goodbye, right?
Right.
Goodbye.
Damn it!
I'm not here.
Leave a message.
Julie.
I'm...
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I need to see you.
I'm coming...
I'm coming to see you.
You owe me a goodbye!
Without a liquor license, we'll be belly-up in no time.
- Really?
Cal, I had no idea.
- There's no point in opening the place.
That's why I was hoping I could ask you to do me a favor.
- What?
- Wait, did you not hear me?
I just wanted to hear you say it again.
If it was up to me, I'd rather take the hit than talk with you.
But it's Jimmy.
- The Lighthouse is all he's got.
- Lf you drop him, they'd issue the license.
But you're too much of a martyr.
Listen, Sanford never mix business with friendship.
- You're right.
From now on, I'm doing all my deals with you.
When you came to me about Uncle Shaun, I said yes.
You owe me.
I don't wanna owe you.
I wanna hold it over your head.
Need water.
Tried to lie down, got the spins.
Well, I better get back to my bride-to-be.
Oh, yeah.
Definitely might vomit.
Luke, call us when you get this.
Ryan.
When I saw him at the party last night I wished for something like this to happen.
It's not your fault.
- How is he?
- Well, he's out of surgery.
He's pretty much out of commission right now, but the worst is behind him.
I should call my parents.
You guys he's gonna be asleep for a while.
You should go home.
- Maybe we should, so we could finish.
- Or we could sleep.
You know, I'm really glad that Luke's gonna be okay.
We'll come back.
Actually, I'm gonna stay.
You know, just in case.
Okay.
Then I'll stay too.
I heard he'd been drinking which makes one less inspired to go after our liquor license.
- Can I get you something to eat?
- No, no, I'm good.
Don't worry about going to city hall.
I'll deal with them.
You hold down the fort.
That's not necessary.
You hang at the Lighthouse.
Man the ship.
Are we gonna refer to the restaurant as a ship or a fort?
Well, right now it's a sinking ship.
Okay, not the most inspiring metaphor on our opening night.
Why don't you sit down?
I can't.
I gotta go see what the holdup is with the liquor license.
You're the holdup, Jimmy.
Does the name Steve Peiser mean anything to you?
When he went back to work, after his financial advisor lost his life savings he got a job as commissioner of the Liquor Board.
This restaurant was supposed to be a chance for me to escape from my past.
I guess there is no escaping, huh?
Well, we do have one possible Houdini-esque escape left.
Caleb.
I asked him for help.
- You hate asking him for help.
- This was no exception.
I had no choice.
You did.
You could've told me the truth and asked me to bow out.
Like I said, I had no choice.
Satellite Pharmacy to room 607.
Satellite Pharmacy, room 607.
Hey, guys.
He's up.
You should go home.
And thanks for waiting, all right?
Wait.
Will you tell him that I'm here and I'd like to see him?
I'll start auditioning bands right away.
I need to start soliciting recommendations for the videographer and the photographer, the engravers.
You know, I should ask Diane Kahn.
She's been married, like, at least a half a dozen times.
Why aren't you more excited?
Oh, Julie, it was a rough night.
Hey, where are you going?
Why aren't you asleep?
Because Summer's a slave driver.
Is Ryan back from the hospital yet?
- Hospital?
- Oh, didn't you hear?
Luke wrapped his truck around a telephone pole last night.
- He did?
- Just a few blocks from here.
He was drinking.
So unlike him.
Well, I guess he just never really recovered from everything with his father.
You know, the humiliation, his family being torn apart.
Yeah, that must be it.
Pour me a bloody mary, will you, James?
Since it'll be the last drink we serve.
- What?
That's it?
- Hook, line and sinker.
No license.
No opening.
No restaurant.
- No comeback.
- That's the best you could do?
- As big a badass as you are?
- Didn't have an effect on this Peiser fella.
You know how to piss people off.
You could teach me a thing or two.
- You seem awfully glib.
- Everything happens for a reason.
Could you at least feign a little sensitivity at our misfortune?
You know what they say:
One man's misfortune is another man's fortune.
- Who says that?
- I do.
- I've never seen him smile.
- I didn't know he had teeth.
Make yourselves a couple of drinks, fellas.
We should talk.
Cheers.
Are you okay?
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean for this to happen.
Any of it.
I just...
I didn't have anyone.
I had no one.
Not my family.
I don't know, you know?
But I'm gonna go away.
Give things a chance to go back to normal for you.
Because I know as long as I'm here, they won't.
But I need to know one thing before I go.
Can you forgive me?
Yeah.
Yes.
Luke I'll miss you.
Who would've thought when you moved to town that I'd be the one who had to leave?
I thought I was gonna live in Newport my whole life.
So you'll start a new life.
Yeah, maybe I'll show up in Portland and fall for the chick dating the captain of the football team.
And he can kick your ass.
Yeah.
Welcome to Portland, bitch.
Well, I'll e-mail you.
Maybe I'll drop back in say hey.
Good luck, man.
Want me to take you home?
I hate her so much.
I mean, she tried to drive you out.
She almost destroyed my dad.
She nearly killed Luke.
I have to do something.
Okay.
So where we going?
Marissa.
Hello.
Come in.
Is everything all right?
Actually, no, it's not.
We need to talk about my mom.
I was just thinking the same thing.
Sit down, please.
I know things between you and your mom have been rocky this year.
- Can you both put the past behind you?
- You have no idea what she's like or what she's done.
- I know.
I know.
Everything.
We should use this occasion as a chance to heal.
Make a fresh start.
Family is very important to me, Marissa.
I want us all to be a real family.
- Your sister deserves that, so do you.
- We already have a dad.
I'm well aware.
I'm not trying to replace him, push him out.
Quite the opposite, in fact.
As of today I'm the only chance your father has.
- What are you talking about?
This morning I offered to buy the Balboa Lighthouse from both he and Sandy for several million dollars.
Considering the fact that the restaurant will never open, make a cent I'd say it was a pretty good deal.
However, if I were to change my mind decide it was a bad investment, lose my checkbook your father would be ruined.
Penniless.
Run out of town.
Which is where I come in.
You are very important to your mother.
She is very important to me.
- Be part of our family.
- Which means what, exactly?
Well, you're already part of the wedding.
When your mom moves in you come and live with us too.
- You're joking, right?
It would mean everything to her.
And if I do this, then you'll definitely buy the restaurant?
This conversation would have to remain confidential.
You wouldn't want my mom to know you blackmailed me into living with her?
So do we have a deal?
Wonderful.
Now, was there something else that you wanted to ask me about?
- You okay?
- I'm a prisoner in my own life.
I'm great.
- Well, you did what you needed to do.
- Yeah.
- I guess I just need some sleep.
- Yeah, okay.
I'll call you...
I told you, no touching anything, ever.
- You're such a dandy, Cohen.
- You're a dandy, woman.
- Fine, take it.
- No.
I don't want it.
Oh, my God!
Those are tears of joy, yes?
I...
I don't even know what to say.
Summer did all the building.
And the heavy lifting.
And the wiring of the electronics.
But I painted.
I know you're a Paris fan.
It's amazing.
This is so cool.
We looked through your toys and couldn't find any plastic horses but we did find this.
Share Bear!
Wow!
Yeah, she'll watch over you with her Care Bear stare.
How do you know about the Care Bear stare?
- I painted that.
- Yes, you did.
I did.
Thanks, you guys.
- I really needed this.
- Yeah, it was nothing.
For you.
You should see Cohen with a power saw.
How do you know about the Care Bear stare?
- Dude, leave it alone.
- No, I'm just curious.
- Isn't he cute?
- It's like...
It's kind of...
- Previously on The O.C.:
- What about that date?
- You're breaking up with me?
- It never could work.
- Cal, when you wanna date, let me know.
- It was an accident.
You accidentally slept with Marissa's mom or accidentally told Marissa?
- I just...
- Get out of here, Luke.
- I don't wanna see him again.
- What about your dad?
Kaitlin?
What am I supposed to do without you?
You are not leaving this house.
Or what?
You're gonna call the police or Dr. Milano?
You know what?
Go ahead.
In fact, why don't you call up Dad and Caleb?
I'd really love to tell them why I ran away.
You okay?
Yeah, it's just really sad.
It's just the movie, right?
That's the reason for the tears?
Yes.
I'm emotionally stable.
Besides, I'm not the only one crying.
I'm sorry, what?
I'm allergic, okay?
And there's so much pollen in here right now.
It's ridiculous.
- Tomorrow we're watching football, okay?
- Football season is five months away.
ESPN Classics, okay?
We'll watch old games.
Maybe next time we should see a comedy.
What?
No, no.
I can see sad movies.
Yeah.
No, I know you can.
I can't, Ryan, I'm sensitive.
- Okay, so, what now?
- Whatever Coop wants to do.
- Yeah, what do you wanna to do?
- I don't know.
It's getting late.
- So you wanna go back?
- Why don't we have a slumber party.
- I'll stay over.
- We all will.
We'll sleep in shifts.
- That way, one of us'll be up at all times.
- Doing what?
Hey, whatever you need us to do.
- Look, okay?
Guys, I'm fine.
- Yeah, yeah.
We know.
Why wouldn't you be?
I don't know, because the guy I lost my virginity to had sex with my mom.
- Oh, yeah, I remember that.
- Look, guys, it's really not that big a deal.
- Why don't we go to Jamba Juice?
- That's a great idea.
I love juice.
- Remember that thing with vitamin C?
- The boosts.
Free boosts.
Sit down.
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Well, it's not like I had any choice.
All your phone calls and e-mails.
I had to block you from my Buddy List you were so incessant.
- Blocked me?
I thought you were off-line.
You want something?
- The Razzmatazz is...
- Luke I told you, I'm not staying.
So tell me, what is it that's so important?
If you drink it too fast, you can get a brain freeze.
- So sip it slowly.
- That's good advice.
Okay, guys, I can drink a cold beverage.
I'm telling you, I'm really so not okay.
I guess we'll skip the Razzmatazz.
Hey.
Sorry.
I'm surprised that hasn't happened before.
I'm not saying I'm disappointed it hasn't happened before.
- I'm saying the mathematical probability...
- Crying during chick flicks.
- Walking in on me getting dressed.
- What's your point?
I'm not seeing what you're getting at.
- Do you work out?
- Not really.
Me neither.
I'm gonna go watch some hockey.
- Hockey season's over.
- Damn it.
- Where you going?
- To find Luke.
Beat the crap out of him.
- Where'll the can of whup-ass be opened?
- I'll go to his house, check the pier.
Have you considered our back yard?
- What's up, guys?
- Why don't you tell me?
- Calm down.
I didn't come to fight.
- You told me it was over.
It is.
Believe me.
I just...
I had to talk to her.
Next time you wanna talk to somebody, talk to Seth, me.
Anyone but her.
No one will talk to me.
Sleeping with your ex-girlfriend's mom kind of yields that result.
- I thought you were my friends.
- You got no friends.
I know.
- But I need your help.
- I'm not gonna help you.
- I'm leaving.
- Thanks for stopping by.
No, I mean, I'm leaving town.
Now that the divorce is final, my dad just wants to get out, so...
- We got family in Portland.
- You're going with him?
Don't tell anybody.
But that's what I was trying to tell Julie.
And that's what I wanna tell Marissa.
But I wanna tell her myself.
- Look, I don't know, Luke.
- Come on.
Please, please.
Five minutes.
It's not that much to ask, to say goodbye.
Then I'm gone.
Please.
- You okay?
- Yeah, just checking the paper for any impending natural disasters before tomorrow's grand opening.
- You're not nervous, are you?
- No, why be nervous?
If our pre-celebration tonight goes badly there'll be no time to fix it before tomorrow night.
I like to anticipate the worst at all times.
It's a Cohen family trait.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Yes!
- What is that?
- We're business partners.
- We needed our own secret handshake.
- Secret handshake?
- It's a guy thing.
- You couldn't possibly understand.
- Is this okay?
Or is it putting the "ho" in hostess?
Hailey, it looks great.
But it's not my restaurant.
Jimmy?
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, I mean we should ask Sandy because...
- I don't have shoes.
It'll serve to distract the customers, which is good, since they won't be drinking.
The Liquor Board is reneging on our liquor license.
- They can't.
They gave us a permit.
- Must be a mix-up.
I'll call the inspector.
See, that's why we Cohens are always right.
Because the worst always happens.
Come on, Hail.
I'll go get your shoes.
So you like the dress?
It's definitely a keeper.
So you'd sit in my section?
How do you even make waitress-speak sound so...?
Dirty?
I was gonna say "untoward," but, yeah.
Hail, it's your feet, not mine.
Can you believe this?
Okay, Coop.
So what's it gonna be, a little salt glow?
Little Tahitian body wrap?
Or maybe a lotion boot?
Okay, not really into exfoliating right now.
Besides, I promised Ryan I'd meet him for lunch at the pier.
Lunch at the pier.
Corn dogs and pizza.
You know, I read an article in Stuff.
It says carbs send endorphins to your brain and that makes you happy.
Oh, that's probably Ryan.
I gotta go grab it.
Where'd you leave your phone?
Your dad's room?
No, my room.
You have a room?
Wait.
Hello?
Yeah, Coop.
Like what you've done with the place.
Yeah, I guess I didn't really get around to unpacking.
How can you live like this?
Your T-shirts touch your sweaters.
I figured that if I didn't hang anything up then it wouldn't be so permanent.
Anyway, I gotta go meet Ryan.
So do you wanna come or...?
You know what?
Do you mind if I hang out here and watch TV?
The step-monster got her wisdom teeth pulled.
She's whacked out on Percocet leaving drool all over the house.
- Okay, sure.
Go ahead.
I'll see you later.
- I can't believe they're seeing each other.
- They're not.
- That's not what it looked like last night.
- Last night wasn't what it looked like.
I talked to Luke.
What?
You guys are still hanging out?
No, he showed up.
He wants to talk to you.
Apologize.
No.
There's no way I could forgive him.
- Maybe for Holly.
But not for this.
- I know but it would mean a lot to him.
What's important to him is really not so important to me.
That's a whole part of my life I'd just rather keep separate from this part of my life.
You know what we haven't done in a while?
Listen, I'm all for getting it on in exotic locales.
But I think your best friend's bedroom's just really disheveled.
Wow.
I like what she's done with the place.
The cardboard boxes, it feels very...
I'm getting like a garage-sale vibe.
Yes, I know.
See, they say your external life influences your internal life.
- Who says that?
- I read it in ELLE Decor.
- Your favorite magazine.
- You read?
No wonder she's so depressed.
We need to surprise her and fix it up.
Do you think giving her a little feng shui will help her forget her mom slept with her ex-boyfriend?
- It can't hurt.
Right.
Well, that's very sweet.
But if you put a mirror on that wall, it'd open up the energy flow in this room.
- I know where you're going with this.
- The hardware store.
The hardware store?
With, like, the bolts and the grouting and the Skil saws?
You don't like hardware stores and you cry during chick flicks.
Next thing you're gonna tell me, you walk in on Ryan changing.
Come on.
That's crazy.
Hey, let's go to the hardware store.
Peter Johnson, from the Liquor Board.
Am I right?
You came here about a month ago and granted us a liquor license.
Craziest thing.
I open my mail, and I read that our liquor license had been reneged.
Yes.
- Yeah, crazy?
- Yes, your license has been reneged.
Without a liquor license, this place can't turn a profit.
This is Newport Beach.
Everyone's a borderline alcoholic.
I'm sorry, but your temporary license was issued before your file landed in front of the newly appointed commissioner.
- So?
- The name Steve Peiser mean anything?
No.
Well, it might to Jimmy Cooper.
Turns out Mr. Cooper was Commissioner Peiser's financial advisor before he stole a quarter of a million dollars from him.
You're kidding me.
It was that financial loss that forced my boss out of retirement and back to work.
He saw Cooper's name on the file and said "no way."
Want my advice?
Have Mr. Cooper step down.
So, what do you wanna do for lunch?
I can do mac and cheese or mac and cheese.
Tough choice.
- I forgot how fun this was.
- Pretty fun.
You know, lunch could wait.
We are having a pretty big dinner.
- Not your dad, is it?
- No, he has a key.
- Mr. Nichol.
- Call me Caleb.
I'm not disturbing you, am I?
No.
Yeah, come in.
- Ryan.
- Mr. Nichol.
Would you mind if Marissa and I had a word, privately?
- Sure.
- Actually, Ryan and I don't have secrets.
It's important.
Well, then I definitely want him here.
What follows doesn't leave this room then, okay?
Sit down.
Marissa, your mother's a wonderful woman.
She is?
You're important to her.
You and I haven't spent a lot of time together but it was important to me to come and get your blessing.
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
- You wanna marry my mom?
- I love her very much.
- You don't know her.
- You should give Marissa some time.
- This is kind of a big deal.
- Impossible.
I intend to propose to her tonight at the restaurant with our friends and family in attendance.
Well, then I guess I can't stop you.
I'll see you both tonight.
Thanks for your time, dear.
And again, this is just between us.
I want it to be a surprise.
If my mom marries him, she's gonna be the most powerful woman in Newport.
Not if you tell Caleb the truth.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Did you talk to her?
- I tried.
- And?
- I don't think it's gonna happen, man.
- What do you mean?
- She's dealing with a lot of stuff now.
- Family stuff.
- She won't even see me for 30 seconds?
Her dad's restaurant's having its private opening tonight.
She's busy.
- I'm leaving town.
- She doesn't know.
- That's because she won't talk to me.
- Why don't you just write her a letter?
Write her a letter?
- I had your back with Oliver.
- You had sex with her mom.
I didn't just have sex with her, okay?
!
I'm in love with her!
- I was...
I am in love!
- Don't need to hear it.
But Marissa does.
I have to talk to her.
I have to explain.
- Luke, I wouldn't.
- I can't go without making it right.
I won't.
Okay, the plan is, we go to dinner for, like, 10 minutes, right?
Then we sneak out, come back here and make magic happen.
Excellent.
I'm extremely stealth.
1996, All-School Hide-and-Seek champion.
I do believe Joel Gordon is still looking for me.
The fool.
Hey!
Last year's yearbook.
- God, I love yearbooks.
- Listen, let's put it away because we've got a lot of work to do.
- Stop it!
- Let's just put it back.
Hey, it's you.
- We had a sailing team?
- Yeah.
It never got off the ground, but...
- You were in the Comic Book Club?
- I was the president and only member.
Let's see.
- We had a Film Preservation Society?
- Yeah, but it was a long time ago.
So you know, we don't have to...
It's not fun.
Was I really mean to you?
No.
That would have required you to speak to me.
Or anyone to speak to me.
A lot's changed in a year, huh?
Hey.
"Marissa, you're the greatest.
This summer will rock.
- Love you forever, Luke."
- Yeah.
A lot's definitely changed.
Marissa's gonna need a whole lot of feng shui.
Hey.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
You look sad.
I thought this would be a moment to celebrate.
So did I.
You know that mix-up with the liquor license?
- It's not such a mix-up.
- You're kidding.
It turns out the new commissioner is a former client of Jimmy's with a quarter-million dollar score to settle.
Without that license, there's no point opening.
I've been on the phone trying to call in favors.
I got nothing.
The guy is serious.
The only way he'll reconsider is if Jimmy steps down.
Leaves the business.
- You're not considering...
- No, of course not.
Well, there is one last option.
You're not gonna like it.
My dad can be very...
He can be very persuasive.
I may have to throw a few more of these back before you start bringing up Caleb.
Desperate times.
This is that.
Hey, man.
What's going on?
- Where you been?
- What?
- What?
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
Not one thing, okay?
- All right.
I'm gonna go pee, okay?
So if anyone asks, that's where I am.
For a while.
Right.
- He's getting weirder.
- Didn't think that was possible.
Marissa.
Mom.
That's the warmest conversation I've had with her in weeks.
I'll have a word, see if I can't help.
I have been known to be quite persuasive.
So I've heard.
What's with Dad these days?
He's all warm and mushy.
Don't know.
Maybe it's the new blood-thinning medication he's on.
What about you?
How's your romantic life?
Oh, you know me.
Not much.
Vince, thank you so much.
How excited is Jimmy?
He's like a totally different person.
It's so great.
Let's hope tomorrow night goes as well as tonight.
- Pat.
Thanks for coming by.
- My pleasure.
Though I gotta say, Nana Cohen's meat loaf, trouncing Grandma Cooper's.
- She would expect no less.
- How'd it go today with the Liquor Board?
- All sorted out?
- Working on it.
Working on it.
Enjoy it, Jimmy.
Moments like this don't happen every day.
I know.
It's fantastic.
- Hey.
- How you doing?
I'm just happy you're here, so I don't have to do this alone.
You know me.
Can't get enough of this stuff.
Excuse me, everyone.
I have something I'd like to say.
I hope you're all enjoying yourselves tonight as much as I am.
Though my enjoyment of life over the last few months goes beyond this restaurant to a very special lady, Julie Cooper.
What's he doing here?
Julie did a fantastic job on the d Ácor, didn't she?
Hey, come on, let's go.
And...
- It's here on this opening night...
- Nobody'll talk to me or even look at me.
- Had a little bit to drink?
- I'd like to show her how special she is.
I gotta tell Marissa it wasn't just sex.
I love her mom.
Okay, I don't think that's a good idea.
Julie Cooper will you marry me?
Oh, my God!
Yes, of course I will, Cal.
Kiki!
Luke.
Hey.
Luke.
Hey!
- Look, Luke...
- Don't make me!
Just give me your keys.
Let me drive you home.
What home?
I can't believe he just showed up here.
- I need your car.
I need to go after him.
- No.
It's like you're saying he did nothing wrong.
I'm not taking his side.
I'm not taking any side.
You know what?
Maybe you should.
He should have time alone to think about what he did.
- Feel bad about it.
- He does feel bad...
- That's why he's leaving.
- What are you talking about?
His dad's moving to Portland.
He's moving with him.
Because of what happened.
Can I have your keys?
He's had a lot to drink.
- That's cool.
I didn't want any, anyway.
- My dad is marrying Julie Cooper.
Julie Cooper is my stepmom.
- Maybe we'll get you another bottle.
- Drink up.
This is an unholy alliance, two storm fronts colliding.
It's the apocalypse for us.
- Maybe you wanna lay off the sauce.
- Think of it.
All the time we were growing up and you'd come over for dinner you'd go sailing with my dad, did you ever think he would marry your ex-wife?
- Yeah, give me a glass.
- Never.
Jimbo, the way I see it, this might be the best thing that could happen to you.
There is nothing good about it.
This marriage is an asteroid that hit the Earth.
Now we have to see what species survives.
I did it.
Look.
Wow, you hit a nail!
Bob Vila's your bitch, Cohen.
What?
!
Why?
!
- This is not supposed to happen.
- You have to find the stud.
- You mean like you did, Summer?
- Just get me the stud finder.
Oh, Summer, I think you are the stud finder.
- See this hammer in my hand?
- What does the stud finder look like?
- And the level.
- What is a level?
- Don't you know what a level is?
- What you advance to in a video game.
That's funny.
Yeah.
The tool doesn't know about tools.
My people, we don't really build.
We're not what you would call "handy."
We hire people to do it.
Why don't we just get a contractor?
Or I can paint.
And here I thought you could only paint the ceiling.
Marissa, hey, listen, I...
No, no.
It's me, man.
- I'm fine, man.
- You don't sound fine.
Well, you know, I'm just having a few beers up at the park rocking out to Seger.
You know the drill.
Not really.
Hey, do me a favor, Ryan.
Tell Marissa I get it.
Okay?
I don 't deserve her forgiveness.
I'm...
I'm scum.
I'm...
All I ever did was let her down.
Tell her that.
No, just tell me where you are, all right?
You can't leave without saying goodbye, right?
Right.
Goodbye.
Damn it!
I'm not here.
Leave a message.
Julie.
I'm...
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I need to see you.
I'm coming...
I'm coming to see you.
You owe me a goodbye!
Without a liquor license, we'll be belly-up in no time.
- Really?
Cal, I had no idea.
- There's no point in opening the place.
That's why I was hoping I could ask you to do me a favor.
- What?
- Wait, did you not hear me?
I just wanted to hear you say it again.
If it was up to me, I'd rather take the hit than talk with you.
But it's Jimmy.
- The Lighthouse is all he's got.
- Lf you drop him, they'd issue the license.
But you're too much of a martyr.
Listen, Sanford never mix business with friendship.
- You're right.
From now on, I'm doing all my deals with you.
When you came to me about Uncle Shaun, I said yes.
You owe me.
I don't wanna owe you.
I wanna hold it over your head.
Need water.
Tried to lie down, got the spins.
Well, I better get back to my bride-to-be.
Oh, yeah.
Definitely might vomit.
Luke, call us when you get this.
Ryan.
When I saw him at the party last night I wished for something like this to happen.
It's not your fault.
- How is he?
- Well, he's out of surgery.
He's pretty much out of commission right now, but the worst is behind him.
I should call my parents.
You guys he's gonna be asleep for a while.
You should go home.
- Maybe we should, so we could finish.
- Or we could sleep.
You know, I'm really glad that Luke's gonna be okay.
We'll come back.
Actually, I'm gonna stay.
You know, just in case.
Okay.
Then I'll stay too.
I heard he'd been drinking which makes one less inspired to go after our liquor license.
- Can I get you something to eat?
- No, no, I'm good.
Don't worry about going to city hall.
I'll deal with them.
You hold down the fort.
That's not necessary.
You hang at the Lighthouse.
Man the ship.
Are we gonna refer to the restaurant as a ship or a fort?
Well, right now it's a sinking ship.
Okay, not the most inspiring metaphor on our opening night.
Why don't you sit down?
I can't.
I gotta go see what the holdup is with the liquor license.
You're the holdup, Jimmy.
Does the name Steve Peiser mean anything to you?
When he went back to work, after his financial advisor lost his life savings he got a job as commissioner of the Liquor Board.
This restaurant was supposed to be a chance for me to escape from my past.
I guess there is no escaping, huh?
Well, we do have one possible Houdini-esque escape left.
Caleb.
I asked him for help.
- You hate asking him for help.
- This was no exception.
I had no choice.
You did.
You could've told me the truth and asked me to bow out.
Like I said, I had no choice.
Satellite Pharmacy to room 607.
Satellite Pharmacy, room 607.
Hey, guys.
He's up.
You should go home.
And thanks for waiting, all right?
Wait.
Will you tell him that I'm here and I'd like to see him?
I'll start auditioning bands right away.
I need to start soliciting recommendations for the videographer and the photographer, the engravers.
You know, I should ask Diane Kahn.
She's been married, like, at least a half a dozen times.
Why aren't you more excited?
Oh, Julie, it was a rough night.
Hey, where are you going?
Why aren't you asleep?
Because Summer's a slave driver.
Is Ryan back from the hospital yet?
- Hospital?
- Oh, didn't you hear?
Luke wrapped his truck around a telephone pole last night.
- He did?
- Just a few blocks from here.
He was drinking.
So unlike him.
Well, I guess he just never really recovered from everything with his father.
You know, the humiliation, his family being torn apart.
Yeah, that must be it.
Pour me a bloody mary, will you, James?
Since it'll be the last drink we serve.
- What?
That's it?
- Hook, line and sinker.
No license.
No opening.
No restaurant.
- No comeback.
- That's the best you could do?
- As big a badass as you are?
- Didn't have an effect on this Peiser fella.
You know how to piss people off.
You could teach me a thing or two.
- You seem awfully glib.
- Everything happens for a reason.
Could you at least feign a little sensitivity at our misfortune?
You know what they say:
One man's misfortune is another man's fortune.
- Who says that?
- I do.
- I've never seen him smile.
- I didn't know he had teeth.
Make yourselves a couple of drinks, fellas.
We should talk.
Cheers.
Are you okay?
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean for this to happen.
Any of it.
I just...
I didn't have anyone.
I had no one.
Not my family.
I don't know, you know?
But I'm gonna go away.
Give things a chance to go back to normal for you.
Because I know as long as I'm here, they won't.
But I need to know one thing before I go.
Can you forgive me?
Yeah.
Yes.
Luke I'll miss you.
Who would've thought when you moved to town that I'd be the one who had to leave?
I thought I was gonna live in Newport my whole life.
So you'll start a new life.
Yeah, maybe I'll show up in Portland and fall for the chick dating the captain of the football team.
And he can kick your ass.
Yeah.
Welcome to Portland, bitch.
Well, I'll e-mail you.
Maybe I'll drop back in say hey.
Good luck, man.
Want me to take you home?
I hate her so much.
I mean, she tried to drive you out.
She almost destroyed my dad.
She nearly killed Luke.
I have to do something.
Okay.
So where we going?
Marissa.
Hello.
Come in.
Is everything all right?
Actually, no, it's not.
We need to talk about my mom.
I was just thinking the same thing.
Sit down, please.
I know things between you and your mom have been rocky this year.
- Can you both put the past behind you?
- You have no idea what she's like or what she's done.
- I know.
I know.
Everything.
We should use this occasion as a chance to heal.
Make a fresh start.
Family is very important to me, Marissa.
I want us all to be a real family.
- Your sister deserves that, so do you.
- We already have a dad.
I'm well aware.
I'm not trying to replace him, push him out.
Quite the opposite, in fact.
As of today I'm the only chance your father has.
- What are you talking about?
This morning I offered to buy the Balboa Lighthouse from both he and Sandy for several million dollars.
Considering the fact that the restaurant will never open, make a cent I'd say it was a pretty good deal.
However, if I were to change my mind decide it was a bad investment, lose my checkbook your father would be ruined.
Penniless.
Run out of town.
Which is where I come in.
You are very important to your mother.
She is very important to me.
- Be part of our family.
- Which means what, exactly?
Well, you're already part of the wedding.
When your mom moves in you come and live with us too.
- You're joking, right?
It would mean everything to her.
And if I do this, then you'll definitely buy the restaurant?
This conversation would have to remain confidential.
You wouldn't want my mom to know you blackmailed me into living with her?
So do we have a deal?
Wonderful.
Now, was there something else that you wanted to ask me about?
- You okay?
- I'm a prisoner in my own life.
I'm great.
- Well, you did what you needed to do.
- Yeah.
- I guess I just need some sleep.
- Yeah, okay.
I'll call you...
I told you, no touching anything, ever.
- You're such a dandy, Cohen.
- You're a dandy, woman.
- Fine, take it.
- No.
I don't want it.
Oh, my God!
Those are tears of joy, yes?
I...
I don't even know what to say.
Summer did all the building.
And the heavy lifting.
And the wiring of the electronics.
But I painted.
I know you're a Paris fan.
It's amazing.
This is so cool.
We looked through your toys and couldn't find any plastic horses but we did find this.
Share Bear!
Wow!
Yeah, she'll watch over you with her Care Bear stare.
How do you know about the Care Bear stare?
- I painted that.
- Yes, you did.
I did.
Thanks, you guys.
- I really needed this.
- Yeah, it was nothing.
For you.
You should see Cohen with a power saw.
How do you know about the Care Bear stare?
- Dude, leave it alone.
- No, I'm just curious.
- Isn't he cute?
- It's like...
It's kind of...
- Previously on The O.C.:
- What about that date?
- You're breaking up with me?
- It never could work.
- Cal, when you wanna date, let me know.
- It was an accident.
You accidentally slept with Marissa's mom or accidentally told Marissa?
- I just...
- Get out of here, Luke.
- I don't wanna see him again.
- What about your dad?
Kaitlin?
What am I supposed to do without you?
You are not leaving this house.
Or what?
You're gonna call the police or Dr. Milano?
You know what?
Go ahead.
In fact, why don't you call up Dad and Caleb?
I'd really love to tell them why I ran away.
You okay?
Yeah, it's just really sad.
It's just the movie, right?
That's the reason for the tears?
Yes.
I'm emotionally stable.
Besides, I'm not the only one crying.
I'm sorry, what?
I'm allergic, okay?
And there's so much pollen in here right now.
It's ridiculous.
- Tomorrow we're watching football, okay?
- Football season is five months away.
ESPN Classics, okay?
We'll watch old games.
Maybe next time we should see a comedy.
What?
No, no.
I can see sad movies.
Yeah.
No, I know you can.
I can't, Ryan, I'm sensitive.
- Okay, so, what now?
- Whatever Coop wants to do.
- Yeah, what do you wanna to do?
- I don't know.
It's getting late.
- So you wanna go back?
- Why don't we have a slumber party.
- I'll stay over.
- We all will.
We'll sleep in shifts.
- That way, one of us'll be up at all times.
- Doing what?
Hey, whatever you need us to do.
- Look, okay?
Guys, I'm fine.
- Yeah, yeah.
We know.
Why wouldn't you be?
I don't know, because the guy I lost my virginity to had sex with my mom.
- Oh, yeah, I remember that.
- Look, guys, it's really not that big a deal.
- Why don't we go to Jamba Juice?
- That's a great idea.
I love juice.
- Remember that thing with vitamin C?
- The boosts.
Free boosts.
Sit down.
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Well, it's not like I had any choice.
All your phone calls and e-mails.
I had to block you from my Buddy List you were so incessant.
- Blocked me?
I thought you were off-line.
You want something?
- The Razzmatazz is...
- Luke I told you, I'm not staying.
So tell me, what is it that's so important?
If you drink it too fast, you can get a brain freeze.
- So sip it slowly.
- That's good advice.
Okay, guys, I can drink a cold beverage.
I'm telling you, I'm really so not okay.
I guess we'll skip the Razzmatazz.
Hey.
Sorry.
I'm surprised that hasn't happened before.
I'm not saying I'm disappointed it hasn't happened before.
- I'm saying the mathematical probability...
- Crying during chick flicks.
- Walking in on me getting dressed.
- What's your point?
I'm not seeing what you're getting at.
- Do you work out?
- Not really.
Me neither.
I'm gonna go watch some hockey.
- Hockey season's over.
- Damn it.
- Where you going?
- To find Luke.
Beat the crap out of him.
- Where'll the can of whup-ass be opened?
- I'll go to his house, check the pier.
Have you considered our back yard?
- What's up, guys?
- Why don't you tell me?
- Calm down.
I didn't come to fight.
- You told me it was over.
It is.
Believe me.
I just...
I had to talk to her.
Next time you wanna talk to somebody, talk to Seth, me.
Anyone but her.
No one will talk to me.
Sleeping with your ex-girlfriend's mom kind of yields that result.
- I thought you were my friends.
- You got no friends.
I know.
- But I need your help.
- I'm not gonna help you.
- I'm leaving.
- Thanks for stopping by.
No, I mean, I'm leaving town.
Now that the divorce is final, my dad just wants to get out, so...
- We got family in Portland.
- You're going with him?
Don't tell anybody.
But that's what I was trying to tell Julie.
And that's what I wanna tell Marissa.
But I wanna tell her myself.
- Look, I don't know, Luke.
- Come on.
Please, please.
Five minutes.
It's not that much to ask, to say goodbye.
Then I'm gone.
Please.
- You okay?
- Yeah, just checking the paper for any impending natural disasters before tomorrow's grand opening.
- You're not nervous, are you?
- No, why be nervous?
If our pre-celebration tonight goes badly there'll be no time to fix it before tomorrow night.
I like to anticipate the worst at all times.
It's a Cohen family trait.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Yes!
- What is that?
- We're business partners.
- We needed our own secret handshake.
- Secret handshake?
- It's a guy thing.
- You couldn't possibly understand.
- Is this okay?
Or is it putting the "ho" in hostess?
Hailey, it looks great.
But it's not my restaurant.
Jimmy?
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, I mean we should ask Sandy because...
- I don't have shoes.
It'll serve to distract the customers, which is good, since they won't be drinking.
The Liquor Board is reneging on our liquor license.
- They can't.
They gave us a permit.
- Must be a mix-up.
I'll call the inspector.
See, that's why we Cohens are always right.
Because the worst always happens.
Come on, Hail.
I'll go get your shoes.
So you like the dress?
It's definitely a keeper.
So you'd sit in my section?
How do you even make waitress-speak sound so...?
Dirty?
I was gonna say "untoward," but, yeah.
Hail, it's your feet, not mine.
Can you believe this?
Okay, Coop.
So what's it gonna be, a little salt glow?
Little Tahitian body wrap?
Or maybe a lotion boot?
Okay, not really into exfoliating right now.
Besides, I promised Ryan I'd meet him for lunch at the pier.
Lunch at the pier.
Corn dogs and pizza.
You know, I read an article in Stuff.
It says carbs send endorphins to your brain and that makes you happy.
Oh, that's probably Ryan.
I gotta go grab it.
Where'd you leave your phone?
Your dad's room?
No, my room.
You have a room?
Wait.
Hello?
Yeah, Coop.
Like what you've done with the place.
Yeah, I guess I didn't really get around to unpacking.
How can you live like this?
Your T-shirts touch your sweaters.
I figured that if I didn't hang anything up then it wouldn't be so permanent.
Anyway, I gotta go meet Ryan.
So do you wanna come or...?
You know what?
Do you mind if I hang out here and watch TV?
The step-monster got her wisdom teeth pulled.
She's whacked out on Percocet leaving drool all over the house.
- Okay, sure.
Go ahead.
I'll see you later.
- I can't believe they're seeing each other.
- They're not.
- That's not what it looked like last night.
- Last night wasn't what it looked like.
I talked to Luke.
What?
You guys are still hanging out?
No, he showed up.
He wants to talk to you.
Apologize.
No.
There's no way I could forgive him.
- Maybe for Holly.
But not for this.
- I know but it would mean a lot to him.
What's important to him is really not so important to me.
That's a whole part of my life I'd just rather keep separate from this part of my life.
You know what we haven't done in a while?
Listen, I'm all for getting it on in exotic locales.
But I think your best friend's bedroom's just really disheveled.
Wow.
I like what she's done with the place.
The cardboard boxes, it feels very...
I'm getting like a garage-sale vibe.
Yes, I know.
See, they say your external life influences your internal life.
- Who says that?
- I read it in ELLE Decor.
- Your favorite magazine.
- You read?
No wonder she's so depressed.
We need to surprise her and fix it up.
Do you think giving her a little feng shui will help her forget her mom slept with her ex-boyfriend?
- It can't hurt.
Right.
Well, that's very sweet.
But if you put a mirror on that wall, it'd open up the energy flow in this room.
- I know where you're going with this.
- The hardware store.
The hardware store?
With, like, the bolts and the grouting and the Skil saws?
You don't like hardware stores and you cry during chick flicks.
Next thing you're gonna tell me, you walk in on Ryan changing.
Come on.
That's crazy.
Hey, let's go to the hardware store.
Peter Johnson, from the Liquor Board.
Am I right?
You came here about a month ago and granted us a liquor license.
Craziest thing.
I open my mail, and I read that our liquor license had been reneged.
Yes.
- Yeah, crazy?
- Yes, your license has been reneged.
Without a liquor license, this place can't turn a profit.
This is Newport Beach.
Everyone's a borderline alcoholic.
I'm sorry, but your temporary license was issued before your file landed in front of the newly appointed commissioner.
- So?
- The name Steve Peiser mean anything?
No.
Well, it might to Jimmy Cooper.
Turns out Mr. Cooper was Commissioner Peiser's financial advisor before he stole a quarter of a million dollars from him.
You're kidding me.
It was that financial loss that forced my boss out of retirement and back to work.
He saw Cooper's name on the file and said "no way."
Want my advice?
Have Mr. Cooper step down.
So, what do you wanna do for lunch?
I can do mac and cheese or mac and cheese.
Tough choice.
- I forgot how fun this was.
- Pretty fun.
You know, lunch could wait.
We are having a pretty big dinner.
- Not your dad, is it?
- No, he has a key.
- Mr. Nichol.
- Call me Caleb.
I'm not disturbing you, am I?
No.
Yeah, come in.
- Ryan.
- Mr. Nichol.
Would you mind if Marissa and I had a word, privately?
- Sure.
- Actually, Ryan and I don't have secrets.
It's important.
Well, then I definitely want him here.
What follows doesn't leave this room then, okay?
Sit down.
Marissa, your mother's a wonderful woman.
She is?
You're important to her.
You and I haven't spent a lot of time together but it was important to me to come and get your blessing.
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
- You wanna marry my mom?
- I love her very much.
- You don't know her.
- You should give Marissa some time.
- This is kind of a big deal.
- Impossible.
I intend to propose to her tonight at the restaurant with our friends and family in attendance.
Well, then I guess I can't stop you.
I'll see you both tonight.
Thanks for your time, dear.
And again, this is just between us.
I want it to be a surprise.
If my mom marries him, she's gonna be the most powerful woman in Newport.
Not if you tell Caleb the truth.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Did you talk to her?
- I tried.
- And?
- I don't think it's gonna happen, man.
- What do you mean?
- She's dealing with a lot of stuff now.
- Family stuff.
- She won't even see me for 30 seconds?
Her dad's restaurant's having its private opening tonight.
She's busy.
- I'm leaving town.
- She doesn't know.
- That's because she won't talk to me.
- Why don't you just write her a letter?
Write her a letter?
- I had your back with Oliver.
- You had sex with her mom.
I didn't just have sex with her, okay?
!
I'm in love with her!
- I was...
I am in love!
- Don't need to hear it.
But Marissa does.
I have to talk to her.
I have to explain.
- Luke, I wouldn't.
- I can't go without making it right.
I won't.
Okay, the plan is, we go to dinner for, like, 10 minutes, right?
Then we sneak out, come back here and make magic happen.
Excellent.
I'm extremely stealth.
1996, All-School Hide-and-Seek champion.
I do believe Joel Gordon is still looking for me.
The fool.
Hey!
Last year's yearbook.
- God, I love yearbooks.
- Listen, let's put it away because we've got a lot of work to do.
- Stop it!
- Let's just put it back.
Hey, it's you.
- We had a sailing team?
- Yeah.
It never got off the ground, but...
- You were in the Comic Book Club?
- I was the president and only member.
Let's see.
- We had a Film Preservation Society?
- Yeah, but it was a long time ago.
So you know, we don't have to...
It's not fun.
Was I really mean to you?
No.
That would have required you to speak to me.
Or anyone to speak to me.
A lot's changed in a year, huh?
Hey.
"Marissa, you're the greatest.
This summer will rock.
- Love you forever, Luke."
- Yeah.
A lot's definitely changed.
Marissa's gonna need a whole lot of feng shui.
Hey.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
You look sad.
I thought this would be a moment to celebrate.
So did I.
You know that mix-up with the liquor license?
- It's not such a mix-up.
- You're kidding.
It turns out the new commissioner is a former client of Jimmy's with a quarter-million dollar score to settle.
Without that license, there's no point opening.
I've been on the phone trying to call in favors.
I got nothing.
The guy is serious.
The only way he'll reconsider is if Jimmy steps down.
Leaves the business.
- You're not considering...
- No, of course not.
Well, there is one last option.
You're not gonna like it.
My dad can be very...
He can be very persuasive.
I may have to throw a few more of these back before you start bringing up Caleb.
Desperate times.
This is that.
Hey, man.
What's going on?
- Where you been?
- What?
- What?
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
Not one thing, okay?
- All right.
I'm gonna go pee, okay?
So if anyone asks, that's where I am.
For a while.
Right.
- He's getting weirder.
- Didn't think that was possible.
Marissa.
Mom.
That's the warmest conversation I've had with her in weeks.
I'll have a word, see if I can't help.
I have been known to be quite persuasive.
So I've heard.
What's with Dad these days?
He's all warm and mushy.
Don't know.
Maybe it's the new blood-thinning medication he's on.
What about you?
How's your romantic life?
Oh, you know me.
Not much.
Vince, thank you so much.
How excited is Jimmy?
He's like a totally different person.
It's so great.
Let's hope tomorrow night goes as well as tonight.
- Pat.
Thanks for coming by.
- My pleasure.
Though I gotta say, Nana Cohen's meat loaf, trouncing Grandma Cooper's.
- She would expect no less.
- How'd it go today with the Liquor Board?
- All sorted out?
- Working on it.
Working on it.
Enjoy it, Jimmy.
Moments like this don't happen every day.
I know.
It's fantastic.
- Hey.
- How you doing?
I'm just happy you're here, so I don't have to do this alone.
You know me.
Can't get enough of this stuff.
Excuse me, everyone.
I have something I'd like to say.
I hope you're all enjoying yourselves tonight as much as I am.
Though my enjoyment of life over the last few months goes beyond this restaurant to a very special lady, Julie Cooper.
What's he doing here?
Julie did a fantastic job on the d Ácor, didn't she?
Hey, come on, let's go.
And...
- It's here on this opening night...
- Nobody'll talk to me or even look at me.
- Had a little bit to drink?
- I'd like to show her how special she is.
I gotta tell Marissa it wasn't just sex.
I love her mom.
Okay, I don't think that's a good idea.
Julie Cooper will you marry me?
Oh, my God!
Yes, of course I will, Cal.
Kiki!
Luke.
Hey.
Luke.
Hey!
- Look, Luke...
- Don't make me!
Just give me your keys.
Let me drive you home.
What home?
I can't believe he just showed up here.
- I need your car.
I need to go after him.
- No.
It's like you're saying he did nothing wrong.
I'm not taking his side.
I'm not taking any side.
You know what?
Maybe you should.
He should have time alone to think about what he did.
- Feel bad about it.
- He does feel bad...
- That's why he's leaving.
- What are you talking about?
His dad's moving to Portland.
He's moving with him.
Because of what happened.
Can I have your keys?
He's had a lot to drink.
- That's cool.
I didn't want any, anyway.
- My dad is marrying Julie Cooper.
Julie Cooper is my stepmom.
- Maybe we'll get you another bottle.
- Drink up.
This is an unholy alliance, two storm fronts colliding.
It's the apocalypse for us.
- Maybe you wanna lay off the sauce.
- Think of it.
All the time we were growing up and you'd come over for dinner you'd go sailing with my dad, did you ever think he would marry your ex-wife?
- Yeah, give me a glass.
- Never.
Jimbo, the way I see it, this might be the best thing that could happen to you.
There is nothing good about it.
This marriage is an asteroid that hit the Earth.
Now we have to see what species survives.
I did it.
Look.
Wow, you hit a nail!
Bob Vila's your bitch, Cohen.
What?
!
Why?
!
- This is not supposed to happen.
- You have to find the stud.
- You mean like you did, Summer?
- Just get me the stud finder.
Oh, Summer, I think you are the stud finder.
- See this hammer in my hand?
- What does the stud finder look like?
- And the level.
- What is a level?
- Don't you know what a level is?
- What you advance to in a video game.
That's funny.
Yeah.
The tool doesn't know about tools.
My people, we don't really build.
We're not what you would call "handy."
We hire people to do it.
Why don't we just get a contractor?
Or I can paint.
And here I thought you could only paint the ceiling.
Marissa, hey, listen, I...
No, no.
It's me, man.
- I'm fine, man.
- You don't sound fine.
Well, you know, I'm just having a few beers up at the park rocking out to Seger.
You know the drill.
Not really.
Hey, do me a favor, Ryan.
Tell Marissa I get it.
Okay?
I don 't deserve her forgiveness.
I'm...
I'm scum.
I'm...
All I ever did was let her down.
Tell her that.
No, just tell me where you are, all right?
You can't leave without saying goodbye, right?
Right.
Goodbye.
Damn it!
I'm not here.
Leave a message.
Julie.
I'm...
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I need to see you.
I'm coming...
I'm coming to see you.
You owe me a goodbye!
Without a liquor license, we'll be belly-up in no time.
- Really?
Cal, I had no idea.
- There's no point in opening the place.
That's why I was hoping I could ask you to do me a favor.
- What?
- Wait, did you not hear me?
I just wanted to hear you say it again.
If it was up to me, I'd rather take the hit than talk with you.
But it's Jimmy.
- The Lighthouse is all he's got.
- Lf you drop him, they'd issue the license.
But you're too much of a martyr.
Listen, Sanford never mix business with friendship.
- You're right.
From now on, I'm doing all my deals with you.
When you came to me about Uncle Shaun, I said yes.
You owe me.
I don't wanna owe you.
I wanna hold it over your head.
Need water.
Tried to lie down, got the spins.
Well, I better get back to my bride-to-be.
Oh, yeah.
Definitely might vomit.
Luke, call us when you get this.
Ryan.
When I saw him at the party last night I wished for something like this to happen.
It's not your fault.
- How is he?
- Well, he's out of surgery.
He's pretty much out of commission right now, but the worst is behind him.
I should call my parents.
You guys he's gonna be asleep for a while.
You should go home.
- Maybe we should, so we could finish.
- Or we could sleep.
You know, I'm really glad that Luke's gonna be okay.
We'll come back.
Actually, I'm gonna stay.
You know, just in case.
Okay.
Then I'll stay too.
I heard he'd been drinking which makes one less inspired to go after our liquor license.
- Can I get you something to eat?
- No, no, I'm good.
Don't worry about going to city hall.
I'll deal with them.
You hold down the fort.
That's not necessary.
You hang at the Lighthouse.
Man the ship.
Are we gonna refer to the restaurant as a ship or a fort?
Well, right now it's a sinking ship.
Okay, not the most inspiring metaphor on our opening night.
Why don't you sit down?
I can't.
I gotta go see what the holdup is with the liquor license.
You're the holdup, Jimmy.
Does the name Steve Peiser mean anything to you?
When he went back to work, after his financial advisor lost his life savings he got a job as commissioner of the Liquor Board.
This restaurant was supposed to be a chance for me to escape from my past.
I guess there is no escaping, huh?
Well, we do have one possible Houdini-esque escape left.
Caleb.
I asked him for help.
- You hate asking him for help.
- This was no exception.
I had no choice.
You did.
You could've told me the truth and asked me to bow out.
Like I said, I had no choice.
Satellite Pharmacy to room 607.
Satellite Pharmacy, room 607.
Hey, guys.
He's up.
You should go home.
And thanks for waiting, all right?
Wait.
Will you tell him that I'm here and I'd like to see him?
I'll start auditioning bands right away.
I need to start soliciting recommendations for the videographer and the photographer, the engravers.
You know, I should ask Diane Kahn.
She's been married, like, at least a half a dozen times.
Why aren't you more excited?
Oh, Julie, it was a rough night.
Hey, where are you going?
Why aren't you asleep?
Because Summer's a slave driver.
Is Ryan back from the hospital yet?
- Hospital?
- Oh, didn't you hear?
Luke wrapped his truck around a telephone pole last night.
- He did?
- Just a few blocks from here.
He was drinking.
So unlike him.
Well, I guess he just never really recovered from everything with his father.
You know, the humiliation, his family being torn apart.
Yeah, that must be it.
Pour me a bloody mary, will you, James?
Since it'll be the last drink we serve.
- What?
That's it?
- Hook, line and sinker.
No license.
No opening.
No restaurant.
- No comeback.
- That's the best you could do?
- As big a badass as you are?
- Didn't have an effect on this Peiser fella.
You know how to piss people off.
You could teach me a thing or two.
- You seem awfully glib.
- Everything happens for a reason.
Could you at least feign a little sensitivity at our misfortune?
You know what they say:
One man's misfortune is another man's fortune.
- Who says that?
- I do.
- I've never seen him smile.
- I didn't know he had teeth.
Make yourselves a couple of drinks, fellas.
We should talk.
Cheers.
Are you okay?
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean for this to happen.
Any of it.
I just...
I didn't have anyone.
I had no one.
Not my family.
I don't know, you know?
But I'm gonna go away.
Give things a chance to go back to normal for you.
Because I know as long as I'm here, they won't.
But I need to know one thing before I go.
Can you forgive me?
Yeah.
Yes.
Luke I'll miss you.
Who would've thought when you moved to town that I'd be the one who had to leave?
I thought I was gonna live in Newport my whole life.
So you'll start a new life.
Yeah, maybe I'll show up in Portland and fall for the chick dating the captain of the football team.
And he can kick your ass.
Yeah.
Welcome to Portland, bitch.
Well, I'll e-mail you.
Maybe I'll drop back in say hey.
Good luck, man.
Want me to take you home?
I hate her so much.
I mean, she tried to drive you out.
She almost destroyed my dad.
She nearly killed Luke.
I have to do something.
Okay.
So where we going?
Marissa.
Hello.
Come in.
Is everything all right?
Actually, no, it's not.
We need to talk about my mom.
I was just thinking the same thing.
Sit down, please.
I know things between you and your mom have been rocky this year.
- Can you both put the past behind you?
- You have no idea what she's like or what she's done.
- I know.
I know.
Everything.
We should use this occasion as a chance to heal.
Make a fresh start.
Family is very important to me, Marissa.
I want us all to be a real family.
- Your sister deserves that, so do you.
- We already have a dad.
I'm well aware.
I'm not trying to replace him, push him out.
Quite the opposite, in fact.
As of today I'm the only chance your father has.
- What are you talking about?
This morning I offered to buy the Balboa Lighthouse from both he and Sandy for several million dollars.
Considering the fact that the restaurant will never open, make a cent I'd say it was a pretty good deal.
However, if I were to change my mind decide it was a bad investment, lose my checkbook your father would be ruined.
Penniless.
Run out of town.
Which is where I come in.
You are very important to your mother.
She is very important to me.
- Be part of our family.
- Which means what, exactly?
Well, you're already part of the wedding.
When your mom moves in you come and live with us too.
- You're joking, right?
It would mean everything to her.
And if I do this, then you'll definitely buy the restaurant?
This conversation would have to remain confidential.
You wouldn't want my mom to know you blackmailed me into living with her?
So do we have a deal?
Wonderful.
Now, was there something else that you wanted to ask me about?
- You okay?
- I'm a prisoner in my own life.
I'm great.
- Well, you did what you needed to do.
- Yeah.
- I guess I just need some sleep.
- Yeah, okay.
I'll call you...
I told you, no touching anything, ever.
- You're such a dandy, Cohen.
- You're a dandy, woman.
- Fine, take it.
- No.
I don't want it.
Oh, my God!
Those are tears of joy, yes?
I...
I don't even know what to say.
Summer did all the building.
And the heavy lifting.
And the wiring of the electronics.
But I painted.
I know you're a Paris fan.
It's amazing.
This is so cool.
We looked through your toys and couldn't find any plastic horses but we did find this.
Share Bear!
Wow!
Yeah, she'll watch over you with her Care Bear stare.
How do you know about the Care Bear stare?
- I painted that.
- Yes, you did.
I did.
Thanks, you guys.
- I really needed this.
- Yeah, it was nothing.
For you.
You should see Cohen with a power saw.
How do you know about the Care Bear stare?
- Dude, leave it alone.
- No, I'm just curious.
- Isn't he cute?
- It's like...
It's kind of...
I know there are billions of stars in the sky, and they're all twinkling.
I wonder what makes one star more important than another?
I mean, why does one star become part of the big dipper, and another just flame out?
Wow.
See that shooting star?
My name's Vance.
You told me that already.
Right.
I'm just a little nervous tonight.
You should be.
Is that me?
Shit!
I only took one hit.
How stupid is that?
Well, they don't call it dope for nothing.
So... what happens next?
Do I go up there?
You're asking the wrong girl.
Some people believe there's something bigger out there... that there's something protecting us,
watching over us as we change.
I guess it's comforting to think that someone is looking in on us.
Reggie.
Reggie, let's go.
Come on, come on.
Hurry up.
- Where are we going?
- Just be quiet.
Just get in the car.
Morning!
Sorry.
We--we wake you up?
What are you doing on my house?
Don't mind her, Hank.
Last to rise, first to worry.
Mother!
What are you doing?
Joy, dear, did you honestly think that I was just going to write you a check for fixing this roof without looking at it myself first?
I always warned you this house is in lousy shape.
No, you actually used to say that about my marriage.
You see?
Right on both counts.
- Hi, Reggie!
- Hi, grandma.
Come on-
- Hank, would you mind putting the bags over there?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
Well...
That man has the most amazing hindquarters.
Reggie, you need to, uh, go get ready for school.
Oh, relax, Joy.
We're all women here.
I mean it, Reggie.
Clancy had such a flat ass.
You really can't trust a man with a flat ass.
Mom.
Nothing to hold on to.
You know who has the best ass?
Derek jeter.
Tch-ka, tch-ka, tch-ka.
You--you--this-- you can't be here.
The thing is, joy, I am here.
I should've been here before, but I was respecting your wishes.
So, at the end of the day, what has that accomplished?
You not being here.
Oh.
Oh...
Here's the estimate for the roof.
- Thanks, Hank.
- Don't mention it, Phyllis.
I have an estimate!
And I'm sure it's twice as much as what Hank is going to charge you.
Face it, Joy.
You never liked to get your hands dirty.
Whereas these hands... they love the dirt.
Some repairs, you can get an estimate for... and some repairs,
you can't put a price on.
People always say, "you can't take it with you."
But try dying and then coming back, see if you don't try to hold onto something... something important.
"Where I sit, thou hast no right to stand."
That doesn't make sense.
Why would I want to stand where you sit?
So Moses just told Death to get lost, and Death just went?
That's some freeze-dried bullshit, Daisy.
Yeah, I can't see Death giving up that easily.
I don't care if it's Ghandi.
If I have a post-it, I'm taking his bony brown butt out.
See, Death didn't actually take Moses.
God kissed him.
- God kissed moses?
- Mm-hmm, when it was his time,
God kissed him, and that's how he went.
It's beautiful.
Did you get to the part where God hates Death and promises he'll banish us from heaven?
May I?
There's no place for you in here, sweetness.
I don't know what this is.
I don't understand why I don't get this one.
Say what you want about my beliefs, but I'm professional.
I'm punctual and I get the job done.
That's it, Rube.
That's the last goddamn straw.
This is fucking bullshit, that's what it is.
She's just a kid, Rube.
She can't handle it.
Fuck that!
I can handle this.
What is it?
No offense, Georgie girl, but how long have you been in this business?
A fucking year at the most?
I mean, I've worked my fucking-- worked--
It's not a negotiation.
George has got the letter.
All these fireworks?
Let's just assume that's already happened and help our young friend with her situation.
Thank you.
What's my situation?
- V.I.P.R. - "Very important person reap."
I.D.G.I.
"I don't get it."
Open it already.
Did I win a prize?
Keep going.
K. Lowerdeck?
Kyle lowerdeck, the singer?
Come on!
This has got to be some unholy fucking mess-up, because this is my reap.
I was born to do this reap.
I was put on this Earth, and in this place, der the waffle haus, to fucking do this reap.
Please don't.
I was born to be a rock star.
If I could sing.
He's cute.
He's not as cute as my first V.I.P.R.-
- James dean.
Beautiful Porsche.
These really delicate lips.
But he was so confused.
- Did he try to nail you?
- No.
I don't know why.
I do.
You.
And you.
Fine.
Okay... why don't you just get a big lead pole, and stick it right up my ass?
Same location, different reap.
You got sloppy seconds.
I'm going to be calm.
Why does she get the cool reap?
Probably because you're a fuck-up.
Congratulations, Georgia.
You've arrived.
Excuse me.
I could've been James Dean, you know, if I could act... or drive.
- You up for this?
- Yeah, sure, why not?
She's going to fuck it up.
Hey, someone thinks I'm doing a good job.
Right?
Am I right or am I right?
Okay, rich girl, breakfast is on you.
Roxy!
Roxy.
Oh...
Listen, uh...
- George is going to need help.
- She'll be fine.
Well, uh... an event like that,
probably going to have police security, right?
You can stop right there.
I'm not losing my job over this.
In case you haven't noticed, I'm a police officer.
I swore an oath.
I don't care if you donated a kidney.
What you are is a reaper.
That's the job you're not going to lose, whether you want to or not.
What if I say no?
- Say no.
- No.
All right, Reggie gets out of school at 2:30, so if you're really going to do this, I need to have--
Oh, god.
You know, mom, you can't take care of Reggie and channel Hiawatha at the same time.
Reggie isn't ready for your... version of the healing process.
Reggie is old enough to make her own decisions.
No, mother, she's not.
All right?
She's 11.
"The path of care is the one we carve for ourselves."
You've been saying that for as long as I've worn a bra, and I still have no clue what it means.
Just, please, leave Reggie out of... your hocus pocus.
Rules are the first step toward tyranny of the soul.
You're right.
The rules are just getting in the way.
Ah, that's good.
Reggie, you know all that stuff about going to school and brushing your teeth, not talking to strangers?
Just forget about all that, okay?
You can just do whatever you want.
Do you need some money for drugs?
Why are you such a freak?
Ask your grandmother.
Where's she going?
I don't know.
Your mother was never very good about sharing.
You have to take me to school.
Oh, you're not going to school today.
What am I doing?
Can you keep a secret?
I had a secret...
I had a date with a rock star... and nobody knew.
Well, well so I can die easy jesus gonna make up jesus gonna make up sweet jesus gonna make up my dying bed
Holy smoke!
What the fuck?
Sorry!
Lord, in my time of dying don't want nobody to cry...
What are you doing?
It's Lowerdeck, from "lowerdeck"-- "in all his glory."
Oh, you're a fan?
Oh, I'm a fan.
I'm a big fan.
Oh, Misty, please don't.
- Do you have any?
- I, uh... no.
Millie, um, I was wondering if you could--
Excuse me.
Are you watching tonight?
It's going to be totally live.
I know.
I'm... going.
It's impossible.
It's like one of those unplugged sessions.
No one gets in.
Well, I guess I'm lucky.
You're going to be near him, and now I'm near you.
It's no big deal, really.
I-- oh!
- I'm not a lesbian.
- Millie, we've all experimented.
- You--I haven't.
- It's not as if I didn't go to college.
- We've all put our big toe in that water.
- I really haven't.
Delores?
You know, when you're young like you are, Millie, it's easy.
Man, woman, bottom, top... sex is this big buffet, and you're just a fat man with a fork, but as you get older, it's harder to get a fork.
Okay.
Thanks.
Um, I have to leave early today.
- Another doctor's appointment?
- No.
- A.A. Meeting?
- No.
- What, then?
- A rock concert.
- Enjoy the buffet, Millie.
- Yeah.
Okay, thanks.
Bye.
I'd like to get a ticket for the Kyle Lowerdeck concert.
Sold out.
I have $500?
Oh, well, in that case... sold out.
Asshole.
That sensation you're feeling... wouldn't be the sensation of utter failure, would it?
- What are you doing here?
- I've come to save your ass.
Let's go to the concert.
- You scored tickets?
- No.
Then I'm screwed!
Seriously, I'm royally fucked.
Roxy's downstairs.
Police escort.
C ool.
- Those are mom's.
- I know.
Do you ever look at these when she's not home?
It's all right to be curious, Reggie.
Death is the biggest mystery in life.
I'd be worried about you if you weren't curious.
Have you ever been to that place, Reggie?
That place where George died?
It's an important place in her life.
It should be an important place in yours, too.
I know.
We have to find the things and the places that keep George alive.
They're everywhere.
Her--her spirit... it's all around us.
Sometimes...
I hear things.
Me, too.
Me, too.
Are these all of your cool tops?
Some of them are dirty.
You want to see those?
I loved riding in the front seat of that police cruiser.
It was my first time without handcuffs.
It's a day of firsts.
This is cute.
- Is this blood?
- No.
Brain.
Last Tuesday, that guy who took the shotgun to the face.
Daisy swore she could get it out.
Promises, promises.
I also loved the fact you were in the back seat, George.
You looked just like a perp.
You are just so pissed off that I got a rock star and you didn't.
You just wish you were me, don't you?
She's a cocky little thing, isn't she?
I'm not cocky.
I'm just cooler than you are.
I got a rock'n'roll reap.
Up yours.
There's nothing to wear to it.
My only V.I.P. Reap was Charlton Heston.
- He isn't dead.
- Yeah, but isn't he really?
Did rube get a lot of big reaps?
I bet he has.
Rube is so fucking old, he reaped Jesus.
Come on, guys, I don't see what these clothes have got to do with getting tickets to the fucking rock concert.
George is a girl.
Looking good is her ticket.
You have a police badge and a bloody gun!
And George is young and cute.
Are these all your tops?
Hey, a dead girl has got to make do with very little.
I need something racy and clingy.
- You still got that $500?
- Most of it.
- Ooh, are we going to go scalping?
- Shopping.
- And you're on your own.
- What?
I don't like your fucking attitude.
You're on your own.
You're joking!
What?
No, but-- well, I'm just--
Do you twon think I really need you to get into a rock'n'roll establishment?
No, I don't.
I was born in a rock'n'roll establishment.
I actually was.
Behind the amps, backstage.
Roxy?
I'm so viciously fucked.
- Father Matthias?
- Confession is closed.
I know, I just...
Well, it's occupied anyway.
A boy and a girl are actually desecrating the confessional.
They are fruitful and multiplying...
Are you drunk, father?
I'm sorry.
I'm not being a very good priest.
No, you certainly aren't.
I know you.
Were you here for confession a couple of weeks ago?
I was.
Were you the one who stole a cross from a dead woman?
Well, if you want to put it that way, fine.
- It's very beautiful.
- Thank you.
So are you.
Father... tsk, tsk.
Well, I've done the drinking.
And the coveting, that's a given.
But that's where I stop.
What's your name?
Daisy adair.
My parish is poor.
I've spent a lifetime trying to bring hope to the hopeless, convincing them that there's some great reward ahead.
I worry about the hearts of men, Daisy.
So do I.
Would you like to know the secrets of the universe, Daisy?
We are born.
We die.
We rot.
It's all one big cosmic joke!
Oh, my lord...
I'm with the band, mate.
Cheers.
Uh, excuse me, hello.
I'm with the band.
Why don't you understand me?
I'm... with... the... band.
What do you think Kyle's going to say when he says,
"where's my bloody guitar?"
And I say, "the fat bloody security person held me up at the gate"?
All right.
I'm friends with the drummer.
What's the drummer's name?
I call him by his nickname, you know, Sticks.
Hit the road, Jack.
Roxy, thank god, man.
Fucking--you don't know what I've been through here.
I mean, in the good old days, you used to be able to just--
- Sir, step aside.
- What?
Sir, don't let me have to ask you again.
Step aside.
Don't pull this on me, Roxy.
Don't--no, don't get your little friend to come over and arrest me or anything, because you're not going to--roxy!
You have not heard the last of this!
Don't I know it.
She's with the band.
Look, she's pretending not to know me!
You're on your own, kid.
Don't fuck this up.
Roxy, you're a bugger.
You know that dream where you're sitting in class, and all of a sudden you realize you're naked?
Well, I never had that dream.
Until now.
Hey, Don, get someone to clear the fucking step, hey?
Are you all right?
Someone's going to die around here.
I think you're right.
Hey, I'm Jeannie, and I'm going to get you a drink.
I'm George, and I'm not going to argue.
So I haven't seen you around here before.
- I'm with the network.
- Oh.
Cool.
What do you do?
Okay, you're supposed to be here, but have no responsibilities.
I'm an... intern.
Nice.
- So have you met Kyle?
- Not yet.
Well, two years ago, Kyle's biggest gig was his step-dad's garage.
He was waiting tables at the daily grill, and this fucking agent finds him.
She's a vampire.
Really has fangs.
Anyway, just like that, no one can get near him.
No one can touch him.
I need to touch him.
Yeah, well, his new girlfriend will kill you first.
I'm going to touch him tonight.
Yeah, well, George, live hard, die young, leave a fucking beautiful corpse.
Amen to that, sister.
"Amen to that, sister?"
One more.
Just like that, I was a rocker chick.
Cheers.
Excuse me.
Yoo-hoo.
The thing is,
I've got this little package for Kyle, you know, it's a performance enhancer.
If you're lucky, you can get a bit on the side--
I've been clean 15 years, lowlife.
Fuck you.
You're going to be hearing from my bloody lawyer.
Do you know what I mean?
I mean, that's going to cost you, big time.
If you give me 50 bucks now, we'll forget about the whole thing.
How much to break both your legs?
Oh, come on!
This isn't rock'n'roll.
What do you smell like?
Uh...
Oh, come on, since when does a man need to shower to be rock and roll, eh?
You smell like death.
You are not exactly a bouquet of fucking roses either, love, all right?
Oh, fuck off.
- Have a good evening, sir.
- Huh?
Sweet!
Oh, mama, I'm home.
Come on.
Bandar wants to meet you.
- What's your name?
- Mason.
When Kyle used to play, it was like... a happening, you know?
None of this manufactured crap.
Wherever he played, people would just hear about it and come, you know what I'm saying?
Sure.
Well, it's not like that anymore.
It used to be all about rock.
Now it's all about the rock star.
Yeah, um, can you introduce me now?
Mm, I think there're a few other people who want to meet you first.
What's their deal?
I believe the deal is that you're hot.
- I am?
- Yeah.
You're actually Kyle's type.
You know, that effortless cool look.
Although, you could use a little lip gloss.
Do me.
Yeah, you wish, dude.
What the hell do they think?
- Let's go check out the buffet.
- Okay.
I died in 1938.
Which interrupted a very promising career on the silver screen.
So now I stay here, and I help other people go.
And they do go somewhere, I know that much.
I don't know if there's a heaven or a hell, but I believe there's more.
My whole life... my whole death, shows me that there's more.
I just don't know what it is.
Thank you.
You can't tell anyone.
I have to, I have to tell them.
Yeah.
I know you do.
Thank you for giving me back my faith.
So... is it true?
I don't know what the hell she's talking about, Band-aid, but I do want a bit more tequila.
Do you know what I mean?
It's Bandar, motherfucker.
Look into his eyes.
He's dead.
You're dead, right?
No, man, I'm deathly attracted to you.
I'm dead on arrival at your doorstep.
I'm dead serious.
Don't you get it?
You're with friends now.
Just answer the question.
Are you dead?
I was dead.
And now I'm not.
I'm a grim reaper.
I take people's souls before they die.
I knew it.
What is it like to take someone's soul?
All right, Bandar, you know when you're piss drunk, and you collapse on the floor, and someone comes to wake you up because the police are just about to arrive, yeah?
Well, I'm that someone.
And at first, they don't know where they are or who they are, and they're a little bit confused.
Well, that's why I'm there, 'cause I'm there to...
I'm there to reassure them.
I'm there to make them believe everything's all right.
To death.
Ah... nice.
To death.
Tonight.
Thank you.
Thank you!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Who's there?
Tommy Ryan, if that's you rmaking out with Cindy Stevens again in my confessional, there'll be hell to pay!
Cindy stevens?
You asshole!
Afternoon.
Uh, we were-- we were just--
Don't lie, Tommy.
Not on this day.
This is a holy day, for I have seen something wonderful.
Now, fall to your knees and ask for his forgiveness.
Jesus, father!
Do not use his name in vain!
For he is real!
Chill, father.
You're freaking me out.
Wait!
Listen to me, I have seen something wonderful!
Tommy!
No, wait!
Wait!
Tommy!
No, wait!
Wait!
Wait, I--
So... is that all there is?
No.
This is only the start.
Look.
- Father?
- Yes?
Is it all they say it is?
I'm as curious as you are, Daisy.
I know there's a much better place out there.
If I could only figure out how to access it.
The better place out there, in my mind?
It's the V.I.P. Room.
And tonight...
I'm finally getting in.
Ready to meet Kyle?
Ready for your brush with immortality?
Yeah, a brush sounds right about now.
- Hey, Jeannie.
- Hey, Kyle.
I saw your mom.
She says hi.
Oh.
Thanks.
Um, this is George.
She's with the network.
Actually, I'm an intern.
Uh, Jenny...
- It's Jeannie.
- Yeah.
Kyle doesn't do meet-and-greets this close to performance.
Please try to respect that.
Oh...kay.
She just totally rock-blocked us.
That wasn't cool.
Well, let's blow.
I'm going to stick around a while.
He's not really immortal, you know.
You can touch him, but nothing's going to brush off on you.
It's one thing to show up, take a soul, get on with your afterlife.
You can think of yourself like some kind of... accident.
But when you have to work at it, it feels more like... murder.
Offer you a lift home?
Why, Rube, is there a gentleman lurking underneath that cold demeanor?
Where's your cross?
He's a priest, for God's sake.
I wanted golden trumpets and angels singing.
I just expected it to be far more glamorous.
There's a place in Bombay.
It's called the tower of silence.
When somebody dies, they have no more use for this body, for this vessel, so they put the body at the top of the tower and let the vultures have at it.
Our endings, Daisy... they are what they are.
Great.
So?
Find what you're looking for?
I knew we'd find you here.
What... what are you doing?
I'm bringing Reggie to visit her sister.
Reggie, did you even go to school today?
The truth, Reggie.
Mom.
We did yoga.
Oh.
Good god.
Mother, what color is the sky on your planet?
It's a very bright blue.
Oh, I can't...
I can't do this right now.
Reggie, let's go.
I've never been here before.
I want to stay.
Reggie...
She's never been here before, Joy.
All right, fine.
Let's be here.
How do I become a reaper?
How do you...
Bandar, first of all, you have to experience the inconvenience of dying.
I can do that.
Don't you think this is a bit bloody morbid, though?
It's like, I can promise you, death will find you.
You don't have to invite it in.
You're never more alive until you're closest to death.
Very, very right.
Oh, my goodness.
Get off.
Oh...
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me meet me in the middle of the air if these wings should fail me lord, won't you meet me with another pair?
That's all you guys get right now.
Well, let's have a great night, guys.
Maybe this is our time.
Maybe this is our moment.
Let's enjoy.
Cheers.
- All right!
- All right!
It's always the same, whether it's asking someone out, jumping in the water, or losing your virginity.
They always say the same thing:
just do it.
My very important problem was,
I'd never done any of those very important things.
Hi.
I'm George.
Hi.
I'm Kyle.
I was just, you know, taking a moment...
Take as many as you can.
You excited about tonight?
- Mostly nervous.
- Me too.
I mean, I don't want to disappoint them.
I've never done a live concert on T.V. before.
There's going to be a lot of people watching tonight.
I don't know why, but for some reason, I've been picked to do this.
It's crazy.
It's way too much responsibility, you know?
- You're going to be great.
- Give me luck.
You know what, guys, it has been such a treat, but I've got things to do.
Okay, I'll see you around, all right?
Wait.
No.
What is that?
You have to give that back to me, all right?
I'm going to die tonight.
And you are going to take my soul.
- What's your name?
- I am Bandar.
Your real name, stupid asshole.
It's Fred.
It's Fred Swirsky.
I'm fucking with you guys, man.
I'm not a fucking grim reaper.
Jesus christ.
I don't know where this death wish comes in, but it's stupid.
I don't think you know how stupid it is.
You need to get a life, Fred.
You all need to get some color.
Maybe a little rouge around the cheeks.
Some sunshine, all right?
You, stay chalky.
You're gorgeous.
See you.
Thank you very much, you guys.
Thanks for coming out this evening.
Now, in my time of dying
I don't want nobody to mourn all I want my friends to do comin' for my dying arms well, well, well so I can die easy well, well, well so I can die young well, well, well
So I can die easy
Jesus gonna make up
Jesus gonna make up
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed--
No, don't.
Please.
Wow.
What's this girl's name?
What is her name?
Uh, Jeannie Bead.
Fuck!
Don't... don't touch me.
- What's this?
- It's for you.
Wow.
- Does everyone get this?
- No.
Did you get this?
No, no lights for me.
Not yet.
Every day, I watch people die.
Why one death means more than another,
I have no idea.
I think people need something familiar.
Reggie?
Mom?
Something they can remember.
Whatcha doing there, Reggie?
Grandma's helping George with her bardo.
Is that right?
The bardo is the way the tibetans help the dead sort out reality.
It's an ancient and respected ritual, Joy.
Well, I brought another ancient and respected ritual.
Chunky monkey.
Reggie, why don't you go scoop us up a few bowls?
You know, you're not the only one who's lost George.
The whole world has lost a soul.
She was my daughter.
Mine.
She was me, mom.
The same way that you're me.
And I miss you.
Both of you.
You see it out there?
George did good.
She did fine.
What's going on, Rox?
I had to shoot someone.
Someone died.
- Did your job.
- Mine and Mason's.
I meant your other job... officer.
I'm just stating a fact.
Did somebody important die?
Today, every day.
What kind of pie you got tonight?
It's pecan.
I saved you a piece, for my very important customer.
- George?
- Yeah, she did really well.
I can't go in there tonight and face the boss man.
Do me a favor and... tell him I'm piss drunk somewhere in the gutter.
Don't make more of it than it is.
I won't.
Come on inside.
I'm buying.
Maybe it's easier to mourn someone you never really knew.
I'm not sure I get it, all this shared pain...
I guess it's a place to leave a sign, a way of saying that you lost someone, too.
Everyone was connecting.
Everyone, of course, except me.
Okay, Rube, I blew it.
I completely blew it, and believe me,
I'm so painfully, painfully aware of my failures this evening, but, saying that, bring on more pain, because, no doubt, I deserve it, okay?
Pecan.
Not bad, either.
Think of it as a get-out-of-jail-free card.
- Nice shot, Roxy.
- Thanks.
Here she is.
Look at you!
Nice going.
Yeah, it was crazy in there.
I like your outfit.
Thank you, Daisy.
Roxy picked it out.
Ain't nothing but woman under this uniform.
What the fuck you laughing at?
Not every death gets a candlelight vigil.
Most deaths, they just got a sky full of stars.
That's not bad... for a nobody like me.
I know there are billions of stars in the sky, and they're all twinkling.
I wonder what makes one star more important than another?
I mean, why does one star become part of the big dipper, and another just flame out?
Wow.
See that shooting star?
My name's Vance.
You told me that already.
Right.
I'm just a little nervous tonight.
You should be.
Is that me?
Shit!
I only took one hit.
How stupid is that?
Well, they don't call it dope for nothing.
So... what happens next?
Do I go up there?
You're asking the wrong girl.
Some people believe there's something bigger out there... that there's something protecting us,
watching over us as we change.
I guess it's comforting to think that someone is looking in on us.
Reggie.
Reggie, let's go.
Come on, come on.
Hurry up.
- Where are we going?
- Just be quiet.
Just get in the car.
Morning!
Sorry.
We--we wake you up?
What are you doing on my house?
Don't mind her, Hank.
Last to rise, first to worry.
Mother!
What are you doing?
Joy, dear, did you honestly think that I was just going to write you a check for fixing this roof without looking at it myself first?
I always warned you this house is in lousy shape.
No, you actually used to say that about my marriage.
You see?
Right on both counts.
- Hi, Reggie!
- Hi, grandma.
Come on-
- Hank, would you mind putting the bags over there?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
Well...
That man has the most amazing hindquarters.
Reggie, you need to, uh, go get ready for school.
Oh, relax, Joy.
We're all women here.
I mean it, Reggie.
Clancy had such a flat ass.
You really can't trust a man with a flat ass.
Mom.
Nothing to hold on to.
You know who has the best ass?
Derek jeter.
Tch-ka, tch-ka, tch-ka.
You--you--this-- you can't be here.
The thing is, joy, I am here.
I should've been here before, but I was respecting your wishes.
So, at the end of the day, what has that accomplished?
You not being here.
Oh.
Oh...
Here's the estimate for the roof.
- Thanks, Hank.
- Don't mention it, Phyllis.
I have an estimate!
And I'm sure it's twice as much as what Hank is going to charge you.
Face it, Joy.
You never liked to get your hands dirty.
Whereas these hands... they love the dirt.
Some repairs, you can get an estimate for... and some repairs,
you can't put a price on.
People always say, "you can't take it with you."
But try dying and then coming back, see if you don't try to hold onto something... something important.
"Where I sit, thou hast no right to stand."
That doesn't make sense.
Why would I want to stand where you sit?
So Moses just told Death to get lost, and Death just went?
That's some freeze-dried bullshit, Daisy.
Yeah, I can't see Death giving up that easily.
I don't care if it's Ghandi.
If I have a post-it, I'm taking his bony brown butt out.
See, Death didn't actually take Moses.
God kissed him.
- God kissed moses?
- Mm-hmm, when it was his time,
God kissed him, and that's how he went.
It's beautiful.
Did you get to the part where God hates Death and promises he'll banish us from heaven?
May I?
There's no place for you in here, sweetness.
I don't know what this is.
I don't understand why I don't get this one.
Say what you want about my beliefs, but I'm professional.
I'm punctual and I get the job done.
That's it, Rube.
That's the last goddamn straw.
This is fucking bullshit, that's what it is.
She's just a kid, Rube.
She can't handle it.
Fuck that!
I can handle this.
What is it?
No offense, Georgie girl, but how long have you been in this business?
A fucking year at the most?
I mean, I've worked my fucking-- worked--
It's not a negotiation.
George has got the letter.
All these fireworks?
Let's just assume that's already happened and help our young friend with her situation.
Thank you.
What's my situation?
- V.I.P.R. - "Very important person reap."
I.D.G.I.
"I don't get it."
Open it already.
Did I win a prize?
Keep going.
K. Lowerdeck?
Kyle lowerdeck, the singer?
Come on!
This has got to be some unholy fucking mess-up, because this is my reap.
I was born to do this reap.
I was put on this Earth, and in this place, der the waffle haus, to fucking do this reap.
Please don't.
I was born to be a rock star.
If I could sing.
He's cute.
He's not as cute as my first V.I.P.R.-
- James dean.
Beautiful Porsche.
These really delicate lips.
But he was so confused.
- Did he try to nail you?
- No.
I don't know why.
I do.
You.
And you.
Fine.
Okay... why don't you just get a big lead pole, and stick it right up my ass?
Same location, different reap.
You got sloppy seconds.
I'm going to be calm.
Why does she get the cool reap?
Probably because you're a fuck-up.
Congratulations, Georgia.
You've arrived.
Excuse me.
I could've been James Dean, you know, if I could act... or drive.
- You up for this?
- Yeah, sure, why not?
She's going to fuck it up.
Hey, someone thinks I'm doing a good job.
Right?
Am I right or am I right?
Okay, rich girl, breakfast is on you.
Roxy!
Roxy.
Oh...
Listen, uh...
- George is going to need help.
- She'll be fine.
Well, uh... an event like that,
probably going to have police security, right?
You can stop right there.
I'm not losing my job over this.
In case you haven't noticed, I'm a police officer.
I swore an oath.
I don't care if you donated a kidney.
What you are is a reaper.
That's the job you're not going to lose, whether you want to or not.
What if I say no?
- Say no.
- No.
All right, Reggie gets out of school at 2:30, so if you're really going to do this, I need to have--
Oh, god.
You know, mom, you can't take care of Reggie and channel Hiawatha at the same time.
Reggie isn't ready for your... version of the healing process.
Reggie is old enough to make her own decisions.
No, mother, she's not.
All right?
She's 11.
"The path of care is the one we carve for ourselves."
You've been saying that for as long as I've worn a bra, and I still have no clue what it means.
Just, please, leave Reggie out of... your hocus pocus.
Rules are the first step toward tyranny of the soul.
You're right.
The rules are just getting in the way.
Ah, that's good.
Reggie, you know all that stuff about going to school and brushing your teeth, not talking to strangers?
Just forget about all that, okay?
You can just do whatever you want.
Do you need some money for drugs?
Why are you such a freak?
Ask your grandmother.
Where's she going?
I don't know.
Your mother was never very good about sharing.
You have to take me to school.
Oh, you're not going to school today.
What am I doing?
Can you keep a secret?
I had a secret...
I had a date with a rock star... and nobody knew.
Well, well so I can die easy jesus gonna make up jesus gonna make up sweet jesus gonna make up my dying bed
Holy smoke!
What the fuck?
Sorry!
Lord, in my time of dying don't want nobody to cry...
What are you doing?
It's Lowerdeck, from "lowerdeck"-- "in all his glory."
Oh, you're a fan?
Oh, I'm a fan.
I'm a big fan.
Oh, Misty, please don't.
- Do you have any?
- I, uh... no.
Millie, um, I was wondering if you could--
Excuse me.
Are you watching tonight?
It's going to be totally live.
I know.
I'm... going.
It's impossible.
It's like one of those unplugged sessions.
No one gets in.
Well, I guess I'm lucky.
You're going to be near him, and now I'm near you.
It's no big deal, really.
I-- oh!
- I'm not a lesbian.
- Millie, we've all experimented.
- You--I haven't.
- It's not as if I didn't go to college.
- We've all put our big toe in that water.
- I really haven't.
Delores?
You know, when you're young like you are, Millie, it's easy.
Man, woman, bottom, top... sex is this big buffet, and you're just a fat man with a fork, but as you get older, it's harder to get a fork.
Okay.
Thanks.
Um, I have to leave early today.
- Another doctor's appointment?
- No.
- A.A. Meeting?
- No.
- What, then?
- A rock concert.
- Enjoy the buffet, Millie.
- Yeah.
Okay, thanks.
Bye.
I'd like to get a ticket for the Kyle Lowerdeck concert.
Sold out.
I have $500?
Oh, well, in that case... sold out.
Asshole.
That sensation you're feeling... wouldn't be the sensation of utter failure, would it?
- What are you doing here?
- I've come to save your ass.
Let's go to the concert.
- You scored tickets?
- No.
Then I'm screwed!
Seriously, I'm royally fucked.
Roxy's downstairs.
Police escort.
Cool.
- Those are mom's.
- I know.
Do you ever look at these when she's not home?
It's all right to be curious, Reggie.
Death is the biggest mystery in life.
I'd be worried about you if you weren't curious.
Have you ever been to that place, Reggie?
That place where George died?
It's an important place in her life.
It should be an important place in yours, too.
I know.
We have to find the things and the places that keep George alive.
They're everywhere.
Her--her spirit... it's all around us.
Sometimes...
I hear things.
Me, too.
Me, too.
Are these all of your cool tops?
Some of them are dirty.
You want to see those?
I loved riding in the front seat of that police cruiser.
It was my first time without handcuffs.
It's a day of firsts.
This is cute.
- Is this blood?
- No.
Brain.
Last Tuesday, that guy who took the shotgun to the face.
Daisy swore she could get it out.
Promises, promises.
I also loved the fact you were in the back seat, George.
You looked just like a perp.
You are just so pissed off that I got a rock star and you didn't.
You just wish you were me, don't you?
She's a cocky little thing, isn't she?
I'm not cocky.
I'm just cooler than you are.
I got a rock'n'roll reap.
Up yours.
There's nothing to wear to it.
My only V.I.P. Reap was Charlton Heston.
- He isn't dead.
- Yeah, but isn't he really?
Did rube get a lot of big reaps?
I bet he has.
Rube is so fucking old, he reaped Jesus.
Come on, guys, I don't see what these clothes have got to do with getting tickets to the fucking rock concert.
George is a girl.
Looking good is her ticket.
You have a police badge and a bloody gun!
And George is young and cute.
Are these all your tops?
Hey, a dead girl has got to make do with very little.
I need something racy and clingy.
- You still got that $500?
- Most of it.
- Ooh, are we going to go scalping?
- Shopping.
- And you're on your own.
- What?
I don't like your fucking attitude.
You're on your own.
You're joking!
What?
No, but-- well, I'm just--
Do you twon think I really need you to get into a rock'n'roll establishment?
No, I don't.
I was born in a rock'n'roll establishment.
I actually was.
Behind the amps, backstage.
Roxy?
I'm so viciously fucked.
- Father Matthias?
- Confession is closed.
I know, I just...
Well, it's occupied anyway.
A boy and a girl are actually desecrating the confessional.
They are fruitful and multiplying...
Are you drunk, father?
I'm sorry.
I'm not being a very good priest.
No, you certainly aren't.
I know you.
Were you here for confession a couple of weeks ago?
I was.
Were you the one who stole a cross from a dead woman?
Well, if you want to put it that way, fine.
- It's very beautiful.
- Thank you.
So are you.
Father... tsk, tsk.
Well, I've done the drinking.
And the coveting, that's a given.
But that's where I stop.
What's your name?
Daisy adair.
My parish is poor.
I've spent a lifetime trying to bring hope to the hopeless, convincing them that there's some great reward ahead.
I worry about the hearts of men, Daisy.
So do I.
Would you like to know the secrets of the universe, Daisy?
We are born.
We die.
We rot.
It's all one big cosmic joke!
Oh, my lord...
I'm with the band, mate.
Cheers.
Uh, excuse me, hello.
I'm with the band.
Why don't you understand me?
I'm... with... the... band.
What do you think Kyle's going to say when he says,
"where's my bloody guitar?"
And I say, "the fat bloody security person held me up at the gate"?
All right.
I'm friends with the drummer.
What's the drummer's name?
I call him by his nickname, you know, Sticks.
Hit the road, Jack.
Roxy, thank god, man.
Fucking--you don't know what I've been through here.
I mean, in the good old days, you used to be able to just--
- Sir, step aside.
- What?
Sir, don't let me have to ask you again.
Step aside.
Don't pull this on me, Roxy.
Don't--no, don't get your little friend to come over and arrest me or anything, because you're not going to--roxy!
You have not heard the last of this!
Don't I know it.
She's with the band.
Look, she's pretending not to know me!
You're on your own, kid.
Don't fuck this up.
Roxy, you're a bugger.
You know that dream where you're sitting in class, and all of a sudden you realize you're naked?
Well, I never had that dream.
Until now.
Hey, Don, get someone to clear the fucking step, hey?
Are you all right?
Someone's going to die around here.
I think you're right.
Hey, I'm Jeannie, and I'm going to get you a drink.
I'm George, and I'm not going to argue.
So I haven't seen you around here before.
- I'm with the network.
- Oh.
Cool.
What do you do?
Okay, you're supposed to be here, but have no responsibilities.
I'm an... intern.
Nice.
- So have you met Kyle?
- Not yet.
Well, two years ago, Kyle's biggest gig was his step-dad's garage.
He was waiting tables at the daily grill, and this fucking agent finds him.
She's a vampire.
Really has fangs.
Anyway, just like that, no one can get near him.
No one can touch him.
I need to touch him.
Yeah, well, his new girlfriend will kill you first.
I'm going to touch him tonight.
Yeah, well, George, live hard, die young, leave a fucking beautiful corpse.
Amen to that, sister.
"Amen to that, sister?"
One more.
Just like that, I was a rocker chick.
Cheers.
Excuse me.
Yoo-hoo.
The thing is,
I've got this little package for Kyle, you know, it's a performance enhancer.
If you're lucky, you can get a bit on the side--
I've been clean 15 years, lowlife.
Fuck you.
You're going to be hearing from my bloody lawyer.
Do you know what I mean?
I mean, that's going to cost you, big time.
If you give me 50 bucks now, we'll forget about the whole thing.
How much to break both your legs?
Oh, come on!
This isn't rock'n'roll.
What do you smell like?
Uh...
Oh, come on, since when does a man need to shower to be rock and roll, eh?
You smell like death.
You are not exactly a bouquet of fucking roses either, love, all right?
Oh, fuck off.
- Have a good evening, sir.
- Huh?
Sweet!
Oh, mama, I'm home.
Come on.
Bandar wants to meet you.
- What's your name?
- Mason.
When Kyle used to play, it was like... a happening, you know?
None of this manufactured crap.
Wherever he played, people would just hear about it and come, you know what I'm saying?
Sure.
Well, it's not like that anymore.
It used to be all about rock.
Now it's all about the rock star.
Yeah, um, can you introduce me now?
Mm, I think there're a few other people who want to meet you first.
What's their deal?
I believe the deal is that you're hot.
- I am?
- Yeah.
You're actually Kyle's type.
You know, that effortless cool look.
Although, you could use a little lip gloss.
Do me.
Yeah, you wish, dude.
What the hell do they think?
- Let's go check out the buffet.
- Okay.
I died in 1938.
Which interrupted a very promising career on the silver screen.
So now I stay here, and I help other people go.
And they do go somewhere, I know that much.
I don't know if there's a heaven or a hell, but I believe there's more.
My whole life... my whole death, shows me that there's more.
I just don't know what it is.
Thank you.
You can't tell anyone.
I have to, I have to tell them.
Yeah.
I know you do.
Thank you for giving me back my faith.
So... is it true?
I don't know what the hell she's talking about, Band-aid, but I do want a bit more tequila.
Do you know what I mean?
It's Bandar, motherfucker.
Look into his eyes.
He's dead.
You're dead, right?
No, man, I'm deathly attracted to you.
I'm dead on arrival at your doorstep.
I'm dead serious.
Don't you get it?
You're with friends now.
Just answer the question.
Are you dead?
I was dead.
And now I'm not.
I'm a grim reaper.
I take people's souls before they die.
I knew it.
What is it like to take someone's soul?
All right, Bandar, you know when you're piss drunk, and you collapse on the floor, and someone comes to wake you up because the police are just about to arrive, yeah?
Well, I'm that someone.
And at first, they don't know where they are or who they are, and they're a little bit confused.
Well, that's why I'm there, 'cause I'm there to...
I'm there to reassure them.
I'm there to make them believe everything's all right.
To death.
Ah... nice.
To death.
Tonight.
Thank you.
Thank you!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Who's there?
Tommy Ryan, if that's you rmaking out with Cindy Stevens again in my confessional, there'll be hell to pay!
Cindy stevens?
You asshole!
Afternoon.
Uh, we were-- we were just--
Don't lie, Tommy.
Not on this day.
This is a holy day, for I have seen something wonderful.
Now, fall to your knees and ask for his forgiveness.
Jesus, father!
Do not use his name in vain!
For he is real!
Chill, father.
You're freaking me out.
Wait!
Listen to me, I have seen something wonderful!
Tommy!
No, wait!
Wait!
Tommy!
No, wait!
Wait!
Wait, I--
So... is that all there is?
No.
This is only the start.
Look.
- Father?
- Yes?
Is it all they say it is?
I'm as curious as you are, Daisy.
I know there's a much better place out there.
If I could only figure out how to access it.
The better place out there, in my mind?
It's the V.I.P. Room.
And tonight...
I'm finally getting in.
Ready to meet Kyle?
Ready for your brush with immortality?
Yeah, a brush sounds right about now.
- Hey, Jeannie.
- Hey, Kyle.
I saw your mom.
She says hi.
Oh.
Thanks.
Um, this is George.
She's with the network.
Actually, I'm an intern.
Uh, Jenny...
- It's Jeannie.
- Yeah.
Kyle doesn't do meet-and-greets this close to performance.
Please try to respect that.
Oh...kay.
She just totally rock-blocked us.
That wasn't cool.
Well, let's blow.
I'm going to stick around a while.
He's not really immortal, you know.
You can touch him, but nothing's going to brush off on you.
It's one thing to show up, take a soul, get on with your afterlife.
You can think of yourself like some kind of... accident.
But when you have to work at it, it feels more like... murder.
Offer you a lift home?
Why, Rube, is there a gentleman lurking underneath that cold demeanor?
Where's your cross?
He's a priest, for God's sake.
I wanted golden trumpets and angels singing.
I just expected it to be far more glamorous.
There's a place in Bombay.
It's called the tower of silence.
When somebody dies, they have no more use for this body, for this vessel, so they put the body at the top of the tower and let the vultures have at it.
Our endings, Daisy... they are what they are.
Great.
So?
Find what you're looking for?
I knew we'd find you here.
What... what are you doing?
I'm bringing Reggie to visit her sister.
Reggie, did you even go to school today?
The truth, Reggie.
Mom.
We did yoga.
Oh.
Good god.
Mother, what color is the sky on your planet?
It's a very bright blue.
Oh, I can't...
I can't do this right now.
Reggie, let's go.
I've never been here before.
I want to stay.
Reggie...
She's never been here before, Joy.
All right, fine.
Let's be here.
How do I become a reaper?
How do you...
Bandar, first of all, you have to experience the inconvenience of dying.
I can do that.
Don't you think this is a bit bloody morbid, though?
It's like, I can promise you, death will find you.
You don't have to invite it in.
You're never more alive until you're closest to death.
Very, very right.
Oh, my goodness.
Get off.
Oh...
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me meet me in the middle of the air if these wings should fail me lord, won't you meet me with another pair?
That's all you guys get right now.
Well, let's have a great night, guys.
Maybe this is our time.
Maybe this is our moment.
Let's enjoy.
Cheers.
- All right!
- All right!
It's always the same, whether it's asking someone out, jumping in the water, or losing your virginity.
They always say the same thing:
just do it.
My very important problem was,
I'd never done any of those very important things.
Hi.
I'm George.
Hi.
I'm Kyle.
I was just, you know, taking a moment...
Take as many as you can.
You excited about tonight?
- Mostly nervous.
- Me too.
I mean, I don't want to disappoint them.
I've never done a live concert on T.V. before.
There's going to be a lot of people watching tonight.
I don't know why, but for some reason, I've been picked to do this.
It's crazy.
It's way too much responsibility, you know?
- You're going to be great.
- Give me luck.
You know what, guys, it has been such a treat, but I've got things to do.
Okay, I'll see you around, all right?
Wait.
No.
What is that?
You have to give that back to me, all right?
I'm going to die tonight.
And you are going to take my soul.
- What's your name?
- I am Bandar.
Your real name, stupid asshole.
It's Fred.
It's Fred Swirsky.
I'm fucking with you guys, man.
I'm not a fucking grim reaper.
Jesus christ.
I don't know where this death wish comes in, but it's stupid.
I don't think you know how stupid it is.
You need to get a life, Fred.
You all need to get some color.
Maybe a little rouge around the cheeks.
Some sunshine, all right?
You, stay chalky.
You're gorgeous.
See you.
Thank you very much, you guys.
Thanks for coming out this evening.
Now, in my time of dying
I don't want nobody to mourn all I want my friends to do comin' for my dying arms well, well, well so I can die easy well, well, well so I can die young well, well, well
So I can die easy
Jesus gonna make up
Jesus gonna make up
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed--
No, don't.
Please.
Wow.
What's this girl's name?
What is her name?
Uh, Jeannie Bead.
Fuck!
Don't... don't touch me.
- What's this?
- It's for you.
Wow.
- Does everyone get this?
- No.
Did you get this?
No, no lights for me.
Not yet.
Every day, I watch people die.
Why one death means more than another,
I have no idea.
I think people need something familiar.
Reggie?
Mom?
Something they can remember.
Whatcha doing there, Reggie?
Grandma's helping George with her bardo.
Is that right?
The bardo is the way the tibetans help the dead sort out reality.
It's an ancient and respected ritual, Joy.
Well, I brought another ancient and respected ritual.
Chunky monkey.
Reggie, why don't you go scoop us up a few bowls?
You know, you're not the only one who's lost George.
The whole world has lost a soul.
She was my daughter.
Mine.
She was me, mom.
The same way that you're me.
And I miss you.
Both of you.
You see it out there?
George did good.
She did fine.
What's going on, Rox?
I had to shoot someone.
Someone died.
- Did your job.
- Mine and Mason's.
I meant your other job... officer.
I'm just stating a fact.
Did somebody important die?
Today, every day.
What kind of pie you got tonight?
It's pecan.
I saved you a piece, for my very important customer.
- George?
- Yeah, she did really well.
I can't go in there tonight and face the boss man.
Do me a favor and... tell him I'm piss drunk somewhere in the gutter.
Don't make more of it than it is.
I won't.
Come on inside.
I'm buying.
Maybe it's easier to mourn someone you never really knew.
I'm not sure I get it, all this shared pain...
I guess it's a place to leave a sign, a way of saying that you lost someone, too.
Everyone was connecting.
Everyone, of course, except me.
Okay, Rube, I blew it.
I completely blew it, and believe me,
I'm so painfully, painfully aware of my failures this evening, but, saying that, bring on more pain, because, no doubt, I deserve it, okay?
Pecan.
Not bad, either.
Think of it as a get-out-of-jail-free card.
- Nice shot, Roxy.
- Thanks.
Here she is.
Look at you!
Nice going.
Yeah, it was crazy in there.
I like your outfit.
Thank you, Daisy.
Roxy picked it out.
Ain't nothing but woman under this uniform.
What the fuck you laughing at?
Not every death gets a candlelight vigil.
Most deaths, they just got a sky full of stars.
That's not bad... for a nobody like me.
I know there are billions of stars in the sky, and they're all twinkling.
I wonder what makes one star more important than another?
I mean, why does one star become part of the big dipper, and another just flame out?
Wow.
See that shooting star?
My name's Vance.
You told me that already.
Right.
I'm just a little nervous tonight.
You should be.
Is that me?
Shit!
I only took one hit.
How stupid is that?
Well, they don't call it dope for nothing.
So... what happens next?
Do I go up there?
You're asking the wrong girl.
Some people believe there's something bigger out there... that there's something protecting us,
watching over us as we change.
I guess it's comforting to think that someone is looking in on us.
Reggie.
Reggie, let's go.
Come on, come on.
Hurry up.
- Where are we going?
- Just be quiet.
Just get in the car.
Morning!
Sorry.
We--we wake you up?
What are you doing on my house?
Don't mind her, Hank.
Last to rise, first to worry.
Mother!
What are you doing?
Joy, dear, did you honestly think that I was just going to write you a check for fixing this roof without looking at it myself first?
I always warned you this house is in lousy shape.
No, you actually used to say that about my marriage.
You see?
Right on both counts.
- Hi, Reggie!
- Hi, grandma.
Come on-
- Hank, would you mind putting the bags over there?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
Well...
That man has the most amazing hindquarters.
Reggie, you need to, uh, go get ready for school.
Oh, relax, Joy.
We're all women here.
I mean it, Reggie.
Clancy had such a flat ass.
You really can't trust a man with a flat ass.
Mom.
Nothing to hold on to.
You know who has the best ass?
Derek jeter.
Tch-ka, tch-ka, tch-ka.
You--you--this-- you can't be here.
The thing is, joy, I am here.
I should've been here before, but I was respecting your wishes.
So, at the end of the day, what has that accomplished?
You not being here.
Oh.
Oh...
Here's the estimate for the roof.
- Thanks, Hank.
- Don't mention it, Phyllis.
I have an estimate!
And I'm sure it's twice as much as what Hank is going to charge you.
Face it, Joy.
You never liked to get your hands dirty.
Whereas these hands...
they love the dirt.
Some repairs, you can get an estimate for... and some repairs,
you can't put a price on.
People always say, "you can't take it with you."
But try dying and then coming back, see if you don't try to hold onto something... something important.
"Where I sit, thou hast no right to stand."
That doesn't make sense.
Why would I want to stand where you sit?
So Moses just told Death to get lost, and Death just went?
That's some freeze-dried bullshit, Daisy.
Yeah, I can't see Death giving up that easily.
I don't care if it's Ghandi.
If I have a post-it, I'm taking his bony brown butt out.
See, Death didn't actually take Moses.
God kissed him.
- God kissed moses?
- Mm-hmm, when it was his time,
God kissed him, and that's how he went.
It's beautiful.
Did you get to the part where God hates Death and promises he'll banish us from heaven?
May I?
There's no place for you in here, sweetness.
I don't know what this is.
I don't understand why I don't get this one.
Say what you want about my beliefs, but I'm professional.
I'm punctual and I get the job done.
That's it, Rube.
That's the last goddamn straw.
This is fucking bullshit, that's what it is.
She's just a kid, Rube.
She can't handle it.
Fuck that!
I can handle this.
What is it?
No offense, Georgie girl, but how long have you been in this business?
A fucking year at the most?
I mean, I've worked my fucking-- worked--
It's not a negotiation.
George has got the letter.
All these fireworks?
Let's just assume that's already happened and help our young friend with her situation.
Thank you.
What's my situation?
- V.I.P.R. - "Very important person reap."
I.D.G.I.
"I don't get it."
Open it already.
Did I win a prize?
Keep going.
K. Lowerdeck?
Kyle lowerdeck, the singer?
Come on!
This has got to be some unholy fucking mess-up, because this is my reap.
I was born to do this reap.
I was put on this Earth, and in this place, der the waffle haus, to fucking do this reap.
Please don't.
I was born to be a rock star.
If I could sing.
He's cute.
He's not as cute as my first V.I.P.R.-
- James dean.
Beautiful Porsche.
These really delicate lips.
But he was so confused.
- Did he try to nail you?
- No.
I don't know why.
I do.
You.
And you.
Fine.
Okay... why don't you just get a big lead pole, and stick it right up my ass?
Same location, different reap.
You got sloppy seconds.
I'm going to be calm.
Why does she get the cool reap?
Probably because you're a fuck-up.
Congratulations, Georgia.
You've arrived.
Excuse me.
I could've been James Dean, you know, if I could act... or drive.
- You up for this?
- Yeah, sure, why not?
She's going to fuck it up.
Hey, someone thinks I'm doing a good job.
Right?
Am I right or am I right?
Okay, rich girl, breakfast is on you.
Roxy!
Roxy.
Oh...
Listen, uh...
- George is going to need help.
- She'll be fine.
Well, uh... an event like that,
probably going to have police security, right?
You can stop right there.
I'm not losing my job over this.
In case you haven't noticed, I'm a police officer.
I swore an oath.
I don't care if you donated a kidney.
What you are is a reaper.
That's the job you're not going to lose, whether you want to or not.
What if I say no?
- Say no.
- No.
All right, Reggie gets out of school at 2:30, so if you're really going to do this, I need to have--
Oh, god.
You know, mom, you can't take care of Reggie and channel Hiawatha at the same time.
Reggie isn't ready for your... version of the healing process.
Reggie is old enough to make her own decisions.
No, mother, she's not.
All right?
She's 11.
"The path of care is the one we carve for ourselves."
You've been saying that for as long as I've worn a bra, and I still have no clue what it means.
Just, please, leave Reggie out of... your hocus pocus.
Rules are the first step toward tyranny of the soul.
You're right.
The rules are just getting in the way.
Ah, that's good.
Reggie, you know all that stuff about going to school and brushing your teeth, not talking to strangers?
Just forget about all that, okay?
You can just do whatever you want.
Do you need some money for drugs?
Why are you such a freak?
Ask your grandmother.
Where's she going?
I don't know.
Your mother was never very good about sharing.
You have to take me to school.
Oh, you're not going to school today.
What am I doing?
Can you keep a secret?
I had a secret...
I had a date with a rock star... and nobody knew.
Well, well so I can die easy jesus gonna make up jesus gonna make up sweet jesus gonna make up my dying bed
Holy smoke!
What the fuck?
Sorry!
Lord, in my time of dying don't want nobody to cry...
What are you doing?
It's Lowerdeck, from "lowerdeck"-- "in all his glory."
Oh, you're a fan?
Oh, I'm a fan.
I'm a big fan.
Oh, Misty, please don't.
- Do you have any?
- I, uh... no.
Millie, um, I was wondering if you could--
Excuse me.
Are you watching tonight?
It's going to be totally live.
I know.
I'm... going.
It's impossible.
It's like one of those unplugged sessions.
No one gets in.
Well, I guess I'm lucky.
You're going to be near him, and now I'm near you.
It's no big deal, really.
I-- oh!
- I'm not a lesbian.
- Millie, we've all experimented.
- You--I haven't.
- It's not as if I didn't go to college.
- We've all put our big toe in that water.
- I really haven't.
Delores?
You know, when you're young like you are, Millie, it's easy.
Man, woman, bottom, top... sex is this big buffet, and you're just a fat man with a fork, but as you get older, it's harder to get a fork.
Okay.
Thanks.
Um, I have to leave early today.
- Another doctor's appointment?
- No.
- A.A. Meeting?
- No.
- What, then?
- A rock concert.
- Enjoy the buffet, Millie.
- Yeah.
Okay, thanks.
Bye.
I'd like to get a ticket for the Kyle Lowerdeck concert.
Sold out.
I have $500?
Oh, well, in that case... sold out.
Asshole.
That sensation you're feeling... wouldn't be the sensation of utter failure, would it?
- What are you doing here?
- I've come to save your ass.
Let's go to the concert.
- You scored tickets?
- No.
Then I'm screwed!
Seriously, I'm royally fucked.
Roxy's downstairs.
Police escort.
C ool.
- Those are mom's.
- I know.
Do you ever look at these when she's not home?
It's all right to be curious, Reggie.
Death is the biggest mystery in life.
I'd be worried about you if you weren't curious.
Have you ever been to that place, Reggie?
That place where George died?
It's an important place in her life.
It should be an important place in yours, too.
I know.
We have to find the things and the places that keep George alive.
They're everywhere.
Her--her spirit... it's all around us.
Sometimes...
I hear things.
Me, too.
Me, too.
Are these all of your cool tops?
Some of them are dirty.
You want to see those?
I loved riding in the front seat of that police cruiser.
It was my first time without handcuffs.
It's a day of firsts.
This is cute.
- Is this blood?
- No.
Brain.
Last Tuesday, that guy who took the shotgun to the face.
Daisy swore she could get it out.
Promises, promises.
I also loved the fact you were in the back seat, George.
You looked just like a perp.
You are just so pissed off that I got a rock star and you didn't.
You just wish you were me, don't you?
She's a cocky little thing, isn't she?
I'm not cocky.
I'm just cooler than you are.
I got a rock'n'roll reap.
Up yours.
There's nothing to wear to it.
My only V.I.P. Reap was Charlton Heston.
- He isn't dead.
- Yeah, but isn't he really?
Did rube get a lot of big reaps?
I bet he has.
Rube is so fucking old, he reaped Jesus.
Come on, guys, I don't see what these clothes have got to do with getting tickets to the fucking rock concert.
George is a girl.
Looking good is her ticket.
You have a police badge and a bloody gun!
And George is young and cute.
Are these all your tops?
Hey, a dead girl has got to make do with very little.
I need something racy and clingy.
- You still got that $500?
- Most of it.
- Ooh, are we going to go scalping?
- Shopping.
- And you're on your own.
- What?
I don't like your fucking attitude.
You're on your own.
You're joking!
What?
No, but-- well, I'm just--
Do you twon think I really need you to get into a rock'n'roll establishment?
No, I don't.
I was born in a rock'n'roll establishment.
I actually was.
Behind the amps, backstage.
Roxy?
I'm so viciously fucked.
- Father Matthias?
- Confession is closed.
I know, I just...
Well, it's occupied anyway.
A boy and a girl are actually desecrating the confessional.
They are fruitful and multiplying...
Are you drunk, father?
I'm sorry.
I'm not being a very good priest.
No, you certainly aren't.
I know you.
Were you here for confession a couple of weeks ago?
I was.
Were you the one who stole a cross from a dead woman?
Well, if you want to put it that way, fine.
- It's very beautiful.
- Thank you.
So are you.
Father... tsk, tsk.
Well, I've done the drinking.
And the coveting, that's a given.
But that's where I stop.
What's your name?
Daisy adair.
My parish is poor.
I've spent a lifetime trying to bring hope to the hopeless, convincing them that there's some great reward ahead.
I worry about the hearts of men, Daisy.
So do I.
Would you like to know the secrets of the universe, Daisy?
We are born.
We die.
We rot.
It's all one big cosmic joke!
Oh, my lord...
I'm with the band, mate.
Cheers.
Uh, excuse me, hello.
I'm with the band.
Why don't you understand me?
I'm... with... the... band.
What do you think Kyle's going to say when he says,
"where's my bloody guitar?"
And I say, "the fat bloody security person held me up at the gate"?
All right.
I'm friends with the drummer.
What's the drummer's name?
I call him by his nickname, you know, Sticks.
Hit the road, Jack.
Roxy, thank god, man.
Fucking--you don't know what I've been through here.
I mean, in the good old days, you used to be able to just--
- Sir, step aside.
- What?
Sir, don't let me have to ask you again.
Step aside.
Don't pull this on me, Roxy.
Don't--no, don't get your little friend to come over and arrest me or anything, because you're not going to--roxy!
You have not heard the last of this!
Don't I know it.
She's with the band.
Look, she's pretending not to know me!
You're on your own, kid.
Don't fuck this up.
Roxy, you're a bugger.
You know that dream where you're sitting in class, and all of a sudden you realize you're naked?
Well, I never had that dream.
Until now.
Hey, Don, get someone to clear the fucking step, hey?
Are you all right?
Someone's going to die around here.
I think you're right.
Hey, I'm Jeannie, and I'm going to get you a drink.
I'm George, and I'm not going to argue.
So I haven't seen you around here before.
- I'm with the network.
- Oh.
Cool.
What do you do?
Okay, you're supposed to be here, but have no responsibilities.
I'm an... intern.
Nice.
- So have you met Kyle?
- Not yet.
Well, two years ago, Kyle's biggest gig was his step-dad's garage.
He was waiting tables at the daily grill, and this fucking agent finds him.
She's a vampire.
Really has fangs.
Anyway, just like that, no one can get near him.
No one can touch him.
I need to touch him.
Yeah, well, his new girlfriend will kill you first.
I'm going to touch him tonight.
Yeah, well, George, live hard, die young, leave a fucking beautiful corpse.
Amen to that, sister.
"Amen to that, sister?"
One more.
Just like that, I was a rocker chick.
Cheers.
Excuse me.
Yoo-hoo.
The thing is,
I've got this little package for Kyle, you know, it's a performance enhancer.
If you're lucky, you can get a bit on the side--
I've been clean 15 years, lowlife.
Fuck you.
You're going to be hearing from my bloody lawyer.
Do you know what I mean?
I mean, that's going to cost you, big time.
If you give me 50 bucks now, we'll forget about the whole thing.
How much to break both your legs?
Oh, come on!
This isn't rock'n'roll.
What do you smell like?
Uh...
Oh, come on, since when does a man need to shower to be rock and roll, eh?
You smell like death.
You are not exactly a bouquet of fucking roses either, love, all right?
Oh, fuck off.
- Have a good evening, sir.
- Huh?
Sweet!
Oh, mama, I'm home.
Come on.
Bandar wants to meet you.
- What's your name?
- Mason.
When Kyle used to play, it was like... a happening, you know?
None of this manufactured crap.
Wherever he played, people would just hear about it and come, you know what I'm saying?
Sure.
Well, it's not like that anymore.
It used to be all about rock.
Now it's all about the rock star.
Yeah, um, can you introduce me now?
Mm, I think there're a few other people who want to meet you first.
What's their deal?
I believe the deal is that you're hot.
- I am?
- Yeah.
You're actually Kyle's type.
You know, that effortless cool look.
Although, you could use a little lip gloss.
Do me.
Yeah, you wish, dude.
What the hell do they think?
- Let's go check out the buffet.
- Okay.
I died in 1938.
Which interrupted a very promising career on the silver screen.
So now I stay here, and I help other people go.
And they do go somewhere, I know that much.
I don't know if there's a heaven or a hell, but I believe there's more.
My whole life... my whole death, shows me that there's more.
I just don't know what it is.
Thank you.
You can't tell anyone.
I have to, I have to tell them.
Yeah.
I know you do.
Thank you for giving me back my faith.
So... is it true?
I don't know what the hell she's talking about, Band-aid, but I do want a bit more tequila.
Do you know what I mean?
It's Bandar, motherfucker.
Look into his eyes.
He's dead.
You're dead, right?
No, man, I'm deathly attracted to you.
I'm dead on arrival at your doorstep.
I'm dead serious.
Don't you get it?
You're with friends now.
Just answer the question.
Are you dead?
I was dead.
And now I'm not.
I'm a grim reaper.
I take people's souls before they die.
I knew it.
What is it like to take someone's soul?
All right, Bandar, you know when you're piss drunk, and you collapse on the floor, and someone comes to wake you up because the police are just about to arrive, yeah?
Well, I'm that someone.
And at first, they don't know where they are or who they are, and they're a little bit confused.
Well, that's why I'm there, 'cause I'm there to...
I'm there to reassure them.
I'm there to make them believe everything's all right.
To death.
Ah... nice.
To death.
Tonight.
Thank you.
Thank you!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Who's there?
Tommy Ryan, if that's you rmaking out with Cindy Stevens again in my confessional, there'll be hell to pay!
Cindy stevens?
You asshole!
Afternoon.
Uh, we were-- we were just--
Don't lie, Tommy.
Not on this day.
This is a holy day, for I have seen something wonderful.
Now, fall to your knees and ask for his forgiveness.
Jesus, father!
Do not use his name in vain!
For he is real!
Chill, father.
You're freaking me out.
Wait!
Listen to me, I have seen something wonderful!
Tommy!
No, wait!
Wait!
Tommy!
No, wait!
Wait!
Wait, I--
So... is that all there is?
No.
This is only the start.
Look.
- Father?
- Yes?
Is it all they say it is?
I'm as curious as you are, Daisy.
I know there's a much better place out there.
If I could only figure out how to access it.
The better place out there, in my mind?
It's the V.I.P. Room.
And tonight...
I'm finally getting in.
Ready to meet Kyle?
Ready for your brush with immortality?
Yeah, a brush sounds right about now.
- Hey, Jeannie.
- Hey, Kyle.
I saw your mom.
She says hi.
Oh.
Thanks.
Um, this is George.
She's with the network.
Actually, I'm an intern.
Uh, Jenny...
- It's Jeannie.
- Yeah.
Kyle doesn't do meet-and-greets this close to performance.
Please try to respect that.
Oh...kay.
She just totally rock-blocked us.
That wasn't cool.
Well, let's blow.
I'm going to stick around a while.
He's not really immortal, you know.
You can touch him, but nothing's going to brush off on you.
It's one thing to show up, take a soul, get on with your afterlife.
You can think of yourself like some kind of... accident.
But when you have to work at it, it feels more like... murder.
Offer you a lift home?
Why, Rube, is there a gentleman lurking underneath that cold demeanor?
Where's your cross?
He's a priest, for God's sake.
I wanted golden trumpets and angels singing.
I just expected it to be far more glamorous.
There's a place in Bombay.
It's called the tower of silence.
When somebody dies, they have no more use for this body, for this vessel, so they put the body at the top of the tower and let the vultures have at it.
Our endings, Daisy... they are what they are.
Great.
So?
Find what you're looking for?
I knew we'd find you here.
What... what are you doing?
I'm bringing Reggie to visit her sister.
Reggie, did you even go to school today?
The truth, Reggie.
Mom.
We did yoga.
Oh.
Good god.
Mother, what color is the sky on your planet?
It's a very bright blue.
Oh, I can't...
I can't do this right now.
Reggie, let's go.
I've never been here before.
I want to stay.
Reggie...
She's never been here before, Joy.
All right, fine.
Let's be here.
How do I become a reaper?
How do you...
Bandar, first of all, you have to experience the inconvenience of dying.
I can do that.
Don't you think this is a bit bloody morbid, though?
It's like, I can promise you, death will find you.
You don't have to invite it in.
You're never more alive until you're closest to death.
Very, very right.
Oh, my goodness.
Get off.
Oh...
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me meet me in the middle of the air if these wings should fail me lord, won't you meet me with another pair?
That's all you guys get right now.
Well, let's have a great night, guys.
Maybe this is our time.
Maybe this is our moment.
Let's enjoy.
Cheers.
- All right!
- All right!
It's always the same, whether it's asking someone out, jumping in the water, or losing your virginity.
They always say the same thing:
just do it.
My very important problem was,
I'd never done any of those very important things.
Hi.
I'm George.
Hi.
I'm Kyle.
I was just, you know, taking a moment...
Take as many as you can.
You excited about tonight?
- Mostly nervous.
- Me too.
I mean, I don't want to disappoint them.
I've never done a live concert on T.V. before.
There's going to be a lot of people watching tonight.
I don't know why, but for some reason, I've been picked to do this.
It's crazy.
It's way too much responsibility, you know?
- You're going to be great.
- Give me luck.
You know what, guys, it has been such a treat, but I've got things to do.
Okay, I'll see you around, all right?
Wait.
No.
What is that?
You have to give that back to me, all right?
I'm going to die tonight.
And you are going to take my soul.
- What's your name?
- I am Bandar.
Your real name, stupid asshole.
It's Fred.
It's Fred Swirsky.
I'm fucking with you guys, man.
I'm not a fucking grim reaper.
Jesus christ.
I don't know where this death wish comes in, but it's stupid.
I don't think you know how stupid it is.
You need to get a life, Fred.
You all need to get some color.
Maybe a little rouge around the cheeks.
Some sunshine, all right?
You, stay chalky.
You're gorgeous.
See you.
Thank you very much, you guys.
Thanks for coming out this evening.
Now, in my time of dying
I don't want nobody to mourn all I want my friends to do comin' for my dying arms well, well, well so I can die easy well, well, well so I can die young well, well, well
So I can die easy
Jesus gonna make up
Jesus gonna make up
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed--
No, don't.
Please.
Wow.
What's this girl's name?
What is her name?
Uh, Jeannie Bead.
Fuck!
Don't... don't touch me.
- What's this?
- It's for you.
Wow.
- Does everyone get this?
- No.
Did you get this?
No, no lights for me.
Not yet.
Every day, I watch people die.
Why one death means more than another,
I have no idea.
I think people need something familiar.
Reggie?
Mom?
Something they can remember.
Whatcha doing there, Reggie?
Grandma's helping George with her bardo.
Is that right?
The bardo is the way the tibetans help the dead sort out reality.
It's an ancient and respected ritual, Joy.
Well, I brought another ancient and respected ritual.
Chunky monkey.
Reggie, why don't you go scoop us up a few bowls?
You know, you're not the only one who's lost George.
The whole world has lost a soul.
She was my daughter.
Mine.
She was me, mom.
The same way that you're me.
And I miss you.
Both of you.
You see it out there?
George did good.
She did fine.
What's going on, Rox?
I had to shoot someone.
Someone died.
- Did your job.
- Mine and Mason's.
I meant your other job... officer.
I'm just stating a fact.
Did somebody important die?
Today, every day.
What kind of pie you got tonight?
It's pecan.
I saved you a piece, for my very important customer.
- George?
- Yeah, she did really well.
I can't go in there tonight and face the boss man.
Do me a favor and... tell him I'm piss drunk somewhere in the gutter.
Don't make more of it than it is.
I won't.
Come on inside.
I'm buying.
Maybe it's easier to mourn someone you never really knew.
I'm not sure I get it, all this shared pain...
I guess it's a place to leave a sign, a way of saying that you lost someone, too.
Everyone was connecting.
Everyone, of course, except me.
Okay, Rube, I blew it.
I completely blew it, and believe me,
I'm so painfully, painfully aware of my failures this evening, but, saying that, bring on more pain, because, no doubt, I deserve it, okay?
Pecan.
Not bad, either.
Think of it as a get-out-of-jail-free card.
- Nice shot, Roxy.
- Thanks.
Here she is.
Look at you!
Nice going.
Yeah, it was crazy in there.
I like your outfit.
Thank you, Daisy.
Roxy picked it out.
Ain't nothing but woman under this uniform.
What the fuck you laughing at?
Not every death gets a candlelight vigil.
Most deaths, they just got a sky full of stars.
That's not bad... for a nobody like me.
I know there are billions of stars in the sky, and they're all twinkling.
I wonder what makes one star more important than another?
I mean, why does one star become part of the big dipper, and another just flame out?
Wow.
See that shooting star?
My name's Vance.
You told me that already.
Right.
I'm just a little nervous tonight.
You should be.
Is that me?
Shit!
I only took one hit.
How stupid is that?
Well, they don't call it dope for nothing.
So... what happens next?
Do I go up there?
You're asking the wrong girl.
Some people believe there's something bigger out there... that there's something protecting us,
watching over us as we change.
I guess it's comforting to think that someone is looking in on us.
Reggie.
Reggie, let's go.
Come on, come on.
Hurry up.
- Where are we going?
- Just be quiet.
Just get in the car.
Morning!
Sorry.
We--we wake you up?
What are you doing on my house?
Don't mind her, Hank.
Last to rise, first to worry.
Mother!
What are you doing?
Joy, dear, did you honestly think that I was just going to write you a check for fixing this roof without looking at it myself first?
I always warned you this house is in lousy shape.
No, you actually used to say that about my marriage.
You see?
Right on both counts.
- Hi, Reggie!
- Hi, grandma.
Come on-
- Hank, would you mind putting the bags over there?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
Well...
That man has the most amazing hindquarters.
Reggie, you need to, uh, go get ready for school.
Oh, relax, Joy.
We're all women here.
I mean it, Reggie.
Clancy had such a flat ass.
You really can't trust a man with a flat ass.
Mom.
Nothing to hold on to.
You know who has the best ass?
Derek jeter.
Tch-ka, tch-ka, tch-ka.
You--you--this-- you can't be here.
The thing is, joy, I am here.
I should've been here before, but I was respecting your wishes.
So, at the end of the day, what has that accomplished?
You not being here.
Oh.
Oh...
Here's the estimate for the roof.
- Thanks, Hank.
- Don't mention it, Phyllis.
I have an estimate!
And I'm sure it's twice as much as what Hank is going to charge you.
Face it, Joy.
You never liked to get your hands dirty.
Whereas these hands... they love the dirt.
Some repairs, you can get an estimate for... and some repairs,
you can't put a price on.
People always say, "you can't take it with you."
But try dying and then coming back, see if you don't try to hold onto something... something important.
"Where I sit, thou hast no right to stand."
That doesn't make sense.
Why would I want to stand where you sit?
So Moses just told Death to get lost, and Death just went?
That's some freeze-dried bullshit, Daisy.
Yeah, I can't see Death giving up that easily.
I don't care if it's Ghandi.
If I have a post-it, I'm taking his bony brown butt out.
See, Death didn't actually take Moses.
God kissed him.
- God kissed moses?
- Mm-hmm, when it was his time,
God kissed him, and that's how he went.
It's beautiful.
Did you get to the part where God hates Death and promises he'll banish us from heaven?
May I?
There's no place for you in here, sweetness.
I don't know what this is.
I don't understand why I don't get this one.
Say what you want about my beliefs, but I'm professional.
I'm punctual and I get the job done.
That's it, Rube.
That's the last goddamn straw.
This is fucking bullshit, that's what it is.
She's just a kid, Rube.
She can't handle it.
Fuck that!
I can handle this.
What is it?
No offense, Georgie girl, but how long have you been in this business?
A fucking year at the most?
I mean, I've worked my fucking-- worked--
It's not a negotiation.
George has got the letter.
All these fireworks?
Let's just assume that's already happened and help our young friend with her situation.
Thank you.
What's my situation?
- V.I.P.R. - "Very important person reap."
I.D.G.I.
"I don't get it."
Open it already.
Did I win a prize?
Keep going.
K. Lowerdeck?
Kyle lowerdeck, the singer?
Come on!
This has got to be some unholy fucking mess-up, because this is my reap.
I was born to do this reap.
I was put on this Earth, and in this place, der the waffle haus, to fucking do this reap.
Please don't.
I was born to be a rock star.
If I could sing.
He's cute.
He's not as cute as my first V.I.P.R.-
- James dean.
Beautiful Porsche.
These really delicate lips.
But he was so confused.
- Did he try to nail you?
- No.
I don't know why.
I do.
You.
And you.
Fine.
Okay... why don't you just get a big lead pole, and stick it right up my ass?
Same location, different reap.
You got sloppy seconds.
I'm going to be calm.
Why does she get the cool reap?
Probably because you're a fuck-up.
Congratulations, Georgia.
You've arrived.
Excuse me.
I could've been James Dean, you know, if I could act... or drive.
- You up for this?
- Yeah, sure, why not?
She's going to fuck it up.
Hey, someone thinks I'm doing a good job.
Right?
Am I right or am I right?
Okay, rich girl, breakfast is on you.
Roxy!
Roxy.
Oh...
Listen, uh...
- George is going to need help.
- She'll be fine.
Well, uh... an event like that,
probably going to have police security, right?
You can stop right there.
I'm not losing my job over this.
In case you haven't noticed, I'm a police officer.
I swore an oath.
I don't care if you donated a kidney.
What you are is a reaper.
That's the job you're not going to lose, whether you want to or not.
What if I say no?
- Say no.
- No.
All right, Reggie gets out of school at 2:30, so if you're really going to do this, I need to have--
Oh, god.
You know, mom, you can't take care of Reggie and channel Hiawatha at the same time.
Reggie isn't ready for your... version of the healing process.
Reggie is old enough to make her own decisions.
No, mother, she's not.
All right?
She's 11.
"The path of care is the one we carve for ourselves."
You've been saying that for as long as I've worn a bra, and I still have no clue what it means.
Just, please, leave Reggie out of... your hocus pocus.
Rules are the first step toward tyranny of the soul.
You're right.
The rules are just getting in the way.
Ah, that's good.
Reggie, you know all that stuff about going to school and brushing your teeth, not talking to strangers?
Just forget about all that, okay?
You can just do whatever you want.
Do you need some money for drugs?
Why are you such a freak?
Ask your grandmother.
Where's she going?
I don't know.
Your mother was never very good about sharing.
You have to take me to school.
Oh, you're not going to school today.
What am I doing?
Can you keep a secret?
I had a secret...
I had a date with a rock star... and nobody knew.
Well, well so I can die easy jesus gonna make up jesus gonna make up sweet jesus gonna make up my dying bed
Holy smoke!
What the fuck?
Sorry!
Lord, in my time of dying don't want nobody to cry...
What are you doing?
It's Lowerdeck, from "lowerdeck"-- "in all his glory."
Oh, you're a fan?
Oh, I'm a fan.
I'm a big fan.
Oh, Misty, please don't.
- Do you have any?
- I, uh... no.
Millie, um, I was wondering if you could--
Excuse me.
Are you watching tonight?
It's going to be totally live.
I know.
I'm... going.
It's impossible.
It's like one of those unplugged sessions.
No one gets in.
Well, I guess I'm lucky.
You're going to be near him, and now I'm near you.
It's no big deal, really.
I-- oh!
- I'm not a lesbian.
- Millie, we've all experimented.
- You--I haven't.
- It's not as if I didn't go to college.
- We've all put our big toe in that water.
- I really haven't.
Delores?
You know, when you're young like you are, Millie, it's easy.
Man, woman, bottom, top... sex is this big buffet, and you're just a fat man with a fork, but as you get older, it's harder to get a fork.
Okay.
Thanks.
Um, I have to leave early today.
- Another doctor's appointment?
- No.
- A.A. Meeting?
- No.
- What, then?
- A rock concert.
- Enjoy the buffet, Millie.
- Yeah.
Okay, thanks.
Bye.
I'd like to get a ticket for the Kyle Lowerdeck concert.
Sold out.
I have $500?
Oh, well, in that case... sold out.
Asshole.
That sensation you're feeling... wouldn't be the sensation of utter failure, would it?
- What are you doing here?
- I've come to save your ass.
Let's go to the concert.
- You scored tickets?
- No.
Then I'm screwed!
Seriously, I'm royally fucked.
Roxy's downstairs.
Police escort.
C ool.
- Those are mom's.
- I know.
Do you ever look at these when she's not home?
It's all right to be curious, Reggie.
Death is the biggest mystery in life.
I'd be worried about you if you weren't curious.
Have you ever been to that place, Reggie?
That place where George died?
It's an important place in her life.
It should be an important place in yours, too.
I know.
We have to find the things and the places that keep George alive.
They're everywhere.
Her--her spirit... it's all around us.
Sometimes...
I hear things.
Me, too.
Me, too.
Are these all of your cool tops?
Some of them are dirty.
You want to see those?
I loved riding in the front seat of that police cruiser.
It was my first time without handcuffs.
It's a day of firsts.
This is cute.
- Is this blood?
- No.
Brain.
Last Tuesday, that guy who took the shotgun to the face.
Daisy swore she could get it out.
Promises, promises.
I also loved the fact you were in the back seat, George.
You looked just like a perp.
You are just so pissed off that I got a rock star and you didn't.
You just wish you were me, don't you?
She's a cocky little thing, isn't she?
I'm not cocky.
I'm just cooler than you are.
I got a rock'n'roll reap.
Up yours.
There's nothing to wear to it.
My only V.I.P. Reap was Charlton Heston.
- He isn't dead.
- Yeah, but isn't he really?
Did rube get a lot of big reaps?
I bet he has.
Rube is so fucking old, he reaped Jesus.
Come on, guys, I don't see what these clothes have got to do with getting tickets to the fucking rock concert.
George is a girl.
Looking good is her ticket.
You have a police badge and a bloody gun!
And George is young and cute.
Are these all your tops?
Hey, a dead girl has got to make do with very little.
I need something racy and clingy.
- You still got that $500?
- Most of it.
- Ooh, are we going to go scalping?
- Shopping.
- And you're on your own.
- What?
I don't like your fucking attitude.
You're on your own.
You're joking!
What?
No, but-- well, I'm just--
Do you twon think I really need you to get into a rock'n'roll establishment?
No, I don't.
I was born in a rock'n'roll establishment.
I actually was.
Behind the amps, backstage.
Roxy?
I'm so viciously fucked.
- Father Matthias?
- Confession is closed.
I know, I just...
Well, it's occupied anyway.
A boy and a girl are actually desecrating the confessional.
They are fruitful and multiplying...
Are you drunk, father?
I'm sorry.
I'm not being a very good priest.
No, you certainly aren't.
I know you.
Were you here for confession a couple of weeks ago?
I was.
Were you the one who stole a cross from a dead woman?
Well, if you want to put it that way, fine.
- It's very beautiful.
- Thank you.
So are you.
Father... tsk, tsk.
Well, I've done the drinking.
And the coveting, that's a given.
But that's where I stop.
What's your name?
Daisy adair.
My parish is poor.
I've spent a lifetime trying to bring hope to the hopeless, convincing them that there's some great reward ahead.
I worry about the hearts of men, Daisy.
So do I.
Would you like to know the secrets of the universe, Daisy?
We are born.
We die.
We rot.
It's all one big cosmic joke!
Oh, my lord...
I'm with the band, mate.
Cheers.
Uh, excuse me, hello.
I'm with the band.
Why don't you understand me?
I'm... with... the... band.
What do you think Kyle's going to say when he says,
"where's my bloody guitar?"
And I say, "the fat bloody security person held me up at the gate"?
All right.
I'm friends with the drummer.
What's the drummer's name?
I call him by his nickname, you know, Sticks.
Hit the road, Jack.
Roxy, thank god, man.
Fucking--you don't know what I've been through here.
I mean, in the good old days, you used to be able to just--
- Sir, step aside.
- What?
Sir, don't let me have to ask you again.
Step aside.
Don't pull this on me, Roxy.
Don't--no, don't get your little friend to come over and arrest me or anything, because you're not going to--roxy!
You have not heard the last of this!
Don't I know it.
She's with the band.
Look, she's pretending not to know me!
You're on your own, kid.
Don't fuck this up.
Roxy, you're a bugger.
You know that dream where you're sitting in class, and all of a sudden you realize you're naked?
Well, I never had that dream.
Until now.
Hey, Don, get someone to clear the fucking step, hey?
Are you all right?
Someone's going to die around here.
I think you're right.
Hey, I'm Jeannie, and I'm going to get you a drink.
I'm George, and I'm not going to argue.
So I haven't seen you around here before.
- I'm with the network.
- Oh.
Cool.
What do you do?
Okay, you're supposed to be here, but have no responsibilities.
I'm an... intern.
Nice.
- So have you met Kyle?
- Not yet.
Well, two years ago, Kyle's biggest gig was his step-dad's garage.
He was waiting tables at the daily grill, and this fucking agent finds him.
She's a vampire.
Really has fangs.
Anyway, just like that, no one can get near him.
No one can touch him.
I need to touch him.
Yeah, well, his new girlfriend will kill you first.
I'm going to touch him tonight.
Yeah, well, George, live hard, die young, leave a fucking beautiful corpse.
Amen to that, sister.
"Amen to that, sister?"
One more.
Just like that, I was a rocker chick.
Cheers.
Excuse me.
Yoo-hoo.
The thing is,
I've got this little package for Kyle, you know, it's a performance enhancer.
If you're lucky, you can get a bit on the side--
I've been clean 15 years, lowlife.
Fuck you.
You're going to be hearing from my bloody lawyer.
Do you know what I mean?
I mean, that's going to cost you, big time.
If you give me 50 bucks now, we'll forget about the whole thing.
How much to break both your legs?
Oh, come on!
This isn't rock'n'roll.
What do you smell like?
Uh...
Oh, come on, since when does a man need to shower to be rock and roll, eh?
You smell like death.
You are not exactly a bouquet of fucking roses either, love, all right?
Oh, fuck off.
- Have a good evening, sir.
- Huh?
Sweet!
Oh, mama, I'm home.
Come on.
Bandar wants to meet you.
- What's your name?
- Mason.
When Kyle used to play, it was like... a happening, you know?
None of this manufactured crap.
Wherever he played, people would just hear about it and come, you know what I'm saying?
Sure.
Well, it's not like that anymore.
It used to be all about rock.
Now it's all about the rock star.
Yeah, um, can you introduce me now?
Mm, I think there're a few other people who want to meet you first.
What's their deal?
I believe the deal is that you're hot.
- I am?
- Yeah.
You're actually Kyle's type.
You know, that effortless cool look.
Although, you could use a little lip gloss.
Do me.
Yeah, you wish, dude.
What the hell do they think?
- Let's go check out the buffet.
- Okay.
I died in 1938.
Which interrupted a very promising career on the silver screen.
So now I stay here, and I help other people go.
And they do go somewhere, I know that much.
I don't know if there's a heaven or a hell, but I believe there's more.
My whole life... my whole death, shows me that there's more.
I just don't know what it is.
Thank you.
You can't tell anyone.
I have to, I have to tell them.
Yeah.
I know you do.
Thank you for giving me back my faith.
So... is it true?
I don't know what the hell she's talking about, Band-aid, but I do want a bit more tequila.
Do you know what I mean?
It's Bandar, motherfucker.
Look into his eyes.
He's dead.
You're dead, right?
No, man, I'm deathly attracted to you.
I'm dead on arrival at your doorstep.
I'm dead serious.
Don't you get it?
You're with friends now.
Just answer the question.
Are you dead?
I was dead.
And now I'm not.
I'm a grim reaper.
I take people's souls before they die.
I knew it.
What is it like to take someone's soul?
All right, Bandar, you know when you're piss drunk, and you collapse on the floor, and someone comes to wake you up because the police are just about to arrive, yeah?
Well, I'm that someone.
And at first, they don't know where they are or who they are, and they're a little bit confused.
Well, that's why I'm there, 'cause I'm there to...
I'm there to reassure them.
I'm there to make them believe everything's all right.
To death.
Ah... nice.
To death.
Tonight.
Thank you.
Thank you!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Who's there?
Tommy Ryan, if that's you rmaking out with Cindy Stevens again in my confessional, there'll be hell to pay!
Cindy stevens?
You asshole!
Afternoon.
Uh, we were-- we were just--
Don't lie, Tommy.
Not on this day.
This is a holy day, for I have seen something wonderful.
Now, fall to your knees and ask for his forgiveness.
Jesus, father!
Do not use his name in vain!
For he is real!
Chill, father.
You're freaking me out.
Wait!
Listen to me, I have seen something wonderful!
Tommy!
No, wait!
Wait!
Tommy!
No, wait!
Wait!
Wait, I--
So... is that all there is?
No.
This is only the start.
Look.
- Father?
- Yes?
Is it all they say it is?
I'm as curious as you are, Daisy.
I know there's a much better place out there.
If I could only figure out how to access it.
The better place out there, in my mind?
It's the V.I.P. Room.
And tonight...
I'm finally getting in.
Ready to meet Kyle?
Ready for your brush with immortality?
Yeah, a brush sounds right about now.
- Hey, Jeannie.
- Hey, Kyle.
I saw your mom.
She says hi.
Oh.
Thanks.
Um, this is George.
She's with the network.
Actually, I'm an intern.
Uh, Jenny...
- It's Jeannie.
- Yeah.
Kyle doesn't do meet-and-greets this close to performance.
Please try to respect that.
Oh...kay.
She just totally rock-blocked us.
That wasn't cool.
Well, let's blow.
I'm going to stick around a while.
He's not really immortal, you know.
You can touch him, but nothing's going to brush off on you.
It's one thing to show up, take a soul, get on with your afterlife.
You can think of yourself like some kind of... accident.
But when you have to work at it, it feels more like... murder.
Offer you a lift home?
Why, Rube, is there a gentleman lurking underneath that cold demeanor?
Where's your cross?
He's a priest, for God's sake.
I wanted golden trumpets and angels singing.
I just expected it to be far more glamorous.
There's a place in Bombay.
It's called the tower of silence.
When somebody dies, they have no more use for this body, for this vessel, so they put the body at the top of the tower and let the vultures have at it.
Our endings, Daisy... they are what they are.
Great.
So?
Find what you're looking for?
I knew we'd find you here.
What... what are you doing?
I'm bringing Reggie to visit her sister.
Reggie, did you even go to school today?
The truth, Reggie.
Mom.
We did yoga.
Oh.
Good god.
Mother, what color is the sky on your planet?
It's a very bright blue.
Oh, I can't...
I can't do this right now.
Reggie, let's go.
I've never been here before.
I want to stay.
Reggie...
She's never been here before, Joy.
All right, fine.
Let's be here.
How do I become a reaper?
How do you...
Bandar, first of all, you have to experience the inconvenience of dying.
I can do that.
Don't you think this is a bit bloody morbid, though?
It's like, I can promise you, death will find you.
You don't have to invite it in.
You're never more alive until you're closest to death.
Very, very right.
Oh, my goodness.
Get off.
Oh...
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me meet me in the middle of the air if these wings should fail me lord, won't you meet me with another pair?
That's all you guys get right now.
Well, let's have a great night, guys.
Maybe this is our time.
Maybe this is our moment.
Let's enjoy.
Cheers.
- All right!
- All right!
It's always the same, whether it's asking someone out, jumping in the water, or losing your virginity.
They always say the same thing:
just do it.
My very important problem was,
I'd never done any of those very important things.
Hi.
I'm George.
Hi.
I'm Kyle.
I was just, you know, taking a moment...
Take as many as you can.
You excited about tonight?
- Mostly nervous.
- Me too.
I mean, I don't want to disappoint them.
I've never done a live concert on T.V. before.
There's going to be a lot of people watching tonight.
I don't know why, but for some reason, I've been picked to do this.
It's crazy.
It's way too much responsibility, you know?
- You're going to be great.
- Give me luck.
You know what, guys, it has been such a treat, but I've got things to do.
Okay, I'll see you around, all right?
Wait.
No.
What is that?
You have to give that back to me, all right?
I'm going to die tonight.
And you are going to take my soul.
- What's your name?
- I am Bandar.
Your real name, stupid asshole.
It's Fred.
It's Fred Swirsky.
I'm fucking with you guys, man.
I'm not a fucking grim reaper.
Jesus christ.
I don't know where this death wish comes in, but it's stupid.
I don't think you know how stupid it is.
You need to get a life, Fred.
You all need to get some color.
Maybe a little rouge around the cheeks.
Some sunshine, all right?
You, stay chalky.
You're gorgeous.
See you.
Thank you very much, you guys.
Thanks for coming out this evening.
Now, in my time of dying
I don't want nobody to mourn all I want my friends to do comin' for my dying arms well, well, well so I can die easy well, well, well so I can die young well, well, well
So I can die easy
Jesus gonna make up
Jesus gonna make up
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed--
No, don't.
Please.
Wow.
What's this girl's name?
What is her name?
Uh, Jeannie Bead.
Fuck!
Don't... don't touch me.
- What's this?
- It's for you.
Wow.
- Does everyone get this?
- No.
Did you get this?
No, no lights for me.
Not yet.
Every day, I watch people die.
Why one death means more than another,
I have no idea.
I think people need something familiar.
Reggie?
Mom?
Something they can remember.
Whatcha doing there, Reggie?
Grandma's helping George with her bardo.
Is that right?
The bardo is the way the tibetans help the dead sort out reality.
It's an ancient and respected ritual, Joy.
Well, I brought another ancient and respected ritual.
Chunky monkey.
Reggie, why don't you go scoop us up a few bowls?
You know, you're not the only one who's lost George.
The whole world has lost a soul.
She was my daughter.
Mine.
She was me, mom.
The same way that you're me.
And I miss you.
Both of you.
You see it out there?
George did good.
She did fine.
What's going on, Rox?
I had to shoot someone.
Someone died.
- Did your job.
- Mine and Mason's.
I meant your other job... officer.
I'm just stating a fact.
Did somebody important die?
Today, every day.
What kind of pie you got tonight?
It's pecan.
I saved you a piece, for my very important customer.
- George?
- Yeah, she did really well.
I can't go in there tonight and face the boss man.
Do me a favor and... tell him I'm piss drunk somewhere in the gutter.
Don't make more of it than it is.
I won't.
Come on inside.
I'm buying.
Maybe it's easier to mourn someone you never really knew.
I'm not sure I get it, all this shared pain...
I guess it's a place to leave a sign, a way of saying that you lost someone, too.
Everyone was connecting.
Everyone, of course, except me.
Okay, Rube, I blew it.
I completely blew it, and believe me,
I'm so painfully, painfully aware of my failures this evening, but, saying that, bring on more pain, because, no doubt, I deserve it, okay?
Pecan.
Not bad, either.
Think of it as a get-out-of-jail-free card.
- Nice shot, Roxy.
- Thanks.
Here she is.
Look at you!
Nice going.
Yeah, it was crazy in there.
I like your outfit.
Thank you, Daisy.
Roxy picked it out.
Ain't nothing but woman under this uniform.
What the fuck you laughing at?
Not every death gets a candlelight vigil.
Most deaths, they just got a sky full of stars.
That's not bad... for a nobody like me.
I know there are billions of stars in the sky, and they're all twinkling.
I wonder what makes one star more important than another?
I mean, why does one star become part of the big dipper, and another just flame out?
Wow.
See that shooting star?
My name's Vance.
You told me that already.
Right.
I'm just a little nervous tonight.
You should be.
Is that me?
Shit!
I only took one hit.
How stupid is that?
Well, they don't call it dope for nothing.
So... what happens next?
Do I go up there?
You're asking the wrong girl.
Some people believe there's something bigger out there... that there's something protecting us,
watching over us as we change.
I guess it's comforting to think that someone is looking in on us.
Reggie.
Reggie, let's go.
Come on, come on.
Hurry up.
- Where are we going?
- Just be quiet.
Just get in the car.
Morning!
Sorry.
We--we wake you up?
What are you doing on my house?
Don't mind her, Hank.
Last to rise, first to worry.
Mother!
What are you doing?
Joy, dear, did you honestly think that I was just going to write you a check for fixing this roof without looking at it myself first?
I always warned you this house is in lousy shape.
No, you actually used to say that about my marriage.
You see?
Right on both counts.
- Hi, Reggie!
- Hi, grandma.
Come on-
- Hank, would you mind putting the bags over there?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
Well...
That man has the most amazing hindquarters.
Reggie, you need to, uh, go get ready for school.
Oh, relax, Joy.
We're all women here.
I mean it, Reggie.
Clancy had such a flat ass.
You really can't trust a man with a flat ass.
Mom.
Nothing to hold on to.
You know who has the best ass?
Derek jeter.
Tch-ka, tch-ka, tch-ka.
You--you--this-- you can't be here.
The thing is, joy, I am here.
I should've been here before, but I was respecting your wishes.
So, at the end of the day, what has that accomplished?
You not being here.
Oh.
Oh...
Here's the estimate for the roof.
- Thanks, Hank.
- Don't mention it, Phyllis.
I have an estimate!
And I'm sure it's twice as much as what Hank is going to charge you.
Face it, Joy.
You never liked to get your hands dirty.
Whereas these hands... they love the dirt.
Some repairs, you can get an estimate for... and some repairs,
you can't put a price on.
People always say, "you can't take it with you."
But try dying and then coming back, see if you don't try to hold onto something... something important.
"Where I sit, thou hast no right to stand."
That doesn't make sense.
Why would I want to stand where you sit?
So Moses just told Death to get lost, and Death just went?
That's some freeze-dried bullshit, Daisy.
Yeah, I can't see Death giving up that easily.
I don't care if it's Ghandi.
If I have a post-it, I'm taking his bony brown butt out.
See, Death didn't actually take Moses.
God kissed him.
- God kissed moses?
- Mm-hmm, when it was his time,
God kissed him, and that's how he went.
It's beautiful.
Did you get to the part where God hates Death and promises he'll banish us from heaven?
May I?
There's no place for you in here, sweetness.
I don't know what this is.
I don't understand why I don't get this one.
Say what you want about my beliefs, but I'm professional.
I'm punctual and I get the job done.
That's it, Rube.
That's the last goddamn straw.
This is fucking bullshit, that's what it is.
She's just a kid, Rube.
She can't handle it.
Fuck that!
I can handle this.
What is it?
No offense, Georgie girl, but how long have you been in this business?
A fucking year at the most?
I mean, I've worked my fucking-- worked--
It's not a negotiation.
George has got the letter.
All these fireworks?
Let's just assume that's already happened and help our young friend with her situation.
Thank you.
What's my situation?
- V.I.P.R. - "Very important person reap."
I.D.G.I.
"I don't get it."
Open it already.
Did I win a prize?
Keep going.
K. Lowerdeck?
Kyle lowerdeck, the singer?
Come on!
This has got to be some unholy fucking mess-up, because this is my reap.
I was born to do this reap.
I was put on this Earth, and in this place, der the waffle haus, to fucking do this reap.
Please don't.
I was born to be a rock star.
If I could sing.
He's cute.
He's not as cute as my first V.I.P.R.-
- James dean.
Beautiful Porsche.
These really delicate lips.
But he was so confused.
- Did he try to nail you?
- No.
I don't know why.
I do.
You.
And you.
Fine.
Okay... why don't you just get a big lead pole, and stick it right up my ass?
Same location, different reap.
You got sloppy seconds.
I'm going to be calm.
Why does she get the cool reap?
Probably because you're a fuck-up.
Congratulations, Georgia.
You've arrived.
Excuse me.
I could've been James Dean, you know, if I could act... or drive.
- You up for this?
- Yeah, sure, why not?
She's going to fuck it up.
Hey, someone thinks I'm doing a good job.
Right?
Am I right or am I right?
Okay, rich girl, breakfast is on you.
Roxy!
Roxy.
Oh...
Listen, uh...
- George is going to need help.
- She'll be fine.
Well, uh... an event like that,
probably going to have police security, right?
You can stop right there.
I'm not losing my job over this.
In case you haven't noticed, I'm a police officer.
I swore an oath.
I don't care if you donated a kidney.
What you are is a reaper.
That's the job you're not going to lose, whether you want to or not.
What if I say no?
- Say no.
- No.
All right, Reggie gets out of school at 2:30, so if you're really going to do this, I need to have--
Oh, god.
You know, mom, you can't take care of Reggie and channel Hiawatha at the same time.
Reggie isn't ready for your... version of the healing process.
Reggie is old enough to make her own decisions.
No, mother, she's not.
All right?
She's 11.
"The path of care is the one we carve for ourselves."
You've been saying that for as long as I've worn a bra, and I still have no clue what it means.
Just, please, leave Reggie out of... your hocus pocus.
Rules are the first step toward tyranny of the soul.
You're right.
The rules are just getting in the way.
Ah, that's good.
Reggie, you know all that stuff about going to school and brushing your teeth, not talking to strangers?
Just forget about all that, okay?
You can just do whatever you want.
Do you need some money for drugs?
Why are you such a freak?
Ask your grandmother.
Where's she going?
I don't know.
Your mother was never very good about sharing.
You have to take me to school.
Oh, you're not going to school today.
What am I doing?
Can you keep a secret?
I had a secret...
I had a date with a rock star... and nobody knew.
Well, well so I can die easy jesus gonna make up jesus gonna make up sweet jesus gonna make up my dying bed
Holy smoke!
What the fuck?
Sorry!
Lord, in my time of dying don't want nobody to cry...
What are you doing?
It's Lowerdeck, from "lowerdeck"-- "in all his glory."
Oh, you're a fan?
Oh, I'm a fan.
I'm a big fan.
Oh, Misty, please don't.
- Do you have any?
- I, uh... no.
Millie, um, I was wondering if you could--
Excuse me.
Are you watching tonight?
It's going to be totally live.
I know.
I'm... going.
It's impossible.
It's like one of those unplugged sessions.
No one gets in.
Well, I guess I'm lucky.
You're going to be near him, and now I'm near you.
It's no big deal, really.
I-- oh!
- I'm not a lesbian.
- Millie, we've all experimented.
- You--I haven't.
- It's not as if I didn't go to college.
- We've all put our big toe in that water.
- I really haven't.
Delores?
You know, when you're young like you are, Millie, it's easy.
Man, woman, bottom, top... sex is this big buffet, and you're just a fat man with a fork, but as you get older, it's harder to get a fork.
Okay.
Thanks.
Um, I have to leave early today.
- Another doctor's appointment?
- No.
- A.A. Meeting?
- No.
- What, then?
- A rock concert.
- Enjoy the buffet, Millie.
- Yeah.
Okay, thanks.
Bye.
I'd like to get a ticket for the Kyle Lowerdeck concert.
Sold out.
I have $500?
Oh, well, in that case... sold out.
Asshole.
That sensation you're feeling... wouldn't be the sensation of utter failure, would it?
- What are you doing here?
- I've come to save your ass.
Let's go to the concert.
- You scored tickets?
- No.
Then I'm screwed!
Seriously, I'm royally fucked.
Roxy's downstairs.
Police escort.
Cool.
- Those are mom's.
- I know.
Do you ever look at these when she's not home?
It's all right to be curious, Reggie.
Death is the biggest mystery in life.
I'd be worried about you if you weren't curious.
Have you ever been to that place, Reggie?
That place where George died?
It's an important place in her life.
It should be an important place in yours, too.
I know.
We have to find the things and the places that keep George alive.
They're everywhere.
Her--her spirit... it's all around us.
Sometimes...
I hear things.
Me, too.
Me, too.
Are these all of your cool tops?
Some of them are dirty.
You want to see those?
I loved riding in the front seat of that police cruiser.
It was my first time without handcuffs.
It's a day of firsts.
This is cute.
- Is this blood?
- No.
Brain.
Last Tuesday, that guy who took the shotgun to the face.
Daisy swore she could get it out.
Promises, promises.
I also loved the fact you were in the back seat, George.
You looked just like a perp.
You are just so pissed off that I got a rock star and you didn't.
You just wish you were me, don't you?
She's a cocky little thing, isn't she?
I'm not cocky.
I'm just cooler than you are.
I got a rock'n'roll reap.
Up yours.
There's nothing to wear to it.
My only V.I.P. Reap was Charlton Heston.
- He isn't dead.
- Yeah, but isn't he really?
Did rube get a lot of big reaps?
I bet he has.
Rube is so fucking old, he reaped Jesus.
Come on, guys, I don't see what these clothes have got to do with getting tickets to the fucking rock concert.
George is a girl.
Looking good is her ticket.
You have a police badge and a bloody gun!
And George is young and cute.
Are these all your tops?
Hey, a dead girl has got to make do with very little.
I need something racy and clingy.
- You still got that $500?
- Most of it.
- Ooh, are we going to go scalping?
- Shopping.
- And you're on your own.
- What?
I don't like your fucking attitude.
You're on your own.
You're joking!
What?
No, but-- well, I'm just--
Do you twon think I really need you to get into a rock'n'roll establishment?
No, I don't.
I was born in a rock'n'roll establishment.
I actually was.
Behind the amps, backstage.
Roxy?
I'm so viciously fucked.
- Father Matthias?
- Confession is closed.
I know, I just...
Well, it's occupied anyway.
A boy and a girl are actually desecrating the confessional.
They are fruitful and multiplying...
Are you drunk, father?
I'm sorry.
I'm not being a very good priest.
No, you certainly aren't.
I know you.
Were you here for confession a couple of weeks ago?
I was.
Were you the one who stole a cross from a dead woman?
Well, if you want to put it that way, fine.
- It's very beautiful.
- Thank you.
So are you.
Father... tsk, tsk.
Well, I've done the drinking.
And the coveting, that's a given.
But that's where I stop.
What's your name?
Daisy adair.
My parish is poor.
I've spent a lifetime trying to bring hope to the hopeless, convincing them that there's some great reward ahead.
I worry about the hearts of men, Daisy.
So do I.
Would you like to know the secrets of the universe, Daisy?
We are born.
We die.
We rot.
It's all one big cosmic joke!
Oh, my lord...
I'm with the band, mate.
Cheers.
Uh, excuse me, hello.
I'm with the band.
Why don't you understand me?
I'm... with... the... band.
What do you think Kyle's going to say when he says,
"where's my bloody guitar?"
And I say, "the fat bloody security person held me up at the gate"?
All right.
I'm friends with the drummer.
What's the drummer's name?
I call him by his nickname, you know, Sticks.
Hit the road, Jack.
Roxy, thank god, man.
Fucking--you don't know what I've been through here.
I mean, in the good old days, you used to be able to just--
- Sir, step aside.
- What?
Sir, don't let me have to ask you again.
Step aside.
Don't pull this on me, Roxy.
Don't--no, don't get your little friend to come over and arrest me or anything, because you're not going to--roxy!
You have not heard the last of this!
Don't I know it.
She's with the band.
Look, she's pretending not to know me!
You're on your own, kid.
Don't fuck this up.
Roxy, you're a bugger.
You know that dream where you're sitting in class, and all of a sudden you realize you're naked?
Well, I never had that dream.
Until now.
Hey, Don, get someone to clear the fucking step, hey?
Are you all right?
Someone's going to die around here.
I think you're right.
Hey, I'm Jeannie, and I'm going to get you a drink.
I'm George, and I'm not going to argue.
So I haven't seen you around here before.
- I'm with the network.
- Oh.
Cool.
What do you do?
Okay, you're supposed to be here, but have no responsibilities.
I'm an... intern.
Nice.
- So have you met Kyle?
- Not yet.
Well, two years ago, Kyle's biggest gig was his step-dad's garage.
He was waiting tables at the daily grill, and this fucking agent finds him.
She's a vampire.
Really has fangs.
Anyway, just like that, no one can get near him.
No one can touch him.
I need to touch him.
Yeah, well, his new girlfriend will kill you first.
I'm going to touch him tonight.
Yeah, well, George, live hard, die young, leave a fucking beautiful corpse.
Amen to that, sister.
"Amen to that, sister?"
One more.
Just like that, I was a rocker chick.
Cheers.
Excuse me.
Yoo-hoo.
The thing is,
I've got this little package for Kyle, you know, it's a performance enhancer.
If you're lucky, you can get a bit on the side--
I've been clean 15 years, lowlife.
Fuck you.
You're going to be hearing from my bloody lawyer.
Do you know what I mean?
I mean, that's going to cost you, big time.
If you give me 50 bucks now, we'll forget about the whole thing.
How much to break both your legs?
Oh, come on!
This isn't rock'n'roll.
What do you smell like?
Uh...
Oh, come on, since when does a man need to shower to be rock and roll, eh?
You smell like death.
You are not exactly a bouquet of fucking roses either, love, all right?
Oh, fuck off.
- Have a good evening, sir.
- Huh?
Sweet!
Oh, mama, I'm home.
Come on.
Bandar wants to meet you.
- What's your name?
- Mason.
When Kyle used to play, it was like... a happening, you know?
None of this manufactured crap.
Wherever he played, people would just hear about it and come, you know what I'm saying?
Sure.
Well, it's not like that anymore.
It used to be all about rock.
Now it's all about the rock star.
Yeah, um, can you introduce me now?
Mm, I think there're a few other people who want to meet you first.
What's their deal?
I believe the deal is that you're hot.
- I am?
- Yeah.
You're actually Kyle's type.
You know, that effortless cool look.
Although, you could use a little lip gloss.
Do me.
Yeah, you wish, dude.
What the hell do they think?
- Let's go check out the buffet.
- Okay.
I died in 1938.
Which interrupted a very promising career on the silver screen.
So now I stay here, and I help other people go.
And they do go somewhere, I know that much.
I don't know if there's a heaven or a hell, but I believe there's more.
My whole life... my whole death, shows me that there's more.
I just don't know what it is.
Thank you.
You can't tell anyone.
I have to, I have to tell them.
Yeah.
I know you do.
Thank you for giving me back my faith.
So... is it true?
I don't know what the hell she's talking about, Band-aid, but I do want a bit more tequila.
Do you know what I mean?
It's Bandar, motherfucker.
Look into his eyes.
He's dead.
You're dead, right?
No, man, I'm deathly attracted to you.
I'm dead on arrival at your doorstep.
I'm dead serious.
Don't you get it?
You're with friends now.
Just answer the question.
Are you dead?
I was dead.
And now I'm not.
I'm a grim reaper.
I take people's souls before they die.
I knew it.
What is it like to take someone's soul?
All right, Bandar, you know when you're piss drunk, and you collapse on the floor, and someone comes to wake you up because the police are just about to arrive, yeah?
Well, I'm that someone.
And at first, they don't know where they are or who they are, and they're a little bit confused.
Well, that's why I'm there, 'cause I'm there to...
I'm there to reassure them.
I'm there to make them believe everything's all right.
To death.
Ah... nice.
To death.
Tonight.
Thank you.
Thank you!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Who's there?
Tommy Ryan, if that's you rmaking out with Cindy Stevens again in my confessional, there'll be hell to pay!
Cindy stevens?
You asshole!
Afternoon.
Uh, we were-- we were just--
Don't lie, Tommy.
Not on this day.
This is a holy day, for I have seen something wonderful.
Now, fall to your knees and ask for his forgiveness.
Jesus, father!
Do not use his name in vain!
For he is real!
Chill, father.
You're freaking me out.
Wait!
Listen to me, I have seen something wonderful!
Tommy!
No, wait!
Wait!
Tommy!
No, wait!
Wait!
Wait, I--
So... is that all there is?
No.
This is only the start.
Look.
- Father?
- Yes?
Is it all they say it is?
I'm as curious as you are, Daisy.
I know there's a much better place out there.
If I could only figure out how to access it.
The better place out there, in my mind?
It's the V.I.P. Room.
And tonight...
I'm finally getting in.
Ready to meet Kyle?
Ready for your brush with immortality?
Yeah, a brush sounds right about now.
- Hey, Jeannie.
- Hey, Kyle.
I saw your mom.
She says hi.
Oh.
Thanks.
Um, this is George.
She's with the network.
Actually, I'm an intern.
Uh, Jenny...
- It's Jeannie.
- Yeah.
Kyle doesn't do meet-and-greets this close to performance.
Please try to respect that.
Oh...kay.
She just totally rock-blocked us.
That wasn't cool.
Well, let's blow.
I'm going to stick around a while.
He's not really immortal, you know.
You can touch him, but nothing's going to brush off on you.
It's one thing to show up, take a soul, get on with your afterlife.
You can think of yourself like some kind of... accident.
But when you have to work at it, it feels more like... murder.
Offer you a lift home?
Why, Rube, is there a gentleman lurking underneath that cold demeanor?
Where's your cross?
He's a priest, for God's sake.
I wanted golden trumpets and angels singing.
I just expected it to be far more glamorous.
There's a place in Bombay.
It's called the tower of silence.
When somebody dies, they have no more use for this body, for this vessel, so they put the body at the top of the tower and let the vultures have at it.
Our endings, Daisy... they are what they are.
Great.
So?
Find what you're looking for?
I knew we'd find you here.
What... what are you doing?
I'm bringing Reggie to visit her sister.
Reggie, did you even go to school today?
The truth, Reggie.
Mom.
We did yoga.
Oh.
Good god.
Mother, what color is the sky on your planet?
It's a very bright blue.
