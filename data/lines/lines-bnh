- The quad, sir?
- The place is immaterial.
- What matters...
- Seven Masters I've served.
He was the worst, but I never meant him any harm, sir.
But you know the law as well as we do.
- Yes, sir.
- We have no alternative.
According to ancient precedent, a dying master's words uttered in the presence of two or more fellows
- constitutes...
- ..an unalterable decision.
Thank heavens we don't have to go to the Prime Minister.
The choice is singular, but there have been precedents.
- Sir Thomas Willings.
- Exactly.
Thomas Willings the pastry cook, in the 18th century.
I have assumed the office of Acting Master.
College Council is gathering.
I must tell them your decision.
I take it you accept to be Master of Porterhouse?
Splendid, Master!
Let me be the first to congratulate you.
Congratulations, Skullion.
I trust that this will mean a return to the good old ways.
Poor man.
He's most upset, virtually speechless.
The shock must have been enormous.
I can hardly get over it myself.
Well, we'll hear no more of reform and women now.
- Or contraceptive machines.
- Exactly.
A Master who really understands the old ways.
What luck, eh, Senior Tutor?
A real stroke of luck.
A Porterhouse...
Blue.

coming to you very much live and direct on Network 23.
Carter's the best known reporter we have on the air.
He satellites globally.
Where does all this stuff come from, Bryce?
The components of Carter's mind.
M-M-Max, M-M-Max.
[Bryce] People translated as data.
It's computer-generated, whatever it is.
It looks like Edison.
Max.
Max Headroom.
Max?
He's a computer-generated person based on you.
Two minds, but with one single memory.
[Man on TV] Sports.
Moscow Generators, 85.
Afghan Yankees, 117.
[TV chatter]
[Man #2 on TV] Protesters claim solar eclipses caused by the 34,000 network satellites already in orbit are causing...
Police riots broke out today...
[TV chatter continues]
And next up on-on-on Network 23, it's-it's Lifestyles of the Poor and Pitiful. [chuckles]
A weekly look at how the other half lives... rather weakly.
If you were any kind of man, you would know I am staring at you in haughty arrogance.
[Man] How dare you?
[Woman] You animal!
You cheap oil mogul.
I will never grace your bed again.
I'm Harriet Garth.
the Porky's Landing fans' candidate in today's tele-election primary.
Remember, your ratings are your votes, so stay with us for a great first act and the right ending.
I promise.
Remember, I'm a fan.
Elect me by staying tuned to Network 66, the home of Porky's Landing.
I tell you, I love him, Eric.
Love him, do you hear?
And you will never see him again.
- Never.
Never, do you hear?
- [typing]
Why?
Oh, why, Eric?
[Lauren] Network 66 is catching us up.
It doesn't make sense.
Porky's Landing is like visual halitosis compared to Max and Lifestyles.
So why are they accelerating like this?
They've never been this close.
This is obviously linked to this morning's tele-election.
If this ratings surge holds, they'll win the audience meter auto-count by 9:00.
I can't believe it will hold.
The male lead is sensationally bad.
The whole show is sensationally bad.
That's why so many people watch it.
But why all night?
Why now, just in time to grab ratings for the tele-election?
Call Cheviot.
We have a crisis.
I've been watching, Edwards.
- How are they doing it?
- We don't know.
But at this rate of increase, they have enough ratings to win the tele-election by the morning auto-count.
I wish Formby was still with us.
She used to handle things at night.
That's exactly why she's no longer with us, Mr. Cheviot.
What on earth is 66 up to?
It's 3:00 a.m., and our ratings are fast catching Network 23, Chairman.
The ViewDoze device is working splendidly.
Excellent.
They'll be rioting down at 23.
[laughter]
This'll kill Cheviot.
We must congratulate our new board member.
Your ViewDoze device seems to be a rating breakthrough, Mr. Grossberg.
Thank you, Chairman.
I'm rather proud of ViewDoze.
It's inspired.
Have you absolutely no idea how they're doing this, Edwards?
None at all, Ben.
Overnight ratings haven't taken this kind of beating since Snow White and the Baby Eaters.
My concern is the impact on the tele-election.
If they beat our ratings by the 9:00 auto-count, it'll swing it from our man, Peller.
The system will automatically elect 66's Harriet Garth by a ratings landslide.
My God, we've got to stop this.
Get hold of Peller, Edwards.
Get him in.
Then get on to Bryce.
Tell him to find out what's happening.
- I'm coming in.
- [beeps] [beeping] [phone ringing]
You better come in to 23, Peller.
Crisis.
Are you alone?
What-
- Yes, of course.
[stammering] What do you mean?
We don't want any nonsense around tele-election time, Peller.
- [beeping] - [sighs] Bryce.
I want you to use every machine in your department on this.
I want facts, figures, analysis, evaluation.
I want you to throw every techno trick in the book at them.
I must find out where they're getting these figures, and fast, fast, fast, fast.
You want this quickly, Mr. Edwards?
R-R-R--
[Man] Network 66 Research Department.
All our lines--
Oh, hi, Bryce.
Long time, no interface.
Uh, busy.
I need information.
Oh, I'm fine, thanks.
How are you?
What?
Uh, fine, thanks.
Uh, why are Network 66 ratings so high?
Are you guys using ratings enhancement?
Because the show apparently stinks.
Bryce, you're unique.
We're using the new ViewDoze system.
It enables people to view while they sleep.
- It's great for ratings.
- Hmm?
Is that a Dawcel Optics device?
No.
It's a cheap scam.
A straight con dreamed up by our new marketing exec.
But, uh, how does ViewDoze guarantee viewers?
It's supposed to be an exclusive 66 system.
It claims you can view while you sleep, so everybody leaves their TV on 66 all night because we're showing eight hours of Porky's Landing.
I call it a "drivel-in."
You coming to the college reunion think tank, Bryce?
Uh, no.
Last time we saw anyone, we were all ten.
Thanks for the hard data, Jenny.
[beeps]
It's called ViewDoze, and it's a scam to persuade Network 66 viewers to watch TV all night.
It's scientifically invalid.
How on earth--
Bryce, you're unique.
I know.
Now, look, Thatcher, our research people have cracked your ViewDoze outrage.
Falsifying ratings is criminal larceny.
Illegal, damn it, man.
Nonsense.
It's merely ethically dubious.
Perfectly normal practice.
My network does not lower itself to cheap practices to gain ratings for its political candidate.
[chuckling]
My congratulations, Mr. Grossberg.
You certainly seem to be able to upset Mr. Cheviot.
But, of course, you once worked for him, didn't you?
On the contrary, Mr. Thatcher.
He once worked for me.
[phone ringing]
Murray, it's Cheviot.
Yes-- [clears throat] Yes, sir?
This is an emergency.
Get into Control and get Edison Carter.
Yes, sir.
[beeping]
Edison, it's Murray.
Huh?
Why?
Because it's there.
Um, uh, get into Control.
- Aw, damn it, Murray.
Come on.
- Get a hold of Theora.
Don't argue.
Don't swear.
I'll meet you at the network.
[sighs]
Because it's there.
[chuckles]
[beeping] [phone ringing]
Hello?
Hello?
My God, Edison.
What time is it?
What do you want?
Edison?
Edison!
We're needed at the network immediately.
Sorry I intruded.
[Man on TV] This is Network 23 urging you to reelect Simon Peller.
in this morning's tele-election.
Stay tuned.
Stay Peller.
[chattering]
[beeping]
[beeps]
[Murray] Morning, team.
Uh, good morning, Murray.
How are you?
What are you so glum about?
I thought you thrived on action.
Good morning, Murray.
What's the drama?
Hi, Edison.
Uh, we go out of the wrong side of someone's bed, I think.
Aw, knock it off, Murray.
Get to the point.
What the hell is this all about?
All right, all right.
Big crisis.
Cheviot's coming in.
The ratings look bad.
They'll be worried about the election.
Aw-
- Aw, ratings.
Audi-Audi-Audiences, you're playing my t-t-tune.
Give me my own show, and I'll rule-- rule-- r-rule the airwaves.
My ratings would get a baboon-- 'boon-- would get a baboon elected.
Come to think of it, even Simon Peller.
Max, you couldn't elect just to disappear, could you?
Edison, leave him alone.
What's got into you?
That's-
- That's the old left brain-right brain con-con-conflict, and, of course, I'm the unemotional side, thank Bryce.
Children, please.
I wanna check any news-ups before Cheviot gets here.
Kurslar?
Murray at 23.
You freelancers got anything on the news line?
Dayside of the planet, I've signed exclusives on a couple genocides.
There's another plague of frogs in Egypt.
Here, nightside, there's just this morning's tele-election.
Dull as chastity.
All right.
If anything breaks, yell at me.
Everyone else is.
Network 66.
Let's see it.
[Woman on TV] ...Paris and everywhere.
Why, Eric?
Why will you not give me my freedom?
[Eric] I have given you enough oil wells.
Will you never be satisfied?
What would you know of giving satisfaction?
[scoffs]
Love can be a gushing oil well, Amanda.
A man knows that.
Take your oil wells.
Take your house in Malibu--
[Edison] I wouldn't miss this for anything.
This is my very favorite drivel.
[Cheviot] Uncalled for, Carter.
- [types]
- Look at the ratings.
Now, 66 is pushing Porky's Landing with a system called ViewDoze.
They're claiming you can watch it as you sleep, and that's a lie.
It's just a scheme to artificially push up ratings.
It's a bold tele-election hoax.
I want you, Carter, and your team to expose it.
I want 66 hit and hit hard before the tele-election at 9:00 this morning.
Keep me informed in the boardroom.
I'll show Thatcher.
Please do not concern yourself about ViewDoze, Mr. Chairman.
It is the tele-election and Harriet Garth that matters.
We need her.
She needs our ratings to help score her votes.
It's the natural order of the electro-democracy.
My ViewDoze scheme simply guarantees maximum ratings at the critical moment, and thus, automatic victory.
What troubles me, Mr. Grossberg, is that Cheviot can turn this his way.
What if he investigates ViewDoze, puts Edison Carter on the story?
Now, he can make anything look earth-shattering.
Of course Cheviot will put Carter on the ViewDoze story.
I've anticipated precisely that.
But they will never get as far as the ViewDoze story.
In fact, they'll forget all about it.
They'll be much too busy with far more graver matters.
[typing] [automated voice] Phoenix File.
Authorized.
Executive eyes only.
[Grossberg] The Phoenix File.
Cheviot, the head of Network 23.
[types]
Edison Carter, the world's top telejournalist.
[types]
Murray, his hotshot producer.
[types]
Theora Jones, his oh-so-clever controller.
[types]
And Max Headroom, the world's first and only computer-generated person.
They are all about to regret the day they conspired against Ned Grossberg, because I have a story that will not only make us top network, it will destroy each and every one of these people, and with them, Network 23.
[TV chatter]
[Woman on TV] But first, this special word from Network 66, your tele-election trendsetter and sponsor of Harriet Garth.
- [beeping] - [whoosh]
Ah, Harriet.
You look a little rattled this morning.
"Rattled"?
I'm furious.
Calm yourself.
Is everything ready?
If you mean, is there a freelancer creeping about outside my apartment and a total stranger standing around in it?
Yes.
If you mean, am I happy about it?
No.
Become happy about it, my dear.
You're about to earn politically useful notoriety followed by a surge of public sympathy.
That and ViewDoze ratings will have you elected by one minute past 9:00.
Or, if it goes wrong, political oblivion.
I don't like this, Grossberg.
It's dirty.
Naturally.
It's politics.
But it won't go wrong.
23 will take the bait like a ravenous fish.
Trust me.
"The bait"?
[beeps]
All right, Kurslar.
It's all set.
Are you in position?
Yeah, I'm hooked into her home security landline.
I'm burgling time-coded pictures off her burglar alarm.
Oh, by the way, I'm doubling my fee, Mr. G.
Naturally, Kurslar.
That's why I'm tripling it.
It is a pleasure working with a man like you.
Talent like yours is an investment.
[mutters]
Come on.
[chattering]
[Woman] Will you talk to Mr. Kurslar on the View-Phone?
Yeah.
Okay, Murray, I got something for you.
Uh, no, thanks, Kurslar.
I got the chairman in.
- We got a big story rolling.
- Not as big as this, pal.
I've got a very big story on Network 66.
- 66?
- Mmm.
I'm outside Harriet Garth's townhouse.
I'm surveillancing her place.
She's in there with some telejournalist guy.
He's been there all night.
You see what I mean?
- Are you sure?
- Sure I'm sure.
I've got pictures of her home security system.
Edison.
Uh, Kurslar, this is all a bit circumstantial.
Interesting circumstances, though.
All right.
Show me.
- Theora, pictures upcoming.
- Okay.
Come on, Kurslar.
That could be anybody.
- In Harriet Garth's townhouse?
- [Man] Murray, Mr. Cheviot.
[Cheviot] Right, Murray.
We got all that.
You're off the ViewDoze story.
This is dynamite.
This'll stop 66's tele-election scam.
Sex and politics.
It's perfect.
I smell ratings.
Get Carter down there.
Go for it.
Uh, Mr. Cheviot, I'm very unhappy about these pictures.
I mean, we need background, we need, infill, facts.
It's a public morals story, Murray.
I want a ratings peak by 9:00 to hit the tele-election count.
Get Carter down there now.
[beeps]
"Sex and politics"?
"I smell ratings"?
- What does he think I am?
- I don't know.
You better get down there.
See if there's anything to this.
Well, what do you want me to do, ignore a chairman?
[scoffs]
I'm not some cheap, doorstep, video paparazzi poking his camera into people's private lives.
That's not journalism, it's junk.
A private life is nobody else's business.
Well, you should practice what you preach.
You seem to think my private life is your business.
Get the chopper.
If Cheviot wants a scandal, he can have it and fast.
I want a clear-headed backup.
I want Angela.
What is the matter with him?
Well, Theora upset Edi-Edison when Edison saw The-Theora on the view-phone.
But it wasn't seeing Theora that rea-rea-really upset Edison.
He's got no damn business inside my private life.
Right.
Might be good for your career if he was.
No, I am good for my career.
I would quite fancy you, though.
I think she meant me.
- No.
She meant me.
- [clears throat]
- Sh-She meant me.
- She meant me.
- She meant me-- me!
- Me!
[Angela] Sounds like a hot story, Edison.
Thank you, Control.
We are airborne.
Harriet Garth, my word.
Yeah, our integrity and happy-endings candidate seems to have slipped.
[Angela] Well, we all slip from time to time.
Anyway, it'll give us a crack at the enemy.
"Enemy"?
It's the ratings game.
Cheviot's going for the breakfast vote.
To me, it's war.
[Theora] Chopper 23, are you en route?
[Angela] Yes, that's affirmative.
Almost there.
- You do need to hurry.
- How are you this busy day?
- Too busy to chat, Angela.
- [Angela scoffs]
She's a bit snappy.
What have you been up to?
- [Carter] Keep your eyes on the road. - [scoffs]
I might just lead you astray.
[Angela] Control, we are landing at Harriet Garth's building now.
[Theora] I have you on the set cam.
Kurslar's trailer is 17 feet to your left.
[beeping]
[Kurslar] The red dot's Harriet.
The white's her randy lover boy.
That's him going into her bedroom last night.
Now all you have to do is catch him slipping away, and your fish is landed, Carter.
[Carter] You ever been grunion hunting, Angela?
[Angela] They're leaving.
Give me the camera.
I'll talk to the randy boyfriend.
[Murray] We're ready to go live, Mr. Cheviot.
Patch it through direct, Murray.
Angela Barry for Edison Carter, Network 23.
I wanna ask you a few questions about Harriet Garth.
- Is she inside?
- I was interviewing her for the tele-elect show.
- All night?
- She's a very busy lady.
- [Angela] She certainly seems to be. - [chuckling]
Now, sir, I'd like you to explain this interview which you conducted at precisely 5:05 this morning.
Now, we see you semi-nude, and Ms. Garth apparently deciding to conduct your interview in her bedroom.
My God, is that Harriet?
Who is that man?
Who put 23 onto this?
This is catastrophic.
Grossberg.
[Angela] Can you tell us what positions Ms. Garth took--
Gentlemen, Network 23 has swallowed our fish whole.
I couldn't have wished for better results.
"Better"?
Hell's teeth.
You're exposing a politician who is identified with this channel on the morning of a tele-election in front of millions!
227 million.
Look at those ratings.
My, sex really sells, doesn't it?
You're worrying quite unnecessarily.
You see, she's innocent.
It never really happened.
[murmuring]
This young lady really relishes the kill, doesn't she?
What are we doing, Murray?
I have no idea.
Network 23 and Mr. Edison Carter, in their haste to discredit our friend, Harriet Garth, have relied on pictures which they have not verified.
The pictures do not show Harriet Garth, merely an unidentified woman.
Their allegations are entirely false.
Are you certain of this, Grossberg?
I mean, if this is provable, then--
Yes, Chairman?
Then we can run the counter-story, reverse the ratings, condemn 23 outright, and Harriet gets a huge sympathy vote.
[Grossberg] Brilliant, Mr. Chairman.
May I recommend you order that done immediately?
[Woman on TV] Later, we will talk to Harriet Garth herself, but first, here is Network 66's recording of that interview.
The time code clearly indicates that at the time the alleged scandal took place, we were conducting an innocent interview in connection with this morning's election.
It is this kind of cheap, sleazy, muckraking telejournalism and gross character assassination that I am pledged to stamp out.
I absolutely deny the scandalous assertions being made by Network 23.
I accuse them of deliberate falsification.
Murray, Carter, what the devil is going on here?
A false story mounted on flimsy evidence, my top reporter exposed as a shyster, a senior producer accused of criminal incompetence, and a major politician publicly accusing this network of character assassination.
Good grief!
Carter, I want you before the board in 30 minutes.
I wanna know how Harriet Garth was having an interview at exactly the same time as you claim she was having this-- this affair!
[beeps]
- Now, look--
- Don't say it, Murray.
- I shouldn't have let her do it.
- Save it, Edison.
It was my mistake.
I can take the heat.
No, it's my fault.
I should've realized the guy was acting.
Well done, Sir Galahad.
Nice of you to protect the feelings of your new overnight friend.
Well, of course you would've spotted it immediately since you're the damn expert at men slipping away at dawn.
You know, pardon me for being bright, but I'll never understand why people waste so much-- so much-- so much energy getting excited over the very thing they'll-- they'll-- they'll need energy for
once the excitement's over.
[chuckles]
Anyway, st-stay tuned for Net-Net-Network 23's very-- very-- ver-- very own version of Porky's Landing.
[together] Shut up.
[chattering]
- Excellent.
- Yeah.
[Grossberg] Our candidate appears to be pulling ahead in the polls.
Apparently the viewers deeply sympathize with her situation.
- I predict an easy victory for 66. - [clapping]
The only applause I need is the sound of the heartbeat of this great network.
I have only been able to help in some small way.
The man who's the real victor-- only one man can be identified as being responsible for this triumph,
- Chairman Thatcher.
- [applause]
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- Well done, sir.
[chattering]
- [Man] Congratulations.
- [Thatcher] Thank you.
Thank you.
It has to be a setup, Murray.
Someone wants to destroy us and Harriet Garth in one stroke.
The only question is, who?
[speeded-up voices, chanting] Zik-Zak.
Zik-Zak.
Zik-Zak.
[Woman on TV] Network 66 News.
The major story of the morning is the Network 23 scandal.
We have this from the chairman of Network 66.
I am personally shocked and horrified that a top network like 23 should act so irresponsibly.
I can personally assure you of the innocence of my very good friend, Harriet Garth.
You have my word as chairman of Network 66.
It was obviously timed to coincide with the tele-election primary.
This is nothing less than political character assassination.
The head of Network 23 should resign- [Man] Ridiculous.
- ...and my rival, Simon Peller, should step down immediately.
[Man on TV] Continuous two-way sampler polls--
[Man] "Step down"?
Damn, that's preposterous.
...in the last two minutes, away from Simon Peller.
How this affects the crucial tele-election ratings is not yet clear.
In an electro-democracy, we must ask the question, have networks like 23 become government?
If they misuse their power, if they pervert information from their own end, if they make ratings into religion, where is integrity?
Where is honesty?
Where is truth?
Where is the code of ethics?
[Man on TV] We interrupt this commentary for a sports update.
Ben, what the devil is going on?
It's clear to me that we have allowed ourselves to be misled.
[chuckling] "Misled"?
We're being massacred!
As head of this network, I hold you directly responsible for this--
Button your lip, Peller.
Carter.
The material we obtained appeared to be genuine, yet so did the interview conducted at the same time.
The question is, which one was the fake?
And who faked it and why?
And whether Harriet Garth was a willing participant.
If not, who set her up and why?
We have to establish the truth wherever it lies.
The truth lies, all right, Mr. Carter.
We all saw the pictures.
We all saw Harriet Garth.
With respect, we saw her back.
Oh, we saw a bit of her front.
Ashwell, Carter means her face.
And he's right.
Could've been a stand-in.
We have no choice but to pursue this, whatever the risk.
Get on this, Carter.
Get to Harriet Garth.
[chattering]
Here you go.
Anything?
Well, Edison's outside her house.
No one's challenged him so far.
Her View-Phone link's operating, so she must be talking to someone.
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.
Uh, look,
I know there's something wrong between you and Edison, and I don't, uh-
- I don't like my team to be unhappy.
You wanna talk about it?
Oh, it's nothing, really.
Well, when Edison called this morning, uh, I wasn't alone.
I see.
Well, that's none of his business, as you say.
That's exactly how I feel.
Good.
So you're sure you're not worried about it?
No.
Why?
You don't smoke.
Why do I have to embroil myself with Carter?
Peller's finished.
The job's done.
Well, yes and no.
I'm the politician, Thatcher.
Grossberg seems to think there's another round to play.
Harriet, use all your loquacious style for which you are justly famous, and soon you'll be swept into power.
Our ratings are massive.
What, after all, is one more lie?
[breathing deeply]
[doorbell ringing]
Why, Mr. Carter, what a surprise.
Have you come for the orgy?
Oh, no.
Don't tell me I'm the first one here.
Mind if I come in?
Of course.
Just smash the door down and invade my privacy.
Had I know you were coming, I'd have taken off my clothes.
Oh, if you think we should conduct the interview in the nude, I'm happy to oblige.
I know our ratings would benefit.
However, I've got something a lot less entertaining on my mind.
I suspect, Ms. Garth, that you and I have been deliberately misled.
Almost ready to go live, Control.
We're just getting undressed.
This is Edison Carter with Harriet Garth, live and direct.
First, will you explain what happened at 5 minutes past 5:00 this morning?
This global tele-election reaches every part of the planet.
My constituency is everywhere in the transmitted world.
I campaigned with the satellites, Mr. Carter, not the clock.
I was simply giving an interview.
- [TV off]
- She's lying.
What?
Harriet Garth is lying.
She's guilty of the indiscretions of which Carter and Network 23 accuse her.
I make it a habit to be thorough.
I've obtained and checked a copy of Kurslar's tape of her indiscretions.
You will note that the section used on air by 23 cut at this point.
Some technical matter.
The woman turns and reveals she is indeed [button clicks]
Harriet Garth.
I have evaluated this position and can recommend one single course of action to save this network's reputation.
But they may accidentally run that tape on themselves, or Carter may break her down.
If she confesses, we're ruined.
Indeed we are.
Our righteous outrage will backfire.
Network 23 will show our denial to be a desperate cover-up to protect our political interests.
[Woman] Yes.
The whole idea was yours, Grossberg.
You will take full responsibility, publicly.
I would be delighted were it not for the troublesome incompatibility with the heavily broadcast evidence to the contrary.
I can personally assure you of the innocence of my very good friend,
Harriet Garth.
You have my word as chairman of Network 66.
What does this mean?
It means Harriet Garth is lying.
[Man] And if Network 23 ever examined that tape or Carter discovered the truth from Garth, this network will lose all and any credibility as well as the tele-election.
Exactly,
Mr. Bartlett.
Exactly.
[Woman] This is grotesque.
You can't ask Chairman Thatcher to do this.
Are you suggesting I--
I'm not suggesting.
You consider.
[Bartlett] I move the vote.
Those for Thatcher remaining in office.
[beep]
Those against.
[beep] [beep]
Chubb?
Chubb?
[beep] [screen beeping]
[buzz]
Defeat is an orphan.
Victory has a hundred fathers.
Congratulations, Chairman Grossberg.
Thank you.
This is your chairman.
Moments ago, I accepted the resignation of Clive Thatcher.
It is my public duty to advise our viewers of the truth about Harriet Garth.
- [button clicks]
- Run the prepared news item.
Moments ago, Network 66 made this shock announcement.
Following the Harriet Garth scandal,
Chairman Clive Thatcher has resigned over accusations of conspiracy in the Harriet Garth affair.
- [Man on TV] We'll have the complete Thatcher story--
- I don't believe it.
- ...when Network 66 News continues.
- They sold her out.
They sold out their own man.
Murray what if both tapes were fake?
What are you talking about?
You can't fake a tape.
Pictures don't lie.
At least not until you assemble them creatively.
No, no, I mean, what if both tapes were genuine, but the setups and the time codes were staged?
I don't know.
Show me.
Okay.
Look.
- Right.
- [typing]
Edit lock.
[beeping]
Kurslar.
Kurslar hit the "edit lock."
Why?
Identifying her is what we wanted.
Yeah, but it's not what he wanted.
Murray, he was deliberately delaying the truth.
All right, all right.
All right.
- Thatcher supports Garth, right?
- Right.
But then someone reveals she was guilty, and goodbye to chairman of 66.
Brilliant.
It's sinister.
The media is running events, not reporting them.
Murray, they're manufacturing their own truth.
She was set up, and so were we.
Grossberg set me up.
Harriet, why don't you tell a nice, old, guileless telejournalist exactly what happened, fully, frankly, and dressed?
I am completely lost.
If she is guilty of this thingummy, uh, men and things-- why is Carter so sure she's innocent?
How could she be?
Politicians are always guilty of something.
Usually, the question is, of what or when?
Seems to me she's guilty of professional suicide.
Look at the ratings.
At least it vindicates our original report.
We should get Carter out of there.
He's done a fine job.
- The ratings are huge.
- And our reputation is intact.
Seven minutes, and the tele-election is ours.
As ever, Carter's been very clever.
- [intercom beeps] - [Woman] Mr. Cheviot, Edison Carter is on the line.
[beeping]
Carter.
So Grossberg is back.
He and 66 have double-double-crossed Harriet Garth, and I think her story will illuminate the whole nasty setup.
- I wanna go live on this.
- You realize this may increase
Garth's chances in the tele-election?
I believe this is a moral choice, Mr. Cheviot, not a political one.
We've got four minutes.
Well, then let's do what we have to do, Carter.
[Man] Cheviot, Grossberg's on the view-phone.
Good morning.
I'm back, Ben.
You won't expect us to congratulate you.
You're not welcome.
Welcome?
You and I built Network 23.
And you damn near destroyed it.
Drop the phony nostalgia and come to the point, man.
Don't trade insults with me.
I wouldn't trade cow flop with you, Ned.
You and I are at war.
And I'm going to win this first battle Cheviot, as 66 takes the tele-election.
So, Edison, you're going to go for me after all.
Yes, I am.
You really don't fool me, Harriet.
You knew exactly what was happening.
Save it, Carter.
A couple of hours is a long time in video politics.
This week ruined, next week revered.
One good show with the right ratings, I'll be back in days.
[phone ringing]
You're beautiful, Harriet.
Everything seems to be going perfect.
Grossberg, Edison Carter.
I seem to have been a little premature.
Yeah, the last time you were a little premature was when you were announcing my death, as I recall.
Yes, I remember.
A long time ago, Carter.
Well, jerk yourself back to the present, where I'm about to make certain that the truth about you is made very public.
Your tame politician here is not gonna get elected.
This is one tele-election the public's gonna win.
[Man] Come on.
Let's move.
Comment, Edison?
Will Angela Barry keep her job?
- Come on.
Talk to us.
- Did Harriet Garth cause this?
[Angela] We are running live, people.
[sighs]
I've just left Harriet Garth.
I now know the truth about this affair.
You, the viewing public, have the right to know that you, as well as Harriet Garth, have been manipulated for political ends.
With just minutes to go, this is the truth behind this morning's tele-election.
What do we do now?
We are going to win.
The public will not pay the slightest attention to Edison Carter's hysterical crusading.
They will switch to the next act of Porky's Landing, and the auto-count will elect you, despite everything.
You seem very certain.
Indeed, I am.
Soon the viewers will all be watching their favorite program again.
A full belly and a diverting show makes a bad revolutionary, Harriet.
Television is the opiate of the people.
Long may it be so.
Grossberg, what the hell do you do for a conscience?
Occasionally, I rent one.
Network 66 persuaded millions of you to leave your TVs tuned to their channel all night, ensuring the ratings that would give them victory at the tele-election.
The man who devised this scheme is Ned Grossberg, now chairman of Network 66.
He's the same man who brought you the Harriet Garth story, a story that is entirely false.
You, the public, have been callously duped by a man who regards truth as a market commodity.
- As for my own mistake-- - [Man] Check the election polls.
They're evening out.
[Woman] Peller's leading.
[Cheviot] It could go either way.
It's a horserace.
[Man] Again, they're both dropping.
[Woman] What's happening?
What's going on?
Network 85's trending up astronomically.
They can't win.
They can't possib-- [beeps]
[button clicks]
[Cheviot] The viewers have spoken, albeit a stutter.
[Woman] Mr. Grossberg's on the view-phone.
Cheviot, I will destroy you and your network, but not today.
So sweat a little, Ben.
You'll never know when it will come, but it will come, when I decide, when I am ready.
Vengeance, you see, is a dish best eaten cold.
[Lauren] Maniacal bastard.
[Cheviot] Well, it looks as if you're out of a job, Simon.
It seems the truth can be an expensive commodity.
But Carter did the right thing.
They abandoned both our networks by the millions.
They just voted with their channel switchers.
Maybe we don't fool them after all.
Is that your daughter or your mistress, Murray?
[chuckling]
[sighs]
Excuse me.
Uh, you know, Kurslar--
You screwed up the tele-election, Murray.
[Murray] Yeah, well, he cleaned up your mess, Kurslar.
That, uh-
- That frame-up of-- That was disgusting.
Yeah, but you fell for it, Murray, just like the viewers. [chuckling]
"Beware of jealousy.
"It is the green-- green-eyed monster
"which mo-mo-m-mocks the meat it feeds on.
"Who-
- Who-
- Who loves not his wronger who doubts y-y-yet doubts yet s-soundly loves." [squeals]
Shake-Shake-Shakespeare.
And Edison Carter.
That's great.
[mutters]
I'm sorry.
I had no right to act so... protectively.
It's my fault.
Well, it's refreshing to know that you're not perfect and invincible.
Let's not go too far.
- [clicks tongue]
- Ah.
"Bless-
- Bless-
- B-Blessed are the peacemakers."
What's happened to you people at 66?
No, I'll tell you what's happened to you.
Ned Grossberg has happened to you.
That is what has happened to you.
This is war now.
Do you understand that?
This is war.
Go eat your milk and cookies like a good boy, Murray.
I don't like milk and-- What are you doing?
- Hey!
You can't-- - [crash] [grunting]
Murray!
Murray!
- What are you doing?
- Hey!
What about me-- me?
You're outnumbered six-six-sixty-six to 23.
You need all the help you can get-- get-- g-get.
[chattering] [grunting]
Oh, my God.
[grunting] [bystanders gasping]
[Man] Look out.
Look out.
Come on, Ned.
Come on-- Come on-
- Come on.
- I'll give you a damn good fighting-- fighting-- fighting.
- Get out of my way.
[Max laughing]
- [grunts] - [bystanders gasping]
[Men panting]
Is that-- that it?
What-
- What about the bit where I du-duck, and the guy next to me gets hit?
I think you can look forward to plenty of that now that Grossberg's back.
Well, I should hope you're quite pleased with yourself, Carter.
Thanks to your fearless reporting of the Garth business, we both lost the tele-election.
You overdosed my public.
I just reported a political farce, Simon.
It's decided to watch a different soap opera.
You should leave it to me next time.
Leave it-
- Leave it-- Leave it to someone who understands show-- show business.

Where is your father hiding?
- I don't know!
- Why hit a young child?
- I was asking where his father was.
So, must you hit a young boy?
Aren't you ashamed?
Leave him!
He will tell us if we hit him a few times.
-Leave him. go out.
Don't fear me.
You are not in danger.
Nor your father. go and tell him.
No one will do anything to you.
- Did the cops hit you?
- It's alright.
I didn't tell them anything.
Why are the police seeking you out?
Calling you a terrorist.
Why?
They say they'll kill you at sight.
Is it wrong to be a union leader?

Who had hit you?
Oh rising moon, do not fade.

Stealing scums!
- You're a Tamilian?
Why run away from home?
Did you fail your exams?
Then did you fight with family?
- I have no one at home.
Did you make trouble?
Steal money?

Along the streets of a southern city, the one who came like a deer,
Who had hit you?
Can I ask you something?
You pray everyday and go to the mosque.
You donate to anyone who asks.
But at night, you smuggle in goods.
Isn't it wrong?
No.
Anything that can help people is not wrong.
Can't you go elsewhere to live?
Evacuate!
Evacuate!
If I hit you, you will die.
Did you get hit a lot?
- Did you get hurt?
Why are you in this state?
go!
He's sick but wants to go out to sea.
- You didn't tell him well!
He'll only listen to you.
- Where is he?
give that to me.
- I've given my word.
- Doesn't he have other men?
- Yes, tell him you're not well.
Not that.
Munnusamy's mother died and he has no money.
So, you want to go out to sea and die is it?
I promised him money for the funeral.
I won't go back on my word.
Your word will stand. go and sleep.
- What are you saying?
- I will get it.
- I'm telling him not to go and you want to start.
No, let this sin end with me.
No, this isn't a sin.
Nothing is wrong if it can help others.
Take Father and go.
- Don't worry, I'm here.
- Tie the tubes to the bags of salt.
- So many.
Oh, its salt.
- That is what I said.
- Are we trading salt?
!
Listen and tie it.
- This is what happens with newcomers.
- I was checking for ropes.
- The ropes are here.
What are you doing?
Who will answer for the goods?
Why throw them?
Do you know the price of each?
gone!
We're dead when we get back!
go and row the boat!
- I don't know!
The customs officers are here!
We will go in for having the goods!
Only if the goods are on board.
- You threw them over didn't you?
!
Don't overdo it!
- But how will we answer to Durai when asked for it?
You threw it with bags of salt!
How do we bring the goods up?
- What happens to the salt?
- It'll be wet!
- And?
- It will dissolve!
- Then the tubes will float up. - So will the goods!
You're a genius!
- The money; then the goods!
- Throw his 200 rupees at him!
Don't send 200!
Send 2000!
- What?
2000?
Father only took 200; what are you doing?
Do you know what Durai will do?
- Pay up and take the goods!
- If I don't?
- I'll throw the goods!
- Threatening me?
- No!
- Do you know its value?
- No you tell me!
- Stop it!
- Then the money?
- I'll give it!
Take what you had asked for!
Hussein's men?
2000?
Tell me!
- Yes Sir.
Aren't you ashamed?
get our inspector!
Hussein mustn't live!
How was it?
Why this much of money?
Wages.
Your true wages for the risks that you take.
I don't want so much.
- It's for those who come seeking your help.
- My wages are 200.
- Yes, I took that for myself and Selva.
Come quickly.
- Where?

The police came and took father away last night.
He has yet to return.
Why?
What harm did he do to anyone?
Why did kill him?
Tell me!
You promised to get me what I want.
I want him now!
I want him!
Are you happy now?
He was peacefully earning a little.
You interfered!
Look at him now!
You killed those reliant on him too!
Who brought him in?
- That Inspector!
Where is he now?
- No one knows.
- Look after Shakila.
-Everyone says they didn't see anything.
- You speak Tamil.
Ask them!
He was killed in broad daylight!
What do you mean by no one saw?
I asked; shouted and threatened.
But no one is forthcoming.
All these people didn't see anything?
We must make them talk!
Who killed the Inspector?
- I don't know!
I didn't see.
Until someone comes forth with information, this boy will get hit!
I know!
I saw it!
Do you know who killed him?
- Yes.
- Who?
If you're scared to say it out aloud, tell me in private.
It's not fear but pride!
Pride that we have a man to kill this animal!
Pride that our women and kids are safe!
Pride of our new confidante!
Why should we hand him?
For your medals?
We'd rather die!
Look we didn't see anything!
They're hitting children.
You can hide the truth but remember- the dead man is an officer.
We won't let the matter rest.
- I don't want.
- We ate..
- I don't want anything.
- Why this?
- It's enough you came.

It will be such from now.

Reddy wants out at the harbour for 6 months due to the cops.
The other says that is not possible.
Isn't that it?
Not only that. 30 lakhs of goods are in the boat.
Reddy can't get it.
Reddy says it is not possible.
I would like to try once.
You want to do something which we can't do?
- I will bring their goods out. - If you get caught, that's it!
But if I bring it out?
Tell him that if I can do what he can't, then the harbour is mine!
Tell them!
You killed them off!
We're out at sea after so long.
But empty handed!
We should have brought drinks!
- You could have if you wanted to!
I came alone.
- If you're that desparate,bring a girl!
- What?
- If you're that desparate, why not bring a girl too?

We should have whacked him up!
It's all too late now!
This will hurt our family honour!
This hurts not just our honour but our family itself!
Kill.
Velu, his wife and 2 kids.
None of them should be alive.

Baby has a high fever.
You must help.
Come tomorrow morning.
- The child might die!
- No admission.
The child is dying.
Tell him!
Ask him what his name is.
Ask him what his address is.
Ask him if he has kids and family.
For his kid to be well, our kid too has to be well.
Tell him.
go. go and treat the child.
What were you doing?
Why didn't you call the ambulance?
We did.
But they said no.
- Why?
- Because it is the slum side..
- So they won't come to the slum?
- No.
It has never come before.
- How old is the child?
- 1 1/2 years old.
Will the doctor give life if the child dies?
That's the worth of the poor!
Ask him what the cost of an ambulance is. - 40 to 50 thousand.
We will buy 5!
Leave it for us!
It will work only for the poor!
- 5 will be..
- Let it be!
We will buy it!
Do you understand?
Sit down.
- No, you ..
-Ask her how the child is.
- Don't worry.
The worst is over.
But the child must stay for 2 days..
We can cover the costs!
Your child is fine!
The doctor!
Thank him!
You saved a life!
We can't!
Don't mistake me!

Have they both slept here?
Look at Surya.
He sleeps like you too.
He's always talking about how he wants to be like you when he's older.
- We're making a mistake.
- Why?
Let my job end with me.
Why them?
They shouldn't want this!
They must study well!
Send them to Madras.
Let them stay with Shakila and study there.
That's when my influence won't be there.
Scared that your child will be away from you?
How would you survive away from them?
You love them so much.
I am not important.
They are.
Shall I tell you something?
If I die now, I will die happily!
I promise.
I will die very happily..
Save this poor woman.
My life is in danger!
Help!
Come!
Who is it?
- Ask him to come!
- Enough.
- Who is it?
- Tell him not to come.
He's in danger!
Come in!
Neela!
Come in!
Everyone's waiting.
If you come ..
When Neela's ashes are dissolved, no male Reddy should be alive.
Who are you?
Who?
Who are you?
Surya, look after her.
Keep the ticket carefully.
Everyone says mother died because of you.
Is it true?
Tell me!
Tell me!
Is it true?
Along the streets of the southern city, the one who came like a deer,
Who had hit you?
Oh rising moon do not fade!
Do not cry yourself away any more!
The heart cannot bear any more tears!
Along the streets of the southern city, the one who came like a deer,
Who had hit you?
- Sir, my first child.
You must name him.
girl?
- Son.
- Name him ganesh!
Don't fight.
I'll give you more later.
I did the prayer in Charumathi's name.
Send her the offerings.
She's no longer a child.
She's a brat.
He's always in trouble now.
- Enough.
Stop.
Hey why are you just watching?
- You're getting old.
- Enough stop.
The sea is here.
See.
- Why are you scared father?
- Don't be scared.
- Don't stop!
- Hold the wheels!
Hold it!
- Father are you alright?
Are you injured?
- Are you hurt?
Thank god my body was strong enough for this.
- Why so much for this small thing?
- Run!
He can't catch you!
- Is Naicker in?
-Wait he'll be here soon.
I knew him well once but lost touch.
I need to see him urgently now.
- What is the matter?
- Isn't he in?
I'll just need 5 minutes with him.
He's in the prayer.
Tell me.
- go on.
He's Naicker's son.
My only son has finally got a job after 4 years in Dubai.
Everything is ready for him to go overseas tomorrow.
- Calm down.
He hit a child while he was driving my car to the passport office.
- What happened to the child?
- It died on the spot.
Fearing the people, he left the car there and ran off.
But it wasn't his fault.
The child was playing and didn't see the car.
His future is ruined.
- What car was it?
- Ambassador.
- Whose?
- Mine. - go to the police complain that you lost your car.
Predate it.
- Leave that to me.
- Okay.
Do you have a driving licence?
- Yes.
-Where was this?
-Matunga - go to the station there and say you did it.
get money from Iyer.
I will take care of your house.
You will be out soon.
go on without worrying.
Your son will go overseas.
I'm Velu Naicker's son.
I will do as promised.
Look at this boy!
Just a kid!
You solved it the way father would!
Did you hear?
They seem better than us.
You didn't see it!
I saw it.
Surya, don't.
Don't come into this.
You want to become an inspector?
He wants to be one like his father.
He went for the police selections.
They refused to take him in because he was mentally retarted.
No.
Okay go on.
From now on, you're my personal Inspector.
Ask him to come from tomorrow.
Just come and go.
- SP is coming.
- Who?
Which SP?
- Raghavan.
-Why is he here?
- I don't know!
He's here!
- He's here.
Leave it.
Anything else?
- No.
We came for this only.
- I'm Raghavan.
- SP.
Yes, I know you.
From twenty years ago.
Come.
That's okay.
Come.
I have no search warrant or arrest warrant.
You don't need one.
Search out whatever you need.
I am not here as a police officer.
I'm here for your help.
Sit down.
Sit up there.
I prefer this.
I need to talk to you in private.
go.
go on.
My child's wedding's next week.
But it won't go on.
She's hospitalised.
- She's unconcious.
- What happened?
I had always taught her to be fearless being a policeman's daughter.
Last night, she went out to buy clothes.
She came back like a torn outfit.
Why are you here?
You should get them in and break their bones!
I found out who they are.
But I couldn't break their bones.
- Why?
It was the minister's son.
If it was anyone else, he'll be in pieces now.
I told the IG.
He asked for evidence.
None.
He asked if I was rich.
No.
He said leave it as they were rich and could manipulate everything.
But I can't leave it!
Everytime I see her, I can't leave it!
So I decided to leave everything and run to you here!
- I understand your grief. - Not just that ..
- I too have a daughter.
I'll take care of it.
You shouldn't be here long.
I'll take care of it.
I'm coming from the hospital.
He's alive but merely a vegetable.
- Are you happy?
- She saw me.
- Not just you but your animal sides!
- An innocent boy..
- No, he made a mistake and earned this.
- Who are you to decide?
- You don't get it.
The officer...
Just tell me one thing.
Who do you think you are?
god?
Then who are you to decide what is justiciable and punish?
Why did you do that today?
I had promised.
- To whom?
Another father like me.
- So you can promise to heartlessly kill.
He had made a grave mistake.
- Let it be.
Who are you to punish?
We have a legal system for this.
Why you?
You're educated and have lived well.
But we're not like that.
We suffered for food.
And before we could bring back money, we died.
Were we ever sure that we would live till night?
So we don't think of the courts and cops.
You need to hit back to survive.
We need to take up arms to live.
Would that make everything you do right?
I only do what I feel is right.
Then can I act as I wish to?
I feel that Selva was wrong to hit that boy.
I feel that it is right to hit him back!
Leave her!
It's our girl!
- I'll kill you!
- Where did you learn to hit others?
- From us!
Leave it.
- Why did you hit me?
Why?
Tell me.
- No, you hit Selva..
You felt it was wrong though I felt it was right!
What you feel is right is felt to be atrocious by the rest of the place!
- I was wrong to hit you.
- No, not hitting me.
Hitting the rest is wrong.
- What do you want me to do?
- Leave it.
Leave everything.
- I will die.
If I leave it.
- Then are you going to remain like this?
- Won't you ever stop?
I will stop.
But ask them to stop.
- Whom?
Everyone!
- Who?
The one who killed a union leader who asked for his rights.
Ask him to stop and I will!
The one who killed an innocent old man and labelled it as sucide!
Ask him to stop and I will!
The one who drove a bulldozer through a slum community!
Ask him to stop and I will!
The one who killed your mother at midnight!
Ask him to stop and I will.
Do we do this out of choice?
There is no other way.
From the bottom of your heart, isn't what you're doing wrong?
No.
Anything that can help others is not wrong.
Is it fair to kill one to help others?
- You don't understand.
I don't!
I don't wish to know!
Leave me!
Leave me!
- Ask him to go away!
go away!
Please!
- I'll take care.
It'll be fine.
- Come.
- I wish to see Naicker.
- Father is not well.
- I need to see him.
-Sit down.
Sit down.
The SP is here.
He wants to see you urgently.
Shall I bring him in?
- Aren't you well?
- Do you know anyone named Pandian?
- That Salem Pandian..
- He was working for me for some time.
- He was arrested.
He will be in court tomorrow to testify against you.
To think you were trying to help me and you got into this.
I, as a policeman, cannot stop this.
I don't know how you'll stop this.
I thought I should tell you this.
I'll take my leave.
My daughter is fine now.
Call Selva.
- He's not here.
You asked him to leave town for some time.
I'll take care of this.
Don't you trust me?
- How this should be done..
- I know.
He mustn't come.
Or talk.
None of our people will be involved.
Outsiders only.
We must have no association with this.
I'll take care of it.
-Surya here.
Pandian has..
- Not on the phone.
Tell me in person.
I called you so that you don't worry.
- Who asked you to come?
- He didn't say a word in court.
-I'll hang up.
Did you call me?
- You come.
- I told you to send someone for the money.
- Don't worry.
They couldn't get me there.
As if they could get me here.
Didn't you change the vehicle?
What is it?
At this time?
Hello Inspector.
No stones today?
What is the matter?
How come everyone is here so early now?
SP how come you are here so early?
Did something happen to someone?
I don't understand.
Has something happened?
Why so quiet?
!
I don't understand.
What has happened here?
Where is Surya?
What happened to him?
He got burnt badly.
Don't see it.
Along the streets of the southern city, the one who came like a deer,
Who had hit you?
Oh rising moon, do not fade.
Do not cry yourself away anymore.
The heart cannot bear any more tears.
Along the streets of the southern city, the one who came like a deer,
Who had hit you?
I'm going.
I'm leaving you and going.
I can't stay here any longer.
First you killed mother.
Now brother.
If I stay here, I will die.
I have no desire to be your child.
I will think of myself as an orphan.
I'm going back to Madras.
Don't stop me.
Or search for me.
I don't need to know whether you're alive or dead.
Leave me.
You have no wife.
Or son.
Now, forget the daughter too!
Just think you disowned me!
Leave me!
The prayer is in Charumathi's name.
Take the offerings.
- Shall I search for her?
- No.
Leave her.
I promised not to hinder.
- She might be suffering.
- She won't.
She's my child.
She'll survive.
See who it is.
If it is a new officer, tell them to let us end this first.
Tell them I said so.
- I'll take care.
- They say we don't have permission for this.
- Who must we ask?
We didn't get police permission.
- Have we ever asked for that?
I asked.
He said the mistakes of the last 30 years must end.
- Who said so?
- The new Assistant Commissioner.
These vehicles help the poor.
How can we seize them?
I know what else these are used for!
This involves Velu Naicker.
It might bring about a problem.
Who pays your salary?
The department or them?
Do it!
Who do you think we are?
Naicker will take your neck!
Yes!
We know you do that!
Who?
Who laid his hands on Selva?
!
They hit him in public and arrested him!
Aren't you ashamed to come tell me this?
What were you doing?
!
Has anyone ever touched him?
Would I ever let them do that?
!
- What does he want?
Why this arrest?
- We don't know.
Why didn't you ask?
- He hits all of our men everywhere!
- You're old.
Why didn't you ask?
- He might throw me in too.
Fear of the uniform!
Look!
These are their scars!
Feel these!
- Where is that policeman's house?
- Don't.
Why must you go there?
Who's inside?
Selva!
Who knows his house?
Who?
!
- Don't you know or are you scared?
- I know.
I didn't see any other way to dissolve the sin that I was born with.
I married an officer so that at least my child won't have the sins.
- Does he know who you..
- No.
He believes I am an orphan.
So do I.
- Your child?
Is it a son?
- Leave him.
Don't let him know you exist?
go.
Please.
- He's not here.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
I don't know!
Where is he?
- Not here.
- Where?
- I don't know!
Tell me.
Where is he hiding?
I don't know.
The police are coming!
Leave!
Leave!
The police are coming!
You still can't arrest him?
Everyone is on his side.
Today, a lady burnt herself to save him.
In front of me.
I don't understand why they respect him so much.
Maybe someone else is informing them ahead of time of your moves.
- I don't understand.
- Velu Naicker has 2 children.
Do you know?
They died in some petrol bunk accident.
The son died.
But the daughter lived.
He sent them to Madras.
Most people don't know that he has a daughter.
- The relevance?
Why did you come here?
We'll take care.
Please leave.
- What is this?
- I didn't say a word.
I don't know how I was brave.
Put him to bed.
-Are you well?
- I am fine.
I can die.
It's an honour to die for you.
- Look here.
- She's lost conciousness.
She doesn't talk at all.
She won't live past the night.
The doctor said that she won't live.
How can you be like this?
Enough!
Where is the phone?
- It's here.
- Call the AC.
- What are you going to do?
I am going to call him.
- It will make their sacrifices meaningless!
All that I've done will be meaningless.
I always felt it fine to do anything to make sure it helps others.
Now for one old man, so many people, kids.. it's not right!
Father is it you?
Is it you?
- I'm Velu here.
Is the AC in?
- Father, are you alright?
He was apparently looking for me.
Tomorrow, is my Neela's..
Tomorrow is your mother's anniversary.
Ask him to get me then.
- I won't.
- Listen to me.
- Do you know what they would do to you?
- I know.
Tell him.
- I can't!
Who?
Who was on the phone?
Who were you talking to?
My father.
- Say Velu Naicker.
Why?
What does he want?
Does he want to know when the next raid is?
Or where to hide?
!
He asked me to bring you.
He told me where he would be tomorrow.
He told you to come there and arrest him.
You need to testify against Velu Naicker.
- He named my son.
I won't.
You knew him for a long time.
You need to testify against him.
You must come and testify for us.
You don't need to be scared.We'll protect you.
Don't you know about him?
- Yes, that is why I won't testify.
Your husband?
Do you know who killed him?
Do you know?
Velu Naicker.
- I know.
- Yet you won't testify?
- No.
Why?
- He gave my son a life and made him a human being.
Please sit down.
Many have told me you don't refuse.
I need your help.
I am an ordinary man in jail.
You're an officer.
How can I help?
I thought you were a cheap man and I was desparate to put you in jail.
But when I see those who respect you as their life, I feel I am wrong.
There's one differance between me and you and what we do.
I do it wearing a uniform and you don't.
I see that and I need your help.
- You're educated and speak well.
I'm uneducated.
I will do what I can.
Tell me what it is.
The verdict is out tomorrow.
But the streets aren't calm.
If we go to stop, unnecessary lives are being lost.
You must help us to make sure court runs smoothly tomorrow.
- I..
- I believe you can do it if you wish to.
The verdict may be against you.
It may even be death.
I should have died at 10.
You won't have trouble tomorrow. go on.
I need another favour.
You must bless your grandson tomorrow.
Why are they keeping you in jail?
Did you do some wrong?
Are you a good person or a bad person?
Tell me.
Are you a good person or a bad person?
I don't know.
What is your name?
- Velu.
Shakthi Velu.
Do you know my name?
- No I don't.
I have your name too.
Shakthi Vel.
You don't worry.
Nothing will happen to you.
You go on.
Nothing will happen.We're here for you!
There wasn't enough evidence!
They can't do anything to him!
Along the streets of the southern city, the one who came like a deer,
Who had hit you?
Where is your father hiding?
- I don't know!
- Why hit a young child?
- I was asking where his father was.
So, must you hit a young boy?
Aren't you ashamed?
Leave him!
He will tell us if we hit him a few times.
-Leave him. go out.
Don't fear me.
You are not in danger.
Nor your father. go and tell him.
No one will do anything to you.
- Did the cops hit you?
- It's alright.
I didn't tell them anything.
Why are the police seeking you out?
Calling you a terrorist.
Why?
They say they'll kill you at sight.
Is it wrong to be a union leader?
Along the streets of a southern city, the one who came like a deer,
Who had hit you?
Oh rising moon, do not fade.
Do not cry yourself away any more.
The heart cannot bear any more tears.
Along the streets of a southern city, the one who came like a deer,
Who had hit you?
Stealing scums!
- You're a Tamilian?
Why run away from home?
Did you fail your exams?
Then did you fight with family?
- I have no one at home.
Did you make trouble?
Steal money?
Then?
I killed someone
Along the streets of a southern city, the one who came like a deer,
Who had hit you?
Oh rising moon, do not fade.
Do not cry yourself away any more.
The heart cannot bear any more tears.
Along the streets of a southern city, the one who came like a deer,
Who had hit you?
Can I ask you something?
You pray everyday and go to the mosque.
You donate to anyone who asks.
But at night, you smuggle in goods.
Isn't it wrong?
No.
Anything that can help people is not wrong.
Can't you go elsewhere to live?
Evacuate!
Evacuate!
If I hit you, you will die.
Did you get hit a lot?
- Did you get hurt?
Why are you in this state?
go!
He's sick but wants to go out to sea.
- You didn't tell him well!
He'll only listen to you.
- Where is he?
give that to me.
- I've given my word.
- Doesn't he have other men?
- Yes, tell him you're not well.
Not that.
Munnusamy's mother died and he has no money.
So, you want to go out to sea and die is it?
I promised him money for the funeral.
I won't go back on my word.
Your word will stand. go and sleep.
- What are you saying?
- I will get it.
- I'm telling him not to go and you want to start.
No, let this sin end with me.
No, this isn't a sin.
Nothing is wrong if it can help others.
Take Father and go.
- Don't worry, I'm here.
- Tie the tubes to the bags of salt.
- So many.
Oh, its salt.
- That is what I said.
- Are we trading salt?
!
Listen and tie it.
- This is what happens with newcomers.
- I was checking for ropes.
- The ropes are here.
What are you doing?
Who will answer for the goods?
Why throw them?
Do you know the price of each?
gone!
We're dead when we get back!
go and row the boat!
- I don't know!
The customs officers are here!
We will go in for having the goods!
Only if the goods are on board.
- You threw them over didn't you?
!
Don't overdo it!
- But how will we answer to Durai when asked for it?
You threw it with bags of salt!
How do we bring the goods up?
- What happens to the salt?
- It'll be wet!
- And?
- It will dissolve!
- Then the tubes will float up. - So will the goods!
You're a genius!
- The money; then the goods!
- Throw his 200 rupees at him!
Don't send 200!
Send 2000!
- What?
2000?
Father only took 200; what are you doing?
Do you know what Durai will do?
- Pay up and take the goods!
- If I don't?
- I'll throw the goods!
- Threatening me?
- No!
- Do you know its value?
- No you tell me!
- Stop it!
- Then the money?
- I'll give it!
Take what you had asked for!
Hussein's men?
2000?
Tell me!
- Yes Sir.
Aren't you ashamed?
get our inspector!
Hussein mustn't live!
How was it?
Why this much of money?
Wages.
Your true wages for the risks that you take.
I don't want so much.
- It's for those who come seeking your help.
- My wages are 200.
- Yes, I took that for myself and Selva.
Come quickly.
- Where?
- To a place of good fun!
My laughter is the festival of lights.
Every night here is sleepless.
I am a flower that blossom with you.
The nector of celestial beings.
My laughter is the festival of lights.
Every night here is sleepless.
There isn't much to this world.
There is no day or night here.

There is no day or night here.
Everything that comes has to go.
Even the moon fades away.
As my body is yearning away, I see you here!
The time is right.
Come!
My laughter is the festival of lights.
Every night here is sleepless.
I am a flower that blossoms with you.
The nector of celestial beings.
My laughter is the festival of lights.
Every night here is sleepless.
When did the waves go to sleep?
When did they cross the shores?
When did the waves go to sleep?
When did they cross the shores?
Instruments care not who strum them - sweet music always abounds!
I too am an instrument in the hand that strums!
At the time when the diamonds are shining in the sky!
The time is right!
Come!

Every night here is sleepless.
I am a flower that blossoms with you.
The nector of celestial beings.

Are you a Tamilian?
Can I ask you something?
Could you let me go off early?
At about one is enough.
Why do you need to go out and earn somemore?
No, I have a maths exam tomorrow.
If you let me go, I can practice.
Are you studying?
In a school?
- What school?
- Nawaraji.
- Which grade?
- 10th.
Its the midterms tomorrow.
If you go they'll send someone else in.
Just let me off at 1 .
I will sit here and study.
Books?
go on.
Study.
The police came and took father away last night.
He has yet to return.
Why?
What harm did he do to anyone?
Why did kill him?
Tell me!
You promised to get me what I want.
I want him now!
I want him!
Are you happy now?
He was peacefully earning a little.
You interfered!
Look at him now!
You killed those reliant on him too!
Who brought him in?
- That Inspector!
Where is he now?
- No one knows.
- Look after Shakila.
-Everyone says they didn't see anything.
- You speak Tamil.
Ask them!
He was killed in broad daylight!
What do you mean by no one saw?
I asked; shouted and threatened.
But no one is forthcoming.
All these people didn't see anything?
We must make them talk!
Who killed the Inspector?
- I don't know!
I didn't see.
Until someone comes forth with information, this boy will get hit!
I know!
I saw it!
Do you know who killed him?
- Yes.
- Who?
If you're scared to say it out aloud, tell me in private.
It's not fear but pride!
Pride that we have a man to kill this animal!
Pride that our women and kids are safe!
Pride of our new confidante!
Why should we hand him?
For your medals?
We'd rather die!
Look we didn't see anything!
They're hitting children.
You can hide the truth but remember- the dead man is an officer.
We won't let the matter rest.
- I don't want.
- We ate..
- I don't want anything.
- Why this?
- It's enough you came.
- Leave it.
It will be such from now.
Come.
He has been mentally retarded since birth.
Ask if she is the Inspector's wife.
I am indebted to the officer.
I came to pay back the debt.

It's alright.
Looks like big trouble.
They're clashing.
Do you understand it?
Reddy wants out at the harbour for 6 months due to the cops.
The other says that is not possible.
Isn't that it?
Not only that. 30 lakhs of goods are in the boat.
Reddy can't get it.
Reddy says it is not possible.
I would like to try once.
You want to do something which we can't do?
- I will bring their goods out. - If you get caught, that's it!
But if I bring it out?
Tell him that if I can do what he can't, then the harbour is mine!
Tell them!
You killed them off!
We're out at sea after so long.
But empty handed!
We should have brought drinks!
- You could have if you wanted to!
I came alone.
- If you're that desparate,bring a girl!
- What?
- If you're that desparate, why not bring a girl too?

I have seen exciting dances on screen!
I've been part of the dancing crowds on the floor!

I don't want money.
This is my present to the Reddiars.
- We mustn't let him off.
- He got away though we told customs.
We should have whacked him up!
It's all too late now!
This will hurt our family honour!
This hurts not just our honour but our family itself!
Kill.
Velu, his wife and 2 kids.
None of them should be alive.
Looks like my child might die!
Save my child!

Come tomorrow morning.
- The child might die!
- No admission.
The child is dying.
Tell him!
Ask him what his name is.

Ask him if he has kids and family.
For his kid to be well, our kid too has to be well.
Tell him.
go. go and treat the child.
What were you doing?
Why didn't you call the ambulance?
We did.
But they said no.
- Why?
- Because it is the slum side..
- So they won't come to the slum?
- No.
It has never come before.
- How old is the child?
- 1 1/2 years old.
Will the doctor give life if the child dies?
That's the worth of the poor!
Ask him what the cost of an ambulance is. - 40 to 50 thousand.
We will buy 5!
Leave it for us!
It will work only for the poor!
- 5 will be..
- Let it be!
We will buy it!
Do you understand?
Sit down.
- No, you ..
-Ask her how the child is.
- Don't worry.
The worst is over.
But the child must stay for 2 days..
We can cover the costs!
Your child is fine!
The doctor!
Thank him!
You saved a life!
We can't!
Don't mistake me!

Have they both slept here?
Look at Surya.
He sleeps like you too.
He's always talking about how he wants to be like you when he's older.
- We're making a mistake.
- Why?
Let my job end with me.
Why them?
They shouldn't want this!
They must study well!
Send them to Madras.
Let them stay with Shakila and study there.
That's when my influence won't be there.
Scared that your child will be away from you?
How would you survive away from them?
You love them so much.
I am not important.
They are.
Shall I tell you something?
If I die now, I will die happily!
I promise.
I will die very happily..
Save this poor woman.
My life is in danger!
Help!
Come!
Who is it?
- Ask him to come!
- Enough.
- Who is it?
- Tell him not to come.
He's in danger!
Come in!
Neela!
Come in!
Everyone's waiting.
If you come ..
When Neela's ashes are dissolved, no male Reddy should be alive.
Who are you?
Who?
Who are you?
Surya, look after her.
Keep the ticket carefully.
Everyone says mother died because of you.
Is it true?
Tell me!
Tell me!
Is it true?
Along the streets of the southern city, the one who came like a deer,
Who had hit you?
Oh rising moon do not fade!
Do not cry yourself away any more!
The heart cannot bear any more tears!
Along the streets of the southern city, the one who came like a deer,
Who had hit you?
- Sir, my first child.
You must name him.
girl?
- Son.
- Name him ganesh!
Don't fight.
I'll give you more later.
I did the prayer in Charumathi's name.
Send her the offerings.
She's no longer a child.
She's a brat.
He's always in trouble now.
- Enough.
Stop.
Hey why are you just watching?
- You're getting old.
- Enough stop.
The sea is here.
See.
- Why are you scared father?
- Don't be scared.
- Don't stop!
- Hold the wheels!
Hold it!
- Father are you alright?
Are you injured?
- Are you hurt?
Thank god my body was strong enough for this.
- Why so much for this small thing?
- Run!
He can't catch you!
- Is Naicker in?
-Wait he'll be here soon.
I knew him well once but lost touch.
I need to see him urgently now.
- What is the matter?
- Isn't he in?
I'll just need 5 minutes with him.
He's in the prayer.
Tell me.
- go on.
He's Naicker's son.
My only son has finally got a job after 4 years in Dubai.
Everything is ready for him to go overseas tomorrow.
- Calm down.
He hit a child while he was driving my car to the passport office.
- What happened to the child?
- It died on the spot.
Fearing the people, he left the car there and ran off.
But it wasn't his fault.
The child was playing and didn't see the car.
His future is ruined.
- What car was it?
- Ambassador.
- Whose?
- Mine. - go to the police complain that you lost your car.
Predate it.
- Leave that to me.
- Okay.
Do you have a driving licence?
- Yes.
-Where was this?
-Matunga - go to the station there and say you did it.
get money from Iyer.
I will take care of your house.
You will be out soon.
go on without worrying.
Your son will go overseas.
I'm Velu Naicker's son.
I will do as promised.
Look at this boy!
Just a kid!
You solved it the way father would!
Did you hear?
They seem better than us.
You didn't see it!
I saw it.
Surya, don't.
Don't come into this.
You want to become an inspector?
He wants to be one like his father.
He went for the police selections.
They refused to take him in because he was mentally retarted.
No.
Okay go on.
From now on, you're my personal Inspector.
Ask him to come from tomorrow.
Just come and go.
- SP is coming.
- Who?
Which SP?
- Raghavan.
-Why is he here?
- I don't know!
He's here!
- He's here.
Leave it.
Anything else?
- No.
We came for this only.
- I'm Raghavan.
- SP.
Yes, I know you.
From twenty years ago.
Come.
That's okay.
Come.
I have no search warrant or arrest warrant.
You don't need one.
Search out whatever you need.
I am not here as a police officer.
I'm here for your help.
Sit down.
Sit up there.
I prefer this.
I need to talk to you in private.
go.
go on.
My child's wedding's next week.
But it won't go on.
She's hospitalised.
- She's unconcious.
- What happened?
I had always taught her to be fearless being a policeman's daughter.
Last night, she went out to buy clothes.
She came back like a torn outfit.
Why are you here?
You should get them in and break their bones!
I found out who they are.
But I couldn't break their bones.
- Why?
It was the minister's son.
If it was anyone else, he'll be in pieces now.
I told the IG.
He asked for evidence.
None.
He asked if I was rich.
No.
He said leave it as they were rich and could manipulate everything.
But I can't leave it!
Everytime I see her, I can't leave it!
So I decided to leave everything and run to you here!
- I understand your grief. - Not just that ..
- I too have a daughter.
I'll take care of it.
You shouldn't be here long.
I'll take care of it.
I'm coming from the hospital.
He's alive but merely a vegetable.
- Are you happy?
- She saw me.
- Not just you but your animal sides!
- An innocent boy..
- No, he made a mistake and earned this.
- Who are you to decide?
- You don't get it.
The officer...
Just tell me one thing.
Who do you think you are?
god?
Then who are you to decide what is justiciable and punish?
Why did you do that today?
I had promised.
- To whom?
Another father like me.
- So you can promise to heartlessly kill.
He had made a grave mistake.
- Let it be.
Who are you to punish?
We have a legal system for this.
Why you?
You're educated and have lived well.
But we're not like that.
We suffered for food.
And before we could bring back money, we died.
Were we ever sure that we would live till night?
So we don't think of the courts and cops.
You need to hit back to survive.
We need to take up arms to live.
Would that make everything you do right?
I only do what I feel is right.
Then can I act as I wish to?
I feel that Selva was wrong to hit that boy.
I feel that it is right to hit him back!
Leave her!
It's our girl!
- I'll kill you!
- Where did you learn to hit others?
- From us!
Leave it.
- Why did you hit me?
Why?
Tell me.
- No, you hit Selva..
You felt it was wrong though I felt it was right!
What you feel is right is felt to be atrocious by the rest of the place!
- I was wrong to hit you.
- No, not hitting me.
Hitting the rest is wrong.
- What do you want me to do?
- Leave it.
Leave everything.
- I will die.
If I leave it.
- Then are you going to remain like this?
- Won't you ever stop?
I will stop.
But ask them to stop.
- Whom?
Everyone!
- Who?
The one who killed a union leader who asked for his rights.
Ask him to stop and I will!
The one who killed an innocent old man and labelled it as sucide!
Ask him to stop and I will!
The one who drove a bulldozer through a slum community!
Ask him to stop and I will!
The one who killed your mother at midnight!
Ask him to stop and I will.
Do we do this out of choice?
There is no other way.
From the bottom of your heart, isn't what you're doing wrong?
No.
Anything that can help others is not wrong.
Is it fair to kill one to help others?
- You don't understand.
I don't!
I don't wish to know!
Leave me!
Leave me!
- Ask him to go away!
go away!
Please!
- I'll take care.
It'll be fine.
- Come.
- I wish to see Naicker.
- Father is not well.
- I need to see him.
-Sit down.
Sit down.
The SP is here.
He wants to see you urgently.
Shall I bring him in?
- Aren't you well?
- Do you know anyone named Pandian?
- That Salem Pandian..
- He was working for me for some time.
- He was arrested.
He will be in court tomorrow to testify against you.
To think you were trying to help me and you got into this.
I, as a policeman, cannot stop this.
I don't know how you'll stop this.
I thought I should tell you this.
I'll take my leave.
My daughter is fine now.
Call Selva.
- He's not here.
You asked him to leave town for some time.
I'll take care of this.
Don't you trust me?
- How this should be done..
- I know.
He mustn't come.
Or talk.
None of our people will be involved.
Outsiders only.
We must have no association with this.
I'll take care of it.
-Surya here.
Pandian has..
- Not on the phone.
Tell me in person.
I called you so that you don't worry.
- Who asked you to come?
- He didn't say a word in court.
-I'll hang up.
Did you call me?
- You come.
- I told you to send someone for the money.
- Don't worry.
They couldn't get me there.
As if they could get me here.
Didn't you change the vehicle?
What is it?
At this time?
Hello Inspector.
No stones today?
What is the matter?
How come everyone is here so early now?
SP how come you are here so early?
Did something happen to someone?
I don't understand.
Has something happened?
Why so quiet?
!
I don't understand.
What has happened here?
Where is Surya?
What happened to him?
He got burnt badly.
Don't see it.
Along the streets of the southern city, the one who came like a deer,
Who had hit you?
Oh rising moon, do not fade.
Do not cry yourself away anymore.
The heart cannot bear any more tears.
Along the streets of the southern city, the one who came like a deer,
Who had hit you?
I'm going.
I'm leaving you and going.
I can't stay here any longer.
First you killed mother.
Now brother.
If I stay here, I will die.
I have no desire to be your child.
I will think of myself as an orphan.
I'm going back to Madras.
Don't stop me.
Or search for me.
I don't need to know whether you're alive or dead.
Leave me.
You have no wife.
Or son.
Now, forget the daughter too!
Just think you disowned me!
Leave me!
The prayer is in Charumathi's name.
Take the offerings.
- Shall I search for her?
- No.
Leave her.
I promised not to hinder.
- She might be suffering.
- She won't.
She's my child.
She'll survive.
See who it is.
If it is a new officer, tell them to let us end this first.
Tell them I said so.
- I'll take care.
- They say we don't have permission for this.
- Who must we ask?
We didn't get police permission.
- Have we ever asked for that?
I asked.
He said the mistakes of the last 30 years must end.
- Who said so?
- The new Assistant Commissioner.
These vehicles help the poor.
How can we seize them?
I know what else these are used for!
This involves Velu Naicker.
It might bring about a problem.
Who pays your salary?
The department or them?
Do it!
Who do you think we are?
Naicker will take your neck!
Yes!
We know you do that!
Who?
Who laid his hands on Selva?
!
They hit him in public and arrested him!
Aren't you ashamed to come tell me this?
What were you doing?
!
Has anyone ever touched him?
Would I ever let them do that?
!
- What does he want?
Why this arrest?
- We don't know.
Why didn't you ask?
- He hits all of our men everywhere!
- You're old.
Why didn't you ask?
- He might throw me in too.
Fear of the uniform!
Look!
These are their scars!
Feel these!
- Where is that policeman's house?
- Don't.
Why must you go there?
Who's inside?
Selva!
Who knows his house?
Who?
!
- Don't you know or are you scared?
- I know.
I didn't see any other way to dissolve the sin that I was born with.
I married an officer so that at least my child won't have the sins.
- Does he know who you..
- No.
He believes I am an orphan.
So do I.
- Your child?
Is it a son?
- Leave him.
Don't let him know you exist?
go.
Please.
- He's not here.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
I don't know!
Where is he?
- Not here.
- Where?
- I don't know!
Tell me.
Where is he hiding?
I don't know.
The police are coming!
Leave!
Leave!
The police are coming!
You still can't arrest him?
Everyone is on his side.
Today, a lady burnt herself to save him.
In front of me.
I don't understand why they respect him so much.
Maybe someone else is informing them ahead of time of your moves.
- I don't understand.
- Velu Naicker has 2 children.
Do you know?
They died in some petrol bunk accident.
The son died.
But the daughter lived.
He sent them to Madras.
Most people don't know that he has a daughter.
- The relevance?
Why did you come here?
We'll take care.
Please leave.
- What is this?
- I didn't say a word.
I don't know how I was brave.
Put him to bed.
-Are you well?
- I am fine.
I can die.
It's an honour to die for you.
- Look here.
- She's lost conciousness.
She doesn't talk at all.
She won't live past the night.
The doctor said that she won't live.
How can you be like this?
Enough!
Where is the phone?
- It's here.
- Call the AC.
- What are you going to do?
I am going to call him.
- It will make their sacrifices meaningless!
All that I've done will be meaningless.
I always felt it fine to do anything to make sure it helps others.
Now for one old man, so many people, kids.. it's not right!
Father is it you?
Is it you?
- I'm Velu here.
Is the AC in?
- Father, are you alright?
He was apparently looking for me.
Tomorrow, is my Neela's..
Tomorrow is your mother's anniversary.
Ask him to get me then.
- I won't.
- Listen to me.
- Do you know what they would do to you?
- I know.
Tell him.
- I can't!
Who?
Who was on the phone?
Who were you talking to?
My father.
- Say Velu Naicker.
Why?
What does he want?
Does he want to know when the next raid is?
Or where to hide?
!
He asked me to bring you.
He told me where he would be tomorrow.
He told you to come there and arrest him.
You need to testify against Velu Naicker.
- He named my son.
I won't.
You knew him for a long time.
You need to testify against him.
You must come and testify for us.
You don't need to be scared.We'll protect you.
Don't you know about him?
- Yes, that is why I won't testify.
Your husband?
Do you know who killed him?
Do you know?
Velu Naicker.
- I know.
- Yet you won't testify?
- No.
Why?
- He gave my son a life and made him a human being.
Please sit down.
Many have told me you don't refuse.
I need your help.
I am an ordinary man in jail.
You're an officer.
How can I help?
I thought you were a cheap man and I was desparate to put you in jail.
But when I see those who respect you as their life, I feel I am wrong.
There's one differance between me and you and what we do.
I do it wearing a uniform and you don't.
I see that and I need your help.
- You're educated and speak well.
I'm uneducated.
I will do what I can.
Tell me what it is.
The verdict is out tomorrow.
But the streets aren't calm.
If we go to stop, unnecessary lives are being lost.
You must help us to make sure court runs smoothly tomorrow.
- I..
- I believe you can do it if you wish to.
The verdict may be against you.
It may even be death.
I should have died at 10.
You won't have trouble tomorrow. go on.
I need another favour.
You must bless your grandson tomorrow.
Why are they keeping you in jail?
Did you do some wrong?
Are you a good person or a bad person?
Tell me.
Are you a good person or a bad person?
I don't know.
What is your name?
- Velu.
Shakthi Velu.
Do you know my name?
- No I don't.
I have your name too.
Shakthi Vel.
You don't worry.
Nothing will happen to you.
You go on.
Nothing will happen.We're here for you!
There wasn't enough evidence!
They can't do anything to him!
Along the streets of the southern city, the one who came like a deer,
Who had hit you?
Help the blind.
Help the blind.
Help the blind.
Help the blind.
Help the blind.
Help the blind.
Well, that's our show for tonight.
You learn anything, Mr. Rich?
Not a thing.
I'm rich because I worked hard, you're poor because you didn't.
You just weren't listening, were you?
That's why you didn't get the message.
What message?
There but for the grace of God go I.
Oh, don't give me that stuff, you bum.
That's all you are, you're just a bum.
That's right, just a bum.
You look at us and that's all you see.
You never listen.
It's easier to say we're just bums.
Just bums.
I wasn't born a bum.
Maybe I was abused when I was a child.
Maybe my parents were alcoholics or druggies.
Maybe I fought for this country and saw too much death.
Maybe I'm sick and I need help.
Maybe...
Never mind, I know.
It's easier to say we're just bums.
Come on, give him $5.
- Five dollars?
- Yeah.
He was good.
He made me cry.
- You gotta be kidding.
- Just give it to him.
Okay, but he's just gonna buy wine with it and end up in the gutter.
Go ahead.
Thank you.
Beautiful, like always, Herb.
Help the blind.
Help the blind.
- Help the blind.
- Here you go, Paulie.
It's a fiver.
Thank you, thank you, Wally.
Get a room, Paulie.
Your cough's getting worse.
Now, promise me you'll get a room.
Yeah, I promise you, Wally.
I'll get a room.
Bless you.
I'll get a room.
Oh, Paulie.
Paulie.
That him?
Yeah.
- That's Wally Dunn.
- You're sure?
I'm very sure.
All right, take it easy.
Take it easy, Long John.
I'm here, I'm here.
Hello, Long John.
Oh, boy.
Yeah, I know, I know.
I've been gone a long time.
You wait and see what I brought you.
Wait till you taste this.
Try that.
Are they good?
Is that good?
Chew on that.
Good, huh?
Yeah.
That's a cute pup.
I'm sorry if we scared you.
I just didn't hear you come in, that's all.
Mind if we sit down?
No, no, go right ahead.
Thank you.
My name's Jonathan.
This is Mark.
How you doing?
Wally Dunn.
We're fine, doing just fine.
Haven't seen you around.
Yeah, well, we just got in.
What's the pup's name?
I call him Long John Silver on account of this bad leg here.
Found him about a week ago.
Put a splint on that.
I don't know, must have got hit or something.
I hate to leave him in this old suitcase when I'm gone so long, but he's not in much shape to go running around on his own.
Look...
If you want booze or money, I can save you a lot of trouble.
I haven't got any.
I've got some groceries I'd be happy to share.
That's very kind of you.
Don't mention it.
We got some...
Got some chilli, got some crackers and got some apple juice here too.
Sounds good.
Thank you.
Why are you doing this, Wally?
- Doing what?
- Sharing your food.
We're strangers.
You don't even know us.
You're hungry, ain't you?
Wouldn't make any difference whether I know you or not.
You know, people can't be strangers after they break bread together.
No.
After that, they've gotta be friends.
Help yourself to them crackers.
What's funny, Wally?
I heard a story about a man who met Long John Silver.
And he said, "John," he says,
"I noticed that peg leg there, what happened to you?"
He said, "Sea battle."
He said, "Cannonball took it right off."
He said, "Why, heavens, that's just terrible."
He said, "I noticed you got that hook there too.
You lose your hand in a battle?"
He says, "Yeah, another battle.
Cutlass, whack, took it right off."
And he says, "Why, that's just awful." He said,
"That patch on your eye?
You lose your eye too?"
He says, "No, no battle."
He said, "Seagull flew over...right in me eye."
And the man says,
"You're trying to tell me that a seagull did that and took your eye out?"
He says, "No.
You see, it was the first day I was wearing me hook."
- It's a good one.
- Not bad at all.
Wally, you all right?
Fine, go ahead.
No, I'm just saying blessing.
Lord, thank you for this food and for this company and for this beautiful day.
And especially, thank you for warming up the night like this.
It helps your children out there on the street.
And, Lord, help them to get to know you.
They need you a lot.
I love you, Lord.
Amen.
Amen.
Morning, Wally.
Oh, morning.
I'm sorry if I woke you.
It's Friday.
I've gotta get an early start on Fridays.
Where you going?
Make my rounds, visit friends.
Today I go across town.
There's a little boy used to come and see my puppet show every day after school.
Real sick now, so I go see him on Fridays.
I'd go every day but these old legs just can't do it anymore.
- Hey, Wally.
- Morning.
Hey, look what I found.
I think that collar's small enough to fit your pup.
You won't have to leave him in the suitcase anymore.
Yeah, that's real nice.
I can't take him on my rounds, though.
Some of the places I go don't allow any dogs, barely allow me.
Well, that's a shame.
It's gonna get awful hot in this boxcar today.
Hey, look, why don't we go along with you?
We can keep the pup outside for you.
Oh, I'm going a long way.
You sure?
We got nothing but time.
All right, then.
Long John, this is your lucky day.
Stevie...
Come on, try and sip a little soda.
- It will help your stomach.
- No, I don't want it.
You need to take some liquids.
I can't.
Stomach's too sick.
That's Wally.
Do you want me to tell him you're not feeling well?
- No, I wanna see him.
- Honey, you're sick.
Yeah, Mom, just for a while.
All right.
Hi, Mrs. Markham.
Oh, hello, Wally.
These are a couple of friends.
Jonathan and Mark.
- How are you?
- Hi.
Hello.
Well, won't you come in?
Listen, I think I better stay out here.
I'm not sure that this little dog is fully housebroken.
- Oh, well, we won't be long.
- Take your time.
How is the little guy?
His stomach's real upset.
He just had a round of therapy.
It's real hard on him.
Doctor say anything?
Well, that's the last of the treatments.
At least he won't have to be in that hospital...
Why don't you just go on in?
When I grow up I want to be a very famous clown
And have the people laugh at me When the circus comes to town
I'll make them glad When they are sad
I'll chase away each frown
I'll blink my nose and tip my hat When the circus comes to town
And when you hear the old calliope You'll watch me and you'll laugh
I'll roll like a wheel And honk like a seal
And stretch my neck Like a big giraffe
I hope you'll see me when I'm shown When I become a clown
Next year when I am fully grown
And the circus comes to town
- Hi, kid.
- Hi, Wally.
- Say hi to Jonathan.
- Hi.
Hi, Stevie.
- Mom says your stomach is lousy.
- It's not so bad.
Hey, you don't have to play Superman with me, you know.
Everybody's got a right to complain if they feel bad.
I know.
I'm just so tired of feeling bad.
Yeah, I know, kid.
So how are things on the street?
Well, let's see.
- You remember Margaret?
- Sure.
The lady that always had that big pumpkin in her shopping cart.
Right.
Well, she finally got herself into the detox centre and she's doing pretty good.
Even got herself a job down at the bus station, running the concession stand.
That's great.
She's nice.
Come back here.
Where did you come from?
Hey, Long John, are you getting in trouble?
I'm sorry.
He slipped right out of his collar.
So that's the pup you found.
May I hold him?
- Sure.
- He's cute.
His leg must be getting better, jumping in here like that.
Yeah, must be.
He's so cute.
I always wanted a puppy like this.
Well, why don't you ask your mom?
You know, needs a home.
- No.
- Why not?
- It wouldn't be fair to him.
- Why?
He's just a pup.
He's gonna live a long time.
And I'm...
It just wouldn't be fair.
You're sure everything you told me is true?
Would an angel lie to you?
I thought nobody was supposed to know but me and you?
It's okay, it's okay.
They're angels too.
They are?
Are you really an angel?
Will you swear?
Swear to God, Stevie.
I'm an angel.
Gee.
Gee.
You know, Wally,
I wanted to believe you about heaven and all, but I was still a little...
- You know.
- Yeah, I know, kid.
Now I know for sure.
You still can't tell anybody.
I mean, this is still between you and me.
It's our secret.
Oh, I know.
I won't.
Tell me again what it's gonna be like.
Well...
It will be like being a bird flying, free and happy.
Wind blowing in your face, and joy in your heart.
No more pain, Wally?
No.
No, kid.
No more pain.
It's heaven.
Yeah.
Heaven.
He's asleep.
I hope you don't mind me saying you was angels too.
It's hard to make a kid believe something he can't see.
We didn't mind.
Yeah, good.
I don't guess he'd be angry at a little white lie like that.
- Believe me, the boss understands.
- Boss?
I mean, God.
Oh, yeah.
Never heard it put that way before.
Well, we'd better get started.
I have to be at the home by 3.
- The home?
- Old folks.
Them and kids, my best audience.
No doubt about it.
Wally's the one, all right.
You bet he is.
Hi-diddle-dee-dee An actor's life for me
A high silk hat and a silver cane A watch of gold with a diamond chain
Hi-diddle-dee-do You sleep till after 2
You promenade with a big cigar You tour the world in a private car
You dine on chicken and caviar An actor's life for me
Thank you.
We thank you.
- Boy, they really love him, don't they?
- They should.
It's been three years now, three times a week.
No matter what the weather, Wally's here.
He's the most special person I've ever met.
See you in a couple of days.
Now, you be good.
- You were great as always, Wally.
- Yeah?
Thank you, Agnes.
Listen, I wanna go up and see Sylvia now.
- Who's Sylvia?
- Old friend from the street.
You guys can come along if you want.
Hi, Sylv.
Miss me?
I miss you too.
Oh, these are my friends, Jonathan and Mark.
Pleased to meet you.
Sylvie can't talk or anything.
She had a bad stroke.
Yeah, real bad.
Things just aren't the same on the street without her.
Always had a smile and a joke, didn't you, Sylv?
They treating you good?
You sure now?
Boy, I'll give them what for if they don't.
Food okay and everything?
Paul and Herb and all the gang said to say hi to you.
They love you.
Yeah, I'll tell them you love them too.
I'll see you Monday, okay?
Bye, Sylv.
Poor old gal.
Does she know what you're saying to her?
Oh, yeah.
Didn't you see her blink?
One blink for yes, two blinks for no.
That's our code.
We were real close.
Look at this picture she gave me.
She's about 15 then.
- That's her?
- Beautiful, isn't she?
How does somebody like this, you know...?
- How'd she end up on the street?
- Yeah.
Well, the day before her sweet-16 birthday party, her father molested her.
You know, in those days, nobody told kids to speak up.
It was her father, after all.
She was afraid and confused.
It went on for a long time.
She finally just fell apart.
She was in and out of mental hospitals.
Some of them not so good either.
And after her stroke, I put her in here.
I mean, she just couldn't make it on the street anymore.
You mean, you pay for this place?
Me and some of the other guys have a few bucks.
You know, I do pretty good with my puppet show.
Yeah, then why do you live in a boxcar?
I can't pay rent and keep her in here.
But, you know, I've been on the street a long, long time.
I'm kind of used to it now.
You really are amazing, Wally, the way you do for people.
Why shouldn't I?
I mean, I'm one of the lucky ones.
You know, I've been blessed, you know.
I know.
I don't know where he gets that energy.
He's packing up to go do his show.
Hey, you all right?
Yeah.
Really makes you think, doesn't it?
I've been patting myself on the back about travelling around the country with you trying to help people.
Then you meet a guy like Wally and...
And what?
I don't know.
It just makes you feel kind of guilty, you know?
I cried because I had no shoes until I met a man who had no feet.
Yeah.
Don't feel guilty, my friend.
Wally's not like you and me.
We could try our whole time on this Earth and not begin to be half the person he is.
See, he doesn't know it yet, but he wasn't lying when he told that little boy he was an angel.
Hi-diddle-dee-dee An actor's life for me
A high silk hat and a silver cane A watch of gold with a diamond chain
Hi-diddle-dee-do You sleep till after 2

Hello, Wally, my love.
Mar-?
Oh, Margaret.
What are you doing?
What do you mean what am I doing?
I'm talking to you.
Are you drunk, Wally?
Margaret, you were doing so good, your job...
- I don't have a job.
- They fire you?
No.
I quit it, Wally.
Why?
Why would you do a thing like that?
Because I don't deserve it.
I'm nothing, Wally.
I'm just a stupid, ugly person and I don't deserve anything except my pumpkin.
I have a pumpkin, Wally.
That's one thing I always wanted when I was a kid.
Now I've got one of my very own.
I'm out of Night Train.
I'll see you, Wally.
I thought she was gonna make it this time.
She had her chance.
Yeah.
But she hates herself too much to take it.
The liquor store.
- Margaret.
- That's five times I've been robbed.
You ask for more police, they say, "We ain't got them."
Well, I'll tell you, next time I'll kill.
I'm not taking this anymore.
- You hear me?
- Be quiet, will you?
- Wally?
- I'm right here.
He shot me, Wally.
He just turned around and shot me.
An ambulance is on the way, Margaret.
Oh, no.
I don't need an ambulance.
I don't want anybody to go to all that trouble.
- I'm not worth it, Wally.
- Oh, yes, you are, Margaret.
You're more than worth it.
You're the best.
- You always tell me that, Wally.
- That's because it's true.
You're a wonderful person.
Sweet Wally.
You take care of my pumpkin, okay?
The ambulance is almost here.
No need.
I feel funny, Wally.
Now I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
You know what I wish?
What?
I wish...
I wish I could have gotten Margaret to believe that she was a wonderful person.
That she was somebody of worth.
That she was loved.
I wish she could have believed that.
She believes it now.
What?
She's with our Father, Wally.
She feels loved now.
Far more than she ever could have felt here on Earth.
You really believe that, don't you?
You're really sure of it.
Yeah.
I wanna believe that.
I wanna believe that everything I feel inside is true.
But sometimes, when things happen,
I wonder...
You wonder why?
Yes, why?
Why Margaret?
Why couldn't she be happy?
She went through so much.
She never hurt anybody but herself.
Because she couldn't accept the love that she needed.
Not yours, not God's.
None of us can make it alone, Wally.
None of us are strong enough.
Don't be afraid to believe what you feel in your heart.
There's more truth there than you'll ever find in your mind.
You're really sure, aren't you, about all that?
Wally, I'm very sure.
How?
How can you be so sure?
Because I've touched the face of God.
I think I'll go to sleep now.
First of the month comes awful quick these days.
My life insurance payment.
I didn't think you had a family, Wally.
It's for Sylvie.
Just in case anything happens, you know.
It's enough to keep her taken care of.
What would the world do without Wally Dunn?
I'm sure it'd do quite well.
Mind if we tag along with you?
Well, that depends on your feet.
I'm going across town to visit Stevie again.
I thought you only went to see him on Fridays.
Well, I do, but he's having a tough time right now.
I wanna make sure he's doing all right.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
I know what you mean.
Wally, this little pup is sure walking a lot better.
Yeah, like all young ones.
They heal quick when you give them half a chance.
I should have that splint off in a couple--
Stevie.
Officer, was that the Markham boy?
Yeah, he went into a coma this morning.
What hospital?
St. James, but I'd save yourself a trip.
Poor kid.
I gotta see him.
Excuse me.
How would I find a patient named Stevie Markham?
- Are you a relative?
- No, friend.
- I'm sorry, then.
You can't-
- But I have to see him.
I said, I'm sorry, but those are the rules.
Relatives only.
- Why?
- Why what?
Why is that the rule?
People wanna see their friends.
They don't always wanna see their relatives.
That may be true, but it--
Look, I'll vouch for the man.
I'm a doctor.
Sure you are.
Here's my identification.
If you'll look under the Markham boy's name, you'll find out he's my patient.
IV Nurse to 4 West, stat.
Yes, Dr. Smith.
I'm sorry, I...
Why are you dressed that way?
I don't overcharge my patients.
Intensive Care Unit, third floor.
I'll notify them that you're here.
Thank you very much.
Mrs. Markham.
Wally.
I just heard about Stevie.
How is he?
He's in a coma and they don't...
They don't expect him to come out of it.
Sixth Floor Nursing Supervisor, please call your office.
Sixth Floor Nursing Supervisor, call your office.
Could I see him?
Oh, yes, but he won't know you're there.
I just wanna see him.
Okay.
Paging Mr. Farrell.
Mr. Bob Farrell.
Paging Mr. Farrell.
I'll just wait out here.
First Margaret, now my little Stevie.
God, please, not this boy.
You've worked miracles before.
Work one now.
Let him live.
His life...
It's just beginning.
Please, God.
God, take me instead.
My life's nearly over.
It's been full.
Please, let him live.
I think I'd like to be alone if it's all right.
It's tonight, isn't it?
Yeah.
I know that's the way it's supposed to be, Jonathan, but isn't there a chance?
No, Mark.
Wally's one of the chosen ones.
His prayer will be answered tonight.
You just weren't listening.
That's why you didn't get the message.
What message?
There but for the grace of God go I.
Don't give me that stuff, you bum.
That's all you are, you're just a bum.
Sure, just a bum.
All right, Paulie, that will be a dollar-three, now.
All right, John, now-
- All right, I'm taking a quarter here.
- I'm listening to you count.
- That's 25, 50, 75.
- Twenty-five, all right.
All right, leave it open.
Come on, give me all the bills, man.
Now, come on, move it.
Hurry up.
- No, you drop it.
- Hey.
- Stop it.
- You can't stop me.
- I ain't getting robbed no more.
- You don't shoot.
- I'm not getting robbed anymore.
- Put it down.
- You don't shoot, I don't shoot.
- I'm blowing you away.
- Get me, I get--
- I don't shoot.
- Shut up.
- Now, you put it down.
It's easier to say we're just bums.
He's got a gun.
He's got Paulie.
- Drop it.
No, you drop it.
- Put it down.
I'm not gonna drop it.
- Put the gun down.
- Not Paulie, not Paulie.
Put it down.
Oh, Lord.
Somebody get an ambulance.
Get an ambulance quick.
Come on, somebody call an ambulance, please!
Somebody call an ambulance, please!
Wally.
Wally.
Jonathan.
You were a real hero tonight, Wally.
- Paulie, is he okay?
- Paulie's fine.
Thank God.
When I saw that gun holding him, all I could think about was Margaret and Stevie and now Paulie.
All the people I love.
And they love you, Wally.
I'm hurt bad, huh?
Yeah.
I don't feel any pain.
- How's he doing?
- He's delirious.
He's talking to himself.
What's he talking about delirious?
- I'm talking to my friend here.
- He can't see me, Wally.
What?
They can't see me or hear me.
Jonathan, you've been drinking some of that cheap wine.
No, Wally.
I'm an angel.
An angel?
- An angel?
- That's right.
You're not kidding, are you?
No, Wally, I'm not kidding.
So that's it.
In the hospital, your name was on that list.
When we were talking to Stevie about being angels, you said, "Swear to God."
You weren't lying, were you?
No, I wasn't lying.
And you know.
Because you touched the face of God.
And so will you tonight.
And when you do, your prayer will be answered.
Prayer?
See, I'm an angel now, but you've been an angel your whole life.
And because of that, your special prayer will be answered.
It's little Stevie.
He's not gonna die?
Oh, no.
He's gonna live, Wally.
And it's all true.
Just the way you always knew it was in your heart.
Give me your hand, Wally.
Jonathan.
Jonathan.
Our Father...
Slow down, Harry.
He's gone.
Poor old guy.
Just a bum who wasted his life.
Mr. and Mrs. Markham, come quick.
- What is it?
- Stevie, he's out of the coma.
He's calling for you.
Oh, my God.
Mark, Jonathan, come in.
- How you doing?
- I'm doing just fine.
- How's Stevie?
- Oh, healthy and hungry.
It's a miracle.
I mean, the doctors, everybody, that's all they can say.
I mean, it's not just remission.
It's gone.
I mean, it just has to be a miracle.
There's just no other explanation.
No, there isn't.
Look, we promised Wally we'd bring this pup by.
Stevie loved him.
He was just afraid to take him before because...
I know.
Poor, sweet Wally.
I haven't told Stevie yet.
I just couldn't.
He loved that man so.
Mom.
John Silver.
Wally said you had him out here.
- What?
- Wally's going on a long trip.
He stopped by to say so long and he said you were bringing the pup over.
Stevie, Wally couldn't have come by.
Well, he did, Mom.
He's in my room.
Come and see for yourself.
Wally!
Wally!
He said he was in a hurry.
Guess he had to go.
He said he was taking a real special trip.
Stevie, I think you're letting your imagination run away a little bit.
I am not.
I'll prove it.
Look what he gave me.
His name's Wally too.
I wasn't born a bum.
Maybe.
Never mind.
I know.
It's easier to say we're just bums.
What are you doing home, Gary?
I said, what are you doing home, Gary?
What are you doing home, Gary?
When a mother asks a question, she expects an answer.
I didn't know you asked a question.
I had the shower running.
I asked why you're home so early.
Can I finish my shower first?
Then we'll talk.
We'll talk now.
You haven't said a word to me in two weeks.
All of a sudden, I don't have a chance to finish a shower?
Why are you home?
I got fired.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
God.
Oh, Ma, please, will you stop with the "Oh, my Gods" and heavy breathing?
I'll get another job.
Oh, my God, you'll get another job.
Simple.
A job like that's not easy to come by.
Oh, my God.
Ma, come on, please, will you stop it?
Just forget it.
Forget it.
That's all I've heard all my life from you and your father.
You're the same as he was.
It's easy for you to talk.
You're not the one who has to worry.
That's right, Mom.
I'm just the one that has to work.
What does that mean?
- You expect me to work?
- I didn't say that.
Fine, I'll work.
It doesn't matter that I'm sick, if I get a job, it'll kill me.
Ma, you don't have to get a job.
You own this building, remember?
Now, please, stop bugging me.
My son...
I promise you your mother will never bug you again.
Goodbye, my son.
Do we have any of that pizza left?
We must have some.
Two of us couldn't have eaten a whole large onion and pepperoni.
Here it is.
You know, you're not impressing me with this.
I mean, why are you doing it?
You need something with a little more shock value.
You know, until the time I was 10,
I thought the only thing that went inside an oven was my mother's head.
Would you mind if we shared?
I can put the pizza on the top shelf and you can leave your head on the bottom.
You don't even care.
Your own mother, and you don't care.
I'd care if there was something to care about, but you're not gonna kill yourself.
You know it and I know it.
You're just like your father.
Thank you.
My son?
Yeah, Mom.
How much pizza do we have left?
There's plenty for both of us.
Excuse me, do you mind if I sit here?
- No, it's okay.
- Thanks.
First time in L.A., huh?
Yeah.
How'd you know?
Well, you got an L.A. paper, classified, apartment rentals.
Sherlock Holmes stuff.
I can't believe how expensive these places are.
Yeah, tell me about it.
First and last month's rent, plus a deposit?
It's murder.
My buddy lives in L.A. He found me a place in his building.
Pretty reasonable rates, supposed to be good-sized apartments.
You're lucky.
Hey, you know, he's gonna meet me at the bus depot.
We can ask him, there might be another vacancy in the building.
Oh, that's all right.
Thanks anyway.
I'm not a dirty old man, you know.
I'm just trying to help.
- I guess it couldn't hurt to ask him.
- Okay.
This is a bedroom.
And this is a bathroom.
And plenty of closets.
Nice and spacious.
You don't get that in the newer buildings.
It's very nice.
Yeah, so I'll need first and last and a cleaning deposit.
Oh, and no children.
You don't have any children, do you?
No.
No, I don't.
Good, you're better off.
The rent is 480 a month.
Wait a minute, I only pay 325.
That's this month.
I had to raise all the rents.
What?
You mean my rent is going up to 480?
That's right.
Well, that's a little too steep for me.
- Thanks.
- Hey, I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Alice.
Hey, look, Mark and I were just talking.
Well, there's no way either one of us can afford $480 a month rent either.
So since the apartments are so big, I'm just gonna move in with him.
I've already paid the first and last month's rent on the place so you're welcome to use it until you find something.
- Are you kidding?
- No, I'm not kidding.
I mean, there's no way Mrs. Davis is gonna give me my money back.
What do you say?
What can I say?
Thank you.
Jonathan, would you mind my asking why we are standing out here at quarter to 1 in the morning?
Waiting for the other half of our assignment.
Well, I wish they'd get here soon.
I could use some sleep, you know?
Looks like your wish has been granted.
- Easy, Gary, easy.
I got you.
- Do I know you?
Yeah, Jonathan Smith, new tenant.
You know Mark Gordon, right?
Yeah, come on.
Let's get you inside.
- Hey, I'm bleeding.
- You'll live.
Come on, come on, come on.
All right.
- Wait, no, no, no.
Come on, this way.
- He lives upstairs.
I know that.
Come on.
You're just fine.
You're all right.
Okay, put him right here.
Jonathan, she shouldn't see him like this.
Who's the angel here?
All right.
Let's go.
My God, you're bleeding.
Do you want me to call a doctor?
No, I don't have Medicare.
Call a priest.
You're okay, then.
I'm fantastic.
- Well, good night, then.
- Good night, then.
Are you still there?
Yes.
Could I come into your room and wash up?
This person I live with upstairs gets very emotional.
It's very late.
She's probably worried about you.
No, she doesn't-
- She doesn't worry, she just gets emotional.
If I died, it'd probably ruin her whole day.
Can I come in and wash up?
Okay.
- The bathroom's over there.
- Well, it has to be.
In this apartment house, every bathroom's over there.
- How'd it happen?
- A fight.
Four or five guys jumped me.
That's terrible.
Yeah, it's also a lie.
Some garbage cans, I drove into them.
- Gary Davis.
- Who?
- Me, my name, Gary Davis.
- I'm Alice.
What are you, a stripper?
What?
Well, strippers only have one name.
Alice, Dee Dee, Sandra.
Hartman, Alice Hartman.
Well, it's a pleasure, Alice Hartman.
And thank you.
You know, you shouldn't let strange men in your apartment.
You didn't seem that strange.
- You're cute.
- You're drunk.
You're right.
Good night.
The pregnancy is coming along perfectly normal.
I want you to keep taking the vitamins, two a day with meals.
And your weight's fine so I'm not gonna give you any no-noes about eating.
Both the letter I received from your mother and from your family doctor stated that you wanted to give the child up for adoption.
Do you still intend to go through with that?
Yes.
You've contacted an attorney to handle the adoption for you?
No.
I was going to, but I didn't know anyone and there were so many names, I just--
I understand.
I'll recommend someone, if you like.
It might simplify matters for you.
His name is Lou Graham.
Here's his number.
He's a good man.
I think you might like him.
Do you think what I'm doing is wrong?
No.
No, I don't.
But the right or wrong of it only pertains to how it affects you.
My mom and I talked, and I guess this is the best way.
What did your dad think?
He doesn't know about it.
Mom thought it was best if he didn't.
I'm in Europe now, seeing the world.
Two months is a long time not to hear from your daughter.
Oh, he gets a postcard every week from Europe.
You just send them in to those mailing places and they mail them for you.
It's really better if he doesn't know.
All right.
I wanna see you again in two weeks, okay?
And be sure you keep taking the vitamins.
I will, doctor.
Thank you.
- Hey, Alice, how you doing?
- Oh, fine.
- What's this?
- I don't know.
Your assignment, Alice, if you wanna take it, is to have a crummy pizza at a drive-in movie tonight.
If you wish to accept the assignment, leave this rose outside your door.
Gary Davis, over and out.
Well, look at that.
You're in town for one day
- and you've already got an admirer.
- Some admirer.
I found him leaning on my door last night, drunk as a skunk.
Well, you can't always judge people by first meetings.
We all have our bad days, don't we?
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess we do.
He's really a nice guy.
He just hasn't found the right person to put some meaning in his life.
The right person?
I'm afraid most of the time, they turn out to be the wrong person.
Well, doesn't mean we should stop trying.
We all get hurt sometimes, it's part of living.
- Well, I gotta be going.
I'll see you.
- Bye.
Ma.
Hey, Ma.
In here, my son.
- Hello, my son.
- Have you been in bed all day?
Oh, I've had trouble catching my breath.
It's no wonder.
You got the windows closed.
The light.
Will you stop acting like a vampire?
I got a job.
You got a job?
What job?
- I said, what job?
- Construction.
Now, will you let me get ready?
I've got a date.
He really pinched her head off, didn't he?
Hey.
- Come back.
- I'm sorry.
- Want some corn?
- A little.
What were you thinking about?
I--I--I don't even know.
I'll bet I know.
You're thinking you've been in town a couple of days, and here you are on a date with some yo-yo, takes you to a drive-in horror movie.
Am I right?
I'm right.
Come on, be honest.
You're not right.
Then what are you laughing at?
I don't know.
I really--I don't know.
- I'm freezing.
- I'll get us some towels.
Got it.
- Thanks.
- I love you.
I really do.
I really do love you.
Well, come on, take me off the hook.
Say something.
I'm pregnant.
What?
I'm seven months pregnant.
What's the matter?
You got problems?
Yeah, the damn thing won't start.
- I'm gonna be late for work.
- Come on, I'll give you a lift.
I'm going all the way to Inglewood.
No problem, come on.
How are things going with you and Alice?
What?
I see you two together all the time.
Thought you might be getting serious.
Yeah, well, we're not.
We're not even seeing each other anymore.
- Sorry to hear that.
She's a nice girl.
- Yeah.
- What happened?
- I appreciate the ride and everything, but that's really none of your business.
That's true.
She's pregnant.
Yeah, I know.
Well, if you knew, then how come you asked me how things were going?
I couldn't believe it when she told me that.
Well, now you know how Joseph felt.
Joseph?
Well, Joseph.
In the Bible.
Joseph.
Yeah, well, this was no immaculate conception, pal.
You love her?
No.
I mean, I did, but how can I love her now?
Well, why not?
She's the same person you fell in love with.
No, she's not.
She's pregnant.
She was pregnant when you met her.
The only difference is, now you know.
If you're gonna base your relationships with people on things they did before you met them, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble.
Let's face it, you were no thrill before you two got together.
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about you.
You were an irresponsible jerk until you met Alice.
You've changed a lot in these past few weeks.
Haven't you?
- Haven't you?
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Why?
What changed you?
- I don't know.
Yeah, well, I do.
You finally met someone that made you feel good about yourself.
Somebody you wanted to be proud of you.
Just drop it, would you?
Just drop it.
- Well, there you go.
- Yeah, thanks for the lift.
Gary?
If you love her, don't throw it away because of ego or false pride.
It's not easy to find a girl like Alice.
Thanks for the lift.
I tell you, Estelle, you spend your whole life worrying.
First they go out every night, stay out till all hours, never bother to call.
You spend half the time thinking they're dead, lying dead, murdered in a ditch somewhere.
Then, next thing, they don't go anywhere.
They sit and stare at TV.
You ask them what's wrong, they say nothing's wrong.
As if a mother wouldn't know what's wrong.
Oh, well, what am I telling you for?
You know, you got a son.
How is Johnny?
Oh, he is?
Doing that well?
How long has he been with that company?
Three months.
You should be proud.
Well, I'll let you go, Estelle.
Give my best to everybody.
I will.
You too.
Bye.
Do you know who I was just talking to?
Estelle.
Guess what her son, Johnny, is doing.
He's doing very well.
- Do you know what I'm wondering?
- You're wondering what's wrong.
You wanna tell me?
Yeah, the picture tube's starting to go.
Come on, where are my keys?
Kind of a lousy night for a drive, isn't it?
Who cares?
Are you going out to get drunk again?
It's none of your business what I do.
What are you butting in for anyway?
Because I'm your friend.
I think people sometimes need people to talk to.
Yeah, well, I don't.
But if you really wanna help, figure out where my keys are.
- They're in Alice's apartment.
- What?
I helped her carry some groceries.
Put your keys on the mantel.
You left them in the ignition.
- You took my car keys?
- Yeah, I took your car keys.
I was afraid somebody might steal that beauty.
You know, you're really starting to bug me.
Now, get me my car keys.
You want your car keys, you get them yourself.
You know where they are.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Look, sorry to bother you, but Jonathan left my keys on your mantel.
- He put them there for some reason.
- Oh, let me look.
- Yeah, here they are.
- Thanks.
How you been?
Fine.
You?
Real good.
I'm sorry.
No reason to be sorry.
I missed you.
I missed you too.
Look, when you told me, I didn't know-
I don't blame you.
I would have probably done the same thing.
Can I come in?
I just wanna be with you.
Okay.
We've reunited our couples.
And now, gentlemen, we've recorded your predictions on cards.
You have them in front of you.
Ladies, it's nice to have you.
- Here's your question.
- What about the guy?
- What?
- The guy.
What did he have to say about the baby and all?
The night I told him, he was very upset.
He said no one was gonna take our child away.
And he went home to work things out.
I phoned the next day and his phone was disconnected.
And I went by his apartment and he'd moved.
I don't really blame him.
I mean, what would you do if a girl told you she was going to have a baby?
You did, and I didn't move.
My hero.
What is it?
The baby kicked.
Give me your hand.
Here, feel.
- I don't feel anything.
- Just wait.
- I told you.
- Hey.
Yeah, he really moves around in there.
Hey, there it goes again.
That's fantastic.
This is nothing.
Just wait another month and see.
Yeah.
What's wrong?
Why does everybody always ask me that?
I'm sorry, you just got so quiet.
I mean, what am I doing here anyway?
Sitting around watching television and feeling some baby kick in your stomach.
You're the one that wanted to come in.
I know that.
I just don't know why.
- This is stupid.
- Then why don't you leave?
That's what I'm doing.
I'll pick you up tomorrow night at 8.
We'll have some dinner.
Okay.
All right, we'll get right down to cases.
I will be acting as your attorney in this matter.
Another attorney will handle the adopting parents.
It's a matter of protection for the adopting couple.
They will pay all attorney fees, all medical and hospital bills.
Any money spent by you up to this point will be reimbursed.
- That's not necessary.
- Well, it's standard.
They will also pay an amount that we determine adequate to keep you going till you get back on your feet.
I'll be going home right after.
Well, as I said, we can determine an amount you feel you need.
I see.
Will I know who gets my baby?
I mean, will I know what kind of people they are?
Yes, certainly.
You'll receive a full background on them.
And of course, they will want all the usual information on you and the child's father.
Here.
Here are some papers that you can fill out, take home with you.
Just drop them in the mail to me.
I'd also like a photograph of you and the child's father.
I don't have a picture of him.
Can you get one?
I don't know.
Well, it would help us.
It gives the adopting parents a feeling of security knowing what the mother and the father look like.
I see.
I'll do my best.
Good.
Any questions?
No.
Then I think that does it for now.
We'll try to make this whole matter as comfortable as we can for you.
Thank you.
If you do have any questions, something you happen to think of later,
- just give me a call.
- I will.
Have a good day.
Yeah.
Hey, kemosabe, you know something?
That Mrs. Davis up there is a sweet woman.
I can't understand why Gary thinks she's weird.
Well, sometimes people act a little differently with their relatives.
Yeah.
Do you know that he has not told her one word about Alice?
I'll bet she doesn't even know they're seeing each other.
Yeah, I'll bet you're right.
Shame to keep something like that from her.
I'll tell you one thing, I could talk to that woman about anything.
Really?
I'll keep that in mind.
- What a day that was, huh?
- Yeah.
- You wanna stop and get a cold one?
- No, thanks.
Oh, you seen the new waitress at Artie's?
- No.
- Oh, you gotta check this one out.
Come on, I'm buying.
I gotta get going.
Oh, you got a heavy date, huh?
Yeah.
Very heavy.
The door's open.
Come on in.
I'm ready.
Your letters fooled me for a while.
But your mother kept crying over nothing.
She finally told me.
How do you feel?
All right.
- You look tired.
- I'm fine, really.
- How's Mom?
- How do you think she is?
I'm sorry.
The time for being sorry's long past.
Why?
I asked myself that 100 times on the plane.
Why?
- It just happened.
- That's no answer.
If it's too late to be asking why, it's certainly too late to be sorry.
Who was the boy?
Does it matter?
No.
I wish I hadn't found out.
I wish the lie had worked.
And everything would be the same as it was.
I guess all fathers know that things go on.
But as long as you don't know for sure, you can pretend your little girl
is still your little girl.
You have enough money?
Yes.
Need anything?
No.
I'll be going, then.
Bye.
What's going on?
- Who was that?
- My father.
He was so pathetic.
I felt so sorry for him.
- What'd he say?
- Not much of anything.
He looked so old.
God, I wish he hadn't found out.
Tough.
- What?
- Tough.
I mean, what the hell did he come here for anyway?
Just to make you feel worse than you did before?
- You wouldn't understand.
- The hell I wouldn't.
He just came here to lay all the guilt on you so that he wouldn't have to carry any of it.
That's a stupid thing to say.
Yeah, well, I think your old man's stupid.
If I love somebody, I let them know I love them.
I don't make them feel lousy and then take off on them.
I told you you wouldn't understand.
You never loved anyone.
Yeah, maybe not, but I'm here, ain't I?
He made me feel so bad.
I know, but he knows now.
He'll get over it.
I wanted him to hold me and tell me everything was all right.
I told you.
I'll be here as much as you want.
Hey, Gary.
It's Alice, her water just broke.
Oh, my God.
It was a boy.
I know, they told me downstairs.
- How do you feel?
- All right.
Did they say anything about the baby?
The usual.
Healthy, everything's fine.
That's good.
You been here all the time?
- Yeah, Jonathan gave me a ride over.
- I bet you're tired.
No, I took a nap down in the lobby.
I didn't know what to get you so I got you some magazines and some candy.
Sounds good.
- Hello.
- Hello, doctor.
- Relax.
I'm Dr. Newman.
- Gary Davis.
I just wanted to see how you're feeling.
I'm fine, kind of groggy.
- My mouth's dry.
- The anaesthetic.
Sleep a little and you'll be all set.
I'm tired.
- I'll stop by later.
- Don't go yet.
You heard the doctor.
I'll see you in a little while.
Get some sleep.
- Doctor?
- Yes?
How's the baby?
How does he look?
He's a healthy boy.
Just get some sleep.
I kept her off the maternity floor.
Hard for them when other babies are being brought into the room.
- Hi, doc.
- Hi, Lou.
- Do you know each other?
- I'm Lou Graham, Alice's attorney.
- Oh, yeah.
Gary Davis.
- She didn't wanna see the baby.
Yeah, I know.
Dr. Newman, telephone.
- I gotta run.
- Yeah.
- See you.
- How is she feeling?
So-so, you know.
She'll be all right.
If you'd like to meet the adopting parents, they're in the nursery.
- I'm sure they'd like to talk to you.
- What for?
Well, seeing a picture of the child's father is one thing.
But actually getting a chance to talk to him, that's something else.
They get a general idea of what you're like.
Would you care to go up?
Would you care to go up and talk with them?
No, no, I gotta get going.
What's with her giving them my picture?
They wanted a picture and she didn't have one of the child's father.
Yeah, well, she shouldn't have done it.
He's not my kid.
Of course not, it's just Alice's.
Damn elevator.
Look, why don't you go up and see him?
- What for?
- Aren't you at least curious?
It's the child of the woman you're supposed to be in love with.
Well, fine.
You know, the kid's gonna get adopted, why look?
Come on.
Finally.
Come on, what could it hurt taking a look at him?
Mr. Davis.
Gary, this is Mr. and Mrs. Mal Wallace.
A pleasure to meet you.
I'll leave you three to talk.
I'll be right down the hall.
Oh, he's adorable, isn't he?
We'll give the child a good home.
- Are your parents living, Mr. Davis?
- What?
Are your parents living?
My mother is.
I don't know about my father.
He took off when Ma cracked up.
Your mother had a breakdown of some sort?
No, not a breakdown.
She went bananas.
She's been in a mental institution about eight years now.
Well, I'm very sorry.
Well, that's life, you know.
Nothing you can do when it's in the genes.
Her whole family wasn't too stable.
Well, I better be going now.
You know how parole officers are.
You miss one appointment, you're right back in.
A pleasure meeting you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I thought you went home.
- Well, I changed my mind.
Beautiful day.
I hadn't noticed.
Sun shining, no smog.
You couldn't ask for a better day.
You're sure in a good mood.
Well, why shouldn't I be?
Are you in a bad mood?
God, yes, I'm in a bad mood.
Here he is.
He's beautiful, isn't he?
Yes, he is.
He's part of you.
That's why he's beautiful.
I don't wanna give him up.
Well, I've been through this whole pregnancy thing with you.
I've got some say in it.
I think we should take him home and get married.
Well, you love me, don't you?
And you know darn right well I love you too, don't you?
If you're mine, he's mine.
Hey, Jonathan, would you mind telling my mother what's happening?
It might be easier coming from a stranger.
I know just the person for the job.
Congratulations.
- Mrs. Davis, it's Mark.
- Oh, Mark, it's open.
Listen, you better wait out here.
Hey, are you sure?
Maybe I ought to go in with you.
Jonathan, I'm sure.
Will you let me handle this?
Come on, I got this woman in the palm of my hand.
Hey, Marge, how you doing?
Fine, just catching up on my beading.
Hey, look, why don't you put it down for a while?
I got some news.
News?
What news?
Well, do you know Alice Hartman?
Oh, I certainly do.
As a matter of fact, I have to speak to her.
Now, she didn't tell me, but she's pregnant.
She tries to hide it, but you can't fool a mother.
I'm gonna have to ask her to leave.
The rule is no children.
Well, she had her baby, a little boy.
Now, this is gonna be a surprise for you.
- What?
- She and Gary are getting married.
See, I told you you were gonna be surprised.
But she's such a wonderful girl.
I mean, you can see what she's done for him.
- Not drinking anymore, he's working.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, you ought to see that little baby--
Mrs. Davis, what are you doing?
Mrs. Davis, you really shouldn't do that.
Jonathan.
Jonathan.
Jon--
Jonathan!
He's just like his father.
My man.
All right.
Congratulations.
-l always bet on 22.
-Twenty-two red.
-Come on, let`s go.
-Okay.
lt`s so much fun losing money for a good cause.
Your bet, Mr. Lowry.
l`ll raise you 2500.
One card.
Last card.
l`m terribly....
Sorry.
And in the savings account 1 4 dollars.
Señor Montana to see you, sir.
Luis.
Lovely seeing you again.
Miguel, get him something to drink.
What would you like, sir?
Luis, l`m afraid I have some rather disappointing news.
Things didn`t go as well for me today as I had anticipated.
Actually, it was rather novel.
It was sort of a nice change, losing.
Usually, l`m so lucky at betting.
But, as I always say, if you must lose lose to a good cause.
Stop the bullshit, Lowry.
You borrowed $40,000 from us yesterday and you lost it.
Now, that makes $640,000 you owe us.
Now, when do I see the money?
Luis, you don`t understand.
I don`t gamble because I want to.
With me, gambling is a disease.
People die from that disease, Lowry.
Do you know what I mean?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
Let me level with you, Luis.
The truth is:
l`m broke.
-ls there anything else you would like, sir?
-No, Miguel.
That will be all.
Chocolate mousse?
-A little cannoli?
-No cannoli!
All I need is a little time.
My uncle is very, very old.
When he dies, l`ll inherit all of this.
All the stocks, the bonds, the antique French knickknacks.
-Everything you see will be mine.
-Wrong, Lowry.
Most of it will be mine.
The question is, my friend:
How soon?
Soon.
Soon, soon.
He`s on his last leg. I could take you to him.
Would you like to see him?
Miguel.
Okay, Mr. Dennison, just relax.
lt`s time for your oxygen.
There we go.
-How`s he doing?
-Great.
Just great.
Thanks a lot, idiot.
So you`re feeling well, Uncle Albert?
Check the oxygen.

Excuse me.
You`ll have to disembark now.
The plane`s ready to take off.

Now, be good, now.
Buffy, be a good boy.

You listen, anything happens to my son, l`m gonna jack you up.
Ladies and gentlemen, we will be departing shortly.
Please fasten your seat belts, extinguish all smoking materials.
And make sure your seatbacks and trays are in the upright and locked position.
Help me!
-You all right?
-Sir, are you all right?
-l`m all right.
-Sure?
I don`t know about this job, man.
You know what I think?
lt`ll be like the jobs we got fired from.
What you talking about, man?
With those jobs, people didn`t give us a chance.
You see, Mr. Lowry up there see our potential.
We got to prove ourself.
We got to do right.
We got to be smart.
-Shut up, stupid.
-Man, stop.
Cool it, man.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Flight 253 for Atlanta and Dallas is now departing at gate 2 1.
All passengers holding tickets for Dallas-Fort Worth on flight 253 should present their passes at gate 2 1.
-Check out that Rolls.
-That`s def, man.
I like that.
-Nice.
-Brothers in Brooklyn would love this.
These are the new orderlies, Fritz.
Hotel shuttles are available at the front entrance of the terminal at no charge.
-Watch out.
-Yo, man, you can sit in the middle.
I wanna play the window.
-l`m sitting in the car.
-You shouldn`t be here.
If I sit in the trunk, the car might pop a wheelie.
-Come on, man.
-Step off, man.
Y`all some suckers.
That`s all right.
That`s why your mother`s a man.
-Hey, Buff.
Check this out.
-What`s up?
"Palm Beach city ordinance, section 2901 :
Shirts and shoes must be worn in Palm Beach at all times.
Violators are subject to fine, imprisonment, or both."
This is ill.
Crazy.
Under arrest?
You`re under arrest for section 2901 , jogging without the use of proper apparel.
Damn, they don`t give you much slack out here.
Hey, hey, hey, you sexy, sweet young things, you.
--corner of 1 2th and 1 6th, man threatening a woman with a baseball bat, code three....
Again, l`m terribly sorry about this.
Sergeant.
This place is heavy, man.
God, let me be on my best behavior, please.
Excuse me.
Nice.
-Damn it.
-Love this.
These can`t possibly be the new orderlies.
These are the new orderlies.
Chauncey, baby.
Did you miss me?
Here, l`d like to present Uncle Albert`s new orderlies.
Bad dog.
Bad dog.
My name is George.
I am the butler.
I work for Mr. Dennison and my staff work for me.
-What`s up, brother?
Yeah.
-What`s up, man?
We will go inside now.
This way.
No.
The servants` entrance is this way.
And this is the Dennison sitting room.
Yo, this a sitting room, man.
Check it out.
Damn, man.
This guy don`t throw away anything.
Tight squeeze.
-What`s this thing do?
-We only have one rule in this house:
Don`t touch anything.
-You got it, brother.
-Excuse me.
What does this guy do?
He`s like the super.
I love this place. l`m telling you, man.
Nice big hallways.
This place is bigger than my school.
-Oh, my God. l`m in love.
-Nice flowers.
You can smell it.
See y`all later.
Poetry in motion.
Don`t touch anything.
Anything.
This way.
Lord please let us be on our best behavior especially Markie.
Please let him keep his dick in his pants.
-l got it.
-l got it.
Oh, no.
I got it!
I know, I know. "Don`t touch anything."
You will be expected to totally dedicate yourself to your patient, Mr. Dennison.
And it is here where you will be spending most of your time.
It is the anteroom to Mr. Dennison`s bedchamber.
Now then, over here we have the medication chart with the pills, time of day, et cetera et cetera, beautifully illustrated.
Now we come to the very heart of the system:
The pill dispenser.
I want your attention, and concentrate.
Thank you.
Now then, when the music sounds you hit the iridescent medication preparation button choose the spectrum selector, but you must ignore the quantity overdrive.
-Okay.
-And then quite simply, activate the music terminator and you`re ready for the next time.
Very simple.
Straightforward.
No problems?
-No problem.
Sure.
-We got it.
Then we shall now introduce ourselves to Mr. Dennison.
This way.
Come along.
Come along.
Hello, Mr. Dennison.
Are you awake, sir?
The new boys are here.
I know how very anxious he is to meet you.
l`ll just gently wake him up.
-What`s that?
-This is his personal transport vehicle.
He looks like Yoda.
Hello, Mr. Dennison.
Mr. Dennison, sir, please wake up.
These are your new orderlies, sir.
-Hello, Mr. Dennison.
-Hello, Mr. Dennison.
l`m having a nightmare.
No, sir, you are not.
I had no idea....
Hello.
How you doing?
Mr. Dennison doesn`t even like us, man.
No, Mr. Dennison don`t like you.
What you doing, man?
What you mean, what l`m doing?
This what l`m doing.
Read this.
It says it`s a $ 1 ,000-a-plate lunch.
That`s 5 grand there.
Okay?
-Get out of here.
-That`s right.
-Come on.
Let`s get out of here.
-Why?
Did you steal something?
No, I didn`t steal nothing.
I just don`t wanna be where l`m not wanted.
You`re always where you`re not wanted.
Boys.
Yes, Mr. Dennison.
I wanna go inside.
-Right away, Mr. Dennison.
-Coming, sir.
Yes, sir, we`ll have you in your wheelchair in a minute.
-Yeah, let`s get this right.
-This looks like a new lift.
Take that, man.
Take him and hook him up.
Expert orderlies at your service, Mr. Dennison.
A hundred bucks says they kill him themselves.
-Don`t know how to work this.
-lt`s fixed.
All right, Buff.
Here we go.
-Put me down!
-Oh, no.
Oh, God.
Oh, shit.
Put me down.
Put me down.
-l can`t work it.
-What`s wrong with you, man?
Help me.
Help me.
Help me.
Turn the wheel.
To the left.
To the right.
Get off me.
Get off me!
Mom!
No.
No!
You idiot.
Put me down.
Down!
I want them replaced immediately.
-They`re inept.
-"inept"?
Uncle Albert, you`re not giving them a chance.
You bully them.
You intimidate them.
They`re sensitive young men.
You must be kidding.
Won`t you give them another chance?
Come on, be a pal.
Please.
-George.
What`s up, man?
All right.
-George. I love it.
What`s that?
Filet of raw beef and vegetables du jour.
-"Du jour"?
-Du jour.
You sure?
Taste it, Markie.
Taste it.
Bon appétit.
Out.
Yo, Buff.
I don`t got it.
Stop it, Mama.
Come on.
-What you doing?
-Stop, man.
l`m breaking out.
l`m getting out.
-Will you cut the crap, man?
-l`m getting out, man.
This place is wack, and you know it, man.
I asked for an old cheeseburger.
Old lousy cheeseburger.
All they got is filet mignon.
I can`t even sit.
Every time I sit, the chair breaks on me.
Yo, I wanna go back to east New York now, man.
You taking me?
l`m going to the bus station now!
Those new orderlies are absolutely perfect.
Fifty bucks says they`re already asleep.
-What are you bringing him for?
-We can`t leave him by hisself.
Yo, Kool, you don`t really need to leave this.
If you do, you stupid.
Def.
l`m glad we`re getting out of there.
Hey, how`d you get a car like that?
Want a ride?
Yeah.
Come on.
Get on in here.
Yeah, set your pretty self right here, baby.
All right.
-Come in here, baby.
-Who`s this?
This is my friend Cool Al over here.
He`s into drugs.
Yeah.
Come on, baby.
Get in there.
Let`s go.
Y`all ready?
Hold on tight!
Say, where you guys going?
We`re taking Kool here to the bus station.
He`s going home.
Markie, I ain`t going nowhere.
Yeah, mama!
-Where am I?
-We`re taking you out on the town.
I wanna go home.
I wanna go home now.
You don`t need to go home.
Old people need to have fun too.
-That`s right. lt`s in my ma`s book.
-l wanna get out of here.
-immediately.
-When was the last time you danced?
Before you were born.
Well, I think it`s about time you were reborn.
Get me out of here.
Stop.
What are you doing?
Get me out of here.
You wanna tango, eh?
Another one?
Look at them!
-You all right, Mr. Dennison?
-You all right, Albert?
You guys kill me.
Another night like this, and l`ll die.
You can`t die, Albert.
If you die, we`ll lose this job.
Why don`t you be quiet, man!
How do you like that, fatso?
l`ll telling you, man, you better watch yourself.
The hell is wrong with you?
-Keep it down.
-l told you to shut up.
Man, chill out.
Stop bugging.
You have ruined my plans for the evening.
Listen.
From now on I want Albert at home where he belongs where he`s safe where he`s loved.
Chill out, Winslow.
We just went to an all-night drugstore to get some special medicine.
It worked.
No!
No!
No, no!
That dog is a bigot, man.
No, he just likes dark meat.
Bad dog.
Bad dog, bad dog.
I think that`s enough excitement for one night.
Let`s all get to bed, see if we can get some rest.
Get that dog out, man.
Mr. Lowry, keep that dog away from me, man.
No one`s scared of that dog, man.
Kick that dog`s ass.
You know, Uncle Albert I think it`s terribly unfair of you to put me through all this worry.
Step off, homeboy.
Hey.
How you doing?
lt`s always a tragedy when someone so young so vibrant is taken from our midst.
But we can console ourselves by realizing how fortunate we were to have had Chauncey with us however briefly.
-Man, you can`t do nothing right, man.
-Okay, fellas let`s play some cards.
Check this out, check this out.
Separate these into piles.
This how it`s gonna be.
The red ones, right, they gonna be worth 1 00 bucks.
The green-and-orange ones gonna be 50.
The red-and-white ones gonna be 25.
The little ones there, make those 1 0 bucks, 1 0 bucks.
Okay, I raise you...
-...two reds.
-l`m out, Fats Domino.
l`m out too, big man.
Bid daddy done did it again.
Why is this door locked?
Open it at once.
Shit.
The super.
-Quick, cover it up.
-What on earth is going on in there?
l`m coming.
Be right there.
Let me get my sneakers.
l`m coming right now.
And now l`m coming.
Fix my shoe.
-My man!
-l am?
How very nice for you.
Hey, Chauncey.
Here, have a bite.
Better yet, here, take a bite.
Go ahead.
Sucker!
Hey, Carla.
What`s up?
Hey, Haile, hold on a sec.
l`m gonna let you in.
What`s up, man?
Come on back, man.
That will be $89.76.
Put it on the Dennison bill.
Be cool, man.
Thanks a lot.
Hey, Carla.
I got the brightest idea.
Why don`t me and you go up to my room and do the wild thing.
The wild thing?
-Yeah.
-No way.
Look.
Look.
On the serious tip.
-Why don`t me and you go to a movie.
-Yeah.
-You really wanna go out with me?
-Yeah.
You gotta eat this instead of that and get rid of all that blubber and tons of that fat.
Sprouts?
All right, l`ll eat it.
lt`s worth it.
-Pizza here!
-All right!
My man!
-Yeah!
-Yeah!
Take the soda while I take this here.
Don`t touch that pizza.
What`s that, man?
lt`s good for you.
Helps you get sex.
That`s bugging.
Don`t you like this?
Want some?
Want some?
Psych!
This help you get sex, brother.
l`m still hungry, man.
-Still hungry?
-Yeah.
Eat this.
Get out of here, man.
You said you were hungry.
Markie, where the pills, man?
-What pills?
-"What pills?"
The pills you left the room with, stupid!
-Who you calling stupid, man?
-You!
l`ll go downstairs and check it out.
Don`t worry.
You better.
Albert needs those pills to stay alive.
That`s right, man.
Like I don`t know.
You all right?
Oh, no.
-Yo, Buff.
-Yo.
Yo, remember when your uncle Louie was real sick and he was taking those pills to make him better?
He had one big blue pill for his heart.
That gave him indigestion.
One red pill for his indigestion.
That gave him high blood pressure.
One big horse pill for his blood, that made him fart.
He stopped taking pills and started feeling better.
Markie, where the pills?
Carla.
She threw them out.
-What?
-What she do that for, man?
-l don`t know, man.
-Oh, shit.
Albert`s gonna die, man!
I knew it, man!
I knew it!
I knew it would happen.
lt`s your fault.
-lt`s Carla`s fault.
-Your fault.
Stop beefing, man.
Everything is my fault.
Cut it out, man.
Cut it out, man.
What we gonna do?
Albert can`t live without those pills.
What about my pills, gentlemen?
-What`s going on?
-Dr.
Lewis....
He changed the prescription.
You should stay off pills till tomorrow.
Really?
I guess the doctor knows what he`s doing.
He sure does.
Will you guys please stop illing.
Somebody`s gonna get hurt.
Okay, Mr. Dennison.
See you later.
Okay.
What`s wrong, man?
Kool, check his reflexes.
l`ll check his breathing.
I can`t see anything, man.
There`s no pressure, man.
Mark, Kool.
What`s up?
Listen, doc, it`s a matter of life and death.
-Don`t tell me that.
-How is he?
Look, it`s almost 1 2.
He hasn`t woke up yet.
Damn!
The pharmacy`s out of the prescription, man.
You killed him!
Look what you did.
I told you, I didn`t do it.
Carla did it.
-Chill.
-Maybe give him some vitamins, man.
What`s all the noise in here?
There`s something wrong with Mr. Albert.
-Really?
-Yes.
He hasn`t woke up and his heart rate is low.
Pulse is weak.
Poor Albert.
I had a premonition something terrible would happen today.
-l`ll go call the hospital.
-Better tell them to send a chaplain.
I can`t, man. I can`t tell him.
-Man, we`ll get fired.
-We`ll lose this job anyway if he dies.
-You have to tell him.
-l can`t, man.
Maybe the paramedics will bring some pills.
You gotta tell him.
You gotta.
Come on, be a man, not a girl.
Go ahead.
-Chapel of the Pines funeral home?
-Mr.
Lowry!
Just a moment.
May I speak to Mr. Thorton?
Bill, this is Winslow Lowry.
-Mr.
Lowry.
-Just a moment.
l`m afraid it`s time.
He`s having a spasm!
-A spasm!
-Stop him, man!
Hurry up!
We gotta stop him, man!
-Stop him, man.
-Stop.
CPR!
CPR!
-Two, three, four.
-No!
Move, man, mouth-to-mouth!
Mouth-to-mouth!
Mouth-to-mouth!
See how you like it!
Two, three, four, five six, seven, eight!
He looks surprisingly good, considering the blows that he suffered.
But what about my uncle?
How did he get better?
He was overmedicated before.
They lucked into something when they lost his medication.
-They what?
-They lost his pills.
I heard them.
They bungled their way into a breakthrough in Albert`s treatment.
Amazing the way luck can play a part in recovery.
He`ll be back on the golf course in no time at all.
Amazing.
Do I feel great!
And I owe it all to you guys.
Now that l`m young again, l`m gonna show you boys the fun I had when I was your age.
We`re gonna go skeet shooting, we`re gonna go yachting.
We`re going on safari.
And we`ll go looking for women in remote spots around the world.
-Sound good?
-Yeah!
We`ll have a great time, the five of us.
Right, Winslow?
Right.
You know, Albert we were afraid that, since you`re better now, you know you won`t be needing us no more and might fire us.
Fire you?
l`ll never fire you guys.
You may be unorthodox but you certainly get results.
A stroke goes like this.
Okay, go ahead, Markie.
Get me off this thing.
Chill, horse!
No, stop!
Okay, horse, it`s our turn.
That`s right.
Out, good. ln.
Out, in, out.
In.
Come on. ln.
Out.
Great Jesus Palomino.
-United States Treasury note, $ 1 0,000.
-What?
Enough is enough.
lt`s time to play hardball.
No more natural causes, no more medications, no more Mr. Nice Guy.
Albert is dead tonight. lt`s gonna look like those morons did it.
Lowry lives all right.
Check this out.
Guns.
We take these back to Brooklyn, man, we run things.
Scopes.
Yo!

Hey!
Let`s get out of here before Lowry comes.
All fixed.
You may have to get that computer repaired.
-Thank you.
-Anytime.
Luis Montana, please.
Luis?
Lowry.
l-- l can-
- Luis, I can have your money for you tomorrow.
No, no, no. I have a plan, but I need your help.
What`s going on next door?
What`s that, man?
Damn!
God bless them, God bless them.
-Have you given the staff tomorrow off?
-Of course.
-There won`t be a soul in sight...
-Good.
...for the rest of the night.
You guys are late.
Not that late.
What do you think, man?
Too skinny.
Too skinny.
Too damn skinny.
You can see their bones and shit.
They look like bicycles.
-l want a woman who looks like a Cadillac.
-l know what you mean.
Oh, man, look at those jugs.
l`m telling you.
Look at that butt, man.
Like a pancake.
Hello, police?
Help, there`s peeping Toms!
-Let`s go, man.
Let`s get out of here.
-My head!
My head!
Damn peeping Toms.
This is the police!
Come out and give yourselves up!
Oh, shit.
Cops are shooting at us, man!
For looking at some ugly girls!
This place is stupid crazy. l`m getting out of here.
Man, oh, man.
Damn!
lt`s locked!
Harry, where are you?
-Come on, man, get up!
-Let`s get out of here!
Hang on. l`m on my way.
Let`s get out of here.

Yo, man!

You`re blowing everything!
-We gotta hide!
We gotta hide!
-Not here, you ain`t.
Get up, man!

-Get off me!
-Police is after us!
-Why, what`d you do?
-Look at naked girls.
-What?
-Naked girls.
Break it up, man.
We gotta hide.
Open up.
Open up!
I hate you guys, man!
Move out of the way!
-You can`t fit under there!
-Open this door now!
Mr. Officer, sir, I don`t know them.
They broke in on me and my girl.
I got nothing to do with it.
Mr. Dennison, man, tell them we didn`t do nothing, man.
Don`t let them take us away.
Quit pushing me, man.
Sir.
We found the bullet hole.
It was in Mr. Dennison`s room.
Looks like someone shot at him.
I don`t understand this, detective.
Someone tried to kill you.
Could have been them.
That`s impossible.
My orderlies are very nice boys.
Did you actually see who took a shot at you?
-No.
-So you can`t say it wasn`t the orderlies.
-Well, no. I can`t.
-lf l may suggest something, sergeant.
I didn`t want to say but l`ve noticed several items missing from the house.
Are you suggesting--?
-Let`s have a look in their rooms.
-Right this way, please.
-l don`t know what`s going on.
-l don`t either.
-Open them up.
-What do they think they`re gonna find?
They`re good boys.
They don`t do wrong.
That`s one of my trophies from the den.
Well, well.
Get those jerks down to the station.
But, Mr. Dennison, man!
I can`t go to jail.
My mother`s gonna kill me!
Believe me, I don`t think the boys could have had anything to do with this.
-l don`t know, Carla.
-Luis?
Lowry.
-l didn`t hear him come in.
-I can have the money tomorrow.
No, no, no.
I have a plan.
I need your help.
If you help me kill Albert, I can make it look like the orderlies did it.
-Luis, I assure you....
-Did you hear that?
That no-good, two-timing snake.
Son of a bitch.
-What...?
-l`m gonna take this to the police.
Carla, help Albert downstairs.
l`m gonna go ahead and get the car.
Oh, no.
Oh, Markie!
Hello, Uncle Albert.
-No!
-Save the talk.
Let`s tie them up.
Yes.
Something is weird, man.
Yeah.
Somebody put that gun in our luggage.
Someone who wanna wax Albert.
Who?
I don`t know.
Maybe the super did it.
No. I think it`s Miguel.
What would Miguel get out of killing Albert?
Lowry get all his money.
Yeah, you`re right.
Must be Lowry.
That snake.
Yeah.
He set us up from the beginning.
We don`t stand a chance.
The cops`ll never believe us.
l`m tired of waiting.
I want a confession and I want it now.
-Confess!
-All right, it`s like this.
-Lowry put the gun in our luggage.
-Exactly.
Shut up!
Now, you boys had better start talking sense or l`m gonna use a Florida lie detector.
What`s a Florida lie detector?
A Florida lie detector is a 300-pound white man with a baseball bat.
-Goddamn!
What`s he gonna do?
-What`s that for?
Hey, what`s that for?
You gonna demolish us?
What y`all doing?
Can somebody answer me?
Come on!
Get him up here!
I saw you jogging.
You can move faster than that.
-What is he saying?
-Shut up.
-Come on!
Let`s go!
-Get him in there!
-Wait`ll I get loose.
-What?
-Gonna fly that head.
-Shut him up!
My pleasure.
l`ll just give them an extra-fat dose of the knockout drug.
Get him over here.
All right, Albert.
-Open that safe!
-No!
Uncle Albert, please.
No!
For me?
You son of a bitch!
Get him over there and tie him up.
Relax.
First, we`ll blow open the door to the safe so we can get the money out.
Then, we`ll rig a second big explosion to take care of these three.
Yo, look, Mr. Officer-Sergeant, sir.
I want to point out an unfair situation.
Shut your fat, ugly face!
These guys gonna kick our asses, man.
We gonna be hurt, but Albert gonna be dead!
Now, watch this.
-That`s def.
-Watch this Brooklyn boy go to work.
Get under there.
What happened?
I don`t know.
The brakes?
What the hell`s the matter with you?
You crazy?
Oh, no.
-My neck is just killing me.
-l don`t know how this happened.
You gotta be from Brooklyn to do this.
l`m telling you, you know what l`m saying?
Yeah.
Yeah, boy.

Hey!
That`s our car!
-Steer this thing right!
-We got the right of way, man.
Yo!

-We def, man.
-Real def.
Give me this hanger.
Let`s get out of here.
Word.
Check me out.
Check me out.
-Please, Miguel, l`ll do it. l`ll do it.
-Careful.
Careful.
Scatter some around so it looks like it went up in the explosion.
No.
Not too much.
We`ll get the wheelbarrow, put the rest in the van.
The van?
What do you mean?
The money can`t be here when the police get here, now, can it?
He`s got a point.
But I have to be here for the alibi.
You`ll just have to trust me, won`t you?
Oh, sure. I trust you.
Yo, Kool...
-...that`s a hit, man.
-Let`s go.
-You!
Stop this car!
-Hey, you deaf?
Stop this car.
Right here.
-Let me check your "speedanometer."
-Speedometer, man.
I was only going 25.
Our radar clocked you doing 40.
Now, get out the car. I ain`t got time for your crap.
-Come on.
-Hey, hey.
Get on the ground, man.
Get on the ground.
Come on, man, let`s go.
Facedown!
l`ll check your "speedronometer."
-Speedometer, man.
Let`s get out of here.
-Speedometer.
What you looking at?
Get on the ground.
We`ll be right back.
Wait right here.
Don`t drop me, please.
Don`t drop me, man.
Hurry up.
Let`s go.
We ain`t got all day!
Come on, fat man, get with it!

Gonna catch a heart attack.
Damn!
All those guys got guns.
-Now we`re going to have some fun.
-Oh, good.
Now we got guns too.
Too slow.
That`ll work.
Now we need bullets.
Bingo.
-ls that ready?
-lt`s ready.
-Run it through the tunnel.
-Leave it to me.
Quick.
Ready?
Let`s get busy now.
I got your back.
Yo, don`t point that gun at me, man!
What the hell is that?
You crazy, man!
You are sick, man.
I swear to God.
Take this shit off, man.
You is one sick dude, man.
Crazy. I don`t believe you.
-You could have killed us!
-l was trigger-happy.
How we gonna deal with these kids?
These guys are unbelievable.
l`ll do it.
Are you crazy?
No more shooting.
No more guns.
No more guns.
Put away the guns.
This has got to be subtle.
We`ll blow them up with the others.
-l like that.
-You stay here, capture them.
-l`ll go back and keep an eye on them.
-Be careful.
You take the big one, l`ll take the other.
Which one`s the big one?
Get off my friend, man.
Kool, l`m coming!
l`m coming!
What are you doing in there?
You can`t fit in there.
Come on.
All right!
Some cookies!
I feel better already!
Damn, man!
Feel like glue!
Man, look at this, man.
This stuff stick to anything.
Let`s go.
-Come on, hurry up!

-Man?

Oh, man!
Miguel?
Miguel!

Somebody!
Help!
That`s Albert, man!
That`s Albert!
We gotta help him!
Faster!
Faster!
Go, Kool.
Go, man, go!
Go, man!
Go, man!
Move it!
Miguel, move it!
Wait.
Stop!
Idiot, stop!
-Light the fuse!
-All right.
Okay.
-Help!
-Help!
-What`s that, man?
-Let`s go!
Let`s go!
Faster!
Faster!
Thirty seconds and kapooey!
Come on!
Come on!
Help!
Cannonball!
Hey, how you doing?
You guys are a miracle.
Get us out of here quick.
Got here in no time.
lt`s starting up again!
-That`s better.
-Come on!
Let`s get out of here!
Hurry!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Over here!
All right!
-l`ll meet you back at the hotel.
-Luis, it`s been a pleasure.
l`ll see you back at the hotel.
Real fast.
Miguel, one last touch of genius.
I was protecting Uncle Albert, I got shot in the process.
l`ll be a hero.
-Shoot me.
-No, allow me.
-No, no, no, I want to do it.
-No. l`ll do it.
-l want him to do it.
-You want it done right, don`t you?
-Turn around.
-Okay, okay.
Okay, but not with that.
Use the little gun.
Yes-
- Yes, please.
Please.
As you wish.
Bend over.
Just a flesh wound.
Just-
- Just graze me.
Don`t worry.
You won`t feel a thing.
Luis Montana served seven years and was released.
My rotten nephew also served seven years and was released.
Wait.
Wait. I have a plan!
lt`s flawless!
What plan?
They´re now both serving an additional 20.
Kool became a lifeguard.
He´s currently training to swim the English Channel.
Buffy went to medical school and is now practicing heart surgery at a hospital in Beverly Hills.
Markie never returned to school, but he has become a sex therapist in private practice.
Somebody might come in.
I married Niko.
We now have four children and one on the way.
Though the boys have gone on to greater things, we still get together.
Every year, we plan to go on a safari.
Hey, The Beach Boys!
Check it out!
Get out of there!
Somehow, we just never make it.
Okay, Buffy, hit it!
(english)
April the thirteenth.
It supposedly was the unluckiest day of the year.
And it had to happen on that day, of all days.
Bloodshed!
Bloodshed!
Well...
Kohei Yasuda, an apprentice officer, suddenly went wild and attacked the magistrate, Kenmotsu Nagao.
Nagao had taken fifty in gold from Yasuda under the table in exchange for promoting him to detective.
But he broke the deal.
So, Yasuda got mad and went on the warpath.
I shouldn't say this, but Nagao's the one to blame.
The whole thing was just ridiculous.
And we're the ones who suffered.
It happened at lunchtime, a food and tea were all over the place.
What a mess!
In these times, life is even dear to us samurai.
Nobody wants to die for some crumb.
All we could do was run around.
But the worst was Tanaka, the inspector.
Get out of my way, Tanaka!
O-Open the door!
Open, open the door!
I'm in here!
I'm in here, you heard me!
You idiot!
Oh no!
Help!
Run!
You bastard!
No!
Die!
Wait!
Die!
No violence!
Open it!
Please!
Open up, it's me!
The magistrate!
M-May I open it, sir?
Stupid, the killer's in there!
Wait a little longer!
We'll help you out!
Hang on until then!
Be patient and wait!
W-Wait, Kohei!
I apologize!
You'll get your money and promotion, I promise!
Too late!
Step aside!
Aside!
You saw?
You saw?
I almost got killed, didn't I?
It was a great relief to be alive.
But I was wrong.
Something much worse was waiting to happen much worse.
The verdict... lt's unforgivable, Mondo Nakamura, acting cowardly during the crisis.
You shall suffer a reduction in pay to half for the next six months.
You shall be rebuked.
Sir, that's too much!
What?
Why must only I be punished?
What about the others who locked us up and didn't do anything?
Silence, Nakamura!
Don't talk back!
Being rebuked I could take.
But I can't survive that long on only half-pay...
Enough!
Case closed!
What is with your attitude, you idiot!
I know how you feel, but it's the Shogun's judgment.
You just accept it!
Accept it?
They tricked me.
Damn it!
What's all this?
What day do you think it is, dear?
The new magistrate's coming, it's an important day.
You're being penalized now.
Be the first to welcome him, it's a good chance to win his favor.
It's not that easy...
Don't argue, dear.
Neighbor Murata left an hour ago.
I guess he's smarter than my son-in-law.
All right.
You want me to leave early with my half-pay, whatever makes you happy.
Ritsu.
Where's my breakfast?
You get no breakfast.
What?
We decided that the day the new magistrate arrives we set our minds, we won't eat breakfast till you draw full pay again.
Please, go, now!
Lord Ukyonosuke Okuda, the new south magistrate, has arrived!
What a young magistrate!
He's a pet of Prime Minister Sakai.
I hear he used to be a page, look at his clothes!
Think he'll make it as a magistrate?
The food and wine are from the new magistrate.
Appreciate it.
Yes sir.
What a luxurious food!
Very expensive.
Young one tries to show off?
What?
What is it?
It's a gold coin!
A gold coin?
It's a gold coin!
I got one too!
In the soup!
is it real?
Real gold coin?
It's hot!
H-Hot!
Excuse me...
He's young but so thoughtful.
Anyway, let's wait for his toast.
All this fuss over one gold coin?
The magistrate's going to the castle.
You men stay and enjoy yourselves.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
You, what's your name?
Mondo Nakamura, sir.
So...
You're the one.
I've heard of you.
Huh?
Then I shall ask you now.
If something happens to me, don't forsake me.
Let's enjoy the dinner.
Oh yeah.
Let's go to that store.
This is a beautiful doll.
Wow, it's got a pretty face.
You guys ready?
The tragedy of poor Okiku.
She got a hairy corncob shoved deep inside her.
So poor Okiku drowned herself.
Ouch!
Hey, Nakamura!
Who are you singing about?
Better not be about Okiku, you should be praying for her soul.
What?
It wasn't an ordinary corncob, but the Shogun's.
She was humiliated and killed herself.
She had guts.
Try to act like her, okay?
Yes sir.
He's in a bad mood today.
I wonder what happened.
Who cares?
Well...
The hairy corncob sank deep...
Get that.
Yes.
He said, "don't forsake me"?
What a sense of humor!
Then what happened?
Nothing happened.
I felt rotten, so I came here to drink.
Give food to the paupers or something, it's on me.
Don't be ridiculous, giving away your money?
Can you afford it?
I know you're on half-pay.
Don't remind me, you're spoiling my sake.
It's true.
So...
Keep it for yourself.
Any news from your man?
No.
He went to look for a job two years ago and never came back.
You still call him your man?
Maybe you're right.
Why not flirt with me?
No.
Why not?
I don't want to flirt.
I want you to love me.
I'm serious.
You're lying.
Your face says...
You can't divorce your wife.
She'll kill you.
It's silly to be a man and a woman.
You think so?
They talk about what's flirting and what's love.
is that all they can do?
Oh my!
The food's burning!
Hey...
Sugie came home.
Sugie?
You know, that young samurai.
He went for a job interview.
I wonder how it went.
Tinkerer.
Yes?
I haven't seen you before, are you new around here?
Yes, today is my first day here.
May I help you?
Well...
Lend me your anvil and hammer.
I'll do it myself, it won't take a minute.
Why did you do that, Sugie?
Well... I want to forget that I'm a samurai.
That's why.
But what...
What happened to the job you mentioned?
I didn't get it.
This sword was a family treasure.
I tried to sell it to get money for someone who helped me.
Then I found out it's a fake.
But...
That made me decide to work as an umbrella maker.
And this is more useful for carving.
I feel sorry for Sugie.
Did he love that girl?
He'd planned to propose to her after he got the job.
But now he can't.
Get out our way!
Who are they?
Shogun's retainers, reckless samurai!
What is this?
It's a dead end.
What the hell, who brought us to this slum?
Kyuma!
Hey, what are you thinking bringing us to a dump like this?
I, Kyuma Kagazume will demonstrate my Megaki style leaping technique!
Next!
You, Koyata, do it!
Why not?
Here I go!
I'll go next, watch me!
Hold it!
Though poor, we have the right to live here.
There're old people and children too.
What if you injure someone?
Stop it!
What's that?
Hey, old man!
You, a samurai in some slum, dare criticize us, the Shogun's retainers?
You may be the Shogun's retainers, but you're still foolish!
What's that?
Step aside!
Look what you did!
Watch out!
No!
Father!
Father!
You all right?
Father!
You okay?
You all right?
Father!
What's wrong?
His neck is broken, ribs too.
What?
Murderer!
Murderer!
Murderer, murderer!
Get lost!
Murderer!
Give him back his life!
Give him back his life!
We didn't kill him.
The horse did.
The horse killed him, don't blame us.
Let's go.
W-W-Wait.
Stop!
Listen to me!
I know how you feel but don't make it worse.
Hey... lt's something you don't understand.
Huh?
Anybody know what happened to the horse?
It's over there!
This is... lt made the horse run.
But who did it, and why?
Nakamura.
Yes sir.
Your report states it wasn't just an accident.
You suspect treachery and wish to proceed with an investigation.
Yes.
I object.
Huh?
Your theory is absurd.
It's unfounded, I have to reject it.
Excuse me, but I have proof.
As I stated in there... I found the cross-shaped dagger in the horse's leg.
And what dagger are you talking about?
I submitted it with the report, sir.
I never received any such thing.
Huh?
I can't believe it.
I absolutely...
Did either of you receive it?
Huh?
N-No, sir, I didn't.
Neither did I.
What are you talking about?
I handed it to you.
I'm sorry, sir.
I was wrong.
I'm certain it was just an accident.
Good.
That's better.
May I ask you one thing?
What will happen to the Shogun's retainers?
I was informed that they're under household arrest.
No further punishment is required.
Case closed!
is Kyuzo here?
Yes, sir.
You left it at the scene.
It's not like you.
I'm sorry, sir.
That Mondo Nakamura is snooping around.
I don't think he's that sharp, but be careful.
Yes sir.
Oyumi, the soil...
Here you go.
I wonder who he was.
Huh?
The other guy who saved the kid.
What are you talking about?
You mean the old samurai wasn't the only one?
No.
I'm sure I saw him.
But did you see him?
I don't think so.
Me either.
Maybe you're mistaken...
You think so?
Why don't you ask the kid?
He doesn't live around here.
What?
Maybe he was just playing or just passing through, I'd never seen him before.
So the old samurai had to die trying to save a total stranger?
Boss, we're all here.
Please come out.
Yes.
Thanks for coming at this late hour.
I'll just get to the point.
We have three targets.
First...
Chikara Jinbo, the wild samurai leader.
Second...
Shinpachi Taro, his lieutenant.
Third...
Kyuma Kazazume, one of the gang.
They're the ones who caused the old samurai's death 10 days ago.
And about the fee... I've received three in gold up front.
I'm supposed to have three more later.
Total of six in gold.
What?
Only six in gold for three targets?
If it's Shogun's retainers, ten per head is even cheap.
Only six for three targets.
You've got to be kidding me.
Please don't go!
I know it's not enough, I know it's not but it's all I could raise.
Please!
Please!
Please, avenge my father!
My father...
Go inside, don't worry.
I'll take care of this.
She's from a common family.
Imagine...
How she slaved to raise even three.
Not only that...
What she must do to raise rest of the balance.
Will any of you be kind enough to accept?
Let's go, officer.
You guys go.
I'll stay.
You'll stay?
You'll accept so little?
Edo avengers, some people!
You call six in gold "little"?
What?
Hey, traveler.
What did you just say?
Sorry if I provoked you.
It's just the howling of a hungry stray dog.
Boss.
Let me take the three targets.
I'll be glad to do it.
Wait a minute.
Boss.
I'll accept too.
Officer!
I have a reason, just let me.
Okay...
Then you two can decide how to handle it.
You'll talk and split the targets or work every man for himself.
You'll be paid as you get the targets.
We're strangers.
So we'll work separately.
Just like "capture the flag."
That sounds good.
I'll get moving right now.
Yeah!
Yeah!
If you're going to fall in love you should do it like this.
Give him a hug and tease him a little.
Give him a kiss and tease him a little more.
But what you really should do is this and that and everything!
Everything!
He's got a tiny one!
Hear that?
Murderer?
What of it?
Bring it on!
I'll kill you all!
Who's next?
Kyuma, you all right?
Shut up!
I'm a murderer!
Are you listening to me?
All right, all right.
Hey, take him to bed.
What's wrong with you?
Let's sing!
...you should is this and that and everything!
Everything!
Coming through.
It's down the hall.
What do you want?
Well, I brought a gift from our master like we promised.
Let's see.
Thanks.
By the way, about the other day...
Was that what you wanted?
We didn't mean to kill the old samurai.
What did the magistrate say?
Well...
He might ask you to pull another job pretty soon.
Sounds interesting.
Fine.
Tell him we accept.
Another job...
What's going on?
Shh...
Who are you?
Dad!
Somebody help!
What happened?
What's going on?
You idiot, get out of my way!
It was a Shogun's retainer.
He was decapitated and lying in a pool of blood.
How disgraceful!
It's dishonor to the Shogun.
They should behave themselves.
What are they thinking?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
How long do we have to wait?
Who needs you?
We'll avenge Kyuma.
Let's go.
Yeah!
Out of my way!
You're lucky.
If it were a bit more serious you'd lose your job as officer and avenger.
Anyway, you failed to kill and got hurt.
What a smart samurai!
Leave me alone.
Don't be like that.
We're all worried about you.
It's not worth getting hurt with that low fee.
Hey, officer.
They're kids but they're still samurai.
And they're wild and hot-headed too!
You might not be alive next time.
I heard that the new magistrate is in on this.
I don't think you should be doing this alone.
Actually... I want to ask you guys a favor.
What favor?
About the new magistrate...
There is something fishy about him.
I want you to find out anything about him, will you?
Sure, by the way...
Have you changed your taste in women?
Eh?
Why?
She's been waiting outside.
What?
That brat!
What do you want?
Huh?
You know that I'm an officer, don't you?
Why are you following me?
l-l lost sight of my dad.
Don't lie to me.
What does your dad have to do with me?
Because you're both avengers!
You're after the same targets!
Keep it down!
That's why I thought if I followed you, I could meet him.
is that so?
I want to talk to him too.
Follow me.
Why are you afraid?
He's your brother, isn't he?
But... lf Dad is here too he'll scold me.
Why would he do that?
I don't know.
Weird family.
Thanks.
But you were careless.
Sis!
Dad, please let me stay with you.
I'll go crazy without you and Choji.
I can't live away from you.
Dad, I'm begging you!
I know I'm not that smart but you can tell me what to do.
I'll change as you like.
I'll do whatever you say!
So, please Dad!
What brings you here?
I...
Not you.
I'm asking the officer.
I'll wait until you guys finish your family stuff.
I'm finished now.
Dad!
Don't "Dad" me.
I'm not your father.
Dad!
Leave!
What do you want?
I heard about an odd avenger using his kids.
So you're the one, Bunshichi.
Just answer the question.
You may be an oddball but last night you went too far.
Go away if you're meaning your wound.
Just listen.
We're both avengers.
We kill for money.
No point in killing other avengers.
Let's make up and share the targets.
Everybody is happy and peaceful.
What are you talking about?
You were the one who wanted to work separately.
I know, but...
No, I'm not interested.
I know but...
No, I'm not interested.
Listen.
I'll kill anything gets in my way.
That's how I work.
Get lost!
Hey!
Jerk!
I told you to leave!
Go, go, go!
No!
Go, go, go!
Leave!
Dad, please, Dad!
Leave!
Dad!
Get lost!
You bastard!
Stupid Dad!
Stupid...
Damn you!
Oh well, that's why I don't want kids.
Hey, you, come inside.
Drop in.
Hey, you there with the bandana!
How about you?
Come on.
No thanks.
Come on.
Hey handsome.
Why not come inside?
Jerk!
Please.
Please, come in.
Please.
Oh, I beg you.
Please drop in...
What a gloomy voice!
Hey, you, come here!
I haven't seen you in a while!
Hey, you, come here!
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go!
You, come here!
I told you!
You have to look more cheerful to get men, you idiot!
I'm sorry.
Sorry isn't going to do!
I don't care if your father was a samurai.
But you have to follow my rules now!
Work hard or else, got it?
Yes, ma'am.
Then go get a sucker, hurry!
Hey, won't you please come in?
Eh?
Hey, won't you please come in?
Hey, won't you please come in?
Nah...
Hey, won't you please come in?
Please sir, please!
No thanks!
Please sir, please!
Please sir, please!
Hey you!
Please sir, please!
This is my spot.
Scram!
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Hey.
What's the matter?
Hey...
Please come in.
You drunk?
I sure am.
I'm drinking the best stuff I have.
That's great.
By the way...
Any messages for me?
No...
Okay.
Thanks.
Well then let me drink your best stuff, too.
No.
Why be difficult?
Why did you try to court me?
Huh?
You were flirting with me.
Sometimes women want men to be serious even if they know the men are just flirting.
That's how we are.
You're mean, Nakamura.
What's wrong?
What happened?
Tell me.
Will you?
You'll feel better.
A friend of mine was going to Osaka so I asked him to take my letter.
To your man?
Yes.
But he was gone.
Gone?
He quit his job six months ago.
No one knows where he is now.
Would you believe it?
I couldn't help it... I needed a drink.
Maybe this is how it should be.
I feel a little better.
As if a burden were removed.
Take me somewhere.
Anywhere...
For a few days...
The mountains, the sea, anywhere.
Will you take me?
Please.
Sure, Ofuku.
I have to take care of something first.
But I'll take you somewhere.
The shining sea might be good for you.
How about some island?
Well, I've got to go now.
I'm serious.
I promise.
Don't do anything stupid.
Sorry to keep you.
Anything new?
That young magistrate was promoted by Prime Minister Sakai.
Sakai brought him to the castle as a page.
Since then he's moved up amazingly fast.
And finally he became a magistrate.
But no one knows his history.
Was he a temple page?
Yeah, but I don't know which temple.
Some say he's a nobleman's son from Kyoto.
But others say he once was a prostitute.
A male prostitute?
Officer.
What sort of business are you into?
If that fishy guy is in on this, I don't want any part of it.
If something happens to you they're going find out about us, too.
I know.
A prostitute, huh?
Sounds likely.
Hey.
Officer.
Judging from what you told me, he must be Kyonosuke.
The age and the looks match too.
I've been in this business for a long time, but... I don't think I've ever seen a guy as beautiful as him.
He had such soft and fair skin, damn it!
Officer.
To be honest, I'm still in love with him.
How long did he work here?
Well...
For a few years.
He was a fortunate boy.
With that face...
He became a Kabuki actor after Haginosuke ended up like that.
Hey hey, hold on.
...after Haginosuke ended up like that.
Hey hey, hold on.
Who is Haginosuke?
His rival.
One of them was supposed to be an actor but he committed a double suicide with a customer.
Oh?
Just before his big break?
Exactly sir.
It wasn't even somebody he was seeing...
He and his guest poisoned themselves the first night they met.
It was very strange.
Poisoned themselves?
Well, anyway because he died, Kyonosuke could leave this place.
I remember Kyonosuke.
He was a ham, but he looked beautiful on the stage.
Unlike this shack, it was a real theater downtown.
A real fancy one.
I still remember.
When Kyonosuke posed like this, the audience went wild!
It was certainly amazing.
Then, Enkoin Temple offered him a job as page.
Enkoin, the temple?
Yup.
A high-class temple where ladies-in-waiting go.
We were surprised when we heard that they'd invited him in there.
How did it happen?
I don't know well.
But I heard it was arranged by Lord Sakai, the temple magistrate then.
You mean the Prime Minister Sakai?
Yes.
But there was one problem.
The troupe leader refused to release Kyonosuke.
That's understandable.
He liked him very much.
But he gave in after all?
No choice, he died.
Died?
Was he poisoned?
I heard he was killed by a robber.
But no one was prosecuted so I don't know who did it.
Anyway...
Kyonosuke moved into the temple.
Rumor has it he became the Shogun's page later on.
The troupe leader's death was timely.
Over there.
Yes sir.
Thanks.
Here's a tip for you.
Thank you very much.
Big party tonight, eh?
For whom?
For Lady Matsuo, from the Shogunate.
is that so?
Then, whose palanquin is that?
It belongs to Prime Minister Sakai, and his servants are here too.
is he here, too?
Yes.
They came to pray for the Shogun's recovery.
Oh?
Thank you.
The Shogun's recovery?
is he ill?
I hadn't heard about it...
Sorry I'm late.
Hurry!
Let me take his pulse.
Okiku...
Okiku...
Be brave, Shogun!
Okiku...
Pour for him.
Yes.
Come to think of it, it was a while ago...
The Shogun was well when he had this made.
He'd come here almost every day to entertain himself.
I heard that he enjoyed it especially with Okiku.
Yes.
Take a gook look!
In no way am I inferior to young pages!
That's what he used to say.
He would go into that room.
There he laid his hands on Okiku, the maidservant.
Hey, hey, hey.
No, please!
Please stop!
Please stop!
Please...
Please don't do this!
Please don't...
Come on.
Anyway I'm surprised you knew about it.
The Shogun had recurring nightmares saying "Okiku, Okiku forgive me!" in his sleep.
No one really figured out that it was about that maidservant, but...
How could you know?
We'll talk about it some other day.
Meanwhile...
Let's enjoy the climax.
Women's pleasure lasts till they turn into ashes.
How fortunate they are!
Prayers won't work.
To save the Shogun from his nightmares to remove the thorn, Okiku, from his mind your plan will be the best.
But he's very old.
We must hurry.
Yes.
I understand, sir.
Okiku rests in peace at the age of 19.
The tragedy of poor Okiku...
So, it wasn't just a song.
But what's the connection to the tenement houses in the village?
Him, why is he here?
Who's there?
Come out!
Or shall I come to you?
Mondo Nakamura.
I heard you were a lazy officer.
But I guess you're a hard worker.
Remember this...
Whatever you do, my position will not be affected.
Let me know when you change your mind and decide to work for me.
Since you're working hard, I can even have you promoted.
He's onto us now.
What'll we do?
We'll do it.
Have we a choice?
Shinpachi, what's keeping you?
Come on!
Hey, don't leave me alone.
Wait!
A top's spinning...
Ouch...
A top's spinning...
Dad!
Shinpachi!
Hey, what happened?
Who's there?
Wait!
Wait!
Run!
Wait!
Wait!
Hey, you, stop!
Hey, wait!
Shinpachi!
Shinpachi!
Stop there!
Wait!
Which way did he go?
Right or left?
Let's split!
Okay, I'll go this way.
We have to avenge Shinpachi, don't miss him!
Okay, put him down.
Shinpachi, Shinpachi, Shinpachi!
Damn!
Look!
What is it?
Are you blind?
This thickness and this radiance... lt's not a normal knife.
It's made from a sword.
A sword?
A sword that belonged to a samurai.
Find out who did it.
Shinpachi, don't worry.
I'll avenge your death.
Me too.
I promise, Shinpachi!
Shinpachi!
Shinpachi!
Shinpachi!
It's soaking.
We must take it apart and wash it.
But it's a brand new kimono.
A kimono's life depends on who wears it.
Poor kimono!
What were you doing to get so wet?
Working.
I know you were working, I'm asking what kind of work it was.
Watching a dangerous criminal.
With whom?
Nobody.
What happened to the criminal?
He died.
He died?
He was murdered.
Oh, you actually did such manly work?
Mother, Mother!
My husband was alone and... I heard.
Use an umbrella next time you watch out murders.
What's that?
Maybe it's the dead man's friend here to get you.
Son-in-Law!
Take it easy.
Who is it?
Be careful, my dear.
You're...
My dad...
What?
Please help my dad.
Hey!
Who's the kid?
He's sick.
Sick?
Yes.
He has a fever, bring him in!
Yes.
No.
Yes.
Mother!
I want to make sure one thing first.
Son-in-Law, don't tell me he's your son.
Oh please, he has a father.
Are you sure?
Oh please, he has a father.
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
I'm serious!
I'm serious!
Fine, Ritsu, boil water.
Take him inside, son-in-law.
Don't hold him that way.
Keep his head higher.
How clumsy, hurry!
Dad, be brave!
Don't die, Dad!
Your brother asked me to come.
What happened?
I don't know.
When I got here, he'd been already injured.
I found this in his shoulder.
It's poisoned.
Dirty trick!
He came to.
You all right, Dad, be brave!
Dad!
It's me, Dad.
Why are you here?
Dad...
Leave...
But...
Get out!
Choji.
Who are you?
Relax, will you?
It's me.
It's you.
I'm keeping your kid.
Why do I have to take care of your kid?
Poor kid, he was drenched.
Why do you have to use your kids for killing?
I don't understand.
He's your own son, for god's sake.
No, he isn't.
I bought these two kids.
Bought them?
Yeah, so what?
If I hadn't, neither of them would have lived.
Their poor parents would've killed them.
Even so, they are still kids... I'm just teaching them how to live.
I was also bought the moment I was born.
My foster father was an avenger, that's how it was.
I learned how to crush a man's face with my top.
The smell of blood, rolling human heads...
Yeah, I got used to such things.
It's like a merchant's son who learns accounting.
What?
Why so quiet, well, that's what happened.
If you're a real avenger don't look so glum.
Thanks for Choji.
You can leave now.
What now?
Meaning?
I guess she didn't mind the poison.
What do you mean?
She sucked it out.
You'll recover soon.
Maybe you bought her, but you should be nice to her.
She's no longer a kid.
She's a woman.
It happened about a month ago.
Dad.
What?
We did it a good job, didn't we?
Yeah.
You said I couldn't do it, but I did it, didn't I?
Sure.
You surprised me.
I'm glad to hear.
Saucy!
Shut up!
What's wrong?
We have to get up early tomorrow.
Omitsu.
What's the matter?
I've stayed away from her since.
I can use kids, but not a woman.
Women are too soft for this life-or-death racket.
I didn't know...
Sorry I made you talk.
Lousy work we have, huh?
Don't worry about your kid.
Oh, you're awake?
Your fever's down.
Good.
Your dad will be fine in a few days.
But don't tell anyone about our secret work.
Especially not my wife and mother-in-law.
Understand?
Good.
It's time for breakfast.
Ritsu.
That child looks that he's good enough to be a samurai's son.
Exactly, Mother.
I don't want to say this but he looks better than my son-in-law.
I wish we could adopt him as our successor.
Mother?
You get a divorce from your husband right away.
Then we can have another chance in life.
But that's going too far.
Ritsu, you can't stay young forever.
You must remarry while you can.
Now is the time to make up your mind.
Mother.
Actually I've been thinking about the same thing.
Isn't it too much, you two?
My dear.
Oh, son-in-Law.
My dear.
Don't forget, I'm a man, too.
There are women who'll love me.
Who would want to stay here?
Thanks a lot, good-bye!
Where are you going?
Don't worry.
Where are you going?
He'll come back.
Think so?
Of course, he always does.
Think so?
Of course, he always does.
I really wish he were dead!
Nakamura!
Oh, what happened?
I want to talk to you about my man, he's coming back!
What?
He wrote to me!
He opened a shop somewhere and he's coming to pick me up.
Would you believe it?
After making me worry so much, he's so selfish.
Don't you think so?
What'll I do?
What do you mean?
I'm scared.
Scared?
is it all right that only I'll be happy?
I'm scared.
The gods may punish me.
Nonsense!
No gods will punish you.
Pray with me!
We can't go on a trip now.
Sorry.
Thank you.
I'll never forget you.
It's him that time.
Mr. Tinker!
You're the one who saved that child.
When the horse went wild, you and Hirano saved the kid.
I don't think so.
You're mistaken.
You don't need to hide it.
Unfortunately, Hirano broke his neck and died.
I've been wondering who the other man was.
I'm glad to find out.
I'll tell everyone about you, they'll give you more work.
You deserve it.
You're a hero.
Stay here.
Shogun's retainers!
They're here again!
Run for it!
They're here again!
What?
What do you want?
Get lost, murderer!
Get lost!
Whose dagger is this?
Mine.
It's been missing.
So, it's you!
If it's yours, you're the one who killed Shinpachi!
What?
Killed him?
You killed the old samurai, Hirano!
Yeah!
What, are you challenging us?
Sounds like fun.
We came to fight.
Let's do it.
Charge!
Dear!
What are you doing?
No one here?
I wonder what's going on.
Mr. Nakamura, what are you doing here?
Why do you care?
Can' t l sip tea?
It's no time for tea!
The Shogun's retainers again.
There're a lot of people injured and dead, all the officers went to the village.
Really?
Nakamura!
You're late.
Mr. Nakamura!
Ofuku!
Ofuku!
It's me, Nakamura, do you recognize me?
Your luck is returning.
Don't die.
I told you, the gods will punish me.
Ofuku!
Let me go!
Let go of me!
Give it up!
Listen, we only avenged our friends' deaths.
Why must we die?
Stop!
Fools!
Let me speak.
Magistrate Okuda started all this!
Kill them!
Out of my way!
What are you doing?
Damn it!
Why do we have to be evicted?
What did we do wrong?
Kick them out!
Hey, get moving!
Hurry!
Shut up!
Snap it up!
Walk!
Hurry, keep moving!
Move!
I said hurry!
Keep walking.
Officer, can we talk?
She ruined the quilts and bedding.
What a shame!
It's a mess!
Stupid tramp!
Scatter purifying salt!
Yes.
It was this morning.
She stabbed her heart with a kitchen knife.
No last words.
But I hear the balance, three in gold, went to the boss.
When she sold herself to raise the money, she'd already made up her mind.
It must've been hard for her every night.
She put up with it to avenge her father.
She didn't intend to live.
Excuse us.
Excuse us.
Who are you?
You want to bury her by yourselves?
Yeah.
She was our acquaintance.
We don't mind, less work for us.
Sounds good.
Okay.
Revenge is avenger's work.
If the targets are killed by the Shogunate, it's not revenge.
Oyumi's soul will never rest in peace.
You shouldn't have accepted it if you can't do the job.
The three in gold she gave her life for.
What'll we do about it?
Will you keep it until I finish?
What do you mean?
Like you said, her soul can't rest in peace.
But it's not for the same reason as yours.
But because the real killer is still alive.
What?
You're not lying, are you?
I saw what happened.
It looked like the horse kicked the old samurai.
It was a trick.
A guy who pretended to save the kid jumped in and broke the old samurai's neck.
Why didn't you say sooner?
My job was to get rid of the targets for the clients.
But it's different now.
I wouldn't care if she were alive but I can't lie to somebody who's dead.
I'll kill the real murderer and come for the balance.
Wait.
You talking about the guy who uses cross-shaped daggers?
Yes.
Then, there's someone who's behind him, right?
If you know why ask me?
Mother.
Ritsu, did you find him?
He's nowhere around.
I wonder where he is.
He's nowhere around.
I wonder where he is.
I wonder where he is.
Where could he have gone?
What's wrong?
Dear!
Son-in-law!
Dear!
That boy is gone.
While Ritsu and I were in the kitchen...
He disappeared?
Yes, like the wind.
Did you see a man around?
A man with a black hat and a cape?
I don't think so.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
I heard a noise and looked into the garden.
A noise?
Not a noise, more like...
Maybe a whistle.
I heard the whistle and I left the room for a second then...
Where are you going?
...I left the room for a second then...
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Son-in-law!
Sis!
Stay here.
Dad never loses.
Dad!
Dad!
Choji, stay here, don't move.
Okay?
Sis!
Dad!
Cry!
Yell!
Call for help!
Cry or I'll kill you.
Dad, don't come!
Dad!
Run!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Don't die, please!
Dad...
Don't die, please!
I won't die.
I'm all right, help me up.
We made it again, right?
Maybe because Omitsu came back we three could make it.
Dad.
What's wrong, be brave!
I still have one target left.
After I talked so big to the boss...
Do it for me.
I will, don't worry.
Omitsu...
Choji... I'm going to take a nap for a while.
I'll wake up soon.
Then we'll go on another trip, the three of us.
Does it hurt, Dad?
Not really.
Like this, I feel so warm and nice.
I really feel great.
It's too good for an avenger like me.
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Officer... lt's against the rules to do it for free.
Not free.
I'll do it too.
We shouldn't work without pay.
But doing nothing is worse.
We'll do it for his kids.
Let's go.
We don't know how numerous the enemy is, don't use the one-shot weapon.
We haven't got anything else.
Don't worry, I sell weapons in my store too.
What are these?
Grenades from Holland, don't pull the pins before tossing them.
I'll use these, let's go.
Magistrate, you're a fearful man.
You agitated those retainers and the paupers and you cleared that slum in only ten days.
It's hard to believe.
The Shogun is delighted.
He plans to build a temple there and dedicate it to Okiku.
I'm still amazed how pleased he is.
It seems like you can read his mind.
A man so thoughtful will be a perfect majordomo for the Shogun.
I greatly appreciate your recommendation, sir.
It was a short time, but the post of magistrate didn't suit me.
Maybe the job was too rough for a delicate man like you.
Anyway, let's have a drink.
Come closer.
Actually I'd rather explain why I wanted to know about the Shogun and Okiku.
Oh, I'd like to hear.
Speak.
I'm the younger brother of Okiku who was violated by the Shogun and killed herself.
What?
is that true?
Yes, sir.
Then, why did you do all this?
The Shogun is the man who killed your sister.
Why be so loyal to him?
Guess why.
Don't tease me!
I don't know what you're really thinking.
My sister's death taught me one thing...
Death is defeat.
So...
So?
You...
Why?
Now you know.
You've lost to me.
Just like the Shogun destroyed my sister.
What?
Then, do you intend to kill the Shogun for revenge?
You still don't get it?
I just use him to get us promoted.
Why would I want to bother him?
I've made it, so I don't need you anymore or should I say you're in the way.
Thank you for everything though.
Why you...
Give up already.
We'll tell people that you had a stroke.
Your family won't be disgraced.
Die like a man.
Die, die, die, die, die, die...
At last.
What took you so long?
How many corpses do you have to leave behind?
Aren't you so cool?
These guys told me that you're one of the avengers, right?
Good, do your job!
Try for my head!
Intruders, come, everyone!
Hurry!
Hey you!
Damn it!
What's going on here?
Nothing serious.
Calm down.
B-But... I said, calm down!
He's gone mad!
Hey you, come back here!
Come and get me!
Come on!
I still have my head.
Not bad.
You think that stump can reach my neck?
That's not fair...
Listen to the tragedy of poor Okiku...
Here.
Spend it in hell.
April the thirteenth.
It supposedly was the unluckiest day of the year.
And it had to happen on that day, of all days.
Bloodshed!
Bloodshed!
Well...
Kohei Yasuda, an apprentice officer, suddenly went wild and attacked the magistrate, Kenmotsu Nagao.
Nagao had taken fifty in gold from Yasuda under the table in exchange for promoting him to detective.
But he broke the deal.
So, Yasuda got mad and went on the warpath.
I shouldn't say this, but Nagao's the one to blame.
The whole thing was just ridiculous.
And we're the ones who suffered.
It happened at lunchtime, a food and tea were all over the place.
What a mess!
In these times, life is even dear to us samurai.
Nobody wants to die for some crumb.
All we could do was run around.
But the worst was Tanaka, the inspector.
Get out of my way, Tanaka!
O-Open the door!
Open, open the door!
I'm in here!
I'm in here, you heard me!
You idiot!
Oh no!
Help!
Run!
You bastard!
No!
Die!
Wait!
Die!
No violence!
Open it!
Please!
Open up, it's me!
The magistrate!
M-May I open it, sir?
Stupid, the killer's in there!
Wait a little longer!
We'll help you out!
Hang on until then!
Be patient and wait!
W-Wait, Kohei!
I apologize!
You'll get your money and promotion, I promise!
Too late!
Step aside!
Aside!
You saw?
You saw?
I almost got killed, didn't I?
It was a great relief to be alive.
But I was wrong.
Something much worse was waiting to happen much worse.
The verdict...
It's unforgivable, Mondo Nakamura, acting cowardly during the crisis.
You shall suffer a reduction in pay to half for the next six months.
You shall be rebuked.
Sir, that's too much!
What?
Why must only I be punished?
What about the others who locked us up and didn't do anything?
Silence, Nakamura!
Don't talk back!
Being rebuked I could take.
But I can't survive that long on only half-pay...
Enough!
Case closed!
What is with your attitude, you idiot!
I know how you feel, but it's the Shogun's judgment.
You just accept it!
Accept it?
They tricked me.
Damn it!
What's all this?
What day do you think it is, dear?
The new magistrate's coming, it's an important day.
You're being penalized now.
Be the first to welcome him, it's a good chance to win his favor.
It's not that easy...
Don't argue, dear.
Neighbor Murata left an hour ago.
I guess he's smarter than my son-in-law.
All right.
You want me to leave early with my half-pay, whatever makes you happy.
Ritsu.
Where's my breakfast?
You get no breakfast.
What?
We decided that the day the new magistrate arrives we set our minds, we won't eat breakfast till you draw full pay again.
Please, go, now!
Lord Ukyonosuke Okuda, the new south magistrate, has arrived!
What a young magistrate!
He's a pet of Prime Minister Sakai.
I hear he used to be a page, look at his clothes!
Think he'll make it as a magistrate?
The food and wine are from the new magistrate.
Appreciate it.
Yes sir.
What a luxurious food!
Very expensive.
Young one tries to show off?
What?
What is it?
It's a gold coin!
A gold coin?
It's a gold coin!
I got one too!
In the soup!
Is it real?
Real gold coin?
It's hot!
H-Hot!
Excuse me...
He's young but so thoughtful.
Anyway, let's wait for his toast.
All this fuss over one gold coin?
The magistrate's going to the castle.
You men stay and enjoy yourselves.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
You, what's your name?
Mondo Nakamura, sir.
So...
You're the one.
I've heard of you.
Huh?
Then I shall ask you now.
If something happens to me, don't forsake me.
Let's enjoy the dinner.
Oh yeah.
Let's go to that store.
This is a beautiful doll.
Wow, it's got a pretty face.
You guys ready?
The tragedy of poor Okiku.
She got a hairy corncob shoved deep inside her.
So poor Okiku drowned herself.
Ouch!
Hey, Nakamura!
Who are you singing about?
Better not be about Okiku, you should be praying for her soul.
What?
It wasn't an ordinary corncob, but the Shogun's.
She was humiliated and killed herself.
She had guts.
Try to act like her, okay?
Yes sir.
He's in a bad mood today.
I wonder what happened.
Who cares?
Well...
The hairy corncob sank deep...
Get that.
Yes.
He said, "don't forsake me"?
What a sense of humor!
Then what happened?
Nothing happened.
I felt rotten, so I came here to drink.
Give food to the paupers or something, it's on me.
Don't be ridiculous, giving away your money?
Can you afford it?
I know you're on half-pay.
Don't remind me, you're spoiling my sake.
It's true.
So...
Keep it for yourself.
Any news from your man?
No.
He went to look for a job two years ago and never came back.
You still call him your man?
Maybe you're right.
Why not flirt with me?
No.
Why not?
I don't want to flirt.
I want you to love me.
I'm serious.
You're lying.
Your face says...
You can't divorce your wife.
She'll kill you.
It's silly to be a man and a woman.
You think so?
They talk about what's flirting and what's love.
Is that all they can do?
Oh my!
The food's burning!
Hey...
Sugie came home.
Sugie?
You know, that young samurai.
He went for a job interview.
I wonder how it went.
Tinkerer.
Yes?
I haven't seen you before, are you new around here?
Yes, today is my first day here.
May I help you?
Well...
Lend me your anvil and hammer.
I'll do it myself, it won't take a minute.
*
Why did you do that, Sugie?
Well...
I want to forget that I'm a samurai.
That's why.
But what...
What happened to the job you mentioned?
I didn't get it.
This sword was a family treasure.
I tried to sell it to get money for someone who helped me.
Then I found out it's a fake.
But...
That made me decide to work as an umbrella maker.
And this is more useful for carving.
I feel sorry for Sugie.
Did he love that girl?
He'd planned to propose to her after he got the job.
But now he can't.
Get out our way!
Who are they?
Shogun's retainers, reckless samurai!
What is this?
It's a dead end.
What the hell, who brought us to this slum?
Kyuma!
Hey, what are you thinking bringing us to a dump like this?
I, Kyuma Kagazume will demonstrate my Megaki style leaping technique!
Next!
You, Koyata, do it!
Why not?
Here I go!
I'll go next, watch me!
Hold it!
Though poor, we have the right to live here.
There're old people and children too.
What if you injure someone?
Stop it!
What's that?
Hey, old man!
You, a samurai in some slum, dare criticize us, the Shogun's retainers?
You may be the Shogun's retainers, but you're still foolish!
What's that?
Step aside!
Look what you did!
Watch out!
No!
Father!
Father!
You all right?
Father!
You okay?
You all right?
Father!
What's wrong?
His neck is broken, ribs too.
What?
Murderer!
Murderer!
Murderer, murderer!
Get lost!
Murderer!
Give him back his life!
Give him back his life!
We didn't kill him.
The horse did.
The horse killed him, don't blame us.
Let's go.
W-W-Wait.
Stop!
Listen to me!
I know how you feel but don't make it worse.
Hey...
It's something you don't understand.
Huh?
Anybody know what happened to the horse?
It's over there!
This is...
It made the horse run.
But who did it, and why?
Nakamura.
Yes sir.
Your report states it wasn't just an accident.
You suspect treachery and wish to proceed with an investigation.
Yes.
I object.
Huh?
Your theory is absurd.
It's unfounded, I have to reject it.
Excuse me, but I have proof.
As I stated in there...
I found the cross-shaped dagger in the horse's leg.
And what dagger are you talking about?
I submitted it with the report, sir.
I never received any such thing.
Huh?
I can't believe it.
I absolutely...
Did either of you receive it?
Huh?
N-No, sir, I didn't.
Neither did I.
What are you talking about?
I handed it to you.
I'm sorry, sir.
I was wrong.
I'm certain it was just an accident.
Good.
That's better.
May I ask you one thing?
What will happen to the Shogun's retainers?
I was informed that they're under household arrest.
No further punishment is required.
Case closed!
Is Kyuzo here?
Yes, sir.
You left it at the scene.
It's not like you.
I'm sorry, sir.
That Mondo Nakamura is snooping around.
I don't think he's that sharp, but be careful.
Yes sir.
Oyumi, the soil...
Here you go.
I wonder who he was.
Huh?
The other guy who saved the kid.
What are you talking about?
You mean the old samurai wasn't the only one?
No.
I'm sure I saw him.
But did you see him?
I don't think so.
Me either.
Maybe you're mistaken...
You think so?
Why don't you ask the kid?
He doesn't live around here.
What?
Maybe he was just playing or just passing through, I'd never seen him before.
So the old samurai had to die trying to save a total stranger?
Boss, we're all here.
Please come out.
Yes.
Thanks for coming at this late hour.
I'll just get to the point.
We have three targets.
First...
Chikara Jinbo, the wild samurai leader.
Second...
Shinpachi Taro, his lieutenant.
Third...
Kyuma Kazazume, one of the gang.
They're the ones who caused the old samurai's death 10 days ago.
And about the fee...
I've received three in gold up front.
I'm supposed to have three more later.
Total of six in gold.
What?
Only six in gold for three targets?
If it's Shogun's retainers, ten per head is even cheap.
Only six for three targets.
You've got to be kidding me.
Please don't go!
I know it's not enough, I know it's not but it's all I could raise.
Please!
Please!
Please, avenge my father!
My father...
Go inside, don't worry.
I'll take care of this.
She's from a common family.
Imagine...
How she slaved to raise even three.
Not only that...
What she must do to raise rest of the balance.
Will any of you be kind enough to accept?
Let's go, officer.
You guys go.
I'll stay.
You'll stay?
You'll accept so little?
Edo avengers, some people!
You call six in gold "little"?
What?
Hey, traveler.
What did you just say?
Sorry if I provoked you.
It's just the howling of a hungry stray dog.
Boss.
Let me take the three targets.
I'll be glad to do it.
Wait a minute.
Boss.
I'll accept too.
Officer!
I have a reason, just let me.
Okay...
Then you two can decide how to handle it.
You'll talk and split the targets or work every man for himself.
You'll be paid as you get the targets.
We're strangers.
So we'll work separately.
Just like "capture the flag."
That sounds good.
I'll get moving right now.
Yeah!
Yeah!
If you're going to fall in love you should do it like this.
Give him a hug and tease him a little.
Give him a kiss and tease him a little more.
But what you really should do is this and that and everything!
Everything!
He's got a tiny one!
Hear that?
Murderer?
What of it?
Bring it on!
I'll kill you all!
Who's next?
Kyuma, you all right?
Shut up!
I'm a murderer!
Are you listening to me?
All right, all right.
Hey, take him to bed.
What's wrong with you?
Let's sing!
...you should is this and that and everything!
Everything!
Coming through.
It's down the hall.
What do you want?
Well, I brought a gift from our master like we promised.
Let's see.
Thanks.
By the way, about the other day...
Was that what you wanted?
We didn't mean to kill the old samurai.
What did the magistrate say?
Well...
He might ask you to pull another job pretty soon.
Sounds interesting.
Fine.
Tell him we accept.
Another job...
What's going on?
Shh...
Who are you?
Dad!
Somebody help!
What happened?
What's going on?
You idiot, get out of my way!
It was a Shogun's retainer.
He was decapitated and lying in a pool of blood.
How disgraceful!
It's dishonor to the Shogun.
They should behave themselves.
What are they thinking?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
How long do we have to wait?
Who needs you?
We'll avenge Kyuma.
Let's go.
Yeah!
Out of my way!
You're lucky.
If it were a bit more serious you'd lose your job as officer and avenger.
Anyway, you failed to kill and got hurt.
What a smart samurai!
Leave me alone.
Don't be like that.
We're all worried about you.
It's not worth getting hurt with that low fee.
Hey, officer.
They're kids but they're still samurai.
And they're wild and hot-headed too!
You might not be alive next time.
I heard that the new magistrate is in on this.
I don't think you should be doing this alone.
Actually...
I want to ask you guys a favor.
What favor?
About the new magistrate...
There is something fishy about him.
I want you to find out anything about him, will you?
Sure, by the way...
Have you changed your taste in women?
Eh?
Why?
She's been waiting outside.
What?
That brat!
What do you want?
Huh?
You know that I'm an officer, don't you?
Why are you following me?
I-I lost sight of my dad.
Don't lie to me.
What does your dad have to do with me?
Because you're both avengers!
You're after the same targets!
Keep it down!
That's why I thought if I followed you, I could meet him.
Is that so?
I want to talk to him too.
Follow me.
Why are you afraid?
He's your brother, isn't he?
But...
If Dad is here too he'll scold me.
Why would he do that?
I don't know.
Weird family.
Thanks.
But you were careless.
Sis!
Dad, please let me stay with you.
I'll go crazy without you and Choji.
I can't live away from you.
Dad, I'm begging you!
I know I'm not that smart but you can tell me what to do.
I'll change as you like.
I'll do whatever you say!
So, please Dad!
What brings you here?
I...
Not you.
I'm asking the officer.
I'll wait until you guys finish your family stuff.
I'm finished now.
Dad!
Don't "Dad" me.
I'm not your father.
Dad!
Leave!
What do you want?
I heard about an odd avenger using his kids.
So you're the one, Bunshichi.
Just answer the question.
You may be an oddball but last night you went too far.
Go away if you're meaning your wound.
Just listen.
We're both avengers.
We kill for money.
No point in killing other avengers.
Let's make up and share the targets.
Everybody is happy and peaceful.
What are you talking about?
You were the one who wanted to work separately.
I know, but...
No, I'm not interested.
I know but...
No, I'm not interested.
Listen.
I'll kill anything gets in my way.
That's how I work.
Get lost!
Hey!
Jerk!
I told you to leave!
Go, go, go!
No!
Go, go, go!
Leave!
Dad, please, Dad!
Leave!
Dad!
Get lost!
You bastard!
Stupid Dad!
Stupid...
Damn you!
Oh well, that's why I don't want kids.
Hey, you, come inside.
Drop in.
Hey, you there with the bandana!
How about you?
Come on.
No thanks.
Come on.
Hey handsome.
Why not come inside?
Jerk!
Please.
Please, come in.
Please.
Oh, I beg you.
Please drop in...
What a gloomy voice!
Hey, you, come here!
I haven't seen you in a while!
Hey, you, come here!
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go!
You, come here!
I told you!
You have to look more cheerful to get men, you idiot!
I'm sorry.
Sorry isn't going to do!
I don't care if your father was a samurai.
But you have to follow my rules now!
Work hard or else, got it?
Yes, ma'am.
Then go get a sucker, hurry!
Hey, won't you please come in?
Eh?
Hey, won't you please come in?
Hey, won't you please come in?
Nah...
Hey, won't you please come in?
Please sir, please!
No thanks!
Please sir, please!
Please sir, please!
Hey you!
Please sir, please!
This is my spot.
Scram!
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Hey.
What's the matter?
Hey...
Please come in.
You drunk?
I sure am.
I'm drinking the best stuff I have.
That's great.
By the way...
Any messages for me?
No...
Okay.
Thanks.
Well then let me drink your best stuff, too.
No.
Why be difficult?
Why did you try to court me?
Huh?
You were flirting with me.
Sometimes women want men to be serious even if they know the men are just flirting.
That's how we are.
You're mean, Nakamura.
What's wrong?
What happened?
Tell me.
Will you?
You'll feel better.
A friend of mine was going to Osaka so I asked him to take my letter.
To your man?
Yes.
But he was gone.
Gone?
He quit his job six months ago.
No one knows where he is now.
Would you believe it?
I couldn't help it...
I needed a drink.
Maybe this is how it should be.
I feel a little better.
As if a burden were removed.
Take me somewhere.
Anywhere...
For a few days...
The mountains, the sea, anywhere.
Will you take me?
Please.
Sure, Ofuku.
I have to take care of something first.
But I'll take you somewhere.
The shining sea might be good for you.
How about some island?
Well, I've got to go now.
I'm serious.
I promise.
Don't do anything stupid.
Sorry to keep you.
Anything new?
That young magistrate was promoted by Prime Minister Sakai.
Sakai brought him to the castle as a page.
Since then he's moved up amazingly fast.
And finally he became a magistrate.
But no one knows his history.
Was he a temple page?
Yeah, but I don't know which temple.
Some say he's a nobleman's son from Kyoto.
But others say he once was a prostitute.
A male prostitute?
Officer.
What sort of business are you into?
If that fishy guy is in on this, I don't want any part of it.
If something happens to you they're going find out about us, too.
I know.
A prostitute, huh?
Sounds likely.
Hey.
Officer.
Judging from what you told me, he must be Kyonosuke.
The age and the looks match too.
I've been in this business for a long time, but...
I don't think I've ever seen a guy as beautiful as him.
He had such soft and fair skin, damn it!
Officer.
To be honest, I'm still in love with him.
How long did he work here?
Well...
For a few years.
He was a fortunate boy.
With that face...
He became a Kabuki actor after Haginosuke ended up like that.
Hey hey, hold on.
...after Haginosuke ended up like that.
Hey hey, hold on.
Who is Haginosuke?
His rival.
One of them was supposed to be an actor but he committed a double suicide with a customer.
Oh?
Just before his big break?
Exactly sir.
It wasn't even somebody he was seeing...
He and his guest poisoned themselves the first night they met.
It was very strange.
Poisoned themselves?
Well, anyway because he died, Kyonosuke could leave this place.
I remember Kyonosuke.
He was a ham, but he looked beautiful on the stage.
Unlike this shack, it was a real theater downtown.
A real fancy one.
I still remember.
When Kyonosuke posed like this, the audience went wild!
It was certainly amazing.
Then, Enkoin Temple offered him a job as page.
Enkoin, the temple?
Yup.
A high-class temple where ladies-in-waiting go.
We were surprised when we heard that they'd invited him in there.
How did it happen?
I don't know well.
But I heard it was arranged by Lord Sakai, the temple magistrate then.
You mean the Prime Minister Sakai?
Yes.
But there was one problem.
The troupe leader refused to release Kyonosuke.
That's understandable.
He liked him very much.
But he gave in after all?
No choice, he died.
Died?
Was he poisoned?
I heard he was killed by a robber.
But no one was prosecuted so I don't know who did it.
Anyway...
Kyonosuke moved into the temple.
Rumor has it he became the Shogun's page later on.
The troupe leader's death was timely.
Over there.
Yes sir.
Thanks.
Here's a tip for you.
Thank you very much.
Big party tonight, eh?
For whom?
For Lady Matsuo, from the Shogunate.
Is that so?
Then, whose palanquin is that?
It belongs to Prime Minister Sakai, and his servants are here too.
Is he here, too?
Yes.
They came to pray for the Shogun's recovery.
Oh?
Thank you.
The Shogun's recovery?
Is he ill?
I hadn't heard about it...
Sorry I'm late.
Hurry!
Let me take his pulse.
Okiku...
Okiku...
Be brave, Shogun!
Okiku...
Pour for him.
Yes.
Come to think of it, it was a while ago...
The Shogun was well when he had this made.
He'd come here almost every day to entertain himself.
I heard that he enjoyed it especially with Okiku.
Yes.
Take a gook look!
In no way am I inferior to young pages!
That's what he used to say.
He would go into that room.
There he laid his hands on Okiku, the maidservant.
Hey, hey, hey.
No, please!
Please stop!
Please stop!
Please...
Please don't do this!
Please don't...
Come on.
Anyway I'm surprised you knew about it.
The Shogun had recurring nightmares saying "Okiku, Okiku forgive me!" in his sleep.
No one really figured out that it was about that maidservant, but...
How could you know?
We'll talk about it some other day.
Meanwhile...
Let's enjoy the climax.
Women's pleasure lasts till they turn into ashes.
How fortunate they are!
Prayers won't work.
To save the Shogun from his nightmares to remove the thorn, Okiku, from his mind your plan will be the best.
But he's very old.
We must hurry.
Yes.
I understand, sir.
Okiku rests in peace at the age of 19.
The tragedy of poor Okiku...
So, it wasn't just a song.
But what's the connection to the tenement houses in the village?
Him, why is he here?
Who's there?
Come out!
Or shall I come to you?
Mondo Nakamura.
I heard you were a lazy officer.
But I guess you're a hard worker.
Remember this...
Whatever you do, my position will not be affected.
Let me know when you change your mind and decide to work for me.
Since you're working hard, I can even have you promoted.
He's onto us now.
What'll we do?
We'll do it.
Have we a choice?
Shinpachi, what's keeping you?
Come on!
Hey, don't leave me alone.
Wait!
A top's spinning...
Ouch...
A top's spinning...
Dad!
Shinpachi!
Hey, what happened?
Who's there?
Wait!
Wait!
Run!
Wait!
Wait!
Hey, you, stop!
Hey, wait!
Shinpachi!
Shinpachi!
Stop there!
Wait!
Which way did he go?
Right or left?
Let's split!
Okay, I'll go this way.
We have to avenge Shinpachi, don't miss him!
Okay, put him down.
Shinpachi, Shinpachi, Shinpachi!
Damn!
Look!
What is it?
Are you blind?
This thickness and this radiance...
It's not a normal knife.
It's made from a sword.
A sword?
A sword that belonged to a samurai.
Find out who did it.
Shinpachi, don't worry.
I'll avenge your death.
Me too.
I promise, Shinpachi!
Shinpachi!
Shinpachi!
Shinpachi!
It's soaking.
We must take it apart and wash it.
But it's a brand new kimono.
A kimono's life depends on who wears it.
Poor kimono!
What were you doing to get so wet?
Working.
I know you were working, I'm asking what kind of work it was.
Watching a dangerous criminal.
With whom?
Nobody.
What happened to the criminal?
He died.
He died?
He was murdered.
Oh, you actually did such manly work?
Mother, Mother!
My husband was alone and...
I heard.
Use an umbrella next time you watch out murders.
What's that?
Maybe it's the dead man's friend here to get you.
Son-in-Law!
Take it easy.
Who is it?
Be careful, my dear.
You're...
My dad...
What?
Please help my dad.
Hey!
Who's the kid?
He's sick.
Sick?
Yes.
He has a fever, bring him in!
Yes.
No.
Yes.
Mother!
I want to make sure one thing first.
Son-in-Law, don't tell me he's your son.
Oh please, he has a father.
Are you sure?
Oh please, he has a father.
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
I'm serious!
I'm serious!
Fine, Ritsu, boil water.
Take him inside, son-in-law.
Don't hold him that way.
Keep his head higher.
How clumsy, hurry!
Dad, be brave!
Don't die, Dad!
Your brother asked me to come.
What happened?
I don't know.
When I got here, he'd been already injured.
I found this in his shoulder.
It's poisoned.
Dirty trick!
He came to.
You all right, Dad, be brave!
Dad!
It's me, Dad.
Why are you here?
Dad...
Leave...
But...
Get out!
Choji.
Who are you?
Relax, will you?
It's me.
It's you.
I'm keeping your kid.
Why do I have to take care of your kid?
Poor kid, he was drenched.
Why do you have to use your kids for killing?
I don't understand.
He's your own son, for god's sake.
No, he isn't.
I bought these two kids.
Bought them?
Yeah, so what?
If I hadn't, neither of them would have lived.
Their poor parents would've killed them.
Even so, they are still kids...
I'm just teaching them how to live.
I was also bought the moment I was born.
My foster father was an avenger, that's how it was.
I learned how to crush a man's face with my top.
The smell of blood, rolling human heads...
Yeah, I got used to such things.
It's like a merchant's son who learns accounting.
What?
Why so quiet, well, that's what happened.
If you're a real avenger don't look so glum.
Thanks for Choji.
You can leave now.
What now?
Meaning?
I guess she didn't mind the poison.
What do you mean?
She sucked it out.
You'll recover soon.
Maybe you bought her, but you should be nice to her.
She's no longer a kid.
She's a woman.
It happened about a month ago.
Dad.
What?
We did it a good job, didn't we?
Yeah.
You said I couldn't do it, but I did it, didn't I?
Sure.
You surprised me.
I'm glad to hear.
Saucy!
Shut up!
What's wrong?
We have to get up early tomorrow.
Omitsu.
What's the matter?
I've stayed away from her since.
I can use kids, but not a woman.
Women are too soft for this life-or-death racket.
I didn't know...
Sorry I made you talk.
Lousy work we have, huh?
Don't worry about your kid.
Oh, you're awake?
Your fever's down.
Good.
Your dad will be fine in a few days.
But don't tell anyone about our secret work.
Especially not my wife and mother-in-law.
Understand?
Good.
It's time for breakfast.
Ritsu.
That child looks that he's good enough to be a samurai's son.
Exactly, Mother.
I don't want to say this but he looks better than my son-in-law.
I wish we could adopt him as our successor.
Mother?
You get a divorce from your husband right away.
Then we can have another chance in life.
But that's going too far.
Ritsu, you can't stay young forever.
You must remarry while you can.
Now is the time to make up your mind.
Mother.
Actually I've been thinking about the same thing.
Isn't it too much, you two?
My dear.
Oh, son-in-Law.
My dear.
Don't forget, I'm a man, too.
There are women who'll love me.
Who would want to stay here?
Thanks a lot, good-bye!
Where are you going?
Don't worry.
Where are you going?
He'll come back.
Think so?
Of course, he always does.
Think so?
Of course, he always does.
I really wish he were dead!
Nakamura!
Oh, what happened?
I want to talk to you about my man, he's coming back!
What?
He wrote to me!
He opened a shop somewhere and he's coming to pick me up.
Would you believe it?
After making me worry so much, he's so selfish.
Don't you think so?
What'll I do?
What do you mean?
I'm scared.
Scared?
Is it all right that only I'll be happy?
I'm scared.
The gods may punish me.
Nonsense!
No gods will punish you.
Pray with me!
We can't go on a trip now.
Sorry.
Thank you.
I'll never forget you.
It's him that time.
Mr. Tinker!
You're the one who saved that child.
When the horse went wild, you and Hirano saved the kid.
I don't think so.
You're mistaken.
You don't need to hide it.
Unfortunately, Hirano broke his neck and died.
I've been wondering who the other man was.
I'm glad to find out.
I'll tell everyone about you, they'll give you more work.
You deserve it.
You're a hero.
Stay here.
Shogun's retainers!
They're here again!
Run for it!
They're here again!
What?
What do you want?
Get lost, murderer!
Get lost!
Whose dagger is this?
Mine.
It's been missing.
So, it's you!
If it's yours, you're the one who killed Shinpachi!
What?
Killed him?
You killed the old samurai, Hirano!
Yeah!
What, are you challenging us?
Sounds like fun.
We came to fight.
Let's do it.
Charge!
Dear!
What are you doing?
No one here?
I wonder what's going on.
Mr. Nakamura, what are you doing here?
Why do you care?
Can' t I sip tea?
It's no time for tea!
The Shogun's retainers again.
There're a lot of people injured and dead, all the officers went to the village.
Really?
Nakamura!
You're late.
Mr. Nakamura!
Ofuku!
Ofuku!
It's me, Nakamura, do you recognize me?
Your luck is returning.
Don't die.
I told you, the gods will punish me.
Ofuku!
Let me go!
Let go of me!
Give it up!
Listen, we only avenged our friends' deaths.
Why must we die?
Stop!
Fools!
Let me speak.
Magistrate Okuda started all this!
Kill them!
Out of my way!
What are you doing?
Damn it!
Why do we have to be evicted?
What did we do wrong?
Kick them out!
Hey, get moving!
Hurry!
Shut up!
Snap it up!
Walk!
Hurry, keep moving!
Move!
I said hurry!
Keep walking.
Officer, can we talk?
She ruined the quilts and bedding.
What a shame!
It's a mess!
Stupid tramp!
Scatter purifying salt!
Yes.
It was this morning.
She stabbed her heart with a kitchen knife.
No last words.
But I hear the balance, three in gold, went to the boss.
When she sold herself to raise the money, she'd already made up her mind.
It must've been hard for her every night.
She put up with it to avenge her father.
She didn't intend to live.
Excuse us.
Excuse us.
Who are you?
You want to bury her by yourselves?
Yeah.
She was our acquaintance.
We don't mind, less work for us.
Sounds good.
Okay.
Revenge is avenger's work.
If the targets are killed by the Shogunate, it's not revenge.
Oyumi's soul will never rest in peace.
You shouldn't have accepted it if you can't do the job.
The three in gold she gave her life for.
What'll we do about it?
Will you keep it until I finish?
What do you mean?
Like you said, her soul can't rest in peace.
But it's not for the same reason as yours.
But because the real killer is still alive.
What?
You're not lying, are you?
I saw what happened.
It looked like the horse kicked the old samurai.
It was a trick.
A guy who pretended to save the kid jumped in and broke the old samurai's neck.
Why didn't you say sooner?
My job was to get rid of the targets for the clients.
But it's different now.
I wouldn't care if she were alive but I can't lie to somebody who's dead.
I'll kill the real murderer and come for the balance.
Wait.
You talking about the guy who uses cross-shaped daggers?
Yes.
Then, there's someone who's behind him, right?
If you know why ask me?
Mother.
Ritsu, did you find him?
He's nowhere around.
I wonder where he is.
He's nowhere around.
I wonder where he is.
I wonder where he is.
Where could he have gone?
What's wrong?
Dear!
Son-in-law!
Dear!
That boy is gone.
While Ritsu and I were in the kitchen...
He disappeared?
Yes, like the wind.
Did you see a man around?
A man with a black hat and a cape?
I don't think so.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
I heard a noise and looked into the garden.
A noise?
Not a noise, more like...
Maybe a whistle.
I heard the whistle and I left the room for a second then...
Where are you going?
...I left the room for a second then...
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Son-in-law!
Sis!
Stay here.
Dad never loses.
Dad!
Dad!
Choji, stay here, don't move.
Okay?
Sis!
Dad!
Cry!
Yell!
Call for help!
Cry or I'll kill you.
Dad, don't come!
Dad!
Run!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Don't die, please!
Dad...
Don't die, please!
I won't die.
I'm all right, help me up.
We made it again, right?
Maybe because Omitsu came back we three could make it.
Dad.
What's wrong, be brave!
I still have one target left.
After I talked so big to the boss...
Do it for me.
I will, don't worry.
Omitsu...
Choji...
I'm going to take a nap for a while.
I'll wake up soon.
Then we'll go on another trip, the three of us.
Does it hurt, Dad?
Not really.
Like this, I feel so warm and nice.
I really feel great.
It's too good for an avenger like me.
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Officer...
It's against the rules to do it for free.
Not free.
I'll do it too.
We shouldn't work without pay.
But doing nothing is worse.
We'll do it for his kids.
Let's go.
We don't know how numerous the enemy is, don't use the one-shot weapon.
We haven't got anything else.
Don't worry, I sell weapons in my store too.
What are these?
Grenades from Holland, don't pull the pins before tossing them.
I'll use these, let's go.
Magistrate, you're a fearful man.
You agitated those retainers and the paupers and you cleared that slum in only ten days.
It's hard to believe.
The Shogun is delighted.
He plans to build a temple there and dedicate it to Okiku.
I'm still amazed how pleased he is.
It seems like you can read his mind.
A man so thoughtful will be a perfect majordomo for the Shogun.
I greatly appreciate your recommendation, sir.
It was a short time, but the post of magistrate didn't suit me.
Maybe the job was too rough for a delicate man like you.
Anyway, let's have a drink.
Come closer.
Actually I'd rather explain why I wanted to know about the Shogun and Okiku.
Oh, I'd like to hear.
Speak.
I'm the younger brother of Okiku who was violated by the Shogun and killed herself.
What?
Is that true?
Yes, sir.
Then, why did you do all this?
The Shogun is the man who killed your sister.
Why be so loyal to him?
Guess why.
Don't tease me!
I don't know what you're really thinking.
My sister's death taught me one thing...
Death is defeat.
So...
So?
You...
Why?
Now you know.
You've lost to me.
Just like the Shogun destroyed my sister.
What?
Then, do you intend to kill the Shogun for revenge?
You still don't get it?
I just use him to get us promoted.
Why would I want to bother him?
I've made it, so I don't need you anymore or should I say you're in the way.
Thank you for everything though.
Why you...
Give up already.
We'll tell people that you had a stroke.
Your family won't be disgraced.
Die like a man.
Die, die, die, die, die, die...
At last.
What took you so long?
How many corpses do you have to leave behind?
Aren't you so cool?
These guys told me that you're one of the avengers, right?
Good, do your job!
Try for my head!
Intruders, come, everyone!
Hurry!
Hey you!
Damn it!
What's going on here?
Nothing serious.
Calm down.
B-But...
I said, calm down!
He's gone mad!
Hey you, come back here!
Come and get me!
Come on!
I still have my head.
Not bad.
You think that stump can reach my neck?
That's not fair...
Listen to the tragedy of poor Okiku...
Here.
Spend it in hell.

S U R E ----- D E A T H R E V E N G E
The 13th of April.
It's said to be the unluckiest day of the entire year.
And it had to happen on just that very day.
Bloodshed!
Bloodshed!
Kohei Yasuda, a rookie at the magistrate's office, went wild and assaulted Kenmotsu Nagao, the magistrate.
It happened because Nagao took fifty gold pieces from Yasuda as a bribe to promote him to detective, but he didn't keep up his end of the bargain.
So, Yasuda blew his top and went after Nagao.
Maybe I shouldn't talk like this, especially above a whisper, but Nagao's the one to blame.
The whole thing's ridiculous, and we were the ones who suffered.
It had to happen at lunchtime.
What a mess!
Food and tea all over the place.
Life is dear to a samurai too at times like this.
Who wants to die for some jerk?
All we could do was run around.
But Inspector Tanaka was the worst.
I'm in here!
I'm in here!
You heard me!
No violence!
Please!
Open the door!
Open it!
It's me, the magistrate!
Shall we open it, sir?
Don't be stupid!
You'll let the killer in!
Wait a bit longer!
We'll help you!
Hang on until then!
Be patient and wait!
Wait, Kohei!
I apologize!
I'll give you back the money!
I'll get you promoted!
I promise!
Too late!
Die!
Stand aside!
Aside!
You saw?
You saw?
Wow, I was almost killed.
I thought it was all over.
It was a great relief.
But I was wrong, too hasty.
What followed was a disaster.
A really big disaster!
The verdict:
Mondo Nakamura, for your cowardly conduct during the crisis, your pay shall be reduced by half for the next 6 months, and you shall be severely rebuked.
Sir, that's too much!
What did you say?
Why must only I be punished?
What about the officers who locked us in?
Silence, Nakamura!
Don't talk back.
You're being rude.
Being rebuked is all right.
But I can't survive that long on only half pay.
No use arguing!
Case closed!
What an outrageous man!
Stupid!
I know how you feel, but it's the Shogun's judgment.
If you want to stay on the force, you'd better accept it.
Accept it?
They made a fool of me.
Accept it?
Dammit!
Do you know what day it is, dear?
The new magistrate's coming today.
It's an important day.
You're being penalized now.
It's your chance.
Be the first to meet him, and you could win his favor.
It's not that easy.
Don't argue, dear.
Murata from next door left an hour ago.
Murata's not being penalized, yet he went.
But you, son-in-law...
All right, all right.
I'm only drawing half-pay.
So I'll go?
Will that make you happy?
Ritsu, where's my breakfast?
Starting today, you get no breakfast.
No breakfast?
We decided that, starting the day that the new magistrate arrives, we won't eat breakfast.
Not until you're back on full pay.
Go quickly!
Lord Okuda, the new southern magistrate, has arrived!
What a young magistrate!
I hear he's a pet of Prime Minister Sakai.
He used to be a page.
Look at his clothes.
Think he'll make it as a magistrate?
The food and wine are from the new magistrate.
So appreciate it, understand?
What extravagant food!
It must've cost a fortune.
He's young, but wants to be taken seriously.
Just a kid, yet he's trying to act big?
Gold!
A gold piece!
I'm surprised!
He's young, but so thoughtful.
Well, let's drink to celebrate.
All this fuss over a piece of gold?
The magistrate's going to the castle.
You men stay and enjoy yourselves.
What's your name?
I'm Mondo Nakamura.
So you're the one.
I've heard about you.
What?
This is a good opportunity.
If something should happen to me, don't forsake me, understand?
"The tragedy of poor Okiku,"
"She got a hairy corncob,"
"Shoved deep in her snatch,"
"So she drowned herself."
"poor Okiku, was a tragedy... "
Hey, Nakamura!
Who are you singing about?
If it's Okiku, you'll be punished with blindness.
What?
It wasn't an ordinary corncob, it jutted from the Shogun.
She was humiliated and killed herself.
She had guts.
Try to be like her.
He's in a bad mood today.
What happened?
Who knows?
So, let's get on with it.
"The hairy corncob found its mark..."
He said, "Don't forsake me"?
That's a funny thing for a magistrate to say.
Then what happened?
This happened.
I felt rotten, so I came here to drink.
I'll pay for the paupers here.
Give them whatever food and drink you have.
Don't be ridiculous.
Drinking in broad daylight?
Anyway, can you afford it?
You're on half-pay.
Don't remind me.
You're spoiling the taste.
I bet I am.
Keep it for yourself.
Any news from your man?
No.
He went away to look for a job two years ago and never came back.
You still call him your man?
Maybe you're right.
Why not flirt with me?
I can't.
Why not?
I don't want to flirt.
I want you to love me.
I'm serious.
You're lying.
I can tell by your face that you won't divorce your wife.
She'll kill you.
How stupid to be a man and a woman.
Right?
Think so?
People love to talk about flirting and love and stuff.
Is that all they can do?
How awful!
The food's burning!
Hey, Sugie came home.
Sugie?
That young samurai.
He went for a job interview.
I wonder what happened.
Tinker.
Yes?
I don't think I've ever seen you.
Were you here before?
No, sir.
I'm new here.
May I help you?
Lend me your anvil and hammer.
I'll do it myself.
It won't take a minute.
Why do that, Sugie?
I can't forget I used to be a samurai while I'm wearing this sword.
Can't forget?
What about the job you mentioned?
I didn't get it.
This sword was a family treasure.
I tried to sell it to get money for someone who helped me.
Then I found out that it's a fake.
It helped me decide to earn a living by making umbrellas.
And this is better for that kind of trade.
I feel sorry for Sugie.
Did he love that girl?
He'd planned to marry her after he got the job.
But now he can't.
Who the hell are they?
The Shogun's retainers.
Reckless fools!
Hey, it's a dead end.
Who brought us to this pigpen?
Kyuma!
Hey, what can we do in a dump like this?
I, Kyuma Kagazume, will demonstrate my Magaki-school leaping technique!
Koyata, you're next!
Go!
Of course!
Here I go!
I'll go next.
Watch me!
Stop!
Though poor, we have the right to live here.
There's old people and children too.
What if you injure someone?
Stop it!
What?
Hey, granpa, you're nothing but a masterless samurai, and you dare criticize the Shogun's personal retainers?
You may be the Shogun's retainers, but you're still reckless!
What's that?
Step aside!
Look what you did!
Damn you!
Watch out!
Father!
Are you hurt?
Are you all right?
Father!
What's wrong?
His neck's broken.
Ribs too!
What?
Murderer!
Murderer!
Murderer!
Murderer!
Get off me!
Murderer!
Bring him back to life!
Yes!
Bring him back to life!
We didn't kill him.
The horse did.
The horse kicked him.
Don't call us murderers.
Let's go!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Lay off!
I know how you feel, but don't make it any worse.
There's something I don't understand.
Anybody know what happened to the horse?
It's over there!
It was this.
This made the horse bolt.
But who did it?
And why?
Officer Nakamura.
Yes, sir.
Your report states it wasn't a mere accident.
You suspect treachery and wish to proceed with an investigation.
Precisely, sir.
I reject this.
Why?
Your theory is absurd.
Since it's unfounded, I must reject it.
Sir, it's not unfounded.
It's based on fact.
As stated, the shiruken which had stabbed the horse...
Shiruken?
What shiruken are you talking about?
I submitted it together with the report, sir.
I don't think I received it.
I can't believe it.
I absolutely...
Did either of you receive it?
What?
No, sir, not me!
Neither did I.
Don't lie.
I handed it to you, I know I did.
I'm sorry, sir.
It was my error.
It was merely an accident.
There's no mistake.
I'm glad you understand.
May I ask you one thing?
What will happen to the Shogun's personal retainers?
The superintendent informs me they're under house arrest.
Evidently no other punishment is required.
Case closed!
You are dismissed.
Is Kyuzo here?
Yes, sir.
You left evidence at the scene.
It's not like you.
Sorry, sir.
That ass Mondo Nakamura is snooping around.
I don't think he's much to worry about, but it's best to be careful.
Very well, sir.
Oyumi, the soil.
Here, have some more.
I wonder who he was.
Huh?
That other man.
The one who saved that kid during the row.
What other man?
You trying to say that the old samurai wasn't the only one?
Yes.
I'm sure I saw him.
Did you see anybody like that?
No.
I don't think so.
Me neither.
Maybe you're wrong.
I wonder.
Why not ask that kid.
He'd know.
But... he doesn't live around here.
What?
Maybe he just came to play or was only passing through.
Anyway, I'd never seen him before.
So an old samurai had to die trying to save a total stranger?
Boss Benten, we're all here.
Please come out.
Very well.
Thank you for coming at this late hour.
I'll get straight to the point.
This time we have 3 targets.
First, the leader of the reckless samurai, Chikara Jinbo.
Second, his lieutenant, Shinpachi Tarao.
Third, their fellow samurai, Kyuma Kagazume.
They were responsible for the death of that old samurai 10 days ago.
Next, our fee.
The client has paid an advance of 3 pieces of gold.
The promise is to pay another 3 later.
So the total will come to 6 gold pieces.
Only 6 gold pieces for 3 targets.
If the targets are real samurai, it's worth at least 10 per head.
Only 6 gold pieces for 3 targets?
Don't be ridiculous!
Please don't go!
Please!
I know it's not enough.
But it's all I could raise.
Please!
I beg you!
Please avenge my father's death!
My father's death!
Go back inside.
I'll do my best.
She's from a poor family.
You can imagine what she's had to do, to raise even 3 gold pieces as an advance.
That's not all.
Imagine what she'll have to do to raise the rest.
Will any of you accept for her sake?
Officer, let's go.
You people go first.
I'll stay.
Stay?
You mean you'll do it for so little?
Are you Edo assassins?
Some people!
You call 6 whole gold pieces "little".
What?
You're a traveler?
Did you speak?
Sorry to intrude.
It's only the howling of a stray dog.
Boss Benten,
Let me take the 3 targets you mentioned.
Wait a minute!
Boss, I accept.
All right?
Officer!
I have my reasons.
Let me do this.
Then, the two of you settle the operation between yourselves.
Will you share the targets?
Or will you go for them on your own?
Whatever, you'll be paid each time you hit a target.
We're strangers.
We should do it by ourselves.
How about it?
That's the best offer I've had.
I'll get right to it.
Hey, he's got a tiny one!
What a weenie winky!
Murderer?
So what?
No matter how many come, I'll kill them!
Next!
Come on!
What's wrong?
You all right?
Shut up!
I'm a murderer!
So what?
Asses!
Sure, Kyuma.
Sure.
Hey, take him to bed, huh?
Please wait in here.
Hello.
What do you want?
We brought you what our master promised.
Let's have a look.
Thanks.
By the way, about that row, do you think it was enough?
An old samurai died.
We hadn't planned on that.
What did the magistrate say?
Ah, yes.
He said he might ask you to pull another job.
Sounds good.
Tell your master we accept.
"Another job"?
What's going on?
Who are you?
Dad!
What a disgrace!
It's an insult to the Shogun.
They call themselves his retainers?
What can they possibly be thinking?
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
How long are you going to keep us here?
Who needs those idiot policemen?
We'll avenge Kyuma by ourselves!
Let's go!
Yes, sir!
Clear the way!
You were nearly killed.
If this was more serious, you'd lose your job, as a police officer and an assassin.
You missed your target and got hurt in the bargain.
Great samurai.
What do you care?
Lay off.
You're too old to show off.
Can't you see we all worry about you?
All because you took a job that doesn't pay.
Listen Officer, they may be kids, but they're still samurai.
And hotheaded to go with it.
If they get mad, wounding you won't be enough.
What's worse, I hear that the magistrate's involved in this.
You'll never be able to handle it alone.
To be perfectly honest, I have a favor to ask.
What favor?
About the magistrate Otama just mentioned.
I've always thought he was a bit suspicious.
Check up on the man, will you?
His family... whatever you can find.
Sure, we'll do it.
Incidentally, have you changed your taste in women?
What?
What are you talking about?
You've a young girl waiting for you.
Huh?
That little bitch!
What do you want?
Well?
If you lie to a policeman, you'll be in trouble.
Why are you following me?
I lost sight of my dad.
Don't lie to me!
What've I got to do with your dad?
You've got plenty to do with him!
You're both assassins.
You're both after the same targets.
Keep it down, you fool!
So,
I thought, if I follow you, I'll catch up with him sooner or later.
Is that so?
I have something to discuss with your dad, too.
So follow me, if you like.
Why are you so afraid?
He's your brother.
But, if Dad's with him, he'll scold me.
Scold you?
Why?
I don't know.
You're father and daughter?
Odd people!
Good work, son.
But you were careless.
They followed you.
Sis!
Dad, please!
Let me stay with you again!
I'll go crazy if I can't live with you and Choji.
I can't live away from you.
Please Dad!
Please let me stay!
I'm stupid, so I can't understand if you don't tell me.
If there's something wrong with me, I'll change.
I'll do as you say.
Please Dad!
What brings you?
I...
I'm not talking to you.
I'm asking the policeman over there.
Seems you've got a problem there.
I can wait until you've finished.
Not necessary.
I'm finished now.
Dad!
Didn't I tell you to stop calling me that?
You're not my daughter.
Dad!
Get lost!
What's on your mind?
I heard about this assassin whose kids are his killing partners.
So you're Bunshichi, the top vendor, huh?
You haven't answered my question.
You may be an oddball, but don't you think you went too far last night?
You mean about your wound?
Take it to a doctor.
Listen, we're strangers.
We kill and get paid for it.
But there's no sense in killing other assassins, right?
So let's make peace and share the other two targets.
Then everything will be fine.
How about it?
Wait a minute.
You were the one who wanted to work on his own, right?
I know.
I came to discuss it.
Sorry, I'm not interested.
Look, I've lived by getting rid of anybody who stands in my way.
And I'll keep on living that way.
So leave!
Hey!
Suit yourself.
Get away from us!
Go on!
Go!
Get lost!
Leave!
Dad!
Please!
Get lost!
Dad!
Get off!
No!
Please, let me stay!
Let me stay!
Please!
Poor kid!
That's why I don't want any.
Drop in.
Come on in.
You'd pass up a beauty like me, would you?
You're celibate?
No thanks.
Want a good time?
I can love you all night long.
Limp dick!
Hey, come with me, please?
Come with me?
Come on in with me, please?
Why not come inside with me?
What?
You sound like you're going to a funeral.
Look who it is!
Back for more, eh?
I just couldn't stay away from you!
You'd better get ready!
Stop that!
Get in here!
How many times must I tell you?
You'll never get picked up if you look miserable!
I'm sorry.
Apologies won't help you.
You may have been a samurai's daughter, but you're here to work.
On your back!
Or you'll be punished!
Yes.
Now go hook a sucker, and hurry!
Hey, you want a little loving?
Please!
Please, come with me!
Hey, this is my spot.
Scram!
I'm sorry.
Hey, what's wrong?
Well, you're welcome.
You're already drunk?
I sure am.
Today I'm drinking my best booze.
Yeah?
Great, huh?
By the way, has a young boy brought a message for me?
Not that I know of.
Is that so?
Never mind.
Let me have some of your best booze, too.
No.
Why be difficult?
How come you courted me?
Huh?
You've courted me many times.
No, it's only in my dreams.
You know, women sometimes want men to be serious, even when they know the guys are only flirting.
You're mean, Nakamura.
What's wrong?
What happened?
Tell me, and maybe,
maybe it'll make you feel better.
A friend of mine was going to Osaka, so I asked him to take a letter.
To your man?
Yeah.
But he'd gone.
Gone, huh?
They say he quit 6 months ago, and no one knows where he went.
Would you believe it?
I can't help but sit here and drink.
But, maybe this is how it should be.
It makes me feel a little better,
Like someone took a load off my back.
Listen, will you take me somewhere?
I'd love to get away for a few days.
The mountains, even a field... anywhere will do.
Will you take me with you?
Please.
Sure, I'll take you some place, Ofuku.
But right now, I have something to do.
When I'm finished, I'll take you somewhere.
The sea, lots of sun - that'll be best.
How about we go to Enoshima Island?
But now, I have a job to do.
Really, I promise.
So don't despair, all right?
Sorry to keep you.
Find out anything?
Okuda became magistrate because Prime Minister Saki arranged it.
He'd been a page at a temple.
Then Lord Saki brought him to the castle as a page for the Shogun.
After that he moved up fast and got to be a magistrate.
But the years before that, nobody knows much.
A temple page, huh?
Right.
But I don't know which temple.
Some say he's the bastard son of a Kyoto nobleman.
Others say he was a homosexual.
What?
A homo?
Officer, what're you mixed up in?
If something happens to you, it could affect all of us.
Think about what might happen.
Leave it alone, before you get hurt.
I know.
A homosexual, eh?
Sounds likely.
Hey, where're you going?
Judging from what you say, he must be Kyonosuke.
Age, height... it all fits.
I've been in this racket a long time.
I don't think we'll ever see his sort again.
He had such soft, fair skin, so wonderful to the touch.
Dammit,
I'm ashamed, but I'm still in love with him.
How long was he here?
Well, only a few years.
Kyonosuke was a lucky boy.
He was so beautiful, that Kabuki theatre invited him to be an actor.
And he could go after what happened to Haginosuke.
Hold on.
Just who's Haginosuke?
Kyonosuke's rival.
One of the two was to be recommended to the theatre.
Then, all of a sudden, Haginosuke and his guest committed suicide.
With such a bright future waiting?
Stupid kid!
That's fate, Officer.
It might have been more logical if they had known each other longer.
But they took poison on the very first night they met.
It was odd no matter how you look at it.
They poisoned themselves, huh?
Anyway, because Haginosuke died, Kyonosuke got out of this den.
That's the story, Officer.
Kyonosuke?
I remember him well.
He was a real ham.
But on stage he looked beautiful.
I don't mean in this dump.
A big theatre in the center of town.
I still remember.
Whenever Kyonosuke posed like this, the crowd went wild and I mean a full house.
It was amazing.
Then Enkoin Temple offered him a job as a page.
Enkoin Temple in Yanaka?
Yeah.
It's a high-class temple.
The Shogun's ladies-in-waiting used to go there to pray.
In fact, I think they still do.
It surprised us when they scouted him.
Who started the whole thing?
I'm not sure,
but I hear that the temple magistrate at the time,
Lord Sakai, arranged it personally.
Lord Sakai?
You mean Prime Minister Sakai?
Yes.
But there was some trouble.
The troupe leader refused to release Kyonosuke.
That's understandable.
He was crazy about him.
But, he let him go after all, huh?
He had no choice.
He died.
Died?
Don't tell me he poisoned himself too?
They said a robber killed him.
But the robber was never found.
So nobody really knows.
Anyhow, Kyonosuke went to Enkoin Temple and no one objected.
Rumor has it he finally got to be a Shogunate page.
The troupe leader's death was very timely, huh?
ENKOlN TEMPLE
Many thanks.
Here's a tip.
May Buddha bless you.
It was a big procession, huh?
Who came to pray this evening?
Ah, Lady Matsuo from the Shogunate was here.
Really?
Then that luxurious palanquin there, whose is it?
That one?
It belongs to Prime Minister Sakai.
Yeah?
Then, the Prime Minister's here too?
Yes.
He and Lady Matsuo came to pray for the Shogun's recovery.
Thanks for telling me.
The Shogun's recovery?
He's ill?
I hadn't heard.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Come closer to the Shogun.
Hurry.
I'll take his pulse.
Okiku...
Okiku...
Be brave, sire!
Get well!
Okiku...
Forgive me...
Pour wine for Okuda.
Of course.
Thinking about it, the Shogun was well when he had this room made 3 years ago.
He'd come here almost everyday so he could enjoy himself.
I hear he did it himself when Okiku was here.
He said, "Take a good look, everybody."
"In no way am I inferior to young pages."
Then he went into that room, and screwed Okiku the maid,
who just happened to be there.
Please leave me alone!
Don't!
Stop!
Please stop!
Please stop!
Please don't!
Please stop it!
Strange.
I'm surprised you knew.
The Shogun has recurring nightmares every night.
"Okiku!
Okiku, forgive me!" he keeps saying.
But no one remembers the incident.
How is it that you happen to know?
Maybe we'll talk about it someday.
But right now, wouldn't you rather watch the climax?
They say women are lecherous right to the grave.
How enviable they are!
The prayers of the priests won't work.
To save the Shogun from his dreams and purge Okiku from his mind,
The plan you thought up will be the best.
But he's old, you know.
We have to hurry.
Remember that.
Yes, sir.
I'm quite aware of that.
"Okiku.
"Died age 17."
"The tragedy of poor Okiku..."
So it wasn't just a song, it was fact.
But how will it affect the poor people who live here?
Him!
Why is he here?
Who's there?
Come out!
Or shall I come in?
Mondo Nakamura!
I heard you're the laziest man in the south magistrate precinct.
But you're working hard tonight.
I appreciate it.
But remember this:
Whatever you examine, no matter what you find out, it won't affect me in the slightest.
So why not change your mind and work for me, instead?
Come see me anytime.
I'll have you promoted for your efforts tonight.
See?
He's wise to us.
What do you suppose we should do?
Do we have any choice?
We'll act.
Hey, Shinpachi, what's keeping you?
Hurry up!
Dammit, don't leave me behind.
Hey!
Wait for me!
I'm so very drunk!
Stupid top!
I'm so very drunk!
Get off!
I'll get rid of it somehow.
I'm cut!
What's going on there?
Who are you?
Wait right there!
Stop him!
Get him!
Stop!
You stop there!
He's been killed!
Shinpachi!
After him!
Where did he go?
Dammit!
Right or left?
We'll split up!
Good idea!
I'll go this way.
He killed Shinpachi.
Don't lose him!
This is fine.
Put him down.
Shinpachi!
Shinpachi!
Shinpachi!
What's this?
Look!
What's that?
Are you blind?
See how broad and sharp it is?
It's no ordinary knife.
It's made from a samurai sword, although a cheap one.
A sword?
What type of samurai doesn't need his sword anymore?
Then you can guess who did it, right?
Shinpachi, don't rest in peace too soon.
Wait until I avenge your death.
I promise!
Me too!
Me too!
I promise, Shinpachi!
Shinpachi!
It's soaking.
I'll have to take it apart and wash it.
But it's a brand new kimono.
A kimono lives or dies depending on the man who wears it.
For this kimono, I feel sorry.
Dear, what were you doing to get so wet?
Working, of course.
That much I can guess.
What kind of work, dear?
I was watching a dangerous criminal.
With whom?
Nobody.
And what happened to this dangerous criminal?
He died.
Died?
Somebody murdered him.
Oh!
You actually experienced such manly work?
Mother!
Mother!
My husband was all alone, and...
I heard.
Next time, use an umbrella when watching, understand, Son-in-Law?
What's that?
Who could it be?
It could be that dead man's friend who's come to get you.
Son-in-Law!
Don't panic, Mother.
Who is it?
Be careful, dear.
My dad...
What?
Please help my dad.
Who's that boy?
He's sick.
Sick?
He has a fever!
Bring him in!
Don't bring him in here.
Mother!
Before taking care of him, there's something we have to make sure of.
Son-in-Law, is he an illegitimate son of yours?
Stop kidding around!
He has a father, who's waiting for him.
Can I take it that you're telling us the truth?
Why must you needle me?
That's a relief.
Ritsu, boil some water.
Wait!
Don't hold him that way.
Keep his head higher.
What an oaf!
Hurry!
Dad, be brave!
Don't die!
Dad!
Hey!
It's only me.
Your brother came and got me.
What happened?
I don't know.
I found him wounded and lying on the ground.
This was in his shoulder.
It's poisoned.
Someone applied poison to it.
What a dirty trick!
He's coming around.
Dad.
You all right?
Be brave!
Dad!
It's me, Dad.
Why are you here?
Dad.
Get out!
Don't say that.
Get out!
Choji.
Choji.
Who are you?
Relax.
It's me.
Me.
Oh, it's you.
Your boy's with me.
Why is it me that has to take care of your son?
Poor kid!
He was drenched.
You use your own kid as a tool for murder.
What's wrong with you, anyway?
Is that the way a father and son should be?
He isn't my son.
I bought the two kids a while ago.
You bought them?
Don't glare at me.
If I hadn't bought them, they'd both be long dead.
Their parents would have killed them and buried them in a paddy field.
That's still no reason to use kids.
I'm teaching them how to live, like my old man taught me.
I was bought too, as soon as I was born.
And the man who bought me was an assassin.
That's how it was.
I learned how to smile in a swordfight, and how to fling a top to crush a man's face.
The stench of blood...
rolling human heads.
They're nothing once you get used to them.
Like a merchant's son who learns accounting almost automatically.
Why so silent?
That's how it happened.
If you're a real assassin, don't look so glum.
It doesn't suit your work.
Thanks for taking care of Choji.
You can leave now.
What about you?
What about me?
Maybe she never thought she could get poisoned too.
What?
She sucked out the poison.
Your fever will go down soon.
You may have bought her, but be nice, or the gods will punish you.
She's no longer a kid.
She's a woman now.
It happened when we worked together a month ago.
Dad?
Yeah?
Today's work... we did it, huh?
Sure.
You said I couldn't do it, but I did.
Right.
You surprised me, Choji.
I'm glad.
Saucy kid!
Shut up!
What's wrong?
Go to sleep.
We have to get up early.
Omitsu?
What's wrong?
Since then I've kept away from her.
I can use kids, but not women.
Women are too soft for these life-or-death situations.
Really?
Sorry I made you talk about it.
What lousy work we're both in, huh?
Don't worry about the boy.
So, you're awake?
Your fever's gone down.
Good.
And your dad will be all right in a few days too.
Listen, don't tell anyone about our secret work, okay?
Especially not my wife or that old battleaxe.
Got it?
Good.
It's almost time for breakfast.
Listen Ritsu.
That child's eyes, nose and mouth... the way he looks.
Don't you think he's good enough to be a samurai's son?
You think so, Mother?
I hate to grumble, but he looks so much better than my son-in-law.
Maybe you could adopt him as the Nakamura heir.
What?
Then you can divorce that clod, and we can have a chance of happiness.
How about it?
That's going too far.
Ritsu, you can't stay young forever.
You can find a proper husband easily.
I think it's the time for you to decide.
To be honest, Mother, I've been thinking the same since last night.
That's some plot you've cooked up.
- Dear!
- Son-in-law!
No kidding!
I'm a man too, you know.
And I have a woman who wants me to take her away someplace.
Who'd want to stay in a haunted house like this?
Thanks for nothing.
Goodbye!
- Dear, where are you going?
- Don't worry.
He'll be back.
- Are you sure?
- Unfortunately.
He always comes back.
Stupid clod!
Why can't he drop dead?
Nakamura!
Oh?
What's up?
I want to talk.
My husband says he's coming for me.
What?
I got a letter.
He worked hard and made enough to open a shop.
He said to wait till he comes for me.
Would you believe it?
After making me worry so much.
Don't you think he's selfish?
So selfish!
What should I do?
Do about what?
- I'm a little scared.
- Scared?
Is it all right that only I be happy?
I'm scared.
Do you think the gods will be jealous and punish me?
Don't be asinine!
What gods would punish you for that?
Pray with me.
So, we don't get to go to Enoshima Island, huh?
Sorry.
But thanks anyway.
I'll never forget your kindness.
It's him!
It's the one I saw.
Mr. Tinker!
You're the man who saved the boy.
What?
When the horse went wild, you and Hirano saved the little boy.
Not me.
I think you're mistaken.
I never did anything like that.
Don't be modest.
Poor Hirano broke his neck and died.
I've been wondering who the other man was.
I'm glad I found you.
I'll tell everyone about you.
If they know how brave you were, they'll give you more work.
You certainly deserve it.
Stay here, all right?
The samurai!
That wild gang!
- They're back again!
- Here they come!
What do you want?
Get lost!
Whose is it?
Mine.
I lost it a few days ago.
I've been looking for it.
So, it's you!
If it's yours, then you're the one who killed Shinpachi!
- I killed him?
- Watch your tongue!
You guys are the ones who killed the old samurai Hirano.
What?
Are you challenging us?
Sounds like fun.
We came to fight too.
So let's fight!
What are you doing?
Is it a special day?
Nobody's here.
What's it all about?
Nakamura, what are you doing here?
What's it to you?
What's wrong with sipping tea?
You shouldn't.
That wild gang of samurai went to the slum to fight.
A lot of people were killed or injured.
The other officers went there hours ago.
What's that?
Nakamura, you're late!
Nakamura!
Ofuku!
Ofuku!
It's me.
Nakamura!
Luck's on your side.
Don't die!
No, luck had deserted me.
Ofuku!
Let me speak to the superintendent!
We only avenged our friends' death!
- There's no reason for hara-kiri!
- Silence!
- What poor losers!
- I must tell you this!
Magistrate Okuda started it all!
He told us to do it!
Kill them!
What did we do?
Tell me.
- Why must we leave?
- All of them!
I've lived here all my life!
All of you!
Move it!
Hurry!
Get going!
Move it!
Move!
Snap it up!
Move it!
Faster!
Keep moving!
Officer, can we talk?
She ruined the quilts and bedding.
What a tramp!
She was a real pest.
Scattering purifying salt!
- She won't bother you any more.
- Good riddance.
She died this morning - stabbed herself in the heart with a kitchen knife.
She didn't leave any last words, but I hear the balance, 3 pieces of gold, was given to the boss last night.
When she sold herself to raise the money, she'd already decided.
It must have been painful to give herself to slobs every night.
She put up with it to avenge her father's death.
I kind of think she'd planned to end it like this.
Excuse us.
Excuse us.
Who are you?
Are you saying you'll bury her by yourselves?
Yes.
We used to know her.
It'll be less work for us.
Good!
Be our guest.
Yes.
Assassins are meant to satisfy people's craving for vengeance.
If the Shogunate kills the targets, our clients feel cheated.
Joining her father like this, Oyumi can't rest in peace.
If you dunces couldn't do the job, you should never have accepted it.
Only 3 gold pieces, and she gave her life for them.
What'll we do about it?
Keep them until I finish the job.
What do you mean?
As you say, her soul can't rest in peace.
But it's not for the reason you mentioned.
The real killer is still alive.
What?
Don't tell me you're lying.
No.
I saw what happened.
It looked like the horse kicked the old man, but it was a trick.
A guy who pretended to save the kid, actually jumped the old samurai and broke his neck.
Why didn't you tell us sooner?
My job was to only get rid of the targets for our client.
But now it's different.
Maybe I wouldn't care if she were alive.
But now that she's dead...
I'll kill the real murderer and then come for the balance.
Hold on.
Are you talking about the guy who uses the shiruken?
Then there's somebody else behind all this, right?
If you know, why ask?
Mother!
- Ritsu, did you find him?
- No.
He's nowhere around.
- Oh?
I wonder where he is.
- Where could he be?
What's wrong?
- Dear!
- Son-in-law!
That boy disappeared.
While Ritsu and I were in the kitchen.
- He disappeared?
- Like the wind.
Did you see a man around?
A guy with a black hood and a mantle?
I don't think so.
Are you sure?
Yes.
I thought I heard something in the garden, but there was nothing there.
What kind of noise?
Well, not really a noise...
More of a whistle.
Brief but sharp.
Ritsu went to the garden, and I looked in my room, but the boy was gone.
- Dear, where are you going?
- Son-in-law!
- Sis!
- Relax.
Don't go.
Dad won't lose.
Dad!
Dad!
Choji, stay put, okay?
Sis!
Dad!
Cry!
Yell!
Call for help!
Yell, or I'll kill you!
Call for him!
He's overthere!
Dad!
Don't die!
- Dad!
- Don't die!
- Dad!
- Don't die!
Don't worry.
I won't die.
I'm all right.
We made it again, right?
Because the three of us came together again.
Dad.
What's wrong?
Get tough!
I missed one target.
What a shame...
after I bragged to Boss Benten.
Do it for me.
Sure.
Don't worry.
Omitsu...
Choji...
Let your dad rest a while.
Don't worry.
I'll wake up soon.
Then we'll take another trip, the three of us, all right?
Does it hurt, Dad?
Not really.
Living with you kids makes me feel so good, so wanted.
Really.
I love it.
It's too good for a punk assassin like me.
- Dad!
- Dad!
- Dad!
- Dad!
Officer, you're breaking the rules by doing it for free?
It's not for free.
I think I'll go too.
Yeah, assassins shouldn't act until they're sure of getting paid.
Still, doing nothing is even worse.
We'll do it for those two kids.
Let's get at it.
We don't know how many we'll have to fight this time.
That stuff only works once.
We better not use it.
We haven't got anything else.
Leave it to me.
Don't forget, I'm good at things like this.
What the hell are these?
Grenades from Holland.
Don't pull the pins until you throw them.
I'll use these.
Let's go!
Magistrate Okuda, you're a frightening man, aren't you?
You got those wild samurai and the peasants... to clear that slum in only 10 days.
It's hard to believe.
The Shogun is delighted.
He plans to build a temple there and dedicate it to Okiku's soul.
I'm amazed how happy he was.
It's like you can read his mind without even seeing him.
A man so thoughtful will be perfect as the Head Steward to the Shogun.
I appreciate your recommendation, sir.
The post of magistrate doesn't suit me.
Maybe the job's too rough for a handsome man like you.
Anyway, let's drink to it.
I'll pour for you.
Come closer.
Thank you, sir.
Actually, though, it's time to explain why I wanted to know... about the Shogun and the maid servant Okiku.
Yes, I'd like to hear.
Tell me.
Okiku was my older sister.
She was raped by the Shogun and drowned herself from shame.
What?
Is that true?
Yes, sir.
Then, why have you been doing all this?
Maybe I shouldn't be so blunt, but the Shogun caused your sister's death.
Why are you being so loyal to him?
Can't you guess why, sir?
Stop teasing me!
I have no idea what you're thinking.
My sister's death taught me a great thing:
Death is defeat.
So, sir...
So?
Okuda... why this?
Now you know.
You've lost to me.
Just like the Shogun destroyed my sister.
Damn you!
Then you plan to ruin the Shogun and his family for revenge?
You still can't tell?
The Shogun is the man I'll use to get promoted.
Who'd touch such an important person?
This new job will allow me to function directly under him.
So I don't need you anymore, see?
Maybe it should be "You're in the way,"
rather than "I don't need you anymore."
Dammit!
Just be quiet and give up.
We'll announced that you've died of a stroke.
Then your family won't be disgraced.
So just give up and die in peace.
Die fast!
Die!
Die!
Die!
Die!
Die!
Die...
Isn't this a great success?
Ha!
Who's there?
You missed the show.
How many corpses must you leave in your wake?
Did you come just to show off?
We've checked.
We know that you're one of the assassins.
Excellent!
Do your job!
Try to take my head!
Intruders!
Come, everyone!
- Magistrate Okuda, what's going on?
- Nothing serious.
Calm down.
I said, calm down!
What's wrong, old man?
I still have my head.
You're good, huh?
Come!
Come!
You think you can reach me with that stump?
Is this possible?
"The tragedy ofpoor Okiku,"
"She got a..."
Here.
Buy yourself a ticket to hell.

THE END
Compare good with evil and you'll see that, even though you hate you admit it, evil often wins
Money talks
The weak are always down trodden
And there are people who repay old scores for them.
Ladies and gentlemen, we bring you a popular puppet play troupe, led by Asanosusuke Konotake
It's their first show in Edo
It starts next month on the tenth
We'd greatly appreciate your attendance
Kitty!
Stop!
You all right?
Fool!
Don't be so harsh!
I was surprised
Nice cat
Don't touch!
What's that?
Is Asanosuke here?
Wait here
I feared you might still be here
Go to the merchants' party
I'm not involved
Don't say that
I'm an artist, not a geisha.
Goodbye
Hey, wait!
Spare me!
Forgive me!
Good morning
Nice day
MAGISTRATE'S OFFICE
What happened?
Nakamura
Good morning
What are you doing?
What's up?
A corpse was found again
It's the fourth
Their necks and hands were broken
They were all murdered brutally
They kill so easily.
It's bad
Who's the victim?
We don't know
You check on it
MUSICAL INSTRUMENT MAKER
Same as us?
The victims too were killers?
That's why no one reported it
The bodies were found by accident
More might be dead
It's the work of professionals
Why were they killed?
I don't know.
But one person did it all
Why?
Each of the bodies had a copper coin in its mouth
A coin?
Fare for the ferry to hell
A bad joke!
Are you going out?
Back already?
I think I'll take a trip
I'll be back in five days
Where are you going?
Never mind
A secret to me?
Are you angry?
Tell me
I know you think a lot.
You hardly sleep
Mother
Don't ask me anything now
Just tell Nakamura and the others to be careful
If what I suspect is true,
Something bad is taking place
From the liquor store?
I'm broke now
You'll do anything?
Yes
Anything at all?
If you pay
Do you know any killers?
Do you?
How should I?
You can't help me, huh?
Sorry
I have money
Ten in gold
Wait
Do you really have so much?
Sure?
All right, I'll help you
You mean it?
Relax.
Leave it to me
No thanks!
Hey, wait!
Making a hair ornament?
Yes
Looks nice
What brought her?
I don't know.
Who is she?
Her name is Okimi, a waitress but actually a whore
She lived with a man named Senta, but he's missing
That's why she came?
Probably.
Do your best
Listen, are you going to work?
About yesterday, it's okay
Really?
Sorry, but will you go first?
You'll get scolded
Be sure to come
Keep mingling with the crowd slowly
What for?
Want a killer, eh?
You may find one.
Now, go
Don't lie to us, or we'll kill you
Don't look for us
Just answer
Don't look around.
Keep walking
Who's to die?
Denji
Who is he?
My master
Why?
He killed
He killed brutally
Killed whom?
Something...
Someone I loved a lot
Where were you?
I looked all over
I came to leave money
Where?
Over there
Where?
Here
It's gone!
I left it just now
It's gone!
Good!
It means they accepted your request
Really?
Otherwise the money'd still be there
I'm glad.
Thank you
Goodbye
That hurts!
I'm sorry!
Don't yell!
Stop!
Don't do that!
Where were you hanging around?
You didn't come for two days
This is the only way
Go back to work, serve the customers
That hurts!
Stop!
Let go!
I won't take customers anymore!
Shut up!
Get ready!
Spoiled bitch!
So pain!
Don't be so rough
Some woman!
How many times must you make a fuss?
You don't want to get hurt, right?
Take a customer
No
Why so unreasonable?
Why?
Ask yourself
Who'd work for you?
You will
How else can you live so well?
How true!
Seems you understand
I must earn money
I spent all I had for something nice
Something nice?
Another man?
You'll know soon
Work hard
What?
The police?
Mister, why so hasty?
Sorry to keep you
May I be ofhelp?
Know a man named Senta?
Yes, but...
He isn't here?
Right
Why did he leave?
Why are you looking for him?
One ofhis relatives asked us to
He actually has relatives?
Tell us why he left
He up and left and never returned, that's all
But he hasn't resigned?
That's a problem
What do you mean?
He may be here.
Let me check
You can't do that!
I know yours isn't a common teahouse
Your girls are whores
Is that what brings you?
You should have told me sooner
Don't do it too openly, all right?
Thanks for warning me
Peeking again?
Lecher!
Omiyo!
Don't do that!
Miss Oko
Listen
We'll talk at Homyo Temple at midnight
Cooper
I've found you
I looked all over for you
Something wrong?
Look
Tell this to Masa
Sure.
See you again
Let's leave Edo
Staying, we'll get killed
You know, don't you?
Disobedient killers are brutally murdered
Stop it
We have friends.
They're all experts
Will get killed?
I doubt we'll get killed
That's the only way
Shinkichi
Midnight at the temple.
All right?
Don't die
I won't.
Don't say that
Why are you crying?
Because... if you die now... when nothing good has happened since we met...
Let's quit this work
It's too late
Stop crying
We're beginning a life-or-death job
Masa
Damn!
It's past midnight, huh?
Shinkichi!
Oko!
Why the locked doors?
Oko!
Are you in?
Sorry to bother you.
She out?
I think she's in.
She locked herselfin
Something wrong?
I'd like to know
How many days since?
Seven
Dammit!
Come quickly, whoever you are.
We'll get you
I'm tired of waiting
Let's eat
I haven't cooked
Then do it
No rice
Buy some
No money
What?
No work, no money
Tell me sooner.
We have to eat
Money?
Right.
I'll get some
Don't go out.
It's risky
Take it easy
Nothing happens in broad daylight
Come home soon
Keep the doors locked
Come back quickly
What did you learn?
Senta tried to be independent
He was recruiting whores
So Denji killed him?
I'm beginning to understand
Shall we start the job?
If so, when?
The sooner, the better
This evening?
Yes
Excuse me.
May we talk?
What do you want?
About Senta who's been missing
He's in Shinagawa
Is he alive?
In a way
Where in Shinagawa?
Pay me first
SHINAGAWA RED LIGHT DISTRICT
Senta!
Don't!
Lecher!
Work hard!
Enough!
A guest
A guest for me?
Thanks
Okimi said I was someone she loved?
It's so funny my stomach hurts
She never loved me
She doesn't care about me at all
Drinking tea?
May I drink your sake?
Thanks
It's good!
I see.
Masa's doing well
He and I somehow get along
We planned a secret trip
But his wife stopped him
Have you seen her?
That's why I'm staying here
What was the trip for?
Relaxation
I felt bad after Kitty died
A cat.
Okimi loved it
And Denji killed it
She clammed up, holding the dead cat
The sight sickened me
What was the cat like?
Just a stray
She found it and brought it home
Don't do that!
I'll kill you!
Let me ask you something:
I hear you asked them to kill Denji because he killed someone you loved
But I'm told he killed only a cat
Is that true?
Say it loud so they can hear!
What do you say?
Answer clearly
It's true
Really?
It's true?
You surprise me
You paid ten gold pieces just for a cat?
Did you hear?
What'll we do?
Here's their answer
You won't help me?
No
Why not?
This job is not for us
We'll take half the money for what we did
Wait!
Please don't go
Don't fool with us!
You're lucky you're alive
What's wrong with a cat?
Why must it be a man?
I don't care about men!
Listen, please!
To me, that cat was everything
I could even talk to it
And it always listened to me
It kept me going until now
Listen, if you're there!
Let's go
What's wrong?
Can you understand how she feels?
I can-very well
We're only a step from downtown, but I feel as if we were very far.
Nice, isn't it?
Son-in-law, I enjoyed the bath
You took a long time
You're very busy
Yet you took us on this excursion
I'm enjoying it fully
Ritsu, we'll come again next month
So take better care of me
Certainly
Do you think I've gained weight?
No.
Your skin looks fair
They use sea water for the bath here
It's good for young women's skin
Too bad, I'm an old woman
It sounds like you're boasting of this jaunt
People usually take their family to far places
We left this morning, and we're here before noon
The distance depends on how capable the family heads are
I can't go home so soon
Let me stay the night
As you please.
I'll take a bath
I spread my time for her, yet she only complains
Lousy battleaxe!
Nice bath, isn't it?
It sure is
Will you stay the night?
Do you have work tomorrow?
How do you know about me?
Will you stay?
Have we met before?
No.
But I know a lot about you
Your secret business too
You scare me
Who are you?
Oyo
I'm not asking your name
I'm asking what you do
Let me join you
We'll get along
What?
Dearest
Visit the festival
You'll see something interesting
Hello
There's no one else here.
Come
I wonder where he is
You?
!
Hey, buy me
Someone buy me.
A bargain
Buy me!
Buy me
You're drunk?
Damn!
Bastard!
Hey, someone buy me!
Buy me!
A bargain!
You're cute.
How much?
Free
Free?
Are you sure?
Will you do me a favor instead?
Sure.
For you I'd do anything
Avenge someone's death
Your parents'?
No, this one's
A dead cat!
Weakling!
Dammit!
It seems you're unlucky
Tell me about it
You bade it farewell?
Kitty
The funeral is over
We'll get Denji, right?
Yes.
Think its soul has been saved?
Of course.
It's gone to heaven
I'll go.
What about you?
I'll hold a wake
Wakes must be held before funerals
I see.
So no one ever taught you such things
What things?
Never mind
It's warm
Hold a wake for your cat.
Make it happy
See you again
Goodbye.
Thank you
I met a detective
I felt him strange and checked on him
Name?
Mondo Nakamura
Fellow killers?
I don't know yet
Master, it's not easy to uncover killers
By the way, what about the geisha and the buffoon?
We'll get them tomorrow
Tomorrow's a festival
Many will see us
Who's there?
Who was it?
Awoman
She must be a whore
Is that how you kill?
You'll die
I'm doing this for only five in gold
It's all you're worth
See anything?
No.
They've all gone out
Evidently.
How long must we stay here?
Carrying a portable shrine would refresh me
Thanks for your efforts
Nice day, huh?
Hello, officer
Here to see the festival?
Copper sent me a letter to come to the festival
Hide got one, too
So did I. Mine was from a woman
What's that?
Where's Oko?
Well, I don't really know
What's that?
Where's Zenko?
Yes, I wonder where he is
You saw?
Yes
They're good
I can't stand this!
What are you doing?
I'll carry the shrine
Don't go out!
Shut up!
Let me join you!
Turn it!
Masa!
Masa!
What happened?
He's alive
He's still alive!
Name:
Masa.
Occupation:
Tile maker
Name of wife:
Oyone
Guarantor:
Kyubei
Masa has been here since April 1835.
I'm back
Yuji, I'm here
Mother!
Something happen?
Come
Who's he?
Our co-worker
What?
We helped him yesterday
He started to talk
As you said, something terrible is happening
I know
You do?
Find anything?
As I feared, something terrible is taking place
I didn't do it!
Then he used a double, is that right?
There
You're it now
Right
Ready?
Not yet
You're alive?
Ready?
Not yet
I've been to Joshu
I checked what you did to us 15 years ago
You deceived us
You deceived even the police
Who was executed in your place?
Someone who didn't deserve life
Who decided that?
Are you ready?
Yes, we are
You taught me anything
Are you here?
You made me a man, too
I wonder where you are
Here?
Gosh!
That's why I left you live
Right now, get lost!
Someone's there, eh?
Quit right now, or leave Edo
If I refuse, you'll put a coin in my mouth, too?
Shall we settle it here?
There you are!
What are you waiting for?
Killing requires no logic
You kill for petty cash.
What'll be left of you?
Only a wrinkled face and a crooked spine
I'll do the job myself, understand?
What a man!
He's a monster
And I raised that monster
Yuji, get more hands
More hands?
Smart ones, or we'll all get killed
Okoyo, this is your show
Master!
I found one of the men you asked me to look for
What's he like?
He killed thirty-five by himself
Done.
Your left ear next
Is he the one who killed thirty-five by himself?
Gohei, the Woodpecker.
An expert
His weapon?
An earpick
That earpick has a needle
It works as a weapon
It stabs the brain through the ear
It brings sure death.
No misses
I don't think it makes much sense
What if many come at once?
Get one after another
No time for that
No good?
Fool!
Hey, this is a bird store, right?
Hello?
Excuse us
Is he out?
I hear he's a good assassin
His name is Hankichi
He uses wolfsbane
Powerful poison
What about it?
He applies the poison to a bird's beak and has it peck men
It may look like just another Java sparrow
But it's the best killer in Japan,
But it's the best killer in Japan, named Red Mt.
Fuji
It's dead!
Dead?
No substitutes?
Wait six months.
I'll train another one
Six months?
Where were you?
Masa!
You're alive?
I looked everywhere for you
Where were you, idiot?
Fool!
You mustn't go out alone
Ass!
Idiot!
That hurts!
Stop!
It hurts
Yes?
It seems Copper likes you
A policeman but actually a killer.
A duel hole
I like it, too.
I like you
He doesn't have to leave Edo
He should drop his men and work with me.
That's what he said
Why not do it?
Otherwise you'll die, as you saw
He said to kill one of your men, if you want to join
Don't try to kill me
If you do, you'll end up in a terrible way
Oh, it's Asanosuke!
He looks cute
Mother, I'll take this
Mondo is a killer
Mondo Nakamura is a killer
It's true.
Be careful
Mondo Nakamura is an assassin
Something wrong, Mother?
Nonsense!
What is?
Nothing.
Never mind
It's spring, the best time for vegetables
Bamboo, broad beans...
Broad beans are expensive
I like fried vegetables
Oil is expensive, too
Ritsu, serve him whatever food he likes
He's your husband, isn't he?
Have more rice
Ritsu
You startled me.
What is it?
About your husband, don't you think he's hiding something and is worried about it?
Worried?
My husband?
Don't you sense something unusual about him?
If anything, he's weak
Ordinarily he's strong in bed
I'm not asking that
I enjoyed the bath
Mother, why not take a bath, too?
What's wrong?
Welcome, madam!
Tanaka
Here to see Nakamura?
No.
Actually, I came to see you
Me?
About my son-in-law, is there anything odd about his character, or the way he works?
I don't think so.
He's his usual boring itself
Any problem at home?
Not at all
Nakamura, hurry!
Excuse me
Nakamura, your mother-in-law was here
That witch?
She asked odd questions about your work and character
It seems your family doesn't trust you
I'm ashamed
Mondo is an assassin
What's wrong?
Why did you scream?
Tell the police!
At this hour?
Just go!
Who's there?
That you?
What happened?
Some men were after me
They're after us!
Four of them
Where are you going?
To a gambling den.
I'm to met a good one there
Want to come?
You'll pay me back with interest.
Even!
Which one?
Not here.
He probably ran
We may have to give up recruiting
What a poor gambler!
You lack sense
Shut up!
What's wrong?
He was the one
He killed Denji
But he's a puppeteer.
He's popular now
No mistake.
I saw it myself
I accept your challenge
Even!
What do you want?
You're wrong to be after my money
I lost at gambling.
I'm broke
What I really want is your killing ability
Will you help us?
Want my help?
So you're the ones Copper is after?
You know?
Then help us
No.
I don't care what happens to anybody
You do.
I saw you kill Denji
So you were on the roof then?
Going to scatter confetti and kill us?
No thanks
Asanosuke, the puppeteer
Yuji, the musical instrument maker?
Officer, thanks for working for us
You're going leeward
That's no good for scattering confetti
Right.
But I go as luck requires
See you in hell
Oriku!
Who is it?
It's me, Tokijiro
I never heard of you
You will now
I hear you're looking for help
Don't do that!
The chain user, right?
Yes, I'm Tokijiro.
You scared me
He's a chain expert
You've changed
You still drink, don't you?
No, I quit drinking
Then show me your hands
If you drink, we can't use you
I don't drink.
I quit.
I'll do well
And I have a buddy who's very strong
We need money.
Hire us
Sorry to keep you
Let me demonstrate my ability
Liver crush!
He's great!
Usable, right?
Will you use us?
How much?
Twenty in gold
What do you think?
How long can you stay sober?
I don't think.
Really
For a few days
Afew days?
We'll use you
We'll lure out Copper.
Can you do that?
You watch
Cold tea, please
Have you made up your mind?
Yes.
Let me meet Copper.
Just say when and where
The sooner, the better
Got a gift'?
Kill your buddy
I'll do it later
Do it first, or he won't see you
Here you are.
What's on your mind?
You might stab him?
I haven't the guts
Then I'll be your guarantor, if you prove you'll work with me
How can I prove I'll work with you?
Do what men and women do
Mister, come on
Why be so nervous?
Have more sake
No thanks.
One cup is plenty
You're really somebody
When working and at home you pretend so well
That's why I love you so much
I'd like you to take a chance and be a real man
I showed you my proof as a man
How tiny it was!
When am I to meet Shobei?
Eight PM tomorrow at the shrine.
Is that all right?
It sank.
It's floating
Don't play with it
What's this?
Watch out!
It's decided
What is?
Eight PM tomorrow
Listening?
Will those bottles work?
Of course they will
Set fire to the cloth and toss them
The fire scatters
Sounds like a plaything
Let's eat
It's common to lay the same whore twice.
I called her again
And?
She jilted me.
What a pity!
Because you're ugly
What's that?
!
Lay off
Bring more sake!
Drink
I will.
Listen:
I thought it common to call the same whore twice
Why did she jilt me?
You're too persistent
What?
Say that again!
Drink
I will.
Listen:
It's common to call the same whore twice
So I called her again, but...
Shut up!
Don't do that!
What a shame!
It's ridiculous
One died, but we have another
No.
He ran away
With the money?
Yes
Why did you let him go?
Are you blaming us?
Stop it.
It's too late for that
What about tonight?
Hey, why look so miserable?
This means we must do it by ourselves
I don't want to die.
I'll quit
We kill people foe petty cash, but what'll we end up with?
Wrinkled faces and crooked spines
What that monster said may be true.
Times have changed
Nowadays they even kill their wives
What about our buddies who got killed?
I don't care
What?
Officer, you talk too much
And I don't hate Shobei
What about the earpick and bird men?
They got killed because we approached them
They were pros, prepared for death
Enough!
Your fighting means reached a conclusion
Yuji, the money
I thought we'd do it, so I prepared money for you
Now it's farewell money.
Take it
Good luck
I'm back
Why so early?
I'll go again.
The night shift
I'll wash up and eat
And I'll take a nap.
Fix my bed
I'm tired
Work, work, work...
Son-in-law!
Come here!
Did you see it?
I guess I'm old.
Real swords are too heavy
Too heavy?
Can you call yourself a samurai?
Nowadays samurai don't even draw them
They don't kill people
Bamboo swords are good enough
Shut up!
What a shame!
I thought you were a fearful man.
I was stupid!
What do you mean, fearful?
Never mind that
I was a fool
I think fearful men are also dependable
What's the matter?
I don't understand
Wait!
What are you doing?
We're married, so...
But not in the daytime
It's all right
It's new for me
Come on
Hurry!
Don't do that
He's an assassin?
So you come?
Let's go together
You smell of woman
How awful!
You slept with your wife, huh?
That means...
You're ready to fight, huh?
Are you using me as a decoy to fight?
How smart you are!
You wanted me to fight, right?
That's true.
But alone you're no match
You'll come, if I have to drag you
You can't.
I don't want to die
I'll leave you as well as Copper.
You're a man.
Fight by yourself
I'll go find another man
We set a trap to kill.
In the meantime, the sun sets
Sit on the railing of a bridge and look afar
All we can see is hardship.
Money talks
And the poor are always the ones who suffer.
Mondo, where are you going?
To the place we're going?
I thought I'd leave Edo
But I can't, because I have a family to support
You're lying
Well, it seems we aren't the only ones
There's another fool
What are you here for?
You all want to die?
Don't talk big.
I'm angry
Didn't you run?
Look after Hide's children
Take it
Careful!
They're brothels
Married to you, I couldn't go there
Win and live, and go there
Nakamura, did you come alone?
Another Shobei!
Masa!
Run!
No!
Run, I said!
It's them.
Go!
Let me handle them.
Run with her
Go!
No!
Go, I said!
No!
Masa!
Staying here, we'll get killed
How stupid you are!
No choice.
Let me help
Shobei, you never change
You still want to survive?
You left this!
We'll meet again when this cools off
Live!
Understand?
Don't die.
Good luck!
Careful!
First Unit, go there!
Second Unit, follow me!
I've found you!
Come!
Quick!
Move right.
How did you know I was here?
Junnosuke's iron ball gave me a hint
What is this?
A submarine.
The Shogunate got it from Holland
Is it a boat?
It's supposed to move forward, but...
Is it safe?
We might go down and never come up
Really?
Is that true?
Don't move
You decided to fight because you have this?
Smart man, Mondo!
Don't talk, it consumes air
Mother, he's so wonderful!
Asanosuke...
He's charming
He's fascinating
Excellent!
Superb player!
He's very good
He's perfect
I can't believe he has two faces
I wonder why he must gamble
Everyone has many secrets.
Remember that
Sorry to be late.
Your lunches
Too late.
The show is ending
You're spoiling the show
We'll eat later
Take them home
He's not popular.
He's poor too
But he's still good
And what are your parents' names?
Dad's name is Jurobei
Mom's name is Oyumi.
Surprised, Oyumi asked,
Your dad is Jurobei, your mom is Oyumi?
What are you doing?
Son-in law, it's hard to master an art, isn't it?
And I realize how excellent Asanosuke is
Enough!
Why must you two always be like this?
You jump at new things so easily
Now it's puppetry?
Son-in-law, it's all because you have no children
If you had any, we wouldn't need this
We promised not to talk about it, right?
Yes.
Mother, don't worry about us
This doesn't make sense without an audience.
Watch
Are you ready?
Wait a minute
And what are your parents'names?
April the thirteenth.
It supposedly was the unluckiest day of the year.
And it had to happen on that day, of all days.
Bloodshed!
Bloodshed!
Well...
Kohei Yasuda, an apprentice officer, suddenly went wild and attacked the magistrate, Kenmotsu Nagao.
Nagao had taken fifty in gold from Yasuda under the table in exchange for promoting him to detective.
But he broke the deal.
So, Yasuda got mad and went on the warpath.
I shouldn't say this, but Nagao's the one to blame.
The whole thing was just ridiculous.
And we're the ones who suffered.
It happened at lunchtime, a food and tea were all over the place.
What a mess!
In these times, life is even dear to us samurai.
Nobody wants to die for some crumb.
All we could do was run around.
But the worst was Tanaka, the inspector.
Get out of my way, Tanaka!
O-Open the door!
Open, open the door!
I'm in here!
I'm in here, you heard me!
You idiot!
Oh no!
Help!
Run!
You bastard!
No!
Die!
Wait!
Die!
No violence!
Open it!
Please!
Open up, it's me!
The magistrate!
M-May I open it, sir?
Stupid, the killer's in there!
Wait a little longer!
We'll help you out!
Hang on until then!
Be patient and wait!
W-Wait, Kohei!
I apologize!
You'll get your money and promotion, I promise!
Too late!
Step aside!
Aside!
You saw?
You saw?
I almost got killed, didn't I?
It was a great relief to be alive.
But I was wrong.
Something much worse was waiting to happen much worse.
The verdict... lt's unforgivable, Mondo Nakamura, acting cowardly during the crisis.
You shall suffer a reduction in pay to half for the next six months.
You shall be rebuked.
Sir, that's too much!
What?
Why must only I be punished?
What about the others who locked us up and didn't do anything?
Silence, Nakamura!
Don't talk back!
Being rebuked I could take.
But I can't survive that long on only half-pay...
Enough!
Case closed!
What is with your attitude, you idiot!
I know how you feel, but it's the Shogun's judgment.
You just accept it!
Accept it?
They tricked me.
Damn it!
What's all this?
What day do you think it is, dear?
The new magistrate's coming, it's an important day.
You're being penalized now.
Be the first to welcome him, it's a good chance to win his favor.
It's not that easy...
Don't argue, dear.
Neighbor Murata left an hour ago.
I guess he's smarter than my son-in-law.
All right.
You want me to leave early with my half-pay, whatever makes you happy.
Ritsu.
Where's my breakfast?
You get no breakfast.
What?
We decided that the day the new magistrate arrives we set our minds, we won't eat breakfast till you draw full pay again.
Please, go, now!
Lord Ukyonosuke Okuda, the new south magistrate, has arrived!
What a young magistrate!
He's a pet of Prime Minister Sakai.
I hear he used to be a page, look at his clothes!
Think he'll make it as a magistrate?
The food and wine are from the new magistrate.
Appreciate it.
Yes sir.
What a luxurious food!
Very expensive.
Young one tries to show off?
What?
What is it?
It's a gold coin!
A gold coin?
It's a gold coin!
I got one too!
In the soup!
is it real?
Real gold coin?
It's hot!
H-Hot!
Excuse me...
He's young but so thoughtful.
Anyway, let's wait for his toast.
All this fuss over one gold coin?
The magistrate's going to the castle.
You men stay and enjoy yourselves.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
You, what's your name?
Mondo Nakamura, sir.
So...
You're the one.
I've heard of you.
Huh?
Then I shall ask you now.
If something happens to me, don't forsake me.
Let's enjoy the dinner.
Oh yeah.
Let's go to that store.
This is a beautiful doll.
Wow, it's got a pretty face.
You guys ready?
The tragedy of poor Okiku.
She got a hairy corncob shoved deep inside her.
So poor Okiku drowned herself.
Ouch!
Hey, Nakamura!
Who are you singing about?
Better not be about Okiku, you should be praying for her soul.
What?
It wasn't an ordinary corncob, but the Shogun's.
She was humiliated and killed herself.
She had guts.
Try to act like her, okay?
Yes sir.
He's in a bad mood today.
I wonder what happened.
Who cares?
Well...
The hairy corncob sank deep...
Get that.
Yes.
He said, "don't forsake me"?
What a sense of humor!
Then what happened?
Nothing happened.
I felt rotten, so I came here to drink.
Give food to the paupers or something, it's on me.
Don't be ridiculous, giving away your money?
Can you afford it?
I know you're on half-pay.
Don't remind me, you're spoiling my sake.
It's true.
So...
Keep it for yourself.
Any news from your man?
No.
He went to look for a job two years ago and never came back.
You still call him your man?
Maybe you're right.
Why not flirt with me?
No.
Why not?
I don't want to flirt.
I want you to love me.
I'm serious.
You're lying.
Your face says...
You can't divorce your wife.
She'll kill you.
It's silly to be a man and a woman.
You think so?
They talk about what's flirting and what's love.
is that all they can do?
Oh my!
The food's burning!
Hey...
Sugie came home.
Sugie?
You know, that young samurai.
He went for a job interview.
I wonder how it went.
Tinkerer.
Yes?
I haven't seen you before, are you new around here?
Yes, today is my first day here.
May I help you?
Well...
Lend me your anvil and hammer.
I'll do it myself, it won't take a minute.
*
Why did you do that, Sugie?
Well... I want to forget that I'm a samurai.
That's why.
But what...
What happened to the job you mentioned?
I didn't get it.
This sword was a family treasure.
I tried to sell it to get money for someone who helped me.
Then I found out it's a fake.
But...
That made me decide to work as an umbrella maker.
And this is more useful for carving.
I feel sorry for Sugie.
Did he love that girl?
He'd planned to propose to her after he got the job.
But now he can't.
Get out our way!
Who are they?
Shogun's retainers, reckless samurai!
What is this?
It's a dead end.
What the hell, who brought us to this slum?
Kyuma!
Hey, what are you thinking bringing us to a dump like this?
I, Kyuma Kagazume will demonstrate my Megaki style leaping technique!
Next!
You, Koyata, do it!
Why not?
Here I go!
I'll go next, watch me!
Hold it!
Though poor, we have the right to live here.
There're old people and children too.
What if you injure someone?
Stop it!
What's that?
Hey, old man!
You, a samurai in some slum, dare criticize us, the Shogun's retainers?
You may be the Shogun's retainers, but you're still foolish!
What's that?
Step aside!
Look what you did!
Watch out!
No!
Father!
Father!
You all right?
Father!
You okay?
You all right?
Father!
What's wrong?
His neck is broken, ribs too.
What?
Murderer!
Murderer!
Murderer, murderer!
Get lost!
Murderer!
Give him back his life!
Give him back his life!
We didn't kill him.
The horse did.
The horse killed him, don't blame us.
Let's go.
W-W-Wait.
Stop!
Listen to me!
I know how you feel but don't make it worse.
Hey... lt's something you don't understand.
Huh?
Anybody know what happened to the horse?
It's over there!
This is... lt made the horse run.
But who did it, and why?
Nakamura.
Yes sir.
Your report states it wasn't just an accident.
You suspect treachery and wish to proceed with an investigation.
Yes.
I object.
Huh?
Your theory is absurd.
It's unfounded, I have to reject it.
Excuse me, but I have proof.
As I stated in there... I found the cross-shaped dagger in the horse's leg.
And what dagger are you talking about?
I submitted it with the report, sir.
I never received any such thing.
Huh?
I can't believe it.
I absolutely...
Did either of you receive it?
Huh?
N-No, sir, I didn't.
Neither did I.
What are you talking about?
I handed it to you.
I'm sorry, sir.
I was wrong.
I'm certain it was just an accident.
Good.
That's better.
May I ask you one thing?
What will happen to the Shogun's retainers?
I was informed that they're under household arrest.
No further punishment is required.
Case closed!
is Kyuzo here?
Yes, sir.
You left it at the scene.
It's not like you.
I'm sorry, sir.
That Mondo Nakamura is snooping around.
I don't think he's that sharp, but be careful.
Yes sir.
Oyumi, the soil...
Here you go.
I wonder who he was.
Huh?
The other guy who saved the kid.
What are you talking about?
You mean the old samurai wasn't the only one?
No.
I'm sure I saw him.
But did you see him?
I don't think so.
Me either.
Maybe you're mistaken...
You think so?
Why don't you ask the kid?
He doesn't live around here.
What?
Maybe he was just playing or just passing through, I'd never seen him before.
So the old samurai had to die trying to save a total stranger?
Boss, we're all here.
Please come out.
Yes.
Thanks for coming at this late hour.
I'll just get to the point.
We have three targets.
First...
Chikara Jinbo, the wild samurai leader.
Second...
Shinpachi Taro, his lieutenant.
Third...
Kyuma Kazazume, one of the gang.
They're the ones who caused the old samurai's death 10 days ago.
And about the fee... I've received three in gold up front.
I'm supposed to have three more later.
Total of six in gold.
What?
Only six in gold for three targets?
If it's Shogun's retainers, ten per head is even cheap.
Only six for three targets.
You've got to be kidding me.
Please don't go!
I know it's not enough, I know it's not but it's all I could raise.
Please!
Please!
Please, avenge my father!
My father...
Go inside, don't worry.
I'll take care of this.
She's from a common family.
Imagine...
How she slaved to raise even three.
Not only that...
What she must do to raise rest of the balance.
Will any of you be kind enough to accept?
Let's go, officer.
You guys go.
I'll stay.
You'll stay?
You'll accept so little?
Edo avengers, some people!
You call six in gold "little"?
What?
Hey, traveler.
What did you just say?
Sorry if I provoked you.
It's just the howling of a hungry stray dog.
Boss.
Let me take the three targets.
I'll be glad to do it.
Wait a minute.
Boss.
I'll accept too.
Officer!
I have a reason, just let me.
Okay...
Then you two can decide how to handle it.
You'll talk and split the targets or work every man for himself.
You'll be paid as you get the targets.
We're strangers.
So we'll work separately.
Just like "capture the flag."
That sounds good.
I'll get moving right now.
Yeah!
Yeah!
If you're going to fall in love you should do it like this.
Give him a hug and tease him a little.
Give him a kiss and tease him a little more.
But what you really should do is this and that and everything!
Everything!
He's got a tiny one!
Hear that?
Murderer?
What of it?
Bring it on!
I'll kill you all!
Who's next?
Kyuma, you all right?
Shut up!
I'm a murderer!
Are you listening to me?
All right, all right.
Hey, take him to bed.
What's wrong with you?
Let's sing!
...you should is this and that and everything!
Everything!
Coming through.
It's down the hall.
What do you want?
Well, I brought a gift from our master like we promised.
Let's see.
Thanks.
By the way, about the other day...
Was that what you wanted?
We didn't mean to kill the old samurai.
What did the magistrate say?
Well...
He might ask you to pull another job pretty soon.
Sounds interesting.
Fine.
Tell him we accept.
Another job...
What's going on?
Shh...
Who are you?
Dad!
Somebody help!
What happened?
What's going on?
You idiot, get out of my way!
It was a Shogun's retainer.
He was decapitated and lying in a pool of blood.
How disgraceful!
It's dishonor to the Shogun.
They should behave themselves.
What are they thinking?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
How long do we have to wait?
Who needs you?
We'll avenge Kyuma.
Let's go.
Yeah!
Out of my way!
You're lucky.
If it were a bit more serious you'd lose your job as officer and avenger.
Anyway, you failed to kill and got hurt.
What a smart samurai!
Leave me alone.
Don't be like that.
We're all worried about you.
It's not worth getting hurt with that low fee.
Hey, officer.
They're kids but they're still samurai.
And they're wild and hot-headed too!
You might not be alive next time.
I heard that the new magistrate is in on this.
I don't think you should be doing this alone.
Actually... I want to ask you guys a favor.
What favor?
About the new magistrate...
There is something fishy about him.
I want you to find out anything about him, will you?
Sure, by the way...
Have you changed your taste in women?
Eh?
Why?
She's been waiting outside.
What?
That brat!
What do you want?
Huh?
You know that I'm an officer, don't you?
Why are you following me?
l-l lost sight of my dad.
Don't lie to me.
What does your dad have to do with me?
Because you're both avengers!
You're after the same targets!
Keep it down!
That's why I thought if I followed you, I could meet him.
is that so?
I want to talk to him too.
Follow me.
Why are you afraid?
He's your brother, isn't he?
But... lf Dad is here too he'll scold me.
Why would he do that?
I don't know.
Weird family.
Thanks.
But you were careless.
Sis!
Dad, please let me stay with you.
I'll go crazy without you and Choji.
I can't live away from you.
Dad, I'm begging you!
I know I'm not that smart but you can tell me what to do.
I'll change as you like.
I'll do whatever you say!
So, please Dad!
What brings you here?
I...
Not you.
I'm asking the officer.
I'll wait until you guys finish your family stuff.
I'm finished now.
Dad!
Don't "Dad" me.
I'm not your father.
Dad!
Leave!
What do you want?
I heard about an odd avenger using his kids.
So you're the one, Bunshichi.
Just answer the question.
You may be an oddball but last night you went too far.
Go away if you're meaning your wound.
Just listen.
We're both avengers.
We kill for money.
No point in killing other avengers.
Let's make up and share the targets.
Everybody is happy and peaceful.
What are you talking about?
You were the one who wanted to work separately.
I know, but...
No, I'm not interested.
I know but...
No, I'm not interested.
Listen.
I'll kill anything gets in my way.
That's how I work.
Get lost!
Hey!
Jerk!
I told you to leave!
Go, go, go!
No!
Go, go, go!
Leave!
Dad, please, Dad!
Leave!
Dad!
Get lost!
You bastard!
Stupid Dad!
Stupid...
Damn you!
Oh well, that's why I don't want kids.
Hey, you, come inside.
Drop in.
Hey, you there with the bandana!
How about you?
Come on.
No thanks.
Come on.
Hey handsome.
Why not come inside?
Jerk!
Please.
Please, come in.
Please.
Oh, I beg you.
Please drop in...
What a gloomy voice!
Hey, you, come here!
I haven't seen you in a while!
Hey, you, come here!
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go!
You, come here!
I told you!
You have to look more cheerful to get men, you idiot!
I'm sorry.
Sorry isn't going to do!
I don't care if your father was a samurai.
But you have to follow my rules now!
Work hard or else, got it?
Yes, ma'am.
Then go get a sucker, hurry!
Hey, won't you please come in?
Eh?
Hey, won't you please come in?
Hey, won't you please come in?
Nah...
Hey, won't you please come in?
Please sir, please!
No thanks!
Please sir, please!
Please sir, please!
Hey you!
Please sir, please!
This is my spot.
Scram!
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Hey.
What's the matter?
Hey...
Please come in.
You drunk?
I sure am.
I'm drinking the best stuff I have.
That's great.
By the way...
Any messages for me?
No...
Okay.
Thanks.
Well then let me drink your best stuff, too.
No.
Why be difficult?
Why did you try to court me?
Huh?
You were flirting with me.
Sometimes women want men to be serious even if they know the men are just flirting.
That's how we are.
You're mean, Nakamura.
What's wrong?
What happened?
Tell me.
Will you?
You'll feel better.
A friend of mine was going to Osaka so I asked him to take my letter.
To your man?
Yes.
But he was gone.
Gone?
He quit his job six months ago.
No one knows where he is now.
Would you believe it?
I couldn't help it... I needed a drink.
Maybe this is how it should be.
I feel a little better.
As if a burden were removed.
Take me somewhere.
Anywhere...
For a few days...
The mountains, the sea, anywhere.
Will you take me?
Please.
Sure, Ofuku.
I have to take care of something first.
But I'll take you somewhere.
The shining sea might be good for you.
How about some island?
Well, I've got to go now.
I'm serious.
I promise.
Don't do anything stupid.
Sorry to keep you.
Anything new?
That young magistrate was promoted by Prime Minister Sakai.
Sakai brought him to the castle as a page.
Since then he's moved up amazingly fast.
And finally he became a magistrate.
But no one knows his history.
Was he a temple page?
Yeah, but I don't know which temple.
Some say he's a nobleman's son from Kyoto.
But others say he once was a prostitute.
A male prostitute?
Officer.
What sort of business are you into?
If that fishy guy is in on this, I don't want any part of it.
If something happens to you they're going find out about us, too.
I know.
A prostitute, huh?
Sounds likely.
Hey.
Officer.
Judging from what you told me, he must be Kyonosuke.
The age and the looks match too.
I've been in this business for a long time, but... I don't think I've ever seen a guy as beautiful as him.
He had such soft and fair skin, damn it!
Officer.
To be honest, I'm still in love with him.
How long did he work here?
Well...
For a few years.
He was a fortunate boy.
With that face...
He became a Kabuki actor after Haginosuke ended up like that.
Hey hey, hold on.
...after Haginosuke ended up like that.
Hey hey, hold on.
Who is Haginosuke?
His rival.
One of them was supposed to be an actor but he committed a double suicide with a customer.
Oh?
Just before his big break?
Exactly sir.
It wasn't even somebody he was seeing...
He and his guest poisoned themselves the first night they met.
It was very strange.
Poisoned themselves?
Well, anyway because he died, Kyonosuke could leave this place.
I remember Kyonosuke.
He was a ham, but he looked beautiful on the stage.
Unlike this shack, it was a real theater downtown.
A real fancy one.
I still remember.
When Kyonosuke posed like this, the audience went wild!
It was certainly amazing.
Then, Enkoin Temple offered him a job as page.
Enkoin, the temple?
Yup.
A high-class temple where ladies-in-waiting go.
We were surprised when we heard that they'd invited him in there.
How did it happen?
I don't know well.
But I heard it was arranged by Lord Sakai, the temple magistrate then.
You mean the Prime Minister Sakai?
Yes.
But there was one problem.
The troupe leader refused to release Kyonosuke.
That's understandable.
He liked him very much.
But he gave in after all?
No choice, he died.
Died?
Was he poisoned?
I heard he was killed by a robber.
But no one was prosecuted so I don't know who did it.
Anyway...
Kyonosuke moved into the temple.
Rumor has it he became the Shogun's page later on.
The troupe leader's death was timely.
Over there.
Yes sir.
Thanks.
Here's a tip for you.
Thank you very much.
Big party tonight, eh?
For whom?
For Lady Matsuo, from the Shogunate.
is that so?
Then, whose palanquin is that?
It belongs to Prime Minister Sakai, and his servants are here too.
is he here, too?
Yes.
They came to pray for the Shogun's recovery.
Oh?
Thank you.
The Shogun's recovery?
is he ill?
I hadn't heard about it...
Sorry I'm late.
Hurry!
Let me take his pulse.
Okiku...
Okiku...
Be brave, Shogun!
Okiku...
Pour for him.
Yes.
Come to think of it, it was a while ago...
The Shogun was well when he had this made.
He'd come here almost every day to entertain himself.
I heard that he enjoyed it especially with Okiku.
Yes.
Take a gook look!
In no way am I inferior to young pages!
That's what he used to say.
He would go into that room.
There he laid his hands on Okiku, the maidservant.
Hey, hey, hey.
No, please!
Please stop!
Please stop!
Please...
Please don't do this!
Please don't...
Come on.
Anyway I'm surprised you knew about it.
The Shogun had recurring nightmares saying "Okiku, Okiku forgive me!" in his sleep.
No one really figured out that it was about that maidservant, but...
How could you know?
We'll talk about it some other day.
Meanwhile...
Let's enjoy the climax.
Women's pleasure lasts till they turn into ashes.
How fortunate they are!
Prayers won't work.
To save the Shogun from his nightmares to remove the thorn, Okiku, from his mind your plan will be the best.
But he's very old.
We must hurry.
Yes.
I understand, sir.
Okiku rests in peace at the age of 19.
The tragedy of poor Okiku...
So, it wasn't just a song.
But what's the connection to the tenement houses in the village?
Him, why is he here?
Who's there?
Come out!
Or shall I come to you?
Mondo Nakamura.
I heard you were a lazy officer.
But I guess you're a hard worker.
Remember this...
Whatever you do, my position will not be affected.
Let me know when you change your mind and decide to work for me.
Since you're working hard, I can even have you promoted.
He's onto us now.
What'll we do?
We'll do it.
Have we a choice?
Shinpachi, what's keeping you?
Come on!
Hey, don't leave me alone.
Wait!
A top's spinning...
Ouch...
A top's spinning...
Dad!
Shinpachi!
Hey, what happened?
Who's there?
Wait!
Wait!
Run!
Wait!
Wait!
Hey, you, stop!
Hey, wait!
Shinpachi!
Shinpachi!
Stop there!
Wait!
Which way did he go?
Right or left?
Let's split!
Okay, I'll go this way.
We have to avenge Shinpachi, don't miss him!
Okay, put him down.
Shinpachi, Shinpachi, Shinpachi!
Damn!
Look!
What is it?
Are you blind?
This thickness and this radiance... lt's not a normal knife.
It's made from a sword.
A sword?
A sword that belonged to a samurai.
Find out who did it.
Shinpachi, don't worry.
I'll avenge your death.
Me too.
I promise, Shinpachi!
Shinpachi!
Shinpachi!
Shinpachi!
It's soaking.
We must take it apart and wash it.
But it's a brand new kimono.
A kimono's life depends on who wears it.
Poor kimono!
What were you doing to get so wet?
Working.
I know you were working, I'm asking what kind of work it was.
Watching a dangerous criminal.
With whom?
Nobody.
What happened to the criminal?
He died.
He died?
He was murdered.
Oh, you actually did such manly work?
Mother, Mother!
My husband was alone and... I heard.
Use an umbrella next time you watch out murders.
What's that?
Maybe it's the dead man's friend here to get you.
Son-in-Law!
Take it easy.
Who is it?
Be careful, my dear.
You're...
My dad...
What?
Please help my dad.
Hey!
Who's the kid?
He's sick.
Sick?
Yes.
He has a fever, bring him in!
Yes.
No.
Yes.
Mother!
I want to make sure one thing first.
Son-in-Law, don't tell me he's your son.
Oh please, he has a father.
Are you sure?
Oh please, he has a father.
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
I'm serious!
I'm serious!
Fine, Ritsu, boil water.
Take him inside, son-in-law.
Don't hold him that way.
Keep his head higher.
How clumsy, hurry!
Dad, be brave!
Don't die, Dad!
Your brother asked me to come.
What happened?
I don't know.
When I got here, he'd been already injured.
I found this in his shoulder.
It's poisoned.
Dirty trick!
He came to.
You all right, Dad, be brave!
Dad!
It's me, Dad.
Why are you here?
Dad...
Leave...
But...
Get out!
Choji.
Who are you?
Relax, will you?
It's me.
It's you.
I'm keeping your kid.
Why do I have to take care of your kid?
Poor kid, he was drenched.
Why do you have to use your kids for killing?
I don't understand.
He's your own son, for god's sake.
No, he isn't.
I bought these two kids.
Bought them?
Yeah, so what?
If I hadn't, neither of them would have lived.
Their poor parents would've killed them.
Even so, they are still kids... I'm just teaching them how to live.
I was also bought the moment I was born.
My foster father was an avenger, that's how it was.
I learned how to crush a man's face with my top.
The smell of blood, rolling human heads...
Yeah, I got used to such things.
It's like a merchant's son who learns accounting.
What?
Why so quiet, well, that's what happened.
If you're a real avenger don't look so glum.
Thanks for Choji.
You can leave now.
What now?
Meaning?
I guess she didn't mind the poison.
What do you mean?
She sucked it out.
You'll recover soon.
Maybe you bought her, but you should be nice to her.
She's no longer a kid.
She's a woman.
It happened about a month ago.
Dad.
What?
We did it a good job, didn't we?
Yeah.
You said I couldn't do it, but I did it, didn't I?
Sure.
You surprised me.
I'm glad to hear.
Saucy!
Shut up!
What's wrong?
We have to get up early tomorrow.
Omitsu.
What's the matter?
I've stayed away from her since.
I can use kids, but not a woman.
Women are too soft for this life-or-death racket.
I didn't know...
Sorry I made you talk.
Lousy work we have, huh?
Don't worry about your kid.
Oh, you're awake?
Your fever's down.
Good.
Your dad will be fine in a few days.
But don't tell anyone about our secret work.
Especially not my wife and mother-in-law.
Understand?
Good.
It's time for breakfast.
Ritsu.
That child looks that he's good enough to be a samurai's son.
Exactly, Mother.
I don't want to say this but he looks better than my son-in-law.
I wish we could adopt him as our successor.
Mother?
You get a divorce from your husband right away.
Then we can have another chance in life.
But that's going too far.
Ritsu, you can't stay young forever.
You must remarry while you can.
Now is the time to make up your mind.
Mother.
Actually I've been thinking about the same thing.
Isn't it too much, you two?
My dear.
Oh, son-in-Law.
My dear.
Don't forget, I'm a man, too.
There are women who'll love me.
Who would want to stay here?
Thanks a lot, good-bye!
Where are you going?
Don't worry.
Where are you going?
He'll come back.
Think so?
Of course, he always does.
Think so?
Of course, he always does.
I really wish he were dead!
Nakamura!
Oh, what happened?
I want to talk to you about my man, he's coming back!
What?
He wrote to me!
He opened a shop somewhere and he's coming to pick me up.
Would you believe it?
After making me worry so much, he's so selfish.
Don't you think so?
What'll I do?
What do you mean?
I'm scared.
Scared?
is it all right that only I'll be happy?
I'm scared.
The gods may punish me.
Nonsense!
No gods will punish you.
Pray with me!
We can't go on a trip now.
Sorry.
Thank you.
I'll never forget you.
It's him that time.
Mr. Tinker!
You're the one who saved that child.
When the horse went wild, you and Hirano saved the kid.
I don't think so.
You're mistaken.
You don't need to hide it.
Unfortunately, Hirano broke his neck and died.
I've been wondering who the other man was.
I'm glad to find out.
I'll tell everyone about you, they'll give you more work.
You deserve it.
You're a hero.
Stay here.
Shogun's retainers!
They're here again!
Run for it!
They're here again!
What?
What do you want?
Get lost, murderer!
Get lost!
Whose dagger is this?
Mine.
It's been missing.
So, it's you!
If it's yours, you're the one who killed Shinpachi!
What?
Killed him?
You killed the old samurai, Hirano!
Yeah!
What, are you challenging us?
Sounds like fun.
We came to fight.
Let's do it.
Charge!
Dear!
What are you doing?
No one here?
I wonder what's going on.
Mr. Nakamura, what are you doing here?
Why do you care?
Can' t l sip tea?
It's no time for tea!
The Shogun's retainers again.
There're a lot of people injured and dead, all the officers went to the village.
Really?
Nakamura!
You're late.
Mr. Nakamura!
Ofuku!
Ofuku!
It's me, Nakamura, do you recognize me?
Your luck is returning.
Don't die.
I told you, the gods will punish me.
Ofuku!
Let me go!
Let go of me!
Give it up!
Listen, we only avenged our friends' deaths.
Why must we die?
Stop!
Fools!
Let me speak.
Magistrate Okuda started all this!
Kill them!
Out of my way!
What are you doing?
Damn it!
Why do we have to be evicted?
What did we do wrong?
Kick them out!
Hey, get moving!
Hurry!
Shut up!
Snap it up!
Walk!
Hurry, keep moving!
Move!
I said hurry!
Keep walking.
Officer, can we talk?
She ruined the quilts and bedding.
What a shame!
It's a mess!
Stupid tramp!
Scatter purifying salt!
Yes.
It was this morning.
She stabbed her heart with a kitchen knife.
No last words.
But I hear the balance, three in gold, went to the boss.
When she sold herself to raise the money, she'd already made up her mind.
It must've been hard for her every night.
She put up with it to avenge her father.
She didn't intend to live.
Excuse us.
Excuse us.
Who are you?
You want to bury her by yourselves?
Yeah.
She was our acquaintance.
We don't mind, less work for us.
Sounds good.
Okay.
Revenge is avenger's work.
If the targets are killed by the Shogunate, it's not revenge.
Oyumi's soul will never rest in peace.
You shouldn't have accepted it if you can't do the job.
The three in gold she gave her life for.
What'll we do about it?
Will you keep it until I finish?
What do you mean?
Like you said, her soul can't rest in peace.
But it's not for the same reason as yours.
But because the real killer is still alive.
What?
You're not lying, are you?
I saw what happened.
It looked like the horse kicked the old samurai.
It was a trick.
A guy who pretended to save the kid jumped in and broke the old samurai's neck.
Why didn't you say sooner?
My job was to get rid of the targets for the clients.
But it's different now.
I wouldn't care if she were alive but I can't lie to somebody who's dead.
I'll kill the real murderer and come for the balance.
Wait.
You talking about the guy who uses cross-shaped daggers?
Yes.
Then, there's someone who's behind him, right?
If you know why ask me?
Mother.
Ritsu, did you find him?
He's nowhere around.
I wonder where he is.
He's nowhere around.
I wonder where he is.
I wonder where he is.
Where could he have gone?
What's wrong?
Dear!
Son-in-law!
Dear!
That boy is gone.
While Ritsu and I were in the kitchen...
He disappeared?
Yes, like the wind.
Did you see a man around?
A man with a black hat and a cape?
I don't think so.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
I heard a noise and looked into the garden.
A noise?
Not a noise, more like...
Maybe a whistle.
I heard the whistle and I left the room for a second then...
Where are you going?
...I left the room for a second then...
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Son-in-law!
Sis!
Stay here.
Dad never loses.
Dad!
Dad!
Choji, stay here, don't move.
Okay?
Sis!
Dad!
Cry!
Yell!
Call for help!
Cry or I'll kill you.
Dad, don't come!
Dad!
Run!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Don't die, please!
Dad...
Don't die, please!
I won't die.
I'm all right, help me up.
We made it again, right?
Maybe because Omitsu came back we three could make it.
Dad.
What's wrong, be brave!
I still have one target left.
After I talked so big to the boss...
Do it for me.
I will, don't worry.
Omitsu...
Choji... I'm going to take a nap for a while.
I'll wake up soon.
Then we'll go on another trip, the three of us.
Does it hurt, Dad?
Not really.
Like this, I feel so warm and nice.
I really feel great.
It's too good for an avenger like me.
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Officer... lt's against the rules to do it for free.
Not free.
I'll do it too.
We shouldn't work without pay.
But doing nothing is worse.
We'll do it for his kids.
Let's go.
We don't know how numerous the enemy is, don't use the one-shot weapon.
We haven't got anything else.
Don't worry, I sell weapons in my store too.
What are these?
Grenades from Holland, don't pull the pins before tossing them.
I'll use these, let's go.
Magistrate, you're a fearful man.
You agitated those retainers and the paupers and you cleared that slum in only ten days.
It's hard to believe.
The Shogun is delighted.
He plans to build a temple there and dedicate it to Okiku.
I'm still amazed how pleased he is.
It seems like you can read his mind.
A man so thoughtful will be a perfect majordomo for the Shogun.
I greatly appreciate your recommendation, sir.
It was a short time, but the post of magistrate didn't suit me.
Maybe the job was too rough for a delicate man like you.
Anyway, let's have a drink.
Come closer.
Actually I'd rather explain why I wanted to know about the Shogun and Okiku.
Oh, I'd like to hear.
Speak.
I'm the younger brother of Okiku who was violated by the Shogun and killed herself.
What?
is that true?
Yes, sir.
Then, why did you do all this?
The Shogun is the man who killed your sister.
Why be so loyal to him?
Guess why.
Don't tease me!
I don't know what you're really thinking.
My sister's death taught me one thing...
Death is defeat.
So...
So?
You...
Why?
Now you know.
You've lost to me.
Just like the Shogun destroyed my sister.
What?
Then, do you intend to kill the Shogun for revenge?
You still don't get it?
I just use him to get us promoted.
Why would I want to bother him?
I've made it, so I don't need you anymore or should I say you're in the way.
Thank you for everything though.
Why you...
Give up already.
We'll tell people that you had a stroke.
Your family won't be disgraced.
Die like a man.
Die, die, die, die, die, die...
At last.
What took you so long?
How many corpses do you have to leave behind?
Aren't you so cool?
These guys told me that you're one of the avengers, right?
Good, do your job!
Try for my head!
Intruders, come, everyone!
Hurry!
Hey you!
Damn it!
What's going on here?
Nothing serious.
Calm down.
B-But... I said, calm down!
He's gone mad!
Hey you, come back here!
Come and get me!
Come on!
I still have my head.
Not bad.
You think that stump can reach my neck?
That's not fair...
Listen to the tragedy of poor Okiku...
Here.
Spend it in hell.
Mom?
Knock, knock.
Oh, it is too early for "Knock, knock." Now, come on, eat up.
We're running late.
Chris, give me a break!
Does it have to be World War II this morning?
World War III.
Cute, kid.
8:30, Cal!
- Why didn't you tell me it was so late?
- I just did.
- Dad?
- What?
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?
- Dwayne.
- Dwayne who?
Dwayne the bathtub, I'm dwowning!
That's terrible!
That's not my lunch, is it?
Well, not now, it isn't.
- When did your friends leave this morning?
- Oh, I thought they were your friends.
Well, they left about 3:00.
You used to be able to go all night.
Yeah, I know, but I can't do it anymore.
What can't you do anymore?
Eat your breakfast.
Do you think they would have taken the hint if I had served the last drink in my pajamas?
Come on, kiddo.
Shoes and socks on.
Let's go.
Come on.
Oh, shit.
Oh, great.
- Terrific, Cal.
- I got it.
No, no, not the socks!
- Hit the showers.
- Right.
Mom?
What?
Coffee machine.
Oh, perfect!
Mom.
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Dad, help!
Dad!
What is it?
What is...
Oh, Jesus!
- Mom!
Dad!
- Lisa, no!
Oh, my God, no!
Chris, don't touch her!
Don't touch her!
Mom!
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Mom!
- Dad!
- Oh, my God!
Christ!
Chris, Chris.
Por favor, don't break nothing!
And be careful from the walls.
Mrs. Hallidayjust painted them.
Follow me, okay?
You did what anyone would have done.
It happened so fast.
I just reacted.
He was trying to help.
Christ, the man's got four kids!
Don't you think you'll be more effective when you do go back out there, if you begin to forgive yourself?
That's what this is all about, Frank.
That's how I can help you, if you'll let me.
Yeah.
Yeah, I want to.
It's...
I do.
It's, uh...
Good.
Well, I'd say we made a pretty good beginning, wouldn't you?
Yeah.
I'll set you up for next week, then.
What have you got there, little guy?
- Chief Black Cloud.
- Yeah?
Are you sick?
I'm sorry.
- You can call me anytime.
- Right.
See you next Thursday.
Hopefully we'll be a little better settled in by then.
- Thank you, Doctor.
- You're welcome.
- Are you all right, Bean?
- Mmm-hmm.
Not so fast, my friend.
From now on, I don't think it's a good idea for you to play in here while Dad's working.
Is it a deal?
Okay.
What do we got here?
Flowers.
Mrs. Ruiz and I are gonna plant some for Mom.
Like these?
Mom wants me to.
Do you believe me?
I believe she would want you to.
Sure.
Take it easy, you guys.
I just finished painting this place.
Oh, wait a moment.
No!
My wall!
My beautiful wall!
I finished this whole wall with my own hands and now it looks like my first apartment.
- Well, it's just a little gouge.
- It's a giant crater!
I'm gonna have to start from scratch!
Fill it, sand it!
All right, all right.
What's the problem?
This.
Now, 10 years ago, I wouldn't have minded.
But now I want a wall to look like a wall.
You know what I mean?
I'm nearly finished.
Let me take a look at it.
- Oh, no, no, no.
You don't have to do that.
- It's okay.
I'm taking care of it.
Well, thank you very much.
That's great.
Who says chivalry is dead?
Alive and well in New York.
Amazing.
So, how does it feel to have your whole life stuffed in little boxes?
A little cramped.
Yeah.
Now, here's the number for the electrician.
He's expecting your call.
Painter's coming on Sunday, and I'll get to the kitchen faucet as soon as I can.
You gonna fix it yourself?
Sure.
I'm the landlady.
Hey, listen, I lost one of my earrings.
I think it might be in your apartment.
It's pretty hard to miss.
Then, it might be in my bag.
But if you see it, will you let me know?
I'll keep an eye out.
- Great.
How is Carmen working out?
- Just fine, thank you.
She's terrific with Chris.
Oh, shit!
The stream of cops through here is going to do wonders for my parking ticket situation.
Maybe I can put in a word for you downtown.
Listen, if there's anything else you need, I'm right across the street.
Hey, Officer?
Uh, listen, honey.
Have you started writing that thing out yet?
Hey, come on, I want the ball.
Look out!
Whoa.
- The ball is in the clear.
He scores!
- Dad, wait!
Wait for me!
Marty Wertheimer, please.
- Who's calling?
- It's Cal Jamison.
- Can you hold?
- Yes, I'll hold.
MARTY'.
I told you never to call me here.
What do you want?
I'm a busy man.
Hi, buddy, how are you?
Great, great.
So, is that a great apartment or what, huh?
That I found for you all by myself?
And how about the landlady?
Not bad, huh?
Do you know what I had to do to get that?
Huh?
So, uh, by the way, where's my commission?
Hey, shut up already.
You done great.
It's wonderful.
No complaints.
- So where are you?
You're 15 minutes late.
- I'm in the park.
The park?
What are you doing in the park?
You're supposed to be here.
I'm on my way.
I've got Chris with me.
Oh, great, great.
- It's okay if I bring him?
- Oh, yeah, please.
Uh, okay.
See you soon, Marty.
Chris!
Chris!
Chris?
This is unusual for Central Park.
What are you doing down here?
What do you mean, what am I doing?
I'm jogging.
I run here every day.
- Did you see anyone else here?
- No, no one else was here.
Just me.
- Is this all you saw?
- What?
That's all I saw...
Please, calm down, Miss.
What were you doing here?
What am I doing down...
I run here every day.
My girlfriend and I usually run.
Today, she had to go to the dentist.
I just want to take a bit of information from you, please.
Information?
- I need a little information.
- What kind of information?
- Like your name first, please.
- Oh, my name?
- Yes.
- My name is Muriel Greenburg.
Do you spell Greenburg G-R-E-E-N-B-E-R-G?
No.
B-U-R-G.
Greenburg.
Miss, this is in case I have more information later on.
- Okay, what's your address?
- Chris!
Sorry.
What apartment is that?
Come on, honey.
Okay, folks, the show is over!
Come on, it's a beautiful day,
I'm sure you can find something else better to do than look at this garbage.
Come on, start moving.
Come on, get out of here!
Let's go!
I said keep moving.
Let's go...
That's it.
Keep going.
All right, just keep going away.
That's it.
Dad, do you believe in God?
I believe in a god.
What you got there?
May I?
- Where'd you get this?
- Foundit
- Where?
- In the park.
Where in the park?
Somewhere.
It's a wishing shell.
How do you know that?
I just do.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where is this guy?
Hey, there he is.
- Hi, Marty.
- Hey, Chris, how are you doing?
I've been waiting all morning for you, you know that?
- How are you, Marty?
- Who's this bum you're dragging around?
You know, you gotta watch these guys that hang out in the park.
- What's this?
- What?
Bubble gum?
Didn't your dad ever show you where to park your gum?
- Where?
- On the bedpost, for crying out loud.
Look, you got any questions about important stuff like this, you come ask your lawyer.
All right?
- Okay.
- Okay.
I ever show you this one?
Twice.
Okay, wise guy, you get them apart.
I'll bring him right back.
Promise.
Linda.
- Coffee?
- No.
One.
Regular.
Thanks.
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.
We're in agreement, right?
So...
So, what's the problem?
I don't have any problem with the idea of a lawsuit, Marty.
The point is I don't want Chris to have to relive it all.
Neither do I.
But that coffee machine was fuckin' defective and we gotta nail the bastards so no one else gets killed.
So long as Chris doesn't have to testify.
I mean it, Marty.
- I feel very strongly about this.
- You and me both.
Look, this will not go to trial.
I promise you.
They'd be crazy.
They'll settle.
Do you smoke?
No, thanks, I quit.
Yeah, me, too.
I quit at least twice this week already.
Thanks.
I love Chris, you know that.
He's a great kid.
Tell you the truth, he's not the one I'm worried about.
- I'm all right.
- That's it? "I'm all right"?
You spend your time listening to these cops' problems, you can't even talk about your own?
It's lonely.
Yeah?
I'm trying to pick up the pieces.
Yeah.
It really feels strange being back.
Oh, the city's changed a lot.
Yeah, some days I'm not so sure it was a good idea to bring Chris here.
But in a funny way, it's brought us closer together.
If you need anything, anything at all, I'm there before you hang up the phone.
- You know that.
- I know.
- I feel better.
You feel better?
- I feel better.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Uh, uh, Linda?
You want to send in Mr. Jamison, Esquire, please?
What is this?
My 11:00 number.
Come on in, kid.
Sit down.
Get a load of this.
Don't run on the stairs.
Cheating!
No, no, no, no!
Iwin.
Cheater.
Hi, Carmen.
Any calls?
No calls.
But this come for you.
Hey.
From where?
It's a housewarming present from Mrs. Halliday.
Oh.
- She make it herself, for you.
- Wasn't that nice?
It's very beautiful, sf?
Ah, Si.
Stunning.
Are there any more of these perishables, ma'am?
No, this is only dry stuff and spices.
Okay, and did you buy this here, the radio?
This is from London.
I'm just gonna have to take this apart.
I'll put it back for you.
WOMAN'.
Arriving passengers who have cleared customs, please place your luggage on the conveyor belt...
Can I see that?
Open this, please.
Just personal items.
No need to look in there.
All right.
Do you remember this bowl?
That little Indian boy made it.
- Yeah, we have one just like it.
- Oh, you do?
I love the things he made.
Vino?
Vino?
Where's the vino?
- ...and cilantro.
- How's it going?
Mmm!
Mmm!
Ambrosia.
- Ambrosia!
- Here, here, taste.
Taste.
Well?
What do you think?
Don't be bashful.
- I'm inured to criticism.
- Hot.
Oh, nonsense.
Good for you.
Therapeutic, anti-depressant.
Mmm.
- News to me.
- I stand before you, living proof.
You put the NYPD on gumbo twice a week, and you're out of business.
Why don't you give that a good stir and then we'll bring in the rice, huh?
That's a useless knife.
Useless knife.
I'll have to get another.
It's lovely.
Who gave it to you?
I found it.
Really?
Here.
Show it to Dennis.
Dennis, look.
- What's this?
- My shell.
Oh.
- It's your shell, is it?
- Yep.
You seem pretty sure about that.
Yep.
It's a beautiful piece of work.
Have you seen this, Kate?
Yes.
You still got that thing, Chris?
That's his wishing shell.
Now...
What do you suppose you could make out of this?
I don't know.
What about a necklace?
That's the day we went to Osage.
The reservation.
Remember that?
- Remember that, Chris?
- Yeah, and the day I got Chief Black Cloud.
That's right.
And Dennis bought me the arrowheads.
God.
Got a memory like an elephant.
Oh, look.
- There's Mom.
- Mmm.
Ah, she looked so pretty.
Well, that was a very happy day, wasn't it?
My prize pupil.
- In anthropology?
- Mmm.
I always thought one day, she'd be teaching me.
Oh, look at that face.
Oh, that was the day we went to visit the Ojibwa.
Remember, Chris?
- Oh, yeah.
- About 40 degrees below zero.
They had fires inside the tent.
It must have been 70 degrees below, with the wind chill.
It was quite a day, wasn't it?
How do they stay warm...
I'm sorry.
I remember taking those pictures.
That was the last time we were all together.
Oh, my, my, my.
MY-
How does Chris seem to you?
Does he seem all right?
- He's a remarkable little boy.
- I think he's doing all right, actually.
Thanks, Kate.
Come on.
Come on.
The kitchen all fixed up, Dr. Jamison.
Thank you, Carmen.
You gotta stay back here!
- I'm sorry, miss.
You can't get...
- Can I get through?
- Where is he?
- He's inside.
- Lopez call this in?
- Yeah.
He did.
Where is he?
He's up behind the screen.
We can't get near him.
Keeps asking for you.
- What do you got?
- We got a dead kid.
I want you to understand that!
Can you tell how old he is?
Jesus, he only looks to be about 9 years old.
He's only a kid.
There's so much blood.
Look at those ashes.
They go completely around where the body was.
It looks like a Cult.
Jesus Christ almighty.
Just get McTaggert here, that's all.
Just don't you come any closer, all right?
Don't come any closer!
Just don't do it.
Just quit fuckin' around with me!
Nobody's fucking around with you, Tom.
Did you call this in?
- I called it in, Lieutenant, yes.
- What's the problem?
Jesus Christ, did you see what they did to that kid in there?
- Did you see?
- Yeah.
I saw.
What do you know about it?
- They took my badge.
- Who took your badge?
Who took it?
Who took it, Tom?
Come on, now.
- You don't know what they could do to me.
- Tom, come on.
You did a good job on this one, now we're on top of it.
You gotta let us have it.
We're gonna go down to the station house and we're gonna make a report.
No!
You can't stop them.
You can't do anything.
You don't understand anything.
Come on.
Come on, Tom.
It doesn't work!
I'll be safe.
- Get the gun!
- All right, hold him down!
Get him the hell out of here, fast!
Why did you stop me?
We can't do anything!
Oh, McTaggert.
Get it straight!
They know who I am!
Let go!
I'm a cop, too!
God damn you!
McTaggert!
McTaggert!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
- I'm here, Chris!
- Dad!
- It's all right, honey, I'm here.
It's okay.
- Dad!
It's all right, sweetheart.
Here, it's all right.
It's just a bad dream.
It's just a bad dream.
It's all right, baby.
It's all right, baby.
It's all right.
Dad...
- Hello?
- Is this Dr. Jamison?
Speaking.
Good.
This is Lieutenant McTaggert, 27th Precinct.
What can I do for you, Lieutenant?
It's a hell of a way to start your Sunday, but I got your number from Psych Services.
I'm at Bellevue, and we got an officer in a lot of trouble down here.
You want me to come down now?
I'd appreciate that.
It's McTaggert, and I'll be waiting for you at Psychiatric Emergency.
- All right, give me about 20 minutes, okay?
- Thank you.
I understand you were working undercover on the disappearance of some kids in Spanish Harlem.
Isn't that right, Tom?
May I call you Tom?
Are you Catholic?
Yes, I am.
I'm not a practicing Catholic.
They know who I am!
Who are "they," Tom?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
How do I know about you?
All right, I understand.
You have no reason to trust me yet.
But you don't have any reason to distrust me, do you?
The spirits help them.
They walk through walls.
- Don't forget that.
- I won't.
And they can see us in here right now, is that it?
What is it?
Easy.
They knew that I was on to them.
I walked in and they were waiting for me.
- Can you identify them?
- No.
When I came to, I found the body.
They got my shield.
Don't you get it?
Yes.
Oh, they're going to kill me.
No, no,no.
- I can feel it's started already.
- No, no.
Nobody can harm you in here.
I promise you that.
God can't save you.
The church can't save you.
They get right inside your body!
You can't stop them.
Seven powers.
You...
You think that you can stop them?
You think science can stop them?
- Oh, dear God...
- It's all right.
It's all right.
The eyes.
I saw his eyes!
Whose eyes, Tom?
Whose eyes?
They can get to anyone.
They can kill anybody!
You want them to know who you are?
DO you?
What do you think, is he gonna come out of it?
I don't know.
I need more time with him.
- He was one of my best guys.
- Maybe I should see the victim.
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.
It's the kid's parents.
Jesus.
What kind of a monster does that?
Been down the freezer again, eh, Lieutenant?
You're a real comedian, Rob.
Don't be a stranger.
Hit me again.
No, thank you.
Just coffee, please.
So, did we treat cops for alcohol abuse back in, where was it?
Milwaukee?
Minneapolis.
Oh, Minneapolis.
What the hell brought you to New York?
You don't mind my asking?
No, I went to graduate school at Columbia.
Uh, nice school, shitty neighborhood.
You got a family?
I have a son.
Thank you.
I lost my wife recently.
I'm sorry to hear that.
So what did Lopez have on this?
Nada.
Nothing.
Can I see his reports?
No.
Why not?
- They're not available.
- Hope you're off duty, Lieutenant.
Fuck off.
Is Lopez Catholic?
Yeah, sure.
The family is Cuban.
They practice this thing called Santeria.
- Ever hear of that?
- No.
It's a Latin thing.
A lot of them are into it up there.
They cut up chickens, magic, shit like that.
- And Lopez is into this?
- Yeah.
He kept it quiet, but...
You said he found the body on an altar, with a lot of religious paraphernalia, right?
There's at least 200 places sell that shit, East Island alone.
Wait a second, please.
If I'm evaluating a patient,
I'd call that a pretty strong lead.
Wouldn't you?
A citizen's got a right to his own religious preference.
That's the First Amendment.
If a citizen performs a human sacrifice, I'd say he forfeits that right.
Come on.
A psycho kills a kid, he makes it look like a religious ritual.
That kid was cut up with the precision of a surgeon, not a psychopath.
What are you afraid of, that Lopez is a suspect?
That it's one of your own?
It's not this religion, is it?
I don't call cutting up chickens a religion!
Maybe if you spent as much time in a barrio as I have, you wouldn't ask such dumb questions.
That's bullshit.
Just one last question, Lieutenant.
Is this all the assistance I'm gonna get trying to help that officer?
Think about it.
Thanks for the coffee.
Oh, no!
My clothes!

"Elegua is Saint Anthony. "
Hey, come on, get this cleaned up.
Oh, God.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You forgot your watch.
Did I?
You must have left it when you were painting the other day.
You forgot these, too.
They're a little soggy.
- Thanks.
- Still can't find the earring.
Want to come in?
Yes.
Thank you.
You know, I have no idea what I would've done without the watch.
You suppose my leaving it was some hidden expression of desire?
I don't know about that, but my returning it certainly was.
How long's it been?
About nine months.
Would she approve?
I approve.
I went a whole year after my divorce.
When was that?
About a year ago.
But who's counting?
- Didn't you used to live in New York?
- Mmm-hmm.
Back when I was young and foolish.
What does that make you now?
I should probably get back.
Hurry up, Chris.
We'll miss the show!
Now, Cal, there's time for at least another half a glass.
- There's a good fellow.
- As you wish, madam.
And you, madam.
How about you, Carmen?
CARMEN'.
Oh, no, gracias.
- Come on, you're no stranger to the grape.
- Oh, no, no.
Sounds like a lot of fun.
I haven't been to the planetarium since I was a little girl.
So why don't you join us?
As we begin ourjourney to the beginning of time.
What are you looking for, Bean?
- Where's my shell?
- I don't know.
Where is it?
Did she take it?
Just a minute, young man!
Chris, come back here!
Hey!
What do you think you're doing?
- It was an accident!
- It was not an accident!
It was!
- I'll go.
- Don't...
Don't worry about it.
- It's no big deal.
- He's tired.
You know he didn't...
- That's all right, Carmen.
I'll get it.
- It's no problem.
Just a minute, what is that?
That's one of my hankies, isn't it?
May I?
- What did she say?
- She said that she did it.
It's not anything bad.
She says she's a kind of matchmaker.
A yenta.
You know what a yenta is?
Yeah.
What's that got to do with this?
That's my earring.
She said she's cast a love spell on us.
- That's ridiculous.
- Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.
This is nothing bad.
You're such a nice couple.
Hey, don't look at me.
I like a guy, maybe I'll change my perfume, but I've got my pride.
Hello.
This is Lieutenant McTaggert.
What can I do for you, Lieutenant?
Has Tom Lopez tried to call you?
No, why?
He took a hike from Bellevue last night.
I think you better get over here.
What is it?
We got another kid like the one from the movie house.
Pier 11.
There'll be a launch waiting.
Hey, look over there.
What's that?
- Lieutenant.
- How are you?
The body is down here.
Worse than the one before.
- How old is he?
- Uh...
Eight, 10.
No I.D. He's a black kid.
Watch your step.
It's a tough climb.
They didn't tell me this was part of the job.
They don't tell you a lot of things.
It's just like the kid in the theater.
My God.
He's been here a couple of days.
You got the red and black candles, you got the ashes, the circle of ashes.
And a bottle of gasoline.
- Look at the way he's out up.
- So much blood.
Hey, Bob, get a load of this.
What do you think?
Oh, Jesus Christ!
How do you ever get used to it?
You don't.
Now maybe you know why a lot of cops hit the bottle.
Listen, Doc.
Newspapers get wind that some psycho cop is doing this, my job gets tougher, and it's shitty enough as it is.
Do me a favor.
No details to anybody, huh?
Psycho cop?
What do you think?
A few hours on the couch and Lopez was gonna get himself together?
You don't know that he did it.
I don't know that he didn't.
Lopez hasn't called you, has he?
No.
Weird fucking city you moved into, Doc.
Lopez.
Dig, I'm a hardcore rapper from my head to my toe
Excuse me, sir.
Could I talk to you for a second, please?
What do you want?
I'm looking for the man that wrote this book.
Oscar Sezine.
Is he here?
Uh, we're closed.
No, wait a second, sir.
I just need a minute of his time.
Believe me, it's very important.
- There is no one here.
- No, no, wait a second.
Sir!
Sir!
I'm with Psych Services,
NYPD!
Sir!
Thanks a lot!
Carmen.
Carmen.
What is all this stuff?
What are these things?
You did put them in Chris's room, didn't you?
- Si.
- I want to know why.
To bless him.
I'm trying to help him.
I'm trying to help him, too.
Sometimes these things are used in rituals, aren't they?
Si.
Sometimes those rituals involve the sacrificing of animals, don't they?
Sometimes.
What is the circle of ashes for?
Circle of the ashes?
I don't know nothing about that.
- That's not a part of Santeria?
- No.
All right, now listen to me.
If I find any more of this kind of stuff around here again
I'm going to have to let you go.
Is that clear?
But this is for proteccién.
I don't care what it's for.
It's a lot of superstitious nonsense to me.
And I don't want any more of it in the house.
Do you want any of these things 'cause I'm just gonna throw them away.
Okay, now, which one of these guys do you want?
How about that guy?
He looks pretty neat.
It's your birthday, you can have any one you want.
Come on, Bean, you've gotta make up your mind.
- I'll take that.
- This one?
Okay, happy birthday, Chris.
What do you say to Jessica?
Thanks.
Why are you such a sad sack today?
Three ices, please.
Hurry up, you guys.
Lemon.
- What flavor do you want?
- I don't want any.
Come on, Chris, sure you do.
No, I don't!
I'm sorry.
- Hey, Chris, this is really...
- No!
Chris!
Chris!
Chris!
Chris!
Chris!
Chris!
Chris!
Oh!
- God damn it!
- No!
No!
No!
- Don't you ever...
- I don't want her toy!
I don't want anything from her!
She's not my mom!
I want my mom!
Shut up and listen to me!
Do you know you almost killed yourself!
- I want my mom!
- Oh, God.
Come back here!
Chris!
Sure, and you've got lots of magic...
Oh, here they are.
Happy birthday, Chris!
Chris.
I'm sorry, Chris.
Honey, I'm so sorry I hurt you.
Listen to me.
You know I loved your mother very, very much, and I'll always love her.
But she's gone now.
- You don't care that she went away!
- That's not true.
- You wouldn't care if I went away!
- No, no.
You know that's not true.
Now, listen to me.
You hit me!
I'm sorry I hit you.
I promise I'll never hit you again.
I'll never do anything to hurt you.
You mean more to me than anyone else in the world.
Don't you know that?
I love you so much.
Please forgive me.
I just wanted him to have a really nice birthday.
- Well, he still can.
- It's not over yet.
- I didn't mean any harm.
- Of course you didn't.
You know how children are with new people.
Dr. Jamison.
Dr. Jamison, el telefono.
I'll take it up here, Carmen!
Hello.
- It's Lopez.
- Tom, where are you?
There's a diner on 126th and Lexington.
Come alone, okay?
Just you.
What do you mean?
You're in danger.
You and your son.
Hurry.
Tom, wait...
WOMAN'.
Okay, gracias.
- Hey, are you okay?
- Huh?
Si.
Oh, no!
Come on, back.
It's all right.
Let him through.
Get the cab outta here.
What the hell are you doing here?
Lopez called me.
He told me to be here.
Goddamn it, then why didn't you call me?
We're supposed to be working together.
- Please, ma'am, stand back.
- Where should I eat?
- Did you know him?
- No.
I don't.
- So, he was never here, before?
- I have never seen him before.
What'd he tell you when he called?
Nothing.
He just told me to meet him.
Did you understand anything he was saying?
Yes.
He kept saying, "Culebras!
Culebras!"
Who the hell is Culebras?
Nobody, sir.
That means "snakes."
Snakes?
Uh, did he, uh...
Did he do anything else before he started screaming?
Yes.
He was writing, and then he took the knife and stabbed himself.
- Where did he get the knife?
- From behind the counter.
I was using it.
Does that mean anything to you?
I'm talking to you in English, you're talking to her in Spanish.
What is this, a goddamn three ring circus, huh?
I'm, uh...
I'm asking you, you giving me a hard time or something?
- I'm not giving you a hard time.
- Are these all the files in this place,
- is all I'm asking you?
- I got it here.
Oscar Sezine?
- Yes.
- Why wouldn't you talk to me before?
Did you bring the police in here?
- Hey, you, Sezine.
- Yes?
Come on, get in here.
I wanna talk to you.
Who is this guy?
A friend of yours?
What the hell is this place supposed to be, anyway?
This is a licensed drug rehab center, huh?
Our doors are open to any troubled children.
We offer them help, assistance...
Yeah, yeah, I know that.
Even your own kid OD'd, huh?
Yes.
Does that have anything to do with why you're here?
Hey, wise guy-
I'm here to talk to you about Tom Lopez.
Did you know he was a cop?
Yes.
He's also a volunteer on staff.
He teaches boxing.
Coaches our Golden Gloves.
No, not anymore, he doesn't.
He killed himself about an hour ago.
- I'm shocked.
- I bet you are.
This kid here, Louis Montana, is he part of your drug rehabilitation program?
He was.
He ran away last week.
Is that right?
And did you see him after he ran away?
No.
- Did Tom Lopez know him?
- Yes, I believe he coached him.
Then he knew him.
You saw them together?
Yes, Why?
We found Louis Montana's body on a barge in the Hudson River yesterday.
Now, you wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you, Mr. Sezine?
Certainly not.
Mr. Sezine, you have a right to remain silent.
Anything you say could be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney and if you can't afford one, we'll provide one for you.
Is that clear?
Hey, you!
Get the hell out of here!
Go on!
Get out!
Fuck off.
You know what I'd really like to do?
I'd like to put this monkey on a grill and fry his ass until I get some straight fucking answers about this Santeria bullshit from you people.
That's my card.
Number at the precinct.
You call me tomorrow between 10:00 and 11:00.
Don't forget.
He hasn't slept for two days.
If you're not a cop, what are you?
I'm a therapist.
Tom Lopez is one of my patients.
I'm really very sorry about all this.
My God, do you really think we are savages?
That we'd be capable of killing children?
You said in your book that human sacrifice was practiced at one time.
Name me one religion where atrocities have not been committed in the name of a god.
Santeria is a force for good.
It is not a blood-cult trading on innocent lives!
- Then what are you people so afraid of?
- Of your ignorance.
Of your prejudice, because you use it as a weapon against us.
Tom Lopez was a good and decent man.
He was devoted to these children.
I don't believe he committed suicide.
I don't believe he had anything to do with that outrage!
Neither do I.
Robert Calder is the chairman of your board?
Yes.
He's our major contributor.
- He's not into Santeria?
- No.
Did Lopez know him?
We all do.
He organizes our fundraisers.
Yeah, it says here there's a fundraiser later on this week.
Could you arrange for me to go?
Yes.
- Dad, can we stop by the church?
- Why, Bean?
I want to light a candle for Mom.
Hey, Freddie, how are you?
This is chekete.
Oh, well, I'd prefer a vodka tonic.
I'm afraid this is all we are serving.
It's traditional.
It is also traditional to sip it slowly.
I can see that.
Our host.
Excuse me.
Robert Calder.
Quite a guy.
- What do you know about him?
- Not much.
Self-made man.
He took a share in one midtown building and turned it into a fortune.
Getting into everything these days.
Money markets, energy, the whole bit.
The person I spoke to you about would like to meet you.
May I introduce Dr. Cal Jamison?
- How do you do, sir.
- How do you do?
- This is my friend, Jessica Halliday.
- Hello.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Miss Halliday,
I'm Jennifer, Mr. Calder's assistant.
Oscar's told me of your interest.
Well, actually, a friend of mine told me about your organization.
I'm very impressed.
Well, you're the sort of man we're looking for.
Really?
I understand you knew my friend.
Officer Tom Lopez.
Terrible tragedy.
Did you know him well?
Not as well as I would have liked, no.
No, I suppose none of us did.
We always wish we'd known someone better when they're taken from us unexpectedly.
I lost my only son five years ago.
Drug overdose.
I live with that every day.
It tests one's faith, doesn't it?
It can also help you find it.
- Are you a religious man, Doctor?
- Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Yes and no.
Sign of the times.
The representative from the mayor's office is here.
I hope we get a chance to work together.
It was a pleasure to meet you.
Pleasure meeting you, Mr. Calder.
- Bob.
- Bob.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Would you like a cigar?
Oh, no, thanks.
I'm trying to cut down.
- Smoke attracts the gods.
- It makes them want to join the party.
How about that?
I'm gonna go pee.
I'll be right back.
- Did they show you a warrant?
- Oh, yes, they did.
How could anybody think that anybody connected with our organization had something to do with something so monstrous?
Well, clearly, Oscar, they made a mistake.
- Let the lawyers handle it.
- I tell you, if all the good work we've done is destroyed by this...
Oscar, that's not gonna happen, you have my word on that.
What is the detective's name?
McTaggert.
Lieutenant McTaggert.
I don't want you to worry about this.
Oscar.
MAN'.
We are proud to present the chairman of our board, Mr. Robert Calder.
CALDER'.
Thank you.
Thank you.
On behalf of the A.C.H.E. program, and on our fifth anniversary,
I'm especially proud to say that thanks to your generous contributions, during our sixth year,
A.C.H.E. program offices will be opening in Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami and Washington, D.C.
I have a check here for $50,000.
Now, this is a personal check.
Wait a minute.
Don't worry, I'm good for it.
My challenge to you tonight is that collectively we top the contributions that were made in this room last year.
Now, our helpers will be moving amongst you soon.
So, the next hand you feel in your pocket may not be your own.
We'd like to collect $425,111 from this room!
Now I know you're up to it.
I have faith!
And remember, just remember, it's still tax deductible.
Thank you.
What should we do?
Don't touch him!
He's not one of us!
Go!
Quickly.
Go now!
What the hell are you doing?
Stop it!
Stop it!
Get away from him!
Get out!
Stay with him!
I warned you about this, Carmen.
Now you're fired!
Get out!
But the child!
You don't understand!
No, you don't understand!
You're fired!
Go!
He's in danger!
I'm trying to protect him!
Protect him?
The kid is hysterical for Christ's sake.
Get out!
I don't want to hear!
- I don't wanna hear...
- Please, let me finish doing this!
You are finished!
Now go!
- You don't know what you're doing!
- I know exactly what I'm doing!
My God, you're killing me!
No, no!
If I see you around here again, I'm gonna call the police.
Is that clear enough?
MCTAGGERTI What's the matter with you guys?
It won't happen again.
Come on, It won't happen again.
It happens all the time!
Do me a favor, will you?
Keep the goddamn greens on the desk and out of the box!
I'm sorry.
Sure.
Okay.
"I'm sorry"!
You always say, "I'm sorry"!
For Christ's sake, get your act together, huh?
Hey, Cal.
- How are you doing?
- Lieutenant?
Is this a bad time?
It's always a bad time around here.
Let's go.
- What's up?
- What's in here.
Sezine's story on his son checks out.
Autopsy confirms the kid OD'd.
That's what I expected.
What about the Calder boy?
Same thing.
Overdose five years ago.
Five years ago, this boy was 8 years old.
8-year-olds don't usually OD.
- Where's the autopsy report?
- I don't know.
I...
I can't find it.
Are you serious?
Nobody knows where it is.
Are you saying you lost it, or somebody doesn't want it found?
Listen.
We're dropping this investigation now.
We're laying the murders off on Lopez.
Lopez didn't kill anybody but himself and you know it.
Where is this coming from?
Lopez is dead.
We got him tied to the kids.
He took his life out of his own guilt.
We got enough to close now!
Who the hell do you think you're kidding?
You want...
You want me to show you?
Come here.
You didn't see this.
CAL'.
Culebras.
- Sorry we're late.
- Oh, no problem.
We're all set now.
All right.
All aboard.
There are plenty of good seats still available.
Tickets please.
I have my ticket.
Now listen, be a good boy.
I'll be out in a couple of days and then we'll go to Santa Fe to see grandma and grandpa, okay?
- I'm going to go sailing.
- Sailing?
I fully expect you to be captain of the ship, Mr. Christopher.
I'll call tomorrow and you'll tell me all about it.
I love you, Dad.
I love you, too, Bean.
Have a great time, kiddo.
- All ashore that's going ashore.
- Come along, matey, here we go!
Watch your feet.
- Don't you worry about anything.
- Thanks, Kate.
See you both Friday.
I have a glorious dinner planned.
- See you.
Bye-bye.
- Bye, Dad.
Bye.
Why would my housekeeper take it from my son?
Is it Santeria?
No, this is not Santeria.
It is black magic, brujeria.
This symbol belongs to a god of destruction and pestilence,
El engafiador, the trickster.
What the hell does it have to do with my son?
There was, uh, a ritual when a tribe was threatened by drought, flood or destruction by its enemies.
Three children were offered to the god.
Sacrificed?
Elder sons sacrificed by their fathers.
- The last child, at summer solstice.
- Why?
To gain power, to destroy their enemies.
I've seen the bodies of two children.
This ritual is being performed now.
Was Carmen involved?
No, I believe she tried to cast a spell of protection.
She was not strong enough.
It was turned against her.
Protection from what?
Look.
You both felt the power of the man who killed Tom Lopez and those two children.
I'm sure of it.
You looked into his eyes.
Did Calder bring that man here?
I believe that's what Lopez was trying to tell you.
What can I do?
Please, tell me what I can do.
The summer solstice is on June 21st.
Four days away.
You must seek protection for your son and for yourself.
I'd need a priest, a santero.
I am a santero.
And you must trust me and do as I say.
- Cal, we shouldn't be doing this.
- You don't have to stay.
- I think we should both leave, right now.
- No.
This doesn't feel right.
- Cal, please!
- I don't know what else to do.
Please kneel.
Water to purify.
May your enemies never see what we are doing here.
Stand up.
Turn.
Offer the blood for your son's life.
- Oh, here's one.
- Another one?
Yeah.
This kid comes running home from school one day, he's got a brown package under his arm.
So he says to his mother, "Hey, Mom, look what I found..."
Hold on a second.
Detective Connolly. 2-7 squad.
CAL'.
This is Dr. Jamison.
Lieutenant McTaggert, please.
No, I'm sorry, Doc.
He's out sick today.
Guess the flu's making its rounds.
All right.
I'll call his home.
Thanks.
Hey.
Why don't you come with us?
I am.
No, I mean to Santa Fe, too.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
This could get serious, you know?
I hope so.
- Hello?
- Kate, it's Cal.
- Oh, darling, how are you?
- I'm fine.
How are you?
- I'm just great.
- How's the weather?
It's fabulous, and the forecast is even better.
Oh, that's great.
Ls Chris behaving himself all right?
He's a delight.
I'd half forgotten about eight year olds.
He's run me half ragged.
I know what you mean.
I guess I'm used to it.
Can I talk to him, please?
Oh, I'm sorry, darling.
He's out in the boat with Dennis right now.
- But I'll give him a big hug.
- All right, please do that for me.
- Will we see you here this evening?
- Yes, of course.
Oh, that's wonderful.
We have the whole weekend planned.
- Well, we're looking forward to it.
- All right.
See you later, dear.
- Yeah, we'll see you later.
- Drive carefully.
- We will.
- Kisses.
'BYe~bye.
- Bye.
- Yeah.
- Hey, you all right?
I'm okay, I'm just really tired.
You don't sound okay.
I'm coming right over.
No, no, no.
Really.
I just think I need, um, some more sleep.
Look, I'm...
Maybe I should call Kate and Dennis and tell them we would be out in the morning.
- No, you go ahead.
- You sure?
Yes.
Call me when you get there.
And give Chris my love, okay?
Okay, I will.
You take care.
- Bye.
- B ye.
Cal?
Cal?
Shit.
I'm sorry no one's here to take your call right now, but if you leave your name and...
Hello.
- Who is this?
- It's McTaggen'.
- Lieutenant.
- My apartment.
Got to see you.
- What is it?
What's wrong?
- Just get over here!
Do it!
Wait a second.
MCTaggert?
Who is it?
It's me, Cal.
Shut the door.
Step into the light.
I want to see your face.
What's going on?
You don't need the gun.
Like hell I don't.
I saw them.
They're out there.
No, there's nobody out there.
You goddamn liar!
No, Sean, I swear to you.
I came alone.
I'm here to help you.
Open that.
What is it?
Calder's son.
It wasn't an overdose.
He killed his own fucking son.
Where did you get this?
Buried files.
They didn't think I knew where to find them, but I did.
That's what they're out there now, they're watching.
Go on.
You answer it.
Hello.
See?
You believe me now?
Why haven't they done anything to you?
What have they done to you, Sean?
I can't move.
"Oh, my God, I am heartily sorry
"for having offended Thee.
"And I detest
"All my sins
"because of Thy just punishments.
"But most of all because they offend Thee, my God,
"who art all good, and worthy of all my love.
"I firmly resolve..."
Everything's going to be all right now.
No.
Take the gun.
Kill him.
The police won't help you.
He'll get to anybody.
Do it yourself, please, I'm begging you.
Go.
Okay-
Destroy Calder.
God help you.
"I firmly resolve,
"with the help of Thy grace, to sin no more."
Yeah, hello.
Marty, it's me, Cal.
Listen, I've got something very important I want you to keep for me.
Sure.
You okay?
Jessica!
Marty, stay there.
I'll call you right back!
Jessica.
Jessica.
Jessica.
Oh, my God.
- Vital signs?
- BP, 80 over 60.
Pulse, 140.
Respiration, 30 and shallow.
Wait outside, please.
I'm sorry there's no one here to take your call, but if you leave your name and number, I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
Please speak after the beep.
Cal, it's Kate.
If you hear this, do not call me.
Change of plans.
Oh, please, God, what have I done?
Cal, I'm bringing Chris.
Will explain all when I see you.
Meet me, Flanders Inn...
Hello?
Hello?
Marty, make sure they take care of her till I get back.
MARTY'.
I will!
She's covered.
Look, I told everyone at the hospital I'm a lawyer.
What are they, idiots?
Relax.
Get some sleep.
- Can you find your way back?
- No problem.
Hey.
Keep this for me, will you?
Thanks for everything.
I'll see you.
The prodigal son returns!
- Forgive me, Dennis, I'm terribly sorry.
- Not a word of it.
Come in.
Kate's gone to her all-night market.
She never seems to think we have enough food out here.
- Last door on the end.
- Okay.
- Oh, thank you, Dennis.
- Not at all.
- Hell of a week for you, my friend.
- Been a hell of a year.
That's true.
It is hell, isn't it?
There's no point in denying it.
The kind of loss you suffered, that kind of grief, it's dreadful.
But what can you do?
Be a man about it.
That's what you've done.
You just go on!
And then one day, you wake up and it's just the slightest bit better.
That's the way it changes, little by little, small increments.
Well, that's the way it was with us.
We thought we'd never get over it.
But you do.
When was that?
Kate's fieldwork.
Post-graduate.
Summer of '46.
The Sudan. 11 months in the bush.
Haven't I ever told you this story?
No.
Worst drought in 50 years.
Then cholera.
We saw half the tribe decimated.
Daniel was only four years old.
Oh, I'd argued against bringing him, but Kate insisted.
She couldn't bear to leave him that long.
Then, when Daniel took sick, the elders of the tribe came to see us.
We'd developed a trust with them by then.
A bond.
What they suggested seemed unthinkable, against nature.
But you see, Cal,
Daniel was so clearly beyond any medical help.
As outsiders, it was really a great honor.
Daniel was very brave.
And the drought did end, Cal.
We were delivered.
The life of another child was saved.
A most remarkable child, Cal.
Over the years, he's grown so special to us, almost like a son.
He's taught us so much.
Of course, you're uncertain, Cal, naturally.
So was I until I met him.
Now imagine, if you can, a life without uncertainty.
Freedom from doubt.
The ability to choose.
Single-mindedness.
One life from each of us, Cal, is all he asks.
And he rewards our devotion a thousand fold.
Personal desires?
Oh, yes, of course.
Anything.
- That's part of it.
- It's only the beginning.
There was a time, Cal, when man was at one with the gods, before the Fall.
Now we're at one again and their benediction is power.
It's a power you can't imagine.
Power to create a world of our choosing.
Power to destroy those who oppose us.
Chris was chosen, Cal.
When he found the shell, remember?
It was a sign.
Cal.
Cal.
We want you to join us!
It must be the father.
"We consecrate this ground
"with this father's humble offering.
"We seek the strength and wisdom
"of our benefactors.
"We call upon the ancient gods to renew our strength.
"And guide your hand to strike down the enemies of our faith and this nation.
"We welcome our brother, Cal,
"reborn into your grace.
"Restore nature's order.
"The power, which is our birthright.
"The glory, which is our destiny.
"Our enemies consumed by rings of fire.
"Our strength reborn
"in sacrifice!"
Do you believe?
Yes, I do believe.
Chris!
Dad?
Dad.
"Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater, had a wife and couldn't keep her."
- You okay?
- I'm all right!
Where is he?
- Fucking maniacs!
Who are these guys?
- Chris!
Theyjumped in the elevator.
They took him up.
Chris!
I'll take this one.
Chris!
- Dad!
- Chris!
- Let me go!
- Chris!
God damn.
Chris!
Dad!
Chris?
Dad?
Dad?
Chris!
Chris!
Chris!
God gave His only begotten son.
Let him go!
Remember that?
It is God's will that innocence redeem the world.
Why we give our sons to war in the name of peace.
Sacrifice our children, our families to false gods, ambition, lust, pride!
- Dad.
- It's hypocrisy!
This is all lies.
I was a slave, I had no life!
You have no life!
God gives you life!
You give them innocence, the gods give you life.
And your son was innocent, wasn't he?
Peter, that was your son's name, wasn't it?
And you sacrificed your son to the gods, didn't you?
That was my salvation.
I was reborn.
It must have taken great strength and great courage.
Tell me.
He looked into my eyes.
Dad?
He forgave me.
Peter.
He understood.
No.
Chris?
I'm over here.
Come to me.
No.
You come to me.
Let's go, boy.
Hey, Bean, how's it going?
- Hey, Dad.
Got the barbecue sauce?
- Sure do.
- Let's go easy on it this time.
- Oh.
Hey, don't you look beautiful.
- I'm glad you're home.
- Me, too.
- Be careful with that, Chris.
- All right, Mom.
Mom?
No, no.
It'll keep.
Mom?
Maybe it won't!
Hey, Chris, that looks terrific.
You don't need my help at all.
Don't burn yourself.
What is it, boy?
What is it?
Easy, fella.
What's wrong, boy?
What is it?
Anybody up there?
All right, out!
I did it for us.
We'll be safe now.
Mom?
Knock, knock.
It is too early for "Knock, knock." Come on, eat up.
We're running late.
Chris, give me a break!
Must it be World War II this morning?
World War III.
Cute, kid.
8:30, Cal!
- Why didn't you tell me it was so late?
- I just did.
- Dad?
- What?
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?
- Dwayne.
- Dwayne who?
Dwayne the bathtub, I'm dwowning!
That's terrible!
That's not my lunch, is it?
Not now, it isn't.
- When did your friends leave this morning?
- I thought they were your friends.
They left about 3:00.
You used to be able to go all night.
I know, but I can't do it anymore.
What can't you do anymore?
Eat your breakfast.
Do you think I should have served the last drink in my pajamas?
Shoes and socks on.
Let's go.
Oh, shit.
Great.
- Terrific, Cal.
- I got it.
Not the socks!
- Hit the showers.
- Right.
Mom?
What?
Coffee machine.
Perfect!
Mom.
What is it?
Jesus!
Lisa, no!
Oh, my God, no!
Chris, don't touch her!
Jesus Christ!
My God!
Christ!
Por favor, don't break nothing!
And be careful from the walls.
Mrs. Halliday just painted them.
Follow me, okay?
You did what anyone would have done.
It happened so fast.
I just reacted.
He was trying to help.
Christ, the man's got four kids!
You'll be more effective when you do go back out there, if you begin to forgive yourself.
That's what this is all about, Frank.
That's how I can help you, if you'll let me.
I want to.
I do.
It's...
Good.
I'd say we made a pretty good beginning, wouldn't you?
I'll set you up for next week, then.
What have you got there, little guy?
Chief Black Cloud.
Are you sick?
I'm sorry.
- You can call me anytime.
- Right.
See you next Thursday.
Hopefully we'll be a little better settled in by then.
- Thank you, Doctor.
- You're welcome.
Are you all right, Bean?
Not so fast, my friend.
From now on, I don't think you should play in here while I'm working.
Is it a deal?
Okay.
What do we got here?
Flowers.
Mrs. Ruiz and I are gonna plant some for Mom.
Like these?
Mom wants me to.
Do you believe me?
I believe she would want you to.
Sure.
Take it easy, you guys.
I just finished painting this place.
No!
My beautiful wall!
I did this wall with my own hands and now it looks like my first apartment.
- It's just a little gouge.
- It's a giant crater!
I'm gonna have to start from scratch!
Fill it, sand it!
What's the problem?
This. 10 years ago, I wouldn't have cared.
Now I want a wall to look like a wall.
Let me take a look at it.
- You don't have to do that.
- It's okay.
I'm taking care of it.
Thank you very much.
That's great.
Who says chivalry is dead?
Alive and well in New York.
Amazing.
How does it feel to have your whole life stuffed in little boxes?
A little cramped.
Here's the electrician's number.
He's expecting your call.
Painter's coming on Sunday.
I'll get to the kitchen faucet soon.
You'll fix it yourself?
Sure.
I'm the landlady.
Hey, listen, I lost an earring maybe in your apartment.
It's pretty hard to miss.
Then, it might be in my bag.
If you see it, will you let me know?
I'll keep an eye out.
- Great.
How Is Carmen working out?
- Fine.
She's terrific with Chris.
Shit!
These cops are going to do wonders for my parking ticket situation.
I'll put in a word for you downtown.
If there's anything else you need, I'm across the street.
Officer?
Have you started writing that thing out yet?
Look out!
- The ball is in the clear.
He scores!
- Wait for me!
Marty Wertheimer, please.
- Who's calling?
- It's Cal Jamison.
- Can you hold?
- Yes, I'll hold.
I told you never to call me here.
What do you want?
I'm a busy man.
Hi, buddy, how are you?
Great.
Is that a great apartment that I found for you all by myself?
And how about the landlady?
Not bad, huh?
Do you know what I had to do to get that?
By the way, where's my commission?
Shut up already.
You done great.
It's wonderful.
No complaints.
Where are you?
You're late.
I'm in the park.
- The park?
You're supposed to be here.
- I'm on my way.
I've got Chris with me.
Great.
- It's okay if I bring him?
- Yeah, please.
Okay.
See you soon.
Chris!
This is unusual for Central Park.
What are you doing down here?
What do you mean?
I run here everyday.
- Did you see anyone else here?
- No.
Just me.
- Is this all you saw?
- That's all I saw!
Calm down, miss.
What are you doing here?
I run here every day with my friend!
Today, she had to go to the dentist.
- I'll need some information.
- Information?
What kind of information?
- Like your name first, please.
- My name?
My name is Muriel Greenburg.
Do you spell Greenburg:
G-r-e-e-n-b-e-r-g?
No.
B-u-r-g.
Greenburg.
I may need more information later on.
What's your address?
Sorry.
Come on.
Folks, the show is over!
I'm sure you can find something better to do than look at this garbage.
Come on, start moving.
Get out of here, let's go.
Keep moving.
Brujería.
Keep going.
Brujería.
All right, just keep going away.
Dad, do you believe in God?
I believe in a god.
What you got there?
May I?
- Where'd you get this?
- Found it.
- Where?
- In the park.
Where in the park?
Somewhere.
It's a wishing shell.
How do you know that?
I just do.
Where is he?
There he is.
- Hi, Marty.
- Chris, how are you doing?
I've been waiting all morning for you.
- How are you?
- Who's this bum?
You have to watch these guys who hang out in the park.
- What's this?
- What?
Bubble-gum?
Don't you know where to park your gum?
- Where?
- On the bedpost, for crying out loud.
You got any questions about important stuff like this, you come ask your lawyer.
- Okay.
- Okay.
I ever show you this one?
Twice.
Okay, wise guy, you get them apart.
I'll bring him right back.
Promise.
- Coffee?
- No.
One.
Regular.
Thanks.
Wait a minute.
We agree, so what's the problem?
I don't have a problem with the idea of a lawsuit.
I don't want Chris to have to relive it all.
Neither do I.
But that coffee machine was fuckin' defective and we gotta nail them so no one else is killed.
So long as Chris doesn't have to testify.
I mean it.
- I feel very strongly about this.
- You and me both.
This will not go to trial.
I promise you.
They'd be crazy.
They'll settle.
Do you smoke?
No, thanks, I quit.
Yeah, me too.
I quit at least twice this week already.
Thanks.
I love Chris, you know that.
He's a great kid.
Tell you the truth, he's not the one I'm worried about.
- I'm all right.
- That's it? "I'm all right"?
You spend your time listening to cops' problems you can't talk about your own?
It's lonely.
Yeah?
I'm trying to pick up the pieces.
It really feels strange being back.
The city's changed a lot.
Some days I'm not so sure it was a good idea to bring Chris here.
But in a funny way, it's brought us closer together.
You need anything at all, I'm there before you hang up the phone.
I know.
- I feel better.
You?
- I feel better.
Sit down.
Linda?
You want to send in Mr. Jamison, Esquire, please?
What is this?
My 11:00 number.
Come on in, kid.
Sit down.
Get a load o' this.
I win.
Cheater.
Hi, Carmen.
Any calls?
No calls.
But this come for you.
From where?
It's a housewarming present from Mrs. Halliday.
- She make it herself, for you.
- Wasn't that nice?
It's very beautiful, si?
Si.
Stunning.
- Are there any more of these perishables?
- This is only dry stuff and spices.
- And did you buy this radio here?
- In London.
I'll have to take this apart.
I'll put it back.
Arriving passengers who have cleared customs place your luggage on the conveyor belt...
Could I see that?
Open this, please.
Just personal items.
No need to look in there.
All right.
Remember this bowl?
That little Indian boy made it.
- We have one just like it.
- You do?
I love the things he made.
Vino?
Where's the vino?
- And cilantro.
- How's it going?
Ambrosia.
- Ambrosia!
- Taste.
Well?
What do you think?
Don't be bashful.
- I'm inured to criticism.
- Hot.
Nonsense.
Good for you.
Therapeutic, anti-depressant.
- News to me.
- I stand before you, living proof.
You put the NYPD on gumbo twice a week, and you're out of business.
Why don't you give that a good stir and then we'll bring in the rice.
Useless knife.
I'll have to get another.
It's lovely.
Who gave it to you?
I found it.
Really?
Here.
Show it to Dennis.
- What's this?
- My shell.
- It's your shell, is it?
- Yep.
You seem pretty sure about that.
It's a beautiful piece of work.
Have you seen this?
Yes.
You still got that thing, Chris?
That's his wishing shell.
What do you suppose you could make out of this?
I don't know.
What about a necklace?
That's the day we went to Osage.
The reservation.
Remember that?
- Remember that?
- And the day I got Chief Black Cloud.
That's right.
And Dennis bought me the arrowheads.
God.
Got a memory like an elephant.
There's Mom.
She looked so pretty.
That was a very happy day, wasn't it?
My prize pupil.
In anthropology?
I always thought one day, she'd be teaching me.
Look at that face.
That was the day we went to visit the Ojibwa.
Remember?
About 40 degrees below zero.
They had fires inside the tent.
It must have been 70 degrees below, with the wind chill.
It was quite a day, wasn't it?
I'm sorry.
I remember taking those pictures.
That was the last time we were all together.
Oh, my.
How does Chris seem to you?
Does he seem all right?
- He's a remarkable little boy.
- I think he's doing all right, actually.
Thanks.
The kitchen all fixed up, Dr. Jamison.
Thank you, Carmen.
- Hasta mañana.
- Hasta mañana.
- Buenas noches.
- Buenas noches.
We've got to stay back here.
Sorry, you can't get through here.
- Where is he?
- He's inside.
- Lopez call this in?
- He did.
- Where is he?
- Behind the screen.
We can't get near him.
Keeps asking for you.
- What do you got?
- We got a dead kid.
I want you to understand that!
Brujería.
How old is he?
He looks to be about 9 years old.
He's only a kid.
There's so much blood.
Look at the ashes.
They're right around where the body was.
Jesus Christ almighty.
Just get McTaggert here, that's all.
Don't you come any closer, all right?
Don't do it.
Quit fucking around with me!
Nobody's fucking around with you.
Did you call this in?
- Yes, Lieutenant.
- What's the problem?
Jesus Christ, did you see what they did to that kid?
I saw.
What do you know about it?
- They took my badge.
- Who took your badge?
Who took it, Tom?
You don't know what they could do to me.
You did a good job, now we're here.
Let us have it.
We'll go to the station and make a report.
No!
You can't stop them.
You can't do anything.
You don't understand anything.
It doesn't work!
I'll be safe.
Get the gun!
Get him the hell out of here, fast!
Why did you stop me?
We can't do anything!
Brujería.
McTaggert.
Get it straight!
They know who I am!
Let go!
I'm a cop, too!
Goddamn you!
I'm here, Chris!
It's all right.
It's all right, sweetheart.
It's just a bad dream.
It's all right, baby.
- Hello?
- Is this Dr. Jamison?
Speaking.
Good.
This is Lt. McTaggert, 27th Precinct.
What can I do for you, Lieutenant?
I'm sorry, but I got your number from Psych Services.
I'm at Bellevue.
I've got an officer in a lot of trouble here.
You want me to come down now?
I'd appreciate that.
It's McTaggert.
I'll be waiting for you at Psychiatric Emergency.
All right, give me about 20 minutes.
I understand you were working undercover on the disappearance of some kids in Spanish Harlem.
Is that right, Tom?
May I call you Tom?
Are you Catholic?
Yes, I am.
I'm not a practicing Catholic.
They know who I am!
Who are "they"?
No.
How do I know about you?
I understand.
You have no reason to trust me, but why distrust me?
The spirits help them.
They walk through walls.
- Don't forget that.
- I won't.
They can see us in here now, is that it?
What is it?
Easy.
They knew that I was on to them.
I walked in and they were waiting for me.
- Can you identify them?
- No.
When I came to, I found the body.
They got my shield.
Don't you get it?
They're going to kill me.
I can feel it's started already.
Nobody can harm you in here.
I promise you that.
God can't save you.
The church can't save you.
They get right inside your body!
You can't stop them.
Seven powers.
You think that you can stop them?
You think science can stop them?
It's all right.
The eyes.
I saw his eyes!
Whose eyes?
They can get to anyone.
They can kill anybody!
You want them to know who you are?
Do you?
- Do you think he'll come out of it?
- I need more time with him.
- He was one of my best guys.
- Maybe I should see the victim.
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.
It's the kid's parents.
Jesus.
What kind of a monster does that?
Been down to the freezer again?
You're a real comedian.
Don't be a stranger.
Hit me again.
No, thank you.
Just coffee, please.
Did we treat cops for alcohol abuse back in Milwaukee?
Minneapolis.
Hello, Minneapolis.
What the hell brought you to New York?
You don't mind my asking?
I went to graduate school at Columbia.
Nice school, shitty neighborhood.
You got a family?
I have a son.
Thank you.
I lost my wife recently.
I'm sorry to hear that.
What did Lopez have on this?
Nada.
Nothing.
Can I see his reports?
No.
Why not?
- They're not available.
- Hope you're off duty, Lieutenant.
Fuck off.
Is Lopez Catholic?
Sure.
The family is Cuban.
They practice a thing called Santería.
Ever hear of it?
No.
It's a Latin thing.
A lot of them are into it.
They cut up chickens, magic, shit like that.
- And Lopez is into this?
- He kept it quiet.
He found the body on an altar with a lot of religious paraphernalia, right?
There's at least 200 places that sell that shit.
Wait a second.
I'm evaluating a patient.
That's a pretty strong lead.
A citizen's got a right to his own religious preference.
If he performs a human sacrifice, I'd say he forfeits that right.
A psycho kills a kid, he makes it look like a religious ritual.
That kid was cut up with the precision of a surgeon, not a psychopath.
What are you afraid of, that Lopez is a suspect?
That it's one of your own?
It's not this religion?
I don't call cutting up chickens a religion!
If you knew the barrio the way I do, you wouldn't ask such dumb questions.
That's bullshit.
Just one last question.
Is this all the assistance I'll get trying to help that officer?
Think about it.
Thanks for the coffee.
Oh, no!
My clothes!
"Santería is 1,000 years older than Christianity...
"...brought by slaves to the Caribbean.
"Their African gods are hidden in Catholic saints.
"Chango.
"Santa Barbara.
"Elegua is Saint Anthony."
Come on, get this cleaned up.
God.
Hi.
Hi.
You forgot your watch.
Did I?
You must have left it when you were painting.
You forgot these, too.
They're a little soggy.
Thanks.
Still can't find the earring.
Want to come in?
Thank you.
I have no idea what I would I have done without the watch.
You suppose my leaving it was some hidden expression of desire?
I don't know that, but my returning it certainly was.
How long has it been?
About nine months.
Would she approve?
I approve.
I went a whole year after my divorce.
When was that?
About a year ago.
But who's counting?
Didn't you used to live in New York?
Back when I was young and foolish.
What does that make you now?
I should probably get back.
Hurry up or we'll miss the show!
There's time for at least another half a glass.
As you wish, madam.
And you, madam.
How about you, Carmen?
No, gracias.
Come on, you're no stranger to the grape.
Sounds like fun.
I haven't been to the Planetarium since I was a girl.
Why don't you join us?
As we begin our journey to the beginning of time...
What are you looking for?
- Where's my shell?
- I don't know.
Where is it?
Did she take it?
Just a minute, young man!
Come back here!
What are you doing?
- It was an accident!
- It was not!
It was!
- I'll go.
- Don't worry about it.
- It's no big deal.
- He's tired.
- I'll get it, Carmen.
- It's no problem.
Just a minute, what is that?
That's one of my hankies.
May I?
- What did she say?
- She said that she did it.
It's not bad.
She says she's a kind of matchmaker.
A yenta.
Do you know what that is?
What's that got to do with this?
That's my earring.
She said she cast a love spell on us.
- That's ridiculous.
- I'm sorry you feel that way.
This is nothing bad.
You're such a nice couple.
Don't look at me.
I like a guy, maybe I'll change my perfume, but I've got my pride.
This is Lt. Mc Taggert.
What can I do for you?
- Has Tom Lopez called you?
- No, why?
He took a hike from Bellevue last night.
You better get over here.
What is it?
We got another kid like the one from the movie house.
Pier 11.
Look over there.
What is that?
Lieutenant.
The body is down here.
Worse than the one before.
How old is he?
8. 10.
No I.D. He's a black kid.
Watch your step.
It's a tough climb.
They didn't tell me this was part of the job.
They don't tell you a lot of things.
It's just like the kid in the theatre.
He's been here a couple of days.
You got the red and black candles, and the circle of ashes.
And a bottle of gasoline.
- Look at the way he's cut up.
- So much blood.
Jesus Christ!
How do you ever get used to it?
You don't.
Now maybe you know why a lot of cops hit the bottle.
Listen, Doc.
Newspapers find out some psycho cop is doing this, my job gets shittier than it is.
Do me a favor.
No details to anybody, huh?
Psycho cop?
Do you think a few hours on the couch and Lopez will get himself together?
You don't know that he did it.
I don't know that he didn't.
Lopez hasn't called you, has he?
No.
Weird fucking city you moved into, Doc.
Lopez.
Excuse me.
Could I talk to you for a second, please?
What do you want?
I'm looking for the man that wrote this.
Oscar Sezine.
Is he here?
We're closed.
I just need a minute of his time.
Believe me, it's very important.
- There is no one here.
- Wait a second.
Sir!
I'm with Psych Services NYPD!
Thanks a lot!
Carmen.
What is all this stuff?
What are these things?
You put them in Chris's room, didn't you?
- Si.
- I want to know why.
To bless him.
I'm trying to help him.
I'm trying to help him, too.
Sometimes these are used in rituals, aren't they?
Si.
Sometimes those rituals involve animal sacrifice, don't they?
Sometimes.
What is the circle of ashes for?
Circle of ashes?
I don't know nothing about that.
- That's not a part of Santería?
- No.
If I find this kind of stuff around here again, I'll have to let you go, is that clear?
This is for protección.
I don't care what it's for.
It's a lot of superstitious nonsense.
And I don't want any more of it in the house.
Do you want any of these, 'cause I'm going to throw them away.
Which one of these guys do you want?
How about that guy?
He looks pretty neat.
It's your birthday, you can have any one you want.
Come on, Bean, you've gotta make up your mind.
- I'll take that.
- This one?
Happy birthday, sir.
What do you say to Jessica?
Thanks.
Why are you so sad today?
Three ices, please.
Hurry up, you guys.
Lemon.
- What flavor do you want?
- I don't want any.
Come on, sure you do.
No, I don't!
I'm sorry.
- This is really...
- No!
- Goddamn it!
- No!
- Don't you ever...
- I don't want toys or anything from her!
She's not my mom!
I want my mom!
Shut up and listen!
Do you know you almost killed yourself!
I want my mom!
Come back here!
Happy birthday, Chris!
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry if I hurt you.
Listen to me.
You know I loved your mother very much, and I'll always love her.
But she's gone now.
- You don't care that she went away!
- That's not true.
You wouldn't care if I went away!
- You know that's not true.
- You hit me!
I'm sorry I hit you.
I promise I'll never hit you again.
I'll never do anything to hurt you.
You mean more to me than anyone else in the world.
Don't you know that?
I love you so much.
Please forgive me.
I just wanted him to have a really nice birthday.
- He still can.
- It's not over yet.
- I didn't mean any harm.
- Of course you didn't.
You know how children are with new people.
Dr. Jamison.
I'll take it up here!
Hello.
- It's Lopez.
- Where are you?
There's a diner on 126th and Lexington.
Come alone, okay?
Just you.
What do you mean?
You're in danger.
You and your son.
Hurry.
Are you okay?
Si.
Agua, por favor.
Caliente.
Qué pasa?
It's all right.
Let him through.
- What are you doing here?
- Lopez called me and told me to come.
Why didn't you call me?
We're supposed to work together.
Please, ma'am, stand back.
- Did you know him?
- No.
I don't.
- He was never here before?
- I've never seen him.
What did he tell you when he called?
Nothing.
He just told me to meet him.
Did you understand anything he was saying?
Yes.
He kept saying, "Culebras!"
Who the hell is Culebras?
Nobody, sir.
That means "snakes."
Snakes?
Did he do anything else before he started screaming?
He was writing, and then he took the knife and stabbed himself.
- Where did he get the knife?
- From behind the counter.
I was using it.
Does that mean anything to you?
I'm talking to you in English, you're talking to her in Spanish.
What is this, a three-ring circus?
Are you giving me a hard time?
- I'm not giving you a hard time.
- Are these all the files?
Oscar Sezine?
Why wouldn't you talk to me before?
Did you bring the police here?
- Hey, you, Sezine.
- Yes?
Get in here.
I want to talk to you.
Who is this guy?
A friend of yours?
What the hell is this place, anyway?
This is a licensed drug rehab center?
Our doors are open to troubled children.
We offer them help.
Even your own kid OD'd.
Yes.
Is that why you're here?
Hey, wise guy.
I'm here to talk to you about Tom Lopez.
Did you know he was a cop?
Yes.
He's also a volunteer on staff.
He teaches boxing.
- Coaches our Golden Gloves.
- Not anymore.
He killed himself an hour ago.
- I'm shocked.
- I bet you are.
Is this kid here, Louis Montana, part of your drug rehabilitation program?
He was.
He ran away last week.
- Did you see him after he ran away?
- No.
- Did Lopez know him?
- He coached him.
You saw them together?
Yes, why?
We found Louis Montana's body on a Hudson River barge yesterday.
- Would you know anything about that?
- Certainly not.
You have a right to remain silent.
Anything you say can be used against you.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you can't afford one, we'll provide one.
Is that clear?
You!
Get out of here!
Fuck off.
You know what I'd like to do?
I'd like to put this monkey on a grill and fry his ass until I get some answers about this Santería bullshit from you people.
That's my number at the precinct.
Call me tomorrow.
Don't forget.
He hasn't slept for two days.
If you're not a cop, what are you?
I'm a therapist.
Tom Lopez is one of my patients.
I'm really very sorry about all this.
Do you really think we are savages?
That we are capable of killing children?
You said in your book that human sacrifice was practiced at one time.
Name one religion where atrocities have not been committed in the name of a god.
Santería is a force for good.
It is not a blood-cult trading on innocent lives!
- What are you people so afraid of?
- Of your ignorance.
Of your prejudice, because you use it as a weapon against us.
Tom Lopez was a good and decent man.
He was devoted to these children.
I don't believe he committed suicide or had anything to do with that outrage!
Neither do I.
Robert Calder is the chairman of your board?
Yes.
He's our major contributor.
- He's not into Santería?
- No.
Did Lopez know him?
We all do.
He organizes our fundraisers.
This says there's a fundraiser this week.
Could you arrange for me to go?
Yes.
- Dad, can we stop by the church?
- Why?
I want to light a candle for Mom.
This is chekete.
I'd prefer a vodka tonic.
I'm afraid this is all we are serving.
It's traditional.
It is also traditional to sip it slowly.
I can see that.
Our host.
Excuse me.
Robert Calder.
Quite a guy.
- What do you know about him?
- Not much.
Self-made man.
He turned one midtown-building share into a fortune.
Now he's into everything.
Money markets, energy, the whole bit.
The person I spoke to you about would like to meet you.
May I introduce Dr. Cal Jamison?
How do you do, sir.
- My friend, Jessica Halliday.
- Hello.
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Jennifer, Mr. Calder's assistant.
Oscar's told me of your interest.
A friend told me about your organization.
I'm very impressed.
- You are the sort of man we want.
- Really?
I believe you knew my friend.
Officer Tom Lopez.
Terrible tragedy.
Did you know him well?
Not as well as I wanted to.
I suppose none of us did.
We always wish we'd known someone better when they die unexpectedly.
I lost my only son five years ago.
Drug overdose.
I live with that every day.
It tests one's faith, doesn't it?
It can also help you find it.
Are you a religious man?
Yes and no.
Sign of the times.
The representative from the mayor's office is here.
I hope we can work together.
It was a pleasure.
Pleasure meeting you, Mr. Calder.
- Bob.
- Bob.
Goodbye.
Would you like a cigar?
No, thanks.
I'm trying to cut down.
- Smoke attracts the gods.
- It makes them want to join the party.
How about that?
I'm gonna go pee.
I'll be right back.
- Did they show you a warrant?
- They did.
How could anybody think that anybody in our organization could do something so monstrous?
Clearly they made a mistake.
- Let the lawyers handle it.
- I tell you if all the good work we've done is destroyed by this...
That's not gonna happen, you have my word on that.
What is the detective's name?
McTaggert.
Lt. McTaggert.
I don't want you to worry about this.
We are proud to present the chairman of our board, Mr. Robert Calder.
Thank you.
On behalf of the A.C.H.E. Program I'm especially proud to say that thanks to your generous contributions during our sixth year A.C.H.E. Program offices will be opening in Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami and Washington, D.C.
I have a check here for $50,000.
Now, this is a personal check.
Don't worry, I'm good for it.
My challenge to you tonight is that collectively we top the contributions that were made last year.
Our helpers will be moving amongst you.
The next hand you feel in your pocket may not be your own.
We'd like to collect $425,111 from this room!
Now I know you're up to it.
I have faith!
And remember, it's still tax deductible.
Thank you.
What should we do?
Don't touch him!
He's not one of us!
Go!
What the hell are you doing?
Stop it!
Get away from him!
Get out!
Stay with him!
I warned you about this.
You're fired!
Get out!
You don't understand!
You don't understand!
You're fired!
He's in danger!
I'm trying to protect him!
The kid is hysterical!
Get out!
I don't want to hear!
Let me finish doing this!
You are finished!
Go!
- You don't know what you're doing!
- I know exactly what I'm doing!
My God, you're killing me!
If I see you around here again, I'll call the police.
Is that clear enough?
- What's the matter with you guys?
- It won't happen again.
It happens all the time!
Do me a favor.
Keep the greens on the desk, not in the box!
You always say, "I'm sorry"!
Get your act together!
Cal.
- How are you doing?
- Lieutenant?
Is this a bad time?
It's always a bad time around here.
Let's go.
- What's up?
- What's in here.
Sezine's story on his son checks out.
Autopsy confirms the kid OD'd.
That's what I expected.
What about the Calder boy?
Same thing.
Overdose five years ago.
Five years ago, this boy was 8 years old.
8-year-olds don't usually OD.
- Where's the autopsy report?
- I can't find it.
Are you serious?
Nobody knows where it is.
Are you saying you lost it, or somebody doesn't want it found?
Listen.
We're dropping this investigation.
We're laying the murders on Lopez.
Lopez didn't kill anybody but himself.
Where is this coming from?
Lopez is dead.
We got him tied to the kids.
He took his life out of his own guilt.
We got enough to close now!
Who the hell do you think you're kidding?
You want me to show you?
Come here.
You didn't see this.
Culebras.
- Sorry we're late.
- No problem.
We're all set.
All right.
All aboard.
Plenty of good seats still available.
Tickets please.
I have my ticket.
Now listen, be a good boy.
I'll be out in a couple of days and we'll go to Santa Fe to see your grandparents.
- I'm going to go sailing.
- Sailing?
I fully expect you to be captain of the ship, Mr. Christopher.
I'll call tomorrow and you'll tell me all about it.
I love you, Dad.
I love you, too.
Have a great time, kiddo.
- All ashore that's going ashore.
- Come along, matey, here we go!
Watch your feet.
- Don't worry about anything.
- Thanks.
See you both Friday.
I have a glorious dinner planned.
- See you.
- Bye, Dad.
Why would my housekeeper take it from my son?
Is it Santería?
No, this is not Santería.
It is black magic.
Brujería.
This symbol belongs to a god of destruction and pestilence El engaסador, the trickster.
What does it have to do with my son?
There was a ritual when a tribe was threatened by drought, flood or destruction by its enemies.
Three children were offered to the god.
Sacrificed?
Elder sons sacrificed by their fathers.
- The last child, at summer solstice.
- Why?
To gain power, to destroy their enemies.
I've seen the bodies of two children.
This ritual is being performed now.
Was Carmen involved?
No, I believe she tried to cast a spell of protection.
She was not strong enough.
It was turned against her.
Protection from what?
You both felt the power of the man who killed Tom Lopez and those two children.
I'm sure of it.
You looked into his eyes.
Did Calder bring that man here?
I believe that's what Lopez was trying to tell you.
What can I do?
Please, tell me.
The summer solstice is on June 21st.
Four days away.
You must seek protection for your son and for yourself.
I'd need a priest, a Santero.
I am a Santero.
You must trust me and do as I say.
- We shouldn't be doing this.
- You don't have to stay.
- I think we should both leave, right now.
- No.
This doesn't feel right.
- Cal, please!
- I don't know what else to do.
Please kneel.
Water to purify.
May your enemies never see what we are doing here.
Stand up.
Offer the blood for your son's life.
- Here's one.
- Another one?
This kid runs home from school with a brown package under his arm.
He says, "Mom, look what I found..."
Hold on a second.
Detective Connolly. 2-7 squad.
This is Dr. Jamison.
Lt. Mc Taggert, please.
Sorry, Doctor.
He's out sick.
The flu's making its rounds.
I'll call his home.
Thanks.
Why don't you come with us?
I am.
I mean to Santa Fe, too.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
This could get serious, you know?
I hope so.
- Hello?
- It's Cal.
- Darling, how are you?
- I'm fine.
How are you?
- Just great.
- How's the weather?
It's fabulous, and the forecast is even better.
Great.
Is Chris behaving himself?
He's a delight.
I'd forgotten about 8-year-olds.
He's run me half ragged.
I know.
I guess I'm used to it.
Can I talk to him?
He's out in the boat with Dennis right now.
- I'll give him a big hug.
- Please do that for me.
- Will we see you here this evening?
- Of course.
That's wonderful.
We have the whole weekend planned.
- We're looking forward to it.
- All right.
See you later, dear.
- See you later.
- Drive carefully.
- We will.
- Kisses.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
You all right?
I'm okay, just really tired.
You don't sound okay.
I'm coming over.
No.
Really.
I just think I need some more sleep.
I can call Kate and Dennis and say we'll be out in the morning.
- No, go ahead.
- You sure?
Yes.
Call me when you get there.
Give Chris my love.
Okay, I will.
Take care.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Cal?
Shit.
No one's here right now, but if you leave your name and...
Hello.
- Who is this?
- It's Mc Taggert.
- Lieutenant.
- My apartment.
Got to see you.
- What's wrong?
- Just get over here!
Do it!
Wait a second.
McTaggert?
Who is it?
It's me, Cal.
Shut the door.
Step into the light.
I want to see your face.
What's going on?
You don't need the gun.
Like hell I don't.
I saw them.
They're out there.
There's nobody out there.
You goddamn liar!
No, Sean, I swear to you.
I came alone.
I'm here to help you.
Open that.
What is it?
Calder's son.
It wasn't an overdose.
He killed his own fucking son.
Where did you get this?
Buried files.
They didn't think I knew where to find them, but I did.
They're out there now, watching.
Go on.
You answer it.
Hello.
See?
You believe me now?
Why haven't they done anything to you?
What have they done to you?
I can't move.
"My God, I am heartily sorry...
"...for having offended Thee.
"And I detest...
"...all my sins...
"...because of Thy just punishments.
"But most of all because they offend Thee, my God...
"...who art all good, and worthy of all my love.
"I firmly resolve..."
Everything's going to be all right now.
Take the gun.
Kill him.
The police won't help you.
He'll get to anybody.
Do it yourself, please, I'm begging you.
Go.
Okay.
Destroy Calder.
God help you.
"I firmly resolve...
"...with the help of Thy grace, to sin no more."
Yeah, hello.
Marty, I've got something important I want you to keep for me.
Sure.
You okay?
Jessica!
I'll call you right back!
- Vital signs?
- BP: 80 over 60.
Pulse: 140.
Respiration: 30 and shallow.
Wait outside, please.
There's no one here to take your call.
But if you leave your name and number, I'll get back to you.
Please speak after the beep.
It's Kate.
If you hear this, do not call me.
Change of plans.
Please, God, what have I done?
Cal, I'm bringing Chris.
Will explain all when I see you.
Meet me, Flanders Inn...
Hello?
Marty, make sure they take care of her till I get back.
I will!
She's covered.
I told everyone at the hospital I'm a lawyer.
They're not idiots.
Relax.
Get some sleep.
- Can you find your way back?
- No problem.
Keep this for me.
Thanks for everything.
I'll see you.
The prodigal son returns!
- Hey, guys, I'm sorry.
- Not a word of it.
Come in.
Kate's gone to her all-night market.
She never thinks we have enough food.
- Last door on the end.
- Okay.
- Thank you, Dennis.
- Not at all.
- Hell of a week for you.
- A hell of a year.
That's true.
It is hell, isn't it?
There's no point in denying it.
The kind of loss you suffered, the grief, it's dreadful.
But what can you do?
Be a man about it.
That's what you've done.
You just go on!
And then one day you wake up and it's just the slightest bit better.
That's the way it changes, little by little small increments.
That's the way it was with us.
We thought we'd never get over it.
But you do.
When was that?
Kate's fieldwork.
Post-graduate.
Summer of '46.
The Sudan. 11 months in the bush.
Haven't I ever told you this story?
No.
Worst drought in 50 years.
Then cholera.
We saw half the tribe decimated.
Daniel was only 4 years old.
I'd argued against bringing him, but Kate insisted.
She couldn't bear to leave him that long.
Then, when Daniel took sick the elders of the tribe came to see us.
We'd developed a trust with them by then.
A bond.
What they suggested seemed unthinkable, against nature.
But you see Daniel was so clearly beyond any medical help and as outsiders, it was a great honor.
Daniel was very brave.
And the drought did end.
We were delivered.
The life of another child was saved.
A most remarkable child.
Over the years, he's grown so special to us, almost like a son.
He's taught us so much.
Of course, you're uncertain, naturally.
So was I until I met him.
Now imagine, if you can a life without uncertainty.
Freedom from doubt.
The ability to choose.
Single-mindedness.
One life from each of us is all he asks.
He rewards our devotion a thousandfold.
Personal desires?
Yes, of course.
Anything.
- That's part of it.
- It's only the beginning.
There was a time when man was at one with the gods, before the Fall.
Now we're at one again and their benediction is power.
It's a power you can't imagine.
Power to create a world of our choosing.
Power to destroy those who oppose us.
Chris was chosen.
When he found the shell, remember?
It was a sign.
We want you to join us!
It must be the father.
"We consecrate this ground...
"...with this father's humble offering.
"We seek the strength and wisdom...
"...of our benefactors.
"We call upon the ancient gods to renew our strength.
"Guide your hand to strike down the enemies of our faith and this nation.
"We welcome our brother, Cal...
"...reborn into your grace.
"Restore nature's order.
"The power, which is our birthright.
"The glory, which is our destiny.
"Our enemies consumed by rings of fire.
"Our strength reborn...
"...in sacrifice!"
Do you believe?
Yes, I do believe.
Dad?
"Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater Had a wife and couldn't keep her..."
- You okay?
- I'm all right!
Where is he?
Fucking maniacs!
Who are these guys?
They jumped in the elevator.
They took him up.
I'll take this one.
Dad!
Let me go!
Goddamn.
God gave His only begotten son.
Let him go!
Remember that?
It is God's will that innocence redeem the world.
We give our sons to war in the name of peace!
Sacrifice our families to false gods, ambition, lust, pride!
It's hypocrisy!
This is all lies.
I was a slave, I had no life!
You have no life!
God gives you life!
You give them innocence the gods give you life.
And your son was innocent, wasn't he?
Peter, that was your son's name, wasn't it?
And you sacrificed your son to the gods, didn't you?
That was my salvation.
I was reborn.
It must have taken great strength and great courage.
Tell me.
He looked into my eyes.
He forgave me Peter.
He understood.
I'm over here.
Come to me.
No.
You come to me.
Let's go, boy.
Hey Bean, how's it going?
- Hey, Dad.
Got the barbecue sauce?
- Sure do.
Let's go easy on it this time.
Don't you look beautiful.
- I'm glad you're home.
- Me, too.
- Be careful with that, Chris.
- All right, Mom.
It'll keep.
Maybe it won't!
Chris, that looks terrific.
You don't need my help at all.
What is it, boy?
Easy!
What's wrong, boy?
Anybody up there?
All right, out!
I did it for us.
We'll be safe now.

Oh, it is too early for "Knock, knock." Now, come on, eat up.
We're running late.

Chris, give me a break!
Does it have to be World War II this morning?
(IN MONOTONE) World War III.
Cute, kid.
LISA: 8:30, Cal!
- Why didn't you tell me it was so late?
- I just did.
- Dad?
- What?
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?
- Dwayne.
- Dwayne who?
Dwayne the bathtub, I'm dwowning!
That's terrible!
That's not my lunch, is it?
Well, not now, it isn't.
- When did your friends leave this morning?
- Oh, I thought they were your friends.
Well, they left about 3:00.
You used to be able to go all night.
Yeah, I know, but I can't do it anymore.
What can't you do anymore?
CAL AND LISA:
Eat your breakfast.
Do you think they would have taken the hint if I had served the last drink in my pajamas?
LISA:
Come on, kiddo.
Shoes and socks on.
Let's go.
Come on.
CAL:
Oh, shit.
LISA:
Oh, great.
- Terrific, Cal.
- I got it.
No, no, not the socks!
(SIGHING)
- Hit the showers.
- Right.

And be careful from the walls.
Mrs. Hallidayjust painted them.
Follow me, okay?
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
CAL:
You did what anyone would have done.
FRANK:
It happened so fast.
I just reacted.
He was trying to help.
Christ, the man's got four kids!
Don't you think you'll be more effective when you do go back out there, if you begin to forgive yourself?
That's what this is all about, Frank.
That's how I can help you, if you'll let me.
Yeah.
Yeah, I want to.
It's...
I do.
It's, uh...
Good.
Well, I'd say we made a pretty good beginning, wouldn't you?
Yeah.
CAL:
I'll set you up for next week, then.
What have you got there, little guy?
- Chief Black Cloud.
- Yeah?
Are you sick?
I'm sorry.
- You can call me anytime.
- Right.
See you next Thursday.
Hopefully we'll be a little better settled in by then.
- Thank you, Doctor.
- You're welcome.
- Are you all right, Bean?
- Mmm-hmm.
Not so fast, my friend.
From now on, I don't think it's a good idea for you to play in here while Dad's working.
Is it a deal?
Okay.
What do we got here?
Flowers.
Mrs. Ruiz and I are gonna plant some for Mom.
Like these?
Mom wants me to.
Do you believe me?
I believe she would want you to.
Sure.
JESSICA:
Take it easy, you guys.
I just finished painting this place.
Oh, wait a moment.
No!
My wall!
My beautiful wall!
I finished this whole wall with my own hands and now it looks like my first apartment.
- Well, it's just a little gouge.
-It's a giant crater!
I'm gonna have to start from scratch!
Fill it, sand it!
-(GRUNTS)
- MAN 1:
All right, all right.
What's the problem?
This.
Now, 10 years ago, I wouldn't have minded.
But now I want a wall to look like a wall.
You know what I mean?
MAN 2:
I'm nearly finished.
Let me take a look at it.
- Oh, no, no, no.
You don't have to do that.
- It's okay.
I'm taking care of it.
Well, thank you very much.
That's great.
Who says chivalry is dead?
Alive and well in New York.
Amazing.
So, how does it feel to have your whole life stuffed in little boxes?
A little cramped.
Yeah.
Now, here's the number for the electrician.
He's expecting your call.
Painter's coming on Sunday, and I'll get to the kitchen faucet as soon as I can.
You gonna fix it yourself?
Sure.
I'm the landlady.
Hey, listen, I lost one of my earrings.
I think it might be in your apartment.
It's pretty hard to miss.
Then, it might be in my bag.
But if you see it, will you let me know?
I'll keep an eye out.
- Great.
How is Carmen working out?
- Just fine, thank you.
She's terrific with Chris.
Oh, shit!
The stream of cops through here is going to do wonders for my parking ticket situation.
Maybe I can put in a word for you downtown.
Listen, if there's anything else you need, I'm right across the street.
Hey, Officer?

MARTY'.
I told you never to call me here.
What do you want?
I'm a busy man.
Hi, buddy, how are you?
Great, great.
So, is that a great apartment or what, huh?
That I found for you all by myself?
And how about the landlady?
Not bad, huh?
Do you know what I had to do to get that?
Huh?
So, uh, by the way, where's my commission?
Hey, shut up already.
You done great.
It's wonderful.
No complaints.
- So where are you?
You're 15 minutes late.
- I'm in the park.
The park?
What are you doing in the park?
You're supposed to be here.
I'm on my way.
I've got Chris with me.
Oh, great, great.
- It's okay if I bring him?
- Oh, yeah, please.
Uh, okay.
See you soon, Marty.

I'm jogging.
I run here every day.
OFFICER:

WOMAN:
No, no one else was here.
Just me.
OFFICER:

WOMAN:
What?
That's all I saw...
OFFICER:
Please, calm down, Miss.
What were you doing here?
WOMAN:
What am I doing down...
I run here every day.
My girlfriend and I usually run.
Today, she had to go to the dentist.
I just want to take a bit of information from you, please.
Information?

- What kind of information?
- Like your name first, please.
- Oh, my name?

Come on, honey.
Okay, folks, the show is over!
Come on, it's a beautiful day,

Come on, start moving.
Come on, get out of here!
Let's go!
I said keep moving.

Where in the park?
Somewhere.
It's a wishing shell.
How do you know that?
I just do.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where is this guy?
Hey, there he is.
- Hi, Marty.
- Hey, Chris, how are you doing?
I've been waiting all morning for you, you know that?
- How are you, Marty?
- Who's this bum you're dragging around?
You know, you gotta watch these guys that hang out in the park.
-(EXCLAIMS) What's this?
- What?
Bubble gum?
Didn't your dad ever show you where to park your gum?
- Where?
- On the bedpost, for crying out loud.
Look, you got any questions about important stuff like this, you come ask your lawyer.
All right?
- Okay.
- Okay.
I ever show you this one?
Twice.
Okay, wise guy, you get them apart.
I'll bring him right back.
Promise.
Linda.
- Coffee?
- No.
One.
Regular.
Thanks.
(PHONE RINGING)
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.
We're in agreement, right?
So...
So, what's the problem?
I don't have any problem with the idea of a lawsuit, Marty.
The point is I don't want Chris to have to relive it all.
Neither do I.
But that coffee machine was fuckin' defective and we gotta nail the bastards so no one else gets killed.
So long as Chris doesn't have to testify.
I mean it, Marty.
- I feel very strongly about this.
- You and me both.
Look, this will not go to trial.
I promise you.
They'd be crazy.
They'll settle.
Do you smoke?
No, thanks, I quit.
Yeah, me, too.
I quit at least twice this week already.
Thanks.
I love Chris, you know that.
He's a great kid.
Tell you the truth, he's not the one I'm worried about.
- I'm all right.
- That's it? "I'm all right"?
You spend your time listening to these cops' problems, you can't even talk about your own?
(SIGHS)
It's lonely.
Yeah?
I'm trying to pick up the pieces.
Yeah.
It really feels strange being back.
Oh, the city's changed a lot.
Yeah, some days I'm not so sure it was a good idea to bring Chris here.
But in a funny way, it's brought us closer together.
If you need anything, anything at all, I'm there before you hang up the phone.
- You know that.
- I know.
-I feel better.
You feel better?

That's a useless knife.

Dennis, look.

Oh.

You seem pretty sure about that.
Yep.
It's a beautiful piece of work.
Have you seen this, Kate?
Yes.
You still got that thing, Chris?
That's his wishing shell.

What do you suppose you could make out of this?
I don't know.
What about a necklace?

DENNIS:
About 40 degrees below zero.
They had fires inside the tent.
It must have been 70 degrees below, with the wind chill.
It was quite a day, wasn't it?

- Hello?
- MCTAGGERT:
Is this Dr. Jamison?
Speaking.
Good.
This is Lieutenant McTaggert, 27th Precinct.
What can I do for you, Lieutenant?
It's a hell of a way to start your Sunday, but I got your number from Psych Services.
I'm at Bellevue, and we got an officer in a lot of trouble down here.
You want me to come down now?
I'd appreciate that.
It's McTaggert, and I'll be waiting for you at Psychiatric Emergency.
- All right, give me about 20 minutes, okay?
-Thank you.
CAL:
I understand you were working undercover on the disappearance of some kids in Spanish Harlem.
Isn't that right, Tom?
May I call you Tom?
Are you Catholic?
Yes, I am.
I'm not a practicing Catholic.
They know who I am!
Who are "they," Tom?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
How do I know about you?
All right, I understand.
You have no reason to trust me yet.
But you don't have any reason to distrust me, do you?
The spirits help them.
They walk through walls.
- Don't forget that.
- I won't.
And they can see us in here right now, is that it?
What is it?
Easy.
They knew that I was on to them.
I walked in and they were waiting for me.
- Can you identify them?
- No.
When I came to, I found the body.
They got my shield.
Don't you get it?
Yes.
Oh, they're going to kill me.
No,no,no.
- I can feel it's started already.
- No, no.
Nobody can harm you in here.
I promise you that.
God can't save you.
The church can't save you.
They get right inside your body!
You can't stop them.
Seven powers.
You...
You think that you can stop them?
You think science can stop them?
(CRYING)
- Oh, dear God...
- It's all right.
It's all right.
The eyes.
I saw his eyes!
Whose eyes, Tom?
Whose eyes?
They can get to anyone.
They can kill anybody!
You want them to know who you are?
DO you?
What do you think, is he gonna come out of it?
I don't know.
I need more time with him.
- He was one of my best guys.
- Maybe I should see the victim.
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.
It's the kid's parents.
Jesus.
What kind of a monster does that?
Been down the freezer again, eh, Lieutenant?
You're a real comedian, Rob.
Don't be a stranger.
Hit me again.
No, thank you.
Just coffee, please.
So, did we treat cops for alcohol abuse back in, where was it?
Milwaukee?
Minneapolis.
Oh, Minneapolis.
What the hell brought you to New York?
You don't mind my asking?
No, I went to graduate school at Columbia.
Uh, nice school, shitty neighborhood.
You got a family?
I have a son.
Thank you.
I lost my wife recently.
I'm sorry to hear that.
So what did Lopez have on this?
Nada.
Nothing.
Can I see his reports?
No.
Why not?
- They're not available.
- Hope you're off duty, Lieutenant.
Fuck off.
Is Lopez Catholic?
Yeah, sure.
The family is Cuban.
They practice this thing called Santeria.
- Ever hear of that?
- No.
It's a Latin thing.
A lot of them are into it up there.
They cut up chickens, magic, shit like that.
- And Lopez is into this?
- Yeah.
He kept it quiet, but...
You said he found the body on an altar, with a lot of religious paraphernalia, right?
There's at least 200 places sell that shit, East Island alone.
Wait a second, please.
If I'm evaluating a patient,
I'd call that a pretty strong lead.
Wouldn't you?
A citizen's got a right to his own religious preference.
That's the First Amendment.
If a citizen performs a human sacrifice, I'd say he forfeits that right.
Come on.
A psycho kills a kid, he makes it look like a religious ritual.
That kid was cut up with the precision of a surgeon, not a psychopath.
What are you afraid of, that Lopez is a suspect?
That it's one of your own?
It's not this religion, is it?
I don't call cutting up chickens a religion!
Maybe if you spent as much time in a barrio as I have, you wouldn't ask such dumb questions.
That's bullshit.
Just one last question, Lieutenant.
Is this all the assistance I'm gonna get trying to help that officer?
Think about it.
Thanks for the coffee.

When was that?

Just you.

You're in danger.
You and your son.

We're supposed to be working together.

OFFICER:
Did you know him?

No.
I don't.

What'd he tell you when he called?
Nothing.
He just told me to meet him.
OFFICER:
Did you understand anything he was saying?
Yes.
He kept saying, "Culebras!
Culebras!"
Who the hell is Culebras?
Nobody, sir.
That means "snakes."
Snakes?
Uh, did he, uh...
Did he do anything else before he started screaming?
MAN:
Yes.
He was writing, and then he took the knife and stabbed himself.

Where did he get the knife?

I was using it.

Come on, get in here.
I wanna talk to you.
Who is this guy?
A friend of yours?
What the hell is this place supposed to be, anyway?
This is a licensed drug rehab center, huh?
Our doors are open to any troubled children.
We offer them help, assistance...
Yeah, yeah, I know that.
Even your own kid OD'd, huh?
Yes.
Does that have anything to do with why you're here?
Hey, wise guy-
I'm here to talk to you about Tom Lopez.
Did you know he was a cop?
Yes.
He's also a volunteer on staff.
He teaches boxing.
Coaches our Golden Gloves.
MCTAGGERT:
No, not anymore, he doesn't.
He killed himself about an hour ago.
OSCAR:
I'm shocked.
MCTAGGERT:
I bet you are.
This kid here, Louis Montana, is he part of your drug rehabilitation program?
He was.
He ran away last week.
Is that right?
And did you see him after he ran away?
No.
- Did Tom Lopez know him?
- Yes, I believe he coached him.
Then he knew him.
You saw them together?
Yes, Why?
We found Louis Montana's body on a barge in the Hudson River yesterday.
Now, you wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you, Mr. Sezine?
Certainly not.
Mr. Sezine, you have a right to remain silent.
Anything you say could be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney and if you can't afford one, we'll provide one for you.
Is that clear?
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
Hey, you!
Get the hell out of here!
Go on!
Get out!

You know what I'd really like to do?
I'd like to put this monkey on a grill and fry his ass until I get some straight fucking answers about this Santeria bullshit from you people.
That's my card.
Number at the precinct.
You call me tomorrow between 10:00 and 11:00.
Don't forget.
CAL:
He hasn't slept for two days.
If you're not a cop, what are you?
I'm a therapist.
Tom Lopez is one of my patients.
I'm really very sorry about all this.
My God, do you really think we are savages?
That we'd be capable of killing children?
You said in your book that human sacrifice was practiced at one time.
Name me one religion where atrocities have not been committed in the name of a god.
Santeria is a force for good.
It is not a blood-cult trading on innocent lives!
- Then what are you people so afraid of?
- Of your ignorance.
Of your prejudice, because you use it as a weapon against us.
Tom Lopez was a good and decent man.
He was devoted to these children.
I don't believe he committed suicide.
I don't believe he had anything to do with that outrage!
Neither do I.
Robert Calder is the chairman of your board?
Yes.
He's our major contributor.
- He's not into Santeria?
- No.
Did Lopez know him?
We all do.
He organizes our fundraisers.
Yeah, it says here there's a fundraiser later on this week.
Could you arrange for me to go?
Yes.

Well, actually, a friend of mine told me about your organization.
I'm very impressed.
Well, you're the sort of man we're looking for.
Really?
I understand you knew my friend.
Officer Tom Lopez.
Terrible tragedy.
Did you know him well?
Not as well as I would have liked, no.
No, I suppose none of us did.
We always wish we'd known someone better when they're taken from us unexpectedly.
I lost my only son five years ago.
Drug overdose.
I live with that every day.
It tests one's faith, doesn't it?
It can also help you find it.

Hey, Cal.
- How are you doing?
- Lieutenant?
Is this a bad time?
It's always a bad time around here.
Let's go.
- What's up?
- What's in here.
Sezine's story on his son checks out.
Autopsy confirms the kid OD'd.
That's what I expected.
What about the Calder boy?
Same thing.
Overdose five years ago.
Five years ago, this boy was 8 years old.
8-year-olds don't usually OD.
- Where's the autopsy report?
- I don't know.
I...
I can't find it.
Are you serious?
Nobody knows where it is.
Are you saying you lost it, or somebody doesn't want it found?
Listen.
We're dropping this investigation now.
We're laying the murders off on Lopez.
Lopez didn't kill anybody but himself and you know it.
Where is this coming from?
Lopez is dead.
We got him tied to the kids.
He took his life out of his own guilt.
We got enough to close now!

CAL:
Why would my housekeeper take it from my son?
Is it Santeria?
No, this is not Santeria.
It is black magic, brujeria.
This symbol belongs to a god of destruction and pestilence,
El engafiador, the trickster.
What the hell does it have to do with my son?
There was, uh, a ritual when a tribe was threatened by drought, flood or destruction by its enemies.
Three children were offered to the god.
JESSICA:
Sacrificed?
Elder sons sacrificed by their fathers.
- The last child, at summer solstice.
- JESSICA:
Why?
To gain power, to destroy their enemies.
I've seen the bodies of two children.
This ritual is being performed now.
Was Carmen involved?
No, I believe she tried to cast a spell of protection.
She was not strong enough.
It was turned against her.
Protection from what?
Look.
You both felt the power of the man who killed Tom Lopez and those two children.
I'm sure of it.
You looked into his eyes.
Did Calder bring that man here?
I believe that's what Lopez was trying to tell you.
What can I do?
Please, tell me what I can do.
The summer solstice is on June 21st.
Four days away.
You must seek protection for your son and for yourself.
I'd need a priest, a santero.
I am a santero.
And you must trust me and do as I say.
- Cal, we shouldn't be doing this.
- You don't have to stay.
- I think we should both leave, right now.

The kind of loss you suffered, that kind of grief, it's dreadful.
But what can you do?
Be a man about it.
That's what you've done.
You just go on!
And then one day, you wake up and it's just the slightest bit better.
That's the way it changes, little by little, small increments.
Well, that's the way it was with us.
We thought we'd never get over it.
But you do.
When was that?
Kate's fieldwork.
Post-graduate.
Summer of '46.
The Sudan. 11 months in the bush.
Haven't I ever told you this story?
No.
Worst drought in 50 years.
Then cholera.
We saw half the tribe decimated.
Daniel was only four years old.
Oh, I'd argued against bringing him, but Kate insisted.
She couldn't bear to leave him that long.
Then, when Daniel took sick, the elders of the tribe came to see us.
We'd developed a trust with them by then.
A bond.
What they suggested seemed unthinkable, against nature.
But you see, Cal,
(DISTORTED) Daniel was so clearly beyond any medical help.
As outsiders, it was really a great honor.
Daniel was very brave.
And the drought did end, Cal.
We were delivered.
The life of another child was saved.
A most remarkable child, Cal.
Over the years, he's grown so special to us, almost like a son.
He's taught us so much.
(DISTORTED) Of course, you're uncertain, Cal, naturally.
So was I until I met him.
Now imagine, if you can, a life without uncertainty.
Freedom from doubt.
The ability to choose.
Single-mindedness.
One life from each of us, Cal, is all he asks.
And he rewards our devotion a thousand fold.
Personal desires?
Oh, yes, of course.
Anything.
- That's part of it.
-It's only the beginning.
CALDER:
There was a time, Cal, when man was at one with the gods, before the Fall.
Now we're at one again and their benediction is power.
It's a power you can't imagine.
Power to create a world of our choosing.
Power to destroy those who oppose us.

And you sacrificed your son to the gods, didn't you?
That was my salvation.
I was reborn.
It must have taken great strength and great courage.
Tell me.
He looked into my eyes.
Dad?
He forgave me.
Peter.
He understood.
(CLATTERING)
CALDER:
No.
(CRASHING)
(GRUNTING)
(CHOKING)
Chris?
I'm over here.
Come to me.
No.
You come to me.
(SCREAMS)
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
Let's go, boy.
Hey, Bean, how's it going?
- Hey, Dad.
Got the barbecue sauce?
- Sure do.
- Let's go easy on it this time.
- Oh.
Hey, don't you look beautiful.
- I'm glad you're home.
- Me, too.
- Be careful with that, Chris.
- All right, Mom.
(CHRIS HUMMING)
(SINGING)
CHRIS:
Mom?
No, no.
It'll keep.
-(MOANING)
- CHRIS:
Mom?
Maybe it won't!
JESSICA:
Hey, Chris, that looks terrific.
You don't need my help at all.
Don't burn yourself.
(DOG BARKING)
(DOG GROWLING)
What is it, boy?
What is it?
Easy, fella.
(HENS CLUCKING)
(WHINING)
(YELPING)
What's wrong, boy?
What is it?
Anybody up there?
All right, out!
(FLIES BUZZING)
(HAY RUSTLING)
I did it for us.
We'll be safe now.

Ah!
Quackaroonie!
This is Frisbee-flinging weather if I ever saw it.
Well, according to Mrs. Quackenbush, it's homework weather.
And we gotta have a report on gravity to drop on her by tomorrow morning.
Well, what better way to study gravity than by seeing how long our Frisbees can stay up in the air!
- Now that's our kind of homework.
- Oh, yeah!
[Wind howling]
[Thunderclap]
[Sighs] It never fails to rain right after one buffs one's limousine.
Well, the Frisbee match is rained out.
We might as well do our homework.
Right after Flash Mallard conquers the universe!
- [Explosion]
- Yay!
[Man on TV] Blast off with Ducks of the Galaxy!
[Nephews] Hooray!
You are Flash Mallard, hero of the cosmos.
Naturally.
Fighting evil Commander Gander to save your universe, your galaxy and your neighborhood!
It's a tough job, but somebody's gotta do it.
[Growling]
If I didn't know better, I'd say the limo was growling at me.
[Growling]
But then what do I know?
!
[Duckworth howls]
[Growling]
Boy, I'd hate to meet up with him on a dark planet.
Yeah, you said it.
- [Thunderclap] - [All howl]
I'm afraid I jumped straight to level 12.
- There is no level 12.
- That's what I'm afraid of!
What great special effects.
I hope we don't get blamed for this.
[All scream]
Old Flash went flash!
I think that means he lost.
Correction.
You all lost.
[All scream]
The Ducks of the Galaxy have landed!
I'm gonna conquer your puny little planet, starting with this puny little mansion.
[Cackling]
- I'm eating in the rain
- Just eating in the rain...
What do you know?
- I'm eating again...
Wait!
Stop!
Don't do it!
Who said that?
P...
P...
Please, don't eat me.
Or I'll eat you!
[Snarling]
[Gasping] I'll never eat three banana splits in one day again, I promise!
You'll never eat anything again.
[Screaming]
I'm gonna turn you into a banana split.
With what kind of ice cream?
[Banana snarls]
[Screaming]
Are you hiding from Commander Gander?
No, I'm hiding from a big banana.
Oh, bother.
You're full up.
I'll be hiding in Mr. McDuck's closet if anyone is looking for me.
Unless, of course, the limo is looking for me.
[Growling]
No!
Make that the hall closet.
It was sunny at the bank.
But then it's always sunny where there's money. [laughing]
Ah, well, a stormy day makes me appreciate the warmth and security of a happy home.
I wonder where Duckworth is.
- Good afternoon, sir.
- There you are.
Duckworth, why are you standing in the closet?
[Clears throat] Because there's no limo monster in here, sir.
I guess he's got a point.
Limo monster?
[Nephew] Uncle Scrooge?
Is that you?
Well, of course it's me.
Who else would it be?
[All sigh]
I was afraid you were a big banana.
Or Commander Gander, terror of the universe.
Or the limo monster.
Not last time I checked.
No, I'm just a plain, old, filthy-rich duck who wants to know what's going on around here!
Come on, we'll show you, Uncle Scrooge.
[Snarling]
Commander Gander must be hiding in our room, Uncle Scrooge.
Waiting to destroy our puny little planet, permanently.
Aw, pshaw, lads.
Pshaw.
[Gasps] I don't believe it.
I knew it!
He's in there!
Run!
You better run.
You left your television on again.
My electric bill has been shocking.
Quackaroonie!
There's nothing here but our usual roomful of junk.
What happened to Commander Gander?
He was probably scared off by the big banana.
[Sighs]
Come on, Mr. McDuck.
If anyone can scare it away, you can.
But it was right here, Mr. McDuck.
It was mean and yellow,
- and almost too big to eat.
- There, there, Doofus.
The mind can play funny tricks on you, especially a mind like yours.
I guess you're right, Mr. McDuck.
Can I have something to eat?
You're welcome to eat anything in the kitchen that doesn't eat you first.
Oh, boy!
Ah, well, who can explain the overactive imaginations of kids?
[Doorbell rings]
I'm coming, I'm coming!
[Chuckling] I hope it's not a big banana, or a limo monster.
Or... [gasps]
Bill collectors.
- Pay, pay!
- Payment overdue!
- Two months late!
- Pay up!
- Your account is overdrawn!
- Check bounced!
- Credit's been canceled!
- [All] Pay, pay, pay!
[Howls]
- Open the door or your wallet!
- We own you, McDuck!
- And everything you have.
- It's like a nightmare coming true.
- Good afternoon once again, sir.
- They're after me, Duckworth!
I take it you don't want me to answer the door then.
- No!
- Uncle Scrooge?
- Are you in there?
- [Scrooge] No, I'm not.
Go away!
- But it's just us, Uncle Scrooge.
- Your loving nephews.
And your favorite neighbor.
Oh, uh,
- I don't owe you money, do I?
- Of course not.
- What happened to those collectors?
- What bill collectors?
Boys, something strange is going on here.
[Thunderclap]
[Woman cackling]
All you'll be finding are your worst fears.
And they're going to get worse and worse and worse!
I'm sorry I didn't believe you about Commander Gander.
- Or the big banana.
- What about the limo monster, sir?
- Don't push it, Duckworth.
- Very good, sir.
- We'll figure this out, Uncle Scrooge.
- Yeah!
Split up and snoop for clues.
- We'll look upstairs.
- I'll take the kitchen.
- I'll search the closet, sir.
- Very well, lads.
I'll search my study.
At the first sign of trouble, head for Duckworth's closet.
Oh, things could not be better.
Oh, I'm having such good time.
All your fears are coming true since my fear cloud rained on you.
There is nothing you can do!
So run and hide when I say, "Boo!"
[Boy] What are you looking for, barrel belly?
[Gasps]
- Larger underwear?
- Bully Beagle, the school bully!
Oh, no!
Please don't pick on me!
Worms like you were born to be picked on.
No, please, I'll do anything.
Anything!
- Give me your lunch money.
- No way!
Then I'm gonna wring your chubby little neck!
No!
[gasping]
The video game looks perfectly normal.
Unplug it anyway, just in case.
[Woman] Oh, boys, aren't you forgetting something?
Our teacher, Mrs. Quackenbush!
You didn't do your homework, boys.
And you know how I hate that.
[All scream]
Whose idea was it not to do our homework?
Yours!
Whose idea was it to listen to my idea?
Come out, you blasted bill collectors.
Nothing scares Scrooge McDuck.
- [Alarm blares] - [Howls]
My money bin alarm.
My poor money is in trouble.
[Both grunting]
Doofus, what are you doing?
Bully Beagle is making a fool of me.
And doing a good job of it too.
[Crying] I hate it when he picks on me.
So do I.
- Duckworth, get the limo!
- Oh, my apologies, sir.
But I wouldn't go near the limo if you paid me.
- I do pay you.
- Oh, is that what you call it?
Tell you what, sir.
I'll pay you a month's salary to drive yourself.
- A month's salary?
- Yes, sir.
- Yours or mine?
- Mine, sir.
Keep it.
- Uncle Scrooge, we found a clue!
- A really big clue.
- Our teacher, Mrs. Quackenbush, was...
- Fill me in on the way to the money.
[Nephew] That rain cloud, it's following us.
Stranger things have happened.
Most of them, earlier today.
- You boys stay here.
- We will, Uncle Scrooge.
With the doors locked.
[Howls]
It's gone!
My money is all gone.
[Cries]
What could be worse than this?
[People squabbling]
Pay up!
Pay up!
Pay up!
- With what?
- You're penniless, McDuck.
So we're gonna take your nephews away from you.
- Forever.
- No.
No!
- No!
- Come back here!
You'll never take my boys away from me.
Never.
Never!
Never!
[Whimpering] I was afraid this might happen someday.
Don't worry, boys.
I'll never let those bill collectors collect you.
What bill collectors?
[Gasps] The ones in the rear-view mirror.
[All gasp]
- That's not a bill collector!
- It's Mrs. Quackenbush, our teacher!
I'll teach you!
I'll teach you!
I'll teach you!
[cackling]
[Gasps] That's not Mrs. Quackenbush.
That's the school bully!
That's it, Doofus.
Hide behind your friends, if they're big enough.
[Cackling]
[Tires screeching]
The limo is pulling up, and I'm pulling out!
I'm sure there's an explanation for this, lads.
[All] Phew!
We...
We...
We cannot go on this way.
Yeah!
We gotta have something to eat.
We'll all stay together in your room tonight, boys.
- Can Doofus spend the night?
- Well, certainly.
I wouldn't send anyone out in that rain.
Who's afraid of the rain when there's a giant teacher to be afraid of?
Hmm, who indeed?
You boys finish your homework.
I'm going to call the weather service about this storm.
While you're at it, see what's keeping Doofus.
And tell him to save some for us.
You know, I've always been afraid Mrs. Quackenbush would really get mad at us
- if we didn't do our homework.
- Me too.
- That's why we're doing it.
- Well, I never told you guys before, but I've always been afraid of Commander Gander.
- I mean, really afraid of him.
- Same here.
- Who wouldn't be?
- It's almost as if someone knows what our worst fears are and is using them against us.
But who would know that much about us?
[Thud]
Uncle Scrooge!
Figured it out, did ya?
Well, my worst fears came true when I got you three little television leaver-on-ers.
I never wanted you here.
But that no-good Donald dumped you on me.
I've been doing all this to scare you out of my life.
But how could you do all those things?
I'm rich.
I can do anything.
And I'll be even richer when you're out of here.
- Uncle Scrooge!
- Uncle Scrooge!
[Scrooge] Don't call me that.
I don't want to be your uncle anymore.
I'm not all wet.
There's a storm cloud raining on my house this minute.
[Thunderclap]
See?
Lads, I'm certain that rain cloud has something to do with all this.
Figured it out, did ya?
Well, it's about time, you old fuddy-duddy!
We created that magic rain cloud with our Junior Woodchucks chemistry set.
Just to ruin your day.
This can't be happening.
- You wouldn't talk this way to me.
- Get with it, Uncle Fuddy-Duddy.
That goody-goody nephew stuff was all an act.
Yeah, just to get our hands on your dough!
Now get out and make more money, so we can keep mooching off ya.
Yeah!
That's all you're good for.
And that's all we're good for.
[Howling]
Here's a song for you, old fuddy-duddy.
- For he's a fuddy old geezer
- For he's a fuddy old geezer
- For he's a fuddy old geezer
- Which nobody really likes - [nephews laughing]
I knew it.
I knew it.
I was never cut out to raise three boys.
I've failed. [crying]
- [Nephews] Uncle Scrooge?
- Lads?
We're leaving, Uncle Scrooge, just like you wanted.
- Leaving?
- Yeah.
You still want to get rid of us, don't you?
Get rid of you?
Why, of course not.
You're the apples of my eye.
I thought you wanted to get rid of me.
You said I was an old fuddy-duddy.
We'd never say that, Uncle Scrooge.
Why, of course, you wouldn't.
[Thunderclap]
Lads, the things we've been seeing aren't real.
They must've been created through trickery or...
- Magic!
- Aye, aye.
And that spells...
Magica De Spell.
[Magica] Figured it out, did you?
[Cackles]
Lt'll do you no good.
Your greatest fears will continue to haunt you until you give me what I want!
My lucky dime?
All this was just to get my old number one?
Of course.
Now, hand it over, you old fuddy-duddy.
Or you will be running from your fears for the rest of your pathetic life!
With a little help from my magic fear cloud, of course.
We're gonna grow up to be some kind of troubled teenagers.
I won't let that happen.
We've been running from our fears long enough.
It's time to face them.
We're behind you, Uncle Scrooge.
Way behind.
Oh, yeah?
Well, face this!
[Growling]
I never did want you, and I don't want you now!
You're in big trouble, boys!
Scram, you old fuddy-duddy!
You cramp our style!
[Cackling] Run, Scrooge McDuck.
Run from your fears.
Run!
Run!
We mustn't run, lads, or we'll be running from our fears forever.
Face them, lads.
Show them who's boss.
Our fears can't control us if we don't let them.
Uh... we're not afraid of you, Mrs. Quackenbush!
- We did our homework!
- Oh, sorry.
And we know you're not Uncle Scrooge.
'Cause we'd never do this to him.
[Gasping]
[Nephew] Take off, Commander Gander.
You're only a video game.
That's the spirit, boys.
And as for you, you nasty little kilt-nippers, my boys love me, so you're not my boys.
[Cheering]
Oh!
You are thinking you're so smart.
Well, I'll be getting your lucky dime with another magic spell.
[Gasps]
My...
My magic spells!
They are turning against me!
My worst fear is coming true!
[Howling]
You deserve to get it in the end, you old fuddy-duddy!
- We did it, Uncle Scrooge!
- We won!
Aye, lads.
[Sighs] And from now on, we'll always face our fears, no matter how scary they are.
I was afraid you'd say that.
Only kidding, Uncle Scrooge.
Only kidding.
I do not know if you would come.
I almost did not come.
And I lost.
Everything seemed different.
I found myself more.
Do you drink?
It will do me good...
A white wine.
White wine?
I have more.
You want a beer?
This is as well.
I have had enough.
Maybe even too.
How did you escape?
My sister has problems with her husband.
I told Collin she wanted to see me.
At this hour?
This is a crisis.
And you, what did you say?
'Thanks for the evening.' Collin not deplore my absence.
This is your husband.
I'm just an employee.
I do not know what to say.
- Me neither.
I have never...
Why did you agree?
Because you wanted me...
And long.
It was so obvious?
- I could not ignore it.
And I'm at a point where I need to be desired.
Do not tell me you knew Collin.
If Collin knew.
You know.
What would he do if he knew?
I do not know.
I can not move.
Good.
I have to get up...
Will you excuse me?
Terry.
What?
What happened?
- He was trying to kill her.
Who?
It's okay?
He's gone.
He held her from behind.
He?
led to the street.
She has nothing.
Come on, we could see you.
He was trying to kill her.
I do not have immediately understood what was going on.
You saw him?
- His face was so white.
I must go.
- I'll come to your car.
How was it?
Twenty, twenty-four...
Incredibly white skin.
Roux, hair dominated.
You mean slicked?
I could be in his place.
You may have saved my life.
The pleasure was all mine.
I am willing to make you more services.
No.
I do not even want to think about it.
I'm afraid...
And I'm too retarded.
We might be in trouble.
Remorse?
None.
Despite what happened...
Perhaps because of that.
This is the most exciting night I remember...
And you?
- Remorse?
Are you kidding?
The Rough night?
- What do you mean?
You're late.
He?
asked you.
Good luck.
I want concrete on the site.
What I do not see my boys in jerking off.
What has happened last night?
Cope to get everything done.
The party?
Where have you been?
- I went home.
I saw you with my wife, then you disappeared.
What is it?
A gem, right?
He belonged to Bugsy Siegel.
Forty years... ever.
Where is he?
This is a friend... who provided me.
Hold.
Not bad, right?
It was well in hand.
It makes me want to use it.
Excuse me, the newspaper said.
The stock market is on the rise.
The body of a student found in a trash can.
Wooten What is the project?
This advance.
I will not return to this...
Do you mind?
- Make yourself at home.
What does it so interesting?
The heat wave is still rife.
I do not care news.
What do you say?
The girl says the newspaper?
Same place, same time...
This must be the man that you saw.
But another girl.
The victim is blonde.
The one you saw was brown.
This is terrifying.
The journal he speaks of witnesses?
There is none.
If this is the same man and if I'm the only witness.
I should report it to the police.
Tell them to hide your identity.
And if they refuse?
Everything will.
If I sent a letter?
- An anonymous letter?
They think that it is the work of a madman.
I want to do what to do.
The fact that I put the window have to shake my life?
This is unfair.
I am vile?
What are you doing?
The police, please.
I tell you what you saw, but I will say that it was me who saw it.
You can not do that.
This is the window of my room.
I can look at it, right?
I witnessed an assault.
They will make me a hero.
- But you tell lies.
I witnessed the assault a woman last night.
In front of me, almost statue of Washington.
12 place Mount Vernon...
Terry Lambert.
I have never seen anything more romantic.
This is to me that you did.
Can you describe it?
Describe to me.
- Grand... red hair.
Ears clear...
like that.
How was he dressed?
Beige Jacket...
Jeans...
Tennis Shoes.
Tennis or jogging shoes?
Tennis.
I'll make love to you like there you ever did.
I do not know if I have time, they arrive.
What happens?
Police...
An inspector.
He?
was very excited air.
You'll pay.
Call me.
No, Collin may be returned.
Visit next to the statue in an hour.
Inspectors and Jessup...
Quirke You can enter?
We look forward to hearing from you.
Nice apartment.
I love these old houses.
Do you live alone?
Yes.
Why?
Nothing...
Inspector Jessup will take notes.
If it does not bother you.
What has happened?
What did you, what did you see?
I was returning from a party given by my box...
The company Wentworth.
Collin Wentworth?
You work for him?
We celebrated a new contract.
I went to bed early.
About ten o'clock.
At 2:15
- I looked at the clock
- I woke up.
I heard a scream... as stifled... coming from the square.
I ran to the window.
Which window?
- The window of my room.
Can see?
The curtains were open?
And what did you see?
Here, just down...
He held her from behind and dragged into the street.
She fought.
He knocked down and began to strangle her.
At this point, she yelled 'to the rescue'.
Then he fled.
You did not call the police?
I thought it was not serious.
But the newspaper spoke another victim.
Do you think that there is a report?
Two not here, half an hour later .
I'm wrong?
No, it is our opinion.
You have done well to call.
Cigarette?
Do not smoke.
- Lucky...
It does not bother you?
You saw the aggressor?
Describe it, please.
Young... twenty years, 1 m80.
Distinguishing features?
Redhead...
Slicked back, ears clear.
- How was he dressed?
Beige jacket, blue jeans, tennis shoes.
Tennis or jogging shoes?
Tennis.
Vest or jacket?
Jacket.
You have the eye.
It had to come from behind this tree.
The girl said that the driveway was empty.
By the way, you know?
- Who?
The girl.
She lives next door.
She took the pot.
- From pot?
The other girl was raped and beaten to death.
He led many to the street...
To his car.
She really took the pot.
You're lying when you return?
Exactly.
You were alone?
Do not I already answered?
Not exactly.
I was alone.
This is why he was lying.
I wanted to be sure.
He was wearing a jacket or a jacket?
A jacket.
Why?
You went shopping?
I was upset.
I do not know what to do.
What has happened?
We'll talk on the way.
I have something to do.
You see this house?
The girl who was killed lived there.
I'll show you.
It also was attacked on her way home.
It happened shortly after.
How it all combined?
He knew where she lived?
Imagine:
Ýt goes down the street drive...
He is furious...
He feels frustrated after failed assault.
It stops at this stop.
His eyes fell on a car parked outside the house.
He sees a girl in the arms of her lover .
She kisses.
Without thinking, the killer is reverse.
It identifies the service entrance.
He parks his car...
And is walking.
His intuition whispers the girl lives here and it will soon return.
He ran to the front door and tampering lock to prevent the key to open it.
Then he goes down and slides to the service entrance...
There he watches and waits.
The girl out of the car, shaken the hand up the stairs.
She tries to open the door...
In vain.
She wants to prevent her lover, but he's already far.
So she decided to make the entrance.
She never came home.
This is the police who told you that?
The story of this girl?
The main...
The rest was in the newspaper.
I really appreciate thou hast helped me to do my duty.
By preventing the police.
Hopefully it will serve them.
When I see you again?
- Soon.
Very soon.
You have been shopping?
White wine.
You made mistakes, mate?
What do you mean?
A cop came to see you.
Inspector Jessup.
He wants you to call him.
What is it?
The other night, I witnessed of assaulting a girl.
Exciting.
No rape, assault.
Nothing to get excited.
What a night?
What night was it?
- The Thursday night.
The night of our holiday.
Exactly.
You do not call?
, I'll call.
This is Terry Lambert.
Inspector Jessup...
Okay... 7:00 is perfect.
I'm going to repeat myself.
You know the police.
No, not at all.
Your dedication amazes me.
I do not know what you citizenship.
Not bad.
I did not know your taste for French wine.
I'm starting to enjoy it.
Terry Lambert...
I just see the inspector Jessup.
They delayed.
Sit.
This will be ready in a moment.
What is ready?
What are you talking about?
You have just identified a suspect, right?
Identify a suspect?
I thought...
This is surely you.
They spoke of a witness.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
You surely have something to tell you...
But I ask you to remain silent.
Here...
Good look at these six men.
Worry, they do not see you.
I'm sorry, but I told you...
I know.
But sometimes seen more than we think.
Mr. Lambert saw the man accurately.
Really?
Go ahead, do not be shy.
This is...
To the end.
Take your time.
Look at each of them.
Carefully...
Turn left.
You've saw yet?
You we had described precisely.
To see them all together, I feel less safe.
If you were alone with him, you recognize him, right?
I believe.
Sure...
Your intuition was wrong.
One of the suspects has committed rape.
It fit with your description.
I must have been mistaken.
Should keep looking.
I'm sorry you do not have recognized.
Me too.
I've ever seen...
In 'Edgar.'
I'm a waitress.
I'm not a bouncer.
I'd get up when it happened to me.
I do not anymore.
There are many other things I can no longer do...
They think it is the same type that killed the other girl.
She died and I'm alive.
I should rejoice.
You think they will stop?
I hope so.
It does not even speak to him.
This is it.
Wait till he takes off his helmet.
If he is, what shall we do?
- I do not know.
Tell me already so it's him.
There are hundreds of redheads Baltimore.
Do you really think...
Look at best.
This is it, right?
Sylvia.
As you described:
Hair, size...
Even white skin.
I can not say.
I'm not sure.
I can not.
It could be him.
- It is possible.
Next?
What it would advance us?
I can not do anything now.
But if he is guilty and we know...
We do not know anything.
I'm not sure.
One of the men whom the police confronted me committed rape.
But nothing tells you it's the same.
I'm sorry.
I know you're disappointed, but I can not help it.
You know what...
When we'll see if it was anything other than roll.
I get you something?
Yes, a beer.
Pressure?
Joe, another tour.
I'm out.
I'll use it another?
I'm sorry.
I offer you a drink.
I owe you that much.
Do not wake up.
No luck.
I told you back before midnight.
Go to bed right away.
What will not resume I'll.
Descends # And keep quiet.
What is happening?
A girl was killed.
We found his body in the trash.
You know who this is?
What do you say?
- Interesting.
Here Peters...
It was at this time that goes to work?
Enough.
You new?
M. Lambert, here Peters OTP.
Pleasure.
Sit.
What a story.
I would like to ask you some questions.
Why did you not recognize Henderson earlier?
Henderson?
This is the name Chris Henderson.
I was afraid of being wrong.
So you followed.
At night to see under the same conditions.
What scrupulous man.
And there you have purchased sure that it was him.
But you have not said anything...
Why?
- I do not know.
Will you get a search warrant?
With this testimony and saw the past Henderson is possible.
Should be a link between Henderson and the victim.
She spent the evening in a bar with friends .
Let's see if someone out there recognizes Henderson.
Keep me posted.
I will certainly have the mandate, but...
Your assistance was invaluable.
If only I could help you earlier.
Do not fret.
Even if you had recognized earlier, we would not have stopped.
He was free that night.
Aggression you saw...
Will help us to support murder charge.
Should find a link between Henderson and victims.
If we do, it is earned.
Stop torturing yourself about that night.
You did for the better.
No doubt.
But I regret that you did it.
Tell me I'm wrong, it will do us no harm.
I simply using get a search warrant.
The attack itself does not interest.
You said you've followed the bar?
Not... that I have or not recognized night.
I no longer any reason to follow.
If they find out you're lying?
I do not care.
- But if they find out.
Whatever happens, I promise not tell them about you.
How do you inspector Quirke?
I understand...
Please keep me informed.
Good luck.
What did he want?
They had their warrant.
This is what you wanted?
- Yes...
But no one in the bar remembered Henderson.
They still had the mandate?
My testimony was enough for them.
Either way, it's over.
Or not they find a link between him and the victims in all cases, for me it's over.
The search was disappointing.
Neither fingerprints nor traces of blood or clothing nothing that proves the link with the victims.
Some lint that may come from the pull of a girls...
Were found toothpicks in the glove compartment of the truck.
Toothpicks?
If the two victims could not open their doors is a toothpick had been slipped into the lock.
The newspaper did not speak these toothpicks.
We had not revealed everything.
What will happen?
Peters will explain.
This judge is a pain in the ass...
You put on perfume?
- I was going to.
This is the situation:
We lack evidence.
Some plush toothpicks found everywhere...
My assistant has discovered several restaurants.
Baltimore to provide.
I do not understand.
Would not he the killer?
I do not know.
There have violated these girls and the knock fists.
He could throw the gloves he wore and his clothes stained with blood.
He was able to wash the floor of his truck.
But we can not prove he is guilty.
We will therefore confine ourselves to aggression that you saw.
Henderson We continue to attack.
For assault?
We are sure to win trial.
We have a witness.
You.
But you were mocking the attack.
Yes, as long as we hoped convict him of murder.
When he is in prison, we have perhaps more likely.
It could be killed?
I doubt we have the chance.
But Henderson could confide in someone that would work for us.
In this case, the Wedge.
Meanwhile, it would be out of harm's way.
You will be our star witness.
I did not expect that.
Do not worry, is in your pocket.
You just have to...
Tell the truth.
But you were sure that it would not happen.
He'll have to testify under oath.
You think it's fun?
What idea have called the police.
Should prevent this type of killing.
He can do whatever he wants.
It is the judge for assault.
What mess.
Whatever happens, I'll let you out of it.
You wanted to make mariolle...
With me, then with them.
You really think so?
You wanted to be a hero.
This is where it got us.
I have everything to lose in history.
I recognized you.
Since when...
What do you do?
Guess.
I accompany you, okay?
I am delighted to be judged.
You finished being sure it was him?
This is about right.
How are you?
- Better.
I entrust myself to run but the night as before.
I am preparing to testify at trial .
I'm nervous, do not you?
A little, I think...
My testimony little weight but I want to catch.
I am ready to do anything to convict .
I want her skin.
Do you feel the same.
If you knew how good it makes me to see someone who is not afraid to get wet.
I do not do much.
You tell the truth.
Many people do not do.
See you at trial.
I am ashamed...
Do you hate me?
Of course I'm with you.
I am afraid, that's all.
Me too.
Do you forgive me?
Say.
Come home.
I will attend the trial.
When you will show, you will do for us.
The words you say will mine.
I'll be by your side.
State your identity.
Put your left hand on the Bible...
Do you swear before the Court and jurors, to tell the truth, whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
Come to the bar.
It will not be long.
What were you doing the night April 21 at 2:15 in the morning?
I was at my bedroom window.
This window gives the Vernon Square?
What did you see?
A man struggling with a woman near the fountain.
Struggling physically?
Describe this fight, as accurately as possible.
He held her from behind and tried to drag ...
Objection.
Conclusions...
- Objection accepted.
He dragged?
Yes, to the street.
What has happened then?
She defended then he threw her to the ground.
Taking her by the neck, he tried to strangle her.
What did you do?
I wanted to open the window...
She screamed and he fled.
Watch this meeting.
Do you see the man who attacked the girl?
Designate the finger.
This is the accused that the witness has identified finger.
You are sure that the accused is the man you saw?
I'm sure.
Thank you, Mr. Lambert.
One moment, Mr. Lambert, there are two lawyers in this trial.
I want you to clarify certain points.
You were at home, instead Mount Vernon the night of April 21?
You saw your window a man fighting with a woman?
What time was it?
- 2h.
2am.
What did you do before?
Before?
You watching television?
You read?
You bavardiez?
- I slept.
In your bed?
Can not sleep watching TV?
No, I was in my bed.
Since when?
Approximately 11 h...
You come back from a party, is not it?
Have you been drinking?
No, I'm home early.
I worked hard and I was tired.
You had so wanted a good night's sleep?
At 2h you sleep deeply.
What woke you up?
I heard a scream.
A single cry?
No, there were two cries...
As muffled.
What did you do?
- I went to the window.
You are so up...
Have you turned on the light?
Have you been to the bathroom in the meantime?
No, I rushed to the window.
There, you see this man and this woman fight.
What did you do?
I wanted open the window, but she was stuck...
The woman screamed and the man fled.
He fled immediately?
She screamed twice 'Help.' and he fled.
I think...
It happened very quickly.
How long?
Two people fight, your window resists woman screams, the man fled...
It took how long?
Now, Mr. Lambert...
Five seconds?
Probably a little more.
- Probably a little more?
It happened a lot.
Would you say that you saw this man a short time and it moved quickly?
Is that correct?
- Yes.
How far is your window to the fountain?
I do not know...
Fifteen meters?
If I told you it is 22 meters?
22 meters?
I have never measured.
We measured.
The night of April 21 was clear?
It rained but it was clear.
The visibility was so good?
There streetlights.
I'm getting...
There is three lampposts along the street?
Yes, the square is well lit.
- Well lit?
This is what you say?
Both informed that this room?
Are you sure?
- Quite sure.
Quite sure.
Your Honor, I would like to try an experiment.
Objection, Your Honor.
What kind of experience?
This experience is useful?
I think...
It will not last more than two minutes.
We give four minutes on defense.
Last thing before you start.
Please remove your contact lenses.
What?
You wear many contact lenses, right?
Please remove them.
Mr. Lambert wearing hard contact lenses .
Is that correct?
These lenses irritate the eyes if kept sleeping.
He will surely be withdrawn for a good night's sleep.
That's right, right?
He?
said he was awakened by cries and have rushed to the window.
He?
can not say now it took time, in the dark, to the lenses.
Do not you?
No, I was not wearing.
I ask him to withdraw for this experiment.
I think you should you run and remove.
Hold.
- Thank you, I... a case.
M. Lambert, the distance that separates us is 20 meters.
Two less than your window to the fountain.
Usher, please turn off the light.
Your Honor, objection.
If there must be reconstitution conditions where the witness saw the accused it can not be in the presence of experts.
'S Give her two minutes to defense counsel.
Frankly, I'm curious to see where this is going.
I have a subject in hand.
Kindly tell us what the object.
It's...
It's...
You hold...
What is it?
I do not distinguish well.
Well, what is it?
A red book.
I put you on the road?
Is it a hat?
Is it a slipper?
Is this a red wig, by chance?
Let with light.
Now?
I see better.
I can see something.
But you can not identify, even in bright light.
This is a book.
A red book.
I understand that on your license it is clear that you need wear glasses.
You are nearsighted, right?
You're even extremely short-sighted.
I do not go that far.
Do not mock the court.
A person who can not distinguish an object.
Full light at a distance of 20 meters may be regarded as extremely myopic?
And do not you find it unlikely an extremely nearsighted person can identify a man preview night, at 22 meters, seconds?
You did not say you were nearsighted.
We do not ask me.
- How did he know?
He had to go serving license.
Chris Henderson was acquitted today insufficient evidence Police indicates nothing.
Again case 'killer garbage'.
I want to talk.
I am your neighbor.
We live together so to speak.
I'm Cathy Hofner.
- Terry Lambert.
I know.
Excuse my outfit.
I look like a slut.
I heard your not and I threw it on the back.
I'm going home.
I did not want to tell you but I dislike talk in the back of people.
Talking to whom?
At the police.
The police?
You mean the other day?
Yes, they wanted to know if I had seen aggression.
They returned today.
Today?
They asked me if I saw you that night.
If you have seen me?
I first said no then I remembered.
I heard footsteps and looked up the stairs.
I was nervous.
What did you see?
I saw you go.
The calm had returned long.
I was out taking the air.
You should have seen me out?
They asked me the same question.
No, I just saw return after 3 hours.
I'm sure it was not so late.
It does not matter.
Thank you for telling me.
At your service.
They released.
This is sickening.
Want a beer?
Willingly.
So the famous window?
Do you mind?
I know, Terry.
- What?
I know.
It's not that you were to the window.
What do you mean?
- She was the witness.
Not you.
- Who?
I am also sorry that you they have released...
You testified on his behalf.
Do not insist.
I saw in the square, and trial you blew it.
Pathetic.
Is she married?
Surely someone important.
But meanwhile, he is free.
We can not do anything.
It will not be retried.
Not for assaulting me, but more information they could stop...
For what he did other girls.
What are you doing?
The question is:
You, what will you do?
And she, what will she do?
My turn to watch.
Thanks for the beer.
The cops just left.
I have to remember?
They would not talk to you, but about you.
From Me?
Since when you are here, how you...
They asked on the night of the party.
Why you left early...
It is as if they suspected you.
Did they ask something else?
If I found you weird 26 and 27 April.
They believe that you note my moods?
Why precisely these dates?
Who knows?
I'm sorry that you have bothered.
Police still do not know anything about you.
They ask neighbors.
My phone is tapped.
They watch me.
This is not all.
Denise saw you with me and trial.
She knows.
I do not understand.
Your phone is tapped?
You must be mistaken.
The police would not do that.
Collin They interviewed this morning.
Collin?
- That's right.
Collin Why?
About Me.
You do not want to understand.
They think that you were not alone?
They can be if I did not kill these girls ask.
It stands:
I put my crime on the back of another.
This is ridiculous.
You are paranoid.
What did they talk to Collin?
April 26.
This is the date of the second murder.
And the night of the party...
Where I left early.
Collin especially should not think this party.
That would solve the problem yet.
What do you mean?
If he finds the pot with roses, you can go to the police.
The police?
There is no question.
You know.
Besides, surely you're exaggerating.
And the redhead, Henderson?
- So what?
It's free.
Because you did not testify.
I never said it was him.
You got ideas.
If it is, he may recur.
Stop, Terry.
You are unfair.
I'm not here for nothing.
It will work out.
The cops are not crazy.
And Denise Connelly?
- Who?
The girl he attacked.
She knows everything about us.
Tell him to give us a little time .
I have to think.
It is reasonable, right?
Maybe.
We will have.
It's not my fault if here we are.
I must go.
I did you wore lenses.
It was the reverse play.
Thank you, Denise.
I need to talk.
I return.
Sissi, you can replace me?
I told him you and the police.
The police are sure I'm no stranger to these crimes.
They do not know why you are lying.
You saw nothing, huh?
She saw and you talked to her place.
I think I'd make.
- It let you do?
You're either a dreamer or a calibrated.
I do not know which is worse.
Now, what does it say?
She wants to wait...
Unravels the police everything.
Fun.
You do not understand the situation.
She has a husband and a lover.
She wants it continues like this.
What are you doing?
If it again, I would not repeat.
But I am responsible, is not Sylvia to pay unless she changes her mind.
It is not there.
I told you so...
A dreamer.
And Henderson?
What will she do?
It is not sure that's him.
You were sure yet.
This is a long story.
I tell you one day.
Meanwhile, leave me a little time.
Denise, it becomes serious.
Okay, but I do it for you, not for her.
You soar and she knows what she's doing.
Come with me.
We would like to talk to you.
I am you?
This is useless.
I bring you.
Lambert.
You had not told us everything.
I'm sorry for the lenses.
- It's our fault.
We should have asked.
I'm not talking about that.
You went out that night.
You used to claim to bed and will be back to bed after the attack.
Yes, I'm out.
I forgot.
Yes...
Yes, it's true.
When?
Later...
Before bed again.
I wanted to look and take a look.
I was pumped.
When did you return?
Shortly afterwards.
This is why I forgot.
You asked my neighbors and my boss and you followed me.
You do not even when I'm...
I do not suspect?
Tell us about this bar.
What bar?
The 'Fells Point Saloon'.
This is where the victim spent his last hours.
Nobody remembers of having seen the redhead...
Chris Henderson.
But the waitress saw you.
She spilled a drink on you.
Forgot it.
Whence this photo?
You stop me?
Not now.
This time we move cautiously.
I think I'd better consult a lawyer.
It would be wise.
This is Terry, Sylvia.
You're crazy to call here.
I gotta talk to you
- It is impossible..
I need to see you immediately.
I can not see you.
Never.
You're not aware of.
The police questioned me and...
I can not see you or talk to you.
Do not make me...
- I have to go.
Do not hang up.
- Goodbye.
Who was it?
Terry Lambert.
I just see Mrs. Wentworth.
I'm Terry Lambert.
She was waiting for you?
I'm sorry, it is not there.
I'll see.
- Impossible.
There is no one.
Where are they?
Damn, where did they go?
They went to the ballet.
I do not know.
I'll talk to him.
What are you doing here?
- You did not give me a choice.
Are you crazy?
We'll see us.
- It does not matter anymore.
For you... not for me.
Everything will:
Our liaison that you are the witness...
Everything.
There is no question of the police know.
I told you from the beginning.
Do not touch me.
Do not you understand?
Is suspected me of murder.
Maybe they followed me.
Perhaps They watch me.
If you do not listen to me, I'll talk to Collin.
Sorry, it's too late.
What do you mean?
I confessed.
I had a hunch.
I told him that I had slept with you.
Once.
He forgave me.
But I swore that I was with him the night of the party.
He will not be drawn into this mess .
I agreed.
Everything okay?
- Thank you, that's okay.
I had to.
I do not have a choice.
I said you insisted to continue our relationship able to say that I was with you.
So you'll have to find another solution to your problem.
There are no other.
With or without you, I'm going to the police.
Do what you have to do.
I'll do what I have to do.
Tell me one thing...
It was he not?
Let me, please.
You were sure from the beginning, it was Henderson.
Okay...
I was sure.
Of course, I knew it.
I have a good view me.
It's almost intermission.
Wait a minute.
What's going on?
Bastard.
Stop it.
He?
stabbed my wife.
Stop it.
He killed my wife.
Call the police.
He's the killer.
You have nothing to do here.
He heads toward the exit.
Baltimore is in shock, after the murder of Sylvia Wentworth.
For the police the murder would not actually .
Killer 'garbage'
- Stronger.
We know that Terence Lambert, an employee of the victim's husband, witnessed a previous attack police search for questioning.
Thank you, Craig, for this story on the fly.
This morning hundreds of school boarded the ship...
You forgot your jacket.
- That's not true.
Here it is.
- Good evening.
Thank you, Peter.
- Goodbye.
Do you expect from me?
- Come with me to the police.
I'll tell them everything and ask them to believe me.
You saw Sylvia with me...
And trial.
Anyone can attend a trial.
She is the true witness.
Although I believe I can not prove it.
The theater people say that you killed her.
I am that have led to it.
I felt followed me but I did not think Henderson.
His plan was foolproof.
He killed which could confuse and exonerate me.
We believe that I wanted him to endorse my crime.
Come to me.
Want a beer?
Tell me...
Why did not you tell me suspected as the police?
I knew something that the police did not.
Remember the confrontation?
How to forget?
Something was wrong.
It was obvious that you had never seen me nowhere.
And you were mocking completely what happened.
Not flattering, but the reassuring thought.
It does not interest me kiss you, no more than kill me...
Nothing interest you.
It resumes, you know.
He will kill a girl or he will try.
The prison will be for me the perfect alibi.
What drives him to kill?
- Who knows?
Two of us, we know more than anyone else.
You were there when he spotted that girl in the bar.
I had not seen, but it should be at the bar and watch me.
The other girl she like me?
Not really.
What did she do for that remark?
You could not not notice.
She danced.
On a disc?
His friends encouraged.
She was attractive.
You did not dance?
No.
On Thursday he crowd.
I do not have time to breathe.
Has it produces something unusual?
This was the anniversary of Peter.
The bartender.
I remember for tomorrow he claimed his gift:
He asked me to come to him.
What happened special?
At midnight...
We bought him a cake and midnight I have been looking with Sissi.
Peter made a wish and blew out the candles.
And I kissed him.
Yes, I kissed him.
People laughed and cried.
I kissed him again...
Then he kissed me...
He?
kissed me for good.
The people were as crazy...
You do not remember seeing Henderson?
No.
In another bar either nobody has noticed.
The bar where you saw.
Another beer?
Both victims were young, pretty and behaved in a way that drew attention.
A sensual behavior.
What turns a normal type makes him furious.
It may be excited, but he wants to kill.
What a funny guy.
What are you doing?
I'll take my chances with the police.
You know a lawyer?
A guy who was in school with me.
I'll call.
Better not go alone.
You can sleep here if you want...
On the couch.
Call tomorrow morning.
You like it?
Sylvia?
If I loved him?
It was what is called a adventure.
I barely knew.
I was a hobby for her.
There are worse as a hobby.
You do not sleep.
What time is it?
Four and a half hours.
If you come in my room?
It would be my pleasure.
I find you... attractive.
This is not true...
And if...
But there is another reason.
Since that night...
There are things I can not do.
Tonight I could...
If you feel like...
Come.
There is a bed side.
Why not here?
Why not.
Terry?
Come on.
What was he?
Wait a minute.
Everything seems more clear this morning.
I.
I thought...
We said last night, that time is on our side and that sooner or later, he'll kill again.
You will then bailed.
Can rush things a bit.
What do you mean?
Think...
What what will happen?
It will find a girl clicked.
It can take time.
And if a girl deliberately caused the trigger?
The kind of girl.
Forget.
Why?
I will not allow it.
This is dangerous.
Not if you help me.
I said, 'Forget it.' Thank you.
This is nothing to side of what you have done for her.
And what did you say?
I was a dreamer or a sweet freak.
Probably both.
Anyway, you can not stop me.
You'll be in jail.
Do not forget.
No offense to your ego, I my reasons for wanting to catch him.
He attacked me.
Are you serious...
- Help me.
It will not work.
If this is you, you sniff a trap.
He did not recognize me...
I'm not attractive enough?
Why does he not recognize you?
Because I am a woman, in case you have not noticed.
How am I?
Inspector Quirke...
Terry Lambert.
You misunderstood me.
I intend to make myself.
But only you and the Inspector Jessup.
I ask you to do something...
Tonight.
One more day, what's the difference?
I'll call you at this number after 10 hours.
I'll explain.
Arrange to be there.
What did he say?
What did you do to your eyebrows?
- Dyed.
False eyelashes.
What do you say?
He works late tonight.
So what?
And he goes straight home?
I call Quirke.
Rest back a little.
Look me in your rearview mirror.
Go.
Hurry up.
You do not leave themselves, what happens.
If you lose me, wait for me.
- We could...
Too bad.
That file.
We are not leaving.
What.
Agree?
Talk about a move.
There is a phone behind.
We repeat...
I go and I put the bait.
If he seems to want to bite...
I call Quirke and I give him appointment with you.
Henderson follows me home.
If he attacks me, Quirke will witness.
You've got your gun?
- In my pocket.
A beer and booze.
- Tord Gut or schnapps?
Inspector Quirke is?
I want to be sure...
What is it?
- Offered by Jase.
Blue shirt.
This is nice.
You play?
- It happens to me.
Let's go.
The loser pays the tour?
- We play for fun.
The tour, I offer.
Two beers and two nish.
Nice shot.
Must pull his punches smooth in this game.
Always pull his punches smooth.
The concentration is also important.
Not bad.
What are you doing?
He will see you.
I'll call Quirke.
How do you know he's going to follow me?
It does not follow you.
He knows where you live...
Your wallet...
He saw...
He did the same thing again.
That's how he was able to tamper with the lock.
It falls into the trap.
Looks like...
He will go before you and wait you home.
Shit.
I suddenly important to thread.
I can...
Listen, asshole, wait your turn or find another phone.
Excuse me, this is urgent.
You have for a long time?
It bites.
I can not wait.
I pay you what you want...
Twenty dollars.
Go for a ride, buddy.
Another crazy.
Get out.
The eight in the top coat.
I have to go.
I want revenge.
- Next time.
I owe you a drink.
- We played for fun, right?
You're not going home alone?
You paid me a drink...
You have not bought me.
Let go of me.
- And if I refuse?
These two.
Will join the eight in the top coat.
You may have trouble but...
You want the phone?
- Yes.
What do you do?
No.
Get off me, man.
Denise.
No.
Stop.
Come on, that's enough.
Standing.
Are you deaf or what?
Show me your papers.
I phoned when this crazy...
- Looking for Inspector Quirke.
Tread Your papers.
Come on, you two.
Standing against the cabin.
Stretch your legs.
I do not have time.
There is urgency.
Calm.
Hands in the air.
Do not touch me.
This is good.
Nicely.

L. 16.. 1.
L. 16.
Hello.
Can you hear me?
There someone?
Frequency police...
Free line...
Perfect.
Can you hear me?
Look...
I want to talk to the inspector Quirke.
You are on the frequency police.
Free line.
I know, bitch...
I stole a police car.
Pass me the inspector Quirke.
Leave the car you fly looking for a phone.
I called the other cars...
Negative.
I'm alone.
Pass:.
By Terry Lambert.
I realize at Denise Connelly.
7345 Monument Street.
Near the square.
Quirke knows the house.
Notify the inspector Quirke.
Help.
Help.
You.
It will.
And you?
It does not take that file.
They will accuse me.
In here.
Help him.
Do not shoot.
Sooner or later, they would have stuck.
It would have forced a little chance.
What you put in the ignition?
A toothpick?
A trombone.
Great.
What will happen?
For your friend:
Perjury and obstruction in the courts.
It will look in ten, twelve years.
Just kidding.
Find yourself a good lawyer.
You do not have air a hothead.
But you played with fire, tonight.
You had the pot.
Both.
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY LIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT
HELLO.
I WASN'T SURE YOU'D COME.
I ALMOST DIDN'T,
AND THEN I GOT LOST,
ALL TURNED AROUND.
NOTHING LOOKED THE SAME.
WOULD YOU LIKE SOMETHING TO DRINK?
MAYBE THAT WOULD BE GOOD.
SOME WHITE WINE?
UH.
I'M OUT OF WHITE WINE RIGHT NOW.
I'VE HAD ENOUGH TO DRINK ALREADY.
MAYBE TOO MUCH.
HOW DID YOU GET AWAY?
MY SISTER'S HAVING PROBLEMS
WITH HER HUSBAND.
I TOLD COLLIN SHE NEEDED TO SEE ME.
AT THIS HOUR?
IT'S A CRISIS.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
"THANKS FOR THE PARTY."
COLLIN WON'T MISS ME.
HE'S YOUR HUSBAND.
I JUST WORK FOR HIM.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
I DON'T EITHER.
I'VE NEVER...
I KNOW.
WHY DID YOU...
WHY ARE YOU...
BECAUSE YOU WANT ME TO.
AND HAVE WANTED ME FOR A LONG TIME.
I WAS SO OBVIOUS?
I COULDN'T IGNORE IT.
AND I GUESS I'M TO THE POINT
WHERE I NEED TO BE WANTED LIKE THAT.
COLLIN...
OH, DON'T TELL ME COLLIN KNEW, TOO?
IF COLLIN KNEW...
YOU KNOW HIM.
WHAT DO YOU THINK COLLIN WOULD DO IF HE KNEW?
I DON'T KNOW.
MMM.
MMM.
I CAN'T MOVE.
THANK GOD.
HA HA!
BUT I HAVE TO.
EXCUSE ME.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
WHEW.
Woman:
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
TERRY!
UHH!
AAH!
TERRY!
WHAT?
HELP ME!
HELP!
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT HAPPENED?
HE WAS TRYING TO KILL HER.
WHO WAS?
HEY, YOU.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
HE'S GONE NOW.
HE HAD HER FROM BEHIND.
HE WAS DRAGGING HER TOWARD THE STREET.
THERE YOU GO.
TAKE MY ARM.
LOOKS LIKE SHE'S ALL RIGHT.
COME ON, COME ON.
HEY, THEY CAN SEE YOU.
HE WAS TRYING TO KILL HER.
TO REALIZE IT WAS REALLY HAPPENING.
DID YOU SEE HIM?
YES.
HIS FACE WAS SO WHITE.
OH.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
I'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
I'LL WALK YOU TO YOUR CAR.
20, 24...
WITH UNBELIEVABLE WHITE SKIN
AND RED HAIR COMBED BACK LIKE A DUCK.
A DUCK TAIL.
YES.
THAT COULD'VE BEEN ME DOWN THERE.
YOU MAY HAVE SAVED MY LIFE.
THE PLEASURE WAS MINE.
IN FACT, LET ME GO FURTHER.
IF I CAN BE OF SERVICE AGAIN...
OH, DON'T.
I CAN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT THAT NOW.
I'M SCARED AND LATER THAN I SHOULD BE,
AND THAT COULD BE TROUBLE FOR US BOTH.
ANY REGRETS?
NOT ONE.
IN SPITE OF WHAT HAPPENED,
MAYBE BECAUSE OF IT,
IT'S THE MOST EXCITING NIGHT
I CAN REMEMBER.
YOU?
REGRETS?
ARE YOU KIDDING?
ALL RIGHT!
HA HA HA HA!
ROUGH NIGHT LAST NIGHT?
YOU'RE LATE.
THOUGHT MAYBE YOU SLEPT IN.
HE'S BEEN ASKING FOR YOU.
COLLIN?
GOOD LUCK.
I WANT THE CONCRETE ON THE SITE.
IF I GET THERE AND FIND MY BOYS
SITTING AROUND PULLING THEIR PUDS...
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU LAST NIGHT?
WELL, SEE TO IT THAT YOU DO.
EVERY LAST YARD OF IT.
PARTY.
WHERE DID YOU DISAPPEAR TO?
OH, NOWHERE.
I WENT HOME.
AND THE NEXT THING I KNEW YOU WERE GONE.
WHAT'S THAT?
IT'S A BEAUTY, ISN'T IT?
BELONGED TO BUGSY SEGAL.
40 YEARS OLD, NEVER BEEN REGISTERED.
WHERE DID YOU GET IT?
A FRIEND.
GOT IT FROM A FRIEND.
HOLD IT.
FEELS GOOD, DOESN'T IT?
THE WAY IT FITS IN YOUR HAND.
ALMOST MAKES YOU WISH YOU HAD A REASON TO FIRE IT.
EXCUSE ME.
YOUR PAPER.
AHEM.
THANK YOU.
Hi, TERRY.
Hi, LILLA.
WELL, THE MARKET'S LOOKING UP.
HOW ARE THINGS COMING ON THE WOOTON PROJECT?
HELLO?
IN FACT, I'D BETTER GET BACK TO IT RIGHT NOW.
MAY I?
BE MY GUEST.
WHAT'S SO INTERESTING?
LOOKS LIKE THE MIDEAST IS HEATING UP AGAIN.
WELL, YOU SEE, THAT'S WHY I NEVER READ THE NEWS.
RIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT...
THE GIRL IN THE NEWS?
A FEW BLOCKS AWAY,
LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR LATER.
I THINK THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
NOT THE SAME GIRL, THOUGH.
MM-MMM.
YOU SAID THE ONE YOU SAW HAD BROWN HAIR.
MMM.
GOD, IT'S SCARY.
DID THE PAPER SAY ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT WITNESSES?
SAID THERE WEREN'T ANY.
MMM.
TERRY, IF IT WAS THE SAME MAN
AND NO ONE ELSE SAW HIM,
I SHOULD GO FORWARD,
GIVE THE POLICE A DESCRIPTION.
MM-HMM.
YOU COULD ASK THEM
TO KEEP YOUR IDENTITY A SECRET.
WHAT IF THEY WOULDN'T?
IT WILL ALL COME OUT.
WHAT ABOUT A LETTER?
NO, THEY WOULDN'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO IT.
THEY WOULD THINK IT WAS FROM SOME CRANK.
OH, JESUS, TERRY, I WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING.
WHY SHOULD MY LIFE BE TURNED UPSIDE-DOWN
JUST BECAUSE I HAPPENED TO LOOK OUT OF A WINDOW?
IT'S NOT FAIR.
MM-MMM.
AM I TERRIBLE?
NO.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
POLICE DEPARTMENT, PLEASE.
AAH!
TERRY!
I'LL TELL THEM WHAT YOU SAW,
ONLY I'LL TELL THEM THAT I SAW IT.
WHY SHOULDN'T I HAVE BEEN THE ONE LOOKING OUT OF IT?
HELLO?
YES.
I WITNESSED AN ASSAULT LAST NIGHT...
Okay.
THEY'LL PROBABLY MAKE A HERO OUT OF ME.
BUT YOU'LL BE LYING.
HELLO?
AND I THOUGHT I'D BETTER CALL UP ABOUT IT.
RIGHT OUTSIDE MY APARTMENT NEAR THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT.
12 EAST MOUNT VERNON PLACE.
TERRY LAMBERT.
SURE.
THAT'S THE MOST ROMANTIC THING
I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.
YOU DID THAT FOR ME.
YOU REMEMBER WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE?
MM-HMM.
TELL ME WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE.
TALL, RED HAIR.
MM-HMM.
YES, COMBED BACK
BEHIND THE EARS LIKE THIS.
MM-HMM.
WHAT WAS HE WEARING?
UH, TAN JACKET AND BLUE JEANS,
TENNIS SHOES.
WHEN YOU SAY TENNIS SHOES,
YOU MEAN TENNIS SHOES OR RUNNING SHOES?
I MEAN TENNIS SHOES.
AND I'M GOING TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU
LIKE NOBODY EVER HAS BEFORE.
BUT I'M NOT SURE WE'LL HAVE TIME
BEFORE THEY GET HERE.
GET HERE?
TERRY!
MM-HMM.
SOME DETECTIVE.
HE SOUNDED VERY EXCITED, ACTUALLY.
OH, MY GOD.
HA HA HA.
TERRY, YOU'RE GONNA PAY FOR THIS.
NO, YOU'D BETTER NOT.
COLLIN MIGHT BE HOME.
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT
IN AN HOUR.
I'M DETECTIVE QUIRKE, AND THIS IS DETECTIVE JESSUP.
MAY WE COME IN?
YEAH, SURE.
I'M SORRY.
NICE APARTMENT.
I LIKE THESE OLD BUILDINGS.
MM-HMM.
YOU LIVE HERE ALONE?
YES.
WHY?
DETECTIVE JESSUP WILL TAKE NOTES,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.
WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT YOU WERE DOING, WHAT YOU SAW.
WELL, I'D BEEN TO A PARTY, KIND OF AN OFFICE PARTY...
OFFICE?
WENTWORTH CONSTRUCTION.
COLLIN WENTWORTH?
YOU WORK FOR HIM?
YEAH.
ANYWAY,
WE JUST CLOSED A BIG ACCOUNT,
AND WE WERE HAVING A PARTY TO CELEBRATE.
I CAME HOME EARLY AND WENT TO BED.
AROUND 10:00.
THEN LATER, AT 2:15...
I REMEMBER, 'CAUSE I LOOKED AT THE CLOCK...
I HEARD A SCREAM, NOT VERY LOUD,
BUT I COULD TELL IT CAME FROM THE PARK.
I JUMPED UP AND I WENT TO THE WINDOW.
WHICH WINDOW?
THE BEDROOM WINDOW.
MAY WE SEE IT?
MM-HMM.
WERE THE DRAPES OPEN?
YES.
AND WHAT DID YOU SEE?
RIGHT DOWN THERE.
HE HAD HER FROM BEHIND
AND WAS SORT OF DRAGGING HER TOWARD THE STREET.
UH, SHE WAS STRUGGLING.
AND THEN HE THREW HER DOWN
AND THAT'S WHEN SHE SCREAMED REAL LOUD, "HELP!
HELP ME!"
AND THEN HE RAN AWAY.
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL THE POLICE?
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS THAT IMPORTANT,
UNTIL I READ ABOUT THAT OTHER GIRL THAT WAS MURDERED.
WHAT MADE YOU THINK THERE WAS A CONNECTION?
A FEW BLOCKS AWAY, HALF HOUR LATER.
NO, MR. LAMBERT, WE THINK THERE'S A CONNECTION, TOO.
AND WE'RE VERY GLAD YOU CAME FORWARD.
CIGARETTE?
NO, DON'T SMOKE.
GOOD FOR YOU.
DO YOU MIND?
DID YOU GET A GOOD LOOK AT THE ASSAILANT?
YES.
DESCRIBE HIM, PLEASE.
YOUNG, EARLY 20s, 6-FOOT.
ANY DISTINGUISHING MARKS OR CHARACTERISTICS?
RED HAIR, RED HAIR,
COMBED BACK BEHIND THE EARS IN A DUCK TAIL.
TAN JACKET, BLUE JEANS, TENNIS SHOES.
TENNIS SHOES OR RUNNING SHOES?
TENNIS SHOES.
WHEN YOU SAY TAN JACKET,
DO YOU MEAN A SPORTS COAT OR A WINDBREAKER?
WINDBREAKER.
YOU HAVE A GOOD EYE FOR DETAIL, MR. LAMBERT.
HE PROBABLY CAME FROM BEHIND THAT TREE.
THE GIRL SAYS THE SIDEWALK WAS DESERTED,
THAT HE CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.
SHE BARELY SAW HIM AT ALL.
BY THE WAY, DO YOU KNOW HER?
THE GIRL.
SHE LIVES AROUND THE CORNER.
AHEM!
NO.
SHE'S A LUCKY ONE.
THE OTHER GIRL WAS RAPED, BEATEN TO DEATH, AND DUMPED.
YOU SAID HE WAS DRAGGING HER TOWARD THE STREET,
AND HE WAS TRYING TO GET HER TO HIS VEHICLE.
SHE'S A LUCKY ONE, ALL RIGHT.
MR. LAMBERT, YOU SAID YOU CAME BACK FROM THE PARTY,
WENT RIGHT TO BED?
THAT'S RIGHT.
WERE YOU ALONE?
YES.
DIDN'T I SAY THAT?
NOT EXACTLY.
I WAS ALONE.
THAT'S WHY HE WENT TO SLEEP, DAVE.
JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE.
AAH!
DID YOU MEAN WINDBREAKER OR SPORTS COAT?
WINDBREAKER.
WHY?
I WAS SO NERVOUS.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.
THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT TO SEE.
THAT'S WHERE SHE LIVED, THE GIRL THAT WAS KILLED.
COME ON, I'LL SHOW YOU.
THIS ONE WAS ATTACKED ON HER WAY HOME, TOO.
BUT IF IT HAPPENED SO SOON AFTER,
HOW DID HE PLAN IT?
HOW DID HE KNOW WHERE SHE LIVED?
I SUPPOSE HE CAME DRIVING DOWN THIS STREET.
YOU KNOW, HE'S...
HE'S ANGRY.
EXCUSE ME, PLEASE.
Okay.
HE'S FRUSTRATED AFTER HIS ABORTED ATTEMPT
OUTSIDE OF MY PLACE.
HE STOPS AT THAT STOP SIGN RIGHT THERE.
LOOKING OVER, HE SEES A CAR
PARKED IN THE RED IN FRONT OF THIS BUILDING.
HE SEES A GIRL LOCKED IN THE ARMS OF HER LOVER,
HAVING A LAST GOOD NIGHT KISS.
ON IMPULSE, THE KILLER BACKS UP.
HE SEES THE SIDE DOOR OF THE BUILDING,
HE PARKS, AND RETURNS ON FOOT.
HE'S GUESSED THAT THE GIRL LIVES IN THE BUILDING.
THAT SOON SHE'LL BE GOING INSIDE.
HE RUNS UP THE STEPS TO THE FRONT DOOR,
WHERE HE DOES SOMETHING TO THE LOCK
SOMETHING THAT'LL PREVENT THE KEY FROM OPENING IT.
AND HE SLIPS BACK DOWN THE STEPS TO THE SIDE DOOR
TO WATCH AND TO WAIT.
THE GIRL GETS OUT OF THE CAR,
WAVES GOOD-BYE,
GOES UP THE STEPS.
SHE TRIES TO OPEN THE DOOR, BUT SHE CAN'T.
SHE TURNS TO CALL AFTER HER LOVER,
BUT HE'S ALREADY SPEEDING AWAY.
SO SHE DECIDES TO GO AROUND TO THE SIDE DOOR.
THE POLICE TOLD YOU ALL THAT...
ABOUT THE GIRL?
MOST OF IT.
THE REST WAS IN THE PAPER.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU HELPING ME DO THE RIGHT THING,
GIVING THE POLICE THE DESCRIPTION.
LET'S HOPE IT'S OF SOME USE TO THEM.
WHEN WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN?
SOON.
VERY SOON.
THERE YOU GO.
HEY, WHAT'S IN THE BAG?
A LITTLE LUNCH TIME SHOPPING?
UH, JUST SOME WHITE WINE.
HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO SOMETHING
YOU SHOULDN'T, OLD BOY?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
COP WAS HERE TO SEE YOU.
DETECTIVE JESSUP.
HE WANTS YOU TO CALL HIM AT THAT NUMBER.
THANKS, COLLIN.
WELL, WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT?
NOTHING MUCH.
A FEW NIGHTS AGO,
I WITNESSED AN ASSAULT ON THIS GIRL.
SOUNDS INTERESTING.
NOT A RAPE, COLLIN, MORE OF A MUGGING.
NO BIG DEAL.
WHICH NIGHT?
WHICH NIGHT?
YEAH, WHICH NIGHT WAS IT?
THURSDAY NIGHT.
THAT WAS THE NIGHT OF THE PARTY.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
WELL?
AREN'T YOU GOING TO CALL 'EM?
YES,
I'M GOING TO CALL 'EM.
IT'S TERRY LAMBERT, DETECTIVE JESSUP.
CERTAINLY. 7:00?
THAT WILL BE FINE.
PROBABLY GO OVER MY STATEMENT AGAIN.
YOU KNOW THE POLICE.
FRANKLY, I'M SURPRISED TO SEE YOU GET SO INVOLVED.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD SUCH A STRONG SENSE OF CIVIC DUTY.
HEY!
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU APPRECIATED FRENCH WINE, EITHER.
I'M DEVELOPING A TASTE FOR IT.
JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT.
YEAH, Okay.
JUST A SEC.
YES?
I'M HERE TO SEE DETECTIVE JESSUP.
THEY'RE RUNNING LATE.
IF YOU HAVE A SEAT,
THEY'LL HAVE IT SET UP
IN A FEW MINUTES.
YEAH.
BURGLARY.
UH-HUH.
NO.
OF COURSE.
YES, THANKS.
ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON.
LATE SETTING WHAT UP?
YOU SAID THEY WERE RUNNING LATE SETTING SOMETHING UP.
YOU'RE HERE FOR THE LINE-UP, AREN'T YOU?
THE LINE-UP?
YES.
NO, I THINK I WAS SUPPOSED TO JUST COME DOWN...
YOU MUST BE THE ONE.
I MEAN, THEY TOLD ME THERE WAS A WITNESS.
YES.
SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.
OH, Hi.
OF COURSE, YOU TWO MUST HAVE
BUT I'LL HAVE TO ASK YOU TO REFRAIN FROM DOING SO
DURING THE PROCEEDINGS.
RIGHT THIS WAY.
NOW THERE ARE 6 MEN I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT.
DON'T WORRY.
THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE YOU.
I DON'T WANT TO DISAPPOINT YOU,
BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE SEE MORE THAN THEY REALIZE.
BUT MR. LAMBERT HERE,
HE GOT A GOOD LOOK AT THE MAN.
YOU DID?
WELL, I, UH...
Jessup:
STEP RIGHT UP, GENTLEMEN.
DON'T BE SHY.
THAT'S RIGHT.
ALL THE WAY TO THE END.
TAKE YOUR TIME.
LOOK AT EACH ONE...
VERY CAREFULLY.
FACE LEFT, GENTLEMEN, PLEASE.
BUT YOU DID GET A GOOD LOOK AT HIM THAT NIGHT.
GOOD ENOUGH TO GIVE US
THAT DETAILED DESCRIPTION.
BUT SEEING THEM ALL TOGETHER LIKE THIS,
I JUST CAN'T BE SURE.
BUT SURELY IF YOU WERE TO COME
FACE-TO-FACE WITH THE MAN
YOU DESCRIBED IN SUCH DETAIL,
YOU'D RECOGNIZE HIM, WOULDN'T YOU?
YES, I THINK SO.
THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES.
YOUR HUNCH WAS WRONG.
ONE OF THE MEN YOU SAW TONIGHT
HAS DONE THIS KIND OF THING BEFORE.
THAT, COMBINED WITH YOUR DESCRIPTION...
WELL, OBVIOUSLY I WAS WRONG.
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING.
SORRY.
I'M SORRY YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HIM.
YEAH, ME, TOO.
I'VE SEEN YOU BEFORE...
AT EDGAR'S.
I DON'T THINK...
I COCKTAIL THERE.
IT'S NOT MY NIGHT FOR RECOGNIZING PEOPLE.
I WAS WALKING HOME FROM WORK THE NIGHT IT HAPPENED.
I DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE.
THERE'S A LOT I DON'T DO.
CAN'T DO TILL I KNOW WHO HE IS.
THEY SEEM PRETTY SURE THAT THE SAME GUY
ATTACKED THAT OTHER GIRL.
ONLY SHE'S DEAD, AND I'M ALIVE.
I SHOULD FEEL LUCKY, I GUESS.
DO YOU THINK THEY'LL CATCH HIM?
I HOPE SO.
WELL, GOOD NIGHT.
HE'S NOT EVEN TELLING HER ABOUT IT.
YOU'LL SEE WHEN HE TAKES HIS HOOD OFF.
WHAT IF IT IS HIM?
WHAT DO WE DO?
FIRST, YOU'LL HAVE TO TELL ME WHETHER IT IS.
TERRY, THERE MUST BE HUNDREDS OF YOUNG MEN
IN BALTIMORE WITH RED HAIR.
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU THINK...
THERE!
LOOK.
Man:
YOU CAN'T WELD IT DOWN HERE.
I WANT YOU TO HAVE A BETTER LOOK.
THAT'S HIM, ISN'T IT?
COME ON, SYLVIA.
HE'S JUST WHAT YOU SAID,
THE HAIR, THE SIZE, EVERYTHING.
EVEN THE WHITE SKIN.
I CAN'T SAY.
NOT FOR SURE.
WHY NOT?
I JUST CAN'T.
BUT IT MIGHT BE HIM.
IT MIGHT BE.
BUT WHAT GOOD DOES THAT DO?
WHAT GOOD DOES ANY OF IT DO?
I COULDN'T GO FORWARD BEFORE.
IT WOULD BE WORSE NOW.
IF HE DID WHAT HE DID TO THOSE GIRLS
BUT WE DON'T KNOW IT, TERRY.
I AM NOT SURE.
THAT DETECTIVE QUIRKE...
HE SAID THAT ONE OF THE MEN IN THE LINE-UP
WAS THERE BECAUSE HE HAD RAPED BEFORE.
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW THIS IS THE ONE
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT.
I'M SORRY, TERRY.
I KNOW YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED,
BUT THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
LET'S NOT SPEND OUR TIME DRIVING AROUND, Okay?
Okay.
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING FROM THE BAR?
UH, YEAH.
A BEER.
DRAFT?
YEAH.
HEY.
OH.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
WHOA!
YEAH!
WHOO!
WHOO!
WHOO!
WHOO!
GOOD LORD, HAVE MERCY.
Men:
TABLE!
TABLE!
Men, chanting:
TABLE!
TABLE!
TABLE!
TABLE!
TABLE!
TABLE!
Man:
YEAH!
NO KEEP GOING!
GO AROUND!
AND ME, MAKING A FOOL OF MYSELF.
HERE, WATCH THIS.
READY FOR ANOTHER?
NO, THANKS.
OH!
OH, MY GOD!
OH!
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
NO, REALLY.
LET ME BUY YOU A DRINK.
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.
IT'LL MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.
Okay, Okay.
IT'LL MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.
♪ TAKE ME IN YOUR ARMS AND MAKE LOVE TO ME ♪
DON'T WANT TO WAKE THEM.
NO SUCH LUCK.
CHRIS, IS THAT YOU?
YOU COME UP HERE!
I'M TIRED OF YOU BEING OUT
TILL ALL HOURS OF THE NIGHT!
I TOLD YOU TO BE IN THIS HOUSE BEFORE MIDNIGHT!
IF THIS EVER HAPPENS AGAIN,
YOU'RE PACKING YOUR THINGS AND LEAVING!
I MEAN IT!
GO ON DOWN!
YOU BE QUIET ABOUT IT DOWN THERE!
THAT'S IT.
GET HER OUT OF HERE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
THEY FOUND HER BODY STUFFED IN THERE ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.
ANY IDEA WHO SHE IS?
NAH.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
INTERESTING.
HERE'S PETERS.
IS THIS WHAT TIME
DON'T START, HUH?
I HEAR YOU GOT SOMETHING.
PETERS.
STATE'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE TOLD QUITE A STORY.
I'D LIKE TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS.
WHY DIDN'T YOU IDENTIFY HENDERSON AT THE LINE-UP?
HENDERSON?
THAT'S HIM...
CHRIS HENDERSON.
I DIDN'T WANNA MAKE A MISTAKE.
AT NIGHT, TO SEE HIM UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES.
UNUSUALLY CONSCIENTIOUS.
AT NIGHT YOU BECAME POSITIVE
HE ATTACKED MISS CONNELLY?
YES.
YOU STILL DIDN'T IDENTIFY HIM.
YOU WAITED... 2 DAYS.
WHY?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
HAVE WE ENOUGH FOR A SEARCH WARRANT?
WITH LAMBERT'S POSITIVE I.D., HENDERSON'S RECORD.
CAN I TIE HENDERSON TO THE DEAD GIRLS?
SHE WAS IN A BAR LAST NIGHT.
I'LL SEE IF ANYONE THERE RECOGNIZES HIS PICTURE.
I CAN PROBABLY GET THE WARRANT WITHOUT IT,
THANKS, MR. LAMBERT.
YOU'VE BEEN A BIG HELP.
I ONLY WISH I HAD HELPED SOONER.
EVEN IF YOU'D IDENTIFIED HENDERSON EARLIER,
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ARRESTED HIM.
HE'D OF STILL BEEN OUT ON THE STREET LAST NIGHT.
OUR CONCERN ISN'T THE ASSAULT ITSELF...
EXCEPT AS IT HELPS TO BUILD A MURDER CASE.
AND THANKS TO YOU, IT'S HELPING.
MAYBE WE'LL TIE HENDERSON TO THE DEAD GIRLS.
IF WE DO, WE'RE OFF AND RUNNING.
DON'T TORTURE YOURSELF ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN.
WHAT YOU DID WAS RIGHT, THERE'S NO DOUBT.
I JUST WISH YOU HADN'T HAD TO DO IT.
HE COULD COME BACK AND HURT US.
MY STATEMENT'S ONLY A TOOL FOR THEIR SEARCH WARRANT.
BEYOND THAT, THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ME
YOU DIDN'T TELL THEM YOU FOLLOWED HIM TO THE BAR?
EITHER I RECOGNIZED HIM AT NIGHT OR I DIDN'T.
I HAD NO REASON TO FOLLOW HIM.
SUPPOSE THEY DISCOVER YOU LIED?
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ME.
I PROMISE I WON'T LET THEM FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.
HELLO?
OH, HOW ARE YOU, DETECTIVE QUIRKE?
I SEE.
THANKS FOR LETTING ME KNOW.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
WHAT?
WHAT DID HE WANT?
THEY GOT THE SEARCH WARRANT.
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU WANTED?
I GUESS SO, BUT...
NOBODY AT THE BAR REMEMBERED HENDERSON.
BUT THEY'VE GOT THE WARRANT ANYWAY?
YEAH.
MY STATEMENT WAS ENOUGH.
THAT'LL BE THE END OF IT.
TO CONNECT HIM TO THE MURDERS OR THEY WON'T.
THEY'RE DONE WITH ME.
THE SEARCH WAS SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTING.
NO FINGERPRINTS, NO BLOOD SAMPLES, NO CLOTHING.
NOTHING TO PROVE HENDERSON EVER CAME IN CONTACT
SOME COTTON FIBERS MATCH THE SWEATER OF ONE GIRL,
BUT IT'S COMMON FIBER.
WE FOUND SOME PEPPERMINT-FLAVORED TOOTHPICKS
IN THE TRUCK'S GLOVE COMPARTMENT.
EACH GIRL WAS PREVENTED FROM ENTERING HER RESIDENCE
BY A TOOTHPICK JAMMED INTO THE KEYHOLE
AND THEN BROKEN OFF
THE NEWSPAPERS MENTIONED JAMMED LOCKS.
WE HELD BACK ABOUT THE TOOTHPICKS.
SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW?
I'LL LET PETERS EXPLAIN.
JESUS, THAT HOLDEN'S A BREAKING JUDGE.
HAVE YOU FILLED HIM IN?
I WAS JUST STARTING TO.
WE GOT A MURDER CASE WE CAN'T WIN,
SOME INSIGNIFICANT COTTON FIBERS,
SOME TOOTHPICKS ANYONE COULD POSSESS.
MY ASSISTANT LEARNED THAT BRAND
IS GIVEN AWAY IN LOTS OF BALTIMORE RESTAURANTS.
SO HE DIDN'T DO IT?
HE COULD HAVE RAPED THE GIRLS,
HAMMERED THEM TO DEATH WITH HIS FIST.
HE COULD HAVE THROWN AWAY THE GLOVES HE WORE,
ANY ARTICLES OF CLOTHING WITH BLOOD ON THEM.
A CAR WASH WOULD HAVE CLEANED HIS TRUCK.
WHEW!
WHAT I'M SAYING IS
WE CAN'T PROVE THAT HE DID IT.
SO DETECTIVE QUIRKE AND I HAVE AGREED
TO GO WITH THE ASSAULT CASE.
WE PROSECUTE HENDERSON ON THE ASSAULT CASE.
WE CAN WIN THAT.
IT'S OPEN AND SHUT.
WE GOT A WITNESS WHO SAW HIM DO IT...
YOU.
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE ASSAULT.
I DON'T IF THERE'S A CHANCE FOR MURDER,
BUT WE'RE UP AGAINST IT.
WE AREN'T GIVING UP ON THE MURDER CASES.
WE MIGHT GET LUCKY WHEN HE'S IN PRISON.
YOU MEAN SOMEONE MAY KILL HIM?
I DOUBT THAT LUCKY.
I MEANT HENDERSON MIGHT SHOOT OFF HIS MOUTH
TO SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO MAKE A DEAL.
MEANWHILE, HE DOESN'T HURT ANYONE.
HOW ABOUT BEING A STAR WITNESS?
I...
THIS ISN'T WHAT I THOUGHT WOULD HAPPEN.
DON'T WORRY.
IT'LL BE A BREEZE.
ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS TELL THE TRUTH.
YOU SAID THAT WOULD NOT HAPPEN.
YOU'LL HAVE TO TESTIFY UNDER OATH.
HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL?
WHY DID I HAVE TO LOOK OUT THAT WINDOW?
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO CALL THE POLICE?
IF HE'S NOT PUT AWAY, HE COULD KILL AGAIN.
ALL HE'S BEING TRIED FOR IS ASSAULT.
WHAT A MESS.
IT'S NOT YOUR MESS.
IT'S MINE.
I'LL PROTECT YOU FROM IT.
SO FAR, ALL YOU'VE DONE IS GRANDSTAND.
FIRST FOR ME, AND NOW FOR THEM.
YOU BELIEVE THAT?
YOU WANTED TO BE THE HERO.
SEE WHERE IT'S GOTTEN US?
I AM THE ONE WITH EVERYTHING TO LOSE!
SYLVIA.
HEY.
I THOUGHT IT WAS YOU.
HOW LONG...
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?
I'LL WALK A WHILE IF YOU LIKE.
OH, I'M...
I'M GOING.
I WAS HAPPY TO HEAR THEY'RE GOING TO PROSECUTE
WHAT HAPPENED?
YOU THOUGHT ABOUT IT LATER AND WERE SURE?
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
I'M BETTER.
I'M DOING THINGS LIKE THIS NOW.
I USED TO RUN AT NIGHT.
MOSTLY I'M JUST WAITING TO TESTIFY.
IT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT.
I'M NERVOUS.
ARE YOU?
YOUR TESTIMONY IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN MINE.
EVEN IF I HAVE TO GET UP ON THE STAND, I WANT TO GET HIM.
YOU MUST FEEL THE SAME WAY.
YEAH.
I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO ME
TO SEE SOMEONE WHO'S NOT AFRAID TO COME FORWARD.
I'M NOT DOING SO MUCH.
YOU'RE TELLING THE TRUTH.
THAT'S MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE WOULD DO.
SEE YOU IN COURT.
OH, TERRY, I'M SO ASHAMED.
DO YOU HATE ME?
OF COURSE I WANT TO STAND BY YOU.
I'M JUST SCARED.
SO AM I.
YOU FORGIVE ME?
DO YOU?
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS.
I WANT TO.
I DIDN'T.
AND I WANT TO COME TO THE TRIAL.
WHEN YOU TESTIFY,
YOU'LL BE TESTIFYING FOR BOTH OF US.
YOU'LL BE SAYING THE WORDS,
BUT THEY'LL BE MY WORDS.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE WITH YOU.
THIS WAY.
STATE YOUR NAME FOR THE COURT, PLEASE.
YOU SWEAR THE EVIDENCE YOU'RE ABOUT TO GIVE
IS THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH,
AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH?
YES.
PLEASE TAKE THE STAND.
THIS WON'T TAKE LONG.
WHAT WERE YOU DOING ON APRIL 21st AT 2:15 A.M.?
LOOKING OUT MY BEDROOM WINDOW.
YOUR BEDROOM OVERLOOKS THE PARK?
YES.
A MAN FIGHTING WITH A WOMAN.
PHYSICALLY FIGHTING?
WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS EXACTLY AS YOU ARE ABLE
HE HAD HOLD OF HER FROM BEHIND, TRYING TO DRAG HER...
OBJECTION.
CONCLUSION.
SUSTAINED.
WAS HE DRAGGING HER?
YES, TOWARD THE STREET.
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?
HE THREW HER DOWN ON HER FACE,
GRABBED HOLD OF HER NECK,
AND STARTED TO STRANGLE HER.
WHAT DID YOU DO?
I WENT TO YELL OUT MY WINDOW.
SHE SCREAMED, AND HE RAN AWAY.
I'D LIKE YOU TO LOOK AROUND THIS COURTROOM.
DO YOU SEE THE MAN YOU SAW ATTACK THAT GIRL?
YES.
PLEASE POINT HIM OUT.
LET THE RECORD SHOW THE WITNESS IS POINTING AT THE DEFENDANT.
YOU ARE SURE THE DEFENDANT IS THE MAN YOU SAW?
YES, I AM.
THANK YOU, MR. LAMBERT.
ONE MOMENT, MR. LAMBERT.
THERE ARE TWO LAWYERS IN THIS CASE.
YES, I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE YOU THROUGH THIS ONE MORE TIME.
PERHAPS IN A LITTLE MORE DETAIL.
YOU WERE IN YOUR APARTMENT ON EAST MOUNT VERNON PLACE.
YOU LOOKED OUT YOUR WINDOW
AND YOU SAW A MAN FIGHTING WITH A WOMAN.
YES.
WHAT TIME WAS THAT?
WHAT WERE YOU DOING JUST PRIOR TO LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW?
JUST PRIOR?
WERE YOU WATCHING TELEVISION?
READING?
CHATTING WITH FRIENDS?
SLEEPING.
IN YOUR BED?
YES.
NOT IN A CHAIR?
NO, I WAS IN MY BED.
WHEN DID YOU GO TO BED?
AROUND 11:00.
YOU HAD BEEN TO A PARTY THAT NIGHT, CORRECT?
YES.
DID YOU HAVE MUCH TO DRINK?
NO.
I LEFT EARLY.
I HAD BEEN WORKING HARD AND WAS TIRED.
SO YOU WENT HOME TO GET SOME SLEEP.
YOU'RE SOUND ASLEEP AT 2:00 A.M.
WHAT WOKE YOU UP?
I HEARD A SCREAM.
THERE WERE TWO MUFFLED SCREAMS.
WHAT DID YOU DO?
I WENT TO THE WINDOW.
DID YOU TURN ON A LIGHT?
DID YOU STOP TO GET SOME MILK?
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU SAW THIS MAN AND WOMAN FIGHTING.
I WENT TO OPEN THE WINDOW, BUT IT STUCK.
THE WOMAN SCREAMED,
DID HE RUN AWAY AS SOON AS SHE SCREAMED?
SHE SCREAMED TWICE, "HELP!
HELP ME!"
AND THE MAN RAN AWAY, I THINK.
WELL, IT ALL HAPPENED PRETTY QUICKLY.
HOW QUICKLY?
WHAT?
YOU SAW THESE PEOPLE FIGHTING.
THE WOMAN SCREAMED, THE MAN RAN AWAY.
IT HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY.
HOW QUICKLY?
FIVE SECONDS?
UH...
IT MUST HAVE BEEN LONGER THAN THAT.
FOR ALL THAT TO HAPPEN.
YEAH.
WHY DON'T WE JUST SAY THAT YOU SAW THIS MAN
FOR A BRIEF TIME PERIOD,
DURING MOST OF WHICH HE WAS MOVING QUICKLY.
WOULD THAT BE AN ACCURATE STATEMENT?
HOW FAR IS IT FROM YOUR WINDOW
TO THE FOUNTAIN STEPS?
15 YARDS?
IT'S 22 YARDS.
IT'S 22 YARDS.
I NEVER MEASURED.
WELL, WE DID MEASURE IT.
THE NIGHT OF APRIL 21st, WAS THAT A CLEAR NIGHT?
IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR.
SO VISIBILITY WAS GOOD.
THERE ARE STREETLIGHTS ALSO.
THERE ARE THREE, SPACED ALONG THE BLOCK.
YES.
THE PARK'S WELL-LIT.
WELL-LIT?
OH, YES.
AS WELL-LIT AS THIS COURTROOM?
NO.
YOU'RE SURE?
OF COURSE.
OF COURSE YOU'RE SURE.
YOUR HONOR, WITH YOUR PERMISSION,
OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR.
WHAT KIND OF EXPERIMENT?
THIS EXPERIMENT IS RELEVANT?
YES.
IT'LL TAKE TWO MINUTES.
THE COURT CAN INDULGE DEFENSE COUNSEL
FOR TWO MINUTES.
THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.
ONE THING BEFORE WE BEGIN...
MR. LAMBERT, WOULD YOU REMOVE YOUR CONTACT LENSES?
YOUR CONTACT LENSES.
YOU'RE WEARING THEM, AREN'T YOU?
YES.
THEN KINDLY REMOVE THEM.
MR. LAMBERT WEARS HARD CONTACT LENSES.
THAT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT?
THEY'RE IRRITATING IF YOU SLEEP WITH THEM IN.
HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN THEM OUT THAT NIGHT.
ISN'T THAT TRUE?
HE JUST SAID THAT WHEN HE WAS AWAKENED BY SCREAMS,
HE HURRIED TO THE WINDOW WITHOUT MAKING ANY STOPS.
SURELY HE WON'T NOW SAY HE PUT IN CONTACT LENSES.
WILL YOU?
NO, I DIDN'T HAVE THEM IN.
SO I REPEAT MY REQUEST THAT YOU REMOVE THEM.
I THINK YOU'D BETTER REMOVE THEM.
HERE.
NO, I, UH...
I HAVE A LENS CASE.
NOW, MR. LAMBERT, THE DISTANCE BETWEEN US
FROM YOUR BEDROOM WINDOW TO THE FOUNTAIN STEPS.
TURN OUT THE LIGHTS.
OBJECTION.
IF WE ARE TO RE-CREATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES
UNDER WHICH THE WITNESS OBSERVED THE DEFENDANT,
SURELY IT SHOULD BE DONE PROPERLY, BY EXPERTS.
LET'S INDULGE DEFENSE COUNSELOR FOR TWO MINUTES.
FRANKLY, I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHERE THIS IS HEADING.
PROCEED.
THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.
MR. LAMBERT, I'M HOLDING IN MY HAND AN OBJECT.
COULD YOU KINDLY TELL THE COURT
WHAT THIS OBJECT IS?
IT'S A...
YOU'RE HOLDING, UM...
COME ON, MR. LAMBERT.
WHAT IS IT?
I CAN'T QUITE MAKE IT OUT.
COME ON, MR. LAMBERT.
WHAT IS IT?
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
HELP!
HELP ME!
SHALL I GIVE YOU A HINT, MR. LAMBERT?
IS IT A CAP?
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
IS IT A LADY'S SLIPPER?
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
IS IT A RED WIG?
WELL, LET'S TRY IT WITH THE LIGHTS ON.
HOW ABOUT NOW, MR. LAMBERT?
I CAN SEE...
I CAN SEE THAT SOMETHING'S THERE.
BUT YOU CAN'T IDENTIFY IT,
NOT EVEN WITH THE LIGHTS ON.
JUST A BOOK, MR. LAMBERT.
JUST A RED BOOK.
I SEE WHY MOTOR VEHICLES STIPULATES
THAT YOU CAN'T DRIVE WITHOUT GLASSES OR CONTACTS.
YOU'RE SHORTSIGHTED.
YES.
IN FACT, YOU'RE EXTREMELY SHORTSIGHTED.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT EXTREMELY.
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE THAT A PERSON WHO FAILED TO DISTINGUISH AN OBJECT
IN A BRIGHTLY LIT COURTROOM FROM 20 YARDS AWAY
COULD FAIRLY BE DESCRIBED AS EXTREMELY SHORTSIGHTED?
YES.
WOULDN'T YOU ALSO AGREE THAT IT WOULD BE UNLIKELY
THAT AN EXTREMELY SHORTSIGHTED PERSON
COULD POSITIVELY IDENTIFY SOMEONE GLIMPSED AT NIGHT
FROM 22 YARDS AWAY FOR ONLY A FEW SECONDS?
YOU NEVER SAID YOU'RE NEARSIGHTED!
YOU NEVER ASKED.
WITH MOTOR VEHICLE REGISTRATION!
ACCUSED ASSAILANT CHRIS HENDERSON
THE CASE AGAINST HIM DISMISSED
FOR INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE.
BALTIMORE POLICE REPORT NO NEW LEADS
IN THE SO-CALLED DUMPSTER MURDERS.
COULD I TALK TO YOU, PLEASE?
I'M YOUR NEIGHBOR.
IT'S FUNNY HOW TWO PEOPLE CAN LIVE SO CLOSE
AND...
MY NAME IS KATHY.
KATHY HOFFNER.
TERRY LAMBERT.
OH, PLEASE EXCUSE THE WAY I LOOK.
I'M SUCH A SLOB TODAY.
I HEARD YOUR FOOTSTEPS ON THE STAIRS,
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS PROBABLY YOU,
SO I JUST THREW THIS ON AND CAME OUT.
WELL, I'M JUST GETTING HOME.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER TO SAY ANYTHING,
I FEEL FUNNY ABOUT TALKING BEHIND PEOPLE'S BACKS.
TALK TO WHO?
THE POLICE.
THE POLICE.
OH, YOU MEAN BACK THEN.
I TALKED TO THEM BACK THEN, TOO.
THEY ASKED ME IF I WAS AWAKENED BY THE ATTACK.
THEY WERE HERE AGAIN TODAY.
TODAY?
THEY ASKED ME IF I SAW YOU THAT NIGHT.
SEEN ME?
FIRST I THOUGHT I HADN'T.
THEN I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD PEEKED OUT
WHEN I HEARD FOOTSTEPS COMING UP THE STAIRS.
I WAS NERVOUS AFTER WHAT HAD HAPPENED.
WHAT DID YOU SEE?
I SAW YOU COMING BACK IN.
THIS WAS LATER, AFTER THE EXCITEMENT HAD DIED DOWN.
I WENT OUT FOR SOME AIR.
DID YOU SEE ME GO OUT?
THE POLICE ASKED ME THE SAME QUESTION.
I JUST SAW YOU COMING IN.
MUST HAVE BEEN AFTER 3:00.
OH, I'M SURE IT WASN'T THAT LATE.
NO.
THANKS FOR LETTING ME KNOW ABOUT THE POLICE.
ANYTIME.
ANYTIME AT ALL.
YOU HEARD THEY LET HIM GO.
IT'S SICKENING, ISN'T IT?
WANT A BEER?
THANKS.
I WOULD.
SO THAT'S THE FAMOUS BEDROOM WINDOW?
YEAH.
DO YOU MIND?
I KNOW, TERRY.
WHAT?
IT WASN'T YOU IN THE BEDROOM WINDOW.
SHE WAS THE WITNESS.
SHE SAW IT, NOT YOU.
WHO?
I'M SORRY THEY LET HIM GO.
BUT YOU WENT FORWARD...
SAVE IT, TERRY!
I SAW HER IN THE PARK,
AND I SAW HER IN COURT COACHING YOU.
PATHETIC.
WHAT, IS SHE MARRIED?
MUST BE, TO SOMEONE POWERFUL.
IT DOESN'T MATTER, REALLY.
WHAT MATTERS IS HE'S OUT THERE, FREE.
THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT THAT.
THEY CAN'T TRY HIM AGAIN.
NOT FOR ATTACKING ME,
BUT WITH SOME MORE INFORMATION,
THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET HIM
FOR WHAT HE DID TO THE OTHERS,
THE GIRLS THAT DIDN'T HAVE SOMEONE LIKE YOU TO PROTECT THEM.
THE QUESTION ISN'T WHAT AM I GOING TO DO,
IT'S WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
AND WHAT IS SHE GOING TO DO?
NOW IT'S MY TURN TO WATCH.
THANKS FOR THE BEER.
TERRY!
THE COPS HAVE BEEN HERE.
THEY JUST LEFT.
HERE?
THEY WANT ME TO CALL THEM?
THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU...
THEY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT YOU.
ABOUT ME?
HOW LONG YOU'VE BEEN HERE, WHAT YOU'RE LIKE.
THEY ALSO WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE NIGHT OF THAT PARTY WE HAD.
WHAT YOUR MOOD WAS, WHY YOU LEFT EARLY.
IT'S ALMOST AS THOUGH THEY SUSPECT YOU OF SOMETHING.
DID THEY ASK ANYTHING ELSE?
IF I'D NOTICED ANYTHING UNUSUAL ABOUT YOU
ON APRIL 26 OR 27.
WHAT?
THEY THINK YOU KEEP A DIARY OF MY MOODS?
WHY WOULD THEY ASK ABOUT THOSE DATES IN PARTICULAR?
WHO KNOWS?
ANYWAY, THANKS, COLLIN.
I'M SORRY THEY BOTHERED YOU.
THE POLICE DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, NOT YET.
THEY'VE BEEN QUESTIONING MY NEIGHBORS.
I THINK THEY'VE TAPPED MY PHONE.
THEY'VE BEEN WATCHING ME.
SHE SAW YOU IN COURT.
SHE'S FIGURED IT OUT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
TERRY, YOU MADE A MISTAKE, A SIMPLE MISTAKE.
THE POLICE WOULDN'T DO THAT.
THEY WERE AT THE OFFICE THIS MORNING
QUESTIONING COLLIN.
COLLIN?
THAT'S RIGHT.
WHY WOULD THEY QUESTION COLLIN?
ABOUT ME!
SYLVIA!
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU!
DO THEY SUSPECT YOU WERE...
WITH SOMEBODY?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY SUSPECT.
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE WONDERING
IF MAYBE I DIDN'T KILL THOSE GIRLS.
THEY'RE TRYING TO PUT THE BLAME ON SOMEBODY ELSE.
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
YOU'RE BEING PARANOID.
ANYWAY, WHAT DID THEY TALK TO COLLIN ABOUT?
THEY ASKED ABOUT APRIL 26,
THAT'S THE DATE OF THE SECOND MURDER.
THEY ALSO ASKED HIM ABOUT THE NIGHT OF THE PARTY...
WHY I LEFT EARLY.
THE PARTY?
WHAT IF COLLIN STARTS THINKING ABOUT THE PARTY?
WELL, ONE WAY, THAT WOULD PARTIALLY SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU WOULDN'T NEED TO BE SO AFRAID TO GO TO THE POLICE.
GO TO THE POLICE?
I CAN'T DO THAT.
YOU KNOW THAT.
YOU'VE ALWAYS KNOWN.
BESIDES, I THINK YOU'RE EXAGGERATING THE WHOLE THING.
WHAT ABOUT THE REDHEAD, HENDERSON?
IF YOU'D TESTIFIED, HE WOULDN'T HAVE.
I NEVER SAID IT WAS HIM.
I WAS NEVER SURE.
YOU MADE UP YOUR OWN MIND ABOUT THAT.
IF IT WAS HIM, HE COULD DO IT AGAIN.
STOP IT, TERRY.
THAT'S NOT FAIR.
IT'S NOT MY FAULT THIS IS HAPPENING.
BESIDES, IT'LL WORK OUT.
THE POLICE AREN'T FOOLS.
WHAT ABOUT DENISE CONNELLY?
WHO?
THE GIRL THAT WAS ATTACKED!
SHE KNOWS ALL ABOUT US.
TELL HER WE NEED A LITTLE TIME.
I HAVE TO THINK.
SHE'LL BE REASONABLE, WON'T SHE?
MAYBE.
SHE HAS TO BE.
I DIDN'T GET US INTO THIS.
YOU KNOW THAT.
I HAVE TO GO NOW.
I DO.
I NEVER EVEN KNEW YOU WORE CONTACT LENSES.
LITTLE REVERSE ENGLISH, YOU'D HAVE DONE ALL RIGHT, AL.
THANKS, DENISE.
♪ AND IF YOU EVER TOUCH MY WOMAN ♪
♪ WELL, BOY, YOU'RE GONNA WEAR THE SCARS ♪
♪ CHECK IT OUT... ♪
HELLO.
Hi.
I NEED TO TALK.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
♪ CHECK IT OUT ♪
♪ YOU'RE RUNNIN' OUT OF TIME... ♪
UH, C.C., COVER ME, WILL YOU?
♪ WITH A CRIMINAL MIND ♪
♪ AH YA YA YA... ♪
NOW, THE POLICE SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN IT INTO THEIR HEADS
THAT MAYBE I HAD SOMETHING TO DO
THEY KNOW YOU LIED.
THEY JUST DON'T KNOW WHY.
YEAH.
DID YOU SEE ANY OF IT THAT NIGHT?
SHE SAW IT, BUT SHE WOULDN'T GO FORWARD,
SO YOU TOOK HER PLACE.
I THOUGHT I COULD BRING IT OFF.
AND SHE LET YOU?
YOU'RE EITHER A ROMANTIC FOOL,
OR YOU'RE AN IDIOT.
I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS WORSE.
WHAT DOES SHE SAY NOW, NOW THAT YOU'RE IN A SPOT?
SHE WANTS TO WAIT...
GIVE TIME TO THE POLICE TO SORT IT OUT.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HER POSITION.
SURE, I DO.
SHE HAS A HUSBAND AND A STUD ON THE SIDE,
AND NOBODY THE WISER.
SHE WANTS TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.
UH, DENISE...
YEAH.
SO, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NOW?
IF I HAD IT TO DO OVER, I'D DO IT DIFFERENTLY.
BUT IT WAS MY IDEA TO HANDLE IT THE WAY WE DID,
AND I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR FOR ME
UNLESS SHE'S COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION I HAVE.
LIKE I SAID, A ROMANTIC FOOL.
WHAT ABOUT HENDERSON?
SHE'S NOT SURE IT WAS HENDERSON, AND SHE NEVER WAS.
BUT YOU WERE SURE.
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
AND I'D LIKE TO TELL IT TO YOU SOMEDAY.
I WOULD.
BUT RIGHT NOW, DENISE, ALL I WANT IS A LITTLE MORE TIME.
DENISE, SERIOUSLY.
COME ON.
BUT I'M GIVING THE TIME TO YOU, NOT TO HER.
YOU'RE THE ROMANTIC FOOL.
SHE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT SHE'S DOING.
♪ OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH ♪
♪ NA, NA, NA ♪
Child:
I'VE GOT IT!
HA HA HA!
MR. LAMBERT?
GOOD MORNING.
WOULD YOU MIND COMING WITH ME?
DETECTIVE QUIRKE AND I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU FOR A FEW MINUTES.
SHALL I FOLLOW YOU?
THAT'S Okay.
I'LL BRING YOU BACK.
MR. LAMBERT.
SEEMS YOU HAVEN'T BEEN EXACTLY TRUTHFUL WITH US.
OH, YES.
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE CONTACTS.
THAT'S OUR FAULT.
WE SHOULD HAVE ASKED.
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT.
WE'VE LEARNED THAT YOU WENT OUT THAT NIGHT.
YOU TOLD US YOU WERE IN BED.
YES.
THAT YOU WERE AWAKENED, YOU WITNESSED THE ATTACK,
AND THEN YOU WENT RIGHT BACK TO BED.
YES, I DID GO OUT.
I...
I FORGOT.
YOU FORGOT?
YES, I...
YEAH, I DID.
IT'S...
WHEN DID YOU GO OUT?
UH, AFTERWARD, BEFORE I WENT BACK TO SLEEP.
I WENT TO GET SOME AIR AND LOOK AROUND.
I WAS ALL KEYED UP.
IT'S...
WHEN DID YOU COME BACK?
A FEW MINUTES LATER.
THAT'S WHY I FORGOT.
LOOK, I KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN QUESTIONING
MY NEIGHBORS AND MY BOSS,
AND YOU'VE BEEN HAVING ME FOLLOWED,
BUT I...
LOOK, YOU DON'T REALLY THINK THAT I'M...
I'M NOT A SUSPECT, AM I?
SUPPOSE YOU TELL US ABOUT THE BAR.
WHAT BAR?
WHERE THE MURDERED GIRL STEPHANIE LUGIE
SPENT THE LAST HOURS OF HER LIFE,
WHERE NO ONE...
NO ONE...
CAN REMEMBER
HAVING SEEN THE REDHEAD CHRIS HENDERSON.
COCKTAIL WAITRESS REMEMBERS YOU QUITE CLEARLY.
SHE SPILLED A DRINK ON YOU.
WAS THAT SOMETHING ELSE YOU FORGOT?
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT PICTURE?
AM I...
ARE YOU ARRESTING ME?
NO.
NOT JUST YET.
WE'RE MOVING A LITTLE SLOWER THIS TIME AROUND.
I DON'T THINK I SHOULD ANSWER ANY MORE QUESTIONS
UNTIL I CONSULT AN ATTORNEY.
THAT MIGHT BE WELL-ADVISED.
HELLO.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU CAN'T JUST CALL HERE!
WE HAVE TO TALK.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!
I HAVE TO SEE YOU RIGHT AWAY.
NO!
I CAN'T SEE YOU.
I CAN'T SEE YOU AT ALL ANYMORE.
I'VE BEEN TO THE POLICE.
THEY'VE BEEN QUESTIONING ME.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
I CAN'T SEE YOU,
AND I CAN'T TALK TO YOU.
SYLVIA, DON'T MAKE ME...
I HAVE TO GO NOW.
DON'T HANG UP ON ME!
GOODBYE!
WHO WAS THAT, DEAR?
TERRY.
TERRY LAMBERT.
TELL MRS. WENTWORTH IT'S TERRY LAMBERT.
WAS SHE EXPECTING YOU?
I'M SORRY, BUT SHE ISN'T HERE.
YOU TELL HER, OR SHALL I?
SHE'S NOT HERE.
NO ONE'S HERE.
WHERE ARE THEY?
DAMN IT!
WHERE HAVE THEY GONE?
THE BALLET.
THEY'VE GONE TO THE BALLET.
I don't know.
Listen, I'm going to talk with him.
What are you doing here?
You gave me no choice.
Are you crazy?
People will see us!
We've gone past where any of that matters.
You may have.
I haven't.
Our affair, the fact that you witnessed the attack...
I'VE TOLD YOU...
I WILL NEVER, NEVER
SYLVIA!
I'VE TOLD YOU THAT FROM THE START!
SHH!
DON'T TOUCH ME!
THEY SUSPECT ME OF MURDER.
I'VE BEEN FOLLOWED.
THEY MAY HAVE FOLLOWED ME HERE.
THEY MAY BE WATCHING ME RIGHT NOW.
THEN YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE BUT TO TALK TO COLLIN MYSELF.
I'M SORRY, TERRY, BUT IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.
I'VE ALREADY TOLD HIM.
I HAD A FEELING...
TOLD HIM WHAT?
THAT I WENT TO BED WITH YOU...
ONCE.
ON CONDITION I SWEAR I WAS IN BED WITH HIM THE NIGHT OF THE PARTY.
HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE DRAGGED INTO THAT MESS!
I TOLD HIM I WOULD.
HEY!
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH, THANK YOU.
I'M FINE.
I HAD TO.
I HAD NO CHOICE.
AND I TOLD HIM YOU'D BEEN AFTER ME EVER SINCE
TO CONTINUE THE AFFAIR,
TO SAY I WAS WITH YOU WHEN I WASN'T.
YOU'LL HAVE TO FIND SOME OTHER WAY TO SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS.
THERE IS NO OTHER WAY.
WITH OR WITHOUT YOU, I'M GOING TO THE POLICE.
WELL,
YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO...
AND I'LL DO WHAT I HAVE TO DO.
GOODBYE.
IT WAS HIM, WASN'T IT?
THE REDHEAD?
LET GO OF ME, PLEASE.
YOU WERE SURE, WEREN'T YOU,
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING?
YOU WERE SURE IT WAS HENDERSON.
ALL RIGHT.
I WAS SURE!
OF COURSE I WAS SURE.
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH MY EYES.
THE ACT IS ALMOST OVER.
IT WOULD BE BETTER TO WAIT.
OF COURSE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
OH!
MMM MMM MMM!
AH!
AH...
AH...
SYLVIA!
YOU BASTARD!
GRAB HIM!
HE STABBED MY WIFE!
UNH!
GET HIM!
AAH!
OH!
OH, GOD!
AAH!
HE KILLED MY WIFE!
STOP HIM!
AAH!
CALL THE POLICE!
AAH!
AAH!
GET HIM!
GET HIM!
AAH!
AAH!
HE'S THE KILLER!
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE BACK HERE.
HEY!
SECURITY!
GET SECURITY!
YEAH...
THE BACK DOOR.
TONIGHT THE BALTIMORE SOCIAL COMMUNITY IS SHOCKED
OVER THE MURDER OF ONE OF ITS OWN.
BUT POLICE REFUSE TO SPECULATE
HERE AT THE TOWNSEND THEATER IS CONNECTED
TO THE SO-CALLED DUMPSTER MURDERS.
AN EMPLOYEE OF THE DEAD WOMAN'S HUSBAND,
COLLIN WENTWORTH, WAS A WITNESS
TO AN EARLIER RELATED ASSAULT.
POLICE ARE SEEKING HIM FOR QUESTIONING.
THANK YOU, CRAIG, FOR THAT LIVE MINICAM REPORT.
HUNDREDS OF SCHOOLCHILDREN SWARMED ABOARD THE TALL SHIP...
DENISE...
OH!
OH!
OW!
DENISE!
OH, MY GOD.
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
WELL, HERE IT IS.
GOOD NIGHT.
YEAH.
THANKS, PETER.
GOOD NIGHT.
SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
I'LL TELL THEM EVERYTHING AND TRY TO GET THEM TO BELIEVE ME.
YOU'D SEEN US TOGETHER.
YOU SAW SYLVIA AT THE TRIAL.
WHY SHOULDN'T SHE BE AT THE TRIAL?
BUT DENISE, YOU KNOW SHE WAS THE REAL WITNESS.
I CAN SAY I THINK THAT.
I CAN'T PROVE IT.
THOSE PEOPLE AT THE TOWNSEND THEATER
WILL SAY THEY THINK YOU KILLED HER.
I LED HIM STRAIGHT TO HER.
I KNEW I WAS BEING FOLLOWED, BUT NOT THAT IT WAS HENDERSON.
AND HE COULDN'T HAVE PLANNED IT BETTER.
HE GOT RID OF THE ONE PERSON THAT COULD IMPLICATE HIM
AND THE ONE PERSON THAT COULD CLEAR ME.
SO NOW IT LOOKS LIKE I WAS TRYING
TO SHIFT THE BLAME FROM THE BEGINNING.
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS.
WANT A BEER?
YEAH.
TELL ME SOMETHING.
YOU DIDN'T SUSPECT ME LIKE THE POLICE.
WHY?
I KNEW SOMETHING THE POLICE DIDN'T.
REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME WE MET?
THE LINE-UP?
HOW COULD I FORGET?
I KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG EVEN THEN.
IT WAS OBVIOUS YOU'D NEVER SEEN ME BEFORE,
FROM YOUR BEDROOM WINDOW OR ANYPLACE ELSE,
AND YOU WERE COMPLETELY INDIFFERENT TO WHAT YOU DID SEE.
NOT FLATTERING, PERHAPS, BUT UPON REFLECTION, TRUSTWORTHY.
YOU WEREN'T INTERESTED IN FUCKING ME,
AND YOU CERTAINLY WEREN'T INTERESTED IN KILLING ME.
YOU WEREN'T INTERESTED, PERIOD.
HE'LL DO IT AGAIN, YOU KNOW.
KILL SOME GIRL, OR TRY TO.
I'LL BE SAFE IN JAIL.
THE PERFECT ALIBI.
I WONDER WHAT SETS HIM OFF.
BETWEEN THE 2 OF US, WE KNOW MORE ABOUT IT THAN ANYBODY.
YOU WERE THERE THAT NIGHT AT THE BAR
WHEN HE PICKED OUT THAT SORORITY GIRL.
THE NIGHT HE ATTACKED ME, I DON'T REMEMBER HIM AT THE BAR,
BUT HE WAS PROBABLY THERE WATCHING ME.
DO WE LOOK ALIKE AT ALL, THAT OTHER GIRL AND ME?
NOT REALLY.
WHAT MADE HIM SINGLE HER OUT?
WHAT MADE HIM NOTICE HER IN PARTICULAR?
WELL, EVERYBODY NOTICED HER.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WELL, SHE DANCED.
DANCED...
TO A RECORD?
WITH HER FRIENDS CHEERING HER ON.
SHE WAS SEXY.
YOU DIDN'T DANCE FOR HIM, DID YOU?
SURE.
ON A THURSDAY NIGHT, THE PLACE IS PACKED.
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO BREATHE.
DID ANYTHING UNUSUAL HAPPEN THAT NIGHT?
IT WAS PETER'S BIRTHDAY.
PETER?
I REMEMBER, BECAUSE THE NEXT DAY, AFTER WHAT HAPPENED,
HE TOLD ME I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM THE PRESENT HE WISHED FOR...
HE WANTED ME TO GO HOME WITH HIM.
WHAT HAPPENED THAT WAS SO UNUSUAL?
AT MIDNIGHT...
WE'D GOTTEN HIM A CAKE...
AND AT MIDNIGHT, C.C. AND I BROUGHT IT OUT.
Okay, YOU GUYS!
THIS ONE'S FOR PETER!
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU ♪
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU ♪
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DEAR PETER ♪
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU ♪
YAY!
PETER MADE A WISH AND BLEW OUT ALL THE CANDLES.
AND THEN I KISSED HIM.
YES, I KISSED HIM,
AND SO I KISSED HIM AGAIN, AND THEY CHEERED EVEN LOUDER.
WHOA!
THEN HE KISSED ME.
I MEAN HE REALLY KISSED ME,
AND EVERYBODY WENT CRAZY.
BUT YOU DON'T REMEMBER HIM THERE, HENDERSON?
AT THAT OTHER BAR, EITHER, THE ONE WHERE YOU SAW HIM.
ANOTHER BEER?
YEAH.
TWO VICTIMS.
BOTH YOUNG, BOTH PRETTY.
BOTH WERE IN BARS WHERE THEY COULD BE WATCHED BY HIM,
AND BOTH DID SOMETHING THAT MADE THEM THE CENTER OF ATTENTION.
MAYBE HE GETS EXCITED, TOO, BUT HE WANTS TO KILL.
WHAT A GUY.
WHAT CAN I DO?
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES WITH THE POLICE.
DO YOU KNOW ANY LAWYERS?
YEAH, A GUY I USED TO GO TO SCHOOL WITH.
I THOUGHT I'D GIVE HIM A CALL.
IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO GO IN WITH SOMEBODY.
YOU CAN STAY HERE TONIGHT IF YOU WANT...
ON THE COUCH.
CALL HIM IN THE MORNING.
DID YOU LOVE HER?
SYLVIA?
LOVE...
I DIDN'T REALLY EVEN KNOW HER, AS WE'VE SEEN.
I WAS JUST SOMETHING FOR HER TO DO.
I CAN THINK OF WORSE THINGS TO DO.
HERE.
YOU'RE AWAKE.
WHAT TIME IS IT?
ABOUT 4:30.
LISTEN...
WHY DON'T YOU COME INTO MY ROOM?
I'D LIKE YOU TO.
I FIND YOU ATTRACTIVE.
I MEAN, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
THAT IS TRUE, BUT...
THAT'S NOT THE REAL REASON.
EVER SINCE THAT NIGHT,
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO...
TO DO CERTAIN THINGS.
TONIGHT, I THINK I COULD,
I MEAN, IF YOU...
WANT TO.
COME HERE.
COME HERE.
THERE'S A BED IN THERE.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS?
NOTHING, I GUESS.
TERRY?
COME HERE.
WHAT'S WRONG?
WAIT A SECOND.
THINGS ARE DEFINITELY LOOKING BETTER TO ME THIS MORNING.
ME, TOO.
I WAS THINKING.
ABOUT IT BEING ONLY A MATTER OF TIME WITH HENDERSON,
AND SOONER OR LATER, HE'LL KILL AGAIN?
YEAH.
AND THAT WOULD CLEAR UP YOUR PROBLEM?
IT COULD HAPPEN SOONER INSTEAD OF LATER,
WITH A LITTLE HELP.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THINK ABOUT IT.
SOME GIRL WHO COULD INADVERTENTLY PUSH HIS BUTTONS.
THAT COULD TAKE A LONG TIME.
WHAT IF SOME GIRL WHO KNEW WHAT BUTTONS TO PUSH
DELIBERATELY SET ABOUT PUSHING THEM?
A GIRL WHO WAS HIS TYPE?
FORGET IT.
WHY?
I WON'T LET YOU.
WHY?
IT'S DANGEROUS.
NOT IF YOU HELP.
WE WON'T LET IT BE.
NO.
I SAID FORGET IT.
THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE THE OFFER.
IT'S NO MORE THAN YOU DID FOR HER.
THAT I WAS EITHER A ROMANTIC FOOL OR AN IDIOT.
I WAS PROBABLY BOTH.
YOU KNOW, IF I WANT TO AHEAD, YOU COULDN'T STOP ME.
YOU'D BE IN CUSTODY, REMEMBER?
BUT I DO HAVE MY OWN REASONS FOR WANTING HIM CAUGHT.
HE ASSAULTED ME.
IF I THOUGHT YOU WERE SERIOUS...
IT WOULD NEVER WORK.
HE WOULDN'T GO FOR YOU AGAIN.
HE'D KNOW IT WAS A TRAP.
NOT IF HE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE ME.
YOU JUST DON'T THINK I'M SEXY ENOUGH
TO MAKE HIM TRY.
WHY WOULDN'T HE RECOGNIZE YOU?
BECAUSE, TERRY, I'M A WOMAN,
IN CASE YOU STILL HAVEN'T NOTICED.
HOW DO I LOOK?
UH, DETECTIVE QUIRKE, IT'S TERRY LAMBERT.
NEVER MIND THAT NOW.
YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG.
UH, I WANT TO GIVE MYSELF UP.
I DO, BUT JUST TO YOU...
AND DETECTIVE JESSUP.
WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT YOU TO DO.
NO, NOT NOW.
TONIGHT.
LOOK, ONE MORE DAY WON'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
LOOK, JUST BE AT THIS NUMBER AFTER 10:00.
I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT THEN.
JUST BE THERE.
WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR EYEBROWS?
DYED.
FAKE EYELASHES.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
YEAH.
YEAH.
WHY WOULD HE HAVE TO WORK LATE TONIGHT?
WHY NOT?
WHAT IF HE DOESN'T GO OUT?
WHAT IF HE GOES HOME AFTER WORK?
THEN THAT'S IT.
I CALL QUIRKE.
LOOK.
NOW, REMEMBER.
STAY BACK A LITTLE.
WATCH ME IN YOUR REAR-VIEW MIRROR.
I'LL BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
GO...
YOU BETTER HURRY.
GO.
WE DON'T GET SEPARATED, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.
YOU LOSE ME, STOP AND WAIT FOR ME TO CATCH UP.
BUT BY THEN, HE'D BE...
WE DON'T GET SEPARATED NO MATTER WHAT, AGREED?
AGREED!
COME ON.
COME ON.
COME ON.
COME ON!
NOT ONE OF YOUR BETTER PLACES IN TOWN.
THERE'S A PHONE BOOTH RIGHT BACK THERE.
LET'S GO OVER IT ONE MORE TIME.
I GO IN AND TRY TO SET THE HOOK.
IF IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S GONNA GO FOR IT...
I CALL QUIRKE, TELL HIM WHAT'S HAPPENING,
TO GET OVER TO YOUR PLACE AND MEET ME THERE.
I DRIVE HOME WITH HENDERSON FOLLOWING.
IF HE GOES FOR ME, QUIRKE'S THERE TO SEE IT.
MM-HMM.
YOU HAVE THE MACE?
IT'S IN MY POCKET.
♪ YOU ONCE WAS A SWEET THING, BABY ♪
♪ YOU HELD OUT A LOVIN' HAND ♪
♪ BUT NOW I REACH ♪

Hello.
I wasn't sure you'd come.
I almost didn't, and then I got lost, all turned around.
Nothing looked the same.
Would you like something to drink?
Maybe that would be good.
Some white wine?
Uh.
I'm out of white wine right now.
I've had enough to drink already.
Maybe too much.
How did you get away?
My sister's having problems with her husband.
I told Collin she needed to see me.
At this hour?
It's a crisis.
What did you say?
"Thanks for the party."
Collin won't miss me.
He's your husband.
I just work for him.
I don't know what to say.
I don't either.
I've never...
I know.
Why did you...
Why are you...
Because you want me to.
And have wanted me for a long time.
I was so obvious?
I couldn't ignore it.
And I guess I'm to the point where I need to be wanted like that.
Collin...
Oh, don't tell me Collin knew, too?
If Collin knew...
You know him.
What do you think Collin would do if he knew?
I don't know.
Mmm.
Mmm.
I can't move.
Thank god.
Ha ha!
But I have to.
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
Whew.
Woman:
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Terry!
Uhh!
Aah!
Terry!
What?
Help me!
Help!
What is it?
What happened?
He was trying to kill her.
Who was?
Hey, you.
Are you all right?
He's gone now.
He had her from behind.
He was dragging her toward the street.
There you go.
Take my arm.
Looks like she's all right.
Come on, come on.
Hey, they can see you.
He was trying to kill her.
To realize it was really happening.
Did you see him?
Yes.
His face was so white.
Oh.
okay.
Okay.
Okay.
I've got to get out of here.
I'll walk you to your car.
20, 24... with unbelievable white skin and red hair combed back like a duck.
A duck tail.
Yes.
That could've been me down there.
You may have saved my life.
The pleasure was mine.
In fact, let me go further.
If I can be of service again...
Oh, don't.
I can't even think about that now.
I'm scared and later than I should be, and that could be trouble for us both.
Any regrets?
Not one.
In spite of what happened, maybe because of it, it's the most exciting night
I can remember.
You?
Regrets?
are you kidding?
All right!
Ha ha ha ha!
Rough night last night?
You're late.
Thought maybe you slept in.
He's been asking for you.
Collin?
Good luck.
I want the concrete on the site.
If I get there and find my boys sitting around pulling their puds...
What happened to you last night?
Well, see to it that you do.
Every last yard of it.
Party.
Where did you disappear to?
Oh, nowhere.
I went home.
And the next thing I knew you were gone.
What's that?
It's a beauty, isn't it?
Belonged to bugsy segal.
40 years old, never been registered.
Where did you get it?
A friend.
Got it from a friend.
Hold it.
Feels good, doesn't it?
The way it fits in your hand.
Almost makes you wish you had a reason to fire it.
Excuse me.
Your paper.
Ahem.
Thank you.
Hi, Terry.
Hi, lilla.
Well, the market's looking up.
How are things coming on the wooton project?
Hello?
In fact, I'd better get back to it right now.
May I?
Be my guest.
What's so interesting?
Looks like the mideast is heating up again.
Well, you see, that's why I never read the news.
Right.
What do you think about it...
The girl in the news?
A few blocks away, less than half an hour later.
I think there's a good chance not the same girl, though.
Mm-mmm.
You said the one you saw had brown hair.
Mmm.
God, it's scary.
Did the paper say anything else about witnesses?
Said there weren't any.
Mmm.
Terry, if it was the same man and no one else saw him,
I should go forward, give the police a description.
Mm-hmm.
you could ask them to keep your identity a secret.
What if they wouldn't?
It will all come out.
What about a letter?
No, they wouldn't pay much attention to it.
They would think it was from some crank.
Oh, Jesus, Terry, I want to do the right thing.
Why should my life be turned upside-down just because I happened to look out of a window?
It's not fair.
Mm-mmm.
Am I terrible?
No.
What are you doing?
Police department, please.
Aah!
Terry!
I'll tell them what you saw, only I'll tell them that I saw it.
Why shouldn't I have been the one looking out of it?
Hello?
Yes.
I witnessed an assault last night... okay.
They'll probably make a hero out of me.
But you'll be lying.
Hello?
And I thought I'd better call up about it.
Right outside my apartment near the Washington monument.
12 east mount Vernon place.
Terry lambert.
Sure.
That's the most romantic thing
I've ever seen in my life.
You did that for me.
You remember what he looked like?
Mm-hmm.
Tell me what he looked like.
Tall, red hair.
Mm-hmm.
Yes, combed back behind the ears like this.
Mm-hmm.
What was he wearing?
Uh, tan jacket and blue jeans, tennis shoes.
When you say tennis shoes, you mean tennis shoes or running shoes?
I mean tennis shoes.
And I'm going to make love to you like nobody ever has before.
But I'm not sure we'll have time before they get here.
Get here?
Terry!
Mm-hmm.
Some detective.
He sounded very excited, actually.
Oh, my god.
Ha ha ha.
Terry, you're gonna pay for this.
No, you'd better not.
Collin might be home.
On the other side of the Washington monument in an hour.
I'm detective quirke, and this is detective Jessup.
May we come in?
Yeah, sure.
I'm sorry.
Nice apartment.
I like these old buildings.
Mm-hmm.
You live here alone?
Yes.
Why?
Detective Jessup will take notes, if you don't mind.
What happened, what you were doing, what you saw.
Well, I'd been to a party, kind of an office party...
Office?
Wentworth construction.
Collin wentworth?
You work for him?
Yeah.
Anyway, we just closed a big account, and we were having a party to celebrate.
I came home early and went to bed.
Around 10:00.
Then later, at 2:15...
I remember, 'cause I looked at the clock...
I heard a scream, not very loud, but I could tell it came from the park.
I jumped up and I went to the window.
Which window?
The bedroom window.
May we see it?
Mm-hmm.
Were the drapes open?
Yes.
And what did you see?
Right down there.
He had her from behind and was sort of dragging her toward the street.
Uh, she was struggling.
And then he threw her down and that's when she screamed real loud, "help!
Help me!"
And then he ran away.
Why didn't you call the police?
I didn't think it was that important, until I read about that other girl that was murdered.
What made you think there was a connection?
A few blocks away, half hour later.
No, Mr. lambert, we think there's a connection, too.
And we're very glad you came forward.
Cigarette?
no, don't smoke.
Good for you.
Do you mind?
Did you get a good look at the assailant?
Yes.
Describe him, please.
Young, early 20s, 6-foot.
Any distinguishing marks or characteristics?
Red hair, red hair, combed back behind the ears in a duck tail.
Tan jacket, blue jeans, tennis shoes.
Tennis shoes or running shoes?
Tennis shoes.
When you say tan jacket, do you mean a sports coat or a windbreaker?
Windbreaker.
You have a good eye for detail, Mr. lambert.
He probably came from behind that tree.
The girl says the sidewalk was deserted, that he came out of nowhere.
She barely saw him at all.
By the way, do you know her?
The girl.
She lives around the corner.
Ahem!
No.
She's a lucky one.
The other girl was raped, beaten to death, and dumped.
You said he was dragging her toward the street, and he was trying to get her to his vehicle.
She's a lucky one, all right.
Mr. lambert, you said you came back from the party, went right to bed?
That's right.
Were you alone?
Yes.
Didn't I say that?
Not exactly.
I was alone.
That's why he went to sleep, Dave.
Just wanted to make sure.
Aah!
Did you mean windbreaker or sports coat?
Windbreaker.
Why?
I was so nervous.
I didn't know what to do.
Tell me what happened.
There's something I want to see.
That's where she lived, the girl that was killed.
Come on, I'll show you.
This one was attacked on her way home, too.
But if it happened so soon after, how did he plan it?
How did he know where she lived?
I suppose he came driving down this street.
You know, he's...
He's angry.
Excuse me, please.
Okay.
He's frustrated after his aborted attempt outside of my place.
He stops at that stop sign right there.
Looking over, he sees a car parked in the red in front of this building.
He sees a girl locked in the arms of her lover, having a last good night kiss.
On impulse, the killer backs up.
He sees the side door of the building, he parks, and returns on foot.
He's guessed that the girl lives in the building.
That soon she'll be going inside.
He runs up the steps to the front door, where he does something to the lock something that'll prevent the key from opening it.
And he slips back down the steps to the side door to watch and to wait.
The girl gets out of the car, waves good-bye, goes up the steps.
She tries to open the door, but she can't.
She turns to call after her lover, but he's already speeding away.
So she decides to go around to the side door.
The police told you all that...
About the girl?
Most of it.
The rest was in the paper.
I want you to know I really appreciate you helping me do the right thing, giving the police the description.
Let's hope it's of some use to them.
When will I see you again?
Soon.
Very soon.
There you go.
Hey, what's in the bag?
A little lunch time shopping?
Uh, just some white wine.
Have you been up to something you shouldn't, old boy?
What do you mean?
Cop was here to see you.
Detective Jessup.
He wants you to call him at that number.
Thanks, Collin.
Well, what's it all about?
Nothing much.
A few nights ago,
I witnessed an assault on this girl.
Sounds interesting.
Not a rape, Collin, more of a mugging.
No big deal.
Which night?
Which night?
Yeah, which night was it?
Thursday night.
That was the night of the party.
Yeah, that's right.
Well?
Aren't you going to call 'em?
Yes,
I'm going to call 'em.
It's Terry lambert, detective Jessup.
Certainly. 7:00?
That will be fine.
Probably go over my statement again.
You know the police.
Frankly, I'm surprised to see you get so involved.
I didn't know you had such a strong sense of civic duty.
Hey!
I didn't know you appreciated French wine, either.
I'm developing a taste for it.
Just tell me what you want.
Yeah, okay.
Just a sec.
Yes?
I'm here to see detective Jessup.
They're running late.
If you have a seat, they'll have it set up in a few minutes.
Yeah.
Burglary.
Uh-huh.
No.
Of course.
Yes, thanks.
All right, hold on.
Late setting what up?
You said they were running late setting something up.
You're here for the line-up, aren't you?
The line-up?
Yes.
No, I think I was supposed to just come down...
You must be the one.
I mean, they told me there was a witness.
Yes.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Oh, hi.
Of course, you two must have but I'll have to ask you to refrain from doing so during the proceedings.
Right this way.
Now there are 6 men I want you to look at.
Don't worry.
They won't be able to see you.
I don't want to disappoint you, because sometimes people see more than they realize.
But Mr. lambert here, he got a good look at the man.
You did?
Well, I, uh...
Jessup:
Step right up, gentlemen.
Don't be shy.
That's right.
All the way to the end.
Take your time.
Look at each one...
Very carefully.
Face left, gentlemen, please.
But you did get a good look at him that night.
Good enough to give us that detailed description.
But seeing them all together like this,
I just can't be sure.
But surely if you were to come face-to-face with the man you described in such detail, you'd recognize him, wouldn't you?
Yes, I think so.
That's the way it goes.
Your hunch was wrong.
One of the men you saw tonight has done this kind of thing before.
That, combined with your description...
Well, obviously I was wrong.
We'll just have to keep looking.
Sorry.
I'm sorry you didn't recognize him.
Yeah, me, too.
I've seen you before...
At Edgar's.
I don't think...
I cocktail there.
It's not my night for recognizing people.
I was walking home from work the night it happened.
I don't do that anymore.
There's a lot I don't do.
Can't do till I know who he is.
They seem pretty sure that the same guy attacked that other girl.
Only she's dead, and I'm alive.
I should feel lucky, I guess.
Do you think they'll catch him?
I hope so.
Well, good night.
He's not even telling her about it.
You'll see when he takes his hood off.
What if it is him?
What do we do?
First, you'll have to tell me whether it is.
Terry, there must be hundreds of young men in Baltimore with red hair.
I don't know why you think...
There!
Look.
Man:
You can't weld it down here.
I want you to have a better look.
That's him, isn't it?
Come on, Sylvia.
He's just what you said, the hair, the size, everything.
Even the white skin.
I can't say.
Not for sure.
Why not?
I just can't.
But it might be him.
It might be.
But what good does that do?
What good does any of it do?
I couldn't go forward before.
It would be worse now.
If he did what he did to those girls but we don't know it, Terry.
I am not sure.
That detective quirke...
He said that one of the men in the line-up was there because he had raped before.
But you don't know this is the one he was talking about.
I'm sorry, Terry.
I know you're disappointed, but there's nothing I can do about it.
I'll tell you what.
Let's not spend our time driving around, okay?
Okay.
Can I get you something from the bar?
Uh, yeah.
A beer.
Draft?
Yeah.
Hey.
Oh.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Whoa!
Yeah!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Good lord, have mercy.

And me, making a fool of myself.
Here, watch this.
Ready for another?
No, thanks.
Oh!
Oh, my god!
Oh!
That's all right.
No, really.
Let me buy you a drink.
It's the least I can do.
It'll make me feel better.
Okay, okay.
It'll make me feel better.
♪ Take me in your arms and make love to me ♪
Don't want to wake them.
No such luck.
Chris, is that you?
You come up here!
I'm tired of you being out till all hours of the night!
I told you to be in this house before midnight!
If this ever happens again, you're packing your things and leaving!
I mean it!
Go on down!
You be quiet about it down there!
That's it.
Get her out of here.
What's going on?
They found her body stuffed in there about an hour ago.
Any idea who she is?
Nah.
What do you think?
Interesting.
Here's Peters.
Is this what time don't start, huh?
I hear you got something.
Peters.
State's attorney's office.
Nice to meet you.
I understand you've told quite a story.
I'd like to ask some questions.
Why didn't you identify Henderson at the line-up?
Henderson?
That's him...
Chris Henderson.
I didn't wanna make a mistake.
At night, to see him under similar circumstances.
Unusually conscientious.
At night you became positive he attacked miss connelly?
Yes.
You still didn't identify him.
You waited... 2 days.
Why?
I don't know.
What do you think?
Have we enough for a search warrant?
With lambert's positive I.D., Henderson's record.
Can I tie Henderson to the dead girls?
She was in a bar last night.
I'll see if anyone there recognizes his picture.
I can probably get the warrant without it, thanks, Mr. lambert.
You've been a big help.
I only wish I had helped sooner.
Even if you'd identified Henderson earlier, they wouldn't have arrested him.
He'd of still been out on the street last night.
Our concern isn't the assault itself...
Except as it helps to build a murder case.
And thanks to you, it's helping.
Maybe we'll tie Henderson to the dead girls.
If we do, we're off and running.
Don't torture yourself about what might have been.
What you did was right, there's no doubt.
I just wish you hadn't had to do it.
He could come back and hurt us.
My statement's only a tool for their search warrant.
Beyond that, they don't care about me you didn't tell them you followed him to the bar?
Either I recognized him at night or I didn't.
I had no reason to follow him.
Suppose they discover you lied?
They don't care about me.
I promise I won't let them find out about you.
Hello?
Oh, how are you, detective quirke?
I see.
Thanks for letting me know.
Good luck to you.
What?
What did he want?
They got the search warrant.
Isn't that what you wanted?
I guess so, but...
Nobody at the bar remembered Henderson.
But they've got the warrant anyway?
Yeah.
My statement was enough.
That'll be the end of it.
To connect him to the murders or they won't.
They're done with me.
The search was somewhat disappointing.
No fingerprints, no blood samples, no clothing.
Nothing to prove Henderson ever came in contact some cotton fibers match the sweater of one girl, but it's common fiber.
We found some peppermint-flavored toothpicks in the truck's glove compartment.
Each girl was prevented from entering her residence by a toothpick jammed into the keyhole and then broken off the newspapers mentioned jammed locks.
We held back about the toothpicks.
So what happens now?
I'll let Peters explain.
Jesus, that Holden's a breaking judge.
Have you filled him in?
I was just starting to.
We got a murder case we can't win, some insignificant cotton fibers, some toothpicks anyone could possess.
My assistant learned that brand is given away in lots of Baltimore restaurants.
So he didn't do it?
He could have raped the girls, hammered them to death with his fist.
He could have thrown away the gloves he wore, any articles of clothing with blood on them.
A car wash would have cleaned his truck.
Whew!
What I'm saying is we can't prove that he did it.
So detective quirke and I have agreed to go with the assault case.
We prosecute Henderson on the assault case.
We can win that.
It's open and shut.
We got a witness who saw him do it... you.
You said you didn't care about the assault.
I don't if there's a chance for murder, but we're up against it.
We aren't giving up on the murder cases.
We might get lucky when he's in prison.
You mean someone may kill him?
I doubt that lucky.
I meant Henderson might shoot off his mouth to somebody who wants to make a deal.
Meanwhile, he doesn't hurt anyone.
How about being a star witness?
I...
This isn't what I thought would happen.
Don't worry.
It'll be a breeze.
All you've got to do is tell the truth.
You said that would not happen.
You'll have to testify under oath.
How do you think I feel?
Why did I have to look out that window?
Why did you have to call the police?
If he's not put away, he could kill again.
All he's being tried for is assault.
What a mess.
It's not your mess.
It's mine.
I'll protect you from it.
So far, all you've done is grandstand.
First for me, and now for them.
You believe that?
You wanted to be the hero.
See where it's gotten us?
I am the one with everything to lose!
Sylvia.
Hey.
I thought it was you.
How long... what are you doing?
What does it look like?
I'll walk a while if you like.
Oh, I'm...
I'm going.
I was happy to hear they're going to prosecute what happened?
You thought about it later and were sure?
Something like that.
I'm better.
I'm doing things like this now.
I used to run at night.
Mostly I'm just waiting to testify.
It's all I think about.
I'm nervous.
Are you?
Your testimony is much more important than mine.
Even if I have to get up on the stand, I want to get him.
You must feel the same way.
Yeah.
I just want to tell you how much it means to me to see someone who's not afraid to come forward.
I'm not doing so much.
You're telling the truth.
That's more than most people would do.
See you in court.
Oh, Terry, I'm so ashamed.
Do you hate me?
Of course I want to stand by you.
I'm just scared.
So am I.
You forgive me?
Do you?
Let's go upstairs.
I want to.
I didn't.
And I want to come to the trial.
When you testify, you'll be testifying for both of us.
You'll be saying the words, but they'll be my words.
I'll be right there with you.
This way.
State your name for the court, please.
You swear the evidence you're about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
Yes.
Please take the stand.
This won't take long.
What were you doing on April 21st at 2:15 A.M.?
Looking out my bedroom window.
Your bedroom overlooks the park?
Yes.
A man fighting with a woman.
Physically fighting?
Would you describe as exactly as you are able he had hold of her from behind, trying to drag her...
Objection.
Conclusion.
Sustained.
Was he dragging her?
Yes, toward the street.
Then what happened?
He threw her down on her face, grabbed hold of her neck, and started to strangle her.
What did you do?
I went to yell out my window.
She screamed, and he ran away.
I'd like you to look around this courtroom.
Do you see the man you saw attack that girl?
Yes.
Please point him out.
Let the record show the witness is pointing at the defendant.
You are sure the defendant is the man you saw?
Yes, I am.
Thank you, Mr. lambert.
One moment, Mr. lambert.
There are two lawyers in this case.
Yes, I would like to take you through this one more time.
Perhaps in a little more detail.
You were in your apartment on east mount Vernon place.
You looked out your window and you saw a man fighting with a woman.
Yes.
What time was that?
What were you doing just prior to looking out the window?
Just prior?
Were you watching television?
Reading?
chatting with friends?
Sleeping.
In your bed?
Yes.
Not in a chair?
No, I was in my bed.
When did you go to bed?
Around 11:00.
You had been to a party that night, correct?
Yes.
Did you have much to drink?
No.
I left early.
I had been working hard and was tired.
So you went home to get some sleep.
You're sound asleep at 2:00 A.M.
What woke you up?
I heard a scream.
There were two muffled screams.
What did you do?
I went to the window.
Did you turn on a light?
Did you stop to get some milk?
And that's when you saw this man and woman fighting.
I went to open the window, but it stuck.
The woman screamed, did he run away as soon as she screamed?
She screamed twice, "help!
Help me!"
And the man ran away, I think.
Well, it all happened pretty quickly.
How quickly?
What?
You saw these people fighting.
The woman screamed, the man ran away.
It happened very quickly.
How quickly?
Five seconds?
Uh... it must have been longer than that.
For all that to happen.
Yeah.
Why don't we just say that you saw this man for a brief time period, during most of which he was moving quickly.
Would that be an accurate statement?
How far is it from your window to the fountain steps?
15 yards?
It's 22 yards.
It's 22 yards.
I never measured.
Well, we did measure it.
The night of April 21st, was that a clear night?
It was pretty clear.
So visibility was good.
There are streetlights also.
There are three, spaced along the block.
Yes.
The park's well-lit.
Well-lit?
Oh, yes.
As well-lit as this courtroom?
No.
You're sure?
Of course.
Of course you're sure.
Your honor, with your permission, objection, your honor.
What kind of experiment?
This experiment is relevant?
Yes.
It'll take two minutes.
The court can indulge defense counsel for two minutes.
Thank you, your honor.
One thing before we begin...
Mr. lambert, would you remove your contact lenses?
Your contact lenses.
You're wearing them, aren't you?
Yes.
Then kindly remove them.
Mr. lambert wears hard contact lenses.
That's true, isn't it?
They're irritating if you sleep with them in.
He would have taken them out that night.
Isn't that true?
He just said that when he was awakened by screams, he hurried to the window without making any stops.
Surely he won't now say he put in contact lenses.
Will you?
No, I didn't have them in.
So I repeat my request that you remove them.
I think you'd better remove them.
Here.
No, I, uh...
I have a lens case.
Now, Mr. lambert, the distance between us from your bedroom window to the fountain steps.
Turn out the lights.
Objection.
If we are to re-create the circumstances under which the witness observed the defendant, surely it should be done properly, by experts.
Let's indulge defense counselor for two minutes.
Frankly, I'm curious as to where this is heading.
Proceed.
Thank you, your honor.
Mr. lambert, I'm holding in my hand an object.
Could you kindly tell the court what this object is?
It's a...
You're holding, um...
Come on, Mr. lambert.
What is it?
I can't quite make it out.
Come on, Mr. lambert.
What is it?
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Help!
Help me!
Shall I give you a hint, Mr. lambert?
Is it a cap?
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Is it a lady's slipper?
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Is it a red wig?
Well, let's try it with the lights on.
How about now, Mr. lambert?
I can see...
I can see that something's there.
But you can't identify it, not even with the lights on.
Just a book, Mr. lambert.
Just a red book.
I see why motor vehicles stipulates that you can't drive without glasses or contacts.
You're shortsighted.
Yes.
In fact, you're extremely shortsighted.
I don't know about extremely.
Wouldn't you agree that a person who failed to distinguish an object in a brightly lit courtroom from 20 yards away could fairly be described as extremely shortsighted?
Yes.
Wouldn't you also agree that it would be unlikely that an extremely shortsighted person could positively identify someone glimpsed at night from 22 yards away for only a few seconds?
You never said you're nearsighted!
You never asked.
With motor vehicle registration!
Accused assailant Chris Henderson the case against him dismissed for insufficient evidence.
Baltimore police report no new leads in the so-called dumpster murders.
Could I talk to you, please?
I'm your neighbor.
It's funny how two people can live so close and...
My name is Kathy.
Kathy hoffner.
Terry lambert.
Oh, please excuse the way I look.
I'm such a slob today.
I heard your footsteps on the stairs, and I thought it was probably you, so I just threw this on and came out.
Well, I'm just getting home.
I didn't know whether to say anything,
I feel funny about talking behind people's backs.
Talk to who?
The police.
The police.
Oh, you mean back then.
I talked to them back then, too.
They asked me if I was awakened by the attack.
They were here again today.
Today?
They asked me if I saw you that night.
Seen me?
First I thought I hadn't.
Then I remembered that I had peeked out when I heard footsteps coming up the stairs.
I was nervous after what had happened.
What did you see?
I saw you coming back in.
This was later, after the excitement had died down.
I went out for some air.
Did you see me go out?
The police asked me the same question.
I just saw you coming in.
Must have been after 3:00.
Oh, I'm sure it wasn't that late.
No.
Thanks for letting me know about the police.
Anytime.
anytime at all.
You heard they let him go.
It's sickening, isn't it?
Want a beer?
Thanks.
I would.
So that's the famous bedroom window?
Yeah.
Do you mind?
I know, Terry.
What?
It wasn't you in the bedroom window.
She was the witness.
She saw it, not you.
Who?
I'm sorry they let him go.
But you went forward...
Save it, Terry!
I saw her in the park, and I saw her in court coaching you.
Pathetic.
What, is she married?
Must be, to someone powerful.
It doesn't matter, really.
What matters is he's out there, free.
There's nothing that can be done about that.
They can't try him again.
Not for attacking me, but with some more information, they might be able to get him for what he did to the others, the girls that didn't have someone like you to protect them.
The question isn't what am I going to do, it's what are you going to do and what is she going to do?
Now it's my turn to watch.
Thanks for the beer.
Terry!
The cops have been here.
They just left.
Here?
They want me to call them?
They don't want to talk to you...
They wanted to talk about you.
About me?
How long you've been here, what you're like.
They also want to know about the night of that party we had.
What your mood was, why you left early.
It's almost as though they suspect you of something.
Did they ask anything else?
If I'd noticed anything unusual about you on April 26 or 27.
What?
They think you keep a diary of my moods?
Why would they ask about those dates in particular?
Who knows?
Anyway, thanks, Collin.
I'm sorry they bothered you.
The police don't know about you, not yet.
They've been questioning my neighbors.
I think they've tapped my phone.
They've been watching me.
She saw you in court.
She's figured it out.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Terry, you made a mistake, a simple mistake.
The police wouldn't do that.
They were at the office this morning questioning Collin.
Collin?
that's right.
Why would they question Collin?
About me!
Sylvia!
That's what I'm trying to tell you!
Do they suspect you were...
With somebody?
I don't know what they suspect.
It looks like they're wondering if maybe I didn't kill those girls.
They're trying to put the blame on somebody else.
It's ridiculous.
You're being paranoid.
Anyway, what did they talk to Collin about?
They asked about April 26, that's the date of the second murder.
They also asked him about the night of the party...
Why I left early.
The party?
What if Collin starts thinking about the party?
Well, one way, that would partially solve our problems.
What do you mean?
You wouldn't need to be so afraid to go to the police.
Go to the police?
I can't do that.
You know that.
You've always known.
Besides, I think you're exaggerating the whole thing.
What about the redhead, Henderson?
If you'd testified, he wouldn't have.
I never said it was him.
I was never sure.
You made up your own mind about that.
If it was him, he could do it again.
Stop it, Terry.
That's not fair.
It's not my fault this is happening.
Besides, it'll work out.
The police aren't fools.
What about Denise connelly?
Who?
The girl that was attacked!
She knows all about us.
Tell her we need a little time.
I have to think.
She'll be reasonable, won't she?
Maybe.
She has to be.
I didn't get us into this.
You know that.
I have to go now.
I do.
I never even knew you wore contact lenses.
Little reverse english, you'd have done all right, al.
Thanks, Denise.

Now, the police seem to have gotten it into their heads that maybe I had something to do they know you lied.
They just don't know why.
Yeah.
Did you see any of it that night?
She saw it, but she wouldn't go forward, so you took her place.
I thought I could bring it off.
And she let you?
You're either a romantic fool, or you're an idiot.
I don't know which is worse.
What does she say now, now that you're in a spot?
She wants to wait...
Give time to the police to sort it out.
You don't understand her position.
Sure, I do.
She has a husband and a stud on the side, and nobody the wiser.
She wants to keep it that way.
Uh, Denise...
Yeah.
So, what are you going to do now?
If I had it to do over, I'd do it differently.
But it was my idea to handle it the way we did, and I just don't think it's fair for me unless she's come to the same conclusion I have.
Like I said, a romantic fool.
What about Henderson?
She's not sure it was Henderson, and she never was.
But you were sure.
That doesn't make any sense.
And I'd like to tell it to you someday.
I would.
But right now, Denise, all I want is a little more time.
Denise, seriously.
Come on.
But I'm giving the time to you, not to her.

Child:
I've got it!
Ha ha ha!
Mr. lambert?
Good morning.
Would you mind coming with me?
Detective quirke and I would like to talk to you for a few minutes.
Shall I follow you?
That's okay.
I'll bring you back.
Mr. lambert.
Seems you haven't been exactly truthful with us.
Oh, yes.
I'm sorry about the contacts.
That's our fault.
We should have asked.
I'm not talking about that.
We've learned that you went out that night.
You told us you were in bed.
Yes.
That you were awakened, you witnessed the attack, and then you went right back to bed.
Yes, I did go out.
I...
I forgot.
You forgot?
Yes, I...
Yeah, I did.
It's...
When did you go out?
Uh, afterward, before I went back to sleep.
I went to get some air and look around.
I was all keyed up.
It's...
When did you come back?
A few minutes later.
That's why I forgot.
Look, I know that you've been questioning my neighbors and my boss, and you've been having me followed, but I...
Look, you don't really think that I'm...
I'm not a suspect, am I?
Suppose you tell us about the bar.
What bar?
Where the murdered girl Stephanie lugie spent the last hours of her life, where no one...
No one...
Can remember having seen the redhead Chris Henderson.
Cocktail waitress remembers you quite clearly.
She spilled a drink on you.
Was that something else you forgot?
Where did you get that picture?
Am I...
Are you arresting me?
No.
Not just yet.
We're moving a little slower this time around.
I don't think I should answer any more questions until I consult an attorney.
That might be well-advised.
Hello.
What are you doing?
You can't just call here!
We have to talk.
That's impossible!
I have to see you right away.
No!
I can't see you.
I can't see you at all anymore.
I've been to the police.
They've been questioning me.
It doesn't matter.
I can't see you, and I can't talk to you.
Sylvia, don't make me...
I have to go now.
Don't hang up on me!
Goodbye!
Who was that, dear?
Terry.
Terry lambert.
Tell Mrs. wentworth it's Terry lambert.
Was she expecting you?
I'm sorry, but she isn't here.
You tell her, or shall I?
She's not here.
No one's here.
Where are they?
Damn it!
Where have they gone?
The ballet.
They've gone to the ballet.
I don't know.
Listen, I'm going to talk with him.
What are you doing here?
You gave me no choice.
Are you crazy?
People will see us!
We've gone past where any of that matters.
You may have.
I haven't.
Our affair, the fact that you witnessed the attack...
I've told you...
I will never, never
Sylvia!
I've told you that from the start!
Shh!
Don't touch me!
They suspect me of murder.
I've been followed.
They may have followed me here.
They may be watching me right now.
Then you leave me no choice but to talk to Collin myself.
I'm sorry, Terry, but it's too late for that.
I've already told him.
I had a feeling...
Told him what?
That I went to bed with you... once.
On condition I swear I was in bed with him the night of the party.
He doesn't want to be dragged into that mess!
I told him I would.
Hey!
are you all right?
Yeah, thank you.
I'm fine.
I had to.
I had no choice.
And I told him you'd been after me ever since to continue the affair, to say I was with you when I wasn't.
You'll have to find some other way to solve your problems.
There is no other way.
With or without you, I'm going to the police.
Well, you do what you have to do...
And I'll do what I have to do.
Goodbye.
It was him, wasn't it?
The redhead?
Let go of me, please.
You were sure, weren't you, right from the beginning?
You were sure it was Henderson.
All right.
I was sure!
Of course I was sure.
There's nothing wrong with my eyes.
The act is almost over.
It would be better to wait.
Of course.
What's going on?
Oh!
Mmm mmm mmm!
Ah!
Ah... ah...
Sylvia!
You bastard!
Grab him!
He stabbed my wife!
Unh!
Get him!
Aah!
Oh!
Oh, god!
Aah!
He killed my wife!
Stop him!
Aah!
Call the police!
Aah!
aah!
Get him!
Get him!
Aah!
aah!
He's the killer!
You're not supposed to be back here.
Hey!
Security!
Get security!
Yeah...
The back door.
Tonight the Baltimore social community is shocked over the murder of one of its own.
But police refuse to speculate here at the townsend theater is connected to the so-called dumpster murders.
An employee of the dead woman's husband,
Collin wentworth, was a witness to an earlier related assault.
Police are seeking him for questioning.
Thank you, Craig, for that live minicam report.
Hundreds of schoolchildren swarmed aboard the tall ship...
Denise...
Oh!
Oh!
Ow!
Denise!
Oh, my god.
I don't believe it.
Well, here it is.
Good night.
Yeah.
Thanks, Peter.
Good night.
So, what do you want me to do?
I'll tell them everything and try to get them to believe me.
You'd seen us together.
You saw Sylvia at the trial.
Why shouldn't she be at the trial?
But Denise, you know she was the real witness.
I can say I think that.
I can't prove it.
Those people at the townsend theater will say they think you killed her.
I led him straight to her.
I knew I was being followed, but not that it was Henderson.
And he couldn't have planned it better.
He got rid of the one person that could implicate him and the one person that could clear me.
So now it looks like I was trying to shift the blame from the beginning.
Let's go upstairs.
Want a beer?
Yeah.
Tell me something.
You didn't suspect me like the police.
Why?
I knew something the police didn't.
Remember the first time we met?
The line-up?
How could I forget?
I knew something was wrong even then.
It was obvious you'd never seen me before, from your bedroom window or anyplace else, and you were completely indifferent to what you did see.
Not flattering, perhaps, but upon reflection, trustworthy.
You weren't interested in fucking me, and you certainly weren't interested in killing me.
You weren't interested, period.
He'll do it again, you know.
Kill some girl, or try to.
I'll be safe in jail.
The perfect alibi.
I wonder what sets him off.
Between the 2 of us, we know more about it than anybody.
You were there that night at the bar when he picked out that sorority girl.
The night he attacked me, I don't remember him at the bar, but he was probably there watching me.
Do we look alike at all, that other girl and me?
Not really.
What made him single her out?
What made him notice her in particular?
Well, everybody noticed her.
What do you mean?
Well, she danced.
Danced...
to a record?
With her friends cheering her on.
She was sexy.
You didn't dance for him, did you?
Sure.
On a Thursday night, the place is packed.
I don't have time to breathe.
Did anything unusual happen that night?
It was Peter's birthday.
Peter?
I remember, because the next day, after what happened, he told me I should have given him the present he wished for...
He wanted me to go home with him.
What happened that was so unusual?
At midnight...
We'd gotten him a cake...
And at midnight, c.C. And I brought it out.
Okay, you guys!
This one's for Peter!
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday, dear Peter ♪
♪ happy birthday to you ♪
Yay!
Peter made a wish and blew out all the candles.
And then I kissed him.
Yes, I kissed him, and so I kissed him again, and they cheered even louder.
Whoa!
Then he kissed me.
I mean he really kissed me, and everybody went crazy.
But you don't remember him there, Henderson?
At that other bar, either, the one where you saw him.
Another beer?
Yeah.
Two victims.
Both young, both pretty.
Both were in bars where they could be watched by him, and both did something that made them the center of attention.
Maybe he gets excited, too, but he wants to kill.
What a guy.
What can I do?
I'll take my chances with the police.
Do you know any lawyers?
Yeah, a guy I used to go to school with.
I thought I'd give him a call.
It might be better to go in with somebody.
You can stay here tonight if you want...
On the couch.
Call him in the morning.
Did you love her?
Sylvia?
Love...
I didn't really even know her, as we've seen.
I was just something for her to do.
I can think of worse things to do.
Here.
You're awake.
What time is it?
About 4:30.
Listen... why don't you come into my room?
I'd like you to.
I find you attractive.
I mean, that's not true.
That is true, but...
That's not the real reason.
Ever since that night,
I haven't been able to...
To do certain things.
Tonight, I think I could,
I mean, if you... want to.
Come here.
Come here.
There's a bed in there.
What's wrong with this?
Nothing, I guess.
Terry?
Come here.
What's wrong?
Wait a second.
Things are definitely looking better to me this morning.
Me, too.
I was thinking.
About it being only a matter of time with Henderson, and sooner or later, he'll kill again?
Yeah.
And that would clear up your problem?
It could happen sooner instead of later, with a little help.
What do you mean?
Think about it.
Some girl who could inadvertently push his buttons.
That could take a long time.
What if some girl who knew what buttons to push deliberately set about pushing them?
A girl who was his type?
Forget it.
Why?
I won't let you.
Why?
It's dangerous.
Not if you help.
We won't let it be.
No.
I said forget it.
Thank you.
I appreciate the offer.
It's no more than you did for her.
That I was either a romantic fool or an idiot.
I was probably both.
You know, if I want to ahead, you couldn't stop me.
You'd be in custody, remember?
But I do have my own reasons for wanting him caught.
He assaulted me.
If I thought you were serious...
It would never work.
He wouldn't go for you again.
He'd know it was a trap.
Not if he didn't recognize me.
You just don't think I'm sexy enough to make him try.
Why wouldn't he recognize you?
Because, Terry, I'm a woman, in case you still haven't noticed.
How do I look?
Uh, detective quirke, it's Terry lambert.
Never mind that now.
You've got it all wrong.
Uh, I want to give myself up.
I do, but just to you...
And detective Jessup.
Well, there's something I want you to do.
No, not now.
Tonight.
Look, one more day won't make a difference.
Look, just be at this number after 10:00.
I'll tell you about it then.
Just be there.
What did you do to your eyebrows?
Dyed.
fake eyelashes.
What do you think?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Why would he have to work late tonight?
Why not?
What if he doesn't go out?
What if he goes home after work?
Then that's it.
I call quirke.
Look.
Now, remember.
Stay back a little.
Watch me in your rear-view mirror.
I'll be right behind you.
Go...
You better hurry.
Go.
We don't get separated, no matter what happens.
You lose me, stop and wait for me to catch up.
But by then, he'd be...
We don't get separated no matter what, agreed?
Agreed!
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on!
Not one of your better places in town.
There's a phone booth right back there.
Let's go over it one more time.
I go in and try to set the hook.
If it looks like he's gonna go for it...
I call quirke, tell him what's happening, to get over to your place and meet me there.
I drive home with Henderson following.

He'll see you.
I'm calling quirke now.
Why?
How do you know he'll follow me?
He won't.
He knows where you live.
Your wallet.
He saw it.
He did the same thing the other time.
I just didn't remember.
That's how he was able to screw up her lock.
Then he's going for it.

Eight ball in the corner pocket.

Well, I got to go.
I want a rematch.
Next time.
Hey, hey.
How am I gonna win that drink back?
We didn't play for drinks, remember?
Well, you ain't goin' home alone, are you?

Washington street.
Cross street harbor.
Hello?
Can you hear me?
Can anybody hear me?
Hello?
Police frequency.
Clear line.
Listen, I wanna... can I talk to detective quirke?
This is a police frequency.
Clear the line.
Listen, bitch, I know this is a police frequency.
I've just stolen a police car.
Now, let me speak to detective quirke.
Get out of the car you have stolen and go to a telephone.
Can anybody else out there hear me in any other police cars?
Negative.
no one but me.
Then relay this.
This is Terry lambert.
And I'm on my way to Denise connelly's apartment, the address?
7345 monument street.
Quirke knows the building!
Just tell detective quirke!
Tell everybody!
Aah!
Aah!
Uhh!
Uhh!
Help!
Help me!
Somebody!
Uhh!
Aah!
Aah!
Help!
Aah!
Uhh!
You?
!
Get out of here!
Oh!
Uhh!
uhh!
Aaaghh!
Aah!
Aah!
Denise!
I'm okay.
He can't get away.
No, Terry.
They'll think I did this, too!
Terry!
Hey!
Down there!
Help him!
Help him!
Don't shoot!
Oh, shit.
We'd have gotten him anyway, you know.
Eventually, we would have muddled through.
What did you put in his ignition, toothpick?
Paper clip.
Cute.
So what happens now?
There's still the matter of perjury and obstruction of justice.
I'd say he's looking at 10 to 12 years.
Just kidding.
Get yourself a good lawyer.
You seemed like such a levelheaded girl.
That was a stupid play you made tonight.
You're lucky it turned out all right.
You both are.

HELLO.
I WASN'T SURE YOU'D COME.
I ALMOST DIDN'T,
AND THEN I GOT LOST,
ALL TURNED AROUND.
NOTHING LOOKED THE SAME.
WOULD YOU LIKE SOMETHING TO DRINK?
MAYBE THAT WOULD BE GOOD.
SOME WHITE WINE?
UH.
I'M OUT OF WHITE WINE RIGHT NOW.
I'VE HAD ENOUGH TO DRINK ALREADY.
MAYBE TOO MUCH.
HOW DID YOU GET AWAY?
MY SISTER'S HAVING PROBLEMS
WITH HER HUSBAND.
I TOLD COLLIN SHE NEEDED TO SEE ME.
[SCOFFS] AT THIS HOUR?
IT'S A CRISIS.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
"THANKS FOR THE PARTY."
COLLIN WON'T MISS ME.
HE'S YOUR HUSBAND.
I JUST WORK FOR HIM.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
I DON'T EITHER.
I'VE NEVER...
I KNOW.
WHY DID YOU...
WHY ARE YOU...
BECAUSE YOU WANT ME TO.
AND HAVE WANTED ME FOR A LONG TIME.
I WAS SO OBVIOUS?
I COULDN'T IGNORE IT.
AND I GUESS I'M TO THE POINT
WHERE I NEED TO BE WANTED LIKE THAT.
COLLIN...
OH, DON'T TELL ME COLLIN KNEW, TOO?
IF COLLIN KNEW...
YOU KNOW HIM.
WHAT DO YOU THINK COLLIN WOULD DO IF HE KNEW?
I DON'T KNOW.
MMM.
MMM.
I CAN'T MOVE.
THANK GOD.
HA HA!
BUT I HAVE TO.
EXCUSE ME.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

TERRY!
[GRUNTING]
UHH!
AAH!
TERRY!
WHAT?
HELP ME!
HELP!
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT HAPPENED?
HE WAS TRYING TO KILL HER.
[CRYING]
WHO WAS?
HEY, YOU.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
HE'S GONE NOW.
HE HAD HER FROM BEHIND.
HE WAS DRAGGING HER TOWARD THE STREET.
THERE YOU GO.
TAKE MY ARM.
[WOMAN GRUNTING]
LOOKS LIKE SHE'S ALL RIGHT.
COME ON, COME ON.
HEY, THEY CAN SEE YOU.
HE WAS TRYING TO KILL HER.
TO REALIZE IT WAS REALLY HAPPENING.
DID YOU SEE HIM?
YES.
HIS FACE WAS SO WHITE.
OH.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
I'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
I'LL WALK YOU TO YOUR CAR.
20, 24...
WITH UNBELIEVABLE WHITE SKIN
AND RED HAIR COMBED BACK LIKE A DUCK.
A DUCK TAIL.
YES.
THAT COULD'VE BEEN ME DOWN THERE.
YOU MAY HAVE SAVED MY LIFE.
THE PLEASURE WAS MINE.
IN FACT, LET ME GO FURTHER.
IF I CAN BE OF SERVICE AGAIN...
OH, DON'T.
I CAN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT THAT NOW.
I'M SCARED AND LATER THAN I SHOULD BE,
AND THAT COULD BE TROUBLE FOR US BOTH.
ANY REGRETS?
[ENGINE STARTS]
NOT ONE.
IN SPITE OF WHAT HAPPENED,
MAYBE BECAUSE OF IT,
IT'S THE MOST EXCITING NIGHT
I CAN REMEMBER.
YOU?
REGRETS?
ARE YOU KIDDING?
ALL RIGHT!
HA HA HA HA!
ROUGH NIGHT LAST NIGHT?
YOU'RE LATE.
THOUGHT MAYBE YOU SLEPT IN.
HE'S BEEN ASKING FOR YOU.
COLLIN?
GOOD LUCK.
I WANT THE CONCRETE ON THE SITE.
IF I GET THERE AND FIND MY BOYS
SITTING AROUND PULLING THEIR PUDS...
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU LAST NIGHT?
WELL, SEE TO IT THAT YOU DO.
EVERY LAST YARD OF IT.
PARTY.
WHERE DID YOU DISAPPEAR TO?
OH, NOWHERE.
I WENT HOME.
AND THE NEXT THING I KNEW YOU WERE GONE.
WHAT'S THAT?
IT'S A BEAUTY, ISN'T IT?
BELONGED TO BUGSY SEGAL.
40 YEARS OLD, NEVER BEEN REGISTERED.
WHERE DID YOU GET IT?
A FRIEND.
GOT IT FROM A FRIEND.
HOLD IT.
[IMITATES GUN CLICKING]
FEELS GOOD, DOESN'T IT?
THE WAY IT FITS IN YOUR HAND.
ALMOST MAKES YOU WISH YOU HAD A REASON TO FIRE IT.
EXCUSE ME.
YOUR PAPER.
AHEM.
THANK YOU.
Hi, TERRY.
Hi, LILLA.
WELL, THE MARKET'S LOOKING UP.
HOW ARE THINGS COMING ON THE WOOTON PROJECT?
HELLO?
IN FACT, I'D BETTER GET BACK TO IT RIGHT NOW.
MAY I?
BE MY GUEST.
WHAT'S SO INTERESTING?
LOOKS LIKE THE MIDEAST IS HEATING UP AGAIN.
WELL, YOU SEE, THAT'S WHY I NEVER READ THE NEWS.
RIGHT.
[IMITATES GUNSHOT]
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT...
THE GIRL IN THE NEWS?
A FEW BLOCKS AWAY,
LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR LATER.
I THINK THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
NOT THE SAME GIRL, THOUGH.
MM-MMM.
YOU SAID THE ONE YOU SAW HAD BROWN HAIR.
MMM.
GOD, IT'S SCARY.
DID THE PAPER SAY ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT WITNESSES?
SAID THERE WEREN'T ANY.
MMM.
TERRY, IF IT WAS THE SAME MAN
AND NO ONE ELSE SAW HIM,
I SHOULD GO FORWARD,
GIVE THE POLICE A DESCRIPTION.
MM-HMM.
YOU COULD ASK THEM
TO KEEP YOUR IDENTITY A SECRET.
WHAT IF THEY WOULDN'T?
IT WILL ALL COME OUT.
WHAT ABOUT A LETTER?
NO, THEY WOULDN'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO IT.
THEY WOULD THINK IT WAS FROM SOME CRANK.
OH, JESUS, TERRY, I WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING.
WHY SHOULD MY LIFE BE TURNED UPSIDE-DOWN
JUST BECAUSE I HAPPENED TO LOOK OUT OF A WINDOW?
IT'S NOT FAIR.
MM-MMM.
AM I TERRIBLE?
NO.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
POLICE DEPARTMENT, PLEASE.
AAH!
TERRY!
I'LL TELL THEM WHAT YOU SAW,
ONLY I'LL TELL THEM THAT I SAW IT.
WHY SHOULDN'T I HAVE BEEN THE ONE LOOKING OUT OF IT?
HELLO?
YES.
I WITNESSED AN ASSAULT LAST NIGHT...
Okay.
THEY'LL PROBABLY MAKE A HERO OUT OF ME.
BUT YOU'LL BE LYING.
HELLO?
AND I THOUGHT I'D BETTER CALL UP ABOUT IT.
RIGHT OUTSIDE MY APARTMENT NEAR THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT.
12 EAST MOUNT VERNON PLACE.
TERRY LAMBERT.
SURE.
THAT'S THE MOST ROMANTIC THING
I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.
YOU DID THAT FOR ME.
YOU REMEMBER WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE?
MM-HMM.
TELL ME WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE.
TALL, RED HAIR.
MM-HMM.
YES, COMBED BACK
BEHIND THE EARS LIKE THIS.
MM-HMM.
WHAT WAS HE WEARING?
UH, TAN JACKET AND BLUE JEANS,
TENNIS SHOES.
WHEN YOU SAY TENNIS SHOES,
YOU MEAN TENNIS SHOES OR RUNNING SHOES?
I MEAN TENNIS SHOES.
AND I'M GOING TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU
LIKE NOBODY EVER HAS BEFORE.
BUT I'M NOT SURE WE'LL HAVE TIME
BEFORE THEY GET HERE.
GET HERE?
TERRY!
MM-HMM.
SOME DETECTIVE.
HE SOUNDED VERY EXCITED, ACTUALLY.
OH, MY GOD.
HA HA HA.
TERRY, YOU'RE GONNA PAY FOR THIS.
NO, YOU'D BETTER NOT.
COLLIN MIGHT BE HOME.
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT
IN AN HOUR.
[CAR DOORS SHUT]
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
I'M DETECTIVE QUIRKE, AND THIS IS DETECTIVE JESSUP.
MAY WE COME IN?
YEAH, SURE.
I'M SORRY.
NICE APARTMENT.
I LIKE THESE OLD BUILDINGS.
MM-HMM.
YOU LIVE HERE ALONE?
YES.
WHY?
DETECTIVE JESSUP WILL TAKE NOTES,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.
WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT YOU WERE DOING, WHAT YOU SAW.
WELL, I'D BEEN TO A PARTY, KIND OF AN OFFICE PARTY...
OFFICE?
WENTWORTH CONSTRUCTION.
COLLIN WENTWORTH?
YOU WORK FOR HIM?
YEAH.
ANYWAY,
WE JUST CLOSED A BIG ACCOUNT,
AND WE WERE HAVING A PARTY TO CELEBRATE.
I CAME HOME EARLY AND WENT TO BED.
AROUND 10:00.
THEN LATER, AT 2:15...
I REMEMBER, 'CAUSE I LOOKED AT THE CLOCK...
I HEARD A SCREAM, NOT VERY LOUD,
BUT I COULD TELL IT CAME FROM THE PARK.
I JUMPED UP AND I WENT TO THE WINDOW.
WHICH WINDOW?
THE BEDROOM WINDOW.
MAY WE SEE IT?
MM-HMM.
WERE THE DRAPES OPEN?
YES.
AND WHAT DID YOU SEE?
RIGHT DOWN THERE.
HE HAD HER FROM BEHIND
AND WAS SORT OF DRAGGING HER TOWARD THE STREET.
UH, SHE WAS STRUGGLING.
AND THEN HE THREW HER DOWN
AND THAT'S WHEN SHE SCREAMED REAL LOUD, "HELP!
HELP ME!"
AND THEN HE RAN AWAY.
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL THE POLICE?
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS THAT IMPORTANT,
UNTIL I READ ABOUT THAT OTHER GIRL THAT WAS MURDERED.
WHAT MADE YOU THINK THERE WAS A CONNECTION?
A FEW BLOCKS AWAY, HALF HOUR LATER.
NO, MR. LAMBERT, WE THINK THERE'S A CONNECTION, TOO.
AND WE'RE VERY GLAD YOU CAME FORWARD.
CIGARETTE?
NO, DON'T SMOKE.
GOOD FOR YOU.
DO YOU MIND?
DID YOU GET A GOOD LOOK AT THE ASSAILANT?
YES.
DESCRIBE HIM, PLEASE.
YOUNG, EARLY 20s, 6-FOOT.
ANY DISTINGUISHING MARKS OR CHARACTERISTICS?
RED HAIR, RED HAIR,
COMBED BACK BEHIND THE EARS IN A DUCK TAIL.
TAN JACKET, BLUE JEANS, TENNIS SHOES.
TENNIS SHOES OR RUNNING SHOES?
TENNIS SHOES.
WHEN YOU SAY TAN JACKET,
DO YOU MEAN A SPORTS COAT OR A WINDBREAKER?
WINDBREAKER.
YOU HAVE A GOOD EYE FOR DETAIL, MR. LAMBERT.
HE PROBABLY CAME FROM BEHIND THAT TREE.
THE GIRL SAYS THE SIDEWALK WAS DESERTED,
THAT HE CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.
SHE BARELY SAW HIM AT ALL.
BY THE WAY, DO YOU KNOW HER?
THE GIRL.
SHE LIVES AROUND THE CORNER.
AHEM!
NO.
SHE'S A LUCKY ONE.
THE OTHER GIRL WAS RAPED, BEATEN TO DEATH, AND DUMPED.
YOU SAID HE WAS DRAGGING HER TOWARD THE STREET,
AND HE WAS TRYING TO GET HER TO HIS VEHICLE.
SHE'S A LUCKY ONE, ALL RIGHT.
MR. LAMBERT, YOU SAID YOU CAME BACK FROM THE PARTY,
WENT RIGHT TO BED?
THAT'S RIGHT.
WERE YOU ALONE?
YES.
DIDN'T I SAY THAT?
NOT EXACTLY.
I WAS ALONE.
THAT'S WHY HE WENT TO SLEEP, DAVE.
JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE.
AAH!
DID YOU MEAN WINDBREAKER OR SPORTS COAT?
WINDBREAKER.
WHY?
I WAS SO NERVOUS.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.
THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT TO SEE.
THAT'S WHERE SHE LIVED, THE GIRL THAT WAS KILLED.
COME ON, I'LL SHOW YOU.
THIS ONE WAS ATTACKED ON HER WAY HOME, TOO.
BUT IF IT HAPPENED SO SOON AFTER,
HOW DID HE PLAN IT?
HOW DID HE KNOW WHERE SHE LIVED?
I SUPPOSE HE CAME DRIVING DOWN THIS STREET.
YOU KNOW, HE'S...
HE'S ANGRY.
EXCUSE ME, PLEASE.
Okay.
HE'S FRUSTRATED AFTER HIS ABORTED ATTEMPT
OUTSIDE OF MY PLACE.
HE STOPS AT THAT STOP SIGN RIGHT THERE.
LOOKING OVER, HE SEES A CAR
PARKED IN THE RED IN FRONT OF THIS BUILDING.
HE SEES A GIRL LOCKED IN THE ARMS OF HER LOVER,
HAVING A LAST GOOD NIGHT KISS.
ON IMPULSE, THE KILLER BACKS UP.
HE SEES THE SIDE DOOR OF THE BUILDING,
HE PARKS, AND RETURNS ON FOOT.
HE'S GUESSED THAT THE GIRL LIVES IN THE BUILDING.
THAT SOON SHE'LL BE GOING INSIDE.
HE RUNS UP THE STEPS TO THE FRONT DOOR,
WHERE HE DOES SOMETHING TO THE LOCK
SOMETHING THAT'LL PREVENT THE KEY FROM OPENING IT.
AND HE SLIPS BACK DOWN THE STEPS TO THE SIDE DOOR
TO WATCH AND TO WAIT.
THE GIRL GETS OUT OF THE CAR,
WAVES GOOD-BYE,
GOES UP THE STEPS.
SHE TRIES TO OPEN THE DOOR, BUT SHE CAN'T.
SHE TURNS TO CALL AFTER HER LOVER,
BUT HE'S ALREADY SPEEDING AWAY.
SO SHE DECIDES TO GO AROUND TO THE SIDE DOOR.
THE POLICE TOLD YOU ALL THAT...
ABOUT THE GIRL?
MOST OF IT.
THE REST WAS IN THE PAPER.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU HELPING ME DO THE RIGHT THING,
GIVING THE POLICE THE DESCRIPTION.
LET'S HOPE IT'S OF SOME USE TO THEM.
WHEN WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN?
SOON.
VERY SOON.
THERE YOU GO.
HEY, WHAT'S IN THE BAG?
A LITTLE LUNCH TIME SHOPPING?
UH, JUST SOME WHITE WINE.
HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO SOMETHING
YOU SHOULDN'T, OLD BOY?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
COP WAS HERE TO SEE YOU.
DETECTIVE JESSUP.
HE WANTS YOU TO CALL HIM AT THAT NUMBER.
THANKS, COLLIN.
WELL, WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT?
NOTHING MUCH.
A FEW NIGHTS AGO,
I WITNESSED AN ASSAULT ON THIS GIRL.
SOUNDS INTERESTING.
NOT A RAPE, COLLIN, MORE OF A MUGGING.
NO BIG DEAL.
WHICH NIGHT?
WHICH NIGHT?
YEAH, WHICH NIGHT WAS IT?
THURSDAY NIGHT.
THAT WAS THE NIGHT OF THE PARTY.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
WELL?
AREN'T YOU GOING TO CALL 'EM?
YES,
I'M GOING TO CALL 'EM.
[LIFTS RECEIVER AND DIALS TELEPHONE]
IT'S TERRY LAMBERT, DETECTIVE JESSUP.
[RUSTLES]
CERTAINLY. 7:00?
THAT WILL BE FINE.
PROBABLY GO OVER MY STATEMENT AGAIN.
YOU KNOW THE POLICE.
FRANKLY, I'M SURPRISED TO SEE YOU GET SO INVOLVED.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD SUCH A STRONG SENSE OF CIVIC DUTY.
HEY!
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU APPRECIATED FRENCH WINE, EITHER.
I'M DEVELOPING A TASTE FOR IT.
JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT.
YEAH, Okay.
JUST A SEC.
YES?
I'M HERE TO SEE DETECTIVE JESSUP.
THEY'RE RUNNING LATE.
IF YOU HAVE A SEAT,
THEY'LL HAVE IT SET UP
IN A FEW MINUTES.
YEAH.
BURGLARY.
UH-HUH.
NO.
OF COURSE.
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
YES, THANKS.
ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON.
LATE SETTING WHAT UP?
YOU SAID THEY WERE RUNNING LATE SETTING SOMETHING UP.
YOU'RE HERE FOR THE LINE-UP, AREN'T YOU?
THE LINE-UP?
YES.
NO, I THINK I WAS SUPPOSED TO JUST COME DOWN...
YOU MUST BE THE ONE.
I MEAN, THEY TOLD ME THERE WAS A WITNESS.
YES.
SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.
OH, Hi.
OF COURSE, YOU TWO MUST HAVE
BUT I'LL HAVE TO ASK YOU TO REFRAIN FROM DOING SO
DURING THE PROCEEDINGS.
RIGHT THIS WAY.
NOW THERE ARE 6 MEN I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT.
DON'T WORRY.
THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE YOU.
I DON'T WANT TO DISAPPOINT YOU,
BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE SEE MORE THAN THEY REALIZE.
BUT MR. LAMBERT HERE,
HE GOT A GOOD LOOK AT THE MAN.
YOU DID?
WELL, I, UH...
Jessup:
STEP RIGHT UP, GENTLEMEN.
DON'T BE SHY.
THAT'S RIGHT.
ALL THE WAY TO THE END.
TAKE YOUR TIME.
LOOK AT EACH ONE...
VERY CAREFULLY.
FACE LEFT, GENTLEMEN, PLEASE.
BUT YOU DID GET A GOOD LOOK AT HIM THAT NIGHT.
GOOD ENOUGH TO GIVE US
THAT DETAILED DESCRIPTION.
BUT SEEING THEM ALL TOGETHER LIKE THIS,
I JUST CAN'T BE SURE.
BUT SURELY IF YOU WERE TO COME
FACE-TO-FACE WITH THE MAN
YOU DESCRIBED IN SUCH DETAIL,
YOU'D RECOGNIZE HIM, WOULDN'T YOU?
YES, I THINK SO.
THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES.
YOUR HUNCH WAS WRONG.
ONE OF THE MEN YOU SAW TONIGHT
HAS DONE THIS KIND OF THING BEFORE.
THAT, COMBINED WITH YOUR DESCRIPTION...
WELL, OBVIOUSLY I WAS WRONG.
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING.
SORRY.
I'M SORRY YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HIM.
YEAH, ME, TOO.
I'VE SEEN YOU BEFORE...
AT EDGAR'S.
I DON'T THINK...
I COCKTAIL THERE.
IT'S NOT MY NIGHT FOR RECOGNIZING PEOPLE.
I WAS WALKING HOME FROM WORK THE NIGHT IT HAPPENED.
I DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE.
THERE'S A LOT I DON'T DO.
CAN'T DO TILL I KNOW WHO HE IS.
THEY SEEM PRETTY SURE THAT THE SAME GUY
ATTACKED THAT OTHER GIRL.
ONLY SHE'S DEAD, AND I'M ALIVE.
I SHOULD FEEL LUCKY, I GUESS.
DO YOU THINK THEY'LL CATCH HIM?
I HOPE SO.
[ENGINE STARTS]
WELL, GOOD NIGHT.
[ENGINE STARTS]
[ENGINE STARTS]
[THUNDER]
HE'S NOT EVEN TELLING HER ABOUT IT.
[RAILROAD CROSSING SIGNAL]
[APPROACHING TRAIN WHISTLE]
[HORN BLOWING]
YOU'LL SEE WHEN HE TAKES HIS HOOD OFF.
WHAT IF IT IS HIM?
WHAT DO WE DO?
FIRST, YOU'LL HAVE TO TELL ME WHETHER IT IS.
TERRY, THERE MUST BE HUNDREDS OF YOUNG MEN
IN BALTIMORE WITH RED HAIR.
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU THINK...
THERE!
LOOK.
Man:
YOU CAN'T WELD IT DOWN HERE.
I WANT YOU TO HAVE A BETTER LOOK.
THAT'S HIM, ISN'T IT?
COME ON, SYLVIA.
HE'S JUST WHAT YOU SAID,
THE HAIR, THE SIZE, EVERYTHING.
EVEN THE WHITE SKIN.
I CAN'T SAY.
NOT FOR SURE.
WHY NOT?
I JUST CAN'T.
BUT IT MIGHT BE HIM.
IT MIGHT BE.
BUT WHAT GOOD DOES THAT DO?
WHAT GOOD DOES ANY OF IT DO?
I COULDN'T GO FORWARD BEFORE.
IT WOULD BE WORSE NOW.
IF HE DID WHAT HE DID TO THOSE GIRLS
BUT WE DON'T KNOW IT, TERRY.
I AM NOT SURE.
THAT DETECTIVE QUIRKE...
HE SAID THAT ONE OF THE MEN IN THE LINE-UP
WAS THERE BECAUSE HE HAD RAPED BEFORE.
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW THIS IS THE ONE
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT.
I'M SORRY, TERRY.
I KNOW YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED,
BUT THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

WHY DIDN'T YOU IDENTIFY HENDERSON AT THE LINE-UP?
HENDERSON?
THAT'S HIM...
CHRIS HENDERSON.
I DIDN'T WANNA MAKE A MISTAKE.
AT NIGHT, TO SEE HIM UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES.

AT NIGHT YOU BECAME POSITIVE
HE ATTACKED MISS CONNELLY?
YES.
YOU STILL DIDN'T IDENTIFY HIM.
YOU WAITED... 2 DAYS.
WHY?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
HAVE WE ENOUGH FOR A SEARCH WARRANT?
WITH LAMBERT'S POSITIVE I.D., HENDERSON'S RECORD.
CAN I TIE HENDERSON TO THE DEAD GIRLS?
SHE WAS IN A BAR LAST NIGHT.
I'LL SEE IF ANYONE THERE RECOGNIZES HIS PICTURE.
I CAN PROBABLY GET THE WARRANT WITHOUT IT,
THANKS, MR. LAMBERT.
YOU'VE BEEN A BIG HELP.
I ONLY WISH I HAD HELPED SOONER.
EVEN IF YOU'D IDENTIFIED HENDERSON EARLIER,
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ARRESTED HIM.
HE'D OF STILL BEEN OUT ON THE STREET LAST NIGHT.
OUR CONCERN ISN'T THE ASSAULT ITSELF...
EXCEPT AS IT HELPS TO BUILD A MURDER CASE.
AND THANKS TO YOU, IT'S HELPING.
MAYBE WE'LL TIE HENDERSON TO THE DEAD GIRLS.
IF WE DO, WE'RE OFF AND RUNNING.
DON'T TORTURE YOURSELF ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN.
WHAT YOU DID WAS RIGHT, THERE'S NO DOUBT.
I JUST WISH YOU HADN'T HAD TO DO IT.
HE COULD COME BACK AND HURT US.
MY STATEMENT'S ONLY A TOOL FOR THEIR SEARCH WARRANT.
BEYOND THAT, THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ME
YOU DIDN'T TELL THEM YOU FOLLOWED HIM TO THE BAR?
EITHER I RECOGNIZED HIM AT NIGHT OR I DIDN'T.
I HAD NO REASON TO FOLLOW HIM.
SUPPOSE THEY DISCOVER YOU LIED?
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ME.
I PROMISE I WON'T LET THEM FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.
[TELEPHONE RINGS]
[RING]
HELLO?
OH, HOW ARE YOU, DETECTIVE QUIRKE?
I SEE.
THANKS FOR LETTING ME KNOW.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
WHAT?
WHAT DID HE WANT?
THEY GOT THE SEARCH WARRANT.
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU WANTED?
I GUESS SO, BUT...
NOBODY AT THE BAR REMEMBERED HENDERSON.
BUT THEY'VE GOT THE WARRANT ANYWAY?
YEAH.
MY STATEMENT WAS ENOUGH.
THAT'LL BE THE END OF IT.
TO CONNECT HIM TO THE MURDERS OR THEY WON'T.
THEY'RE DONE WITH ME.
THE SEARCH WAS SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTING.
NO FINGERPRINTS, NO BLOOD SAMPLES, NO CLOTHING.
NOTHING TO PROVE HENDERSON EVER CAME IN CONTACT
SOME COTTON FIBERS MATCH THE SWEATER OF ONE GIRL,
BUT IT'S COMMON FIBER.
WE FOUND SOME PEPPERMINT-FLAVORED TOOTHPICKS
IN THE TRUCK'S GLOVE COMPARTMENT.
EACH GIRL WAS PREVENTED FROM ENTERING HER RESIDENCE
BY A TOOTHPICK JAMMED INTO THE KEYHOLE
AND THEN BROKEN OFF
THE NEWSPAPERS MENTIONED JAMMED LOCKS.
WE HELD BACK ABOUT THE TOOTHPICKS.
SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW?
I'LL LET PETERS EXPLAIN.
JESUS, THAT HOLDEN'S A BREAKING JUDGE.
HAVE YOU FILLED HIM IN?
I WAS JUST STARTING TO.
WE GOT A MURDER CASE WE CAN'T WIN,
SOME INSIGNIFICANT COTTON FIBERS,
SOME TOOTHPICKS ANYONE COULD POSSESS.
MY ASSISTANT LEARNED THAT BRAND
IS GIVEN AWAY IN LOTS OF BALTIMORE RESTAURANTS.
SO HE DIDN'T DO IT?
HE COULD HAVE RAPED THE GIRLS,
HAMMERED THEM TO DEATH WITH HIS FIST.
HE COULD HAVE THROWN AWAY THE GLOVES HE WORE,
ANY ARTICLES OF CLOTHING WITH BLOOD ON THEM.
A CAR WASH WOULD HAVE CLEANED HIS TRUCK.
WHEW!
WHAT I'M SAYING IS
WE CAN'T PROVE THAT HE DID IT.
SO DETECTIVE QUIRKE AND I HAVE AGREED
TO GO WITH THE ASSAULT CASE.
WE PROSECUTE HENDERSON ON THE ASSAULT CASE.
WE CAN WIN THAT.
IT'S OPEN AND SHUT.
WE GOT A WITNESS WHO SAW HIM DO IT...
YOU.
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE ASSAULT.
I DON'T IF THERE'S A CHANCE FOR MURDER,
BUT WE'RE UP AGAINST IT.
WE AREN'T GIVING UP ON THE MURDER CASES.
WE MIGHT GET LUCKY WHEN HE'S IN PRISON.
YOU MEAN SOMEONE MAY KILL HIM?
I DOUBT THAT LUCKY.
I MEANT HENDERSON MIGHT SHOOT OFF HIS MOUTH
TO SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO MAKE A DEAL.
MEANWHILE, HE DOESN'T HURT ANYONE.
HOW ABOUT BEING A STAR WITNESS?
I...
THIS ISN'T WHAT I THOUGHT WOULD HAPPEN.
DON'T WORRY.
IT'LL BE A BREEZE.
ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS TELL THE TRUTH.
YOU SAID THAT WOULD NOT HAPPEN.
YOU'LL HAVE TO TESTIFY UNDER OATH.
HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL?
WHY DID I HAVE TO LOOK OUT THAT WINDOW?
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO CALL THE POLICE?
IF HE'S NOT PUT AWAY, HE COULD KILL AGAIN.
ALL HE'S BEING TRIED FOR IS ASSAULT.
WHAT A MESS.
IT'S NOT YOUR MESS.
IT'S MINE.
I'LL PROTECT YOU FROM IT.
SO FAR, ALL YOU'VE DONE IS GRANDSTAND.
FIRST FOR ME, AND NOW FOR THEM.
YOU BELIEVE THAT?
YOU WANTED TO BE THE HERO.
SEE WHERE IT'S GOTTEN US?
I AM THE ONE WITH EVERYTHING TO LOSE!
SYLVIA.
HEY.
I THOUGHT IT WAS YOU.
HOW LONG...
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?
I'LL WALK A WHILE IF YOU LIKE.
OH, I'M...
I'M GOING.
I WAS HAPPY TO HEAR THEY'RE GOING TO PROSECUTE
WHAT HAPPENED?
YOU THOUGHT ABOUT IT LATER AND WERE SURE?
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
I'M BETTER.
I'M DOING THINGS LIKE THIS NOW.
I USED TO RUN AT NIGHT.
MOSTLY I'M JUST WAITING TO TESTIFY.
IT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT.
I'M NERVOUS.
ARE YOU?
YOUR TESTIMONY IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN MINE.
EVEN IF I HAVE TO GET UP ON THE STAND, I WANT TO GET HIM.
YOU MUST FEEL THE SAME WAY.
YEAH.
I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO ME
TO SEE SOMEONE WHO'S NOT AFRAID TO COME FORWARD.
I'M NOT DOING SO MUCH.
YOU'RE TELLING THE TRUTH.
THAT'S MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE WOULD DO.
SEE YOU IN COURT.
OH, TERRY, I'M SO ASHAMED.
DO YOU HATE ME?
OF COURSE I WANT TO STAND BY YOU.
I'M JUST SCARED.
SO AM I.
YOU FORGIVE ME?
DO YOU?
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS.
I WANT TO.
I DIDN'T.
AND I WANT TO COME TO THE TRIAL.
WHEN YOU TESTIFY,
YOU'LL BE TESTIFYING FOR BOTH OF US.
YOU'LL BE SAYING THE WORDS,
BUT THEY'LL BE MY WORDS.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE WITH YOU.
THIS WAY.
STATE YOUR NAME FOR THE COURT, PLEASE.
YOU SWEAR THE EVIDENCE YOU'RE ABOUT TO GIVE
IS THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH,
AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH?
YES.
PLEASE TAKE THE STAND.
THIS WON'T TAKE LONG.
WHAT WERE YOU DOING ON APRIL 21st AT 2:15 A.M.?
LOOKING OUT MY BEDROOM WINDOW.
YOUR BEDROOM OVERLOOKS THE PARK?
YES.
A MAN FIGHTING WITH A WOMAN.
PHYSICALLY FIGHTING?
WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS EXACTLY AS YOU ARE ABLE
HE HAD HOLD OF HER FROM BEHIND, TRYING TO DRAG HER...
OBJECTION.
CONCLUSION.
SUSTAINED.
WAS HE DRAGGING HER?
YES, TOWARD THE STREET.
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?
HE THREW HER DOWN ON HER FACE,
GRABBED HOLD OF HER NECK,
AND STARTED TO STRANGLE HER.
WHAT DID YOU DO?
I WENT TO YELL OUT MY WINDOW.
SHE SCREAMED, AND HE RAN AWAY.
I'D LIKE YOU TO LOOK AROUND THIS COURTROOM.
DO YOU SEE THE MAN YOU SAW ATTACK THAT GIRL?
YES.
PLEASE POINT HIM OUT.
LET THE RECORD SHOW THE WITNESS IS POINTING AT THE DEFENDANT.
YOU ARE SURE THE DEFENDANT IS THE MAN YOU SAW?
YES, I AM.
THANK YOU, MR. LAMBERT.
ONE MOMENT, MR. LAMBERT.
THERE ARE TWO LAWYERS IN THIS CASE.
YES, I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE YOU THROUGH THIS ONE MORE TIME.
PERHAPS IN A LITTLE MORE DETAIL.
YOU WERE IN YOUR APARTMENT ON EAST MOUNT VERNON PLACE.
YOU LOOKED OUT YOUR WINDOW
AND YOU SAW A MAN FIGHTING WITH A WOMAN.
YES.
WHAT TIME WAS THAT?
WHAT WERE YOU DOING JUST PRIOR TO LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW?
JUST PRIOR?
WERE YOU WATCHING TELEVISION?
READING?
CHATTING WITH FRIENDS?
SLEEPING.
IN YOUR BED?
YES.
NOT IN A CHAIR?
NO, I WAS IN MY BED.
WHEN DID YOU GO TO BED?
AROUND 11:00.
YOU HAD BEEN TO A PARTY THAT NIGHT, CORRECT?
YES.
DID YOU HAVE MUCH TO DRINK?
NO.
I LEFT EARLY.
I HAD BEEN WORKING HARD AND WAS TIRED.
SO YOU WENT HOME TO GET SOME SLEEP.
YOU'RE SOUND ASLEEP AT 2:00 A.M.
WHAT WOKE YOU UP?
I HEARD A SCREAM.
THERE WERE TWO MUFFLED SCREAMS.
WHAT DID YOU DO?
I WENT TO THE WINDOW.
DID YOU TURN ON A LIGHT?
DID YOU STOP TO GET SOME MILK?
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU SAW THIS MAN AND WOMAN FIGHTING.
I WENT TO OPEN THE WINDOW, BUT IT STUCK.
THE WOMAN SCREAMED,
DID HE RUN AWAY AS SOON AS SHE SCREAMED?
SHE SCREAMED TWICE, "HELP!
HELP ME!"
AND THE MAN RAN AWAY, I THINK.
WELL, IT ALL HAPPENED PRETTY QUICKLY.
HOW QUICKLY?
WHAT?
YOU SAW THESE PEOPLE FIGHTING.
THE WOMAN SCREAMED, THE MAN RAN AWAY.
IT HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY.
HOW QUICKLY?
FIVE SECONDS?
UH...
IT MUST HAVE BEEN LONGER THAN THAT.
FOR ALL THAT TO HAPPEN.
YEAH.
WHY DON'T WE JUST SAY THAT YOU SAW THIS MAN
FOR A BRIEF TIME PERIOD,
DURING MOST OF WHICH HE WAS MOVING QUICKLY.
WOULD THAT BE AN ACCURATE STATEMENT?
HOW FAR IS IT FROM YOUR WINDOW
TO THE FOUNTAIN STEPS?
15 YARDS?
IT'S 22 YARDS.
IT'S 22 YARDS.
I NEVER MEASURED.
WELL, WE DID MEASURE IT.
THE NIGHT OF APRIL 21st, WAS THAT A CLEAR NIGHT?
IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR.
SO VISIBILITY WAS GOOD.
THERE ARE STREETLIGHTS ALSO.
THERE ARE THREE, SPACED ALONG THE BLOCK.
YES.
THE PARK'S WELL-LIT.
WELL-LIT?
OH, YES.
AS WELL-LIT AS THIS COURTROOM?
NO.
YOU'RE SURE?
OF COURSE.
OF COURSE YOU'RE SURE.
YOUR HONOR, WITH YOUR PERMISSION,
OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR.
WHAT KIND OF EXPERIMENT?
THIS EXPERIMENT IS RELEVANT?
YES.
IT'LL TAKE TWO MINUTES.
THE COURT CAN INDULGE DEFENSE COUNSEL
FOR TWO MINUTES.
THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.
ONE THING BEFORE WE BEGIN...
MR. LAMBERT, WOULD YOU REMOVE YOUR CONTACT LENSES?
YOUR CONTACT LENSES.
YOU'RE WEARING THEM, AREN'T YOU?
YES.
THEN KINDLY REMOVE THEM.
MR. LAMBERT WEARS HARD CONTACT LENSES.
THAT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT?
THEY'RE IRRITATING IF YOU SLEEP WITH THEM IN.
HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN THEM OUT THAT NIGHT.
ISN'T THAT TRUE?
HE JUST SAID THAT WHEN HE WAS AWAKENED BY SCREAMS,
HE HURRIED TO THE WINDOW WITHOUT MAKING ANY STOPS.
SURELY HE WON'T NOW SAY HE PUT IN CONTACT LENSES.
WILL YOU?
NO, I DIDN'T HAVE THEM IN.
SO I REPEAT MY REQUEST THAT YOU REMOVE THEM.
I THINK YOU'D BETTER REMOVE THEM.
HERE.
NO, I, UH...
I HAVE A LENS CASE.
NOW, MR. LAMBERT, THE DISTANCE BETWEEN US
FROM YOUR BEDROOM WINDOW TO THE FOUNTAIN STEPS.
TURN OUT THE LIGHTS.
OBJECTION.
IF WE ARE TO RE-CREATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES
UNDER WHICH THE WITNESS OBSERVED THE DEFENDANT,
SURELY IT SHOULD BE DONE PROPERLY, BY EXPERTS.
LET'S INDULGE DEFENSE COUNSELOR FOR TWO MINUTES.
FRANKLY, I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHERE THIS IS HEADING.
PROCEED.
THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.
MR. LAMBERT, I'M HOLDING IN MY HAND AN OBJECT.
COULD YOU KINDLY TELL THE COURT
WHAT THIS OBJECT IS?
IT'S A...
YOU'RE HOLDING, UM...
COME ON, MR. LAMBERT.
WHAT IS IT?
I CAN'T QUITE MAKE IT OUT.
COME ON, MR. LAMBERT.
WHAT IS IT?
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
HELP!
HELP ME!
SHALL I GIVE YOU A HINT, MR. LAMBERT?
IS IT A CAP?
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
IS IT A LADY'S SLIPPER?
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
IS IT A RED WIG?
WELL, LET'S TRY IT WITH THE LIGHTS ON.
HOW ABOUT NOW, MR. LAMBERT?
I CAN SEE...
I CAN SEE THAT SOMETHING'S THERE.
BUT YOU CAN'T IDENTIFY IT,
NOT EVEN WITH THE LIGHTS ON.
JUST A BOOK, MR. LAMBERT.
JUST A RED BOOK.
I SEE WHY MOTOR VEHICLES STIPULATES
THAT YOU CAN'T DRIVE WITHOUT GLASSES OR CONTACTS.
YOU'RE SHORTSIGHTED.
YES.
IN FACT, YOU'RE EXTREMELY SHORTSIGHTED.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT EXTREMELY.
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE THAT A PERSON WHO FAILED TO DISTINGUISH AN OBJECT
IN A BRIGHTLY LIT COURTROOM FROM 20 YARDS AWAY
COULD FAIRLY BE DESCRIBED AS EXTREMELY SHORTSIGHTED?
YES.
WOULDN'T YOU ALSO AGREE THAT IT WOULD BE UNLIKELY
THAT AN EXTREMELY SHORTSIGHTED PERSON
COULD POSITIVELY IDENTIFY SOMEONE GLIMPSED AT NIGHT
FROM 22 YARDS AWAY FOR ONLY A FEW SECONDS?
YOU NEVER SAID YOU'RE NEARSIGHTED!
YOU NEVER ASKED.
WITH MOTOR VEHICLE REGISTRATION!
ACCUSED ASSAILANT CHRIS HENDERSON
THE CASE AGAINST HIM DISMISSED
FOR INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE.
BALTIMORE POLICE REPORT NO NEW LEADS
IN THE SO-CALLED DUMPSTER MURDERS.
COULD I TALK TO YOU, PLEASE?
I'M YOUR NEIGHBOR.
IT'S FUNNY HOW TWO PEOPLE CAN LIVE SO CLOSE
AND...
MY NAME IS KATHY.
KATHY HOFFNER.
TERRY LAMBERT.
OH, PLEASE EXCUSE THE WAY I LOOK.
I'M SUCH A SLOB TODAY.
I HEARD YOUR FOOTSTEPS ON THE STAIRS,
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS PROBABLY YOU,
SO I JUST THREW THIS ON AND CAME OUT.
WELL, I'M JUST GETTING HOME.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER TO SAY ANYTHING,
I FEEL FUNNY ABOUT TALKING BEHIND PEOPLE'S BACKS.
TALK TO WHO?
THE POLICE.
THE POLICE.
OH, YOU MEAN BACK THEN.
I TALKED TO THEM BACK THEN, TOO.
THEY ASKED ME IF I WAS AWAKENED BY THE ATTACK.
THEY WERE HERE AGAIN TODAY.
TODAY?
THEY ASKED ME IF I SAW YOU THAT NIGHT.
SEEN ME?
FIRST I THOUGHT I HADN'T.
THEN I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD PEEKED OUT
WHEN I HEARD FOOTSTEPS COMING UP THE STAIRS.
I WAS NERVOUS AFTER WHAT HAD HAPPENED.
WHAT DID YOU SEE?
I SAW YOU COMING BACK IN.
THIS WAS LATER, AFTER THE EXCITEMENT HAD DIED DOWN.
I WENT OUT FOR SOME AIR.
DID YOU SEE ME GO OUT?
THE POLICE ASKED ME THE SAME QUESTION.
I JUST SAW YOU COMING IN.
MUST HAVE BEEN AFTER 3:00.
OH, I'M SURE IT WASN'T THAT LATE.
NO.
THANKS FOR LETTING ME KNOW ABOUT THE POLICE.
ANYTIME.
ANYTIME AT ALL.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
YOU HEARD THEY LET HIM GO.
IT'S SICKENING, ISN'T IT?
WANT A BEER?
THANKS.
I WOULD.
SO THAT'S THE FAMOUS BEDROOM WINDOW?
YEAH.
DO YOU MIND?
I KNOW, TERRY.
WHAT?
IT WASN'T YOU IN THE BEDROOM WINDOW.
SHE WAS THE WITNESS.
SHE SAW IT, NOT YOU.
WHO?
I'M SORRY THEY LET HIM GO.
BUT YOU WENT FORWARD...
SAVE IT, TERRY!
I SAW HER IN THE PARK,
AND I SAW HER IN COURT COACHING YOU.
PATHETIC.
WHAT, IS SHE MARRIED?
MUST BE, TO SOMEONE POWERFUL.
IT DOESN'T MATTER, REALLY.
WHAT MATTERS IS HE'S OUT THERE, FREE.
THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT THAT.
THEY CAN'T TRY HIM AGAIN.
NOT FOR ATTACKING ME,
BUT WITH SOME MORE INFORMATION,
THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET HIM
FOR WHAT HE DID TO THE OTHERS,
THE GIRLS THAT DIDN'T HAVE SOMEONE LIKE YOU TO PROTECT THEM.
THE QUESTION ISN'T WHAT AM I GOING TO DO,
IT'S WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
AND WHAT IS SHE GOING TO DO?
NOW IT'S MY TURN TO WATCH.
THANKS FOR THE BEER.
[CLICK]
[CLICK]
TERRY!
THE COPS HAVE BEEN HERE.
THEY JUST LEFT.
HERE?
THEY WANT ME TO CALL THEM?
THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU...
THEY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT YOU.
ABOUT ME?
HOW LONG YOU'VE BEEN HERE, WHAT YOU'RE LIKE.
THEY ALSO WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE NIGHT OF THAT PARTY WE HAD.
WHAT YOUR MOOD WAS, WHY YOU LEFT EARLY.
IT'S ALMOST AS THOUGH THEY SUSPECT YOU OF SOMETHING.
DID THEY ASK ANYTHING ELSE?
IF I'D NOTICED ANYTHING UNUSUAL ABOUT YOU
ON APRIL 26 OR 27.
WHAT?
THEY THINK YOU KEEP A DIARY OF MY MOODS?
WHY WOULD THEY ASK ABOUT THOSE DATES IN PARTICULAR?
WHO KNOWS?
ANYWAY, THANKS, COLLIN.
I'M SORRY THEY BOTHERED YOU.
THE POLICE DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, NOT YET.
THEY'VE BEEN QUESTIONING MY NEIGHBORS.
I THINK THEY'VE TAPPED MY PHONE.
[CHILD LAUGHS]
THEY'VE BEEN WATCHING ME.
SHE SAW YOU IN COURT.
SHE'S FIGURED IT OUT.
[SIGHS] I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
TERRY, YOU MADE A MISTAKE, A SIMPLE MISTAKE.
THE POLICE WOULDN'T DO THAT.
THEY WERE AT THE OFFICE THIS MORNING
QUESTIONING COLLIN.
COLLIN?
THAT'S RIGHT.
WHY WOULD THEY QUESTION COLLIN?
ABOUT ME!
SYLVIA!
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU!
DO THEY SUSPECT YOU WERE...
WITH SOMEBODY?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY SUSPECT.
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE WONDERING
IF MAYBE I DIDN'T KILL THOSE GIRLS.
THEY'RE TRYING TO PUT THE BLAME ON SOMEBODY ELSE.
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
YOU'RE BEING PARANOID.
ANYWAY, WHAT DID THEY TALK TO COLLIN ABOUT?
THEY ASKED ABOUT APRIL 26,
THAT'S THE DATE OF THE SECOND MURDER.
THEY ALSO ASKED HIM ABOUT THE NIGHT OF THE PARTY...
WHY I LEFT EARLY.
THE PARTY?
WHAT IF COLLIN STARTS THINKING ABOUT THE PARTY?
WELL, ONE WAY, THAT WOULD PARTIALLY SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU WOULDN'T NEED TO BE SO AFRAID TO GO TO THE POLICE.
GO TO THE POLICE?
I CAN'T DO THAT.
YOU KNOW THAT.
YOU'VE ALWAYS KNOWN.
BESIDES, I THINK YOU'RE EXAGGERATING THE WHOLE THING.
WHAT ABOUT THE REDHEAD, HENDERSON?
IF YOU'D TESTIFIED, HE WOULDN'T HAVE.
I NEVER SAID IT WAS HIM.
I WAS NEVER SURE.
YOU MADE UP YOUR OWN MIND ABOUT THAT.
IF IT WAS HIM, HE COULD DO IT AGAIN.
STOP IT, TERRY.
THAT'S NOT FAIR.
IT'S NOT MY FAULT THIS IS HAPPENING.
BESIDES, IT'LL WORK OUT.
THE POLICE AREN'T FOOLS.
WHAT ABOUT DENISE CONNELLY?
WHO?
THE GIRL THAT WAS ATTACKED!
SHE KNOWS ALL ABOUT US.
TELL HER WE NEED A LITTLE TIME.
I HAVE TO THINK.
SHE'LL BE REASONABLE, WON'T SHE?
MAYBE.
SHE HAS TO BE.
I DIDN'T GET US INTO THIS.
YOU KNOW THAT.
I HAVE TO GO NOW.
I DO.
I NEVER EVEN KNEW YOU WORE CONTACT LENSES.
LITTLE REVERSE ENGLISH, YOU'D HAVE DONE ALL RIGHT, AL.
THANKS, DENISE.

MR. LAMBERT?
GOOD MORNING.
WOULD YOU MIND COMING WITH ME?
DETECTIVE QUIRKE AND I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU FOR A FEW MINUTES.
SHALL I FOLLOW YOU?
THAT'S Okay.
I'LL BRING YOU BACK.
MR. LAMBERT.
SEEMS YOU HAVEN'T BEEN EXACTLY TRUTHFUL WITH US.
OH, YES.
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE CONTACTS.
THAT'S OUR FAULT.
WE SHOULD HAVE ASKED.
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT.
WE'VE LEARNED THAT YOU WENT OUT THAT NIGHT.
YOU TOLD US YOU WERE IN BED.
YES.
THAT YOU WERE AWAKENED, YOU WITNESSED THE ATTACK,
AND THEN YOU WENT RIGHT BACK TO BED.
YES, I DID GO OUT.
I...
I FORGOT.
YOU FORGOT?
YES, I... [INDISTINCT]
YEAH, I DID.
IT'S...
WHEN DID YOU GO OUT?
UH, AFTERWARD, BEFORE I WENT BACK TO SLEEP.
I WENT TO GET SOME AIR AND LOOK AROUND.
I WAS ALL KEYED UP.
IT'S...
WHEN DID YOU COME BACK?
A FEW MINUTES LATER.
THAT'S WHY I FORGOT.
LOOK, I KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN QUESTIONING
MY NEIGHBORS AND MY BOSS,
AND YOU'VE BEEN HAVING ME FOLLOWED,
BUT I...
LOOK, YOU DON'T REALLY THINK THAT I'M...
I'M NOT A SUSPECT, AM I?
SUPPOSE YOU TELL US ABOUT THE BAR.
WHAT BAR?
WHERE THE MURDERED GIRL STEPHANIE LUGIE
SPENT THE LAST HOURS OF HER LIFE,
WHERE NO ONE...
NO ONE...
CAN REMEMBER
HAVING SEEN THE REDHEAD CHRIS HENDERSON.
COCKTAIL WAITRESS REMEMBERS YOU QUITE CLEARLY.
SHE SPILLED A DRINK ON YOU.
WAS THAT SOMETHING ELSE YOU FORGOT?
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT PICTURE?
AM I...
ARE YOU ARRESTING ME?
NO.
NOT JUST YET.
WE'RE MOVING A LITTLE SLOWER THIS TIME AROUND.
I DON'T THINK I SHOULD ANSWER ANY MORE QUESTIONS
UNTIL I CONSULT AN ATTORNEY.
THAT MIGHT BE WELL-ADVISED.
[TELEPHONE RINGS]
HELLO.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU CAN'T JUST CALL HERE!
WE HAVE TO TALK.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!
I HAVE TO SEE YOU RIGHT AWAY.
NO!
I CAN'T SEE YOU.
I CAN'T SEE YOU AT ALL ANYMORE.
I'VE BEEN TO THE POLICE.
THEY'VE BEEN QUESTIONING ME.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
I CAN'T SEE YOU,
AND I CAN'T TALK TO YOU.
SYLVIA, DON'T MAKE ME...
I HAVE TO GO NOW.
DON'T HANG UP ON ME!
GOODBYE!
[DIAL TONE]
WHO WAS THAT, DEAR?
TERRY.
TERRY LAMBERT.
[ENGINE STOPS]
[SHUTS]
[DOORBELL RINGS]
TELL MRS. WENTWORTH IT'S TERRY LAMBERT.
WAS SHE EXPECTING YOU?
I'M SORRY, BUT SHE ISN'T HERE.
YOU TELL HER, OR SHALL I?
SHE'S NOT HERE.
NO ONE'S HERE.
WHERE ARE THEY?
DAMN IT!
WHERE HAVE THEY GONE?
THE BALLET.
THEY'VE GONE TO THE BALLET.
[CAR DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS]
[ENGINE STARTS]
[INDISTINCT TALKING]
[A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM PLAYING]
I don't know.
Listen, I'm going to talk with him.
What are you doing here?
You gave me no choice.
Are you crazy?
People will see us!
We've gone past where any of that matters.
You may have.
I haven't.
Our affair, the fact that you witnessed the attack...
I'VE TOLD YOU...
I WILL NEVER, NEVER
SYLVIA!
I'VE TOLD YOU THAT FROM THE START!
SHH!
DON'T TOUCH ME!
THEY SUSPECT ME OF MURDER.
I'VE BEEN FOLLOWED.
THEY MAY HAVE FOLLOWED ME HERE.
THEY MAY BE WATCHING ME RIGHT NOW.
THEN YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE BUT TO TALK TO COLLIN MYSELF.
I'M SORRY, TERRY, BUT IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.
I'VE ALREADY TOLD HIM.
I HAD A FEELING...
TOLD HIM WHAT?
THAT I WENT TO BED WITH YOU...
ONCE.
ON CONDITION I SWEAR I WAS IN BED WITH HIM THE NIGHT OF THE PARTY.
HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE DRAGGED INTO THAT MESS!
I TOLD HIM I WOULD.
HEY!
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH, THANK YOU.
I'M FINE.
I HAD TO.
I HAD NO CHOICE.
AND I TOLD HIM YOU'D BEEN AFTER ME EVER SINCE
TO CONTINUE THE AFFAIR,
TO SAY I WAS WITH YOU WHEN I WASN'T.
YOU'LL HAVE TO FIND SOME OTHER WAY TO SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS.
THERE IS NO OTHER WAY.
WITH OR WITHOUT YOU, I'M GOING TO THE POLICE.
WELL,
YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO...
AND I'LL DO WHAT I HAVE TO DO.
GOODBYE.
IT WAS HIM, WASN'T IT?
THE REDHEAD?
LET GO OF ME, PLEASE.
YOU WERE SURE, WEREN'T YOU,
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING?
YOU WERE SURE IT WAS HENDERSON.
ALL RIGHT.
I WAS SURE!
OF COURSE I WAS SURE.
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH MY EYES.
[SIGH]
THE ACT IS ALMOST OVER.
IT WOULD BE BETTER TO WAIT.
OF COURSE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
OH!
MMM MMM MMM!
AH!
AH...
AH...
SYLVIA!
[APPLAUSE]
YOU BASTARD!
GRAB HIM!
HE STABBED MY WIFE!
UNH!
GET HIM!
AAH!
OH!
OH, GOD!
AAH!
HE KILLED MY WIFE!
STOP HIM!
AAH!
CALL THE POLICE!
AAH!
AAH!
GET HIM!
GET HIM!
AAH!
AAH!
HE'S THE KILLER!
[INDISTINCT TALKING]
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE BACK HERE.
HEY!
SECURITY!
GET SECURITY!
YEAH... [INDISTINCT] THE BACK DOOR.
[INDISTINCT TALKING]
[POLICE SIREN BLARING]
TONIGHT THE BALTIMORE SOCIAL COMMUNITY IS SHOCKED
OVER THE MURDER OF ONE OF ITS OWN.
BUT POLICE REFUSE TO SPECULATE
HERE AT THE TOWNSEND THEATER IS CONNECTED
TO THE SO-CALLED DUMPSTER MURDERS.
AN EMPLOYEE OF THE DEAD WOMAN'S HUSBAND,
COLLIN WENTWORTH, WAS A WITNESS
TO AN EARLIER RELATED ASSAULT.
POLICE ARE SEEKING HIM FOR QUESTIONING.
THANK YOU, CRAIG, FOR THAT LIVE MINICAM REPORT.
HUNDREDS OF SCHOOLCHILDREN SWARMED ABOARD THE TALL SHIP...
DENISE...
OH!
OH!
OW!
DENISE!
OH, MY GOD.
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
WELL, HERE IT IS.
GOOD NIGHT.
YEAH.
THANKS, PETER.
GOOD NIGHT.
SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
I'LL TELL THEM EVERYTHING AND TRY TO GET THEM TO BELIEVE ME.
YOU'D SEEN US TOGETHER.
YOU SAW SYLVIA AT THE TRIAL.
WHY SHOULDN'T SHE BE AT THE TRIAL?
BUT DENISE, YOU KNOW SHE WAS THE REAL WITNESS.
I CAN SAY I THINK THAT.
I CAN'T PROVE IT.
THOSE PEOPLE AT THE TOWNSEND THEATER
WILL SAY THEY THINK YOU KILLED HER.
[TIRES SCREECHING]
I LED HIM STRAIGHT TO HER.
I KNEW I WAS BEING FOLLOWED, BUT NOT THAT IT WAS HENDERSON.
AND HE COULDN'T HAVE PLANNED IT BETTER.
HE GOT RID OF THE ONE PERSON THAT COULD IMPLICATE HIM
AND THE ONE PERSON THAT COULD CLEAR ME.
SO NOW IT LOOKS LIKE I WAS TRYING
TO SHIFT THE BLAME FROM THE BEGINNING.
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS.
WANT A BEER?
YEAH.
TELL ME SOMETHING.
YOU DIDN'T SUSPECT ME LIKE THE POLICE.
WHY?
I KNEW SOMETHING THE POLICE DIDN'T.
REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME WE MET?
THE LINE-UP?
HOW COULD I FORGET?
I KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG EVEN THEN.
IT WAS OBVIOUS YOU'D NEVER SEEN ME BEFORE,
FROM YOUR BEDROOM WINDOW OR ANYPLACE ELSE,
AND YOU WERE COMPLETELY INDIFFERENT TO WHAT YOU DID SEE.
NOT FLATTERING, PERHAPS, BUT UPON REFLECTION, TRUSTWORTHY.
YOU WEREN'T INTERESTED IN FUCKING ME,
AND YOU CERTAINLY WEREN'T INTERESTED IN KILLING ME.
YOU WEREN'T INTERESTED, PERIOD.
HE'LL DO IT AGAIN, YOU KNOW.
KILL SOME GIRL, OR TRY TO.
I'LL BE SAFE IN JAIL.
THE PERFECT ALIBI.
I WONDER WHAT SETS HIM OFF.
BETWEEN THE 2 OF US, WE KNOW MORE ABOUT IT THAN ANYBODY.
YOU WERE THERE THAT NIGHT AT THE BAR
WHEN HE PICKED OUT THAT SORORITY GIRL.
THE NIGHT HE ATTACKED ME, I DON'T REMEMBER HIM AT THE BAR,
BUT HE WAS PROBABLY THERE WATCHING ME.
DO WE LOOK ALIKE AT ALL, THAT OTHER GIRL AND ME?
NOT REALLY.
WHAT MADE HIM SINGLE HER OUT?
WHAT MADE HIM NOTICE HER IN PARTICULAR?
WELL, EVERYBODY NOTICED HER.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WELL, SHE DANCED.
DANCED...
TO A RECORD?
WITH HER FRIENDS CHEERING HER ON.
SHE WAS SEXY.
YOU DIDN'T DANCE FOR HIM, DID YOU?
SURE.
ON A THURSDAY NIGHT, THE PLACE IS PACKED.
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO BREATHE.
DID ANYTHING UNUSUAL HAPPEN THAT NIGHT?
IT WAS PETER'S BIRTHDAY.
PETER?
I REMEMBER, BECAUSE THE NEXT DAY, AFTER WHAT HAPPENED,
HE TOLD ME I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM THE PRESENT HE WISHED FOR...
HE WANTED ME TO GO HOME WITH HIM.
WHAT HAPPENED THAT WAS SO UNUSUAL?
AT MIDNIGHT...
WE'D GOTTEN HIM A CAKE...
AND AT MIDNIGHT, C.C. AND I BROUGHT IT OUT.
[SYNTHESIZER MUSIC PLAYING]
Okay, YOU GUYS!
THIS ONE'S FOR PETER!
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU ♪
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU ♪
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DEAR PETER ♪
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU ♪
YAY!
[WHISTLES]
PETER MADE A WISH AND BLEW OUT ALL THE CANDLES.
AND THEN I KISSED HIM.
YES, I KISSED HIM,
AND SO I KISSED HIM AGAIN, AND THEY CHEERED EVEN LOUDER.
WHOA!
[WHISTLES]
THEN HE KISSED ME.
I MEAN HE REALLY KISSED ME,
AND EVERYBODY WENT CRAZY.
BUT YOU DON'T REMEMBER HIM THERE, HENDERSON?
AT THAT OTHER BAR, EITHER, THE ONE WHERE YOU SAW HIM.
ANOTHER BEER?
YEAH.
TWO VICTIMS.
BOTH YOUNG, BOTH PRETTY.
BOTH WERE IN BARS WHERE THEY COULD BE WATCHED BY HIM,
AND BOTH DID SOMETHING THAT MADE THEM THE CENTER OF ATTENTION.
MAYBE HE GETS EXCITED, TOO, BUT HE WANTS TO KILL.
WHAT A GUY.
WHAT CAN I DO?
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES WITH THE POLICE.
DO YOU KNOW ANY LAWYERS?
YEAH, A GUY I USED TO GO TO SCHOOL WITH.
I THOUGHT I'D GIVE HIM A CALL.
IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO GO IN WITH SOMEBODY.
YOU CAN STAY HERE TONIGHT IF YOU WANT...
ON THE COUCH.
CALL HIM IN THE MORNING.
DID YOU LOVE HER?
SYLVIA?
LOVE...
I DIDN'T REALLY EVEN KNOW HER, AS WE'VE SEEN.
I WAS JUST SOMETHING FOR HER TO DO.
I CAN THINK OF WORSE THINGS TO DO.
HERE.
[DOOR OPENS]
YOU'RE AWAKE.
WHAT TIME IS IT?
ABOUT 4:30.
LISTEN...
WHY DON'T YOU COME INTO MY ROOM?
I'D LIKE YOU TO.
I FIND YOU ATTRACTIVE.
I MEAN, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
THAT IS TRUE, BUT...
THAT'S NOT THE REAL REASON.
EVER SINCE THAT NIGHT,
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO...
TO DO CERTAIN THINGS.
TONIGHT, I THINK I COULD,
I MEAN, IF YOU...
WANT TO.
COME HERE.
COME HERE.
THERE'S A BED IN THERE.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS?
NOTHING, I GUESS.
TERRY?
COME HERE.
WHAT'S WRONG?
WAIT A SECOND.
[TAPS SQUEAK]
THINGS ARE DEFINITELY LOOKING BETTER TO ME THIS MORNING.
ME, TOO.
I WAS THINKING.
ABOUT IT BEING ONLY A MATTER OF TIME WITH HENDERSON,
AND SOONER OR LATER, HE'LL KILL AGAIN?
YEAH.
AND THAT WOULD CLEAR UP YOUR PROBLEM?
IT COULD HAPPEN SOONER INSTEAD OF LATER,
WITH A LITTLE HELP.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THINK ABOUT IT.
SOME GIRL WHO COULD INADVERTENTLY PUSH HIS BUTTONS.
THAT COULD TAKE A LONG TIME.
WHAT IF SOME GIRL WHO KNEW WHAT BUTTONS TO PUSH
DELIBERATELY SET ABOUT PUSHING THEM?
A GIRL WHO WAS HIS TYPE?
FORGET IT.
WHY?
I WON'T LET YOU.
WHY?
IT'S DANGEROUS.
NOT IF YOU HELP.
WE WON'T LET IT BE.
NO.
I SAID FORGET IT.
THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE THE OFFER.
IT'S NO MORE THAN YOU DID FOR HER.
THAT I WAS EITHER A ROMANTIC FOOL OR AN IDIOT.
I WAS PROBABLY BOTH.
YOU KNOW, IF I WANT TO AHEAD, YOU COULDN'T STOP ME.
YOU'D BE IN CUSTODY, REMEMBER?
BUT I DO HAVE MY OWN REASONS FOR WANTING HIM CAUGHT.
HE ASSAULTED ME.
IF I THOUGHT YOU WERE SERIOUS...
IT WOULD NEVER WORK.
HE WOULDN'T GO FOR YOU AGAIN.
HE'D KNOW IT WAS A TRAP.
NOT IF HE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE ME.
YOU JUST DON'T THINK I'M SEXY ENOUGH
TO MAKE HIM TRY.
WHY WOULDN'T HE RECOGNIZE YOU?
BECAUSE, TERRY, I'M A WOMAN,
IN CASE YOU STILL HAVEN'T NOTICED.
HOW DO I LOOK?
UH, DETECTIVE QUIRKE, IT'S TERRY LAMBERT.
NEVER MIND THAT NOW.
YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG.
UH, I WANT TO GIVE MYSELF UP.
I DO, BUT JUST TO YOU...
AND DETECTIVE JESSUP.
WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT YOU TO DO.
NO, NOT NOW.
TONIGHT.
LOOK, ONE MORE DAY WON'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
LOOK, JUST BE AT THIS NUMBER AFTER 10:00.
I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT THEN.
JUST BE THERE.
WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR EYEBROWS?
DYED.
FAKE EYELASHES.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
YEAH.
YEAH.
[METAL GRINDING]
WHY WOULD HE HAVE TO WORK LATE TONIGHT?
WHY NOT?
WHAT IF HE DOESN'T GO OUT?
WHAT IF HE GOES HOME AFTER WORK?
THEN THAT'S IT.
I CALL QUIRKE.
LOOK.
[WELDING]
[INDISTINCT TALKING]
NOW, REMEMBER.
STAY BACK A LITTLE.
WATCH ME IN YOUR REAR-VIEW MIRROR.
I'LL BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
GO...
YOU BETTER HURRY.
GO.
WE DON'T GET SEPARATED, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.
YOU LOSE ME, STOP AND WAIT FOR ME TO CATCH UP.
BUT BY THEN, HE'D BE...
WE DON'T GET SEPARATED NO MATTER WHAT, AGREED?
AGREED!

THERE'S A PHONE BOOTH RIGHT BACK THERE.

I GO IN AND TRY TO SET THE HOOK.
IF IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S GONNA GO FOR IT...
I CALL QUIRKE, TELL HIM WHAT'S HAPPENING,
TO GET OVER TO YOUR PLACE AND MEET ME THERE.
I DRIVE HOME WITH HENDERSON FOLLOWING.
IF HE GOES FOR ME, QUIRKE'S THERE TO SEE IT.

Hello.
I wasn't sure you'd come.
I almost didn't, and then I got lost, all turned around.
Nothing looked the same.
Would you like something to drink?
Maybe that would be good.
Some white wine?
Uh.
I'm out of white wine right now.
I've had enough to drink already.
Maybe too much.
How did you get away?
My sister's having problems with her husband.
I told Collin she needed to see me.
[Scoffs] at this hour?
It's a crisis.
What did you say?
"Thanks for the party."
Collin won't miss me.
He's your husband.
I just work for him.
I don't know what to say.
I don't either.
I've never...
I know.
Why did you...
Why are you...
Because you want me to.
And have wanted me for a long time.
I was so obvious?
I couldn't ignore it.
And I guess I'm to the point where I need to be wanted like that.
Collin...
Oh, don't tell me Collin knew, too?
If Collin knew...
You know him.
What do you think Collin would do if he knew?
I don't know.
Mmm.
Mmm.
I can't move.
Thank god.

But I have to.

I'll be right back.

What is it?
What happened?
He was trying to kill her.
[Crying]
Who was?
Hey, you.
Are you all right?
He's gone now.
He had her from behind.
He was dragging her toward the street.
There you go.
Take my arm.
[Woman grunting]
Looks like she's all right.
Come on, come on.
Hey, they can see you.
He was trying to kill her.
To realize it was really happening.
Did you see him?
Yes.
His face was so white.
Oh.
okay.
Okay.
Okay.
I've got to get out of here.
I'll walk you to your car.
20, 24... with unbelievable white skin and red hair combed back like a duck.
A duck tail.
Yes.
That could've been me down there.
You may have saved my life.
The pleasure was mine.
In fact, let me go further.
If I can be of service again...
Oh, don't.
I can't even think about that now.
I'm scared and later than I should be, and that could be trouble for us both.
Any regrets?
[Engine starts]
Not one.
In spite of what happened, maybe because of it, it's the most exciting night
I can remember.
You?
Regrets?
are you kidding?
All right!
Ha ha ha ha!
Rough night last night?
You're late.
Thought maybe you slept in.
He's been asking for you.
Collin?
Good luck.
I want the concrete on the site.
If I get there and find my boys sitting around pulling their puds...
What happened to you last night?
Well, see to it that you do.
Every last yard of it.
Party.
Where did you disappear to?
Oh, nowhere.
I went home.
And the next thing I knew you were gone.
What's that?
It's a beauty, isn't it?
Belonged to bugsy segal.
40 years old, never been registered.
Where did you get it?
A friend.
Got it from a friend.
Hold it.
[Imitates gun clicking]
Feels good, doesn't it?
The way it fits in your hand.
Almost makes you wish you had a reason to fire it.
Excuse me.
Your paper.
Ahem.
Thank you.
Hi, Terry.
Hi, lilla.
Well, the market's looking up.
How are things coming on the wooton project?
Hello?
In fact, I'd better get back to it right now.
May I?
Be my guest.
What's so interesting?
Looks like the mideast is heating up again.
Well, you see, that's why I never read the news.
Right.
[Imitates gunshot]
What do you think about it...
The girl in the news?
A few blocks away, less than half an hour later.
I think there's a good chance not the same girl, though.
Mm-mmm.
You said the one you saw had brown hair.
Mmm.
God, it's scary.
Did the paper say anything else about witnesses?
Said there weren't any.
Mmm.
Terry, if it was the same man and no one else saw him,
I should go forward, give the police a description.
Mm-hmm.
you could ask them to keep your identity a secret.
What if they wouldn't?
It will all come out.
What about a letter?
No, they wouldn't pay much attention to it.
They would think it was from some crank.
Oh, Jesus, Terry, I want to do the right thing.
Why should my life be turned upside-down just because I happened to look out of a window?
It's not fair.
Mm-mmm.
Am I terrible?
No.
What are you doing?
Police department, please.
Aah!
Terry!
I'll tell them what you saw, only I'll tell them that I saw it.
Why shouldn't I have been the one looking out of it?
Hello?
Yes.
I witnessed an assault last night... okay.
They'll probably make a hero out of me.
But you'll be lying.
Hello?
And I thought I'd better call up about it.
Right outside my apartment near the Washington monument.
12 east mount Vernon place.
Terry lambert.
Sure.
That's the most romantic thing
I've ever seen in my life.
You did that for me.
You remember what he looked like?
Mm-hmm.
Tell me what he looked like.
Tall, red hair.
Mm-hmm.
Yes, combed back behind the ears like this.
Mm-hmm.
What was he wearing?
Uh, tan jacket and blue jeans, tennis shoes.
When you say tennis shoes, you mean tennis shoes or running shoes?
I mean tennis shoes.
And I'm going to make love to you like nobody ever has before.
But I'm not sure we'll have time before they get here.
Get here?
Terry!
Mm-hmm.
Some detective.
He sounded very excited, actually.
Oh, my god.
Ha ha ha.
Terry, you're gonna pay for this.
No, you'd better not.
Collin might be home.
On the other side of the Washington monument in an hour.
[Car doors shut]
[Knock on door]
I'm detective quirke, and this is detective Jessup.
May we come in?
Yeah, sure.
I'm sorry.
Nice apartment.
I like these old buildings.
Mm-hmm.
You live here alone?
Yes.
Why?
Detective Jessup will take notes, if you don't mind.
What happened, what you were doing, what you saw.
Well, I'd been to a party, kind of an office party...
Office?
Wentworth construction.
Collin wentworth?
You work for him?
Yeah.
Anyway, we just closed a big account, and we were having a party to celebrate.
I came home early and went to bed.
Around 10:00.
Then later, at 2:15...
I remember, 'cause I looked at the clock...
I heard a scream, not very loud, but I could tell it came from the park.
I jumped up and I went to the window.
Which window?
The bedroom window.
May we see it?
Mm-hmm.
Were the drapes open?
Yes.
And what did you see?
Right down there.
He had her from behind and was sort of dragging her toward the street.
Uh, she was struggling.
And then he threw her down and that's when she screamed real loud, "help!
Help me!"
And then he ran away.
Why didn't you call the police?
I didn't think it was that important, until I read about that other girl that was murdered.
What made you think there was a connection?
A few blocks away, half hour later.
No, Mr. lambert, we think there's a connection, too.
And we're very glad you came forward.
Cigarette?
no, don't smoke.
Good for you.
Do you mind?
Did you get a good look at the assailant?
Yes.
Describe him, please.
Young, early 20s, 6-foot.
Any distinguishing marks or characteristics?
Red hair, red hair, combed back behind the ears in a duck tail.
Tan jacket, blue jeans, tennis shoes.
Tennis shoes or running shoes?
Tennis shoes.
When you say tan jacket, do you mean a sports coat or a windbreaker?
Windbreaker.
You have a good eye for detail, Mr. lambert.
He probably came from behind that tree.
The girl says the sidewalk was deserted, that he came out of nowhere.
She barely saw him at all.
By the way, do you know her?
The girl.
She lives around the corner.
Ahem!
No.
She's a lucky one.
The other girl was raped, beaten to death, and dumped.
You said he was dragging her toward the street, and he was trying to get her to his vehicle.
She's a lucky one, all right.
Mr. lambert, you said you came back from the party, went right to bed?
That's right.
Were you alone?
Yes.
Didn't I say that?
Not exactly.
I was alone.
That's why he went to sleep, Dave.
Just wanted to make sure.
Aah!
Did you mean windbreaker or sports coat?
Windbreaker.
Why?
I was so nervous.
I didn't know what to do.
Tell me what happened.
There's something I want to see.
That's where she lived, the girl that was killed.
Come on, I'll show you.
This one was attacked on her way home, too.
But if it happened so soon after, how did he plan it?
How did he know where she lived?
I suppose he came driving down this street.
You know, he's...
He's angry.
Excuse me, please.
Okay.
He's frustrated after his aborted attempt outside of my place.
He stops at that stop sign right there.
Looking over, he sees a car parked in the red in front of this building.
He sees a girl locked in the arms of her lover, having a last good night kiss.
On impulse, the killer backs up.
He sees the side door of the building, he parks, and returns on foot.
He's guessed that the girl lives in the building.
That soon she'll be going inside.
He runs up the steps to the front door, where he does something to the lock something that'll prevent the key from opening it.
And he slips back down the steps to the side door to watch and to wait.
The girl gets out of the car, waves good-bye, goes up the steps.
She tries to open the door, but she can't.
She turns to call after her lover, but he's already speeding away.
So she decides to go around to the side door.
The police told you all that...
About the girl?
Most of it.
The rest was in the paper.
I want you to know I really appreciate you helping me do the right thing, giving the police the description.
Let's hope it's of some use to them.
When will I see you again?
Soon.
Very soon.
There you go.
Hey, what's in the bag?
A little lunch time shopping?
Uh, just some white wine.
Have you been up to something you shouldn't, old boy?
What do you mean?
Cop was here to see you.
Detective Jessup.
He wants you to call him at that number.
Thanks, Collin.
Well, what's it all about?
Nothing much.
A few nights ago,
I witnessed an assault on this girl.
Sounds interesting.
Not a rape, Collin, more of a mugging.
No big deal.
Which night?
Which night?
Yeah, which night was it?
Thursday night.
That was the night of the party.
Yeah, that's right.
Well?
Aren't you going to call 'em?
Yes,
I'm going to call 'em.

It's Terry lambert, detective Jessup.
[Rustles]
Certainly. 7:00?
That will be fine.
Probably go over my statement again.
You know the police.
Frankly, I'm surprised to see you get so involved.
I didn't know you had such a strong sense of civic duty.
Hey!
I didn't know you appreciated French wine, either.
I'm developing a taste for it.
Just tell me what you want.
Yeah, okay.
Just a sec.
Yes?
I'm here to see detective Jessup.
They're running late.
If you have a seat, they'll have it set up in a few minutes.
Yeah.
Burglary.
Uh-huh.
No.
Of course.
[Indistinct chatter]
Yes, thanks.
All right, hold on.
Late setting what up?
You said they were running late setting something up.
You're here for the line-up, aren't you?
The line-up?
Yes.
No, I think I was supposed to just come down...
You must be the one.
I mean, they told me there was a witness.
Yes.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Oh, hi.
Of course, you two must have but I'll have to ask you to refrain from doing so during the proceedings.
Right this way.
Now there are 6 men I want you to look at.
Don't worry.
They won't be able to see you.
I don't want to disappoint you, because sometimes people see more than they realize.
But Mr. lambert here, he got a good look at the man.
You did?
Well, I, uh...
Jessup:
Step right up, gentlemen.
Don't be shy.
That's right.
All the way to the end.
Take your time.
Look at each one...
Very carefully.
Face left, gentlemen, please.
But you did get a good look at him that night.
Good enough to give us that detailed description.
But seeing them all together like this,
I just can't be sure.
But surely if you were to come face-to-face with the man you described in such detail, you'd recognize him, wouldn't you?
Yes, I think so.
That's the way it goes.
Your hunch was wrong.
One of the men you saw tonight has done this kind of thing before.
That, combined with your description...
Well, obviously I was wrong.
We'll just have to keep looking.
Sorry.
I'm sorry you didn't recognize him.
Yeah, me, too.
I've seen you before...
At Edgar's.
I don't think...
I cocktail there.
It's not my night for recognizing people.
I was walking home from work the night it happened.
I don't do that anymore.
There's a lot I don't do.
Can't do till I know who he is.
They seem pretty sure that the same guy attacked that other girl.
Only she's dead, and I'm alive.
I should feel lucky, I guess.
Do you think they'll catch him?
I hope so.
[Engine starts]
Well, good night.
[Engine starts]
[Engine starts]
[Thunder]
He's not even telling her about it.
[Railroad crossing signal]
[Approaching train whistle]
[Horn blowing]
You'll see when he takes his hood off.
What if it is him?
What do we do?
First, you'll have to tell me whether it is.
Terry, there must be hundreds of young men in Baltimore with red hair.
I don't know why you think...
There!
Look.
Man:
You can't weld it down here.
I want you to have a better look.
That's him, isn't it?
Come on, Sylvia.
He's just what you said, the hair, the size, everything.
Even the white skin.
I can't say.
Not for sure.
Why not?
I just can't.
But it might be him.
It might be.
But what good does that do?
What good does any of it do?
I couldn't go forward before.
It would be worse now.
If he did what he did to those girls but we don't know it, Terry.
I am not sure.
That detective quirke...
He said that one of the men in the line-up was there because he had raped before.
But you don't know this is the one he was talking about.
I'm sorry, Terry.
I know you're disappointed, but there's nothing I can do about it.
I'll tell you what.
Let's not spend our time driving around, okay?
Okay.
[Engine starts]
[Indistinct chatter]
[Pop music playing]
[New song begins]
Can I get you something from the bar?
Uh, yeah.
A beer.
Draft?
Yeah.
[Indistinct]
[Indistinct chatter]
Hey.
Oh.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Whoa!
[Whistles]
[Whistling]
Yeah!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Good lord, have mercy.

Man:
Yeah!
No keep going!
Go around!

[New song begins]
[Indistinct chatter]
And me, making a fool of myself.
[Indistinct chatter]
Here, watch this.
Ready for another?
No, thanks.
Oh!
Oh, my god!
Oh!
That's all right.
No, really.
Let me buy you a drink.
It's the least I can do.
It'll make me feel better.
Okay, okay.
It'll make me feel better.
♪ Take me in your arms and make love to me ♪
Don't want to wake them.
No such luck.
Chris, is that you?
You come up here!
[Starts engine]
I'm tired of you being out till all hours of the night!
I told you to be in this house before midnight!
If this ever happens again, you're packing your things and leaving!
I mean it!
Go on down!
[Door slams]
You be quiet about it down there!
[Sirens]
That's it.
Get her out of here.
What's going on?
They found her body stuffed in there about an hour ago.
Any idea who she is?
Nah.
What do you think?
Interesting.
Here's Peters.
Is this what time don't start, huh?
I hear you got something.
Peters.
State's attorney's office.
Nice to meet you.
I understand you've told quite a story.
I'd like to ask some questions.
Why didn't you identify Henderson at the line-up?
Henderson?
That's him...
Chris Henderson.
I didn't wanna make a mistake.
At night, to see him under similar circumstances.
Unusually conscientious.
At night you became positive he attacked miss connelly?
Yes.
You still didn't identify him.
You waited... 2 days.
Why?
I don't know.
What do you think?
Have we enough for a search warrant?
With lambert's positive I.D., Henderson's record.
Can I tie Henderson to the dead girls?
She was in a bar last night.
I'll see if anyone there recognizes his picture.
I can probably get the warrant without it, thanks, Mr. lambert.
You've been a big help.
I only wish I had helped sooner.
Even if you'd identified Henderson earlier, they wouldn't have arrested him.
He'd of still been out on the street last night.
Our concern isn't the assault itself...
Except as it helps to build a murder case.
And thanks to you, it's helping.
Maybe we'll tie Henderson to the dead girls.
If we do, we're off and running.
Don't torture yourself about what might have been.
What you did was right, there's no doubt.
I just wish you hadn't had to do it.
He could come back and hurt us.
My statement's only a tool for their search warrant.
Beyond that, they don't care about me you didn't tell them you followed him to the bar?
Either I recognized him at night or I didn't.
I had no reason to follow him.
Suppose they discover you lied?
They don't care about me.
I promise I won't let them find out about you.
[Telephone rings]
[Ring]
Hello?
Oh, how are you, detective quirke?
I see.
Thanks for letting me know.
Good luck to you.
What?
What did he want?
They got the search warrant.
Isn't that what you wanted?
I guess so, but...
Nobody at the bar remembered Henderson.
But they've got the warrant anyway?
Yeah.
My statement was enough.
That'll be the end of it.
To connect him to the murders or they won't.
They're done with me.
The search was somewhat disappointing.
No fingerprints, no blood samples, no clothing.
Nothing to prove Henderson ever came in contact some cotton fibers match the sweater of one girl, but it's common fiber.
We found some peppermint-flavored toothpicks in the truck's glove compartment.
Each girl was prevented from entering her residence by a toothpick jammed into the keyhole and then broken off the newspapers mentioned jammed locks.
We held back about the toothpicks.
So what happens now?
I'll let Peters explain.
Jesus, that Holden's a breaking judge.
Have you filled him in?
I was just starting to.
We got a murder case we can't win, some insignificant cotton fibers, some toothpicks anyone could possess.
My assistant learned that brand is given away in lots of Baltimore restaurants.
So he didn't do it?
He could have raped the girls, hammered them to death with his fist.
He could have thrown away the gloves he wore, any articles of clothing with blood on them.
A car wash would have cleaned his truck.
Whew!
What I'm saying is we can't prove that he did it.
So detective quirke and I have agreed to go with the assault case.
We prosecute Henderson on the assault case.
We can win that.
It's open and shut.
We got a witness who saw him do it... you.
You said you didn't care about the assault.
I don't if there's a chance for murder, but we're up against it.
We aren't giving up on the murder cases.
We might get lucky when he's in prison.
You mean someone may kill him?
I doubt that lucky.
I meant Henderson might shoot off his mouth to somebody who wants to make a deal.
Meanwhile, he doesn't hurt anyone.
How about being a star witness?
I...
This isn't what I thought would happen.
Don't worry.
It'll be a breeze.
All you've got to do is tell the truth.
You said that would not happen.
You'll have to testify under oath.
How do you think I feel?
Why did I have to look out that window?
Why did you have to call the police?
If he's not put away, he could kill again.
All he's being tried for is assault.
What a mess.
It's not your mess.
It's mine.
I'll protect you from it.
So far, all you've done is grandstand.
First for me, and now for them.
You believe that?
You wanted to be the hero.
See where it's gotten us?
I am the one with everything to lose!
Sylvia.
Hey.
I thought it was you.
How long... what are you doing?
What does it look like?
I'll walk a while if you like.
Oh, I'm...
I'm going.
I was happy to hear they're going to prosecute what happened?
You thought about it later and were sure?
Something like that.
I'm better.
I'm doing things like this now.
I used to run at night.
Mostly I'm just waiting to testify.
It's all I think about.
I'm nervous.
Are you?
Your testimony is much more important than mine.
Even if I have to get up on the stand, I want to get him.
You must feel the same way.
Yeah.
I just want to tell you how much it means to me to see someone who's not afraid to come forward.
I'm not doing so much.
You're telling the truth.
That's more than most people would do.
See you in court.
Oh, Terry, I'm so ashamed.
Do you hate me?
Of course I want to stand by you.
I'm just scared.
So am I.
You forgive me?
Do you?
Let's go upstairs.
I want to.
I didn't.
And I want to come to the trial.
When you testify, you'll be testifying for both of us.
You'll be saying the words, but they'll be my words.
I'll be right there with you.
This way.
State your name for the court, please.
You swear the evidence you're about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
Yes.
Please take the stand.
This won't take long.
What were you doing on April 21st at 2:15 A.M.?
Looking out my bedroom window.
Your bedroom overlooks the park?
Yes.
A man fighting with a woman.
Physically fighting?
Would you describe as exactly as you are able he had hold of her from behind, trying to drag her...
Objection.
Conclusion.
Sustained.
Was he dragging her?
Yes, toward the street.
Then what happened?
He threw her down on her face, grabbed hold of her neck, and started to strangle her.
What did you do?
I went to yell out my window.
She screamed, and he ran away.
I'd like you to look around this courtroom.
Do you see the man you saw attack that girl?
Yes.
Please point him out.
Let the record show the witness is pointing at the defendant.
You are sure the defendant is the man you saw?
Yes, I am.
Thank you, Mr. lambert.
One moment, Mr. lambert.
There are two lawyers in this case.
Yes, I would like to take you through this one more time.
Perhaps in a little more detail.
You were in your apartment on east mount Vernon place.
You looked out your window and you saw a man fighting with a woman.
Yes.
What time was that?
What were you doing just prior to looking out the window?
Just prior?
Were you watching television?
Reading?
chatting with friends?
Sleeping.
In your bed?
Yes.
Not in a chair?
No, I was in my bed.
When did you go to bed?
Around 11:00.
You had been to a party that night, correct?
Yes.
Did you have much to drink?
No.
I left early.
I had been working hard and was tired.
So you went home to get some sleep.
You're sound asleep at 2:00 A.M.
What woke you up?
I heard a scream.
There were two muffled screams.
What did you do?
I went to the window.
Did you turn on a light?
Did you stop to get some milk?
And that's when you saw this man and woman fighting.
I went to open the window, but it stuck.
The woman screamed, did he run away as soon as she screamed?
She screamed twice, "help!
Help me!"
And the man ran away, I think.
Well, it all happened pretty quickly.
How quickly?
What?
You saw these people fighting.
The woman screamed, the man ran away.
It happened very quickly.
How quickly?
Five seconds?
Uh... it must have been longer than that.
For all that to happen.
Yeah.
Why don't we just say that you saw this man for a brief time period, during most of which he was moving quickly.
Would that be an accurate statement?
How far is it from your window to the fountain steps?
15 yards?
It's 22 yards.
It's 22 yards.
I never measured.
Well, we did measure it.
The night of April 21st, was that a clear night?
It was pretty clear.
So visibility was good.
There are streetlights also.
There are three, spaced along the block.
Yes.
The park's well-lit.
Well-lit?
Oh, yes.
As well-lit as this courtroom?
No.
You're sure?
Of course.
Of course you're sure.
Your honor, with your permission, objection, your honor.
What kind of experiment?
This experiment is relevant?
Yes.
It'll take two minutes.
The court can indulge defense counsel for two minutes.
Thank you, your honor.
One thing before we begin...
Mr. lambert, would you remove your contact lenses?
Your contact lenses.
You're wearing them, aren't you?
Yes.
Then kindly remove them.
Mr. lambert wears hard contact lenses.
That's true, isn't it?
They're irritating if you sleep with them in.
He would have taken them out that night.
Isn't that true?
He just said that when he was awakened by screams, he hurried to the window without making any stops.
Surely he won't now say he put in contact lenses.
Will you?
No, I didn't have them in.
So I repeat my request that you remove them.
I think you'd better remove them.
Here.
No, I, uh...
I have a lens case.
Now, Mr. lambert, the distance between us from your bedroom window to the fountain steps.
Turn out the lights.
Objection.
If we are to re-create the circumstances under which the witness observed the defendant, surely it should be done properly, by experts.
Let's indulge defense counselor for two minutes.
Frankly, I'm curious as to where this is heading.
Proceed.
Thank you, your honor.
Mr. lambert, I'm holding in my hand an object.
Could you kindly tell the court what this object is?
It's a...
You're holding, um...
Come on, Mr. lambert.
What is it?
I can't quite make it out.
Come on, Mr. lambert.
What is it?
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Help!
Help me!
Shall I give you a hint, Mr. lambert?
Is it a cap?
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Is it a lady's slipper?
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Is it a red wig?
Well, let's try it with the lights on.
How about now, Mr. lambert?
I can see...
I can see that something's there.
But you can't identify it, not even with the lights on.
Just a book, Mr. lambert.
Just a red book.
I see why motor vehicles stipulates that you can't drive without glasses or contacts.
You're shortsighted.
Yes.
In fact, you're extremely shortsighted.
I don't know about extremely.
Wouldn't you agree that a person who failed to distinguish an object in a brightly lit courtroom from 20 yards away could fairly be described as extremely shortsighted?
Yes.
Wouldn't you also agree that it would be unlikely that an extremely shortsighted person could positively identify someone glimpsed at night from 22 yards away for only a few seconds?
You never said you're nearsighted!
You never asked.
With motor vehicle registration!
Accused assailant Chris Henderson the case against him dismissed for insufficient evidence.
Baltimore police report no new leads in the so-called dumpster murders.
Could I talk to you, please?
I'm your neighbor.
It's funny how two people can live so close and...
My name is Kathy.
Kathy hoffner.
Terry lambert.
Oh, please excuse the way I look.
I'm such a slob today.
I heard your footsteps on the stairs, and I thought it was probably you, so I just threw this on and came out.
Well, I'm just getting home.
I didn't know whether to say anything,
I feel funny about talking behind people's backs.
Talk to who?
The police.
The police.
Oh, you mean back then.
I talked to them back then, too.
They asked me if I was awakened by the attack.
They were here again today.
Today?
They asked me if I saw you that night.
Seen me?
First I thought I hadn't.
Then I remembered that I had peeked out when I heard footsteps coming up the stairs.
I was nervous after what had happened.
What did you see?
I saw you coming back in.
This was later, after the excitement had died down.
I went out for some air.
Did you see me go out?
The police asked me the same question.
I just saw you coming in.
Must have been after 3:00.
Oh, I'm sure it wasn't that late.
No.
Thanks for letting me know about the police.
Anytime.
anytime at all.
[Knock on door]
You heard they let him go.
It's sickening, isn't it?
Want a beer?
Thanks.
I would.
So that's the famous bedroom window?
Yeah.
Do you mind?
I know, Terry.
What?
It wasn't you in the bedroom window.
She was the witness.
She saw it, not you.
Who?
I'm sorry they let him go.
But you went forward...
Save it, Terry!
I saw her in the park, and I saw her in court coaching you.
Pathetic.
What, is she married?
Must be, to someone powerful.
It doesn't matter, really.
What matters is he's out there, free.
There's nothing that can be done about that.
They can't try him again.
Not for attacking me, but with some more information, they might be able to get him for what he did to the others, the girls that didn't have someone like you to protect them.
The question isn't what am I going to do, it's what are you going to do and what is she going to do?
Now it's my turn to watch.
Thanks for the beer.
[Click]
[Click]
Terry!
The cops have been here.
They just left.
Here?
They want me to call them?
They don't want to talk to you...
They wanted to talk about you.
About me?
How long you've been here, what you're like.
They also want to know about the night of that party we had.
What your mood was, why you left early.
It's almost as though they suspect you of something.
Did they ask anything else?
If I'd noticed anything unusual about you on April 26 or 27.
What?
They think you keep a diary of my moods?
Why would they ask about those dates in particular?
Who knows?
Anyway, thanks, Collin.
I'm sorry they bothered you.
The police don't know about you, not yet.
They've been questioning my neighbors.
I think they've tapped my phone.
[Child laughs]
They've been watching me.
She saw you in court.
She's figured it out.
[Sighs] I don't know what you're talking about.
Terry, you made a mistake, a simple mistake.
The police wouldn't do that.
They were at the office this morning questioning Collin.
Collin?
that's right.
Why would they question Collin?
About me!
Sylvia!
That's what I'm trying to tell you!
Do they suspect you were...
With somebody?
I don't know what they suspect.
It looks like they're wondering if maybe I didn't kill those girls.
They're trying to put the blame on somebody else.
It's ridiculous.
You're being paranoid.
Anyway, what did they talk to Collin about?
They asked about April 26, that's the date of the second murder.
They also asked him about the night of the party...
Why I left early.
The party?
What if Collin starts thinking about the party?
Well, one way, that would partially solve our problems.
What do you mean?
You wouldn't need to be so afraid to go to the police.
Go to the police?
I can't do that.
You know that.
You've always known.
Besides, I think you're exaggerating the whole thing.
What about the redhead, Henderson?
If you'd testified, he wouldn't have.
I never said it was him.
I was never sure.
You made up your own mind about that.
If it was him, he could do it again.
Stop it, Terry.
That's not fair.
It's not my fault this is happening.
Besides, it'll work out.
The police aren't fools.
What about Denise connelly?
Who?
The girl that was attacked!
She knows all about us.
Tell her we need a little time.
I have to think.
She'll be reasonable, won't she?
Maybe.
She has to be.
I didn't get us into this.
You know that.
I have to go now.
I do.
I never even knew you wore contact lenses.
Little reverse english, you'd have done all right, al.
Thanks, Denise.

She saw it, but she wouldn't go forward, so you took her place.
I thought I could bring it off.
And she let you?
You're either a romantic fool, or you're an idiot.
I don't know which is worse.
What does she say now, now that you're in a spot?
She wants to wait...
Give time to the police to sort it out.
You don't understand her position.
Sure, I do.
She has a husband and a stud on the side, and nobody the wiser.
She wants to keep it that way.

Yeah.

Mr. lambert?
Good morning.
Would you mind coming with me?
Detective quirke and I would like to talk to you for a few minutes.
Shall I follow you?
That's okay.
I'll bring you back.
Mr. lambert.
Seems you haven't been exactly truthful with us.
Oh, yes.
I'm sorry about the contacts.
That's our fault.
We should have asked.
I'm not talking about that.
We've learned that you went out that night.
You told us you were in bed.
Yes.
That you were awakened, you witnessed the attack, and then you went right back to bed.
Yes, I did go out.
I...
I forgot.
You forgot?
Yes, I... [indistinct]
Yeah, I did.
It's...
When did you go out?
Uh, afterward, before I went back to sleep.
I went to get some air and look around.
I was all keyed up.
It's...
When did you come back?
A few minutes later.
That's why I forgot.
Look, I know that you've been questioning my neighbors and my boss, and you've been having me followed, but I...
Look, you don't really think that I'm...
I'm not a suspect, am I?
Suppose you tell us about the bar.
What bar?
Where the murdered girl Stephanie lugie spent the last hours of her life, where no one...
No one...
Can remember having seen the redhead Chris Henderson.
Cocktail waitress remembers you quite clearly.
She spilled a drink on you.
Was that something else you forgot?
Where did you get that picture?
Am I...
Are you arresting me?
No.
Not just yet.
We're moving a little slower this time around.
I don't think I should answer any more questions until I consult an attorney.
That might be well-advised.
[Telephone rings]
Hello.
What are you doing?
You can't just call here!
We have to talk.
That's impossible!
I have to see you right away.
No!
I can't see you.
I can't see you at all anymore.
I've been to the police.
They've been questioning me.
It doesn't matter.
I can't see you, and I can't talk to you.
Sylvia, don't make me...
I have to go now.
Don't hang up on me!
Goodbye!

Who was that, dear?

Was she expecting you?
I'm sorry, but she isn't here.
You tell her, or shall I?
She's not here.
No one's here.
Where are they?
Damn it!
Where have they gone?
The ballet.
They've gone to the ballet.
[Car door opens and shuts]
[Engine starts]
[Indistinct talking]
[A midsummer night's dream playing]
I don't know.
Listen, I'm going to talk with him.
What are you doing here?
You gave me no choice.
Are you crazy?
People will see us!
We've gone past where any of that matters.
You may have.
I haven't.
Our affair, the fact that you witnessed the attack...
I've told you...
I will never, never
Sylvia!
I've told you that from the start!
Shh!
Don't touch me!
They suspect me of murder.
I've been followed.
They may have followed me here.
They may be watching me right now.
Then you leave me no choice but to talk to Collin myself.
I'm sorry, Terry, but it's too late for that.
I've already told him.
I had a feeling...
Told him what?
That I went to bed with you... once.
On condition I swear I was in bed with him the night of the party.
He doesn't want to be dragged into that mess!
I told him I would.
Hey!
are you all right?
Yeah, thank you.
I'm fine.
I had to.
I had no choice.
And I told him you'd been after me ever since to continue the affair, to say I was with you when I wasn't.
You'll have to find some other way to solve your problems.
There is no other way.
With or without you, I'm going to the police.
Well, you do what you have to do...
And I'll do what I have to do.
Goodbye.
It was him, wasn't it?
The redhead?
Let go of me, please.
You were sure, weren't you, right from the beginning?
You were sure it was Henderson.
All right.
I was sure!
Of course I was sure.
There's nothing wrong with my eyes.
[Sigh]
The act is almost over.
It would be better to wait.
Of course.
What's going on?
Oh!
Mmm mmm mmm!
Ah!
Ah... ah...
Sylvia!
[Applause]
You bastard!
Grab him!
He stabbed my wife!
Unh!
Get him!
Aah!
Oh!
Oh, god!
Aah!
He killed my wife!
Stop him!
Aah!
Call the police!
Aah!
aah!
Get him!
Get him!
Aah!
aah!
He's the killer!
[Indistinct talking]
You're not supposed to be back here.
Hey!
Security!
Get security!
Yeah... [indistinct] The back door.
[Indistinct talking]
[Police siren blaring]
Tonight the Baltimore social community is shocked over the murder of one of its own.
But police refuse to speculate here at the townsend theater is connected to the so-called dumpster murders.
An employee of the dead woman's husband,
Collin wentworth, was a witness to an earlier related assault.
Police are seeking him for questioning.
Thank you, Craig, for that live minicam report.
Hundreds of schoolchildren swarmed aboard the tall ship...
Denise...
Oh!
Oh!
Ow!
Denise!
Oh, my god.
I don't believe it.
Well, here it is.
Good night.
Yeah.
Thanks, Peter.
Good night.
So, what do you want me to do?
I'll tell them everything and try to get them to believe me.
You'd seen us together.
You saw Sylvia at the trial.
Why shouldn't she be at the trial?
But Denise, you know she was the real witness.
I can say I think that.
I can't prove it.
Those people at the townsend theater will say they think you killed her.
[Tires screeching]
I led him straight to her.
I knew I was being followed, but not that it was Henderson.
And he couldn't have planned it better.
He got rid of the one person that could implicate him and the one person that could clear me.
So now it looks like I was trying to shift the blame from the beginning.
Let's go upstairs.
Want a beer?
Yeah.
Tell me something.
You didn't suspect me like the police.
Why?
I knew something the police didn't.
Remember the first time we met?
The line-up?
How could I forget?
I knew something was wrong even then.
It was obvious you'd never seen me before, from your bedroom window or anyplace else, and you were completely indifferent to what you did see.
Not flattering, perhaps, but upon reflection, trustworthy.
You weren't interested in fucking me, and you certainly weren't interested in killing me.
You weren't interested, period.
He'll do it again, you know.
Kill some girl, or try to.
I'll be safe in jail.
The perfect alibi.
I wonder what sets him off.
Between the 2 of us, we know more about it than anybody.
You were there that night at the bar when he picked out that sorority girl.
The night he attacked me, I don't remember him at the bar, but he was probably there watching me.
Do we look alike at all, that other girl and me?
Not really.
What made him single her out?
What made him notice her in particular?
Well, everybody noticed her.
What do you mean?
Well, she danced.
Danced...
to a record?
With her friends cheering her on.
She was sexy.
You didn't dance for him, did you?
Sure.
On a Thursday night, the place is packed.
I don't have time to breathe.
Did anything unusual happen that night?
It was Peter's birthday.
Peter?
I remember, because the next day, after what happened, he told me I should have given him the present he wished for...
He wanted me to go home with him.
What happened that was so unusual?
At midnight...
We'd gotten him a cake...
And at midnight, c.C. And I brought it out.
[Synthesizer music playing]
Okay, you guys!
This one's for Peter!
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday, dear Peter ♪
♪ happy birthday to you ♪
Yay!
[whistles]
Peter made a wish and blew out all the candles.
And then I kissed him.
Yes, I kissed him, and so I kissed him again, and they cheered even louder.
Whoa!
[whistles]
Then he kissed me.
I mean he really kissed me, and everybody went crazy.
But you don't remember him there, Henderson?
At that other bar, either, the one where you saw him.
Another beer?
Yeah.
Two victims.
Both young, both pretty.
Both were in bars where they could be watched by him, and both did something that made them the center of attention.
Maybe he gets excited, too, but he wants to kill.
What a guy.
What can I do?
I'll take my chances with the police.
Do you know any lawyers?
Yeah, a guy I used to go to school with.
I thought I'd give him a call.
It might be better to go in with somebody.
You can stay here tonight if you want...
On the couch.
Call him in the morning.
Did you love her?
Sylvia?
Love...
I didn't really even know her, as we've seen.
I was just something for her to do.
I can think of worse things to do.
Here.
[Door opens]
You're awake.
What time is it?
About 4:30.
Listen... why don't you come into my room?
I'd like you to.
I find you attractive.
I mean, that's not true.
That is true, but...
That's not the real reason.
Ever since that night,
I haven't been able to...
To do certain things.
Tonight, I think I could,
I mean, if you... want to.
Come here.
Come here.
There's a bed in there.
What's wrong with this?
Nothing, I guess.
Terry?
Come here.
What's wrong?
Wait a second.
[Taps squeak]
Things are definitely looking better to me this morning.
Me, too.
I was thinking.
About it being only a matter of time with Henderson, and sooner or later, he'll kill again?
Yeah.
And that would clear up your problem?
It could happen sooner instead of later, with a little help.
What do you mean?
Think about it.
Some girl who could inadvertently push his buttons.
That could take a long time.
What if some girl who knew what buttons to push deliberately set about pushing them?
A girl who was his type?
Forget it.
Why?
I won't let you.
Why?
It's dangerous.
Not if you help.
We won't let it be.
No.
I said forget it.
Thank you.
I appreciate the offer.
It's no more than you did for her.
That I was either a romantic fool or an idiot.
I was probably both.
You know, if I want to ahead, you couldn't stop me.
You'd be in custody, remember?
But I do have my own reasons for wanting him caught.
He assaulted me.
If I thought you were serious...
It would never work.
He wouldn't go for you again.
He'd know it was a trap.
Not if he didn't recognize me.
You just don't think I'm sexy enough to make him try.
Why wouldn't he recognize you?
Because, Terry, I'm a woman, in case you still haven't noticed.
How do I look?
Uh, detective quirke, it's Terry lambert.
Never mind that now.
You've got it all wrong.
Uh, I want to give myself up.
I do, but just to you...
And detective Jessup.
Well, there's something I want you to do.
No, not now.
Tonight.
Look, one more day won't make a difference.
Look, just be at this number after 10:00.
I'll tell you about it then.
Just be there.
What did you do to your eyebrows?
Dyed.
fake eyelashes.
What do you think?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[Metal grinding]
Why would he have to work late tonight?
Why not?
What if he doesn't go out?
What if he goes home after work?
Then that's it.
I call quirke.
Look.
[Welding]
[Indistinct talking]
Now, remember.
Stay back a little.
Watch me in your rear-view mirror.
I'll be right behind you.
Go...
You better hurry.
Go.
We don't get separated, no matter what happens.
You lose me, stop and wait for me to catch up.
But by then, he'd be...
We don't get separated no matter what, agreed?
Agreed!
[Engine sputters]
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on!
[Engine starts]
Not one of your better places in town.
There's a phone booth right back there.
Let's go over it one more time.
I go in and try to set the hook.
If it looks like he's gonna go for it...
I call quirke, tell him what's happening, to get over to your place and meet me there.
I drive home with Henderson following.
If he goes for me, quirke's there to see it.
Mm-hmm.
You have the mace?
It's in my pocket.

Listen, bitch, I know this is a police frequency.
I've just stolen a police car.
Now, let me speak to detective quirke.
Get out of the car you have stolen and go to a telephone.
Can anybody else out there hear me in any other police cars?
Negative.

What did you put in his ignition, toothpick?
Paper clip.
Cute.
So what happens now?
There's still the matter of perjury and obstruction of justice.
I'd say he's looking at 10 to 12 years.

I've never been one to put much faith in doctors.
I've got a couple of months, Emma.
Not much more.
[Woman] Tonight on Murder, She Wrote.
It's as if he suddenly found a reason to go on with his life.
- So the killer knew she wouldn't eat it-
- It's the sort of thing that my cousin Jessica would have thought of.
I want that relationship terminated-now!
We found him in his bed, stiff as a board and cold as ice.
- What are you suggesting?
- Poison.
Poison.
Oh, good Lord!
And he suspects me.
[Bell Dinging]
[Man, Woman Laughing]
That old persimmon?
He's too mean to die.
[Chuckles]
I engaged him myself at the music hall a few years back.
Oh, that was the sorriest three weeks of my life.
I don't know which was worse- the horses or the gin.
[Laughing] Thank you.
Ever think about goin' back up on the stage yourself, Em?
Me?
Sing again?
Oh, this voice isn't what it used to be.
It's got more cracks than an old teapot.
[Chuckles] Not to mention the rest of me.
Excuse me, Miss Emma MacGill?
- Yes!
- The same Miss MacGill who played the Newberry Music Hall...
- the summer of 1943?
- My goodness, you've got...
- a good memory, uh-
- Humphrey Defoe, madam.
Oh, a solicitor.
I have to speak to you immediately, on a matter of grave urgency.
Privately.
- Well, we'll be off, love.
- All right, dear.
Now come on, Pru, tomorrow's another a workin' day.
Be seein' you, Em.
Good night, love.
Nice meetin' you.
[Chuckles] Come on, old girl.
Come on.
Come here and sit.
Pull up a chair.
Thank you.
Now what's all this about the old Newberry?
An old friend of yours wishes to see you again, Miss MacGill- the 18th Viscount Blackraven.
Oh, go on with you- Viscount what of who?
You're putting me on.
[Laughs]
Perhaps you remember him better as Lieutenant Geoffrey Constable.
Geoffrey?
Geoffrey's a Lord?
And he wants to see me after all these years.
I've been authorized to give you this.
Oh, exciting.
- A thousand pounds?
- A gesture.
For your time and trouble.
Well, he must be daft.
Thinkin' he has to bribe an old friend to pay a call.
- He was afraid you wouldn't remember.
- Oh, I remember, Mr. Defoe.
L
- Oh, yes I do indeed.
And, uh, well, I'd be honored to pay a call on His Lordship.
- And delighted.
- Good.
9:00 tomorrow morning, then.
All right.
I'll pick you up at your flat.
Very good.
Oh, and Miss MacGill, there's something you should be aware of.
The urgency of which I spoke.
The viscount is dying.
He has only a short time to live.
I'll have Hoskins get your luggage.
Oh, uh, I wasn't planning to spent the night here.
But of course you will.
It's all been arranged.
Oh.
What's the matter?
L-l
- I can't imagine what I was thinking.
L-I mean, it's 40-some-odd years ago, Mr. Defoe.
I mean, we were barely kids then- that is to say, the way Geoffrey remembers me-
Well, I'm not exactly 19 anymore, now am I?
And the viscount isn't exactly 22.
But if I may be permitted an observation, the years have treated you both very kindly.
[Sighs] Well-
Miss MacGill.
How do you do?
I'm Sybil Constable.
Geoffrey's sister.
Oh, I'm pleased to meet you, I'm sure.
I congratulate you, Humphrey.
I was certain my brother had sent you on a fool's errand.
Mother!
I will not change my plans.
Derek, I won't put up with this insolence any longer, nor will your father.
And I am not going to sit deathwatch for that senile old man... who can barely remember what day it is!
Pauline!
This is Miss MacGill.
Geoffrey's friend from London.
Oh.
How do you do?
Please excuse me.
[Starts Engine]
Derek, wait!
At least tell me where I can reach you.
Don't you understand, Mother?
- I don't want to be reached.
- [Engine Revving]
- [Emma] Geoffrey's son?
- Lord, no.
Grandnephew.
Pauline's been pampering him since the day he was born.
As you can see, 19 years of unbridled indulgence have left their mark.
Humphrey, are you sure we're talking about the same Geoffrey Constable?
My Geoffrey was so- so real, so salt of the earth.
He was, and he is.
Sybil and Pauline are birds of a different breed.
Although Sybil came by it naturally, Pauline had to learn it.
Before she married Arthur- that's Geoffrey's nephew- she was a baker's daughter, and the local ladies have never let her forget it.
[Knocking]
Come in?
[Gasps]
- Emma.
- Y-Your Lordship.
[Laughing] Lordship?
What on earth kind of greeting is that?
- [Giggles]
- Well, isn't she just as I described her?
- Indeed.
- Humphrey and I were in Burma together-
- Oh, so many years ago.
You remember Burma, Emma?
- Oh, yes.
Yeah.
Damned war.
Haven't forgiven that wretched Tojo fellow yet.
[Chuckles]
Poor old Humphrey!
L
- I spent every waking minute in those jungles telling him about you.
Kept my sanity.
Don't know what it did to his though.
- If you'll excuse me-
- By all means.
[Sighs] I can't believe this.
[Laughing] Well, no, it's... me, Emma.
Not quite so, uh, so sprightly, perhaps?
[Gasps] Oh, I wouldn't say that.
I think it's me the parade's passed by, love.
Uh, I mean, Your Lordship.
I don't know what to call you.
[Chuckles] Well, how about Geoffrey?
Sit down, sit down.
Mm-hmm.
Humphrey told you about my, uh... condition?
Oh yes, he told me, but, uh,
I've never been one to put much faith in doctors.
I can tell you-
I've got a couple of months, Emma.
Not much more.
No, it doesn't- doesn't matter.
I've come to terms with it.
But I did want to see you one more time before I- l
- I should have tried to get in touch with you before, but-
Anyway, l-I've kept track of you, over the years.
The music hall
- I know how much you loved it.
And I read about that dreadful business with Oliver Trumbull and his daughter.
Uh, somehow I always thought you'd end up marrying him.
Marriage?
Me?
Oh, no.
- Never fitted into me plans.
- Never?
Now look, Emma,
I asked you down here because I wanted to tell you about some arrangements I've made.
I've got a little house in Tuxford, on the River Trent, and I'd like you to have it.
L-It comes with a bit of income too.
A house?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, no, I couldn't possibly accept anything like that.
Please, Emma.
You must accept.
Look, I wa- I was married for 34 years.
A loveless, childless marriage, arranged by my father.
Oh, she was a good woman, but, uh- but nothing about her did ever...
touch my heart-
Perhaps because I'd left it behind in a music hall in Newberry.
[Woman] Charming, Arthur?
That woman?
Surely you'rejoking.
She's not only charming, she's quite funny as well.
Hmm.
I thought she was common and ill-bred, and your uncle's losing all grip on reality.
Oh, damn this tie.
Blame Uncle Geoffrey, darling.
His idea, dressing for dinner.
He really does live in the past, you know.
Oh, do leave him alone, darling.
He can't last much longer.
And then you, my pet, will be the 19th Viscount Blackraven, and I shall expect you to behave as such.
It really does mean that much to you, doesn't it?
Do you seriously expect me to put up a plaque at my desk at the bank saying,
"Arthur Constable, Senior Partner and Local Viscount"?
You're making fun of me.
[Chuckling] Well, of course I am.
And I don't suppose that you even care that he's giving that woman the house in Tuxford.
Frankly, I don't.
No.
Since my, uh, grandfather only died a few weeks ago, poor old Geoffrey's days as a Viscount are numbered.
- At least let him enjoy them.
- [Vehicle Approaching]
[Engine Stopping]
Oh, good Lord!
It's your brotherJohnny with one of his friends.
Well, at least it'll give Miss MacGill someone to talk to.
Blimey, Johnny.
It's like a bleedin' palace.
Aunt Syb, there's my girl!
Are you here, Humphrey?
What happened?
Somebody die?
- Happily, John, your uncle is reasonably well today.
- Ah.
Say hello to Gwen Petrie.
Gwen, my Aunt Syb, and Humphrey Defoe, family solicitor.
- Charmed.
- Humphrey, perhaps Miss Petrie would like some refreshment after her long journey.
Yes, of course.
May I fix you something, Miss Petrie?
- Oh, I could use a pint, now that you mention it.
- [Humphrey Chuckles]
How dare you bring that woman into this house at a time like this?
That woman?
Whatever do you mean, Aunt Syb?
I mean cheap, obvious!
Speaking of that, I hear she came- Uncle Geoffrey's music hall queen?
That is another matter entirely.
Look here, Auntie.
I'm here because- Well, things being as how they are,
I don't want to see myself get sliced out of the family pie... when Uncle Geoffrey wanders off into the great hereafter.
[Sighs]
I'm a dancer.
Well, actually, not a real dancer yet.
I'm taking lessons, four times a week,
And at three quid an hour, it ain't cheap, I can tell ya that.
Then what?
You hope one day to perform Swan Lake at the Royal Opera House?
Opera?
[Laughs] Oh, no, Your Ladyship.
I can't sing, not a lick.
And-And what do you do, Miss Petrie, when you're not studying?
Do?
Oh, you mean, like a job or something?
Well, I- Gwen is my personal assistant.
That's right.
Anything Johnny wants done, I do it.
- [Emma Clears Throat]
- What's the matter, Em?
- [Hoarsely] Pickled herring.
- Oh, it's ordered especially for you.
Emma and I found this wonderful little restaurant just off Leicester Square.
Used to gorge ourselves there every night after the show.
- Wonder what happened to that place?
- Oh, they closed it down soon after you left.
There was a rash of food poisoning from the, uh, pickled herring, and I got a touch of it myself, and haven't been able to look a herring in the eye since.
But it was a lovely thought.
Well, please yourself, old girl.
All the more for me.
Hmm?
Go ahead.
##[Piano:

##[Ends]
Th-That's excellent, Pauline.
Thank you.
Now, I think it'd be nice if we had a song from one of our guests.
How about it, Emma?
Me?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, no.
- Oh, please.
- Oh, but I haven't sung in years.
[Chuckles]
- For me.
Like the old days.
- Splendid idea.
I agree.
Please, Miss MacGill.
Oh well, all right. [Laughs] I'll do my best, but, uh- [Laughs] My pipes are a bit rusty.
Ta.
[Knuckles Cracking]
## [Glissando]
## [Singing English Folk Song]
That's lovely, Em.
But it's not what I want to hear.
Play-You know, you know.
Oh, Geoffrey, not here.
L-It's so many years ago, I-
- I'm not sure I can remember the words.
- Well, I can.
##[Piano]
## [Singing Flirtatious English Music Hall Song]
I would.
I would.
##[Ends]
Oh, that woman!
Pauline, please.
It's late, and we're both tired.
You actually seemed to enjoy her!
[Chuckles] Yes, I did.
And I suppose you think your uncle also should have married her 40 years ago.
Darling, he's a dying man.
Let him have these last moments.
And let her have that house in Tuxford as well?
God, no, Arthur.
Over my dead body does she get anything out of this family.
Now.
Ever.
[Cawing]
I studied voice, oh, ever so long, but Mrs. Shaughnessy- that was my teacher-
She said I had a constricted larynx, or something like that.
Well, there's lots of other teachers.
I mean, maybe you should have engaged somebody else.
I did.
This French fella said he was gonna teach me to breathe.
I said, I know how to breathe, my good man.
If I didn't know how to breathe, how was it I was talkin' to him 'stead of pushing' up daisies?
- [Laughing]
- Breathe, indeed.
Derek?
Good morning, Aunt Sybil.
I know I look bloody awful.
Well, I don't feel much better.
- Good morning, UncleJohn.
- Good morning, Derek.
Care for a spot of coffee, or something stronger?
Hair of the dog?
[Gasps] I'll settle for a hot shower-
[Yawning] And a warm bed.
I thought you had plans.
Yeah, the lady and I had a tiff.
Well, I see we're all here- awaiting the inevitable.
And how is the old boy?
Much better, actually.
I've just examined your uncle, and-
Well, I can't explain it, actually.
His blood pressure's normal, his heartbeat regular, his eyes clear-
- Oh, thank the Lord.
- Well, that's one explanation.
I certainly don't take any credit for it.
[Chuckles]
It's as if he's suddenly found a reason to go on with his life.
- You mean he's actually getting better?
- Well, if what I just saw is any indication, the viscount could go on living for another 20 years.
Good morning, good morning.
There you are, Em!
My, you look chipper this morning.
Yes, brother.
- I've never seen you better.
- Nor I, and I'm delighted.
Well, I can't spend the rest of my life rolling around in that wretched chair.
Well, why don't I fix you some nice scrambled eggs with sausages?
Just coffee for me, Em.
I don't want to spoil my appetite.
Well, you've got to eat something.
Oh, I intend to.
- We're going on a picnic.
- Oh, splendid idea, Uncle Geoffrey.
Emma and I. You scare up your own entertainment.
- Now, sir, really, I must insist-
- Blandings, when I want a medical opinion, I'll ask for it.
Food.
That's your department, my girl.
So you hop off to the kitchen.
We don't want to waste any more of this beautiful day.
No.
[Emma Laughing] Oh, my old dad would rap me over the knuckles properly, would he.
He'd say to me, "Emma darlin'," he'd say, "it's unlikely you'll ever become a lady, but there's no reason you shouldn't behave like one." [Laughs]
[Chuckling] I think I would have liked him.
Oh, you two, you would have gotten along like bread and cheese.
L
- I'm not quite so sure about the rest of your family.
Ah well, you have to understand, Emma, that, uh, snobbery runs in the family.
And it's-it's an inherited gene.
Well, Arthur's not so bad, I suppose.
But easily the best of the whole bunch was my old father, Rupert, the, um, 17 th Viscount.
- He died just a few weeks ago, did I tell you that?
- No!
Yes, good old boy.
He loved good women, good whiskey, bad cigars and chocolates.
[Laughing] And they finally got to him.
But he was 87 years old at the time.
That's something for you to aspire to.
Towards the end, Dr. Blandings tried to keep all those- those sort of things away from him.
Had him on boiled beef and vegetables, but the old boy still managed to sneak in a few chocolates... and some brandy, and had himself a midnight feast... long after everybody else in the house- [Chuckling] Oh, go on.
Yeah!
Thought he was tucked up safely in bed.
[Laughing]
And then one day, uh- It was six weeks ago on Sunday-
We found him in his bed, stiff as a board and cold as ice-
Oh.
Mmm, and a half-filled brandy snifter on the night table, and, uh, chocolate wrappers all over the floor.
Oh, dear.
Oh, there it is, over there.
There.
There.
[Sybil] It is your fault, Humphrey, for bringing that woman here.
I was merely following your brother's wishes.
Was it necessary to find her?
You should have shown more sense.
Pauline, must you?
What is done is done.
No, Humphrey, I expect you to see it's undone.
- I beg your pardon.
- My brother is a hopeless romantic.
If we don't sever this relationship now, Lord only knows what might happen.
Yes, I should certainly hope so.
I'm grateful to have been able to arrange this reunion, Sybil.
Very grateful.
You see, many years ago,
I was the one who persuaded Geoffrey not to return to Miss MacGill after the war.
I have never regretted anything more in my life than thwarting that romance.
We are all very much aware it was you... who smuggled brandy in to our father Rupert, against doctor's orders.
I saw no harm- When my brother passes on, the family will decide whether or not to retain your services.
I suggest you consider very carefully just where your loyalties lie.
I want that relationship terminated.
Now!
[Pops] Nice pickled herring, just the way you like it.
[Chuckling] This is a treat, Em.
Whoo!
[Chuckles]
[Laughs]
Looks lovely and cool.
Now, before we start- To you, Em, and to one of the happiest days I've spent in years.
To even better days.
And you're welcome to all of that, because I'm just going to have a nice peach, and a bit of cheese.
What did you mean by that?
Even
- Even better days?
Well, what the doctor said, about how well you looked.
You've got many good years ahead of you, Geoffrey.
There's no doubt about it.
Well, they could be good years, Em, if I had someone to share them with.
[Chuckles] Know what I'm driving at?
Now don't be silly.
No, I'm not being silly.
I mean, who's gonna stop us?
Family?
Well, the devil with them.
No, we-we've wasted precious years, Em.
Let's not go on making fools of ourselves-
[Grunts] Geoffrey?
Geoffrey, what is it?
- [Groaning]
- Geoffrey!
Oh, I can't, can't breathe-
- We must get you to the doctor.
- Go for help.
Go!
Now!
Run!
Everything is just the way we found it, Inspector.
What about the woman that was with him?
Miss MacGill?
Back at Blackraven.
I thought it best she not return to the scene.
And the family?
How much do they know?
Oh, nothing yet.
Ironic.
Heart attack, and only this morning he was feeling so chipper...
I thought he could go on for another decade.
A heart attack?
That's what you think, Doctor?
- Why, yes, I've-
- I want an autopsy performed as soon as possible.
Inspector, may I remind you this is- was- the Viscount Blackraven-
I don't care if he was the bleedin' Duke of York.
Sergeant, collect this food.
All of it.
I want a laboratory analysis on my desk by the end of the day.
- Inspector, surely you don't suspect-
- Doctor, the autopsy.
[Man] Inspector Frost.
I'm Sybil Constable, Inspector.
My brother?
I'm afraid we were too late, madam.
My condolences to you and to the rest of the family.
Thank you, Inspector.
The viscount had been ill for quite some time.
His death was not totally unexpected.
Uh, with your permission, ma'am, I should like to talk to a Miss...
Emma MacGill.
She's on the terrace.
Ah, thank you.
Inspector,
I'm Pauline Constable, wife of the new viscount.
If you have any questions, please direct them to me.
I will talk to Miss MacGill myself.
Excuse me.
Insolent little man.
- Dead?
- I'm afraid so.
Oh, no!
[Crying]
Oh!
If it's any comfort to you, Miss MacGill, he died almost immediately.
There was nothing you could have done for him.
[Sobbing]
I do have some questions I have to ask in, uh- in private.
I think I'll stay, if you don't mind, Inspector.
- Emma needs a steady arm to lean on just now.
- And you are who, sir?
Humphrey Defoe.
Oh, yes.
You're the family solicitor.
Yes, Mr. Defoe, perhaps you should stay.
Uh, Miss MacGill, this picnic- Whose idea was it?
It was Geoffrey's.
I see.
And who prepared the food?
- I did.
- Did you have any help?
Oh, not a bit.
I mean, they gave me the run of the kitchen, as it were.
In fact, Inspector, is there any point to all these questions?
Yes, sir.
We're not absolutely certain that the victim died of natural causes.
- What?
- There was a sallowness to the skin, a sort of cloudiness in the eyes, and some of the food smelled tainted.
- What are you suggesting?
- Poison, Mr. Defoe.
Of course, we won't know anything certain until the results of the autopsy have been disclosed.
I hope I'm wrong, but please keep yourself available.
Poison?
Oh, good Lord.
And he suspects me.
[Woman] Let me assure you again, Pauline, how much I deplore... the dreadful behavior of some members of the Flower and Garden Society.
Well, I shall personally make certain that those unfortunate incidents are not repeated.
- How very kind.
- Several of us would like to invite you to luncheon.
[Pauline] Perhaps tomorrow?
Oh.
Oh, but of course.
I had merely assumed-
I think it's time that the ladies of the shire got acquainted with the, uh, new viscountess.
Shall we say your house, Mrs. Dexter-Hundley?
I like to eat precisely at 1:00 sharp.
Something light.
I always believed that we should try to, uh, watch our waistlines.
Oh, yes, of course, Viscountess.
Oh, thank you.
Bye-bye.
Arthur, please hurry!
We'll be late for the vicar.
[Bell Tolling]
It seems like only a few days ago we gathered here to put to rest your dear father Rupert.
It was a few months ago, Reverend Twilley, and after all, he was 87 years old.
Oh, but a strong and energetic man nonetheless.
[Chuckles]
I have heard rumors- untrue I'm sure- that Geoffrey may have been the victim of foul play.
You'd have to ask Inspector Frost about that, Vicar.
Oh, I'm sorry, Sir Arthur, I meant no offense.
For pity's sakes, Vicar, do drop all this title business.
- But, sir, you have succeeded to the title.
- I'm afraid my wife... is more enthusiastic about that than I am.
[Whinnying]
Derek, don't you think this is a bit inappropriate?
Sorry, Aunt Sybil.
Can't be helped.
I hate to bother you, Mother, but Georgie Tompkins is organizing a trip to Grenoble, and-
Well, I need a few hundred pounds.
We'll discuss it later.
No, Pauline, we will discuss it now.
First, school was too taxing for you, Derek, and then working in the bank was obviously beyond your skills as well.
Arthur.
It seems that your interests are limited to skiing, tennis, and romantic entanglements.
I'm sorry, but the dole has dried out.
From now on, if you want money to finance your frivolous lifestyle, you're gonna have to earn it.
Doing what?
I haven't the foggiest notion.
Arthur, you and I will chat about this privately back at the manor.
No, Pauline, I am the Viscount Blackraven now.
A title which one day will pass to you, Derek, and I intend to see that you become worthy of the succession.
Fine, Father.
Whatever you say.
Meanwhile, what do I tell Georgie and the others?
Tell them to have a nice trip.
[Inspector Frost] Strychnine.
The herring was laced with it.
Enough to kill an elephant.
Oh, dear.
Poor Geoffrey.
Inspector, if it is your intention to charge Miss MacGill- No, it isn't, sir- not at the moment anyway.
The family were very quick to tell me about your inheritance, Miss MacGill.
And as you suspect, they are all convinced that you are responsible.
However, I don't share that dim view.
But I must insist, ma'am, that you are totally candid with me.
Oh, yes, sir.
This herring-
I understand that it was a great favorite of the late viscount.
Uh, he mentioned it at dinner last night.
Oh, yes.
He did.
I couldn't stand the sight of it, meself.
So, this morning, you prepared this herring?
Yes, l-I, well, I just used what was left over from last night.
Hmm.
I see.
So, you packed the basket, and then what?
Well, uh, then I went upstairs to- to get into somethin'more comfortable for the picnic.
Leaving the basket unattended.
For how long, would you say?
I see.
You are suggesting that anyone in the house could have doctored the food with poison.
Oh, not the food, Mr. Defoe, the herring.
Specifically the herring.
You see, Miss MacGill had made a big point about not liking it.
Everybody at the table must have heard you.
So the killer knew she wouldn't eat it, making her a perfect foil for a murder charge.
I would correct you only on one point, Inspector.
Not everyone heard Miss MacGill's comments about the herring.
Hmm.
Young Derek was out of the house last evening, as I was.
One of the family killed Geoffrey?
But why?
- He was such a dear, sweet man.
- [Chuckles]
Where money is concerned, or a title for the taking, the human race is capable of practically anything.
- Oh, dear me.
- What is it, Miss MacGill?
Oh, nothing.
I was, uh, I was just remembering something... that, uh, Geoffrey had said to me.
- Yes?
- Oh, no.
I'm being very-very suspicious, and that's not like me, not one bit.
Oh, Emma, please.
Whatever it is, for your own sake, share it with us.
Well, sir, it's about what you said, you know, about titles and money and all.
I mean, if someone was- was desperate enough to have poisoned Geoffrey, might not they also have poisoned... the old gentleman as well?
You mean Rupert?
Emma, he was 87.
He died in his sleep.
Maybe he did, Humphrey, but maybe he didn't.
Now, Geoffrey told me that his dad had this habit... of drinking brandy and eating chocolates just before he went to sleep.
He also said that when they found him in the morning, his body was ice cold- now that says to me that he must have been dead for quite some time.
That's nonsense.
Is it?
I think Miss MacGill has made a very good point.
Well, i-it's the sort of thing that my cousin Jessica would have thought of.
Cousin Jessica?
A mystery novelist.
[Chuckles]
And something of an amateur detective.
Well, madam, there is nothing amateurish about your supposition.
Nothing whatsoever.
Exhume my grandfather's body?
Inspector, you overstep your authority.
On the contrary, sir.
As I'vejust told you, the autopsy we conducted on the late Geoffrey Constable... does reveal large doses of poison in his system.
Poison administered during a picnic luncheon with Miss MacGill.
Obviously, that woman murdered my brother to protect the inheritance he'd promised her.
No, Madam, what is obvious is that two Viscounts Blackraven... have died within months of each other.
Both in very mysterious circumstances.
And I have to satisfy myself that there is no connection.
Hoskins?
Hoskins!
[Hose Spraying]
- Oh, good morning, ma'am.
- Make sure the car is absolutely spotless.
I have a luncheon engagement at 1:00.
I shall be leaving the house promptly at 12:45.
- Uh, do you wish me to drive you, ma'am?
- No, that won't be necessary.
[Engine Revving]
[Groaning]
- Good morning, Pauline.
- I didn't expect to see you here, Ernest.
I thought you'd be at the churchyard.
I came by to pick up Miss MacGill.
Ah, here she is.
I needn't tell you how distressed I am about this whole business.
So am I, I assure you.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
[Sighs] Oh, that poor woman, she really does think that I bumped off dear old Geoffrey.
They're all under a terrible strain.
This business of the exhumation-
That Inspector is out of his bloody mind.
Johnny?
Good morning.
Not planning to shoot someone, I hope.
That would give the Inspector something to talk about.
No.
Derek and I are going to do a little shooting at Brinley Woods.
Oh!
Do you think that's appropriate, considering the events of the last two days?
No less appropriate than your luncheon to lord it over the ladies of the shire.
I've never been one for false sentimentality, Pauline.
Neither have you.
Let's not start now.
[Bell Tolling]
Inspector, is this desecration really necessary?
If it wasn't, Reverend, I wouldn't be here.
Oh, dear, I feel very nervous.
What if I'm wrong?
You mean, what if we're wrong, Miss MacGill.
Actually, the more chilling question is, what if we're right?
[Engine Stopping]
[Car Door Closes]
- I see no evidence of the family.
- Oh, they're an angry lot.
- I think they'd like to kill me.
- If you're right, at least one of them would.
- Johnny Constable.
- You've learned something?
My friends in London tell me that young Mr. Constable, the budding real estate tycoon, is involved with some very shady people from the Middle East.
He has money problems, Emma.
Perhaps severe enough to kill for, but I couldn't get any details.
Well, could be you've been asking the wrong person.
[Gwen] Oh, I'm not afraid of work, Emma.
And dedication too.
No time for anything else- home, friends, family.
Forget all of that.
Oh, that's all right with me.
Oh, and how does Johnny feel about that?
I mean, I felt that- Well, you and he-
[Chuckles] A fool could see, from the way he looks at you.
[Chuckles] Oh, Johnny's all right.
He'll understand.
I couldn't help but notice that he seemed a bit, you know, put off.
Are things not going so well for him?
Dreadful, I can tell you.
He's in deep with these Arab fellas.
Promised 'em all sorts of things, he did, and now he can't deliver.
Nasty people, the lot of'em.
Oh, dear.
Johnny came this weekend to borrow 100,000 quid from his uncle, but the old gentleman died before he had a chance to talk to him.
He was so sure he'd get the money, especially after what happened to the other gentleman.
Uh, his Great Uncle Rupert?
A couple of months ago, Johnny tried to borrow the money from old Rupert.
Turned Johnny down flat, he did, and after allJohnny'd been doin' for him- bringing' him those chocolate bonbons from London all the time.
Bonbons?
Well, I must say, that was very considerate of him.
Oh, there was Holy Ned to pay when Sybil and Pauline found out about it, butJohnny didn't care.
He was just tryin'to make the old gentleman happy in his last days.
- Yes.
- And then, to turn Johnny down like that-
Oh, Johnny was mad, I can tell you that.
Oh, yes.
Uh, Gwen-
- Emma!
There you are.
- Humphrey!
What is it?
We must return to the manor at once.
There's been a hunting accident.
Young Derek Constable has just been shot.
[Gasps]
Derek shot?
By who?
I don't have any details.
I only learned of it just now, from the sergeant of police.
I must locate Pauline.
Well, she was going to have lunch with somebody a Mrs. Dexter-something-or-other.
- Dexter-Hundley.
- That's it.
- She lives only a few minutes from here.
We'll stop by.
Let's go.
We'd better hustle.
[Starting, Revving Engine]
[Vehicle Departs]
Luckily, I caught her before they started to eat.
Oh?
I thought- I also called the manor.
Derek's wound was slight.
He'd been out hunting with his UncleJohnny.
[Sighs] Johnny?
- Ernest?
Derek?
- He's all right, Pauline.
It's just a flesh wound.
He'll be fine in a few days.
Oh!
Derek, are you all right?
Luckily.
What happened?
Isn't it obvious?
UncleJohnny mistook me for a deer or something.
I didn't shoot you, Derek.
So you keep saying.
I heard a shot.
I thought somebody- All right, gentleman, all right.
[Johnny] Why in God's name would I want to shoot you, Derek?
[Pauline] Isn't it obvious?
With my son Derek out of the way, you stand in line to inherit the title right after my husband Arthur.
- Pauline, you're off your head, love.
- Am I, Johnny?
Everyone knows that you need money.
Poor old Geoffrey was poisoned, and much as the idea sickens me,
Rupert may have been poisoned as well.
What is it?
[Johnny] Not by me.
Inspector, I don't think that he did it.
No?
[Sybil] Pauline, that's a monstrous suggestion.
I agree.
Things are difficult enough without accusing each other.
[Gwen] You tell 'em, Your Lordship.
Gwen-
MyJohnny might be a bit on the gamy side, I'll admit.
But he didn't shoot anyone.
Thank you, Miss Petrie, for that contribution.
- Don't be such a bloody snob.
- [Arthur] Watch your tongue, Johnny.
Arthur, I did not shoot your son.
Well, somebody did.
I did not imagine this bullet hole.
Gentlemen, ladies.
Could I have your attention please?
Thank you.
I think justice will best be served... if Mr. Constable here comes with me down to the station.
Like bloody hell I will.
I'm putting that in the form of a request, sir.
If you prefer, I'll place you under arrest.
Why not?
I have nothing to hide.
Wait, Johnny.
I'm coming with you.
Well, I'm nearly packed, and the Inspector says I'm free to go.
- Did he?
- Yes, I'll just get my things.
[Car Starting]
I can't believe this.
My own brother.
[Humphrey] Oh, Frost's a very obstinate man, Arthur.
If I were your brother, I'd retain a barrister immediately.
Really?
No telling what may happen.
- I could recommend someone.
- It's okay.
Edgar March will be home by now.
I'll, uh
- I'll go around to his place.
I'll, uh
- I'll ring you from Edgar's, darling.
Chin up!
Can I get you something, pet?
No.
I've had enough of this for one day.
I'm going upstairs to lie down.
Don't bother calling me for supper.
Ah, Emma.
Ready already?
Oh, as well as I'll ever be.
There's a 4:45 to London, Miss MacGill.
Do hurry.
- I wouldn't want you to miss it.
- Oh, on that we agree.
[Door Closes]
[Engine Cranking]
Oh, what a pity.
It won't start.
It seldom will when you remove the distributor cap.
Well, Emma, wish us both luck.
Oh, Pauline, it won't start.
May I borrow your car?
Well, why don't you take Derek's?
I can't fit in it.
Where are the keys?
- Ah, here they are.
- No!
I mean, I'd rather you didn't.
Pauline, for heaven's sakes, let's get her to that train.
Is there some reason why we shouldn't borrow your car, Mrs. Constable?
- [Chuckles] Of course not.
- Then what appears to be the problem?
- I saw you drive away.
- Uh, that was my sergeant.
Do you have any objection to my looking in the trunk, Mrs. Constable?
I could send for a court order if needs be, ma'am.
Inspector, what is the meaning of this?
Uh, Miss MacGill says that she observed this car being washed this morning, Mrs. Constable.
Is that true?
Yes, but I- Then perhaps you could explain why you have mud on your tires.
Were you perhaps driving through the forest?
- Perhaps through Brinley Woods?
- [Gasps] No!
You left this house at 12:45, for a short trip to Mrs. Dexter-Hundley's.
For a luncheon that started at 1:00 sharp.
However, at 1:35, lunch had not been served.
Why?
Because the guest ofhonor- you, Mrs. Constable-had not arrived.
At least 35 minutes unaccounted for.
Could you tell me where you were during those 35 minutes?
That car is registered to me, Inspector.
Open the boot.
[Inspector Frost] Excuse me.
Tried to kill your own son?
No!
I wouldn't hurt him.
Not seriously.
But I had to do something!
I had to make them think it was Johnny who- Who what?
Killed my father and my brother?
Oh, don't you look at me like that.
You have always been the great lady.
You don't know what it's like to have people laughing at you behind your back, because you're a baker's daughter and you won't be anything else.
Well, I am something else!
I'm the wife of the 19th Viscount Blackraven, and I-
[Crying]
- I'll take her inside, Inspector.
- [Pauline Sobbing]
I'm sorry, Miss MacGill.
Truly sorry.
Smartly done, Miss MacGill.
If you hadn't noticed the mud on the tires-
Have you ever considered, uh, becoming a detective?
Me?
[Laughs] Oh, go on with you.
No, really.
You have a knack for it.
Do I?
Well, let's just say it runs in the family.
[Laughing]
(Seagulls)
Look, Roger.
Corfu.
(Horn)
(Horse neighs)
(Speaking Greek)
- Oh, stop coughing, Gerry, son.
- I have catarrh, actually, Larry.
No longer.
Nobody contracts or keeps catarrh on Corfu.
Not even you.
- Catarrh is Bournemouth.
- Roger.
You really are the sorriest looking specimen I've ever seen.
- (Boat horn hoots)
- Oh, no, no.
You are, Leslie.
Oh, no.
No, you are, Margo.
You'll all be clapped into quarantine and sent back to Bournemouth and I wouldn't blame them.
Come on.
(Roger barks)
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.
- Mind...
Gerry with his catarrh, Margo with her drippy nose.
Oh, Mother, take those winter wrappings off.
We're here for our health.
Don't keep on, dear.
I'm sure we'll all feel much better very soon.
There's no need to rush into health.
(Shouting)
(Greek accent) What you got, Christaki?
You got some Englis?
(Speaks Greek)
It's for spots.
Bots.
Bang, bang.
Bam, bam?
They're caterpillars.
Very soon they're going to be chrysalids.
How long do you stay here at Corfu, madame?
Oh, for ever.
Well, un, un, at least until Larry, erm, my eldest son, he's a writer...
Well, until he decides that we move again.
- English?
- Bournemouth.
Bonmouth.
Well, we've sold the house.
House.
(Roger barks)
Roger, Roger, come here.
Oh, Leslie, shoot that damn dog.
(Shouting)
A-ya.
Hey.
(Laughs) You should get someone who speaks Englis.
I am Spiro Agiapoulos.
(Kiss)
(Horn)
They alls here calls me Spiro Americano.
I haves beens to Chicago.
Which is a spot in America.
For eight years in this place.
I makes moneys.
You want bathrooms?
Oh, yes.
Yes, indeed.
- All Englis always want bathrooms.
- (Sneezes)
Every time I drives Englis, they ask for bathrooms.
You gots the sneezes?
Oh, I'm afraid we've all been suffering rather from the weather.
Leslie's developed dreadful ear trouble.
Something to do with bangs.
He shoots.
- And Margo, Margo's covered in spots.
- Mother.
- Gerry's been all right, haven't you, dear?
- Yes.
Bit sniffly, but then he never minds anything as long as he can put it in a jam jar.
Oh-ho.
We stops.
- (Man chants in Greek)
- We must be respectfuls.
Excuse me, Mrs Durrells.
Moment.
Very sorrowfuls.
(Chanting continues)
- (Leslie) What on earth's going on?
- Must be an epidemic.
There's so many of them.
It's unnatural.
- People do it all the time, don't they?
- What?
- Die.
- Not in bunches, they don't.
Perhaps they save them up until they've got enough to make it worthwhile.
- What is this?
Out.
- (Yelps)
Out.
Who are you?
- Out.
Out.
- (Barking)
Off.
Shoo.
- Shoo.
- (Barking continues)
OK.
We go.
(Engine starts)
(Horn)
(Spiro) Oh, the dogs.
Get away, you mangy pack.
Get away.
Go on.
There you ares.
There is the villa with the bathrooms.
Come on.
- Do we think yes?
- Oh, we do think yes.
- Yes.
- Oh, yes.
(Cicadas chirrup)
Come on, Roger.
Gerry?
- I'm here.
- Have you had enough breakfast?
- Honey and things?
- Yes, thank you.
We're going to get the baggage out of customs.
- Don't touch that.
- It's my duty, Spiro.
Don't give me duties.
I know your duties.
You, Christaki, were fined 12,000 drachma for dynamitings fis.
You is the criminal, not these innocent foreigners.
- You tell them, Spiro.
- Yes.
I tell him.
Yes.
Out.
Out.
Out.
Ha, ha.
Well done, Spiro.
- (Spiro) I tell him.
- You told him.
(Donkey braying)
Oh.
(Gunshot)
- (Donkey brays)
- Put it back on the wall, Gerry.
(Muttering)
Please tell your friends not to tether their donkeys outside my window, Margo.
(Gunshot)
- They're not my friends.
- (Men muttering)
I think your sunbathing might be a little unwise, Margo.
Why?
It's attracting young men and their donkeys from all over the island.
- Really?
- I can't see why.
Well, your costume doesn't cover an awful lot.
Oh, Mother, you're frightfully old-fashioned.
I mean, after all, you only die once.
(Whimpering)
Roger found some wild bees.
Do you have to shoot your gun so near the house, Leslie?
Er, yes.
It's all your fault.
Mine?
- They're all selfish, your children.
- He tried smelling them.
You brought them up to be selfish.
I like that!
I never did anything of the sort.
We wouldn't be so selfish without guidance.
They stung him and I don't blame them.
- (Donkey brays)
- God, I won't be able to write a thing.
(Gerry) Crab spiders change colour.
Did you know that, Mother?
(Mrs Durrell) What, dea...
No.
No.
No, I didn't.
Not all at once but if you come back a day later, you can see it all happening.

I intend to work all day.
I think Gerry should do something useful.
I think he should.
What do you do?
Most things.
He needs to be educated.
Well, he can read.
I'll teach him to shoot and sail and then he can face the world.
Only if he joins the merchant navy, dear.
He should be taught to dance.
Do you know, there is not one person on this island can tango.
Literature.
The rest will follow.
I've given him a few books.
Rabelais, Lady Chatterley.
Don't you think that Rabelais is a little old for him, dear?
If he gets sex in the right perspective now, the rest'll follow.
You always drag sex into it, Larry.
No matter what.
We could talk about eggs, toast and you drag sex in.
Really, Margo.
Where is Gerry?
Look, Roger.
The swallows are back.
- (Tweeting)
- They're repairing their nest.
Hey.
You boys, you ought to be more careful up ladders.
- I'm all right.
- You don't want to worry your poor mothers.
(Larry) Why not?
(Spiro) Why nots?
Why nots?
Well, she's never done anything for us.
Why should we start to consider her?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You must not joke about such things, Master Lorrys.
- Well, he's quite right, Spiro.
- No, no.
Gollies, no.
Yes.
She isn't really much good as a mother, you know.
(Larry) All that woman ever thinks about is cooking.
- (Spiro) Don't say that.
- They won't do anything to their nest
- with you lot shouting and arguing.
- We'll shoot them.
(Laughs) Shoots thems.
The lacewing fly lay eggs, all on stilts.
Then she goes off and leaves them.
- Just like Mother.
- (Spiro) No, no, no, no, no.
Come, come, come, boys.
Honest to Gods.
If I had a mother like yours,
I'd go down every mornings and kisses her feets.
Her feets.
What is Greek for eggs, Spiro?
You don't need to know that, Master Gerrys.
You don't need to speak Greeks when I speak such perfect Englis.
(Cock crows)
Egg.
What is the Greek for egg, Agathi?
Ellinika, Agathi?
(Speaks Greek)
(Speaking Greek)
Thank you. (Speaks Greek)
(Speaks Greek) Thank you.
Thank you.
(Speaks Greek)
I'd better go now, Agathi. (Speaks Greek)
(Speaks Greek)
- (Girl) Gerry.
Gerry.
- (Gerry speaks Greek)
Gerald, these awful wriggly things, what are they?
Caterpillars?
No, they're not, as a matter of fact.
They become ladybirds, actually.
I don't want them becoming ladybirds near me.
They don't look like ladybirds.
- Well, they're going to be.
- (Mrs Durrell) Oh, I mean, I'm sure.
How about that bee you put in my cigarette box?
Why are you afflicted with this urge to fill things with animals?
It could be very dangerous.
- Do try not to.
- I forgot it was there.
- I could have been stung.
- I know.
He's got to do something.
- I think it's a healthy interest.
- (Gerry) I'm sorry.
I don't want wriggly things everywhere.
Suppose I have friends to stay?
- Well, stamp on 'em.
That's what I do.
- I'm worried about his education.
I'm worried about him turning the house into a menagerie.
I intend to have people to stay.
Aren't you worried about his education?
- I can speak lots of Greek now.
- (Larry) Yes.
I suppose it won't lead anywhere, this putting animals into things.
I wouldn't mind a bee attack if it led anywhere.
I think he's going through a phase.
He's been going through it since he was two.
I'll think of something.
If you want him stuffed with useless information,
- I'll try to find someone.
- (Roger whines)
- Come on, Roger.
- (Roger barks)
- Where are you going?
- Earwigs.
(Roger barks)
Ah.
It's a nest.
A nest of an earwig.
See the eggs?
(Cock crows)
It's no good.
I've given this villa every chance.
It's just not big enough.
- Well, it's big enough for me.
- And for me.
Yeah, well, you can't even spell.

- See it happen.
Didn't you, Roger?
- (Roger barks)
Your young mans, they adores you.
But you do not whips them enough, Mrs Durrells.
- Whips them?
- Yes, trusses them.
The young Master Gerrys, he's ignorants.
He is, er, talking to the peasants in Greeks.
He must be educates or he will speak only Greeks and be an ignorants man.
and nobodys in this whole world who speaks Greeks is anybodys.
Become a wilds boy.
(Speaks Greek)
(♪ Singing in Greek)
(Speaks Greek)
(Roger barks)
Good afternoon.
You are one of the foreigners inhabit the villa.
- The small English milord.
- I am but I'm not a milord.
What you must not do, and this is a fact, is sleep under the cypress.
- I wasn't sleeping.
- (Laughs) Excellent, excellent.
What you must not do is doze off because black cypresses are dangerous.
You may sit under them but not sleep.
You tempted.
The shadow, a good shade, longer, sleep, but never for any reason.
And here, I give you facts.
Never sleep under a cypress.
You ask why?
Because, when you wake, you are gone to the air like crazy.
Your brains. (Whistles)
Black cypresses have roots which wriggle into your brains as you sleep, then... (Whistles) Gone, your brains.
Your head will be empty as a whistle until breath is blown into it.
ls that true of all trees, all cypresses?
(Laughs) Not all.
Only the black cypress.
Only the black cypress steals your brains.
(Speaks Greek)
(Groans)
(Gerry) Beware the black cypress.
- George.
- Larry.
He's just been left to run wild but, don't break his spirit altogether.
Beware the black cypress.
(Mrs Durrell) Do you like crawly things?
(Larry) Oh, yes.
Do watch out for those.
- Beware the black cypress.
- (Mrs Durrell) I hope you can teach him before he goes completely native.
George is a friend of Larry's.
And he has kindly consented to become your tutor.
Oh, yes, Gerry.
It had to come.
Oh.
(Mrs Durrell) How does he do?
How do you do?
How do you do, Gerald?
Will tomorrow morning at nine suit you?
(Mrs Durrell) Have a cup of tea, Gerry.
(Larry) Well, don't look so glum.
No, thank you, Mother.
I'll just go and say goodbye to everything.
What does he think we're going to do to him?
That's it, I suppose.
Tomorrow at nine.
That's that, I suppose, Roger.
(Theo) ♪ I've travelled this wide world all over
♪ And now to another I'll go
♪ For I know that good quarters are waiting

(♪ Hums)
The perfect night for it.
Yes.
What did you say?
Theodore said it was the perfect night for it.
For what?
For a jolly moonlight swim.
You don't swim.
- Ah.
But if I did.
- (Laughter)
Erm, why are we going in circles?
Oh, because Mother doesn't know how to steer.
Well, if you feel you can do any better, Margo, you may take the rudder.
Yes.
- All right?
- Yes.
Rocks!
- Oh, where?
- There.
Oh, sorry.
I can never remember if it's left to go left, or left to go right.
- Shall I take over?
- No, no, no.
- Leslie.
- No, it's all right.
I've got the hang of it now.
Have any of you ever been to Albania before, dare one ask?
Margo, we're going towards Albania now.
(Margo) Oh, sorry.
(Gerry) Now we're going towards the rocks.
(Larry) Not towards the rocks, a little bit more towards Albania.
(Gerry) Rocks!
(Theo) Just a touch... (Larry) A bit more towards Albania!
Rocks, rocks, rocks.
No, no, no, just keep it there.
(Gerry) Albania!
(Larry) Rocks!
Shouldn't it be port and starboard?
- Do you know what port and starboard are?
- Well, no.
Of course not.
But shouldn't it be?
Rocks!
(Gerry) I ought to have a boat of my own, so that I can do things in it on my own, and have voyages alone, and become acquainted with the creatures of the sea without going round and round in circles.
ln fact, if anybody wants to know what I want for my birthday,
I want my own boat.
Look.
(Theo) Ah, yes.
A firefly.
(Leslie) There's thousands of them.
- Good morning, Spiro.
- Good mornings.
- Closes your eyes at once.
- What?
You're not supposed to know that I'm bringing woods.
I do hope Leslie knows what he's doing.
This piece of wood's got a hole in it.
I should never have started this.
It's growing like a blasted liner.
- The Greeks are great seamans.
- Well, so are the British.
It's OK.
I have not told him what he is gottings.
He knows what he's gotting, Spiro, what he doesn't know is what it's gonna look like.
Well, neither do I, exactly.
Well, still, it's wood.
It should float.
(Margo) Mother.
In here, dear.
Erm, we thought, Peter and I, that it was about time Gerald got back to learning things.
Peter?
- That's right.
- Have we met?
No.
No, we haven't, Mrs Durrell.
- How do you do?
- Don't start all that.
Mother, this is Peter.
He ought to teach Gerry, he knows everything.
- He's been to Oxford.
- So have I.
Twice.
(Laughs)
It-it was suggested that you might like a tutor for Gerald.
Er, me, I suggested it.
Er, will you suit?
Oh, no, I can see that you're quite a nice looking young man, but will you suit?
Gerry is odd.
- But he's quite nice, really.
- Well, I am qualified to teach.
I have a degree.
(Speaks Greek)
- You're not a dentist by any chance?
- Oh, no.
Arts.
(Lugaretzia) Oh!
Lugaretzia needs a dentist.
I suppose we'll have to take her to a Greek one.
Well, she's got Greek teeth.
Look.
It's an owl.
Just a baby, really.
Oh, isn't he sweet?
- It's a bit ugly.
- He's very brave.
I shall call him Ulysses.
It's about time you two became friends.
(Roger whimpers)
Come on, Roger.
Make friends.
(Twitters)
(Whimpers)
(Lugaretzia) No!
I suggested that she might go to a dentist, that's all.
Have you had your, er...birthday list from Gerry yet?
Cheeky little devil.
- Yes.
- Books on bats and snakes and things.
- Dozens of them.
- What does it say on mine?
"Five wooden cases glass-topped and cork..." Ah, he still can't spell.
There's a young man called Peter coming in to deal with that.
Margo found him.
"Two dozen test tubes, five pints of methyl...meth-y-lated spirits,
"five pints of formalin and a microscope."
Where I'll find all that I don't know.
Don't get him everything.
I'm not.
I always get him everything if I can.
- Was that him?
- Who?
This Peter chap, hand-in-hand with Margo in the garden.
Almost certain to be. (Sighs)
(Laughs) Mm-mm.
Margo.
Shouldn't Peter be giving Gerry lessons in...
in something?
Spelling.
You know, there's the oddest smell in my room.
Do you think it could be that owl?
Where does it do its business?
I don't know, dear.
I'd really rather not think about it.
Never again.
Why we pander to that boy, I don't know.
I should never have started it.
Having trouble?
I thought you knew all about boats.
I do!
Don't know much about Greek nails, that's all.
I suspect they're all second-hand, been straightened by some cousin of Spiro's.
Who should we get to deal with Lugaretzia's teeth?
- Well, I'm too busy.
- Oh, Leslie, be serious.
Her teeth are a torment to her.
I hope you're not going to expect Peter to spend all his time in the bug house with Gerry.
(Sighs)
(Sighs)
We're not going to spend all our time this summer indoors, are we, Peter?
I mean, you are smitten with Margo, aren't you?
Thought you were.
Everyone like you is.
Why don't you go off and look at flowers and things?
(Sighs)
Poetry, things like that.
Swimming, Margo loves swimming.
Turn to page...
What is that smell?
(Sniffs)
Yes.
I think you ought to keep a diary.
There's no point in me going over things again and again as I have been doing, nouns, verbs, adverbs, fractions, percentages, that sort of thing, when you could learn far more by applying your skill.
That's it, you must keep a diary.
I do.
Look.
I put everything into it.
That's what I've done today already.
I'm rather interested with creatures of the night at the moment, bats and owls.
Mm.
Would you rather I wrote a book?
(Peter) Hmm.
What a good idea.
Aaaaagh!
Pah, pa, pa, pa.
All have to be extracted.
The entire...entire...every one.
Thus will her body be purged of ailment.
She will sleep better also.
And her stomach will calm.
In every sense she will be sublimely happy to get rid of them.
Oh, dear.
Will you tell her, doctor, or should I?
Pa, pa, pa, pa, pa.
It will be best if she discovers it over the next few days, as if by accident.
Huh?
It'll all be over in a minute, Lugaretzia.
- Just one good pull.
- Aaaagh!
(Laughs)
What's that awful smell in the house?
- I don't know.
- I'm sure it's that dog.
It isn't the owl.
Hmm.
Has he asked you to his birthday party?
Well...yes.
Well, I'll ask you as well, just to make sure.
Good afternoon.
Oh.
(Honks horn)
(Lugaretzia moans)
I do hope she's not going to be sick.
Out!
She must get out if she's going to be sick.
(Speaking Greek)
What did she say?
I asked her how she was going to be able to eat and she said not to mention it.
More to the point, how will she be able to help me prepare the food for tomorrow?
I said that you could each have ten guests thinking that you'd each invite the same ten.
You haven't, have you?
- Hundreds are coming.
- Good.
But of course the presents I will be getting will be quite useless for my purposes.
You mean nothing to do with bugs and flying crawly things?
Precisely.
- What is that awful smell in the house?
- Don't ask me.
Larry says that he can actually smell it in his room now.
It's nothing to do with me or Roger.
(Moans)
Lugaretzia's going to be useless for days.
She is a useless womans.
Never you mind, Mrs Durrells, you leave everything to me.
I have friends who have been butlers to the kings of Greeces.
They will fix it.
(Twittering)
The only way out of this would be to let Larry die.
And I'd rather not do that.
After all, he is my brother.
(Sniffs)
I think it must be something of mine, Ulysses.
I hope it's not my chicken.
I would hate it to be the four-legged chicken as that is totally irreplaceable.
(Peter) Oh.
Hasn't he grown?
Ulysses.
Yes.
Quite quickly.
He's got very fluffy.
If he doesn't like you, he ruffles himself out.
Yes, I thought so.
It's my bat.
Hm?
(Sniffs) Oh!
No wonder Larry can smell it in his room.
I stuffed it myself.
I must admit, it has been looking rather dejected lately.
- Can you smell it?
- Ooh!
Gerry.
It is awful, isn't it?
- Did you cure it properly?
- I thought I had.
Oh, I think you'd better get rid of it.
We can always get another one.
I'll show you how to cure it properly this time.
Don't tell them, will you?
Larry and the others, I mean.
I don't think they'd understand, just that it isn't Roger or Ulysses.
They've been very good about Ulysses.
Oh, Margo.
(Mrs Durrell) Oh.
There you go, Larry.
Is the boat finished?
Oh, almost.
What are we going to do about him?
- Margo's swain?
- Mm, very wet, isn't he?
I think he's ghastly.
Do you think they're getting too fond of each other?
- Well, it's a familiar pattern.
- What about the last one?
He had to go.
You'll never let me shoot them, will you?
I can't see.
Are they...kissing each other?
Either that or eating one another.
Margo.
Last one was a Turk, wasn't he?
Hmm.
I don't know what they see in her.
I'll have to have a word with her.
She ought to stop leading young men on and just get on with it.
- Might help her spots.
- Larry.
- Well, don't you think so?
- No, I do not.
She's much too young to... get on with it.
Well, it's because he's English.
If he was another Turk, Spiro would have sorted him out by now.
They ought to be sent to Athens to live together for as long as it lasts.
Anywhere far enough away for us not to have to watch.
I'd rather blow his brains out.
- (Mrs Durrell tuts) Leslie.
- Well, wouldn't you?
I don't believe in this free love of Larry's.
There's a price to pay for everything, you know.
No.
Better to get it over and done with quickly.
Bang.
Will you marry me?
Oh, Peter.
Oh, Margo.
I'm not capable of saying.
Oh, Margo.
Oh, Peter.
Oh, Gerry, you little thing!
OK.
This must be the best birthday party there has ever been.
You must both work very hard.
I have said, "Leaves all to Spiro," to Mrs Durrells, who is a...a saint, a Madonna.
Lugaretzia, you must forget all about your bleeding gums.
(Gibbers)
(Angry exchange in Greek)
(Chokes)
You must remember you are the ex-butler to the kings of Greeces, and you must not drink!
The honour of Spiro is at stake.
Work, work, work!
Work!
Work.
Thank you.
You must forget all this nonsense about marriage, Margo.
Well, I haven't shot a man yet.
But I'm not adverse to doing so.
- Look.
- Aw. (Laughs)
More animals.
Isn't he sweet?
Doesn't Peter look handsome?
He bought a new suit.
Yes, he looks very smart.
- Oh, dear Gerry.
- (Puppy whimpers)
You're the only one who understands.
One false move and you're a dead man.
I am so sorry I'm late, but my wife has just been delivered of a baby.
- Oh, congratulations.
- Thank you.
We must drink to them both.
Ah.
- Lugaretzia.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
What's this, doctors?
You gets babies?
A boy.
A boy, Spiro.
But you got lots and lots alreadys.
- How many this time?
- Six.
- That's all.
- That's all?
That's all, that's all?
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Six.
But I love children.
Yes, how nice.
Is too manys, Mrs Durrells.
Maybe it's all right for cats and dogs.
(Laughs)
Listen, listen, listen.
When I get married...
I ask my wife, "How many you wants?"
And she says twos.
So I give her twos.
- Then I get her sewed up.
- (Snorts)
Honest to Gods, it's disgusting, it's like cats and dogs.
Six.
- Six!
- Oh, the cake.
Where's Gerry?
(Cheering)
(Speaks Greek)
Happy birthday!
(♪ Fiddle plays a jig)
(Guests) Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, Theo.
Hey, Spiro.
Come on.
Do you like it?
Really?
It's wonderful.
The best boat and the best present I've ever had.
Do you like the colour?
It's green and white inside.
Tell you what, though, it was jolly hard work.
- Wonderful.
- Come on, lads.
A little further along.
- I suppose we should wait.
- Right.
After three.
Right.
One, two, three.
(Cheering and applause)
(Theo) Well done.
Flat-bottomed, you see, very safe.
It's not like an ordinary boat.
It's round, isn't it?
Yes, well, the planks came up a bit short.
But it's the best shape there is for a boat with regard to safety, because in an emergency you can go anywhere you like.
It looks wonderful.
It looks just like a dung beetle.
(Laughter)
- Why don't you call it the Jolly Roger?
- No, not a good name.
- Are you sure it's safe?
- Safe as houses.
It needs a sort of fat name.
- Er, Arbuckle?
- Oh, yes.
Oh, tasteless.
- Ark.
Call it Ark.
- No.
Oh, all right.
Here, Margo, you get hold of the nose.
Give her the rope, Larry.
- And yes, Peter.
- Yes?
Make yourself useful while Gerry thinks of a name, then we can christen her.
- If you jump in.
- But this is a new suit.
In the boat, you fool, not the water.
We must breaks the bottles.
Right now, you see...
- Oh!
- Careful.
- All right?
- You see that socket there, Peter?
Yes, the one in front, yes, that's it.
Put the mast in there.
- In the socket.
- Oh, I see it.
Yes.
Good lord, he's done it.
I know, I shall call it Bootle.
- (Mrs Durrell) Oh, that's a good name, dear.
- I have heard of it.
I was gonna suggest Bumtrinket.
Why?
Well, it's a very fat name, Bumtrinket.
(Mrs Durrell) I've told you, Larry, you're not to teach Gerry things like that.
Wonderful.
I shall call it the Bootle Bumtrinket.
Not in front of strangers, if you don't mind.
- All right.
Well, she's ready to christen now.
- Yes.
Here is the wines, Gerry.
- I name this ship the Bootle Bumtrinket.
- (Cheering)
(Screams) Oh, Peter!
(Laughter)
Well, what do you know?
- You want to drown him on purpose!
- (Leslie) It's not deep enough.
(Larry) Oh, I don't know.
A man can drown in a couple of inches.
(All laugh)
Oh, I hate you all!
He'll drown!
He'll drown!
(Laughs) Oh, you are the most dreadful boys.
(Gerry) Thank you, Leslie.
It's the most wonderful present.
You forgot the mast...
Well, I think perhaps my present is, erm...
Well, er, many happy returns of the day.
A small memento.
Perhaps in the circumstances, a welcome addition to your library.
- Life in Ponds and Streams.
- (Laughs)
(Laughter continues)
I'm sorry.
I don't swim very well, Margo.
Oh, don't... (Coughs)
You deliberately humiliated him!
(Shrieks)
Thank you, Mother, for a wonderful party.
Isn't my boat wonderful?
And I got this book from Theodore.
Yes.
What a party.
Good.
Good.
Oh, what larks.
(Sighs)
What are you going to call the puppies?
Er, Widdle and, er...
Puke.
- What do you think, Theo?
- Oh, another foot.
It's only four foot now.
All right, then.
Look what Mother's made.
Oh, marvellous.
Hmm...
Gerry, going for a swim?
- Yes.
- Do.
The best time for swimming on Corfu, the late afternoon.
Cooler than the, um...
Hm.
We're very far from the sea on this island.
Leslie, you're so clever.
Am I?
Oh.
Well...
You've got to know something about boats, haven't you?
And the sea and things.
Come on, then.
Out you come.
It's ready.
What do you think?
Oh, yes.
She looks very seaworthy.
Compact.
Yes.
Compact.
- Well, it's just a matter of balance, really.
- I like Mother's flag.
It's called a pennant.
It shows you which way the wind's blowing, you see.
Jump in and we'll get her going.
You hold the stern, Theo.
Yes, er, yes.
I'll just get this rowlock.
There.
Lovely.
- Have the oars.
- Yes.
- Ready?
- Right.
And off you go.
Really quite stable.
Of course.
It works.
It works!
What a day!
Roger.
Roger, here!
Here, Roger!
Oh, Roger, you useless dog!
Come along, sweetheart.
Come on!
Come on.
Come on!
There's a good girl.
- Poor thing.
- (Dog whines)
- Can't stop being sick.
- (Dog vomits)
- Urgh!
- Goddamn sick puppy dog!
- What dog, Spiro?
- It's your mother's.
Your mother's.
The one that she has been given.
He is sick all over my seats, Master Gerrys.
On the journeys.
All the ways, he throws and throws and throws.
(Sighs)
It is awfuls.
Oh, isn't it sweet?
(Larry) Oh, no.
This is the most revolting animal yet to be brought into this family.
You can't tell which end is which.
What possessed you, Mother?
The man that had it said it had been abandoned.
I can't think why.
It looked so sad.
Apparently, It 's a sad breed.
- A breed?
- What's it bred for?
Oh, look!
It's been sick on my foot.
It's been sick all the time.
All over poor Spiro's car seats.
- And me.
- What's wrong with him?
Oh, it isn't a him, it's a her.
A female sea slug.
Her name is Dodo.
And she's a breed.
Come on, darling.
She's a Lhasa apso.
I don't believe it.
You mean somebody actually produced that shape?
Dachshunds are much the same shape, to go down the holes after badgers.
Well, what does she go down after?
Sewage?
No wonder she can't stop vomiting.
- Oh, Larry.
- Are you mad, Mother?
I think you must be.
A bitch?
Has It escaped your notice that all our other three dogs are males?
Larry, you always bring everything down to sex.
Apparently, they're very faithful.
Well, they'd have to be.
Maggie!
Say Spiro.
Spiro.
Spi-ro.
(Tuts)
Spir-o.
- Spiro!
- (Squawks)
(As parrot) Say Spiro.
(Squawks)
(Pig snorting)
- (Dog barking) - (Speaks Greek)
(Replies in Greek)
(Pig snorting)
- Roger!
- (Barks)
(Bird calls)
Look, Roger.
Snakes!
Isn't It beautiful?
It's beautiful.
Scales like a fir cone.
You can see them.
(Flies buzzing)
(Cicadas chirrup)
(Flies buzzing)
What about the other one?
Roger, stay here.
I'm going to see if I can get her husband.
(Roger whines)
(Roger barks frantically)
Shut up, Roger.
I think I can feel it wriggling about my feet.
It must be here somewhere.
Got him!
Got him, Roger!
- Got him!
Got him!
- (Roger barks)
(Speaks Greek)
Oh, and your health too.
Ah.
These serpents are of course quite harmless, as you know.
Thank you.
(Flies buzzing)
(Speaks Greek)
Roger.
You are a stranger.
Yes.
I'm English.
I'm living here with my family.
There's my mother, two brothers.
One of them writes all the time.
He's the eldest.
And the other - well, he shoots.
At everything.
Oh, yes!
And there's my sister, Margo.
Well, I'd better be going now.
- Where do you go?
- To the sea.
I need a good wash.
Then I might find some cockles to eat.
I go to the sea also, to my boat.
(Gerald) Are you a fisherman?
Do you come from here?
Yes.
My home was here.
But now I am at Vido.
- Vido?
- Yes.
I am a convict.
Vido is the prison island.
Yes, I know that.
Have you been released?
(Laughs) Not at all.
That is my luck.
I have two more years.
I have to be back on Monday morning.
Oh.
So sometimes they let you out?
Those of us who are persuasive.
(Gull squawking)
Ah, is this your boat?
Yes.
Take care.
He is vicious.
- (Squawks loudly) - (Speaks Greek)
He never lets anyone touch him without biting.
He must like you, huh?
He's magnificent!
Yes, he is.
How did you catch him?
It was easy.
What a bird he is.
You're very lucky to have a bird like that.
Do you think you could possibly find a baby gull for me this spring?
You like them?
Yes.
- You want one?
- What?
Of course!
You may have him.
- Don't you want him?
- He bites everybody.
All the other prisoners.
They do not like him.
I let him go.
He will not go.
I like him.
But...
He's huge - but so light!
Yes, he is.
He knows his name.
He'll come when you call.
I call him Alecko.
Tomorrow I will bring you some fish for him.
Thank you!
Adio!
Bye!
(Gull squawks angrily)
What on earth is that?
Look what he did.
- He's wonderful.
- He bit you!
- Yes.
He bites everyone.
- (Panicked squawking)
- Er, is it an eagle?
- No, It 's a herring gull, Margo.
Who's playing bagpipes?
- What on earth is that?
- It's a new bird Gerry's got.
- Isn't it fearsome?
- Oh, my God, it's an albatross.
Get It out.
We'll all go down with something.
Even having the feathers in the house is 100 years' bad luck and doomed to wander.
That's nonsense, dear.
That's...
That's peacocks.
It wasn't a peacock that did it for the ancient mariner, it was one of those bloody things.
It's gnashing its teeth!
What a whacking great gull.
- They don't have teeth.
- What did that to your arm?
Its tail feathers?
It's gnashing at something.
(Squawks)
- (Liquid splashing)
- Oh, dear.
What was that?
I think it's called guano.
About two gallons of it.
- (Trickling)
- We'll have to wear waders.
Get it out of here at once.
In fact, all of you, get out.
You'll spread It everywhere.
I've got the vicar coming.
Oh, dear!
Now, this one is called Alecko.
Can you say Alecko?
He's very fierce, as you can see.
Alecko.
Well, try Spiro, then.
Spi-ro.
Spiro.
So nice of you to come.
- Good afternoon, Gerald.
- Good afternoon.
(Angry squawking)
- It's the Reverend Harcum.
- Hm.
He plays cricket.
Huh!
All he wants is money and wickets.
Money and wickets.
Hey.
I plays cricket.
How's that, Reverend?
(Guffaws)
I...
I do hope you like egg sandwiches for tea.
Oh.
Cucumber sandwiches would be much nicer.
Cucumbers?
Er...
Would you, er...
How's the little dog?
Mrs Harcum, my wife, tells me it will let you go nowhere.
I should not be surprised if some day you should bring it to church.
But I'm bound to say that I should not allow it inside.
(Dogs scuffling and grunting)
(Dog walls)
Sex.
Mother.
I'm afraid Dodo's being passionate with Roger.
(Laughs) Oh, dear.
How affectionate.
Spiro, fetch a bucket of water.
I fetch yous twos.
(Dogs whimpering happily)
Er, now.
I've got something on my shoe.
Ah!
Yes.
That will be...
Iguano.
I'm not sure what it's good for, but isn't it very useful?
(Mrs Durrell) I'd quite forgot I had it.
Thank you for the fish for Alecko.
What is your name and...what are you in prison for?
I am Kosti Panapoulos.
I killed my wife.
Until tomorrow, uh?
(Speaks Greek)
You know, I don't know why the Harcums bothered to call.
A cup of tea, not even a sandwich, and they were gone.
Every step they took, they were up to their armpits in...
Larry.
Guano.
Oh, Gerry, what lovely fish!
How clever of you.
- How shall I cook them?
- Cook?
- They have to be eaten raw.
- Oh, no, I don't think so, dear.
They're not for you, Mother.
They're for Alecko.
(Magpie) Spiro!
Spiro!
- The magpies!
- What?
- They've done it.
- Well, I'm blowed!
- Spiro!
- (Spiro) Hello!
(All laugh)
Yes, Mrs Durrells?
It wasn't me, Spiro.
It was them.
Who's thems?
(Magpie) Spiro!
Oh!
It's magenpies.
- (Laughs) It's the goddamn magenpies!
- (Magpie) Spiro!
Spiro!
Honest to Gods, the things that Master Gerrys does!
- (All laugh)
- Spiro!
Goddamn magenpies.
If it's OK, Mrs Durrells, I go back to my house.
Of course.
We'll see you tomorrow?
Of course.
Goodbye!
Goodbye, Spiro.
(Magpie) Spiro!
Spiro!
I don't mind the magenpies in a cage, it's that blasted albatross.
It isn't an albatross.
It certainly is, as you'll find out when the cyclone hits us.
- What cyclone?
- Or hurricane, or tidal wave.
- Don't blame me If we're hit by one.
- Why, dear?
Albatrosses always bring bad weather as well as bad luck.
- And it's started.
- How has it started?
- It's peacocks that are unlucky.
- (Magpie) Spiro!
I know because an aunt of mine had feathers in the house, and the cook died.
How has it started?
- What, the cyclone?
- No, the bad luck.
Oh.
Dodo being impregnated by Roger.
It's very bad luck.
We don't know that she was.
She's looking frightfully pleased with herself.
A bit like Mother did when she had you.
That's enough, dear.
Poor Dodo.
At least she's friends with the other dogs now.
Where did you get it?
The gull?
The other day I was out catching these water...
Don't say it!
Snakes.
- Sorry, Leslie.
- I hate them!
- So do I.
- Not as much as I do.
- I admit it.
- I met this man.
He's a convict.
He's a what, dear?
He's a convict.
He's allowed home for the weekends.
He gave me those fish for Alecko.
I don't like the idea of you going about with a convict.
- You never know what he's done.
- I know perfectly well what he's done.
He's killed his wife, that's all.
He...
He's a murderer?
Why's he wandering around the countryside?
Why didn't they hang him?
They don't have a death penalty, except for bandits.
You get three years for murder and five years for dynamiting fish.
That's a nice sense of the importance of things.
(Magpie) Spiro!
(Whistling)
(Spiro sings in Greek) lt takes twice as long by boat.
Yes, I know.
But poor Dodo can't...can't travel by car.
She vomits all the time.
Not by sea.
Oh, no.
No, people who are carsick are never seasick.
Un...er...fortunately, and, er, this may prove your theory...
I have never, so far, ever been sick in a car.
But I am always sick in a boat.
(Sings in Greek)
(Whistles tune)
Lovely!
(Spiro whistling)
Perhaps the sea will remain calm for you, Theodore.
Un...er...fortunately, it is of no importance.
Er...it's motion.
I've even been forced to leave the cinema when films have been shown of ships at sea.
Any sea.
(Groans weakly)
Vacate my seat.
Help!
(Theodore) Help!
Hello!
(Mrs Durrell) Help!
- (Theodore vomits) - (Mrs Durrell) Help!
Help!
(Retches)
Help!
Ah.
Echidna.
Or, er, possibly as you would know it, a sea urchin.
Put him in.
We'll take him home.
Ah.
Now...
These creatures are quite, er, fascinating.
The, er...
Notice his armour, the spines, and the, erm... er, pseudopods.
Here.
They are...testing the water to find out if there is anything to eat and also to orientate the creature.
- You see, he's turning over.
- Yes, he's moving.
You put him in upside down.
He recognises that and is trying to get the right way up.
Yes!
Hey!
Mrs Durrells!
See?
What a heavenly place.
(Sighs) I could lie here forever.
Having food and wine pressed into my mouth by naked dryads.
Eventually, by breathing deeply and evenly...
I should embalm myself in this scent.
This heavenly scent.
Embalming is a...fascinating subject.
The, erm...
The Ancient Egyptians had it to a fine art.
(Laughs)
Ingenious the way they extracted the brain through the, er... nose.
- Sort of hook.
- Mm.
Up through the nostrils and, er...
(Smacks lips)
Dragging it down, yes.
Larry, dear, we are trying to eat.
And after that voyage...
- (Margo) We thought you were enjoying it.
- Well, I am now.
(Theodore) It certainly is a very, very...beautiful place.
(Mrs Durrell) It is.
A glorious place.
I should like to be buried here.
- (Squawks angrily)
- Ow!
Ow!
That's my ankle.
Blood!
(Squawks)
(Cicadas chirrup)
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.
- Oh, are you going?
- Yes.
Well, thank you for the fish.
- I do hope you haven't been bored.
- No, I'm never bored.
No.
Kosti's never bored.
That's very good.
Because you know what they say.
The devil makes...
Mother means to say she can see you're not an idle man.
Bye.
Goodbye.
(Kosti and Theodore speak Greek)
He seems such a nice man.
Not a bit like a murderer.
What do you expect?
Harelip?
Club foot?
Knife in one hand, a bottle marked "poison" in the other?
Don't be silly, dear.
But I thought he might have looked a bit more...
Well, you know...
Murderous.
Well, you shouldn't go on appearances.
I could have told you at once he was a murderer.
How?
Nobody but a murderer would have thought of giving Gerry that albatross.
Look, blood!
Mrs Durrell.
Gerry is going to have to go to school.
Yes, I know.
A real school.
Yes, he must receive a more, er... sensible education.
Isn't it sad?
Are you feeling awfully?
I am, Gerry.
You haven't had a good meal for days,
I would feel jolly unwell if I didn't eat.
You at least understand.
The others are louts.
Larry's an intelllectual lout and Leslie's just a lout.
I'm glad to see you're in the sunshine at last, it can't do you any good to moon about in your room.
I don't moon, I've got a broken heart, you silly little boy.
I fell in, trying to catch a crab with an ane-nome (anemone) on its back.
The interesting thing is, the crab put it there.
It does.
- It helps it catch things.
- Go away!
I liked Peter, pity he's gone.
Yes, you did.
I'm sorry.
But still go away.
I was going anyway!
I'm starving!
Oh, dear.
I almost thought a little food might pass her lips tonight.
She even nibbled at a piece of toast this morning
- I shall tear It up.
- Good idea.
Oh, no!
We've all agreed that letters are sacrosanct.
You tore up mine.
They were from Paris.
From my friends.
I don't approve of your friends in Paris.
And I apologised.
It was in fact an accident.
No, we must give It to her.
We could steam It open.
Thoroughly dishonest, mother.
I'm only doing It for Margo, I'd do the same for you.
- Please don't.
- You snatched those letters from me, that's how they were torn.
It could be delayed.
Oh, what a good idea, Leslie.
Just until we've got some food inside her.
- He is comings.
- What do you mean, Spiro?
I think so.
Mister Peters, he is coming to take her away.
I knows it.
I should not have broughts it.
I should have thrown myself off the cliff with it.
That's very kind of you, Spiro, but we do rely on you for mail.
If he is comings, I will get the boys onto him.
He will not be safe anywhere on the islands.
And If he shows his faces,
I will rubs him out.
But he is comings, mark my words.
I knows the heart.
(Speaks Greek)
It is, er...very Greek to have this passion, where the food cannot get to the belly
- and you throws.
- Look, look at the size of them!
Aren't they beautiful?
(Chirps)
Ooh!
Ohh!
You shouldn't show Spiro things like that, you know he's got a weak stomach.
I know and I am careful, but these are beautiful creatures, aren't they?
Yes, they are, dear, they're...
They're...they're lovely.
Aren't they, Larry?
- Leslie?
- Exquisite.
Er, pretty.
It's just that everyone doesn't see things in the same way that y...that we do.
And I've only just got Margo eating again.
Please, Gerry.
Poor Spiro.
- It's all right, Spiro.
- Uhh.
(Frogs chirp quietly)
(Sighs)
Ohh.
Gollys, Master Gerrys.
Why do you show me such things?
I'm sorry I rushes off, Mrs Durrells but honest the gods, when I see one of them bastards...
I just has to throws and I think is better that I throws outside than in heres.
Absolutely, Spiro.
They're the most horrible things I've ever seen.
- Yes, to be honest.
- Oh.
(Quiet chirping)
Please, don't ever show them things to me again, Master Gerrys.
- Please.
- (Chirping)
Excuse me.
(Chirping)
I hope you've washed your hands, Gerry.
Yes.
Where are they?
Safely under my bed.
I think aesthetically you are all limited.
Eh?
If you don't mind me saying so.
You might be right.
I'm starving.
Well, you wouldn't be, had you come down earlier.
- It won't have ruined Leslie's appetite.
- Lord, no.
Nothing can do that.
I'm glad to hear that you're hungry, Margo.
Spiro had to throws.
- Leslie.
- Just making conversation, mother.
Did he bring the mail?
Yes.
Would you mind waiting until we've eaten?
No, not at all.
As I said, I'm starving.
(Sobs quietly)
(Sobs)
Margo?
He's coming for me.
So there!
Best thing he could do.
What does she mean?
I think he intends to carry her off.
That is an excellent idea.
It is not, and you must stop saying such things, Larry.
She's a very young girl and she's your sister.
That's right.
We must mount a 24-hour guard.
- Thank you, Leslie.
- Don't rely on me.
Oh, no, look at her.
I don't want him to.
I've only just started to eat again.
Right, mother,
I shall kill two birds with one stone.
There's been a certain amount of petty pilfering.
I shall set a trap.
Hello, Geronimo, you're early tonight.
"Cecily, the praying mantis,
"devouring her mate, while they mate.
"He's still mating, though half-eaten."
(Chirruping)
Did you know she was eating him
- all of the time they were mating?
- Ha!
This'll get him.
Who?
Erm, Peter what's-his-name.
If he comes back for Margo.
And it'll stop that pilfering from the jetty.
First sound... bang.
I've got Spiro out on patrol, down there.
And he's got all his cousins watching the port.
Right.
Block your ears, Gerry.
(Loud bang)
(Music on wireless)
Cecily is pregant.
Don't look at me.
- Or me.
- Who's Cecily, dear?
My praying mantis, she's pregant.
Oh, that's nice.
Here comes Margo.
She seems to have recovered her appetite, so try to be good.
No mention of you-know-who or love or anything like that.
Good morning, Margo.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Have some toast, Margo.
Thank you.
My mantis is pregnant, Margo.
Any day now, eggs.
And do you know they eat their husbands while they are doing it.
I watched Cecily, she's my mantis.
And do you know, he didn't stop doing It all the time she was eating him.
First the head, then the thorax, munching away.
There, look what you've done.
(Sobs) I think that's the most tragic tale I've ever heard.
I don't think they regard It as tragic.
Animals can be quite...quite...
Insensitive?
No.
Matter-of-fact about food. (Slurps)

(Roger barks)
(Barking)
She's done something silly.
Poor girl.
- What?
- This family is driving me mad.
- This is the limit.
- You've shot him.
- Keep calm!
Keep calm!
It 's only burglars.
- Are you all right?
If you killed him I'll never speak to you again.
- I thought you'd done something silly.
- Don't be silly.
Animals and explosions all day and then 21-gun salutes during the night.
Can't you give us some warning?
I can't shoot burglars if I give warnings.
You ought to try, dear.
This was an accident,
I got my foot caught in something in my sleep.
Couldn't you ring a bell or something?
Roger!
(Quietens down)
Come on, Roger.
Geronimo.
- Geronimo?
- (Faint chirp)
Geronimo?
Oh, no, you haven't!
You have.
(Soft chirp)
(Sighs)
What a lovely day.
What a lovely, lovely, lovely day.
I wish I could just sail away for ever and a day on such a lovely day.
Ever and ever and ever and a day.
Aunt Mabel's moved to Sussex.
She says, "Henry has passed all his exams and is going into a...
"bank."
At least, I think it's a bank.
Her handwriting really is appalling.
Uncle Stephen has broken his leg, poor old thing.
And his bladder.
- Hmm?
- Well...
What?
Oh, no, no.
I think it's broken his leg, falling off a ladder.
It's ridiculous at his age being anywhere near a bladder...er, ladder.
She asks after you, Larry.
Mm.
Hopes you are well, Leslie.
- Hm?
- And Marg...where's Margo?
Larry, where's Margo?
- What?
- Margo, where is she?
I don't know.
She's all right, isn't she?
Got her own lovelorn nonsense.
Well, she's eating and she's coming out of her room.
Can strike at any time.
I don't think she's over it by a long chalk.
Mm.
- I'm very well.
- What?
Well, next time you write to Aunt Mabel, say yes.
Yes what, dear?
Yes, I'm very well.
Oh, yes, I see...
You can tell her yourself.
She's coming to stay.
- What?
- What?
I don't see how we can refuse.
She is a relative.
She's been advised by the doctors that she needs a warm climate.
Oh, come on, the world is littered with warm...very warm climates.
Why choose us?
Great-Aunt Hermione hasn't much longer to live.
I thought she'd died years ago.
Because you never listen when I read her letters.
That's right.
It's bad enough Aunt Mabel wanting to come.
She's bad enough.
At least she'll have to go back at some time.
Great-Aunt Hermione intends to die here.
Oh, come now, Larry, she could live for years yet.
Oh, no.
No, you're right.
"I'm sure, as you now seem to able to afford such a large establishment,
"you would not begrudge a small corner to an old woman...
"who's not much longer to live."
Well, what can we do?
(Larry) Smallpox.
I'll write and tell her we've got smallpox.
Oh, that's a good excuse.
In detail.
That's the secret of good letter-writing, always paint a good picture.
You know that, you're going to be a writer.
I am a writer, but I can't work if the villa is crammed with geriatrics come to die.
Well, I'm not joining in this.
But I will say... she sings hymns in the lavatory.
Rock of Ages.
And everyone has to queue.
I don't know why you keep in touch with the old hags.
They're either fossilised or mental, all of them.
My relatives are not mental.
Oh, they are.
Aunt Bertha keeps flocks of imaginary cats.
Great-Uncle Patrick goes about naked telling strangers he killed whales with a penknife.
Bats!
But they're not mental.
They are a...a little queer, some of them.
But not enought to be put away.
You'll probably be queer when you get to their age.
The thing to do is move.
Move?
Well, to a smaller villa.
But we've only just moved here in order to make room for your friends.
Well, now we have to move to cope with your relatives.
"No room, can't have you.
"Fallen on hard times, can't feed you."
A smaller villa.
Has somoebody moved the Bootle Bumtrinket?
No, dear.
Well, somebody must have!
It must be a very small villa, Spiro.
Yes, yes, Mr Larrys,
Mrs Durrells, but, er, you want bathrooms.
Well, of course.
But one bathrooms will do.
It won't.
Gerry fills the bath with wriggly things.
No, no, no, It must be more than one.
Larry, where did you say that Margo was?
(Speaks Greek)
Lugaretzia, have you seen Margo?
(Speaks Greek)
Margo?
Is in the sea.
Oh, my God, I'm sinking!
Ohh!
There she is!
(Leslie) This way, Margo!
- Margo!
- This way!
Help!
(Leslie) This way, Margo!
- You're going to Albania, Margo, this way.
- If she sinks the Bootle Bumtrinket,
I'll never speak to her again.
Help!
- Lift back!
- She'd be better to swim for it.
And leave my boat?
Margo, this way!
And row harder!
- I don't think she's going to make it.
- She jolly well better!
No!
No, Ma...
Margo!
Oh, look, someone'll have to go in after her.
- Spiro?
- Yes!
I can't swims.
You built the blasted thing, you go and get her!
All right.
(Margo) Help me!
I'm sinking!
(Weeps)
(Sobbing) Larry, I tried to row it.
(Screams)
(Larry) It's all right.
(Sobbing) Let me get out!
What have you done to my boat?
It wasn't me.
The stupid boat hit the rocks!
Really Margo, I sometimes wonder if you're quite mad.
You do the most silly things!
(Wails) Oh, Mummy, it could have happened to anyone.
I'll tell you one thing.
I'm cured of love.
That's all very well and good, cured of love!
But what about my boat?
What's it cured of?
Nothing!
Nothing at all!
If that's curing love, someone should say sorry!
(Buzzing)
(Spiro) Is best if I tell you what you can buy.
You don't understand.
You're not in Bournemouth any mores.
- Here, they are all thieves.
(Leslie) Then how do they makes a living?
- Come on.
- (Spiro) No.
No, wait.
(Leslie) Come on, Margo.
(Larry) Come on, Ma.
I'll take those.
- Oh.
Thank you, darling.
- Just a minute.
- Er, now.
I think we'd better... (Chatter)
Come now, Spiro, not everyone can be a thief.
I mean, that old lady can't be a thief.
That old lady is my mothers.
Er, no.
No, no.
She is not my mothers like your mothers is your mothers.
But she is my mothers.
Oh, how nice.
Eggplants.
- Look, Margo.
- No.
Do not buys them.
I buys them for you.
(Whines)
(Gerry) I have tried.
All last night.
Really I have, George.
Well, then.
Maybe we should go back to ordinary division.
Or another problem.
- Something else?
- I suppose so.
(Scrabbling)
What is that noise?
I think it must be Achilles.
(George) Yes.
I think it must be.
He must be caught, I expect.
Look.
He's stuck.
Can you help lift it?
I'm not used to lifting furniture.
And I might add that I've never worked for Carter Paterson and, therefore, have no understanding of the techniques of furniture shifting.
Well, somebody's got to do it or he'll die or something.
Yes.
Oh, all right.
(Struggling) Come on, then.
(George grunts)
Thank you.
- What did you say he was called?
- Achilles.
I got him from the Rosebeetle Man.
(♪ Folk tune)
(Cock crows in distance)
(George) Achilles.
So you know about the Greek hero Achilles, at least.
Well, that's a start then, isn't it?
Let's forget about sums and look at ancient Greece.
(Engine rattles in distance)
- Oh, all right.
Off you go.
- (Muffled voices)
Take him with you.
You should haves a servant.
You shoulds not have to work like this.
- You should haves the cooks.
- Cooks?
- Yes, the cooks.
Plain cooks.
- My very words.
- You pay too much for this guitar.
- I thought it was very reasonable.
Mrs Durrells, you asks him how much he pays for this guitar.
- It is a beautiful guitar.
- No, no, no, no, no.
Next time, you must promise me, Mrs Durrells, that nobody buys anythings.
They are all thieves.
I knows him with the guitars.
He's my brothers and he thiefs you.
I've, er, let Gerry go.
Yeah.
We saw him run off.
I can't seem to get through to him.
- Hello, George.
- Margo.
- (Mrs Durrell) I'm sure you'll find a way.
- A way?
With Gerry.
Oh, yes.
Yes, I'm sure.
(Cicadas chirrup)
He must be educates, Sir George.
He musts.
Like-a me.
But he's such a friendly little chap, Spiro.
It seems such a shame.
If you don'ts do it, I, Spiro Agiapoulos, will do it.
Readings, writings and arithmetic.
Have you been to a fiesta?
(Buzzes)
I know.
I know.
You're doing an aeroplane.
It's a very good aeroplane.
I'm honoured.
Thank you.
The tortoise is well.
No, no.
I bought a tortoise from you.
I've called it Achilles.
Remember?
I would like a bird.
A pigeon.
A bird.
How much for a pigeon?
(Clicks fingers)
(Tweeting)
I am sorry, but I have no money.
Would you be so kind as to call to the villa so I could pay you then?
Thank you.
(Tweeting)
Looks revolting.
It's only a baby.
I have to feed it.
It can't feed itself.
Oh.
What on earth is that?
A pigeon.
My new pet.
- What do you think I should call it?
- What?
Yuck.
It's quite a good name but Quasimodo'd be better.
Yes.
That's very good.
Why?
- Well, it seems like a nice name.
- Was he another Greek hero?
Not quite.
Ask George when you're rambling through literature.
He'll know.
Don't tease, Larry.
Poor little pigeon.
Doesn't look a bit like nasty Lon Chaney.
Pigeons all look the same in a pie.
Huh.
Ha.
Ha.
Morning, Gerald.
The disciple awaits the master, agog with anticipation, I trust?
- What on earth is that?
- He's called Quasimodo.
A very interesting name.
Do you know how to spell it?
- No.
- Well, that's a start for this morning then.
- Ow.
- (Gerry) It's only Achilles.
He wants a strawberry.
Give him a strawberry.
- His paws are so sharp.
- (Gerry) I don't think they're called paws.
- What are they called, George?
- Oh, I don't know.
It's a reptile.
- Claws?
- (Cock crows)
(♪ Brass band march)
(Gerry) If you go on watching him, he'll come back.
He likes people and strawberries.
(George) Does he?
Quasimodo,
Q-U-A-S-l-M-O-D-O, was a hunchback.
And hopelessly in love.
Oh.
(♪ Gramophone music continues)
Ah, yes.
Practise.
One must always, always practise.
Uh.
(♪ Gramophone:
Viennese waltz)
(♪ Hums along)
(Margo screams)
(George) Your sister's gone for a swim, chased away by a tortoise.
Well, let's try something else, shall we?
If it takes three men a week to build a wall, how long will it... (Whispers) No.
Gerry, if it takes two caterpillars a week to eat eight leaves, how long will it take four caterpillars to eat the same number?
I expect you'll want to draw your caterpillars first, won't you?
(Sighs)
Tomorrow, I'll bring a towel.
It's a sea cucumber.
(Dog barks)
Have you seen Achilles?
No.
No, I haven't.
Not for days.
- How are you enjoying your lessons?
- Oh, all right.
History?
What are you learning?
- Oh, everything.
- Good.
- Such as?
- Hannibal.
- Oh, that's nice.
- Elephants, you see.
- Really?
- He crossed the Alps with them.
I must say, there were rather a lot in India.
I know all their names.
And they had a man specially to look after them.
Not only provender but also, and this was of vital importance for the Alps are very cold, to make sure their hot-water bottles were always filled up.
- (Laughs)
- So, that's history, isn't it?
Oh. (Speaks Greek)
Oh, dear.
Something must be done about those poor beetles.
Achilles.
(Larry) Achilles.
(Margo) Achilles.
(Gerry) Achilles.
- Achilles.
- Master Gerrys.
Spiro, we're looking for Achilles.
Never minds that.
You tells me how many fingers I have.
How manys?
Oh, Spiro, don't be so silly.
Is not silly.
Is not.
You must be educate.
Your mother will not be happy unless you ares.
Achilles.
(Larry) Achilles.
(Margo) Achilles.
(Sighs) OK.
Achilles!
Perhaps he's gone back to his family.
India produces what, Gerald?
Tigers and rice.
And Australia?
Kangaroos... and sheep.
Quasimodo!
(George) And the first thing Columbus said when he set foot on American soil was,
"Look, a jaguar."
That was in 1492.
(Cicadas chirruping)
(Flapping, squawking)
Hello, you revolting creature.
Have you come for some music?
Come here, come here, come here.
That's it.
That's it.
(Quasimodo gobbles)
There.
(♪ Viennese waltz)
(Gobbling)
(Laughing)
(Record ends)
(Gobbling)
He's incredible.
He really loves music.
Well, he's a musical pigeon.
He sits on my face in the night.
I don't think that's a good idea.
- Cruel to pigeons, you mean?
- (Margo) You pig.
- Might help her spots.
- (Gerry laughs)
Mother, be careful about what you buy next.
Those rose beetles are all over the house.
But darling, we couldn't let them stay tied to that man's hat.
(Gerry) Achilles, Achilles, where are you?
Morning, Gerry.
I think that's how it sounded outside Troy.
- Is he learning anything?
- I don't know.
I try my best.
But it gets very difficult to turn everything to animals.
It's the only way he'll listen, though.
Well, I'm going to the beach.
Good idea.
Start the day with a swim.
(Larry laughs)
I'm not a teacher, Larry, I'm a writer.
So, the French and the British fleets were slowly drawing together for what was to be the decisive battle of the war.
- Date?
- 1805.
Yes.
Well...
Nelson was already on the deck, bird-watching.
- What birds?
- What birds?
What birds did Nelson see?
You've beaten me.
(Gerry sighs)
(Gasps, yelps) Oh, Gerald.
(Roger barks)
Oh, dear.
Achilles?
Do you mind if I try something, Gerry?
Don't think it'd do any good.
Trouble is, you can't feel you're getting anywhere with such a thick shell.
Artificial respiration is supposed to move the body.
Poor Achilles.
Why don't we force strawberries down his throat?
- That won't do any good.
- (Margo) Give him something to live for.
(Leslie) Show him what he's missing.
- Where did you find him?
- Just there, by the well.
Where will he be buried?
I think he'd like to lie under a strawberry plant, don't you?
Awfully good for the strawberries.
Yes.
I think he'd like that.
When will the ceremony take place?
(Larry) I'll write something.
Thank you, Larry.
Which of us...
Achilles, proud Achilles, a friend to us all.
Which of us has not felt the tug of his friendship?
Which of us has not wished he would stay in his tent when we're sunbathing?
But now, he will no longer come from the sweet william to plague us.
Do we not miss him?
Indeed we do.
Proud Achilles, our tortoise who loved people.
At least he's spared the indignity of becoming spectacles.
Rest in peace under the strawberries, Achilles.
Quasimodo has arisen.
Sir George, is no goods.
- We got to talks.
- I beg your pardon?
(Sighs) This is most ghastly.
I don't like to say these things but it is for everybody's goods.
- You say you spoke to George?
- Yes, yes.
He, he has no letters.
- Oh, that's, that's very sad.
- Mm.
A teacher must have letters.
What, not even a postcard?
(Sewing machine rattles)
A postcard?
I think that's very sad.
(Quietly) Could you...?
If you could hold it there.
Pull quite hard.
No.
No, er...
After his names.
No letters.
Er...
This and that he has been doctors of, or professors of.
Oh, yes.
Now I understand.
Yes.
Yes.
Licences.
(Spiro laughs)
And, er, diploomas.
A teacher must have diploomas or he knows nothings.
(Gerry and companion chatting)
I give up.
Well, it's all very well and good and I like being here and going down for a swim with Gerry and Margo and all that sort of thing.
But I have run out of ways to make him learn anything.
- Has he beaten you?
- No.
He just needs a proper tutor.
A more patient man than I.
Yes, well, maybe you're right.
Sir George.
- Larry.
- Goodbye, George.
Oh, George.
Oh, yes.
- Gerry.
- (Buzzing)
Gerald, I think you'd better fetch the Rosebeetle Man.
(Muted) The rose beetles are all over the house.
Please come.
Please.
I have no money.
I have no money.
Please.
- Larry, have you got the fruit?
- Well, what do you think?
- Of what?
- You know perfectly well what, Larry.
It's lovely.
What is it?
Oh, I know what it is.
I think you'll probably drown.
It'll get waterlogged and drag you down with it.
- It's not.
- It can't be.
- (Larry) It looks like a badly skinned whale.
- You can't wear it, not to swim in.
I certainly can.
And don't be so rude or I shall forbid you all to go.
- (Roger barks) - (Gerry) Mother, don't flap it about like that.
I don't care what you say, I am determined to wear it.
(All laughing)
(Roger barks)
(Laughing) What you look like, Mother, is a sort of marine Albert Memorial.
- (Leslie laughs)
- Come on, Mother.
Come on.
- Looks cold.
- It isn't cold.
Oh, it is cold.
It is...
Oh.
Ro...
Roger!
- Gerry, stop him.
- (Ripping)
(Laughter)
(Roger growls.
Yelps.)
Gerry, do something.
Roger.
He's doing his best to rescue you from that dead whale you're wrapped in.
- Good boy, Roger.
- (Laughter)
Oh, Roger.
(Panting)
Oh, look.
Look what he's done.
We can't blame the dog, Mother.
You do look like a sea monster.
Well done, Roger.
We could have been attacked from the sea.
(Growling)
(All laughing)
Picnics remind me of camping.
(Larry) You've never been camping in your life.
Oh, yes, I have.
With your father.
- When?
- In India.
(Leslie) First I heard of it.
We often used to go camping, sometimes miles and miles into the jungle.
It was quite dangerous.
- What, just the two of you?
- Course.
- Well, I'm blown.
- Oh, it was very exciting.
First of all, the elephants would go off with the marquees and carpets, then the servants would follow with the silver, the linen, the beds and things.
- Call that camping?
- Oh, it was.
I'll have you know that on one occasion, an elephant went astray.
Your father didn't have any clean sheets for three days.
He was furious.
My God, that was really roughing it.
Roger, sit down and listen or you won't hear anything.
Everybody on the whole of the island of Corfu is snoring except you and me, Roger, and the sea and the fishes in the sea and the cicadas.
(Whines)
- Swim.
- (Barks)
Yeah!
- Roger, come on.
- (Barks)
They're blennies, Roger.
Come on, Roger.
I'm thirsty.
(Roger barks)
(Snoring)
(Snoring)
Ah, Yani's asleep.
Perhaps if we make enough noise, Roger, we can wake him up.
I know what we can do to wake him up, don't you?
(Roger yelps)
(Clucking, squawking)
(Bleating, barking)
Good afternoon.
I hope you slept well.
Good afternoon, little lord.
I heard a noise.
There was a noise.
How is your health?
My health is excellent.
Your health?
It is likewise.
It is a very hot afternoon.
This afternoon is hot enough to melt a bottle.
Sit.
You will honour me by sitting and eating and drinking with me.
Little lord, you are always on your stomach, whenever I come upon you in the hills, in the grass, wherever.
You are on your stomach, looking at the creatures.
Please, sit.
Aphrodite!
Aphrodite... (Speaks Greek)
(Aphrodite replies)
She slept.
(Speaks Greek)
It was too hot.
Fruit and drink for the little lord.
Under a rock this morning, curved like the sword of a Turk, surrounded with its own poison.
- He was full.
- Dead?
Of course dead.
Drowned in the oil.
That one was a killer.
Observe the quantity of poison.
(Cock crows)
(Yani grunts)
- That one was a fighter.
- Why?
You ask why, little lord, I tell you why.
You, who are interested in all the little crawling and scurrying little ones of God, you should know because, one day, when you are on your stomach, observing, some devil such as this one,
perhaps his brother will take it into his head to sting you, that is why.
Yes?
It may never happen.
It has never happened to me.
- But should it...
- Will I die?
- Undoubtedly.
- In agony?
Undoubtedly.
In your ear.
You are so close to the ground, it will enter your ear.
I knew a young man.
He had drunk new wine, his stomach was warm with it.
He sniffed the sleep in the air.
He looked for shade.
He found it under myrtles.
But while he slept, a scorpion crept into his ear.
And when he woke, it struck.
(Girl laughing)
What happened?
First of all, madness.
Then death.
No one heard his agonies.
Just one little bite, little lord.
- You may have that.
- Thank you.
Why?
If ever you are bitten.
It is why I never sleep except in a chair.
This oil, rub it on if you are bitten.
(Cock crows)
Nice?
(Speaks Greek)
Look.
Roger.
(Roger yelps)
It's a trap door.
A little trap door.
Do you think anything lives there?
A wasps' nest, perhaps?
Something like that?
Nothing at home.
(Scratching)
Stop that, Roger.
- Roger.
- (Roger whines)
Come on.
Home.
(Barking)
(Gerry) I found something rather intriguing.
- Oh, that's nice, dear.
- Is it to do with fish, flesh or fowl?
- Darling...
- Insects, I suppose.
- ..this is Dr Stephanides.
- Theodore.
- He, too, is an eccentric lover of nature.
- (Laughs)
He, too, spends a lot of time on his stomach, peering at things.
How do you do?
You must be Gerry.
I am.
I'm sure they must be nests.
You are?
Round trap doors, which open in the moss.
Trap-door spider.
How wonderful.
Perhaps we could verify it if it is not too far away.
Don't let him drag you all over the island.
(Sighs) I must get on.
I must cook something.
Gerry has no conception of distance.
Spiro can take you.
Where is Spiro?
- No.
We would rather walk.
- Yes, we would.
Spiro's been behaving very strangely lately.
Yes.
I saw him lurking today.
I mean, there is no other word for it.
He was lurking.
- We'll send him after you.
- Yes.
Don't let him drink any of your wine.
Now then, Gerry.
(Sighs) I can't sit here.
You know, I've never bought wine by the barrel before.
It's very economical.
Yes, isn't it?
I expect it will last for ever.
(Mrs Durrell sings) ♪ La la di di di ♪
(Cicadas chirrup)
It's up there.
Ah.
Yes.
- Huh.
- Is it one?
Erm, yes.
Yes.
Cteniza.
You have discovered the burrows of the trap-door spider.
One has to take great care.
The female holds on to the trap door with her legs and one must take great care...
Not her legs, rather, her claws.
These are, of course, as you know, the burrows of the female spider.
The burrows of the male, as I said, as you know...
- No.
- Oh.
Doctor, I don't know.
Oh...
Theodore, or, Theo, among colleagues.
No, of course you don't know, didn't know.
You do know now?
(Laughs)
The burrows of the male are smaller.
So, a grasshopper making its way across, or any small insect, prey, the female pops out of her hole and, er, catches the creature.
If you look carefully, you should find others.
They live in colonies.
Ah, now.

Oh, darling, I do draw the line at scorpions in the house.
- Is it dead?
- Of course it's dead.
Larry, you eat too much.
It's bad for you.
(Mumbles)
It's all your fault.
I've seen the most marvellous spiders.
As you know, the trap-door spider lives in these wonderful burrows.
- Excuse me, dear.
- Mrs Durrells, how bitters it is for me to say this.
- Spiro, I've been waiting for this.
- I've been forgetting things
- because of the tragedies is happenings.
- Well, it's not good enough.
No.
I have important pronouncements to make.
What is it, Spiro?
Is terribles.
Horribles and terrible.
Yes, but what is it?
I...
Nothing.
Is nothing.
(Spiro laughs)
OK.
OK.
Goodbye.
Oh, dear.
I do hope Spiro isn't in love with you as well, Margo, like all those other Greek chaps.
How does the female spider not know when it is the male spider coming over the moss and pop out of its trap door to devour it?
That is the problem.
There.
That's everything in.
Mother.
Is it wise to just throw everything into the pot?
Good gracious no, dear.
No, you've gotta know what you're doing.
- But Mother, you've...
- Spiro's been behaving very oddly lately, popping up in the oddest places.
- Why have you been in the oddest places?
- (Laughing)
I don't know what you mean.
Larry.
Are you feeling all right?
No, I think I've got a bit of indigestion.
Are you sure it's indigestion?
You know, I think Margo's in love.
Well, I hope it's with someone who can tango.
(Larry laughs)
(♪ Gramophone:

I hope you can't die of eating scorpion poison.

I'm sorrys to tell you these horrible things, Mrs Durrells, but I wait until she goes into the house before I tells you.
I thinks you oughts to knows.
- What is the matter now, Spiro?
- Oh, please, Spiro, don't tell us.
- It's Missy Margo.
- There, there.
What did I tell you?
- He is in love with Spotty.
- (Laughs)
Young mans, is no laughing matter.
Mrs Durrells, did you knows that she's meeting a mans?
Yes.
A man?
Didn't we, boys?
- Yes.
- Well, it's news to me.
- Meetings, I mean.
- Yes, meetings.
Meetings hims.
Oh, yes.
- Yes.
- Yes.
We...we know that.
Did you knows...
- he's a Turk?
- Yes.
Er, no.
- A Turk?
- Oh, we knew that.
You knows that?
Well, no, we didn't.
But what is wrong with being a Turk?
Mrs Durrells, he's a Turk.
A real Turk.
I wouldn't trust any son of a bitch Turk with any girls.

He'll cut her throats, that's what he'll do.
Honest to Gods, Mrs Durrells, is not safe.
Missy Margo swimmings with hims.

Well, I'll speak to her about it.
I'm glads I tells you.
I thought you oughts to know.
Don't you worry, Mrs Durrells, if he did anything to Missy Margo,
Spiro Americano from Chicago fixes the bastard.
- Perhaps we ought to invite him to tea.
- (Laughter)
It's from Theodore.
Dr Stephanides.
- He's a real scientist, you know.
- When did it arrive?
Spiro brought it with the post.
Erm, he says, "Not very high magnification but you will find it sufficient for field work."
It's a microscope.
A real microscope.
(Quietly) Oh, God.
I feel awful.
- I've got a fever.
- A hangover.
You don't shiver with a hangover.
(Sighs) I'm going to bed.
- Come on, Larry, I think you've had enough.
- Too much food.
Too much wine.
- Are you sure?
- Not enough exercise, that's his trouble.
- Where's Mother?
- Outside in the garden, I think.
(Roger yelps)
- Gerry?
- Mother?
- Are you there, dear?
- Yes.
- (Loudly) Can you hear me?
- Yes.
Oh, good.
Because I want you to know that more than anywhere else, I want to be buried here, among the bose rushes.
No.
I mean the rose bushes.
- Oh.
That's good.
- Isn't it, dear?
Yes.
Much better than all those other places you've chosen.
I mean, not so far to go.
No.
Mother?
Larry's not feeling well.
Really?
You see, I don't know where he wants to be buried.
Mother, Larry's on fire.
(Roger barks)
Larry's on fire!
Oh, quick.
Save him.
Larry?
Oh, good heavens.
No wonder he's...
Look at that fire.
He said he was cold, so I put more wood on.
- Wake up.
For heaven's sake, wake up.
- What's the matter?
- (Mrs Durrell) The room's on fire.
- Well, get Leslie to just put it out.
Well, throw something on it.
Oh.
Water, you fool, not brandy.
- What the hell's going on?
- (Mrs Durrell) The room's on fire, dear.
Well, there's no reason for me to freeze to death.
Mother, go and get some water with Margo.
Gerry, open a window.
(Sighs) That's right.
There, there.
All done without any fuss.
Now, will someone go and get me a cup of tea?
I've got a splitting headache.
- Larry, you really are as tiddled as an owl.
- Absolutely.
Nonsense.
If it wasn't for me, you'd all be burnt in your beds.
(Snoring)
- There it is.
- The oranges just to the side?
That's lovely.
Is very small.
This is the front.
Come on, come on!
It is too smalls.
That's the whole point, Spiro!
Yes, but your friends, Mr Larrys.
- I have no friends.
- (Margo) I can see the sea!
In Corfu, the sea can be seen everywheres.
No, no, no, no!
It is too smalls.
Oh, It is small, Spiro.
I knows.
For all your friends, it is too smalls.
That's the whole point, Spiro!
No friends, no Great-Aunt Hermione.
I suppose so.
Are we going to have it?
I think it's wonderful.
There's lots of geckos and mantids, and in my room there's a bat.
(Margo screams)
That's my room, Margo!
You don't like bats!
He's mostly English, dear, although he's called Mr Kralefsky, isn't he, Spiro?
Yes.
He is very English mans.
- And he lives with birds.
- Oh, yes, he knows all about birds, Gerry.
I've heard that one.
They don't know the difference between a black redstart and a normal one.
Things like that, simple things.
Oh, I'm sure that Mr Kralefsky knows all about, er...red blackbirds.
He's a very nice man.
I expect he used to keep a canary or something.
Yes, canaries, everythings.
Mm.
And the bat has gone from my room.
Oh, that's nice.
Well, off you go, dear.
The sooner you start, the sooner you finish.
Yes, Master Gerrys, you must be educate.
- You must.
- (Sighs)
No, no, no, no.
Come on, come on.
(Spiro) ♪ Not thin, and yet not too much meat-a
♪ I'll woo her a while with my Argentine style
♪ And sweep her right off of her feet-a ♪
What's the matter?
Why don't you sing?
I don't know why this person can't come to the villa to educate me.
Oh, no!
Because, if he does, you will make him play with, er...bugs and horrible animals, and you will not be learned anythings.
You must be learned everything.
And they all loves your sister, which must be stopped, for the sake of your mother, who is a saint.

Education, Gerald.
One can not overestimate the importance of education.
Well, now, yes, let me see...
Ah, yes, counties.
How many counties are there in England?
Um, I don't know.
You don't know?
Well, say them after me.
Yorkshire, Lancashire, Derbyshire,
Shropshire, Warwickshire, Oxfordshire,
Buckinghamshire, Gloucestershire.
Yorkshire, Lancashire, Derbyshire,
- Shropshire.
- Shropshire.
- Warwickshire.
- Warwickshire, Oxfordshire,
Buckinghamshire, Gloucestershire.
Ah.
Good.
(Bell tinkling)
Oh, er...
Excuse me, I must go and see to Mother.
And he keeps wanting to go to the lavatory.
Gerald!
He doesn't say, "I want to go to the lavatory,"
he says he must go and see his mother.
Well, that's very nice, dear.
But what are you learning?
Oh, lots.
The county town of Warwickshire is Warwick.
The county town of Oxfordshire is Oxford.
The county town of Yorkshire is York.
Somerset.
- Somerset?
- The county town of Somerset.
Um...
Oh, Gerald!
Taunton is the county town of Somerset.
Now, tell me, what is produced in Essex?
Stainless steel?
Stainless steel...
Oh.
Somerset?
Coal.
- Oxfordshire?
- Coal?
Oh.
Yorkshire.
Coal.
Yes, yes.
Some coal.
Now, arithmetic.
(Car horn)
Spiro.
By Jove, by Jove, by Jove.
12:30 already.
The end of another scholastic day.
Well, off you go.
I have to collect some groundsel, for the birds.
- (Gerry) What sort of birds?
- All kinds of birds.
He's crazy about birds.
- Where does he keep them?
- He lives with them in their houses.
Oh, stuffed.
He must be crazy, collecting groundsel for stuffed birds.
Yes, he is crazy.
Only, aren't you as crazy?
You have parrots in your house.
You have owls and horrible toadies, and he has beautiful birds.
And he is a very clever mans, and he will learned you everythings if only you will listens!
(Larry) Not more animals!
- Look!
- (Larry) Revolting!
(Margo) Oh, I think they're sweet!
What are they?
(Spiro) Gollys, Master Gerrys, what's thems?
They are, as a matter of fact, magpies.
They'll be very simple to feed.
They're very pretty, really.
- I hope they're old enough to eat, dear.
- Oh, Mrs Durrells, you can't eats thems!
- (Chuckles) - (Larry) They'll steal everything.
(Leslie) I shall probably shoot them by mistake, and that'lll cause a ruction!
(Spiro) Honest to gods!
The things that Master Gerrys finds!
Nothing will be safe.
Everything will vanish.
- Well, that's jackdaws, isn't it?
- No, no, magpies as well.
Look.
- See?
They want the money.
- Nonsense, dear!
They're hungry.
They've got criminal tendencies.
They're thieves.
An animal that wants money, a horrible thought.
You can't have them in the house.
You'll have to put them back.
I couldn't, they'd die.
Their mother would desert them and they'd starve.
Poor little things.
I think they're very sweet.
Don't take any notice, he's lying.
He just knows how to get round you.
It wouldn't do any harm to keep them.
They'll starve.
- (Larry) They won't starve!
- Best to wring their necks now, before they become a nuisance.
Right.
They'll steal from every room.
We'll have to bury all our valuables.
Unless we put an armed guard around them.
It's lunacy!
- Look at them!
Look at them!
- Horribles little bastards!
They're not bastards, Spiro, they're magpies.
All they want is a name.
- What do you calls thems?
- Magpies, Spiro.
Little magpies.
Maggenpies?
Maggenpies, eh... (Margo) No, magpies, Spiro.
That's what I says, maggenpies.
Oh!
Maggenpies!
William I, William II, Henry I, Stephen, Henry II.
William I, William II, Henry I, Stephen, Henry II.
Yes?
- Henry III?
- No.
Richard I.
Surnamed Coeur de Lion.
Why are you a fidget?
I had a lot of loquats for breakfast, and I would like to... pay a visit to...your mother.
I beg your pardon?
I have to!
But, er, perhaps first I'd better see if it's convenient, erm...
Er, tidy.
It doesn't matter.
Ours is often in a mess.
Oh, I'm sure she'll be delighted to meet you, but, please, do let me go in first.
- Of course.
- Just a moment.
Mother will be delighted to meet you.
Mother.
Here's Gerry, come to see you.
Aren't I a bore?
Aren't old people bores?
I'm flattered you asked to see me.
I thought...
Do sit down and talk for a minute.
It's so soft!
Silky...
My one remaining vanity.
All that's left of my beauty.
How beautiful things fall in love with themselves, don't they?
They feed on it, on themselves.
The more beautiful they are, the stronger they become.
That's what's happened to my hair.
It'll probably grow for ever, deep-packed in my coffin, rooted in my dust.
Mother, you mustn't talk thus.
I don't like to hear such morbid thoughts.
It's not morbid, is it, Gerry?
Not at all morbid.
Besides, think what a wonderful shroud... (Bell tinkles)
By Jove, by Jove, by Jove!
Eggs.
Well, run along, run along.
Gerry and I will chat until you come back.
Don't worry about us.
That's the ticket!
My son...
He teaches you...well?
- Sort of.
- He knows a great deal.
- Yes.
- Has he found your friendship?
He does make me repeat everything.
Yes...
Do you have an interest in birds?
Natural things?
- Flowers?
- Oh, yes!
Right.
You must ask him to let you meet some of his beautiful birds.
- Do you think I'm old?
- Oh, yes.
- Very old.
- I am.
I am very old!
They say that...when you grow old, your body slows down.
It does not.
Life slows down for you.
Extraordinary things you would never suspect happen all around you.
Flowers talk!
- Have you heard them?
- No!
When you get to my age you will.
That is, if you retain an open mind.
- What do they say?
- Ah...
I don't know.
I'm too old to start learning another language.
Well, It can't be learnt.
It can only become known.
People say that when you grow old, you believe less and are surprised at nothing, so you are more receptive to ideas.
Nonsense!
All the old people I know have their minds locked up like grey, scaly oysters.
You think I'm loopy, don't you?
Babbling on about flowers talking.
Look at that rose.
Isn't he wonderful?
He's been with me now for two weeks, fully open.
He was so sick when he first arrived.
I feared for his life.
He was put with daisies!
Fatal!
Absolutely fatal!
The daisy family is so cruel, so... working-class.
All right in their own way, but rough and ready, down to earth, a spade's a spade.
And to put an aristocrat among them!
Oh!
It never works.
He drooped and faded so much I didn't even see him among them.
He was being harried to death by Michaelmas daisies.
And then...
I heard the merest bleat of another voice.
A much more cultured voice.
And there I found him, crushed amongst them, fading fast.
Look at him now.
Taken from the daisies, half an aspirin, and he's thanking me by remaining beautiful for as long as he can.
Just like people.
(Door opens)
They've hatched.
The whole clutch.
Good!
I am so glad.
Gerry and I have been talking about the most interesting things.
At least, I thought they were interesting.
So did I. Thank you.
- You must come again.
- I will If I may.
Would you like to see my birds?
I would be most interested.
Well, goodbye.
(Gerry) Goodbye.
Goodbye.
(Mother chuckles)
When you asked to see Mother, I thought you and I might become friends.
It is important, if I'm to teach you anything, isn't it?
- Yes.
- Friends.
That's the ticket!
First, before we go and see the birds, might I go to the lavatory?
Of course.
(Birds twittering)
Come in.
Come in.
Here I am, my little beauties.
Here I am.
I haven't forgotten you.
Oh, no.
Here we are.
This is for you.
There.
No, no, no!
Don't do that, not in your nice clean water.
Now, let me see...
There we are.
Now, my little beauties, it's your turn, it's your turn.
There we are.
At first I thought they were all canaries.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Bullfinches, goldfinches, serins, zebra finches.
All kinds.
Now, the water goes into there.
Very carefully.
That's excell...
Excellent.
Yes.
Here you are, my dears.
Here you are, my dears.
Now, you will not be forgotten.
You will not be...
Oh, dear.
Dear, dear.
No, no, you must do better.
Only two, my dear, only two.
One can hardly call that a clutch, with the best will in the world.
Oh, dear, dear.
Most disappointing.
Come.
There's more.
Oh, they're in fine fettle today.
It's the sunshine, you know.
Once the sun gets to the side of the house, they start to sing.
Don't you?
Beautiful.
I've got some magpies.
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
Maggie!
Well done.
(Squawks)
Good boy, Maggie!
There, in Hyde Park, with her back to a tree, was a lady.
Her skirts were torn, her legs were bitten and bloody.
With a deckchair, she was fending off a ravening bull terrier.
Her strength was ebbing.
I was the only gentleman in sight.
There was not a moment to be lost.
I bounded forward and struck the brute with my walking stick.
The stick broke.
The animal contemplated my throat.
(Sighs)
"Aimer", the verb "to love".
The verb "to love"?
J'aime, tu aimes, il aime, elle aime, nous aimons, vous aimez, ils aiment, elles aiment.
And then, though he was armed with only a knife, he killed six of the ruffians, with his knife he concealed in his mosquito boot.
And thus the lady was rescued, thus.
How brave.
Only what a gentleman would do for a lady.
Yes, very brave.
(Larry) Kill those bastard magpies!
Oh, no.
They only seem interested in Larry's room.
(Magpie squawking)
Out you go!
Go on, out you go!
Out you go!
Out you go!
That's the last straw!
They're naturally curious.
All members of the crow family are.
- If you don't do something about it, I will...
- Anything missing?
I don't see how you can do anything in this mess.
- I think it was the maggenpies.
- They made an awful mess of your papers.
- They didn't know they were doing wrong.
- They're only birds.
If you don't lock them up, I will tear them wing from wing!
- That isn't fair!
- Larry doesn't mean it.
Naturally he's upset.
They have made an awful mess.
Upset?
I'm furious!
They descended like scab-ridden critics, bespattered and tore my work into pieces, fouled it, destroyed it before it's even finished!
- They've only just started flying.
- Yes.
It's disgusting, the way this family carries on about animals.
- They don't understand!
- Anthropomorphic slush drooling out again.
If something isn't done about them I'll use one of Leslie's guns and deal with them!
I'll get them and explain It to them.
You'll get them and lock them up!
Say, "Spiro".
Spiro!
Spiro.
I'm glad somebody's done something about the scab-ridden vultures.
A simple cage.
Gerry has made a first-class job of it.
Tell Mother about your fight with the French wrestling champion.
What?
Oh, no, no, no, one does not boast about such things.
- All right.
- To do with a lady of my acquaintance.
Oh.
How very nice.
(Gerry) As long as you show me a few tricks.
Tricks?
Mm.
Wrestling tricks.
Oh.
Er...very well.
Now.
Oh.
- Oh, very well.
- How exciting!
Yes.
Well, the secret is to get one's opponent off his balance.
It can be done...thus.
Uh, ohhh, ah!
Ah!
Huh!
- You see?
- Yes.
Wonderful!
- Have you got the idea?
- Yes.
That's the ticket!
Now, you try to throw me.
Yaaaah!
Aaaargh!
- Oh!
- Oh!
Oh!
God... (Kralefsky groaning)
Oh, dear!
I'll go and get the brandy!
I'm so sorry.
Gerry, dear, that was very careless!
I'm afraid he doesn't know his own strength.
Oh, no, please, please, do not blame the boy.
It was not his fault.
You see, I'm a little out of practice.
(Kralefsky) Oh, dear.
Oh, dear...
(Speaks Greek quietly)
Kalimera, Mrs Durrell.
Kalimera, Lugaretzia.
Thank you.
(Shutter creaks)
(Lugaretzia sighs)
(Speaks Greek)
Am feeling sick.
(Speaks Greek)
Kalimera, Mr Lawrence.
- How are you?
- (Speaks Greek)
Foolish of me to ask, I suppose.
Good morning, Lugaretzia.
Good morning, little lord.
Here is your tea.
(Speaks Greek)
I would recommend bicarbonate of soda.
Soda?
(Speaks Greek)
- Come on, Roger.
- (Roger barks)
(Gunshot)
Is that one of them?
(Larry) Who do you mean?
Has he come to stay?
Course he's come to stay.
I've invited him.
(Italian accent) I have come to you!
- (Laughing)
- Oh, it's wonderful to see you.
(Both laughing)
(Distant gunshot)
What a wonderful villa.
What a lot of wine.
I think he's madmans.
He drinks.
Well, he's a poet, Spiro.
- (Gunshot)
- Oh, blessed!
(Animated chatter)
Oh!
This house is riddled with rot.
(Gunshot)
(Gunshot)
Death to the tyrants!
(Barks)
(Whimpers)
Look, it's a tortoise waking up.
It's only got one eye.
Madame Cyclops.
There are dozens of them.
Wonderful.
Absolutely wonderful.
- Saluté.
- Saluté.
- Would you like some fruit, Gerry?
- No, thank you.
Thank you, Lugaretzia.
Has everyone had enough?
- Er, Leslie, dear?
- Thank you, Mother.
It was lovely.
(Both laughing)
Lugaretzia, you laughed.
She did!
"And the maidens they smiled, their lives awakened by the call of their hearts
"and the ardour of the poets!"
(Laughs)
Lugaretzia, is...is your stomach settled at last?
- Oh, don't ask her, please.
- Thank you, please.
(Laughing)
(Door opens and closes)
The tortoises have all wakened up from hibernation and have started mating.
(Snoring)
Larry, your friend is asleep.
Oh, yes.
- Who is he?
- He's a poet, dear.
An elderly and distinguished poet.
(Snoring)
Oh, no!
Oh... (Snoring)
Some of my friends are younger and much more boisterous.
We can't have people to stay if everything falls to pieces.
We shall have to buy more furniture.
Really, these guests are going to be the most expensive we've ever had.
(Snoring continues)
(Spiro) I figures it this way, I gets them for half the prices you gots to pay.
You must not be seated.
They all laughs at Spiro Americano the bum if you are seated.
I buys them for you.
I am the only one who can seat you.
Here.
Good morning.
If you ask me, Theodosius, you should have the bonfires out of all these junks.
- Spiro, go away.
- But this man will seat you.
- This man will kill you, Spiro!
- (Gerry) Quite right.
- How do you say "that's too much", Gerry?
- I tell you, he is a swindler!
You say, "Afto ine para poli."
- It is not too much, little lord.
- I'm afraid it is.
- It is very afto ine para... indeed.
- Poli.
That's rights!
That is not rights.
Go back to the car, Spiro, and wait for us there.
Mrs Durrells, his father was a swindler before him, and his grand...
Spiro...
OK, Mrs Durrells.
You are the bosses.
I wait for you.
Afto poli.
Everything is.
Mother, Gerry, I think there's a fiesta.
St Spiridon.
All days peoples comes here from everywhere in the world all days.
And they go into the church to kiss the feets of St Spiridon and all your pains go... foo!
His body does this through his feets carried through the town all days.
His holy body, all days.
Poof!
(♪ Marching tune)
I'm sure we can come to a satisfactory arrangement.
I'll send Spiro with a list.
Er, come along, Margo.
Gerry?
(♪ Marching tune continues)
(Church bells)
(♪ Band plays sombre tune)
(Whispers)
(♪ Choir chanting softly)
(Whispering) Gerry!
Gerry.
Gerry.
Gerry!
Gerry!
(Whispering) Tell her not to kiss the feet.
What?
Not to...
Kiss the air.
The...
Don't kiss the feet, kiss...the air.
Nots the feet.
Margo, don't kiss the feet.
(Kisses)
Thank you.
- Well, I hope it works.
- He looked like a silver chrysalis.
Did you see his face, Margo?
No, I thought it not wise to look up.
He's been dead for centuries, I gather.
Oh, dear, I nearly fainted.
Those shepherds, I mean, I...
They lifted me up.
I like garlic but it positively emanates from them!
Nothing wrong with a clove or two but...
What a crush.
St Spiridon is the patron saint of the island.
I am gives his name, Spiro.
Did you think he was like a chrysalis?
- I just hope it works.
- What?
- Cure my spots.
- Not likely.
Give you more, I imagine.
You see, Margo, if you kisses the feet all is cured, yes?
- (Mrs Durrell) You didn't?
- Acne should be easy for a saint.
But I told you not to. "Kiss the air," I said.
Heaven knows what germs were lurking in even live feet.
- Hundreds of people kissed them.
- Well, I didn't like not to.
Everybody else was doing it.
- Gerry?
- I didn't.
I dread to think what you're in for, Margo.
Well, a hot bath is the first thing.
You'll be lucky not to have something quite impossible.
(Snoring)
Don't do anything to wake him up.
(Larry) So your day was all right?
(Woman) It was a bit hot.
(Larry) Yes, it is hot.
- Ah, mother.
Erm...this is Jonquil.
- Hello.
- How do you do?
- Michael.
- Hello.
- And Durant.
- How do you do?
- (Yowls)
(Grunts)
(Mrs Durrell) How do you do?
(German accent) I am shattered.
I want to work but I am in a state of acute shatter.
Durant has had an experience.
I truly have.
I would rather not relate it until I am completely rested.
- Oh, of course.
- What a journey.
Why don't you sit down?
I damn the night, I am eager for the light.
I am captivated by the colour and I cannot wait to plunge into it.
They're artists, dear.
Don't talk about bleeding' work, you haven't done a scrap.
Not picnics, that sort of thing, I wanna work.
I know just what I'm going to do.
I've ordered a canvas.
A huge one!
(Spiro) This is the doctor's.
That's going to take ages.
Leslie, how long do painters take?
Don't ask me, they're Larry's friends.
How do you do, Mrs Durrell?
Ah!
Er, my daughter has a temperature of 102, doctor.
And it's all due to your blessed saint.
She foolishly kissed his feet.
Ah, pa, pa, pa, pa.
Let's see, let's see.
(Barking)
Ahh, it's Madame Cyclops.
We've seen her before.
This must be her nest.
Look, Roger.
It's Margo's fault that he has to go.
Zatopec must be very careful about his health.
Won't find him doing silly things like kissing saint's feet.
(Mrs Durrell) No, something much worse, I should imagine.
You're not trying to make my friends very welcome.
Yes, I am.
I cook immense meals.
But you don't even...talk to them.
I have nothing to say to them.
I mean, look...
look at that.
What can I have to say about that?
It's a blank.
Michael... hasn't been able to... (Sighs) He hasn't been able to...
Oh, look, he's trying.
(Yawns)
Oh. (Sneezes)
It's coming.
Don't talk to me about bleeding' work, I'm trying to get some done meself.
Oh, God, I can't tell you...
She will be better.
Much better now.
Pa, pa, pa, pa.
- But never, never the feets again.
- (Whimpers)
Pa, pa, pa, pa.
Look, this will cheer you up.
Oh, Gerry, go away.
A tortoise egg.
And look, a scorpion with hundreds of babies.
She's given birth.
Look at them clinging to her body.
I said, go away.
(Sniffs)
(Whimpers)
I'm ready at last.
I would've started today but the light went.
How can you torture me?
How does he torture you?
Durant has had an unfortunate experience.
Tell all.
I was shattered.
It was in Italy.
It was as if yesterday!
It was a masterpiece, I was painting.
An almond orchard in the full bloom.
The blooms of the trees, full and... and thick.
It was masterpiece.
I work all the day and tear myself away for the night.
Sleep like the babe, it was so good.
Then I was fresh for the morning and I returned to the masterpiece.
I was stricken.
It was gone.
The blossom was on the ground.
The wind...poof!
Gone.
I was shattered.
I swore I would never paint again.
Oh!
How sad.
How frightful.
How...
But slowly I am recovering my nerves.
I can go on.
Day by day I feel less shatter.
Sometime I will paint the masterpiece again.
Sometime...
It was as if yesterday.
Come now, it can't have been that bad.
Have you thought of pulling yourself together?
- (Sneezes)
- Bless you.
How long ago was this dreadful experience?
As if yesterday.
It was two years ago and it is still as if yesterday.
It is the fate of the artist...
I've something very interesting to show you.
Oh... (Sighs)
It's terribly...hot.
(Sighs)
Oh, dear.
- Did you have a fright?
- I've just recovered from syphilis.
I lost all my hair in Athens.
Syphilis...?
Larry, I'd like a word with you.
I have not been able to obtain eyebrows and wig to match.
But I'm sure I will in Paris.
It's disgusting.
You allow that woman into my house with a disgusting disease like syphilis.
- You call her a friend?
- She's not a friend.
She's just a character I invited here to study.
Gerry is a child.
You invite her and we all catch it, Gerry as well, while you take notes.
You won't catch it, unless you share a bed.
Don't be revolting.
What about Margo's flu?
My friends might catch that.
That's not the same as syphilis!
Michael's caught something and Zatopec fled.
- Gerry?
- Yes, mother?
Don't sit next to that woman.
I'm not.
I'm standing here.
- There is syphilis...
- Don't say that word in front of Gerald.
I'll explain it later.
We ought to go back.
- Our friends might think something's wrong.
- Yes, well, something is.
I've had enough food now, Mother.
Can I go outside?
Yes, dear.
Wash your hands.
He tortures me.
I have nothing... lt came to me just as the sun was going down.
- What did?
- Michael's got a subject.
I was looking at the sun.
Suddenly I thought, yes, sun!
Wonderful.
- Have I missed something?
- Don't you understand, Mother?
Michael has had a revelation!
He's seen the sun.
Trust you to scoff, Leslie.
You don't know anything.
Michael's not talking about any old sun... he's talking about...the essence of sun.
- Oh, my God, scorpions!
- (Screaming)
Kill the vermin!
Kill or be killed!
- Now, now, keep calm!
Keep calm!
- Leslie, do something.
To your right, Jonquil, to your right!
Oh!
Leslie, dear!
Oh!
My wig!
Oh!
Oh!
They're in my wig!
(Screaming)
What on earth's going on?
(All) Gerald!
(Engine starts)
Is there enough room?
- There we are.
- (Larry) Thank you so much for coming.
- Goodbye.
- (All) Goodbye!
(Gunshot)
(Horn)
(Mrs Durrell) Gerry?
Gerry, dear, will you be so kind as to give this back to Dr Stephanides?
Tell him that I enjoyed it immensely but thought the ending rather far-fetched.
(Larry) Far-fetched?
I should say so.
Larry, I hope your friends aren't going to be too highbrow.
- What on earth do you mean?
- Well...
Poetry and things.
They're perfectly ordinary, intelligent and stimulating people.
- We're in danger of stagnating.
- Oh, dear.
Stimulating.
That means I shan't understand a word they say.
You would if you didn't read such lurid trash.
They are not.
They're very good detective stories.
Yes, well, just hide them when my friends are here.
Oh, dear.
I knew they'd be highbrow.
Oh, dear.

That was my young brother, Gerald.
I suppose he could be called handsome.
No, no.
He's a son of a bitch Turk.
And he's uglys!
Very, very uglys!
He's very uglys!
(Horn)
- Gosh!
- Hm?
Oh, yes, a rhinoceros beetle.
Ah.
Now look.
There.
You see, this will interest you.
I was looking through my slides before you came, and, as you know, the rat flea...
There.
Now, can you see?
The mouthparts.
You should be able to see this with your own microscope, oh, not so well, but if you know Ceratophyllus fasciatus,
I always think a fasciatus...
If you look, one can almost imagine it to be a human face.
But no, the rat flea.
And here, in the live box...
Now, this will interest you.
Ah.
Careful not to get your fingers on the subject slide.
Ah.
Now.
What do you say to this?
Hm.
Cyclops viridis.
The Crustacea family, the same family as crabs and shrimps.
I'll just adjust the...
- Ah, now look.
Can you see the egg sacs?
- Yes.
As you know there are several species of cyclops on Corfu.
I caught this one this morning.
A single eye, hence, as you know, Cyclops, hm?
Hm.
- Hm.
- Hm.
Mother.
He's arrived.
Leslie, you are to behave like a gentleman.
Isn't he the handsomest object you've ever seen, and doesn't he know it?
Where does Margo find them?
Please.
We must try to be nice to him.
- We'll be terribly nice to him, won't we?
- Oh, yes.
Where's Gerry?
We could do with a box of crawly things.
He's the crawliest thing I've ever seen.
Why doesn't Spiro cut their throats and save us an awful lot of politeness?
Now, that is enough.
Goodbye.
It's been a pleasure having you.
What are you concerning yourself with at the moment?
Swallows, as a matter of fact.
As you know, they're incubating.
That is interesting.
What about next Thursday?
If you are free.
- I'm sure to be.
- We might take a walk.
See what we can obtain.
There are some fascinating ditches in the Val di Ropa.
Yes.
- Thank you.
- Not at all.
Ah.
- Goodbye.
- Yes.
Goodbye.
How nice to meet you.
He kisses hands all the time.
I find it so romantic.
It will be lovely having you.
Well, it's so often to, erm... (Stammers) Days simply fly.
Margo's told us so much about you.
- So has Spiro.
- Spiro?
- Oh, he's a gangster from Chicago.
- Yes, a good shot.
Oh, much better with a Tommy gun than I am.
Yes, but like all Greeks he prefers the knife.
- Stop it, you two.
- Yes, do.
- Do have a scone.
- So kind.
- Is he talking to you?
- No, I think he means himself.
- Yasha is on holiday here.
- That's amazing.
You know, I had a holiday once.
I remember it quite clearly.
Sugar?
Sugar in your tea?
- So kind.
- He said it again!
He does mean himself!
You know, Leslie, we're so lucky.
- That he can spare the time?
- Absolutely.
Hello, dear.
Have you had a good time?
Yes.
The most interesting thing was the mouthparts of a rat flea, as a matter of fact.
Oh.
- Theo sent this for you.
- Thank you.
Ah, Spiro.
This is a friend of Margo's.
Yes.
I knows him.
You write, I believe.
Yes.
Yes.
He writes away, day after day.
Always tapping at the typewriter at, erm... at something or other.
I always feel I could write superbly if I tried.
Really?
Well, it's a gift, I suppose, like so many things.
No accounting for who brings...has...gifts.
Yes.
- He swims superbly.
- Yes, I do.
- Goes out terribly far.
- Not far enough.
Yes.
I have no fear.
I am the superb swimmer so I have no fear.
It is the same when I ride the horse.
I ride superbly, for I have no fear.
I can also sail the boat wondrously and through the typhoon magnificently without fear.
You see, I am not a fearful man.
I, er...
I'm astonished to meet you.
Leslie?
(Leslie) Er...excuse us.
(Gunshot)
Would you be so kind as to accompany me to the cinema tomorrow evening?
- Would I?
- Would you like to, dear?
- I don't know.
- Well, if you want to, why not?
- Yes.
- Yes.
And I'll come with you.
You look lovely, dear.
You're going to have a jolly evening, Mother.
- I can't let her go on her own.
- Especially with a Turk.
(Imitates Spiro) Oh, no, they are sons of bitches.
Shut up, Larry.
I haven't been to the pictures in years.
(Woman) Tell us, what happened?
You're hurt.
(Man) No, no, it's nothing.
(Woman) What is it?
Tell me?
Thérèse, I can't tell you.
It's a duel.
Another woman.
(Man) There's no other woman for me.
There never has been.
(Thérèse) Then why can't you tell me?
I can keep a secret.
I'm not just any woman.
I'm the woman you're going to marry.
(Mrs Durrell) It was awful!
(Laughter)
I'm so glad you've come back.
We thought you'd flown with him.
Even now, galloping behind him on a camel to Constanople.
- Constantinople.
- That's what I said.
Yashmaks rippling seductively in the breeze on the Bosphorus.
It was awful.
(Man) Those who accept the oath, step forward.
As you please.

- What sort of flea?
- I don't know.
I couldn't scratch.
I had to press my back against the seat.
Really, everybody must have noticed.
(Mrs Durrell) In the first interval he went out and came back laden with Turkish Delight.
- I thought that was very sweet of him.
- It was so sticky.
We were covered in white sugar.
I got the most fearful thirst.
Yes.

(Speaks Turkish)
He's Greek.
He doesn't understand.
I speak many languages.
I study everything.
Yes, but what did you say?
You will be most amused.
I said, "I fear you will not reach Mecca, oh nomad,
"for the road which you follow leads to Turkistan."
(Laughs)
Gee up, driver.
Gee up.
Took hours to get home.
Hours.
- (Driver speaks Greek) - (Yasha replies)
He says he cannot go any further because of the hill.
- I must come with you.
- That won't be necessary.
- I have no fear of serpents.
- I'm sure you haven't.
Neither have I. Good night.
You cannot go up the hill.
The forests are full of serpents.
But I have no fear of them.
I am fearful of nothing!
- Did he mean snakes?
- I suppose so.
We didn't see any.
I thought we were going to have to ask him in.
- Why didn't you?
- Didn't need to.
- (Whispers) Aristotle.
- Spiro.
(Speaks Greek)
(Yasha) Stop at once!
Thank goodness he never reached the door, otherwise politeness would have demanded that we invite him in and he'd still be here.
- How fearful!
- And I'd still be desperate for a scratch.
Oh, Margo, you must be more careful in future over your choice of boyfriends.
- I couldn't go through all that again.
- But he was so handsome.
It could take me a long time to get over this, I'm afraid.
Well into the middle of next week, I imagine.
(Laughter)
You want a rides into town, Turk?
I takes you for a rides.
But it will cost you very much monies.
Very much.
- Gerry, kalimera...
- Good morning!

You'd better let the Swiss pension know how many and when.
- I do hope they're not too arty.
- Pension Suisse?
Why?
So they can reserve the rooms.
Well, I've invited them here to stay with us.
- Where?
- Here.
Where are they going to sleep?
Oh, I've sorted all that out.
Les and Margo can sleep in the olive press and you and Gerry have the drawing room.
No fear.
Margo can't sleep in the olive press.
She's a young girl.
- No fears.
- Who asked you, Spiro?
(Laughs) You listen to your mother.
- How many?
- Three or four.
Four or five.
- You can jolly well write and tell them not to come.
- I can't.
They're on their way.
Look!
- Take that awful thing out.
- They're on their way?
Well, if they are, they've got to be stopped.
This villa is too small.
I didn't know you were going to treat the arrival of a few friends as a major catastrophe.
- Spiro will have to find us a bigger one.
- Big bathrooms.
- The English always want bathrooms.
- Yes, certainly with...
No!
- We're not going to move because you...
- We're living like hermits.
- I don't want to move.
- I'm only thinking of you, Mother.
You used to like having people around you.
They're a charming crowd.
Charming.
I only asked them for you.
I thought they might liven things up a bit for you.
- Quite lively enough, thank you.
- Mr Larrys.
Your mother is a saint.
- How many?
- Friends?
One or two.
At a time.
I expect they'll come in batches.
If you reckon on seven or eight you can always stretch it to ten, whereas if you think small you're certain to be disappointed.
- With us?
- With us what?
Seven or eight with us?
Me, Gerry, Margo and, I suppose, Leslie.
- Suppose Leslie what?
- You're not including him.
Us.
- That's 13.
- What is?
We can't possibly fit 13 people into this villa.
Then there's a solution.
Spiro will have to find us another one.
- No!
- No.
Why?
We're not going anywhere until the swallows have grown and flown hence.
- Is that a Greek proverb?
- Yes.
There are manys.
- I won't have it, Larry.
- Have what, Mother?
- Larry has invited hordes of his friends.
- Not hordes.
I can never understand a word they say.
And they're all effeminate.
Just because they don't rush around the countryside shooting everything that moves and some things that don't.
That's a good test of character.
Or lack of it.
Yes.
Jolly queer lot.
Ballet dancers, that sort of thing.
Yes.
Writers, that sort of thing.
Queer poems.
What is that on my toast?
It's all right.
It's one of Gerry's.
And that's another thing.
If we move, what about his lessons?
He'll still have lessons.
And if we're in a bigger villa, more of them.
I don't quite see your reasoning, dear.
I nearly buttered the blasted thing.
(Theo) Hm, thought it was.
The oil beetle.
A female.
It lays its eggs in the soil, little yellow eggs, and when the larvae hatch out they climb up the stems of the nearest flowers into the blooms, into the tucks of the petals.
And there they wait for a bee.
And if they're lucky, the bee is a female collecting honey for her egg chamber.
The larvae hitches a ride.
He's sealed into the cell with the egg and the honey, eats it and develops.
Meloi pro scarabaeus.
How peculiar.
Hitching a ride on a bee.
Pegasus with a sting in the tail.
Talking of horses, did I ever tell you of my triumphant entry into Smirna?
When we, er...
That's in Turkey.
When we won in the last war...
Well...
Not a good rider.
But I was told I had to lead my battalion into, erm...
Yes.
So I did.
A triumphal column led by a man on a white horse.
Er...me.
Well, er...
As you know, in Greece we throw scent, rose-water, that sort of thing, over conquering heroes.
It, er...got in his eye.
My white horse went off like a rocket, me hanging on like grim death.
I was caught, of course.
Told to clear off.
No white horse.
No me.
Yes.
Left to slink through the back streets, reeking of rose-water.
And, well...
No such thing.
No horses, triumphant or otherwise, stinking of rose-water or anything else.
No.
Never been on a horse since.
No such thing in the next one.
That's why I want to see as many of my friends as I can.
Soon.
(Theo) Yes.
I've made up my mind.
We are not moving to another villa.
(Mrs Durrell) We are not moving.
(Margo) That bag on the... (Mrs Durrell) The yellow one?
Yes, darling.
What I'm worried about is the keys to the new villa.
(Spiro) Yes, I've got them.
(Mrs Durrell) Gerry, have you got all the things packed?
- Yes.
- Thank you.
(All talk at once)
Sit on my knee, Gerry.
- Everybody there?
- All in?
- Come on, Larry.
- OK, Mrs Durrells?
- Yes.
- Move over, Margo.
- OK?
- OK!
All right.
(Coughs)
There he is.
Stay here.
(They laugh)
(Cock crows)
Got him!
Got him, Mother.
Look.
Kosti helped.
Isn't he splendid?
Thanks for looking after the dogs.
Now, where can I put him?
There is very little we cannot achieve, Gerald, If we persevere.
That's the ticket, eh?
Persevere.
Boire.
Je bois, tu bois, elle boit, nous buvons, vous buvez, il bolt.
Oui.
Très bon.
Aller.
Je vais, tu vas, il va.
We're having a party.
Would you like to come?
We're calling it a Christmas party because it's September.
Will you come?
En Français, Gerald, en Français, monsieur.
Oui.
Well...
RSVP?
(Laughs)
Yes, you're learning.
(Honks horn)
- Mrs Durrell.
- Good afternoon, Mr Kralefsky.
- Might I have a word?
- Er, yes.
Yes, yes, of course.
- I have taught him all I can.
- Good.
- Please don't interrupt, Spiro.
- He's a clever boy.
Yes, yes, he is, but now he must go to somewhere like England or Switzerland
- to finish his education completely.
- Just a minute.
- Be quiet, Gerry.
- He is only half-educated.
- I...
- Yes.
Theodore thinks exactly the same as you.
I like being half-educated.
Just think how awful it would be if you knew everything.
No, no, no, no.
You must know everythings like I know everythings, because I live in America where everythings is.
It really is for his own good.
No, it has to be thought about.
Thank you, Mr Kralefsky.
(Honks horn)
Talk to me, my little songbird.
Talk to me.
(Whispers) Talk to me.
(Mrs Durrell) Oh, that's good, isn't it?
Most realistic.
Don't let Leslie see the snakes, though, will you?
What it really needs is goldfish.
Hm.
Yes, that would be nice.
Larry, what are you doing to help with this party?
My contribution will be to attend.
(Sighs)
Mother.
I suppose the only place you can get something like goldfish will be somewhere like Athens.
Yes.
Yes, I suppose so.
(Magpie) Spiro!
Hm.
What you gots there, Master Gerrys?
- What it needs, Spiro, is goldfish.
- Goldfish?
What's thems?
Fish, like carp, but with a gold colour.
There's no goldfish in Corfu.
What for you want goldfish?
- For the party, Spiro.
- Nah, na, na.
I brings turkeys, my missus cooks turkeys.
You don't needs golden fish.
(Laughs)
Not to eat, Spiro, to put in the trough for people to see.
OK, OK.
Spiro get you golden fish.
(Magpie) Spiro!
Listen, you stop them magpies and I get you golden fish, OK?
OK.
So what are you going to do about it, then?
We'll have to go back to England, talk to the trustees about it all.
Yes, I suppose so.
- I haven't any money.
- Oh, I'm sure I've got plenty.
Somewhere.
Shares, things like that.
I've always found in the past that when I've talked to the trustees face to face, they've always turned out to be very sympathetic.
I'm sure they'd agree that...
Gerry has to go to a real school.
Poor little devil.
(Goat bells ringing)
(Greet each other in Greek)
(Gerry) Where are we going?
(Spiro) Shhh.
Shhh.
OK, Master Gerrys, you stays here.
I won't be longs.
Aristidis.
Aristidis, where are you, you bastards?
(Knocks)
Aristidis!
Spiro.
(Exchange in Greek)
You bastard!
(Mutters)
There you ares, Master Gerrys.
Don't say a word to nobodys.
Nobodys.
Sh, sh, sh.
Thank you, Spiro, they're huge.
Yeah.
Biggest goddamn golden goldfish on the islands.
But who did the house belong to?
Never you mind, Master Gerrys.
You just keep these golden goldfish hidden and don't tell anyone where you gottens them.
(Whispers) They belongs to the kings of Greece.
(Dogs barking outside)
Oh, Dodo.
You would choose this day to become interesting to men.
(All barking)
Yah!
Bloody mutts.
Mother's such a scatterbrain about money.
Don't worry, Father left lots of the stuff.
You're as bad as she is.
What happens if the well runs dry.
What then?
We can get some more, can't we?
You can sell something, one of those books you're writing.
I'm trying.
I like it here.
So do I.
- We have to go back to England?
- Yeah, just to sort a few things out.
But don't tell Gerry yet, will you?
No, all right.
The poor little devil, he loves the place.
Missed it.
Mother.
I really ought to have two ponds.
Er, yes, dear, how nice.
Oh, and Gerry, try to keep those stray dogs out of the garden.
(Exchange in Greek)
(Squawks)
Oh, no!
- Can I put them in the bath?
- What, dear?
They've been left out in the sun too long.
Can't you do it later?
You ought to change.
We've got a lot of people coming.
But they'll die.
They're too hot.
Can I put them in the bath for an hour or so?
It might save them.
Yes, all right, but not if anybody's in it.
And don't forget to disinfect it afterwards.
I don't suppose anybody will want a bath.
(Squawking)
Our guests will be here at any moment, so make sure everyone has plenty to drink.
(Speaks Greek)
Good.
Now, Spiro, the food.
Mrs Durrells!
Those goddamn magenpies!
Oh, no.
Those birds!
Gerald, I am...
I am seriously annoyed.
They must have got drunk.
I beg your pardon?
They must have got drunk on the beer and wine.
I thought I could tell you that there was a sudden gale, but of course there wasn't a sudden gale.
It was them.
I'm sorry.
Well, I suppose... if they were drunk...
Oh, Margo.
- (Sighs)
- Well, what are we going to do?
Come on, everybody. (Sighs)
Gerald, the mayonnaise.
Come on.
Oh, trust the pair of you not to be around when you're needed.
It's an art, Margo.
They'll all be here in a moment, go and get changed.
Good morning.
Welcome.
- Welcome to the Durrells' residence.
- Well, thank you.
This way.
- Ah, Spiro.
- ln there.
Just like a man.
Hello.
Good morning, good morning.
This way.
(Chatter)
(Dogs barking)
This is OK, it's locked.
They can't get in, the goddamn dogs.
They won't get in, Mrs Durrels.
- Have you seen Dodo?
- She's locked up.
- Where?
- She's OK.
She's in there.
(Barking)
(Barking continues)
(Whispers) Shut up.
Shut up!
Shut up!
(Bellows) Shut up!
(Dogs quieten down)
(Laughs) It's OK.
It's OK.
Be happy.
I'll catches them bastards.
Alecko!
Alecko!
(Leslie) Agh!
Snakes!
Snakes!
Gerry!
Oh, now what?
Gerry!
Leslie, dear, whatever is the matter?
That bloody boy has filled the flaming bath with bleeding snakes!
You!
Leslie, dear, language.
- Great things like hissing hosepipes!
- I told him he could put them there.
Oh, really, Mother, that's going too far.
It might have been me.
Larry, don't you start.
It was Leslie who was bathing with the snakes.
Only Francis of Assisi would feel at home here.
I think you're making a lot of fuss about nothing.
Quite.
Remove the snakes if they offend you so.
Gerald, remove your snakes.
Now, I'm sorry, but you'll have to.
Put them in the wash hand basin.
No.
No, no, no.
They've got to be completely outside.
I...
I just can't bear them.
Come on!
Oh, dear.
Oh, Spiro.
Did you remember the turkeys?
Who?
(Larry) Excellent.
Has everyone got a seat?
Good.
You mean to say Margo's actually laid it properly?
This place is a deathtrap.
Each nook is filled with malignant faunae waiting to pounce.
How any of us have escaped being maimed for life is beyond me.
A simple action like opening a box of matches is fraught with danger, for what may lurk inside?
Now we have snakes in the bath and huge albatrosses in flocks flapping and spreading their evil luck.
Have you noticed the wind has changed?
Typhoons, they bring typhoons.
Larry, dear, you do exaggerate.
I speak nothing but the truth.
If anything, I understate.
What about that night Quasimodo decided to sleep with me?
- Well, that wasn't very dreadful.
- Oh, really, Margo?
It may give you pleasure to be woken at 3:30 in the morning by a pigeon intent on pushing his rectum into your eye.
(Screaming)
Scorpions.
I've been bitten on the leg.
It's a...a...
- Gerry, you've got bears under there.
- No, I haven't.
No, it appears to be some sort of bird.
Er...
large.
Brown and er... white?
- Blasted albatross.
- Magenpie.
No, it's not a magen...er, magpie, it's some sort of gull, I think.
Yes, it is.
It's Alecko.
I thought he'd gone for a swim.
Be still, everyone, unless you want your leg severed at the knee.
Oh!
(Shrieks)
Do you require any assistance, dear boy?
Well, you could...
No, I think I'll be all right.
He's in a bad mood.
I think this is going to take some time.
(Larry) Oh, do hurry up.
The soup's getting cold.
Can't you poke it with something?
What do they eat?
I specialise in songbirds.
All the nice gulls love a sailor.
(Laughs)
Oh, really, Theodore, you're like an 1880 edition of Punch.
(Gull shrieks)
(Applause)
(Screams)
Well done.
I'm so sorry.
Is there anything I can get you?
(Laughter)
Mrs Durrells.
Yes, Spiro?
I brings them turkeys.
Who?
(They laugh)
- You wants that I should carve them?
- Yes, thank you, Spiro.

(Barking)
(Screams)
Wolves, wolves, waiting for a hard winter.
- Now, keep calm, everybody, keep calm.
- (Mrs Durrell) That's Dodo.
By Jove, save the ladies!
(Barking drowns speech)
(Laughs)
Pepper is also good for a dogfight, although I've never tried it.
Water, also.

I fix these damn pests.

Serpents.
My snakes!
(Screaming continues)
Oh, dear.
I wonder if everybody's had enough...
had enough to eat.
- Goodbye, Mr Kralefsky.
- Bye, Mrs Durrell.
Have a good journey.
I will not say goodbye.
I'd rather say au revoir.
By Jove, yes.
Au revoir, monsieur, what?
- That's the ticket.
- Bye, Mr Kralefsky.
- Goodbye, Mr Kralefsky.
- Bye, Theo.
- Goodbye.
- Bye, Theo.
Goodbye, Spiro.
Goodbye, Master Gerrys.
(Sobs)
Honest to Gods, I didn't means to crys.
It's just like saying goodbyes to my own family.
I'm sorry, Mrs Durrells.
Just look what that man in the customs has written. "Description of passengers..."
(Reads aloud)
Really, some people are peculiar.
That's what you get for leaving Corfu.
I just met you
Yet I'm feeling
It seems that somehow we met somewhere before
I think I loved you
In my dreams 100 times or maybe more
What a connection
I just can't conceal it
There's a kind of magic in the air
Ooh, I can feel it
Something special
Is gonna happen tonight
I want you to know that
Something special
Is gonna happen tonight
I promise I'll be good to you
What a connection
I just can't conceal it
There's a kind of magic in the air
Ooh, I can feel it
Something special
Is gonna happen tonight
I want you to know that
Something special
Is gonna happen tonight
I promise I'll be good to you
Something special
Is gonna happen tonight
Oh!
All right.
That's it.
- What's the matter, Marie?
What happened?
- She tried to kill me.
- Well, isn't that the point?
- No, Lauren.
This is theatrical fencing.
This isn't an autopsy.
All right?
All right.
Damn it!
I don't even know why we have to do this.
If you want to do Shakespeare, Shakespearean people have duels.
- Not the women.
- It's my ambition to play Hamlet.
Oh, that'll pack 'em in the aisles.
Yes.
Paulette.
Lan.
Good.
Lauren.
Excellent.
Naomi.
Bitch.
- Lauren.
- Hi, George.
- Have dinner with me tonight.
- What?
- Say, "Yes."
- George.
- Say, "Yes."
- Why are you acting like this?
Because I wanna be with you.
Well, that's nice.
This is so funny, George.
I thought you were gay.
Oh, I am.
It's just, I play so many heterosexual roles...
I feel I really need to do some serious research.
Mm-hmm.
And just when you think there's no greater depth... to which an actor could possibly sink.
- That's nothin'.
Remember Fred?
- Fred.
I've got a 50 percent hearing loss in this ear... from him yelling "Stella" in bed.
I tell ya, I swore off actors a year ago.
I said if that's the only subspecies of men available...
I'd rather not date at all.
And I haven't.
But there are other things.
My work, I perfect my craft.
L...
Kor...
Korzenowski!
- Yeah.
- He's taking students.
- Hey, but where you gonna get that kind of money?
- L...
I gotta use that phone.
Come on.
You're up.
Who is it?
It's your sister-in-law.
Hurry up.
My feet are falling off.
Well, hi, Shirley.
I'm glad you finally...
Wait a minute.
Get in front of the camera.
- I knew it.
- Come on, Mom.
Let me in.
No, we can't afford it.
Mom, please.
- Is that my baby?
- Daddy!
Yes, but she can't come in.
She wants a loan.
Daddy, can I come in, please?
Please, please, please, please, please, Daddy?
Daddy?
- Daniel, what are you doing?
- Oh, yes.
- You don't know she wants money.
- Of course she does.
- You don't know that.
- That's right, Mom.
Can't I just drop in to see my parents?
Okay, I need $5,000.
- But it's to study with Korzenowski. - $5,000.
- She might have a good reason.
- Daddy!
Stanislav Korzenowski.
- $5,000, Daniel.
- I'll pay you back.
- What did you say?
W
- What was that?
- I know I owe you some money.
- You owe us $3 2,000.
But it's the Korzenowski.
Lauren, we sent you to Yale and London and the institute.
You have been at this acting thing for years, and you haven't earned a dime.
You are still working as a salesgirl!
- Honey, face it.
Maybe it's time for you to give it up.
- Daddy.
- Daniel.
Hey, what did you do?
- Oh.
Oh, Daddy.
- Nothing.
- You gave her that money?
- Oh, Daddy.
- I cannot believe that you did that.
- She is our only child.
- Oh.
Oh, Daddy!
- I can't believe it.
She is sucking us dry.
- $5,000.
Thank you, Daddy!
- She isn't.
Well, I just got another bill from Bloomingdale's.
- Oh, thank you.
- Drop that now.
Don't you dare start talking about that.
Give me back my fuckin' quarter!
Damn!
Well, good luck.
I'm Lauren Ames.
There's my application, your board, your pen.
- Thank you.
- And my down payment.
Keep that for now.
You still have to audition.
- Right.
- Sit down.
Mr Korzenowski will call you.
Thank you.
You nervous?
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
- I mean, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
It's okay.
No, I'm...
I'm not...
It's fine.
I guess we're all a little bit, uh...
Don't talk.
Right.
Oh, boy.
I don't blame you.
This is so intense.
Shut up, Weldon.
- I'm sorry.
Sorry.
- Holy Mary!
Isn't there one fucking phone in this whole town that works?
You got a phone I can use?
Yeah, hi.
This is Sandy Brozinsky.
Who's this?
Howie.
Okay, Howie.
I'm holding in my hand this thingee... says you're gonna turn off my phone at noon.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I wanna tell you somethin'.
I just got out of the hospital.
I get home after two months of intensive care... they wheel me into my building, I open my mailbox...
I find your thingee screaming at me I have till 12 noon today...
Hey, no, you listen.
You listen!
I just opened the damn thing.
I just now laid eyes on it for the first time.
What was I supposed to do?
Have 'em unhook the life-support machine so I could pay my bills?
Oh, really?
Yeah, so now I have three...
No, make that two minutes... to write a check and wheel myself down to your office?
Howie, is that the drill?
24 hours?
24 big ones?
All right, Howie.
You're a prince among men.
I mean it.
I wanna have your child.
Yeah, bye.
No, stop!
Please, do not screech at anyone else.
I am trying to prepare for an audition here.
Thank you.
Oh, yeah?
What for?
A workshop with Stanislav Korzenowski.
Who's that?
Only one of the great geniuses of the theatre.
Now if you don't mind.
Hey, maybe I should audition for him too.
I'm an actress.
Hey, no, I'm a pro.
I bet I'm more of a pro than you.
Uh-huh.
Well, I just made 2,500 bucks doin' a movie, yeah.
That's where I've seen you.
It has been driving me crazy.
- You saw Ninja Vixens?
- I, uh, must have.
Huh.
Well, this whole acting thing's been goin' pretty good.
I mean, it's all just bullshittin', right?
Actors are just bullshitters who get paid.
Where do I sign up?
Just exactly what do you think you're going to do in there?
I don't know.
I'll make somethin' up.
You're going in to Stanislav Korzenowski and wing it?
Jesus, you'd think I was gonna go in and pee on him.
Listen to me.
You do not audition for a man of Korzenowski's reputation... without a prepared classical monologue.
That means Shaw, Ibsen, Shakespeare.
I'm doing Ophelia's mad scene.
I'm not waltzing in off the street... saying, "Gee, I think I wanna be an actress."
You know what I bet?
I bet you haven't been laid in about a year.
- Ames, Lauren.
- Ah, ah.
Yes, I'm coming.
I'm...
I'm...
I will be co...
I'm...
I'm...
I'm ready.
I'm...
I'm...
- I'm ready.
- Quickly, Miss Ames.
I have a good mad scene.
It's really great.
I just saw it.
Hmm.
I will not only wish you to absorb everything that I say.
I will also wish you to keep notes of everything that I say.
And I will wish to look at those notes.
Now if you say this is like high school...
I do not apologize.
I am an old egotist... and I want to know that you record my ideas.
If you do not, you're gone from the class.
All right.
We begin.
We begin with vowel groups.
Vowel groups.
Mr Weldon... do you know the difference between a Texas diphthong... and a Georgia diphthong?
Sorry I'm late.
They made me fill out all these dumb-ass financial aid forms.
You want 'em?
You want 'em?
I cannot believe...
I absolutely cannot believe he let her in!
And on scholarship!
I just bet I know what she did as an audition.
The woman has no training, no experience.
I mean, correct me if I'm wrong.
I really thought if you worked at your craft, maybe... just possibly, you'd get to work with one of the greats.
It's $2.95, not $295.
I knew that.
Something's seriously wrong with my life.
Excuse me.
- Are you all right?
- Better.
L-I w...
I was just, um...
- Who cares?
May I help you?
- Yeah.
- Have you got something in a pumpkin?
- The shade pumpkin?
- No, a pumpkin costume.
- Oh.
God, I sound like an idiot.
The reason is that I teach grammar school.
- You're a schoolteacher?
- Uh-huh.
- You're not an actor?
- Oh, God, no.
I'd be awful.
Why do you ask?
Oh, well, there's just so many actors who come in here.
Please go on.
Well, we're putting on a little pageant... and there's a kid in my class who's very insecure.
You know, the other kids pick on him and his mother doesn't sew... and I think it would give him such a boost... to have the best darn costume in the place.
So I thought a professional costumers would have an incredible pumpkin.
But I can't go more than $50... because this is coming out of my own pocket.
I'm really sorry.
I don't think we have a pumpkin.
What about a squash?
We don't have any vegetables as such.
I'm sorry.
Well, this is the last place on the list.
But I'll just throw something together myself, huh?
I really appreciate your time.
Thanks.
Um, uh, listen.
I don't know, maybe, uh, maybe someone...
Maybe I could, uh...
I've made a lot of my own costumes.
I'm sure it wouldn't be that difficult.
If I could help out, I'd... like to.
That would be fabulous.
- I hope you'll forgive me, Lauren.
- For what?
L...
I don't usually lunge at women like that.
- Oh.
- But you just, uh...
I just had to kiss you.
L-I really am sorry and I hope that you'll want to see me again.
Oh, where in the world did you come from?
- New Mexico, originally.
- No, no, I mean... how can a man so delightful as you... be just wandering the streets of New York?
Single, single, yeah.
I can't believe it.
Well, that's not by choice.
I'd like to be married.
- This isn't happening.
- Why not?
Well, there must be something wrong with you.
Don't you have any faults?
I smoke.
You smoke?
That's it?
Call the police!
No, no, no.
It's an addiction.
Colton's tobacco.
New Mexico's finest.
I hope you don't mind.
Well, I'll struggle through somehow.
Good.
Very good.
Because, uh, I'd like to see you again... tomorrow night.
Well, yes.
Mmm, thank you.
What's this?
"Ooh, eee, ooh, ah, ooh, eee, ah, ooh."
- That's what you do in acting class?
- Those are vowel groups.
Mmm, sorry. "Wowel" groups.
- Ooh. - Ooh.
- Ooh.
- Ooh, I feel the same way.
- Ooh, ooh.
Will you please kiss me hard on the lips?
That was tender, but tasty.
- Bite my face.
- Okay.
Bite my leg.
Now bite my other leg.
- You get her two 1 X legs and...
- Going over the fence gymnastics?
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, my.
That kind of evening, huh?
Not the kind you're used to.
No money changed hands.
No, no, no, no.
Reveal, reveal.
You have killed your father.
You have married your mother.
Na, no words, remember.
Na, reveal.
Here we have a sick sea lion.
Go.
- Miss Brozinsky.
- Okay.
You will now perform for us, also without words...
Hamlet's soliloquy.
Who's that?
Hamlet.
Hamlet.
Shakespeare's tragedy of Hamlet.
Ah, well.
Uh, for her, we get the comic book, huh?
Taxi!
Hey!
Hey!
Oh.
Ooh, that creep Korzenowski is driving me nuts.
Ooh.
I know what I need.
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Ooh.
To die on the stage... is perhaps the greatest single challenge... an actor can face.
The audience must know, must absolutely believe... that the breath, that the very life... is going out of your body.
Now...
You!
You will die now, please.
No, no, I don't believe you.
Maintain your focus.
Na, I don't believe you.
- Maintain your focus and lean forward.
- Stop, stop, stop.
Stop it.
Stop it.
- Are you all right?
- Fine.
Perhaps you would like to die for us now, Miss Ames.
You, I think, I will shoot.
You will feel the bullet enter your body.
You will lose all muscle control.
You will fall down dead.
Bang.
This can only be the achievement... of years of training.
No other way would we ever see so false a performance.
So mechanical, so thought-out.
Never for one moment truly felt.
Here, you must reach deep inside yourself.
You must go beyond the safety of what you know.
We know you can act, Camille... but can you be a person of flesh and blood?
Ah, time.
We die again tomorrow.
And, uh, please, give me your notebooks.
I wish to see them.
You can't walk there!
Hey, Ed, you want the delivery or not?
The man is a Nazi.
I have never been the dumbest in any class before.
I haven't seen you for nine hours.
Taxi!
Taxi!
Mmm.
- You know what today is?
- No.
It's our third-week anniversary.
- Stop on the next corner.
- You got it.
- I think you need some roses.
- Oh, no, no, you can't afford any more flowers.
- Right here.
- No, don't stop.
- Half...
Half a dozen.
- No, don't stop.
I know what teachers make.
Don't stop.
Michael!
A crowd is gathered here.
Traffic is backed up for two blocks.
Killed in the explosion are Lee Veran, the owner of the flower shop... and Michael Santers, a teacher at Holmes Elementary School.
Two terrorist groups have claimed responsibility for the blast.
It's all right, Miss Ames.
We've got a positive ID from his wallet.
You don't have to see him.
I want to see him.
I warn you, there's very little left to see.
Particularly in the, uh, upper body region.
I wanna see him.
I'm very sorry you feel a need to do this.
Just leave me alone with him, please.
What are you doing here?
- Me?
What the fuck are you doing here?
- I beg your pardon.
- I am in mourning.
- Well, so am I!
- For my lover.
- Well, so am I!
- Who?
- Michael Santers.
- No, no, you little witch!
No!
- You bitch, you didn't know him!
- Oh, he loved me.
- How could you lie, little bitch?
- Oh, get away from me!
Oh!
- Get out of here right now!
- I'm gonna bitch-slap you!
I'm gonna break every bone in your body!
- Oh, you are?
- Oh, you are?
- Yes, I am!
How dare you!
How dare you!
- Oh.
Ooh.
- He loved me.
He loved me!
Loved you?
Loved you?
- Damn right he did!
- Ha, that's obscene.
No, that's reality, baby, 'cause no way did that guy give a shit about you!
I refuse to believe for one second that he would lower himself.
Oh, he lowered himself, all right.
This is all a lie.
You are psychotic.
Yes, that's right.
I've known from the first time I saw you sleaze into that office.
You lied to that phone man... you lied your way into the class and you're lying now.
- I'm gonna get you for this!
- Whoa!
Whoa, my...
Oh!
Well, what the hell?
- Well, that's not his...
- No way.
Look at that.
- It's too small.
- It's a fuckin' pencil.
- Where's the appendix scar?
- And that little mole?
It's somebody else!
He's alive!
He's alive!
He's a...
Well, thank you.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
This was my idea.
I don't care, I'm gonna handle this.
You don't have the dimmest, dullest notion how to handle this.
You can't just walk in and bluntly announce this kind of thing.
Thing, thing.
What kind of thing are you talking about?
You can't even say it.
You sure as hell can't tell 'em.
And just what do you think the response is going to be when you do?
You suggest...
You suggest...
You suggest that on the basis of this little nugget of testimony... we spend tax dollars on an investigation?
Have you been listening to us?
The man in the morgue could not possibly be Michael Santers.
All you have to do is look at his...
If you were to look... in the region...
If you were to look down.
Michael was not a guy other guys would have made fun of in a locker room, okay?
- I think he's got the big picture now.
- Well, I don't think he does.
This guy in the morgue, whoever he is... he's got, uh...
Does the phrase "needle dick..."
"the bug fucker," mean anything to you?
- I beg your pardon!
- You big lunkhead!
Now get outta here and don't come back.
The model of tact and decorum.
Oh, who gives a shit?
He wasn't gonna help us.
Well, of course not!
You sounded insane.
Oh, it is insane.
If he's alive, where is he?
He's probably back at my house, wondering' where the hell I am.
- Taxi!
- Your house?
- Taxi!
- Oh.
- Taxi!
- Wait a minute.
- W-W-Wait just a minute here.
- Come here!
Taxi!
I don't believe for one minute that he's at your apartment.
Oh, boy, are you gonna shit cement!
Taxi!
Taxi!
If Michael is anywhere, I assure you he is at my place.
- Taxi, taxi!
- Oh, you believe that?
I believe that he loved me, that he barely knew you.
And you're... you're fantasizing a relationship that is probably...
- an isolated, drunken encounter.
- Isolated?
Isolated?
Hey, this girl does not have one-night stands.
Every guy I have ever slept with... and we are way into double digits here, has come back for more.
Every single one!
- You wanna hit me, right?
- Oh, wouldn't I just love it.
- Okay, give it a try.
Give it a try.
Let's go, let's go.
Bob and weave, honey.
Bob and weave.
- Who dresses you anyway?
- Okay, okay.
Try it.
Okay.
Stand still, you little bitch.
I'm gonna bash your little WASP brains out.
I'm gonna hit you.
I'm gonna murder you.
- That's what I'm gonna do.
- Talk about dingbats.
They'll lead us right to him.
- Nine...
Nine years of ballet!
- You're too weird to hit.
- Taxi!
- Oh, taxi!
- Taxi!
- Taxi!
Taxi!
Well, now wait just a minute.
Wait just a...
All right, all right.
Okay, okay.
You insist Michael is at your apartment.
I think he's at mine.
So we'll go to both.
If he's at your place, which I doubt... then I will tell him goodbye and good riddance.
If on the other hand he's at mine... you will find yourself a nice biker and compare tattoos.
Oh!
You see, he's here.
Now don't make a scene.
Try to be adult about this.
- Oh, my God.
- Relax, it's just thieves.
Russian thieves?
He was here.
- Colton's?
- They're looking for Michael.
Let me see.
Hi, Mrs Hardy.
- Who are these morons?
- I don't know.
Stop!
Come back!
Oh, oh.
Oh, God.
- Oh, my God.
- Help me.
Come on!
Pretty baby.
- Oh!
- Put it down.
This isn't supposed to be up.
Oh, damn!
You messed up the thingee!
You crazy bastards.
Mr Atkins, these girls are bimbos.
They know nothing.
- What do we want 'em for?
- They know he survived.
They may know where he is.
We gotta get back on the trail.
So we're gonna cover every airport, every bus depot... every train station, every car rental out of this city.
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God.
Well, so much for your apartment.
You wanna try mine?
They've been here.
Oh, my God.
Wait a minute.
Nobody's been here.
This is normal.
- Come on.
Geez!
- Oh, no.
Michael?
Michael?
Michael?
Michael?
Mi...
- He's not here.
- I'm going to find him.
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.
- Where?
Well, he... he could be hiding, he could be hurt.
I don't know.
But I know that he needs me.
Now if you'll excuse me.
Where you gonna look?
His apartment?
You think he's gonna be hangin' out at his apartment, someone wants to kill him?
Oh, well, I'm not going to his apartment.
- Then where are you going?
- Isn't that my business?
Okay, look.
Hold it, okay?
All right, if you have an idea, you might as well tell me.
And we'll both go.
We'll go find him and we'll help him out of this.
And then we'll make him choose.
- Choose?
- Yeah.
- Between us?
- Yeah.
- I doubt that he'll know your name.
- Then we're on.
I mean, you're so goddam sure it's gonna be you, what do you care?
I'm confident, yes.
Well, so am I. So let's go.
- Good.
- Oh, wait.
I gotta fluff.
Could you fluff a little faster?
- What is that?
- I got it off a Christmas tree at Saks.
- You defiled a Christmas tree?
- No one saw.
What, nothing for the nose?
Oh, Lady Di, explain this to me.
The man's afraid for his life.
He's not gonna stop and buy tobacco.
Oh, you obviously didn't spend the kind of time with Michael that I did.
- He...
He couldn't last a day without his Colton's.
- I knew that.
Uh-huh.
Did you also know this is the only place in town that carries it?
- I didn't know that.
- No, no, you didn't.
Now, listen.
This time, let me handle this.
Your simplest exchanges with people become pornographic.
- That is a fucking lie.
- Need I say more.
Excuse me, sir.
Yeah, I know the guy.
Have you seen him?
Was he here today?
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe not.
When do you think you might arrive at a decision?
Uh, over a drink?
Mm-hmm.
Wouldn't you feel better, as a person... just unselfishly helping somebody find out something she really needs to know?
No.
How 'bout dinner?
- How 'bout a blow job?
- How 'bout a...
- What did you say?
- Right here.
Right now.
Both of us.
Kind of, uh, taking turns.
- He was in here this afternoon.
- This afternoon?
- You sure it was this afternoon?
- Yeah, right at my lunch break.
1:00.
He bought 10 pouches of Colton's.
- What else?
- Nothing.
He was kinda in a hurry.
He used the phone and then he ran right out of here.
He used the phone at 1:00?
Is that it?
That's all she wrote, baby.
Here or in the back?
I think I can take care of it from here.
Couple of floozies!
Oh, my God.
- That is the most disgusting, unscrup...
- What is your problem now?
Promising sexual favours?
That sends us back to the Dark Ages.
It's something you simply do not do!
You do if you're lying.
Besides, it worked.
Excuse me, but I must have missed something.
How exactly did it work?
We're at a dead end.
- You'll see.
- I'll see?
- Howie Rinker, please.
- Oh, Howie.
- How!
San!
- Great, how 'bout you?
- Hey, Frankie, wanna paper?
Yeah?
How's your fish?
Uh-huh.
What'd the vet say?
- What does a diseased fish have to...
- Stop it.
It's in the bag.
Listen, cutey.
Seeing as how you're my main man over at the phone company...
I wanna ask you just a teensy favour, all right?
Can you tell me what number was called out of Wally Frank Tobacconist at 1:00?
- This afternoon.
Yeah, yeah, I'll hold.
- This is good.
It's probably one of those guys with polyester pants and hips.
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Uh-huh.
- Good boy.
- All right.
That's a cab company, right?
Got it.
Oh, you're a catch, How.
Our kids are gonna be gorgeous, you know that?
- See you.
- Okay, don't gloat.
Taxi!
Is that all the money you walk around with?
Well, where's yours?
I thought you were the working pornographic actress.
I went to the Bahamas.
Hi.
Can you help me?
I, uh...
I'm such a ditz.
L-I left my, uh, tennis racket in one of your cabs today.
Uh, I was picked up around, uh, uh, 77th a-a-and Broadway... at 1:00.
- Is there a reward?
- Yes.
- No.
Ooh!
Ah!
What the hell is goin' on?
What the hell you gonna do to me, huh?
- What's wrong with you?
- Yo!
Dipstick!
There's your man.
What?
- Your turn.
- Come on, Rico.
Back to work.
- I don't wanna go back to work.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, I can't talk to him.
I went to a private school.
Hey, he looks like a prince.
He's gonna love you.
Hi.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about a fare... you might've had earlier in the day.
A very attractive Cauca-ca...
Just "person" will do nicely, won't it?
Why differentiate?
You would have picked him up, uh, right outside a little smoke shop.
Does that ring any bells of any kind?
Whatsoever?
Hello?
- Tall dude?
- Yes.
- Tweed coat?
Yes, yes.
A tweed coat, right.
I don't remember a thing.
- No, no, you just said a tall dude...
- I didn't say nothin'.
Oh, come on now.
Don't give me a big song and dance.
Oh, no.
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
- He's going to hurt us.
- What the hell is the matter with you?
Why should he help us with nothin' in it for him?
All right, you tell me.
What should I do?
You're an actress.
Bullshit him.
I don't use my training to tell lies to people.
Well, what do you use it for?
Geez, it's so simple.
Hey, how'd you like to make a quick 200 bucks?
- Say what?
- 200 bucks, cash... to take us to where you, uh, took the guy.
Are you out of your mind?
We don't have $200.
Ah, chill out, would ya?
Where are we?
We've been going for miles, and I haven't seen a single white person on the street.
There's one.
Oops, they got him.
That's not funny.
- Oh, my God.
- You sure this is it?
Hey, keep your pants on.
We're coming right out, all right?
Look, you know and I know I'm never gonna get another cab to come out here to Vietnam, cue ball.
So get real, all right?
All right, I'll give you 300 bucks.
Three hundred bucks just to sit here till we get back.
Three hundred?
You're a real pain in the ass.
You know that?
- Gonna break his neck.
I'm gonna break his neck.
- Beyond belief.
- You're really determined to have us killed, aren't you?
- Hey, get over yourself.
- He's not gonna kill us.
- Oh?
Why not?
- 'Cause we're gonna be raped and murdered in this building.
- Oh!
Oh!
Ohh.
Oh, no.
Oh.
Is that urine on the floor?
- What's a little urine?
- Freeze!
- Oh, my God, he's just a child.
- Well, at least rape's out.
Let me do this.
Do you really think you should be playing with your daddy's...
Shut up!
Where's your money?
Credit cards!
- Revoked.
Where do you think?
- Your bags.
- Throw 'em over here.
- Oh, I love this bag.
Ohh!
Oh!
Oh.
I'm not hit.
You little...
Give me that, you little thug.
- I'll be damned. - What?
- It's a fake.
- Oh.
- Where'd you get this?
- Santa.
Oh, yeah?
Well, if you want to see another Christmas, you're gonna have to help us find someone.
Shh.
- Come on, man, stop begging.
- This was a mistake.
Not any more.
Police!
You're under arrest!
Don't even think about it.
Don't even fuckin' think about it, or I'll blow your fuckin' nuts off!
Do we understand each other?
Okay, turn around.
Face the wall.
Do it.
Do it!
Do it!
Do it!
- Okay, frisk 'em.
- Frisk 'em?
Damn.
Busted by two broads.
Nice buns, boys.
You been working out?
Read 'em their rights.
You have... the right to remain silent... because anything you say can... and will be used against you.
You, uh...
Attorney.
You have, uh, you have the right to an attorney.
- Shit.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I heard it, I heard it.
Hey, look, look, what do you want?
You got it.
Just talk to me.
You know, he's right.
We could make you a real sweet deal, baby.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we heard it.
Wait a minute.
Maybe they can help us find Santers.
- They don't know Santers.
- Michael Santers?
The hell you say!
He was just here.
He was just here a few hours ago.
- Rat fixed him up with a passport.
- Ah, fuck you, Gilroy.
- What the fuck you want me to say?
- Oh, we're in the phoney ID business as well.
Ain't that nice?
- What name was the passport under?
- I wanna talk to a lawyer.
Oh, yeah?
It's gonna be kind of a short conversation.
They'll have to squeegee your brains off the wall.
Yeah.
You, uh, you better tell her the name.
- She's kinda cranky.
- Yeah.
I got my period.
- John Strauss.
- John Strauss.
- Where'd he go?
- Hey, look, he's leaving town.
That's all I know.
Hey, look, I'm bein' real nice here, huh?
Why don't you be nice and, uh, open that box on the table?
Go on.
- Now, look, why don't you just keep it?
- You givin' them the money?
- Forget that we ever met.
- Are you sick?
- Turn around!
- Yeah.
Happy to.
Well, I hate to give it to you, but that was pretty good.
Yeah, it was, it was.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, a deal's a deal.
And now, my man, we wanna go to the airport.
The airport.
- Eastern Airlines flight 501...
- They don't give out passenger lists.
- You have to be police or FBI.
- You are such a dip.
This is all the FBI we need.
His luggage was totally over the weight limit.
Can you imagine the gall, trying to bribe an airline official?
He offered me $ 100 to let it go through.
- Ah, what a world.
I tell ya.
- This is the final boarding call for Eastern Airlines flight 501...
- Watch and learn.
- To Albuquerque, now boarding at gate 4 2.
Excuse, please.
I was hoping you would to help me.
Uh... how... how do I to say?
You say it quickly.
I'm off in three minutes.
My father, he's coming here.
We...
No, I tell you from the beginning.
My name is Anna.
This is my sister Elona.
My half-sister.
She does not speak English.
My father, we have not seen him since we was babies in Prague.
He send us here in suitcase on train.
We, uh, escape, you see?
- No, I'm afraid I don't.
- Now we get letter.
He escape.
He is here.
But we do not know where.
We do not know which plane.
Could be any plane.
Please, you tell us which plane.
Please?
Absolutely not.
I'm sorry.
That was the single biggest crock...
I've ever had the privilege to hear in my 19 years at this airline.
I think that deserves something.
What was the name?
- Strauss.
John Strauss.
- John Strauss.
- Here we go.
- Uh-huh.
Flight 501 to Albuquerque.
- Looks like you just missed him.
- Oh, no!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
He took another line through St Louis, and it's delayed.
If I can put you on our flight 225 through Kansas City...
- you can beat him.
- Yeah!
- Aha!
- But it's leaving in one minute.
- You get the tickets, I'll hold the plane.
Oh, good, good.
Two tickets to Albuquerque, please.
The white zone is for the immediate loading and unloading of passengers only.
- Oh, thank you.
- No parking.
The white zone is for the immediate loading and unloading of passengers only.
No parking.
The white zone is for the immediate loading and unloading of passengers only.
No parking.
- Hey, what's your hurry?
- Come on, over there, you jackass!
Officer, those men are bad!
Hold it right there!
Hold it!
Come back here!
I swear to you, she'll be here any second.
Her ivy got caught in the luggage rack.
Sandy, where are you?
She's a sick woman.
She's gotta get on this plane.
There's a kidney in Kansas City that's not gettin' any fresher.
Sandy!
Excuse me.
Look out.
Wait, Sandy.
Sandy.
- Here you go.
- Hold up there!
- Anyone care for some money?
- Money!
Money!
What have you done?
Oh, my God!
- That's all our money.
What are you doing?
- Hey!
Hey!
Albuquerque, honey, Albuquerque.
Thanks.
I gotta get on that plane!
I sell cars in Albuquerque.
Give us a call if you can.
- Wanna apprehend?
- No.
We'll pick up surveillance.
I had this old Cadillac, see?
We couldn't get rid of it.
I said, what the hell...
Oh, my God, there they are.
- And I played it big.
No use playing it little.
I'm just sorry it was so...
- Look.
Fan out.
- Why don't you get your car the same colour as your...
- Come on.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, where you gals scootin' off to, huh?
- Panansky!
- Bobby, this way!
Ow!
Hey, buddy!
Hey, where do you think you're...
Throw something.
Go!
And I thought coach was bad.
Panansky!
Panansky!
Excuse me.
Sir.
- Has flight 501 arrived?
- Yes, ma'am.
Right there.
- Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Panansky!
Where's he going?
No, no, ladies.
You know better than this.
- You're right.
- That way.
- You're right, of course.
Thanks for your help.
Panansky!
Where the hell have you been?
- Michael!
- Michael!
- There he goes!
Wait!
No, no, wait!
Oh, no, no!
Oh!
Yes, okay.
- Hey!
Stop!
- Go through that next light!
Go through the yellow!
Through it!
You can take the bike back.
Michael and I will be spending the night in that motel we passed.
Dream on.
We'll be on a plane to Hawaii.
- I can't believe it.
- He's really in there.
Yeah.
What's the matter?
You afraid?
Why should I be?
Then why don't you go rushing into his... into his arms, huh?
Well, why don't you?
It's a long way to come to get bad news.
Yeah.
Well...
- Oh, God!
- Oh, I know.
- Let me see.
- Oh, no!
Oh!
- Rat woman!
Oh!
- Oh, it's not that bad.
- Oh, I'm...
- Oh, no!
- Could we share the mirror?
- Oh, Christ!
- What is it?
- I would be getting a zit.
I don't see anything.
There's nothing there.
- No?
- No.
You're worse than I am.
- At least you have eyelashes.
Geez.
- Oh, what do you want?
You're a natural blonde.
- And you tan.
- I want eyelashes.
- You make me sick.
Oh, natural?
You think this is natural?
"Oh, my dear, you too can have this colour."
- No shit?
It looks great.
- Oh, thanks.
It's just a rinse and a cellophane toner.
- Yeah?
- You want a Tic Tac?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
L...
Well, I'd say good luck, but...
Yeah.
- Whatever.
- Yeah, whatever.
Hello.
Michael, no!
You.
- Oh, Michael!
- Michael!
- He's all right.
- Oh!
Let's get him out of here.
- Michael?
Oh!
- Michael.
Oh!
Oh!
You're okay.
It's just a bump.
- Yeah.
- My God.
- Michael!
- Michael!
- I feel that we are entitled to an explanation here.
- What is your relationship with this woman?
- Did you make it with her?
Do you even know this person?
- That's why you're here?
- Yeah!
- Well...
I know you're in some sort of trouble, but I'd like to discuss this first.
- Please.
- Right now.
- W-Wait a minute. - Please?
- Oh, Michael.
Here.
- Darling, let me help you up.
- Oh!
Easy.
- You mean you did this on your own?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- There's nobody with you?
- No.
- He changed the subject.
Did you see how he did that?
- Yes, you did.
Now, look here, Michael, there's an issue at stake and I'm sorry, you're just not going to get out of it.
- How did you follow me here?
- L-l...
Well, we... we knew you weren't dead at the morgue.
- And you told them?
- Of course we told them.
We...
- Shit.
- Bad idea, huh?
Wait a minute.
You mean you wanted to be dead?
It would have been useful.
Russell, abort the rendezvous.
There's a chopper out there, and this could be trouble.
- Get out of here.
I'll meet you in Tres Crucas.
- Screw 'em.
You got the stuff.
No, we don't have the advantage here.
I'll meet you in Tres Crucas.
Acknowledge.
You're the boss.
Over and out.
Let's go.
You're not a schoolteacher, are you, Michael?
Michael, what's going on?
What's in Tres Crucas?
- I'm sorry you heard that.
- Who cares what I heard?
What was I to you?
- What was I?
- Convenient.
Moderately enjoyable... largely forgettable... and a lesson to me not to leave loose ends.
I can't go on.
I don't wanna go on.
Oh, Mother told me about men like this.
I hate it when she's right.
Oh, loose ends!
That's all I was to him?
A loose end?
What are you doing worrying about your love life going to shit?
We're gonna die!
That's comforting.
- Who the hell are they?
- Well, how am I supposed to know?
He's after Michael.
They're the good guys!
- Help us!
Take us!
- Down here!
Here!
Please!
Help us!
Down here!
Get into the light!
He won't go for us if we're in the light!
- But it won't hold still!
- It's moving too fast!
Sandy!
Oh!
Come on, Sandy!
Hurry!
Oh, how do they ever catch criminals?
- He's going to cut us off!
- I'll get you.
I'll get you!
Come on!
Looks like these ends are gonna stay loose just a little longer, you big shithead!
Come on!
Down here!
- Hello!
- Weldon?
Hello!
I guess you know Mr Atkins!
- Oh, my God!
- No, it's all right!
We're CIA!
CIA?
Uh, can I offer you ladies coffee, or, um, a Coke?
- Weldon!
- Weldon!
What is going on?
I'm not authorized to debrief you at...
You're not authorized to debrief me?
After I saved you from being throttled?
Weldon!
Who is Michael Santers?
He was one of our best.
Very high clearance.
Access to everything.
And then... we began to suspect that he was a double agent working for Korzenowski.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Korzenowski, our teacher?
Our teacher and, I'm sorry to tell you, a key undercover man for the Russians.
Oh, please!
The man has a reputation.
He was the definitive Lear.
He is the definitive KGB.
That's why I was in that class.
I was supposed to keep an eye on him, see if he and Santers were in contact.
- And they were?
- We still don't know how.
I never saw them come within a mile of each other.
But somehow Korzenowski hired him.
What did Michael do?
He stole the prototype of an experimental virus.
It's called floratoxin.
It's, uh, an airborne defoliant.
A few drops destroys all vegetation for hundreds and hundreds of square miles.
Like grass and trees a-and the... and the whole shot?
- As in California.
- Oh, my God.
- As in the entire wheat belt.
- He would do that?
All he has to do is spill a couple of drops, and the wind'll do the rest.
Don't try to bargain with me.
I want $20 million cash.
And please don't insult my intelligence by trying to mark it.
All right.
Only it's going to take a couple of hours.
Where are you?
Don't be ridiculous, Weldon.
They're his accomplices.
- Oh, please!
- They're professionals.
- Oh, no, sir!
- I believe them.
- What?
- You believe that a couple of two-bit actresses...
- Oh, I...
- Where are they taking me?
- Could have tracked down Michael Santers?
- Yes.
It was a rendezvous.
They helped him to escape.
I was there.
You remember?
Yeah, what did we know?
He was just some guy we happened to be boffing.
Damn it, I don't boff.
I have never boffed.
Okay, had sex with.
Is that white enough for you?
- Move it.
- Sir, if you'll just go over their statements...
That's what I intend to do at Fort Morgan in a nice underground cell until we get Santers' whereabouts.
You want to know his whereabouts?
Fine.
He said he was going to Tres Crucas, New Mexico.
That's a little bit too easy, isn't it?
Get in the van!
That's a little bit too easy, isn't it?
Get in the van!
Okay, okay, here's an idea.
Why don't we all go to Tres Crucas and see if Michael is there?
I'll prove it to you.
I kn...
I know, I know.
Your head hurts, and it's our fault.
I understand that.
- But if you'd only identified yourself...
- Oh, I see.
- You want me to walk up to enemy operatives and hand over...
- Oh, come on!
- Ah, who's an enemy operative?
- Hey, Steve, why the hell are we slowing down?
- Wait just a...
Who the hell are you?
Oh, my God!
Some of us who teach can also do.
What do you want?
- Where is Michael Santers?
- Hey, you should know.
You're the ones he's working for.
This is last time I will ask you.
Where is Michael Santers?
Come on, come on, come on!
Go.
Go!
I think you'll stay.
I never died better, did I, teach?
Okay, let's go up, real easy.
That a boy.
That a boy.
Yeah, you're a good actor, but a lousy shot.
Please, look, we can make bargain.
- Uh, the KGB is very generous.
- Oh...
Oh, stop with the KGB.
How dare you defraud the entire New York theatre community?
- Lauren.
- I've never...
Hi.
- Lauren.
- I've never heard such behaviour in my life.
- Lauren.
- These people are artists.
- Lauren.
- What is it?
- Th-That's not the hot issue here.
The...
No.
No.
Okay.
Okay, here it comes, Stan.
You're gonna tell us right now what was going on in that class... or Sandy's gonna shoot you.
I'll shoot it off, Stan.
We needed couriers.
- How?
- Yeah.
- Uh... your notebooks.
I left microdot for him in yours, and he sent back reply in yours.
Well, if he stole the toxin for you, why don't you have it?
He screwed you too.
He screwed me too.
Ladies, I admit I've made a big mistake, but if you'd just put yourself in my hands... you can walk away from here right now with full federal protection.
Complete clearance of all conspiracy charges.
I will give you free acting lessons for the rest of your life.
- We'll pay all the expenses you've incurred.
- Oh, stop it.
The both of you, you're so full of it.
Come on, let's go.
It stinks around here.
Thanks for trying.
- We'll find you.
- Not if the coyotes find you first!
- Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, oh, oh.
- Please!
Please!
Blood is on your head, you putz.
- This is the worst day of my life.
- Yeah.
- We're a couple of chumps.
You know that, don't you?
- Oh, we're worse than that.
- Mmm, well, okay, yeah.
- I can't believe I didn't see it.
- I am so humiliated.
- I know.
He hit on us for those notebooks.
"Hit on"?
He got me to pick him up.
Tell me!
I attacked him in a Burger King.
I worked all night on his fucking pumpkin costume.
- For a mythical student, if you will.
- No!
- Yes!
- No.
Hey, I baked cookies for his entire class.
- Oh, no!
- Could you see me baking?
Icing...
Icing these little happy faces on every one of'em?
Well, I paid $5,000 to study with the KGB.
The KGB.
Oh, my God!
Oh, he trashed me much worse than he trashed you.
- Oh!
- Really.
Hamlet.
How am I gonna know Hamlet?
You really should if you're going to be an actress.
Oh, pardon me... but, you know, we can't all of us study at the London School of Shakespearean Weirdness, you know.
Some of us had to schlepp drinks for a living.
I'm sorry, Sandy.
Oh, God.
So, where you wanna go now?
I don't know.
They'll be after us.
- I was thinking...
- Yeah.
So was I.
What?
That we go find Michael and rip his face off.
- That, and get the toxin back.
- Oh, the hell with the toxin.
- I just wanna rip his face off.
- No, we need the toxin.
We don't want the CIA on our backs all our lives.
- Just so I get to rip his face off.
- I promise we'll rip his face off after we get the toxin.
Hey!
Hello, honey!
Hello!
No, no, you idiot!
My shoes!
- Hey, Stan.
- What?
Looks like you're gonna be facing KGB tribunals.
Unless, of course, you'd like to make an arrangement.
Would such an arrangement include, uh, unlimited expense account?
Condo on the Potomac?
Redskins season tickets?
Huh?
Aw, nuts!
Thanks, Humphrey.
It was sweet of you.
Oh, it was my pleasure, Lauren.
Well, what should we do first?
Get a little sushi?
Take in a show?
Now, why do they do that?
Has there ever been one woman in the history of the world who actually said...
"Yes, fellas, please, take me now."
For a bed and a bath, I'd...
I'd consider it.
- Bite your tongue.
- Hey, turisto.
Welcome.
Hey, you're lookin' for a guide, right?
Native Indian to show you the hidden wonders of this great Chicatacawa nation?
Well, ladies, you have found him.
Special price, today only... $20.
I don't want to be the first to break this to you... you are not an Indian.
That's a technicality.
I've been a blood brother to the Chicatacawa since 1968.
I got a tan.
What do you want for $20?
Honey, I'm an actress.
I love to dress up and pretend.
And the hat is fabulous.
But what we need right now is to find a man.
Well, okay, but it's not gonna be that great.
- I'm a little bombed.
- What?
And it's still $20.
No.
No, no.
No, no, no.
- We're looking for a specific man...
- So we can kill him.
Oh, then you need a witness.
Hey, I'll stand up for you in court.
I saw the whole thing.
It was an accident.
The axe slipped out of your hand.
It's a wonderful scenario.
When we find the guy, we're gonna let you know.
- Thanks.
- Find him?
Find as in "locate"? "Track down"?
Hey, now we are rollin'.
We have hit the nail right on the hammer.
I'm a tracker.
That's my vocation... a tracker.
A guy who tracks down other guys.
That's my main gig!
Genuine Indian shit.
- What do you think?
- He's a bum.
But he might have good instincts.
Should we ask for references?
Hey, you wanna find this guy or not?
- Ah, ancient Indian techniques.
- Oh, those could be anybody's.
Yeah, they could...
anybody about 185 pounds... dragging his right leg a little like it's injured.
And... smoking one hand-rolled Colton's... every three minutes.
Admit it.
The man is cool.
- Yeah, come on.
- Oh, baby.
Yeah, why you do this to me, huh?
Oh, my God.
Wow!
That is some major ill repute happening there.
- Come on, let's go.
- No, no, don't try it.
You'll never get past Gert.
It's customers only.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Come on.
Hey.
- Let's go, will ya.
Come on.
- Customers?
Customers!
You get his shirt, I'll get his pants.
What?
Come on!
You had your chance at me, and you lost it.
Come on, now!
- Oh, I want the hat.
- Will you stop it!
Who do you think you're kiddin', huh?
How old are you boys?
Thirteen?
Fourteen?
Hell, you're just babies.
Why, you can't even shave yet.
- Your daddy know you're here?
- Hell, yes.
He told us where to come.
Come.
Get it?
Oh.
First time.
Oh, no way!
- It's his first time.
- What'd you tell her that fer?
- You chickenshit, huh?
- I ain't!
I done it plenty!
- You chickenshit.
You chickenshit.
- Oh, you always tell my secrets.
I'm gonna get you.
Chickenshit...
Oh, lordy, don't do that.
That ain't no way to act in a whorehouse.
Be a man.
Be a man!
This is Tina and Maria.
Have fun.
Yeah, now tell me how we're gonna get it up.
Definitely not.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
- He's there.
- "Oh, God, oh, God."
- Won't be long now.
- Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God!
Oh...
Oh, God!
- That was it.
- He'll be asleep in three seconds.
Did you ever think you'd be glad men roll over and pass out?
- Okay?
- You've gotta be...
Have a nice day.
- I've come to a definite conclusion.
- What's that?
You can have him.
Oh, God.
Was it good for you too?
H-H-Hurry!
Hey, baby!
Help me up!
You guys are the sweetest, most gorgeous creatures.
You're sweet.
Yikes!
- Hey, wait a minute.
Guys!
- Wait a minute.
We're not supposed to stop.
Why...
Why are we stopping?
Why did we stop?
- Oh.
Sorry.
- Uh, w-we have to get to a phone.
- Yeah, uh, uh, phone.
- We have to...
Oh, God.
- Phone.
Phone.
- Oh, my God.
- What are you doing here?
- Trying to get back to the reservation... before one of these guys hits on me for my phone number.
- Oh, come on, you don't look so bad.
- Except for prints don't work for him.
He should stick with solids.
- Wait a minute.
Did he say phone?
- Phone!
- Frank!
- Leave me alone!
- Frank, you have to listen!
- No, I don't!
- Yes, you do!
- Oh!
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
- Oh.
- I'm sorry, Frank, but this is really important.
- Oh, leave me alone.
- Just leave me alone!
- Look, we gotta use your phone.
Forget it!
You stiffed me for $20.
You leave me in drag.
You got some maniac with a knife chasing you.
These things do not tempt me to wanna team up with you guys.
- Ah, what's wrong with my head?
- Are you okay?
No!
I think I'm gettin' sober!
Look, listen, Frank, we're not just jerking you around.
Some guys are chasing us 'cause one of them stole a virus... that's gonna kill and destroy all the plants and all the trees for thousands of miles all the way around.
We stole it back, so now they're trying to kill us.
You get it?
Jesus, the '60s were good to you, weren't they?
Frank, that's right.
Think back to the '60s.
- People did things for each other.
- They were wasted.
Listen, Frankie, get us to a telephone, all right?
I swear to you, you're gonna be showered with money.
Showered with money.
Okay, ladies, this is it.
This is it, Frank?
It's not exactly the hub of the reservation, is it?
- Hey, it's off season.
What do you want?
- We wanna use the phone, Frank.
Hey, five minutes.
That's it.
If you guys stay more than five minutes, you'll bring down a goddam tornado.
We have no intention of hanging around.
- Fine.
- I just wanna make this call...
I must have that blouse!
- That shirt has my name on it.
- Oh!
Oh, I love this.
- I wore one of these when I did Oklahoma.
- Oh, that'll be cute on you.
- You think?
Not too short-waisted?
- No!
You get a little snakeskin belt, give it a little texture.
- Oh, that's a good idea.
I like this too.
- Hey!
Will ya?
Come on, now.
Just take the blouse.
Keep 'em.
They're on the house.
- Now, you gotta make this phone call.
- Oh, thanks, Frank.
- Get on the phone, and let's get going here.
Right.
Right, right, right.
Okay, who are we gonna call?
The New York Times.
Huh?
- No.
We'll call the president.
- Oh, yeah!
That's really a call he's gonna take.
"Hi, we're two struggling actresses.
We're saving the world." Get real.
He was an actor.
Okay, the FBI.
We're gonna call the FBI, we're gonna turn this in, we're gonna save our country.
Uh-huh.
Do you have a changing room?
This doesn't work.
They must have cut me off.
- I owe 'em a little money.
- Don't you know how to deal with those dorks?
- You don't have to pay them anything.
- You don't?
- No, all you have to do...
- No!
- What?
No, not that again.
Frank, how do we get to a phone that works?
Frank, how do we get to a phone that works?
Okay, ladies, this here's Frodo.
He'll take real good care of ya.
Now, you're gonna ride across those hills till you come to the edge of a cliff.
Don't go off there.
That's a 700-foot drop.
Now, if you do get down, you're gonna come to the rattlesnake area.
Be real careful goin' through there.
Now, take a left at the rattlesnakes and you'll come around to a dirt road.
Take you right into the taco stand.
They got a phone in there.
Huh?
It couldn't be just a block and a half to the corner store, Frank?
Not around here.
- Hey, Frank, thanks.
- Oh, okay, all right.
- Now, come on, we gotta...
- We won't forget you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- We're gonna see you get something out of this, Frank.
- Oh, yeah, sure.
I'll be showered with money.
I can hardly wait.
Come on, let's get outta here.
- Come on.
- Wait, wait, wait.
I don't have the toxin.
- Wait a minute.
- Oh, hold on a second there.
Give me the vial.
Slowly.
- Let go of me!
- Go!
Whoa!
Asshole!
Come on!
Well, of course.
Russell!
Boyd!
- Where's the other one?
- She got away.
- Now you're gonna make yourself useful.
- I don't know how to drive a stick shift.
- Get in the back.
- Oh.
Let's turn around, okay?
Let's just go this way.
Holy shit.
Go away!
- Frank?
- Go away!
- What happened?
Where's Lauren?
- They took her.
- We gotta go find her.
- Oh, no!
Frank, I can't track her without you.
Now, please, come on!
- You go!
I'm busy bleeding!
- Frank!
You don't give up, do ya?
You think I'm gonna go chasing a pack of psychos for some dumb blonde?
She's not dumb, and she's not a blonde.
- Well, good luck, lady.
- Frank!
Frank!
Okay, okay, the truth.
Lauren and I pulled a bank job.
Those guys were feds, and Lauren buried the money...
- Spare me, will ya?
- Well, what about revenge?
I mean, these guys trashed your house.
Don't you want to get even?
I'm insured.
No deductible.
Save your breath.
I'm running out of bullshit, Frank.
They're gonna kill her.
I know it's not your problem... but this person and I, we've been through a lot of disgusting things together.
This person and I are...
This person's a friend... and I don't have that many friends.
I do.
I do.
Hello, Michael.
This is Atkins.
Hello, Joe.
Do you have the money?
Yep, it's here.
Fine.
Here it is.
You'll get into the chopper and fly to Mesa Azul Cliffs at the Four Fingers.
Don't even think about ground support because I've got lookouts.
Now, if I see a plane, a tank, a chopper other than your chopper...
I'll get very nervous and I'm gonna dump this stuff in the first stiff wind blowing east.
You got it?
You will not land the chopper.
You'll come level with the mesa and you'll lower the money down to me... at 5.:00 p.m. Exactly.
And now you're gonna make the exchange.
I knew you wouldn't keep your end of the bargain.
This is your big moment.
Don't you wanna do it yourself?
Atkins is a crack shot.
Like I said, I'm doing the exchange.
- I see somebody.
It's Lauren.
- Now you wanna tell me how much you believe them?
No, don't shoot.
Sir, she's being coerced.
- Will you land this damn thing!
- He's trying!
Throw down the bag.
- Throw it down.
- You'll shoot me.
I'm really sorry about this.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
- Aren't you dead yet?
- Not till I play Hamlet.
- Boy!
- Oh, you came back.
- Sure!
- I can't believe it.
- And look at you.
You made off with the works.
- Yes.
- I got the toxin and $20 million.
- Wow!
This time I...
l-I think I'll hold the money.
- You don't mind.
- Oh, look, there's Weldon.
Maybe we can hitch a ride with those guys.
Hey, handsome!
- Go!
Go!
- Go where?
I will never... date a man again.
- Sandy.
- Getting laid just isn't worth it.
Oh, Sandy!
Get it!
Get it!
Pull!
Pull!
Oh!
There is no God.
- Hey, look!
- Hey, look!
Yes.
Let's go.
- Let's go.
- Oh, fuck.
You son of a bitch!
En garde!
- Yes!
- Go!
- Where is it?
Shit.
- I don't have it!
I have it.
Let her go.
No!
You...
Shit.
Ah, nuts.
Oh, shit!
Nine years of ballet, asshole!
You did it!
You did it!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
That is the best Hamlet ever.
Except for mine.
Wow!
Yeah!
Oh, this is the happiest moment of my life.
- They bought that shit.
- Sh... "Shit"?
You're calling my Hamlet shit?
He's a wimp.
I mean, look at him.
He can't make up his mind about anything.
He stands around all night and says, "What'll I do?
What'll I do?
What'll I do?"
Give me Romeo or Henry the Fifth.
Now, there's a guy I could boff.
Boff?
Oh, we're back to boffing, are we?
- I see.
That's...
That's the criteria for your great...
- Absolutely!
Right, whether you would boff the hero.
Well, who will you go to
When there's no one to betray
And I said
Who will you go to
When your best friend turns away
Hey, hey
Last time you're gonna let me down
Last time you're gonna fool around with me
It's the last time
Last time you're gonna let me down
Last time you're gonna fool around with me
It's the last time, baby
Last time you're gonna let me down
Last time you're gonna fool around with me
It's the last time
Last time you're gonna let me down
Last time you're gonna fool around with me
It's the last time, baby
There's a garden full of roses
There's a necklace full of pearls
You have come to take the roses
To give to other girls
Well, I'm just a pretty thing
You wanted for a day
There is nothing left between us
There is nothing left to say
Hey, hey
Last time you're gonna let me down
Last time you're gonna fool around with me
Last time you're gonna let me down
Last time you're gonna fool around with me
It's the last time
I just met you
Yet I'm feeling
It seems that somehow we met somewhere before
I think I loved you
In my dreams 100 times or maybe more
What a connection
I just can't conceal it
There's a kind of magic in the air
Ooh, I can feel it
Something special
Is gonna happen tonight
I want you to know that
Something special
Is gonna happen tonight
I promise I'll be good to you
What a connection
I just can't conceal it
There's a kind of magic in the air
Ooh, I can feel it
Something special
Is gonna happen tonight
I want you to know that
Something special
Is gonna happen tonight
I promise I'll be good to you
Something special
Is gonna happen tonight
Oh!
All right.
That's it.
- What's the matter, Marie?
What happened?
- She tried to kill me.
- Well, isn't that the point?
- No, Lauren.
This is theatrical fencing.
This isn't an autopsy.
All right?
All right.
Damn it!
I don't even know why we have to do this.
If you want to do Shakespeare, Shakespearean people have duels.
- Not the women.
- It's my ambition to play Hamlet.
Oh, that'll pack 'em in the aisles.
Yes.
Paulette.
Lan.
Good.
Lauren.
Excellent.
Naomi.
Bitch.
- Lauren.
- Hi, George.
- Have dinner with me tonight.
- What?
- Say, "Yes."
- George.
- Say, "Yes."
- Why are you acting like this?
Because I wanna be with you.
Well, that's nice.
This is so funny, George.
I thought you were gay.
Oh, I am.
It's just, I play so many heterosexual roles...
I feel I really need to do some serious research.
Mm-hmm.
And just when you think there's no greater depth... to which an actor could possibly sink.
- That's nothin'.
Remember Fred?
- Fred.
I've got a 50 percent hearing loss in this ear... from him yelling "Stella" in bed.
I tell ya, I swore off actors a year ago.
I said if that's the only subspecies of men available...
I'd rather not date at all.
And I haven't.
But there are other things.
My work, I perfect my craft.
L...
Kor...
Korzenowski!
- Yeah.
- He's taking students.
- Hey, but where you gonna get that kind of money?
- L...
I gotta use that phone.
Come on.
You're up.
Who is it?
It's your sister-in-law.
Hurry up.
My feet are falling off.
Well, hi, Shirley.
I'm glad you finally...
Wait a minute.
Get in front of the camera.
- I knew it.
- Come on, Mom.
Let me in.
No, we can't afford it.
Mom, please.
- Is that my baby?
- Daddy!
Yes, but she can't come in.
She wants a loan.
Daddy, can I come in, please?
Please, please, please, please, please, Daddy?
Daddy?
- Daniel, what are you doing?
- Oh, yes.
- You don't know she wants money.
- Of course she does.
- You don't know that.
- That's right, Mom.
Can't I just drop in to see my parents?
Okay, I need $5,000.
- But it's to study with Korzenowski. - $5,000.
- She might have a good reason.
- Daddy!
Stanislav Korzenowski.
- $5,000, Daniel.
- I'll pay you back.
- What did you say?
W
- What was that?
- I know I owe you some money.
- You owe us $3 2,000.
But it's the Korzenowski.
Lauren, we sent you to Yale and London and the institute.
You have been at this acting thing for years, and you haven't earned a dime.
You are still working as a salesgirl!
- Honey, face it.
Maybe it's time for you to give it up.
- Daddy.
- Daniel.
Hey, what did you do?
- Oh.
Oh, Daddy.
- Nothing.
- You gave her that money?
- Oh, Daddy.
- I cannot believe that you did that.
- She is our only child.
- Oh.
Oh, Daddy!
- I can't believe it.
She is sucking us dry.
- $5,000.
Thank you, Daddy!
- She isn't.
Well, I just got another bill from Bloomingdale's.
- Oh, thank you.
- Drop that now.
Don't you dare start talking about that.
Give me back my fuckin' quarter!
Damn!
Well, good luck.
I'm Lauren Ames.
There's my application, your board, your pen.
- Thank you.
- And my down payment.
Keep that for now.
You still have to audition.
- Right.
- Sit down.
Mr Korzenowski will call you.
Thank you.
You nervous?
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
- I mean, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
It's okay.
No, I'm...
I'm not...
It's fine.
I guess we're all a little bit, uh...
Don't talk.
Right.
Oh, boy.
I don't blame you.
This is so intense.
Shut up, Weldon.
- I'm sorry.
Sorry.
- Holy Mary!
Isn't there one fucking phone in this whole town that works?
You got a phone I can use?
Yeah, hi.
This is Sandy Brozinsky.
Who's this?
Howie.
Okay, Howie.
I'm holding in my hand this thingee... says you're gonna turn off my phone at noon.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I wanna tell you somethin'.
I just got out of the hospital.
I get home after two months of intensive care... they wheel me into my building, I open my mailbox...
I find your thingee screaming at me I have till 12 noon today...
Hey, no, you listen.
You listen!
I just opened the damn thing.
I just now laid eyes on it for the first time.
What was I supposed to do?
Have 'em unhook the life-support machine so I could pay my bills?
Oh, really?
Yeah, so now I have three...
No, make that two minutes... to write a check and wheel myself down to your office?
Howie, is that the drill?
24 hours?
24 big ones?
All right, Howie.
You're a prince among men.
I mean it.
I wanna have your child.
Yeah, bye.
No, stop!
Please, do not screech at anyone else.
I am trying to prepare for an audition here.
Thank you.
Oh, yeah?
What for?
A workshop with Stanislav Korzenowski.
Who's that?
Only one of the great geniuses of the theatre.
Now if you don't mind.
Hey, maybe I should audition for him too.
I'm an actress.
Hey, no, I'm a pro.
I bet I'm more of a pro than you.
Uh-huh.
Well, I just made 2,500 bucks doin' a movie, yeah.
That's where I've seen you.
It has been driving me crazy.
- You saw Ninja Vixens?
- I, uh, must have.
Huh.
Well, this whole acting thing's been goin' pretty good.
I mean, it's all just bullshittin', right?
Actors are just bullshitters who get paid.
Where do I sign up?
Just exactly what do you think you're going to do in there?
I don't know.
I'll make somethin' up.
You're going in to Stanislav Korzenowski and wing it?
Jesus, you'd think I was gonna go in and pee on him.
Listen to me.
You do not audition for a man of Korzenowski's reputation... without a prepared classical monologue.
That means Shaw, Ibsen, Shakespeare.
I'm doing Ophelia's mad scene.
I'm not waltzing in off the street... saying, "Gee, I think I wanna be an actress."
You know what I bet?
I bet you haven't been laid in about a year.
- Ames, Lauren.
- Ah, ah.
Yes, I'm coming.
I'm...
I'm...
I will be co...
I'm...
I'm...
I'm ready.
I'm...
I'm...
- I'm ready.
- Quickly, Miss Ames.
I have a good mad scene.
It's really great.
I just saw it.
Hmm.
I will not only wish you to absorb everything that I say.
I will also wish you to keep notes of everything that I say.
And I will wish to look at those notes.
Now if you say this is like high school...
I do not apologize.
I am an old egotist... and I want to know that you record my ideas.
If you do not, you're gone from the class.
All right.
We begin.
We begin with vowel groups.
Vowel groups.
Mr Weldon... do you know the difference between a Texas diphthong... and a Georgia diphthong?
Sorry I'm late.
They made me fill out all these dumb-ass financial aid forms.
You want 'em?
You want 'em?
I cannot believe...
I absolutely cannot believe he let her in!
And on scholarship!
I just bet I know what she did as an audition.
The woman has no training, no experience.
I mean, correct me if I'm wrong.
I really thought if you worked at your craft, maybe... just possibly, you'd get to work with one of the greats.
It's $2.95, not $295.
I knew that.
Something's seriously wrong with my life.
Excuse me.
- Are you all right?
- Better.
L-I w...
I was just, um...
- Who cares?
May I help you?
- Yeah.
- Have you got something in a pumpkin?
- The shade pumpkin?
- No, a pumpkin costume.
- Oh.
God, I sound like an idiot.
The reason is that I teach grammar school.
- You're a schoolteacher?
- Uh-huh.
- You're not an actor?
- Oh, God, no.
I'd be awful.
Why do you ask?
Oh, well, there's just so many actors who come in here.
Please go on.
Well, we're putting on a little pageant... and there's a kid in my class who's very insecure.
You know, the other kids pick on him and his mother doesn't sew... and I think it would give him such a boost... to have the best darn costume in the place.
So I thought a professional costumers would have an incredible pumpkin.
But I can't go more than $50... because this is coming out of my own pocket.
I'm really sorry.
I don't think we have a pumpkin.
What about a squash?
We don't have any vegetables as such.
I'm sorry.
Well, this is the last place on the list.
But I'll just throw something together myself, huh?
I really appreciate your time.
Thanks.
Um, uh, listen.
I don't know, maybe, uh, maybe someone...
Maybe I could, uh...
I've made a lot of my own costumes.
I'm sure it wouldn't be that difficult.
If I could help out, I'd... like to.
That would be fabulous.
- I hope you'll forgive me, Lauren.
- For what?
L...
I don't usually lunge at women like that.
- Oh.
- But you just, uh...
I just had to kiss you.
L-I really am sorry and I hope that you'll want to see me again.
Oh, where in the world did you come from?
- New Mexico, originally.
- No, no, I mean... how can a man so delightful as you... be just wandering the streets of New York?
Single, single, yeah.
I can't believe it.
Well, that's not by choice.
I'd like to be married.
- This isn't happening.
- Why not?
Well, there must be something wrong with you.
Don't you have any faults?
I smoke.
You smoke?
That's it?
Call the police!
No, no, no.
It's an addiction.
Colton's tobacco.
New Mexico's finest.
I hope you don't mind.
Well, I'll struggle through somehow.
Good.
Very good.
Because, uh, I'd like to see you again... tomorrow night.
Well, yes.
Mmm, thank you.
What's this?
"Ooh, eee, ooh, ah, ooh, eee, ah, ooh."
- That's what you do in acting class?
- Those are vowel groups.
Mmm, sorry. "Wowel" groups.
- Ooh. - Ooh.
- Ooh.
- Ooh, I feel the same way.
- Ooh, ooh.
Will you please kiss me hard on the lips?
That was tender, but tasty.
- Bite my face.
- Okay.
Bite my leg.
Now bite my other leg.
- You get her two 1 X legs and...
- Going over the fence gymnastics?
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, my.
That kind of evening, huh?
Not the kind you're used to.
No money changed hands.
No, no, no, no.
Reveal, reveal.
You have killed your father.
You have married your mother.
Na, no words, remember.
Na, reveal.
Here we have a sick sea lion.
Go.
- Miss Brozinsky.
- Okay.
You will now perform for us, also without words...
Hamlet's soliloquy.
Who's that?
Hamlet.
Hamlet.
Shakespeare's tragedy of Hamlet.
Ah, well.
Uh, for her, we get the comic book, huh?
Taxi!
Hey!
Hey!
Oh.
Ooh, that creep Korzenowski is driving me nuts.
Ooh.
I know what I need.
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Ooh.
To die on the stage... is perhaps the greatest single challenge... an actor can face.
The audience must know, must absolutely believe... that the breath, that the very life... is going out of your body.
Now...
You!
You will die now, please.
No, no, I don't believe you.
Maintain your focus.
Na, I don't believe you.
- Maintain your focus and lean forward.
- Stop, stop, stop.
Stop it.
Stop it.
- Are you all right?
- Fine.
Perhaps you would like to die for us now, Miss Ames.
You, I think, I will shoot.
You will feel the bullet enter your body.
You will lose all muscle control.
You will fall down dead.
Bang.
This can only be the achievement... of years of training.
No other way would we ever see so false a performance.
So mechanical, so thought-out.
Never for one moment truly felt.
Here, you must reach deep inside yourself.
You must go beyond the safety of what you know.
We know you can act, Camille... but can you be a person of flesh and blood?
Ah, time.
We die again tomorrow.
And, uh, please, give me your notebooks.
I wish to see them.
You can't walk there!
Hey, Ed, you want the delivery or not?
The man is a Nazi.
I have never been the dumbest in any class before.
I haven't seen you for nine hours.
Taxi!
Taxi!
Mmm.
- You know what today is?
- No.
It's our third-week anniversary.
- Stop on the next corner.
- You got it.
- I think you need some roses.
- Oh, no, no, you can't afford any more flowers.
- Right here.
- No, don't stop.
- Half...
Half a dozen.
- No, don't stop.
I know what teachers make.
Don't stop.
Michael!
A crowd is gathered here.
Traffic is backed up for two blocks.
Killed in the explosion are Lee Veran, the owner of the flower shop... and Michael Santers, a teacher at Holmes Elementary School.
Two terrorist groups have claimed responsibility for the blast.
It's all right, Miss Ames.
We've got a positive ID from his wallet.
You don't have to see him.
I want to see him.
I warn you, there's very little left to see.
Particularly in the, uh, upper body region.
I wanna see him.
I'm very sorry you feel a need to do this.
Just leave me alone with him, please.
What are you doing here?
- Me?
What the fuck are you doing here?
- I beg your pardon.
- I am in mourning.
- Well, so am I!
- For my lover.
- Well, so am I!
- Who?
- Michael Santers.
- No, no, you little witch!
No!
- You bitch, you didn't know him!
- Oh, he loved me.
- How could you lie, little bitch?
- Oh, get away from me!
Oh!
- Get out of here right now!
- I'm gonna bitch-slap you!
I'm gonna break every bone in your body!
- Oh, you are?
- Oh, you are?
- Yes, I am!
How dare you!
How dare you!
- Oh.
Ooh.
- He loved me.
He loved me!
Loved you?
Loved you?
- Damn right he did!
- Ha, that's obscene.
No, that's reality, baby, 'cause no way did that guy give a shit about you!
I refuse to believe for one second that he would lower himself.
Oh, he lowered himself, all right.
This is all a lie.
You are psychotic.
Yes, that's right.
I've known from the first time I saw you sleaze into that office.
You lied to that phone man... you lied your way into the class and you're lying now.
- I'm gonna get you for this!
- Whoa!
Whoa, my...
Oh!
Well, what the hell?
- Well, that's not his...
- No way.
Look at that.
- It's too small.
- It's a fuckin' pencil.
- Where's the appendix scar?
- And that little mole?
It's somebody else!
He's alive!
He's alive!
He's a...
Well, thank you.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
This was my idea.
I don't care, I'm gonna handle this.
You don't have the dimmest, dullest notion how to handle this.
You can't just walk in and bluntly announce this kind of thing.
Thing, thing.
What kind of thing are you talking about?
You can't even say it.
You sure as hell can't tell 'em.
And just what do you think the response is going to be when you do?
You suggest...
You suggest...
You suggest that on the basis of this little nugget of testimony... we spend tax dollars on an investigation?
Have you been listening to us?
The man in the morgue could not possibly be Michael Santers.
All you have to do is look at his...
If you were to look... in the region...
If you were to look down.
Michael was not a guy other guys would have made fun of in a locker room, okay?
- I think he's got the big picture now.
- Well, I don't think he does.
This guy in the morgue, whoever he is... he's got, uh...
Does the phrase "needle dick..."
"the bug fucker," mean anything to you?
- I beg your pardon!
- You big lunkhead!
Now get outta here and don't come back.
The model of tact and decorum.
Oh, who gives a shit?
He wasn't gonna help us.
Well, of course not!
You sounded insane.
Oh, it is insane.
If he's alive, where is he?
He's probably back at my house, wondering' where the hell I am.
- Taxi!
- Your house?
- Taxi!
- Oh.
- Taxi!
- Wait a minute.
- W-W-Wait just a minute here.
- Come here!
Taxi!
I don't believe for one minute that he's at your apartment.
Oh, boy, are you gonna shit cement!
Taxi!
Taxi!
If Michael is anywhere, I assure you he is at my place.
- Taxi, taxi!
- Oh, you believe that?
I believe that he loved me, that he barely knew you.
And you're... you're fantasizing a relationship that is probably...
- an isolated, drunken encounter.
- Isolated?
Isolated?
Hey, this girl does not have one-night stands.
Every guy I have ever slept with... and we are way into double digits here, has come back for more.
Every single one!
- You wanna hit me, right?
- Oh, wouldn't I just love it.
- Okay, give it a try.
Give it a try.
Let's go, let's go.
Bob and weave, honey.
Bob and weave.
- Who dresses you anyway?
- Okay, okay.
Try it.
Okay.
Stand still, you little bitch.
I'm gonna bash your little WASP brains out.
I'm gonna hit you.
I'm gonna murder you.
- That's what I'm gonna do.
- Talk about dingbats.
They'll lead us right to him.
- Nine...
Nine years of ballet!
- You're too weird to hit.
- Taxi!
- Oh, taxi!
- Taxi!
- Taxi!
Taxi!
Well, now wait just a minute.
Wait just a...
All right, all right.
Okay, okay.
You insist Michael is at your apartment.
I think he's at mine.
So we'll go to both.
If he's at your place, which I doubt... then I will tell him goodbye and good riddance.
If on the other hand he's at mine... you will find yourself a nice biker and compare tattoos.
Oh!
You see, he's here.
Now don't make a scene.
Try to be adult about this.
- Oh, my God.
- Relax, it's just thieves.
Russian thieves?
He was here.
- Colton's?
- They're looking for Michael.
Let me see.
Hi, Mrs Hardy.
- Who are these morons?
- I don't know.
Stop!
Come back!
Oh, oh.
Oh, God.
- Oh, my God.
- Help me.
Come on!
Pretty baby.
- Oh!
- Put it down.
This isn't supposed to be up.
Oh, damn!
You messed up the thingee!
You crazy bastards.
Mr Atkins, these girls are bimbos.
They know nothing.
- What do we want 'em for?
- They know he survived.
They may know where he is.
We gotta get back on the trail.
So we're gonna cover every airport, every bus depot... every train station, every car rental out of this city.
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God.
Well, so much for your apartment.
You wanna try mine?
They've been here.
Oh, my God.
Wait a minute.
Nobody's been here.
This is normal.
- Come on.
Geez!
- Oh, no.
Michael?
Michael?
Michael?
Michael?
Mi...
- He's not here.
- I'm going to find him.
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.
- Where?
Well, he... he could be hiding, he could be hurt.
I don't know.
But I know that he needs me.
Now if you'll excuse me.
Where you gonna look?
His apartment?
You think he's gonna be hangin' out at his apartment, someone wants to kill him?
Oh, well, I'm not going to his apartment.
- Then where are you going?
- Isn't that my business?
Okay, look.
Hold it, okay?
All right, if you have an idea, you might as well tell me.
And we'll both go.
We'll go find him and we'll help him out of this.
And then we'll make him choose.
- Choose?
- Yeah.
- Between us?
- Yeah.
- I doubt that he'll know your name.
- Then we're on.
I mean, you're so goddam sure it's gonna be you, what do you care?
I'm confident, yes.
Well, so am I. So let's go.
- Good.
- Oh, wait.
I gotta fluff.
Could you fluff a little faster?
- What is that?
- I got it off a Christmas tree at Saks.
- You defiled a Christmas tree?
- No one saw.
What, nothing for the nose?
Oh, Lady Di, explain this to me.
The man's afraid for his life.
He's not gonna stop and buy tobacco.
Oh, you obviously didn't spend the kind of time with Michael that I did.
- He...
He couldn't last a day without his Colton's.
- I knew that.
Uh-huh.
Did you also know this is the only place in town that carries it?
- I didn't know that.
- No, no, you didn't.
Now, listen.
This time, let me handle this.
Your simplest exchanges with people become pornographic.
- That is a fucking lie.
- Need I say more.
Excuse me, sir.
Yeah, I know the guy.
Have you seen him?
Was he here today?
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe not.
When do you think you might arrive at a decision?
Uh, over a drink?
Mm-hmm.
Wouldn't you feel better, as a person... just unselfishly helping somebody find out something she really needs to know?
No.
How 'bout dinner?
- How 'bout a blow job?
- How 'bout a...
- What did you say?
- Right here.
Right now.
Both of us.
Kind of, uh, taking turns.
- He was in here this afternoon.
- This afternoon?
- You sure it was this afternoon?
- Yeah, right at my lunch break.
1:00.
He bought 10 pouches of Colton's.
- What else?
- Nothing.
He was kinda in a hurry.
He used the phone and then he ran right out of here.
He used the phone at 1:00?
Is that it?
That's all she wrote, baby.
Here or in the back?
I think I can take care of it from here.
Couple of floozies!
Oh, my God.
- That is the most disgusting, unscrup...
- What is your problem now?
Promising sexual favours?
That sends us back to the Dark Ages.
It's something you simply do not do!
You do if you're lying.
Besides, it worked.
Excuse me, but I must have missed something.
How exactly did it work?
We're at a dead end.
- You'll see.
- I'll see?
- Howie Rinker, please.
- Oh, Howie.
- How!
San!
- Great, how 'bout you?
- Hey, Frankie, wanna paper?
Yeah?
How's your fish?
Uh-huh.
What'd the vet say?
- What does a diseased fish have to...
- Stop it.
It's in the bag.
Listen, cutey.
Seeing as how you're my main man over at the phone company...
I wanna ask you just a teensy favour, all right?
Can you tell me what number was called out of Wally Frank Tobacconist at 1:00?
- This afternoon.
Yeah, yeah, I'll hold.
- This is good.
It's probably one of those guys with polyester pants and hips.
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Uh-huh.
- Good boy.
- All right.
That's a cab company, right?
Got it.
Oh, you're a catch, How.
Our kids are gonna be gorgeous, you know that?
- See you.
- Okay, don't gloat.
Taxi!
Is that all the money you walk around with?
Well, where's yours?
I thought you were the working pornographic actress.
I went to the Bahamas.
Hi.
Can you help me?
I, uh...
I'm such a ditz.
L-I left my, uh, tennis racket in one of your cabs today.
Uh, I was picked up around, uh, uh, 77th a-a-and Broadway... at 1:00.
- Is there a reward?
- Yes.
- No.
Ooh!
Ah!
What the hell is goin' on?
What the hell you gonna do to me, huh?
- What's wrong with you?
- Yo!
Dipstick!
There's your man.
What?
- Your turn.
- Come on, Rico.
Back to work.
- I don't wanna go back to work.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, I can't talk to him.
I went to a private school.
Hey, he looks like a prince.
He's gonna love you.
Hi.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about a fare... you might've had earlier in the day.
A very attractive Cauca-ca...
Just "person" will do nicely, won't it?
Why differentiate?
You would have picked him up, uh, right outside a little smoke shop.
Does that ring any bells of any kind?
Whatsoever?
Hello?
- Tall dude?
- Yes.
- Tweed coat?
Yes, yes.
A tweed coat, right.
I don't remember a thing.
- No, no, you just said a tall dude...
- I didn't say nothin'.
Oh, come on now.
Don't give me a big song and dance.
Oh, no.
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
- He's going to hurt us.
- What the hell is the matter with you?
Why should he help us with nothin' in it for him?
All right, you tell me.
What should I do?
You're an actress.
Bullshit him.
I don't use my training to tell lies to people.
Well, what do you use it for?
Geez, it's so simple.
Hey, how'd you like to make a quick 200 bucks?
- Say what?
- 200 bucks, cash... to take us to where you, uh, took the guy.
Are you out of your mind?
We don't have $200.
Ah, chill out, would ya?
Where are we?
We've been going for miles, and I haven't seen a single white person on the street.
There's one.
Oops, they got him.
That's not funny.
- Oh, my God.
- You sure this is it?
Hey, keep your pants on.
We're coming right out, all right?
Look, you know and I know I'm never gonna get another cab to come out here to Vietnam, cue ball.
So get real, all right?
All right, I'll give you 300 bucks.
Three hundred bucks just to sit here till we get back.
Three hundred?
You're a real pain in the ass.
You know that?
- Gonna break his neck.
I'm gonna break his neck.
- Beyond belief.
- You're really determined to have us killed, aren't you?
- Hey, get over yourself.
- He's not gonna kill us.
- Oh?
Why not?
- 'Cause we're gonna be raped and murdered in this building.
- Oh!
Oh!
Ohh.
Oh, no.
Oh.
Is that urine on the floor?
- What's a little urine?
- Freeze!
- Oh, my God, he's just a child.
- Well, at least rape's out.
Let me do this.
Do you really think you should be playing with your daddy's...
Shut up!
Where's your money?
Credit cards!
- Revoked.
Where do you think?
- Your bags.
- Throw 'em over here.
- Oh, I love this bag.
Ohh!
Oh!
Oh.
I'm not hit.
You little...
Give me that, you little thug.
- I'll be damned. - What?
- It's a fake.
- Oh.
- Where'd you get this?
- Santa.
Oh, yeah?
Well, if you want to see another Christmas, you're gonna have to help us find someone.
Shh.
- Come on, man, stop begging.
- This was a mistake.
Not any more.
Police!
You're under arrest!
Don't even think about it.
Don't even fuckin' think about it, or I'll blow your fuckin' nuts off!
Do we understand each other?
Okay, turn around.
Face the wall.
Do it.
Do it!
Do it!
Do it!
- Okay, frisk 'em.
- Frisk 'em?
Damn.
Busted by two broads.
Nice buns, boys.
You been working out?
Read 'em their rights.
You have... the right to remain silent... because anything you say can... and will be used against you.
You, uh...
Attorney.
You have, uh, you have the right to an attorney.
- Shit.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I heard it, I heard it.
Hey, look, look, what do you want?
You got it.
Just talk to me.
You know, he's right.
We could make you a real sweet deal, baby.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we heard it.
Wait a minute.
Maybe they can help us find Santers.
- They don't know Santers.
- Michael Santers?
The hell you say!
He was just here.
He was just here a few hours ago.
- Rat fixed him up with a passport.
- Ah, fuck you, Gilroy.
- What the fuck you want me to say?
- Oh, we're in the phoney ID business as well.
Ain't that nice?
- What name was the passport under?
- I wanna talk to a lawyer.
Oh, yeah?
It's gonna be kind of a short conversation.
They'll have to squeegee your brains off the wall.
Yeah.
You, uh, you better tell her the name.
- She's kinda cranky.
- Yeah.
I got my period.
- John Strauss.
- John Strauss.
- Where'd he go?
- Hey, look, he's leaving town.
That's all I know.
Hey, look, I'm bein' real nice here, huh?
Why don't you be nice and, uh, open that box on the table?
Go on.
- Now, look, why don't you just keep it?
- You givin' them the money?
- Forget that we ever met.
- Are you sick?
- Turn around!
- Yeah.
Happy to.
Well, I hate to give it to you, but that was pretty good.
Yeah, it was, it was.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, a deal's a deal.
And now, my man, we wanna go to the airport.
The airport.
- Eastern Airlines flight 501...
- They don't give out passenger lists.
- You have to be police or FBI.
- You are such a dip.
This is all the FBI we need.
His luggage was totally over the weight limit.
Can you imagine the gall, trying to bribe an airline official?
He offered me $ 100 to let it go through.
- Ah, what a world.
I tell ya.
- This is the final boarding call for Eastern Airlines flight 501...
- Watch and learn.
- To Albuquerque, now boarding at gate 4 2.
Excuse, please.
I was hoping you would to help me.
Uh... how... how do I to say?
You say it quickly.
I'm off in three minutes.
My father, he's coming here.
We...
No, I tell you from the beginning.
My name is Anna.
This is my sister Elona.
My half-sister.
She does not speak English.
My father, we have not seen him since we was babies in Prague.
He send us here in suitcase on train.
We, uh, escape, you see?
- No, I'm afraid I don't.
- Now we get letter.
He escape.
He is here.
But we do not know where.
We do not know which plane.
Could be any plane.
Please, you tell us which plane.
Please?
Absolutely not.
I'm sorry.
That was the single biggest crock...
I've ever had the privilege to hear in my 19 years at this airline.
I think that deserves something.
What was the name?
- Strauss.
John Strauss.
- John Strauss.
- Here we go.
- Uh-huh.
Flight 501 to Albuquerque.
- Looks like you just missed him.
- Oh, no!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
He took another line through St Louis, and it's delayed.
If I can put you on our flight 225 through Kansas City...
- you can beat him.
- Yeah!
- Aha!
- But it's leaving in one minute.
- You get the tickets, I'll hold the plane.
Oh, good, good.
Two tickets to Albuquerque, please.
The white zone is for the immediate loading and unloading of passengers only.
- Oh, thank you.
- No parking.
The white zone is for the immediate loading and unloading of passengers only.
No parking.
The white zone is for the immediate loading and unloading of passengers only.
No parking.
- Hey, what's your hurry?
- Come on, over there, you jackass!
Officer, those men are bad!
Hold it right there!
Hold it!
Come back here!
I swear to you, she'll be here any second.
Her ivy got caught in the luggage rack.
Sandy, where are you?
She's a sick woman.
She's gotta get on this plane.
There's a kidney in Kansas City that's not gettin' any fresher.
Sandy!
Excuse me.
Look out.
Wait, Sandy.
Sandy.
- Here you go.
- Hold up there!
- Anyone care for some money?
- Money!
Money!
What have you done?
Oh, my God!
- That's all our money.
What are you doing?
- Hey!
Hey!
Albuquerque, honey, Albuquerque.
Thanks.
I gotta get on that plane!
I sell cars in Albuquerque.
Give us a call if you can.
- Wanna apprehend?
- No.
We'll pick up surveillance.
I had this old Cadillac, see?
We couldn't get rid of it.
I said, what the hell...
Oh, my God, there they are.
- And I played it big.
No use playing it little.
I'm just sorry it was so...
- Look.
Fan out.
- Why don't you get your car the same colour as your...
- Come on.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, where you gals scootin' off to, huh?
- Panansky!
- Bobby, this way!
Ow!
Hey, buddy!
Hey, where do you think you're...
Throw something.
Go!
And I thought coach was bad.
Panansky!
Panansky!
Excuse me.
Sir.
- Has flight 501 arrived?
- Yes, ma'am.
Right there.
- Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Panansky!
Where's he going?
No, no, ladies.
You know better than this.
- You're right.
- That way.
- You're right, of course.
Thanks for your help.
Panansky!
Where the hell have you been?
- Michael!
- Michael!
- There he goes!
Wait!
No, no, wait!
Oh, no, no!
Oh!
Yes, okay.
- Hey!
Stop!
- Go through that next light!
Go through the yellow!
Through it!
You can take the bike back.
Michael and I will be spending the night in that motel we passed.
Dream on.
We'll be on a plane to Hawaii.
- I can't believe it.
- He's really in there.
Yeah.
What's the matter?
You afraid?
Why should I be?
Then why don't you go rushing into his... into his arms, huh?
Well, why don't you?
It's a long way to come to get bad news.
Yeah.
Well...
- Oh, God!
- Oh, I know.
- Let me see.
- Oh, no!
Oh!
- Rat woman!
Oh!
- Oh, it's not that bad.
- Oh, I'm...
- Oh, no!
- Could we share the mirror?
- Oh, Christ!
- What is it?
- I would be getting a zit.
I don't see anything.
There's nothing there.
- No?
- No.
You're worse than I am.
- At least you have eyelashes.
Geez.
- Oh, what do you want?
You're a natural blonde.
- And you tan.
- I want eyelashes.
- You make me sick.
Oh, natural?
You think this is natural?
"Oh, my dear, you too can have this colour."
- No shit?
It looks great.
- Oh, thanks.
It's just a rinse and a cellophane toner.
- Yeah?
- You want a Tic Tac?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
L...
Well, I'd say good luck, but...
Yeah.
- Whatever.
- Yeah, whatever.
Hello.
Michael, no!
You.
- Oh, Michael!
- Michael!
- He's all right.
- Oh!
Let's get him out of here.
- Michael?
Oh!
- Michael.
Oh!
Oh!
You're okay.
It's just a bump.
- Yeah.
- My God.
- Michael!
- Michael!
- I feel that we are entitled to an explanation here.
- What is your relationship with this woman?
- Did you make it with her?
Do you even know this person?
- That's why you're here?
- Yeah!
- Well...
I know you're in some sort of trouble, but I'd like to discuss this first.
- Please.
- Right now.
- W-Wait a minute. - Please?
- Oh, Michael.
Here.
- Darling, let me help you up.
- Oh!
Easy.
- You mean you did this on your own?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- There's nobody with you?
- No.
- He changed the subject.
Did you see how he did that?
- Yes, you did.
Now, look here, Michael, there's an issue at stake and I'm sorry, you're just not going to get out of it.
- How did you follow me here?
- L-l...
Well, we... we knew you weren't dead at the morgue.
- And you told them?
- Of course we told them.
We...
- Shit.
- Bad idea, huh?
Wait a minute.
You mean you wanted to be dead?
It would have been useful.
Russell, abort the rendezvous.
There's a chopper out there, and this could be trouble.
- Get out of here.
I'll meet you in Tres Crucas.
- Screw 'em.
You got the stuff.
No, we don't have the advantage here.
I'll meet you in Tres Crucas.
Acknowledge.
You're the boss.
Over and out.
Let's go.
You're not a schoolteacher, are you, Michael?
Michael, what's going on?
What's in Tres Crucas?
- I'm sorry you heard that.
- Who cares what I heard?
What was I to you?
- What was I?
- Convenient.
Moderately enjoyable... largely forgettable... and a lesson to me not to leave loose ends.
I can't go on.
I don't wanna go on.
Oh, Mother told me about men like this.
I hate it when she's right.
Oh, loose ends!
That's all I was to him?
A loose end?
What are you doing worrying about your love life going to shit?
We're gonna die!
That's comforting.
- Who the hell are they?
- Well, how am I supposed to know?
He's after Michael.
They're the good guys!
- Help us!
Take us!
- Down here!
Here!
Please!
Help us!
Down here!
Get into the light!
He won't go for us if we're in the light!
- But it won't hold still!
- It's moving too fast!
Sandy!
Oh!
Come on, Sandy!
Hurry!
Oh, how do they ever catch criminals?
- He's going to cut us off!
- I'll get you.
I'll get you!
Come on!
Looks like these ends are gonna stay loose just a little longer, you big shithead!
Come on!
Down here!
- Hello!
- Weldon?
Hello!
I guess you know Mr Atkins!
- Oh, my God!
- No, it's all right!
We're CIA!
CIA?
Uh, can I offer you ladies coffee, or, um, a Coke?
- Weldon!
- Weldon!
What is going on?
I'm not authorized to debrief you at...
You're not authorized to debrief me?
After I saved you from being throttled?
Weldon!
Who is Michael Santers?
He was one of our best.
Very high clearance.
Access to everything.
And then... we began to suspect that he was a double agent working for Korzenowski.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Korzenowski, our teacher?
Our teacher and, I'm sorry to tell you, a key undercover man for the Russians.
Oh, please!
The man has a reputation.
He was the definitive Lear.
He is the definitive KGB.
That's why I was in that class.
I was supposed to keep an eye on him, see if he and Santers were in contact.
- And they were?
- We still don't know how.
I never saw them come within a mile of each other.
But somehow Korzenowski hired him.
What did Michael do?
He stole the prototype of an experimental virus.
It's called floratoxin.
It's, uh, an airborne defoliant.
A few drops destroys all vegetation for hundreds and hundreds of square miles.
Like grass and trees a-and the... and the whole shot?
- As in California.
- Oh, my God.
- As in the entire wheat belt.
- He would do that?
All he has to do is spill a couple of drops, and the wind'll do the rest.
Don't try to bargain with me.
I want $20 million cash.
And please don't insult my intelligence by trying to mark it.
All right.
Only it's going to take a couple of hours.
Where are you?
Don't be ridiculous, Weldon.
They're his accomplices.
- Oh, please!
- They're professionals.
- Oh, no, sir!
- I believe them.
- What?
- You believe that a couple of two-bit actresses...
- Oh, I...
- Where are they taking me?
- Could have tracked down Michael Santers?
- Yes.
It was a rendezvous.
They helped him to escape.
I was there.
You remember?
Yeah, what did we know?
He was just some guy we happened to be boffing.
Damn it, I don't boff.
I have never boffed.
Okay, had sex with.
Is that white enough for you?
- Move it.
- Sir, if you'll just go over their statements...
That's what I intend to do at Fort Morgan in a nice underground cell until we get Santers' whereabouts.
You want to know his whereabouts?
Fine.
He said he was going to Tres Crucas, New Mexico.
That's a little bit too easy, isn't it?
Get in the van!
That's a little bit too easy, isn't it?
Get in the van!
Okay, okay, here's an idea.
Why don't we all go to Tres Crucas and see if Michael is there?
I'll prove it to you.
I kn...
I know, I know.
Your head hurts, and it's our fault.
I understand that.
- But if you'd only identified yourself...
- Oh, I see.
- You want me to walk up to enemy operatives and hand over...
- Oh, come on!
- Ah, who's an enemy operative?
- Hey, Steve, why the hell are we slowing down?
- Wait just a...
Who the hell are you?
Oh, my God!
Some of us who teach can also do.
What do you want?
- Where is Michael Santers?
- Hey, you should know.
You're the ones he's working for.
This is last time I will ask you.
Where is Michael Santers?
Come on, come on, come on!
Go.
Go!
I think you'll stay.
I never died better, did I, teach?
Okay, let's go up, real easy.
That a boy.
That a boy.
Yeah, you're a good actor, but a lousy shot.
Please, look, we can make bargain.
- Uh, the KGB is very generous.
- Oh...
Oh, stop with the KGB.
How dare you defraud the entire New York theatre community?
- Lauren.
- I've never...
Hi.
- Lauren.
- I've never heard such behaviour in my life.
- Lauren.
- These people are artists.
- Lauren.
- What is it?
- Th-That's not the hot issue here.
The...
No.
No.
Okay.
Okay, here it comes, Stan.
You're gonna tell us right now what was going on in that class... or Sandy's gonna shoot you.
I'll shoot it off, Stan.
We needed couriers.
- How?
- Yeah.
- Uh... your notebooks.
I left microdot for him in yours, and he sent back reply in yours.
Well, if he stole the toxin for you, why don't you have it?
He screwed you too.
He screwed me too.
Ladies, I admit I've made a big mistake, but if you'd just put yourself in my hands... you can walk away from here right now with full federal protection.
Complete clearance of all conspiracy charges.
I will give you free acting lessons for the rest of your life.
- We'll pay all the expenses you've incurred.
- Oh, stop it.
The both of you, you're so full of it.
Come on, let's go.
It stinks around here.
Thanks for trying.
- We'll find you.
- Not if the coyotes find you first!
- Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, oh, oh.
- Please!
Please!
Blood is on your head, you putz.
- This is the worst day of my life.
- Yeah.
- We're a couple of chumps.
You know that, don't you?
- Oh, we're worse than that.
- Mmm, well, okay, yeah.
- I can't believe I didn't see it.
- I am so humiliated.
- I know.
He hit on us for those notebooks.
"Hit on"?
He got me to pick him up.
Tell me!
I attacked him in a Burger King.
I worked all night on his fucking pumpkin costume.
- For a mythical student, if you will.
- No!
- Yes!
- No.
Hey, I baked cookies for his entire class.
- Oh, no!
- Could you see me baking?
Icing...
Icing these little happy faces on every one of'em?
Well, I paid $5,000 to study with the KGB.
The KGB.
Oh, my God!
Oh, he trashed me much worse than he trashed you.
- Oh!
- Really.
Hamlet.
How am I gonna know Hamlet?
You really should if you're going to be an actress.
Oh, pardon me... but, you know, we can't all of us study at the London School of Shakespearean Weirdness, you know.
Some of us had to schlepp drinks for a living.
I'm sorry, Sandy.
Oh, God.
So, where you wanna go now?
I don't know.
They'll be after us.
- I was thinking...
- Yeah.
So was I.
What?
That we go find Michael and rip his face off.
- That, and get the toxin back.
- Oh, the hell with the toxin.
- I just wanna rip his face off.
- No, we need the toxin.
We don't want the CIA on our backs all our lives.
- Just so I get to rip his face off.
- I promise we'll rip his face off after we get the toxin.
Hey!
Hello, honey!
Hello!
No, no, you idiot!
My shoes!
- Hey, Stan.
- What?
Looks like you're gonna be facing KGB tribunals.
Unless, of course, you'd like to make an arrangement.
Would such an arrangement include, uh, unlimited expense account?
Condo on the Potomac?
Redskins season tickets?
Huh?
Aw, nuts!
Thanks, Humphrey.
It was sweet of you.
Oh, it was my pleasure, Lauren.
Well, what should we do first?
Get a little sushi?
Take in a show?
Now, why do they do that?
Has there ever been one woman in the history of the world who actually said...
"Yes, fellas, please, take me now."
For a bed and a bath, I'd...
I'd consider it.
- Bite your tongue.
- Hey, turisto.
Welcome.
Hey, you're lookin' for a guide, right?
Native Indian to show you the hidden wonders of this great Chicatacawa nation?
Well, ladies, you have found him.
Special price, today only... $20.
I don't want to be the first to break this to you... you are not an Indian.
That's a technicality.
I've been a blood brother to the Chicatacawa since 1968.
I got a tan.
What do you want for $20?
Honey, I'm an actress.
I love to dress up and pretend.
And the hat is fabulous.
But what we need right now is to find a man.
Well, okay, but it's not gonna be that great.
- I'm a little bombed.
- What?
And it's still $20.
No.
No, no.
No, no, no.
- We're looking for a specific man...
- So we can kill him.
Oh, then you need a witness.
Hey, I'll stand up for you in court.
I saw the whole thing.
It was an accident.
The axe slipped out of your hand.
It's a wonderful scenario.
When we find the guy, we're gonna let you know.
- Thanks.
- Find him?
Find as in "locate"? "Track down"?
Hey, now we are rollin'.
We have hit the nail right on the hammer.
I'm a tracker.
That's my vocation... a tracker.
A guy who tracks down other guys.
That's my main gig!
Genuine Indian shit.
- What do you think?
- He's a bum.
But he might have good instincts.
Should we ask for references?
Hey, you wanna find this guy or not?
- Ah, ancient Indian techniques.
- Oh, those could be anybody's.
Yeah, they could...
anybody about 185 pounds... dragging his right leg a little like it's injured.
And... smoking one hand-rolled Colton's... every three minutes.
Admit it.
The man is cool.
- Yeah, come on.
- Oh, baby.
Yeah, why you do this to me, huh?
Oh, my God.
Wow!
That is some major ill repute happening there.
- Come on, let's go.
- No, no, don't try it.
You'll never get past Gert.
It's customers only.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Come on.
Hey.
- Let's go, will ya.
Come on.
- Customers?
Customers!
You get his shirt, I'll get his pants.
What?
Come on!
You had your chance at me, and you lost it.
Come on, now!
- Oh, I want the hat.
- Will you stop it!
Who do you think you're kiddin', huh?
How old are you boys?
Thirteen?
Fourteen?
Hell, you're just babies.
Why, you can't even shave yet.
- Your daddy know you're here?
- Hell, yes.
He told us where to come.
Come.
Get it?
Oh.
First time.
Oh, no way!
- It's his first time.
- What'd you tell her that fer?
- You chickenshit, huh?
- I ain't!
I done it plenty!
- You chickenshit.
You chickenshit.
- Oh, you always tell my secrets.
I'm gonna get you.
Chickenshit...
Oh, lordy, don't do that.
That ain't no way to act in a whorehouse.
Be a man.
Be a man!
This is Tina and Maria.
Have fun.
Yeah, now tell me how we're gonna get it up.
Definitely not.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
- He's there.
- "Oh, God, oh, God."
- Won't be long now.
- Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God!
Oh...
Oh, God!
- That was it.
- He'll be asleep in three seconds.
Did you ever think you'd be glad men roll over and pass out?
- Okay?
- You've gotta be...
Have a nice day.
- I've come to a definite conclusion.
- What's that?
You can have him.
Oh, God.
Was it good for you too?
H-H-Hurry!
Hey, baby!
Help me up!
You guys are the sweetest, most gorgeous creatures.
You're sweet.
Yikes!
- Hey, wait a minute.
Guys!
- Wait a minute.
We're not supposed to stop.
Why...
Why are we stopping?
Why did we stop?
- Oh.
Sorry.
- Uh, w-we have to get to a phone.
- Yeah, uh, uh, phone.
- We have to...
Oh, God.
- Phone.
Phone.
- Oh, my God.
- What are you doing here?
- Trying to get back to the reservation... before one of these guys hits on me for my phone number.
- Oh, come on, you don't look so bad.
- Except for prints don't work for him.
He should stick with solids.
- Wait a minute.
Did he say phone?
- Phone!
- Frank!
- Leave me alone!
- Frank, you have to listen!
- No, I don't!
- Yes, you do!
- Oh!
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
- Oh.
- I'm sorry, Frank, but this is really important.
- Oh, leave me alone.
- Just leave me alone!
- Look, we gotta use your phone.
Forget it!
You stiffed me for $20.
You leave me in drag.
You got some maniac with a knife chasing you.
These things do not tempt me to wanna team up with you guys.
- Ah, what's wrong with my head?
- Are you okay?
No!
I think I'm gettin' sober!
Look, listen, Frank, we're not just jerking you around.
Some guys are chasing us 'cause one of them stole a virus... that's gonna kill and destroy all the plants and all the trees for thousands of miles all the way around.
We stole it back, so now they're trying to kill us.
You get it?
Jesus, the '60s were good to you, weren't they?
Frank, that's right.
Think back to the '60s.
- People did things for each other.
- They were wasted.
Listen, Frankie, get us to a telephone, all right?
I swear to you, you're gonna be showered with money.
Showered with money.
Okay, ladies, this is it.
This is it, Frank?
It's not exactly the hub of the reservation, is it?
- Hey, it's off season.
What do you want?
- We wanna use the phone, Frank.
Hey, five minutes.
That's it.
If you guys stay more than five minutes, you'll bring down a goddam tornado.
We have no intention of hanging around.
- Fine.
- I just wanna make this call...
I must have that blouse!
- That shirt has my name on it.
- Oh!
Oh, I love this.
- I wore one of these when I did Oklahoma.
- Oh, that'll be cute on you.
- You think?
Not too short-waisted?
- No!
You get a little snakeskin belt, give it a little texture.
- Oh, that's a good idea.
I like this too.
- Hey!
Will ya?
Come on, now.
Just take the blouse.
Keep 'em.
They're on the house.
- Now, you gotta make this phone call.
- Oh, thanks, Frank.
- Get on the phone, and let's get going here.
Right.
Right, right, right.
Okay, who are we gonna call?
The New York Times.
Huh?
- No.
We'll call the president.
- Oh, yeah!
That's really a call he's gonna take.
"Hi, we're two struggling actresses.
We're saving the world." Get real.
He was an actor.
Okay, the FBI.
We're gonna call the FBI, we're gonna turn this in, we're gonna save our country.
Uh-huh.
Do you have a changing room?
This doesn't work.
They must have cut me off.
- I owe 'em a little money.
- Don't you know how to deal with those dorks?
- You don't have to pay them anything.
- You don't?
- No, all you have to do...
- No!
- What?
No, not that again.
Frank, how do we get to a phone that works?
Frank, how do we get to a phone that works?
Okay, ladies, this here's Frodo.
He'll take real good care of ya.
Now, you're gonna ride across those hills till you come to the edge of a cliff.
Don't go off there.
That's a 700-foot drop.
Now, if you do get down, you're gonna come to the rattlesnake area.
Be real careful goin' through there.
Now, take a left at the rattlesnakes and you'll come around to a dirt road.
Take you right into the taco stand.
They got a phone in there.
Huh?
It couldn't be just a block and a half to the corner store, Frank?
Not around here.
- Hey, Frank, thanks.
- Oh, okay, all right.
- Now, come on, we gotta...
- We won't forget you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- We're gonna see you get something out of this, Frank.
- Oh, yeah, sure.
I'll be showered with money.
I can hardly wait.
Come on, let's get outta here.
- Come on.
- Wait, wait, wait.
I don't have the toxin.
- Wait a minute.
- Oh, hold on a second there.
Give me the vial.
Slowly.
- Let go of me!
- Go!
Whoa!
Asshole!
Come on!
Well, of course.
Russell!
Boyd!
- Where's the other one?
- She got away.
- Now you're gonna make yourself useful.
- I don't know how to drive a stick shift.
- Get in the back.
- Oh.
Let's turn around, okay?
Let's just go this way.
Holy shit.
Go away!
- Frank?
- Go away!
- What happened?
Where's Lauren?
- They took her.
- We gotta go find her.
- Oh, no!
Frank, I can't track her without you.
Now, please, come on!
- You go!
I'm busy bleeding!
- Frank!
You don't give up, do ya?
You think I'm gonna go chasing a pack of psychos for some dumb blonde?
She's not dumb, and she's not a blonde.
- Well, good luck, lady.
- Frank!
Frank!
Okay, okay, the truth.
Lauren and I pulled a bank job.
Those guys were feds, and Lauren buried the money...
- Spare me, will ya?
- Well, what about revenge?
I mean, these guys trashed your house.
Don't you want to get even?
I'm insured.
No deductible.
Save your breath.
I'm running out of bullshit, Frank.
They're gonna kill her.
I know it's not your problem... but this person and I, we've been through a lot of disgusting things together.
This person and I are...
This person's a friend... and I don't have that many friends.
I do.
I do.
Hello, Michael.
This is Atkins.
Hello, Joe.
Do you have the money?
Yep, it's here.
Fine.
Here it is.
You'll get into the chopper and fly to Mesa Azul Cliffs at the Four Fingers.
Don't even think about ground support because I've got lookouts.
Now, if I see a plane, a tank, a chopper other than your chopper...
I'll get very nervous and I'm gonna dump this stuff in the first stiff wind blowing east.
You got it?
You will not land the chopper.
You'll come level with the mesa and you'll lower the money down to me... at 5.:00 p.m. Exactly.
And now you're gonna make the exchange.
I knew you wouldn't keep your end of the bargain.
This is your big moment.
Don't you wanna do it yourself?
Atkins is a crack shot.
Like I said, I'm doing the exchange.
- I see somebody.
It's Lauren.
- Now you wanna tell me how much you believe them?
No, don't shoot.
Sir, she's being coerced.
- Will you land this damn thing!
- He's trying!
Throw down the bag.
- Throw it down.
- You'll shoot me.
I'm really sorry about this.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
- Aren't you dead yet?
- Not till I play Hamlet.
- Boy!
- Oh, you came back.
- Sure!
- I can't believe it.
- And look at you.
You made off with the works.
- Yes.
- I got the toxin and $20 million.
- Wow!
This time I...
l-I think I'll hold the money.
- You don't mind.
- Oh, look, there's Weldon.
Maybe we can hitch a ride with those guys.
Hey, handsome!
- Go!
Go!
- Go where?
I will never... date a man again.
- Sandy.
- Getting laid just isn't worth it.
Oh, Sandy!
Get it!
Get it!
Pull!
Pull!
Oh!
There is no God.
- Hey, look!
- Hey, look!
Yes.
Let's go.
- Let's go.
- Oh, fuck.
You son of a bitch!
En garde!
- Yes!
- Go!
- Where is it?
Shit.
- I don't have it!
I have it.
Let her go.
No!
You...
Shit.
Ah, nuts.
Oh, shit!
Nine years of ballet, asshole!
You did it!
You did it!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
That is the best Hamlet ever.
Except for mine.
Wow!
Yeah!
Oh, this is the happiest moment of my life.
- They bought that shit.
- Sh... "Shit"?
You're calling my Hamlet shit?
He's a wimp.
I mean, look at him.
He can't make up his mind about anything.
He stands around all night and says, "What'll I do?
What'll I do?
What'll I do?"
Give me Romeo or Henry the Fifth.
Now, there's a guy I could boff.
Boff?
Oh, we're back to boffing, are we?
- I see.
That's...
That's the criteria for your great...
- Absolutely!
Right, whether you would boff the hero.
Well, who will you go to
When there's no one to betray
And I said
Who will you go to
When your best friend turns away
Hey, hey
Last time you're gonna let me down
Last time you're gonna fool around with me
It's the last time
Last time you're gonna let me down
Last time you're gonna fool around with me
It's the last time, baby
Last time you're gonna let me down
Last time you're gonna fool around with me
It's the last time
Last time you're gonna let me down
Last time you're gonna fool around with me
It's the last time, baby
There's a garden full of roses
There's a necklace full of pearls
You have come to take the roses
To give to other girls
Well, I'm just a pretty thing
You wanted for a day
There is nothing left between us
There is nothing left to say
Hey, hey
Last time you're gonna let me down
Last time you're gonna fool around with me
Last time you're gonna let me down
Last time you're gonna fool around with me
It's the last time
[Chuckling] Come on, man.
Get some bones in your wrist.
[Chuckling]
All right.
All right.
There you go.
Jim McMahon ain't got nothin'on you.
That's right.
[Continues Chuckling]
Man, where are these dudes?
[Continues, Indistinct]
Ah, man. 5:15 in the a.m.
This is damn indecent.
[Groans]
Hey, no lie, man.
Camille and I... were about this far away from the promised land.
[Grunts]
[Sighs] My beeper went off.
[Chuckles]
If you're having trouble covering the territory, buddy, I know a good plastic surgeon.
So where are these guys?
[Grunts] Right in front of the defenders.
Am I a star, or am I a star?
Oh, man, give me a break.
Rico, Sonny— Glad y'all could get here.
We don't usually get up this early, boys, to come to the circus.
Oh.
[Tubbs] So these are the guys that won "officer of the month"?
Twice this year.
[Speaking Spanish]
Rico, do you remember when the guys that won "cop of the month"... didn't look like extras from jane Fonda's Workout?
Ah.
Oh, that's amazing... that guys your age can remember back that far.
[Crockett Laughing]
Come on, man.
Give us a break.
We've got a little emergency practice after the T.C.B. Here.
[Tubbs] Yeah, speaking of taking care of business, where's your search warrant?
You see, gentlemen, when you serve a warrant on our turf, it is customary, standard operating procedure... for you to get local accompaniment.
That's right.
With your rep you're gonna tell us about standard operating procedure.
That's right, buddy.
We got the gold badges.
You don't.
Okay.
I can dig that.
Come the end of next month, we'll both be wearing gold.
We're taking the sergeants exam on the 25th.
You're kidding.
That's pretty quick.
Can't get any quicker.
Nine days, 36 months out of the old academia.
[Crockett] Well, I gotta tell ya, they must be changing the standards for gold shields around here.
They're givin' 'em to guys that bust guys for stealin' ghetto blasters.
Ghetto blasters?
Yeah.
Items described... as three portable stereos, commonly known as ghetto blasters, valued at 600 bucks.
Gentlemen, this is embarrassing.
[Laughing]
Yeah.
Well, this may look like a nickel-and-dime bust on paper, but our street sources say that the parole-slippin' sucker in that apartment... witnessed the DeLaCruz shooting.
We think he can pin some heavy characters.
No kiddin'.
Let's stop shootin' the breeze and go on up there and get him.
Take Rico with you.
Hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let me see that.
[Sighs]
"Premises in the corner apartment facing west on the third floor."
Come on, buddy.
You know my knee's been givin' me a little problem lately.
What do you say, huh?
Heads.
[Chuckling]
You know, they say a good, brisk walk is very healthy for you.
Yeah.
Do it for Camille.
Go get 'em.
[Laughing] Workin' overtime.
?
[Man Singing Pop]
?
[Continues]
?
[Continues]
?
[Continues]
At least they got taste, huh?
South Dade Vice.
Open up.
This one's on me, partner.
?
[Continues]
Eddie?
Go get help.
[Shouts] Eddie!
Go get help!
I got him.
Hang on, Eddie.
Damn it.
Damn it.
I'm okay, Bobby.
Okay.
Okay.
Damn it.
[Sighs]
?
[Ends] Damn it.
Damn it!
[Chattering]
[Crockett] What we had was, uh— [Siren Wails]
I was stationed down here.
I positioned myself out here.
My partner, Trumbull and Diaz were upstairs.
I heard an explosion.
I went up the stairs.
Trumbull was down.
[Chattering]
[Crockett] That's when they called everybody in.
There were no suspects in the house.
Vic Varnell, Special Investigations.
How's Trumbull look?
I don't think he's gonna make it.
Where are we?
Third floor.
You're gonna need some stitches.
It ain't right, man.
What happened ain't right.
These the two who saw it?
He wants to make a statement.
He's got a real bad cut.
He's a little shaky.
Well, take him to the hospital.
I'll talk to him later.
Come on, man.
[Groans]
[Castillo] Keep the press away from him.
Detective Varnell, Detective Tubbs.
[Varnell] You all right to talk?
Talk.
Can't you see?
It's all in the floor, man, just like that Broward cop that walked into a room full of ether 10 days ago.
Okay.
Come on, pal.
Take it easy.
Easy?
Just like that Broward cop?
How about that cop in Hialeah?
Or the cops in Coconut Grove that ended up serving search warrants on empty warehouses?
Let's talk about what happened here.
Because officially they are still listed as three separate incidents on three unrelated occasions.
Yeah, different cases, different suspects, with the same result.
They all knew that the cops were comin'.
And that's one of the possibilities that I'm here to investigate.
Let me lay a flash on you.
Somebody is leaking information on our search warrants!
Let's take this someplace else.
Come on.
[Chattering]
[Diaz] Eddie's gonna be okay?
Don't worry about him.
Let's get you out of here.
Any leads on the bombing?
We hear your partner's in critical condition.
Do you feel lucky?
Back off!
Lucky?
I'll tell you who's lucky— whoever set my partner up.
He's lucky I haven't started looking for him yet.
Did you get that?
[Switek] Okay.
Glenn Mclntyre, S.I.D. Hey, thanks for your help.
There's another one of your guys upstairs.
All right.
[Siren Wails, Fades]
All warrants except the sealed warrants that come out of the grand jury... are processed through the computer.
So anyone who has access to a Justice Department terminal, from a janitor to a judge, can access that information.
Well, then you better get to work, man.
1,200 people work in theJustice Building!
Why don't we just call the bad guys and tell them to take a couple of months off... so we can close down the force and conduct interviews?
Now, can we talk about what happened here today?
Yeah, well, what happened here today... means that you gotta be crazy to work as a cop!
And I am not crazy!
I was, uh, on my way to my witness... just for the, uh— [Tubbs] We're overworked, underbudgeted, understaffed, and now we got to wear targets on our chest!
For all we know, the damn winos know who the hell we arel
Rico.
Ease up, man.
Tell me you don't understand what I'm talkin' about.
I hear you.
I hear you.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, Jack.
They'd have jumped on this like white on rice in New York.
They'd have never let this leak get this far.
Never.
S.I.D.'s handling the leak, Rico.
End of discussion.
Well, until S.I.D. Finishes their investigation, I'm not workin'.
'Cause nobody's gonna scrape this body off this pavement or off of some dealer's doorstep!
Nobody!
[Castillo] Go home, Rico.
Get cleaned up.
File a report.
Be back in my office by 4:00 p.m. Pick up your new assignment.
- Or what?
- Or take a suspension.
Well, I'll do you one better.
I'd rather be playing the lottery in New York City... than Russian roulette in Miami.
I quit.
[Badge Clatters]
Eddie Trumbull— he didn't make it out of surgery.
[Sighs]
Look.
Just subtract the loan from the balance and give me what's left.
For the third time, people with outstanding loans... must see loan officers.
That's standard procedure, which I wouldn't have to grow old telling you if you'd read the forms posted in the display case.
Dig.
I am leaving this job, I am leaving this town, and I don't have time for "standard procedure".
[Scoffs] And I don't have time for your life story.
Read the procedure.
Next.
So this is your display case?
I want my damn money!
And I want it now!
Sure.
Uh— Uh— l-I'll call bookkeeping my-myself.
Uh, get security right away.
[Diaz] If Eddie knew what was behind that door this morning... and one of us still had to go through it,
Eddie would've made sure it was him.
It's just the kind of guy he was, you know?
He didn't deserve to die sold-out.
No one does.
Lieutenant, I just got a strange phone call from downtown.
They say they're holding one of your detectives on assault— a Ricardo Tubbs.
Get in touch with my office.
Contact a Detective Crockett.
Get him down there as soon as possible.
Thank you.
And we were gonna be sergeants together.
We were gonna go for the gold.
You made reputations to be proud of.
The best you can do for him is to maintain yours.
I gotta find who did this to him.
Let us take care of that.
[Phone Rings]
Judge Robb's office.
[Man] Is Martha out to lunch yet?
Soon.
How are things?
Everything went fine.
I'm counting the money right now.
Listen, I want you to pull the file on a Vice cop, okay?
It's Ricardo Tubbs.
T-U-B-B-S.
The one they busted?
What are you talking about?
It's all over the department.
He freaked out in the credit union.
Took three guys to bring him downtown.
- When?
- Hold on.
You're gonna make me look bad, working through lunch.
Who's working?
I just wanna use the WATS line.
[Chuckles] Bye.
- Okay.
What's happening?
- Uh, never mind.
Listen.
Just pull his file and give me all the case numbers of any mug shots or records he might've requested lately.
Okay, you got that?
I got it.
What's happening?
I'll tell you later.
Listen, this one is too good to be true.
[Chuckling] I'll talk to you.
[Typing]
I just wanted my money.
[Crockett] I'll lend you the money.
I don't want you to lend me the money.
I want exactly what the department owes me.
To do what?
To go back to New York.
[Scoffs] What are you gonna do in New York, man?
Work.
Yeah.
I'll work, man.
I'll work as a P.I., join a security agency... and maybe play the numbers.
What the hell difference does it make what I do?
Makes a lot of difference to me.
You're my partner.
I don't have any partner anymore.
I'm out.
O-U-T, out!
And until this damn department gets its act together, you should be out too!
Rico, why don't you just take a week off?
Come on.
I don't need a week.
Don't patronize me, Sonny.
Listen, buddy.
There ain't nobody patronizing you.
You can't even see what you're doing.
It's simple.
I've had it.
I want my money... and my book.
If the department doesn't give me what they owe me—
If they don't cough it up, I'll get it off the street.
Let me tell you something, pal.
You start dealing with loan sharks, and Castillo will do more than suspend you.
Who's Castillo?
Are you gonna bust me?
Huh?
You gonna bust me?
Well, bust me now or else I'm out of here.
[Sighs]
Three years.
That guy's been my partner for three years.
When a guy goes over the edge, sometimes trying to help just, uh, pushes him further.
I think this guy's gotta come back on his own, if he goes back at all.
?
[Whistling]
What are you doing?
[Chuckles] You're a trained observer, right?
What's that supposed to mean?
Why don't you just take care of the six inches in front of your own nose?
Yeah, well, uh, Tubbs, that's not the way it works.
Don't you think I wanted to roll over when Larry got whacked?
Hell, I wanted to get out of this pit more than anybody.
But I'm still here.
I just thought if you needed somebody to lean on—
Fine.
Just consider yourself leaned on.
Hey, Rico.
Rico.
[Sighs]
?
[Man Singing Pop] [Chattering]
Rico, everybody's gonna think you're trying to set 'em up.
Kevin, that's why I need your help.
[Sighs]
Hey, you can just— just put the word out.
[Scoffs]
Then I'll have a better chance.
Tell them—Tell them that I'll give 'em back double their juice.
They can have it at the end of the month.
[Inhales Sharply]
[Sighs] "Hello.
I got an ex-cop who wants to borrow.
No, I'm not on medication." Geez.
Rough morning, huh?
?
[Continues]
I was there.
Glenn Mclntyre.
You work Special Investigations?
Yeah.
What are you drinking?
Look, man, if you're here to check on why I'm moving—
No, man.
Not me.
No.
I mean, uh, that's someone else's assignment.
Look, if it means anything, I understand how you feel.
I do.
I mean, that could've been you going through that door this morning.
Then you turn around and you ask the department to back you up— what do they do?
What do they always do, huh?
They hide behind bureaucracy.
They cover their butts in red tape.
That ain't right.
See, for all the risks you guys take, there ought to be a little more reward, right?
Why are you laying this rap on me, man?
?
[Continues]
I hear you want out.
Now, if that's true, there's a way to do it.
You better take your S.I.D. Game somewhere else.
This ain't no game.
Line was busy.
I'll check back with you later.
You better stay out of my face!
?
[Continues]
Later.
?
[Continues]
?
[Ends]
[Shouts, Indistinct] Don't play with me, sucker!
Hey— Hey— Come on.
Easy.
I'm on the edge.
Easy, okay?
Nobody's playing.
Nobody's playing.
What were you talkin' about in there?
[Shouts] What were you talkin' about?
I was talkin' about retiring in four months with six figures in the bank, okay?
Hmm?
Are you wired?
I'm not wired.
Look, if you're not interested, fine.
Okay?
I'll leave right now.
You'll never see me again.
How do I know I can trust you?
How can I trust you, huh?
Huh?
You give the information to me, you get the money from me.
It's real simple.
It's real businesslike.
Vice info, you get a premium.
There's even room for your partner.
Forget about him.
He'd never do it.
That's fine.
There's more for you and me then.
So when do we start?
When you're ready.
I'm ready.
I've been ready.
[Chuckling] You and me are gonna be great together, you know that?
Let's go.
Needless to say, until Detective Varnell completes his investigation, you're prohibited to speak to the press.
[Switek] I realize it's supposed to be business as usual, but are there any special precautions being taken... so the county doesn't run out of body bags?
Both the bomb squad and the lab have set a second shift on 24-hour call.
Don't hesitate to use them.
D.E.A. Agent Ayres will be temporarily assigned... to fill the gap here at O.C.B.
He'll be identified through Tubbs's badge.
What's Tubbs's official status?
Suspended pending dismissal.
That'll be all.
[Scoffs] That's nice, huh?
The bomb squad gets a little O.T., and we're walking into booby traps every other warrant.
[Castillo] Detective, do you have a comment?
No, sir.
My office, gentlemen.
[Sighs]
Sit.
So, I've heard some good things about you from my people.
Yeah?
Well,
I got something for you that's even better than I got them— a Vice cop.
I'm not just talkin' about warrants.
I'm talkin' about all the paper in your file.
Every piece of the puzzle.
Don't sell me, show me.
Should be no problem.
Good.
Do it.
And if he comes through, I'll meet him.
Meet him?
What for?
I can bring you the information.
I'm a businessman, Mclntyre.
I've got questions to ask him that you don't need to hear.
Mr. Avilla, all due respect, he may not want to meet you.
Show me he is what you say he is, then bring him to me, and you can both name your price.
All right.
I'll work on it.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Man, I can get this kind of garbage myself.
Wait a minute.
You asked for information on search warrants, and that's it.
No, no, no.
This ain't gonna make it.
Look, I just made a deal with someone... who can give us the kind of cash we were talking about...
and more.
In one shot.
But I need something very special from you.
Who's the contact?
Onofrio Avilla.
[Both Chuckle]
Wow.
I need all the paper Vice has on him.
That's a lot of paper, man.
Can't handle it?
Oh, I can handle it...
if it's worth it.
Hey, come on.
I brought you in on this.
Now I'm telling you, it's worth it.
Just make sure that the money's green.
[Chuckling]
[Woman] Glenn, I don't like it.
[Mclntyre] Everything is under control.
That's not what I'm talking about.
The cop they killed yesterday— [Sighs] Vicky—
I thought the one in Broward was a mistake, but I don't think so anymore.
I have no control over these people, the way they do things.
I'm not blaming you— They're not Boy Scouts.
They're very serious people, Vick.
But I can't go on like this forever.
How would you rather go on living?
Would you rather me go out there for some 400 bucks a week, getting pension in 20 years for some sorry 60%?
Or maybe you'd rather see me get buried with a flag on my chest.
Is that what you want?
I thought you wanted to make it.
I do.
But there's gotta be another way.
Then you give it to me.
Tell me what to do.
'Cause waiting 25 years for a gold watch is not gonna make it.
If you want somethin' in this life, you gotta take it.
Nobody gives you nothin'.
Nothing's for free.
Besides, who knows how many times that Tubbs guy could have bought it workin' undercover?
Then he asks for help, and what do they do?
They suspend him.
That's not right.
Glenn, I just don't think I can do this forever.
Come here.
You're not gonna have to.
I just lined up a piece of business with a major dealer.
He can give us the kind of cash we were talkin' about.
[Sighs]
We will be set.
And you can be there if you want to be.
[Giggling] You know I want it.
You do?
Then relax.
Everything's gonna be fine.
We're this close.
This close.
Hey, Rico.
Hey, Bobby.
What are you doing here?
[Sighs] Couldn't sleep.
I, uh, decided to do my supplemental on yesterday morning.
Yeah.
How're you handling that?
I don't know.
I guess it's put me through some changes.
Yeah, that's understandable.
I hear you're goin' through some changes too.
Well, nothing I can't handle.
You're really gonna bag it?
Yeah, not a day too soon.
What you got there?
It's a case file.
Something I gotta sign off.
Well, look.
Before you sign off for good, man, I gotta tell you something.
Backin' out is a weak play.
I think you're doing the wrong thing.
Yeah?
Well, who are you to judge me?
Teenybopper... tryin' to cowboy your way up to the top of the ladder.
Man, I was working the New York streets when you were buying corsages for the prom.
Maybe so.
But I been around long enough to scope someone sneaking out the back door!
Call it anything you like.
I've been shot.
And I been let down one too many times.
The last thing I need is some punk cop in my face!
Yeah, punk.
You're the punk!
Eddie died a better cop than you ever could've been!
[Grunts]
The entire file as promised.
Just give me my money, man.
We'll make the exchange of the goods tomorrow morning, Tubbs.
In that case, you might want to know about a particular warehouse that Avilla owns... on Canal Street.
- What about it?
- Vice is gonna hit it tomorrow morning.
Good.
That's a nice piece of icing.
- That icing's not free.
- You'll get paid, Tubbs.
Don't get pushy.
Hey, look.
Don't tell me how to play the game, Mclntyre.
I need the cash, man.
[Line Clicks, Dial Tone]
[Handset Settles In Cradle] [Engine Starts]
[Whispering] There he is.
[Vehicle Approaching]
Relax.
Hold.
Let's do it.
Here we go.
[Creaking]
[Gunshot]
Go!
Go!
Go!
Your boss and I are about to do some serious business.
[Engine Starts]
Get an ambulance.
Move!
This is the third in a series of police ambushes in the past two weeks, which Channel 9 sources suggest ties to high-level corruption in the police department itself.
Get those cameras out of here.
[Man] Okay, folks.
It's all over.
[Chattering]
[Man] Come on.
Come on.
Sir?
[Gina] Are you all right?
[Groans] I'll be fine, which is more than I can say for whoever measured the powder in those blanks.
Quit your complaining.
Rico didn't give Mclntyre the file until 1:00 a.m.
And then the bomb squad waited all night for Avilla's men to finish... before they could get in and rerig the gun.
[Groans] As long as it gets us the wiretaps.
The prosecutor's trying to get us the okay from the grand jury as we speak.
What about the warrant Tubbs signed on Mclntyre?
Should be in the central computer for his source to pick up on it by this evening.
We're just waiting for Rico to tell us where Mclntyre wants him to meet tonight.
So, what do you do for an encore?
I sit on Mclntyre and hope he doesn't burn our surveillance... before his source tips him about Tubbs's warrant.
Just lie down.
You're supposed to be wounded.
Oh, yeah.
Say, you wouldn't want to grant a dying man's last request?
[Sighs]
[Woman] Stay tuned to WRQE for further updates on the shotgun slaying... of a policeman on 28th Street in South Miami.
And now back to more hits.
[Ringing]
Yeah.
[Mclntyre] We got to talk now.
Our deal was for tonight.
You bring my money.
I know what our deal was.
Everything's changed.
Nothing's changed, Mclntyre.
You listen to me.
This whole thing is coming together right now.
It's on their terms.
You understand?
We only got one shot at this.
Play ball with me, and you're gonna be out of here with everything you need by this evening, all right?
You gotta give me more time.
I got some other things I gotta do.
Cancel them.
I'm on my way.
?
[Rock On Stereo]
[Engine Starts]
Assistant State Attorney Kaplan's here.
Grand jury authorized the taps on Mclntyre's apartment and his car phone.
- Who knows?
- Grand jury, me, your investigative team.
- I'm on my way to the phone company now.
- What about Ayres?
Oh, he's fine.
He said he's got plenty of time to get his squad together... to back up tonight's meet with Mclntyre and Tubbs.
Just make sure nobody moves until they're positive that they have Mclntyre's source.
That means they have something specific on taps... or that they actually witness an exchange of information.
Oh, I made it very clear.
If we have to grab Mclntyre before we know who's leaking his information, we're gonna have to let him cop a plea and give up his source, and nobody wants to do that.
Lieutenant, our only problem is that Mclntyre's arrest warrant— [Phone Rings]
Is already in the computer system.
Which means if Mclntyre's already heard from his source,
Tubbs's cover is blown.
Tubbs knew the plan from the start.
It's the only piece of information we knew.
It might draw the attention of the leak.
[Handset Settles In Cradle]
Tubbs is on line two.
You're on the speakerphone.
In the room with me is Assistant State Attorney Kaplan.
He brought some information.
[Tubbs] Mclntyre moved the meet up.
He's on his way here right now.
Listen.
They had to release the warrant last night.
There might be a possibility that he knows.
Do you think you've been made?
I don't think so.
Seems like he wanted to talk more business.
I tried to put him off, but I thought he might get suspicious.
Let Tubbs pop Mclntyre, hold him until the backup gets there.
Look, if I pop him, his leak is gonna dive so deep that we'll never find him.
So we'll let Mclntyre make a deal.
It's the best we got.
Forget it.
What kind of deal did those dead cops get?
No deals.
That's what this thing is all about.
Lieutenant, even if Mclntyre hasn't heard from his source yet... and Tubbs is with him when he finds out, Tubbs is gone, Lieutenant.
Gone!
He's here, Lieutenant.
You're there.
It's your call.
Just find that leak.
See if Crockett can get to Tubbs on time.
Put on a loose tail.
Let me know the moment your taps are on.
Let's go.
What?
[Tapping Keys]
Damn it!
- You've been made, sport.
- [Hammer Cocks]
Oy, man.
Kill him.
I'm a suspect, you jerk!
I'm the first one they're gonna pin it on.
Avilla's gotta handle this.
You're going down, Mclntyre.
No matter what you do, you're going down.
Shut up!
- Anything yet?
- No.
They're still trying to run down Mclntyre's car.
Castillo's on the horn with Switek now.
Can you reach Mclntyre's car phone?
[Switek] It went out of range right after I heard him get the call from his girl.
- [Castillo] How long?
- [Switek] Well, I'm working on a booster transmitter now.
But even if I get through to him, it's gonna take me a couple of hours to triangulate his location.
- Keep me posted.
- Right.
Can I speak to you outside?
I know my lieutenant's not gonna give you a deal up front, but I know if you do anything that can be helpful— I just want my lawyer.
She just wants her lawyer.
Great.
?
[Man Singing Soft Rock]
Stay with him.
?
[Continues]
[No Audible Dialogue]
?
[Continues]
[No Audible Dialogue]
[No Audible Dialogue]
Yeah.
Patch me into Vice— Detective Crockett.
It's an emergency.
[Phone Rings]
Crockett.
This is Diaz.
- I found the leak.
- Where are you?
About a mile past Kendall on the Intercoastal.
It's Tubbs and Mclntyre, man.
Come and get the bodies.
Diaz, w—
[Engine Revs, Tires Screech]
?
[Continues]
Yeah.
I need every piece of backup you can get.
Out.
Tubbs, you pig!
[Gunshots Continue]
Freeze!
[Grunts]
[Siren Wailing]
?
[Continues]
[Sirens Wailing]
?
[Continues]
Bobby, man.
Look, I didn't go over.
[Straining] Get your— Get your dirty hands off me.
Bobby.
Freeze.
Put it down, Mac.
[Chuckling] Who you kidding?
- [Shouts] - [Gunshot]
?
[Continues]
?
[Ends] [Helicopter Approaching]
[Police Radio, Indistinct]
Take as much time off as necessary.
Well, man, I just can't get used to it.
Cops selling each other out.
[Sighs] You gotta try and think of it as just another assignment.
'Cause in the end, that's all it is.
The world keeps turning.
Yeah, maybe.
Sometimes I don't know what kind of world I'm protecting anymore.
Try and remember.
We won this round.
Perhaps.
You know the worst part of it?
Bobby died thinkin' I sold him and Eddie out.
[Sighs] You have to believe he heard you, man.
Excuse me.
For you and Eddie.
Er, let's start, shall we?
I'll serve.
(Man) Balls, judge.
Bad luck, Judge.
What rotten luck!
Really, Guthrie.
Nice one, Judge!
- Mine, Marigold!
- Mine!
- Oh!
- Guthrie!
Are you all right?
- Nothing broken, I hope?
- It's my elbow.
Twiddle your fingers.
There you are.
Nothing broken.
Ooh!
Ooh.
Oh, the most extraordinary shooting pain!
Oh, you poor man!
You are in the wars, aren't you?
Rotten luck.
Such a super shot!
- It'll wear off.
- Absolutely no signs of wearing off.
Rub it.
For heaven's sake, Guthrie!
Don't be such a baby.
Ooh!
Ah!
Ooh.
Muscular, is it, Your Lordship's affliction?
Muscular, Norman.
One tries not to complain.
Only one thing for a muscular pain.
- Aspirins?
- No, no, throw away the aspirins.
No, no, it's a deep massage.
- That's what Your Lordship needs.
- Oh.
- Here, let me slip this off for you.
Oh.
Your Lordship would need a masseuse with strong fingers, to manipulate the fibres in depth.
- Ooh!
- Yes, I can feel.
- They're in need of deep manipulation.
- Really?
I know the masseuse who'd get down to those fibres and release the tension.
- You do?
- The wife's sister's daughter, Elsie.
Thoroughly respectable, fingers like the grab of a crane.
- Talented girl.
- Just what the doctor ordered.
Our little Elsie's brought relief to thousands of sufferers.
Where does she carry out her practice?
In a hygienically run health centre, My Lord, a stone's throw off the Tottenham Court Road.
The Tottenham Court Road?
- It's not oriental in any way, is it?
- Bless you, no, My Lord.
No, they're all respectable girls, mostly drawn from the Croydon area.
All medically trained.
Medically trained?
Well, that's reassuring.
Yes, they've made a thorough study of the human anatomy.
As you've received no relief through the usual channels...
My doctor's absolutely useless.
Well, then, there you are, My Lord.
You're quite right, Norman.
Why not try a little alternative medicine?
- Good for you.
- Oh!
(Henry) We'll book that for 4.30...
- Ha-ha-ha!
- (Henry) Very good, sir.
"Through the Jungle very softly flits a shadow and a sigh..."
Is this our old clerk's room or the tropical house at Kew Gardens?
It's Mr Hearthstoke.
Hearthstoke!
Some old gardener, no doubt?
No, Mr Hearthstoke's the new young man in chambers.
He reckons our office needs a more contemporary look.
I was ticked off for golfing.
- Uncle Tom's been ticked off.
- Asked to do it upstairs.
But down here you see the world passing by.
You carry on putting.
Imagine you're on the fourth green at Kuala Lumpur.
I don't know that one.
Could I have a word?
In confidence?
In the passage?
It's not only my clerk's room that should have a more contemporary look, he says we could do with a more up-market typist.
Dianne has always been extremely popular with the legal executives.
She's a very fine-Iooking girl, Dianne.
A very fine... sturdy-Iooking girl.
Worse than that, he wants to privatise the clerking.
He what?
Mr Hearthstoke's not over-enamoured of my ten percent.
Good God!
If barristers' clerks didn't get their ten percent we'd have no one left to envy.
He's got his criticisms of you too, Mr Rumpole.
That's why I thought we might be in the same boat.
- Of me?
- We've had our differences in the past...
What has he got to criticise about me, pray?
He's not over-enamoured of your old Burberry.
Oh, come on, Henry.
Why this hangdog look?
What on earth's the need for this stricken whisper?
If he's only been here a few weeks...
He was voted in when you were in Cardiff.
Why does our head of chambers pay any attention to this Mr Hearthrug?
Quite frankly, it seems to Dianne and me he thinks the sun shines out of Mr Hearthstoke's...
Aren't you coming to chambers meeting, Rumpole?
(Indistinct chatter)
I've asked Hearthstoke to carry out an efficiency study into Number Three Equity Court, and I must say he's done a superb job, quite superb.
- Would you speak to this paper?
- Will it answer back?
- What's that, Rumpole?
- Nothing, nothing at all.
That's a good one!
Would it answer back!
Shh!
Tut-tut-tut!
I am doing a feasibility study in putting our clerking out to private tender.
A young upthrusting group of chartered accountants could do the job at considerably less than Henry's ten percent.
As a matter of fact, I'm entirely in favour of the privatisation of Henry.
Speaking as a chap with daughters, I can ill afford ten percent.
Those of us with a bit of practice at the bar, those of us who can't spend our days doing feasibility studies on the price of paper-clips, try to keep our clerk's room happy.
I don't want to find it full of upthrusting young chartered accountants.
- It'd bring up my breakfast.
- Is that all?
Absolutely.
I'm going to work.
There's a dingy-Iooking character in a dirty mac in the waiting room for you.
Thank you.
Yes, I was going to raise the general standard of appearance.
Raise it on your own, Hearthrug.
I'm busy.
Dr Maurice Horridge.
Where does the "Doctor" come from, by the way?
New Bognor, a small seat of learning in the shadow of the Canadian Rockies.
- You know Canada well, do you?
- I was never out of England.
Alas.
So, your degree, you wrote up for it?
A diploma by correspondence, nonetheless valuable for that.
- (Rumpole) A doctorate in...
- Theology, Mr Rumpole.
I trust you find that helpful?
Oh, yes, very helpful indeed, if you want to be well up on the Book of Job.
Or carry on an intelligent chat on the subject of Ezekiel.
I just don't see how it helps in the massage business.
The line of the body is the line of God.
We are all created in His image.
Yes, he must be a rather strange-Iooking fellow.
The girls you use in these massage parlours of yours...
- All fully trained, Mr Rumpole.
- Oh?
Medically?
In my principles, the principles of the spiritual alignment of the bones.
It's alleged, they so far forgot their spiritual mission as to indulge in hanky-panky with your customers.
I cannot believe it, Mr Rumpole.
I simply cannot believe it of my girls.
So, the defence against this charge of living on immoral earnings...
Immoral earnings?
(Chuckles) Me, who has majored in theology?
...is that, without your knowledge, your girls turned from sacred to profane massage?
(Car motor whirs)
Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Um... having a spot of bother with the elbow.
Oh, I see.
Just a fiver.
Well, keep the change.
Thank you.
- Hello!
- Oh, hello.
I telephoned.
The name's Featherstone.
Right you are, dear.
Elsie!
You can take your things off through there.
My things... off?
Elsie!
Your gentleman's here.
Oh, yes.
Thank you.
(Soothing music plays)
- Going anywhere nice for your holiday?
- Oh, I hope so.
I'm tired out with sitting.
- Are you really?
- Mm.
I've been sitting almost continuously this year.
- Fancy!
- (Sighs) It gets tiring.
I'm sure it does.
(He gasps)
(Chuckles)
Not how I did the elbow in, though.
No.
Tennis.
When I'm not sitting, my wife and I like to play a bit of tennis.
Makes a change, dear, doesn't it?
Mm.
Oh.
- It really is very much better.
- Oh, good.
I'm enormously grateful.
- There we are, then.
- Right.
Goodbye.
Mind how you go.
Bye-bye.
He says he's tired out.
Done a lot of sitting.
Oh, poor bloke.
Look, Marigold.
See what I can do.
Brilliant, Guthrie.
Do try not to dislocate anything else.
Massage parlours!
Oh, well, yes, as a matter of fact.
Doctor of theology charged with running massage parlours as disorderly houses.
How revolting.
What was it you wanted to tell me, Guthrie?
Nothing.
I'm just saying my elbow seems a lot better.
35 massage parlours in the Greater London area.
How pathetic.
Grown men having to go to places like that.
Well, I'm quite sure that some of them just needed a massage.
If you believe that, you'll believe anything.
Arab oil millionaires, merchant bankers and TV stars are said to be among those who use the sex services provided at Dr Horridge's establishments and paid by credit card!
- (He hiccups)
- Is that elbow playing you up again?
I'll just get something for supper.
Oh, have you got any money, Guthrie?
Here you are.
Haven't you been going it a bit on the credit card?
Here, let me.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
(Coughs)
American Express?
Ah.
My name is Featherstone.
Mr Justice Featherstone.
I...
No, not Justice-Featherstone with a hyphen.
My name is Featherstone, and I'm a justice.
I'm a judge, that is.
(Chuckles) Oh, well, I've got into a bit of a muddle and I've paid with my credit card when I should have paid cash.
I was wondering whether I could go and pay cash now, get my credit card slip back, and you needn't have any record of it, as it was just a question of personal accounting.
Do I make myself clear?
Oh, I don't?
(Knocking) Ready for the off, My Lord?
Er, yes.
Norman, look, I seem to have made a mistake with my credit card.
- You're... you're not Norman.
- No, My Lord, I'm Harold.
Oh, Norman's left the service.
It seemed to happen rather sudden.
He'd got another job, somewhere up north, I believe.
I'd better get in touch with him.
- Something urgent, is it?
- No!
No, nothing urgent at all!
I'd just like to keep in touch with him.
He's quite a character, old Norman.
- Wasn't he?
- Hm?
Oh, quite a character, yes, My Lord.
- (Chuckles) Elbow better, is it?
- My elbow?
Norman told us about your elbow.
No, nothing at all!
My elbow never felt better in its life!
(Guthrie) Um... excuse me?
- The health centre?
- Cleared up and gone.
- The lease was up anyway.
- AII... all gone?
Everything, even the sauna.
Course, we're still getting enquiries.
- Er... even the credit cards?
- Sorry, guv, don't take them.
Got some lovely juicy satsumas, though, for cash.
- # For me, what has all... # - (Guthrie) Claude Erskine-Brown!
Ah!
Judge!
Ah, always so good to see a chap from one's old chambers.
I see your wife was in the Court of Appeal the other day.
Ah, yes, yes.
Philly's always in the Court of Appeal.
And Rumpole?
What's old Rumpole doing?
Something sordid as usual.
- Distasteful?
- Downright disgusting.
Rumpole's cases tend to lower the tone at Number Three Equity Court.
Take this one he's doing at the moment.
- Massage parlours.
- Oh, dear.
Yes, very distasteful.
Rumpole's acting for the King of the Massage Parlours.
He thinks it a joke.
But it's not, is it, Erskine-Brown?
It's not a joke at all.
You know, I can't pretend that my marriage is all champagne and opera.
We've had our difficulties from time to time, Philly and I, I admit.
But, thank heavens, I've never had to resort to massage parlours.
I simply can't understand it.
No!
No, well, it's a complete mystery to me, of course.
That sort of thing lowers the tone of chambers.
Of course it does, Claude.
Of course it does.
The honour of Equity Court has always been very... important to me, as you know.
Perhaps I should invite Rumpole to lunch, have a word on the subject.
- What subject?
- Massage.
(Laughs) No, I mean...
I mean chambers, of course.
Mm.
Oysters for Mr Rumpole, and I'll take the soup of the day.
Mr Rumpole will have the grouse, and, er...
I'II...
I'll settle for the club hamburger.
And I thought Chablis Premier Cru to start with, and the Château Talbot '77, if that's all right with you, Horace.
Thank you.
What's the matter, Judge?
You won the pools?
Ha-ha-ha!
No.
It's just that one gets so few opportunities to entertain the chaps from one's old chambers.
Ha-ha-ha.
Claude Erskine-Brown was telling me that you're doing this case on...
- A beauty parlour?
- Oh, massage parlours.
Oh, dear.
Yes, massage parlours.
In this case, the True Line Health Centres.
I suppose some of these places are quite respectable and above board.
A chap might pop in because he'd got...
A touch of housemaid's knee?
Yes.
Yes, something of... of that sort.
Or was so innocent and unsuspecting that he shouldn't be allowed off the lead?
Why do you say that?
To your average British jury, the expression "massage parlour" means only one thing.
- What?
- Hanky-panky.
Oho!
Oh, you think that, do you?
Everyone does.
- Hanky-panky?
- In practically every case.
Rumpole.
Horace.
Let me top you up with the Chablis.
I take it you're defending in this case?
- What else would I be doing?
- Yes, of course.
As defending counsel, you're going to see the prosecuting evidence.
Oh, I've seen most of that already.
- Have you?
How very interesting.
- Mm.
Very funny.
- Funny?
- Extremely funny.
Some very important people used my client's establishments.
Nobs.
Bigwigs.
Big... wigs, Horace?
Most respectable citizens.
D'you know what they've done?
You won't believe this.
They actually used their credit cards to pay.
Have you heard of anything more totally dotty?
Ha-ha-ha!
Dotty.
No, not at all.
So all their names are in the evidence, plain for all to see.
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Thank you.
All this evidence needn't necessarily, thank you, be put before the jury.
Oh, no, no, by all means.
Indeed not.
Only a few choice nuggets.
The cream of the collection.
Should make for an afternoon's harmless fun.
Not fun for the big...
bigwigs involved, Horace.
Well, if they were so idiotic as to use their credit cards...
Mm.
Don't you find all this criminal work rather exhausting?
It's a killer.
Only, occasionally, a bit of evidence comes up that makes the whole thing worthwhile.
(Rumpole chuckles)
Have you ever thought of relaxing a little?
Say, on the circuit bench?
Circuit bench?
You must be joking.
Anyway, I'm too old.
I could have word with the powers-that-be.
They might ask you to sit as an assistant recorder on a more-or-less permanent basis.
Hundred and fifty quid a day, and absolutely no worries.
Assistant recorder?
Why on earth should they offer me that?
As a tribute, Horace, to the tactful way you always conduct your defences.
Tactful?
It's the first time anyone's called me that.
I've always found you extremely tactful in court, and discreet.
Oysters all right, are they?
Oh, yes, Judge, indeed.
Absolutely nothing wrong with the oysters.
(Rumpole) 'Assistant recorder?
'Why on earth should I want that?
'I don't judge people.
That's not my trade.
I defend 'em.
'AII the same, 150 smackers a day!
'
Mr Rumpole!
Norman.
I used to be the usher in Mr Justice Featherstone's court.
- Of course.
- I've just been to collect my cards.
- Judge's elbow better?
- It seems to be recovered.
Terrible pain he was in.
I put him on to a place where he'd get a bit of relief.
Get down to the deep fibres.
Get the bones stretched.
- You recommended a place?
- Wife's niece works there.
Nice little establishment.
Very hygienically run.
- What place?
- Sorry, Mr Rumpole.
My number 11!
What place did you rec...
(Door opens)
- Just looked in to inspect your books...
- Excuse me.
...and the PAYE forms of all employees of chambers.
Plus the petty cash vouchers for coffee consumed in the clerk's room.
(Sniggers)
On Mr Ballard's instructions, Henry.
I asked Brinsley Lampitt, prosecuting, for a shufti at the documents.
Accounts, bank statements, all the gubbins.
Exercise your talents, make a list of them, please, Miss P.
With special attention to the credit card records.
- Are they gonna help us?
- Not sure.
- Just want to pop in and see Henry.
- Right.
Henry, a word with...
Oh, hello, Hearthrug.
Sorry you had to miss the meeting.
What did I miss?
Have you replaced me with a reliable computer?
We did pass a resolution about standards of appearance.
Old macs are not acceptable now, over a black jacket and striped trousers.
Striped trousers?
- (Tuts)
- I quite agree, Mr Rumpole.
- I'm with you on this one.
- I hoped you might be.
Together we will contrive to scupper the abominable Hearthrug.
It'll take a bit of working out, Mr Ballard being so keen.
Leave "Ballard" to me.
If I can leave something to you.
- I'll do my best.
What exactly?
- Miss Osgood.
Your co-star in amateur dramatics, who arranges the lists down the Bailey.
We're playing opposite each other in "Brief Encounter".
Encounter her, Henry.
Drop a word in her shell-like ear about the massage parlour case.
What we need is a sympathetic judge.
(Humming tune) (Knocking at door)
- Coffee, My Lord.
- Oh, thank you.
Harold, isn't it?
Yes, My Lord.
I've brought you a few biscuits.
Thank you.
Should be lively in court this morning.
Lively?
Why?
What's on today?
Your clerk was telling me, they might call some of the girls to give evidence.
- Girls?
- From the massage parlours.
Oh.
There now.
What have you done?
Gentlemen, I feel very strongly that I should not try this case, that I should retire and leave it to some other judge.
(Clears throat) Yes, well, there it is.
I'll rise now.
May one ask why, My Lord?
- May you ask what, Mr Rumpole?
- Why, My Lord.
I hope it's not about my client.
Oh, no, it's got nothing to do with him.
I...
I can't imagine Your Lordship knows my client.
Know him?
Most certainly not.
Well, not that I've got anything against knowing your client, if I did, which I don't!
Then, with the greatest respect, My Lord, where's the difficulty?
- Where is the difficulty, Mr Rumpole?
- If Your Lordship pleases.
Mr Lampitt, do you wish to know where the difficulty is?
If Your Lordship pleases.
It's a private matter, as you well know, Mr Rumpole.
If I know, My Lord, it can't be exactly private.
Oh, very well.
Perhaps I should make this clear in open court.
The other day, I had lunch at my club with the counsel for the defence.
The oysters were excellent.
- I'm very grateful to Your Lordship.
- (Usher) Silence!
And during the course of that lunch,
I happened to discuss this case, in purely general terms, with the counsel for the defence.
(Rumpole) Is that all, My Lord?
- (Guthrie) Yes.
Isn't that enough?
- My Lord?
- Mr Lampitt?
- We've had a word about this case.
And they object to my sitting?
Quite right.
No, My Lord, they've no objection.
A conversation with Mr Rumpole in purely general terms couldn't prejudice you in any way.
Not in any way, My Lord, and it was in entirely general terms.
In fact, the prosecution wish Your Lordship to retain the case.
So does the defence.
Otherwise there might be a delay finding a judge.
We'd have to fix a new date.
- It would be a waste of public money.
- Public money?
In view of the Lord Chancellor's warning about the cost of Legal Aid.
Mr Rumpole, Mr Lampitt are you insisting that I try this case?
With great respect, My Lord, yes.
That is what it comes to, My Lord.
Very well.
- Shall I put the charges, My Lord?
- Oh, yes, Mr Ashby, if you insist!
(He sighs)
- Good day in court, Guthrie?
- No, Marigold.
It was not a good day in court.
Marigold?
Don't you long to get away from all this?
I mean, into the sun.
A fellow I was at school with runs a little bar in Ibiza.
Now, wouldn't you like to run a little bar in Ibiza?
I'd hate to run a little bar in Ibiza.
Whatever are you talking about?
Well, you don't want to hang about in Kensington.
In the rain!
Married to a judge who's away all day sitting.
I like you being a judge, Guthrie.
I like you being away all day sitting.
What's wrong with Kensington?
It's handy for Harrod's.
- Marigold?
- Yes, Guthrie.
I was just thinking about that cabinet minister who had to resign because of that scandal.
Did he run a little bar in Ibiza?
No.
It's just that I can't help thinking about his wife, the way she stood by him.
Through thick and thin.
Would you stand by me, Marigold, through thick and thin?
What's the scandal, Guthrie?
(Chuckles) Oh, nothing.
No, it's just a theoretical question.
(He sniffs) Ah.
Just wondered whether you'd stand by me.
Don't count on it, Guthrie.
Don't ever count on it.
- Oh, working late?
- Yeah.
Rumpole often leaves the lights on.
It's a question of cash flow in chambers.
- What's all that?
- Documents in the massage case.
Accounts.
- Rumpole wants me to make a list.
- I could help.
- No, really.
- Yes, yes, please.
Do let me.
Aren't you too busy, doing a time and motion study of the coffee machine?
- You're young, aren't you?
- So they tell me.
Don't you want to change the system?
It's positively archaic.
Henry taking ten percent, and Rumpole going round in an old mac from Oxfam, on about the liberty of the subject and the burden of proof.
Not keen on the liberty of the subject?
He got the speech in the same job lot as the mac, and that appalling hat.
- Ha-ha-ha!
- What?
All this.
Acres and acres of naked flesh being pounded every day.
The day of the Rumpole is over.
We should provide a service industry based on sound legal technology.
Here, can I have these?
- Why are you doing this?
- What?
Helping me.
- Why do you think?
- I just hope...
Nothing to do with my eyes, is it?
Erskine-Brown took me to the opera.
Kept telling me I had nice eyes.
Erskine-Brown's old-fashioned.
Just because I'm a woman!
I bet nobody mentions your eyes.
Hoskins said I can only do petty larceny and divorce.
That's all women are fit for.
Yes, well, out of the ark, Hoskins.
Look, Liz, I know we often disagree...
Do you?
I'm standing as a Conservative, and your father's Red Ron from North London.
But we're both young.
We both want to see things changed.
When we finish this, buy yourself a Chinese at the Golden Gate.
Why should I?
Well, I could buy one too.
And we might even eat them at the same table.
Promise not to mention your eyes.
- Can if you want to.
- Mention your eyes?
No, you fool, eat your Chinese at my table.
Hearthrug, what's this?
Another deputation about my tailoring?
- Just helping out your junior.
- How considerate of you.
I'll take over now, if you don't mind, after a stop at Pommeroy's for refuelling.
- You two young things go home.
- Thanks.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I'II, er... see you downstairs, Liz.
I, um...
Yes, I was going to ask you about Henry.
What about Henry?
I was looking at his PAYE returns.
He is married, isn't he?
To a lady tax inspector in Bromley.
So what is his relationship with Dianne the typist?
- Friendly, I imagine.
- Just friendly?
That is a question I've never cared to ask.
There are lots of questions like that, aren't there?
Er...
Detective Constable Marten.
That was not a note you made at the time?
No, sir.
When the incident occurred, you were deprived of your clothing.
And, no doubt, of your notebook.
I made the note on my return to the station.
After these exciting events had taken place?
After the incident complained of, yes.
And your recollection was still clear?
- Quite clear, Mr Rumpole.
- Hm.
Now, it all began with the lady therapist?
The masseuse, yes.
Passing an entirely innocent remark?
She asked me if I was going anywhere nice on holiday.
- She ask you that?
- Yes, my lord.
And up to that time, this was a perfectly straightforward routine massage?
I informed the young lady that I had a pain in the knee from playing football.
Was that the truth?
- No, My Lord.
- Oh, then you were lying, Officer.
Yes, if you put it that way.
What other way is there of putting it?
You're an officer who is prepared to lie!
In the course of duty, yes!
And submit to sexual advances on massage tables, in the course of duty?
- (Jury chuckles)
- Yes.
- Yes, very well.
- Just one moment, Mr Rumpole.
- Perhaps I can help.
- Of course, My Lord.
When the massage started, you said you had a pain in your knee?
- Yes.
- From tennis?
Football, My Lord.
Oh, yes, of course, football.
Yes, I'm much obliged.
And as far as she knew, that may have been the truth.
She might have believed it.
As far as you know, quite a number of respectable, happily married men visit these health centres simply because they have sustained an injury during various sporting activities, tennis, football, and the like?
Some may, I suppose, My Lord.
Many may.
- Yes.
- Yes!
- Very well.
Thank you, Mr Rumpole.
- Thank you, My Lord.
If Your Lordship pleases.
So at first sight, this appeared to be an entirely genuine health centre?
- At first sight, yes.
- An entirely genuine health centre.
- Those were your words, Mr Rumpole?
- My exact words, My Lord.
You are making a note of them for the jury?
Oh, I am indeed, Mr Rumpole.
I am indeed.
All was as pure as the driven snow.
In fact it was the routine, proper treatment for a knee injury, until you made a somewhat distasteful suggestion.
- Distasteful?
- Remind the jury what you said, Officer.
As you lay on that massage table, clad only in a towel.
I said, "Well, my dear, how about a bit of the other?"
(Chuckling)
- The what, Officer?
- The other, My Lord.
The other what?
- Just the other.
- I don't understand.
You were using an expression from the vernacular.
- Meaning what, Mr Rumpole?
- Hanky-panky, My Lord.
Oh.
I'm much obliged.
Oh, I hope that's clear to members of the jury.
So you suggested that some form of sexual intimacy might be possible?
I did, My Lord, putting it in terms she would understand.
- And that suggestion came from you?
- In the first instance, yes.
And if you hadn't made this... appalling suggestion, the massage might have continued quite inoffensively?
- It might have done.
- To the benefit of your knee!
There was nothing wrong with my knee.
No, of course not.
You were lying about that, weren't you?
During the course of this entire transaction, you saw absolutely nothing of my client?
- Nothing at all, My Lord.
- No.
Thank you, Officer.
Just one moment.
A question.
When you asked the young lady about "the other", what did she reply?
Her reply was, My Lord, "That'll be £20."
Yes.
We don't need to keep this officer, do we?
The witness may be released.
Do you know why the judge is batting so strenuously for the defence?
Must be my irresistible charm, old love.
I don't often bump into you in Harrod's, Mrs Rumpole.
No, I don't get to Harrod's as often as a judge's wife.
Only after Rumpole's had a money brief, as he calls it.
We usually shop in Marks.
Sugar?
No.
No, I've got my boring little tablets.
I wanted to buy myself a hat for when Rumpole's sitting.
I might be up beside him, occasionally, on the bench.
- Rumpole sitting?
- Yes.
It was your judge that mentioned it to him, when they had lunch at the Sheridan Club.
Rumpole says it rather depends on him behaving himself in this case, but if he's a bit careful, well, deputy county court judge for all the world to see.
One in the eye for Erskine-Brown.
That's what he's always wanted.
Guthrie seems to want to give up sitting.
He talks of going to Ibiza and opening a bar.
- Ibiza?
- Full of package tours and Spaniards.
Oh, dear.
Rumpole and I wouldn't like that at all.
Tell me, Mrs Rumpole...
May I call you Hilda?
You and Guthrie always have, Marigold.
Guthrie's been most peculiar.
I wonder if I ought to take him to the doctor.
Oh, dear.
Nothing terribly serious, I hope?
He keeps asking me if I'll stand by him through thick and thin.
Would you do that for Rumpole?
Rumpole and I have been together for nearly 40 years now.
- Yes?
- Yes.
Yes, I'd stand by him, of course.
Would you?
But thick and thin?
No, I'm not so sure about that.
Neither am I, Hilda.
I'm not sure at all.
Have a scone, dear, and let's hope it never comes to that.
However much longer is this case going to last?
We've only had two days so far.
As you said, Rumpole, we're under pressure to cut down on public spending.
Now, we shouldn't delay matters by introducing a lot of documents.
Do you intend putting in any documents, Lampitt?
Just Dr Horridge's bank accounts.
He was making a hefty profit out of this organisation.
His bank accounts?
Just his bank accounts?
I don't think anything else is necessary.
(Chuckles) Oh, no, absolutely not.
I do so agree.
I mean, I did hear people used their credit cards.
You don't intend putting in credit card slips or anything of that sort?
No, we needn't bother with that.
No, absolutely not.
I do so agree.
I'm sure you agree too, don't you, Rumpole?
Um... yes.
That is...
- Not quite, Judge.
- Not quite?
- Regarding the credit card evidence.
- Yes?
- I would like to keep my options open.
- Keep them open?
My argument is that anyone who pays with his credit card in a disorderly house must be completely insane.
That's your argument?
So the fact that credit cards were used may indicate my client's innocence.
It's something I'll have to consider, Judge, very seriously.
Oh, yes.
Yes, I suppose you will.
Is that all you wanted to see us about, Judge?
- How much longer?
- Don't worry, Judge, it'll soon be over.
Thank you.
(Door closes)
Este vaso no está limpio.
(Sniffs) This glass is not clean.
Este vaso no está limpio!
Marigold Featherstone said the Judge is terribly depressed.
- What's eating him, I wonder.
- He won't be sitting much longer.
Just think of that.
You'll be sitting.
The Featherstones will be running a bar in Ibiza.
- By the way, I meant to tell you.
- Mm?
There's a chambers party.
Erskine-Brown's organising it.
We all know what that's for, don't we?
- Do we?
- I've bought a hat...
They're trying to get me to buy one too.
...so that I can sit beside you sometimes when you're on your bench.
For God's sake, Hilda, don't do that.
I mean, all that sitting, you'll be uncomfortable.
Oh.
American Express.
Oh, yes.
Yes, they've...
They've paid in the credit card.
The True Life Health Centre.
True...
True Life?
True Life, that...
That's not the name in the indictment, is it?
You, Maurice Horridge, are charged that you at the True Line Health Centre...
True Line.
True Line!
Not True Life.
I'm in the clear.
- I'm in the clear!
I'm...
I'm in the clear!
- My Lord?
Oh!
Harold!
- Is Your Lordship ready for court?
- Absolutely ready!
For court!
Dr Horridge, if any of the young ladies misconducted themselves...
They wouldn't.
I'm sure they wouldn't.
- They were spiritually trained.
- Yes, quite so.
But if by some chance they did, was it with your knowledge and approval?
Certainly not, My Lord.
Quite certainly not.
- Come now.
- Yes, My Lord?
Come, come!
We've heard the evidence of Detective Constable Marten, that he suggested to one of your masseurs something of the other.
- Something or other, My Lord?
- No, Doctor...
Horridge.
Something of the other.
I'm sure you know perfectly well what that means.
To which she replied, "That will be £20."
That's a scandalous state of affairs.
- You agree?
- Yes, My Lord.
Are you honestly trying to tell this jury that you had no idea whatever that that was going on in your "health centre"?
No idea at all, My Lord.
And you didn't make it your business to find out?
Not specifically, My Lord.
Not specifically.
Didn't you realise that very many perfectly decent respectable citizens, husbands, ratepayers, might have been trapped into the most ghastly trouble simply because they'd injured an elbow?
- I mean a knee!
- I suppose so, My Lord.
(Guthrie) You suppose so!
The jury will have heard your answer.
What are you doing, Mr Rumpole?
- I'm testing the wind, My Lord.
- The wind?
Yes, it seems to have changed the direction.
Rumpole.
- Are you dead, Rumpole?
- (Rumpole) Uh?
Er... not dead, just laid out spiritually.
Oh.
It's you, Hearthrug.
I was looking for Ballard.
Go and look somewhere else.
I was going to tell him about Henry.
- (Grunts) What about Henry?
- Kissing Dianne in the clerk's room.
- It's just not on.
- Ah.
Yes, I agree.
- Do you?
- Yes.
I thought you'd say it was all part of the freedom of the subject.
Good heavens, no!
No.
They should stop rehearsing in their place of work.
- Rehearsing?
- Didn't you know?
Henry is a pillar of the Bromley Amateur Dramatics.
He's playing opposite Dianne in some light comedy, and they get so little time to rehearse.
I'll have a word with them.
- How's the housemaid's knee?
- What?
The dicky ankle, the fiddler's elbow, the bad back.
The pain in the neck.
- Suffering a lot, are you?
- I'm perfectly fit.
What, really?
What, no aches and pains at all?
- No, none whatever.
- How odd.
You've been having so much massage lately.
- What are you talking about?
- Unfortunate case.
That poor old theologian got two years, once the judge felt he had a free hand in the matter.
We were looking through the evidence, but you know all about that.
It's why you popped in the other night to give Miss Probert a helping hand.
I was looking for another name.
I kept coming across yours.
Charles Hearthstoke.
A massage every week at the Battersea Health Depot and hanky-panky parlour.
It was entirely... entirely innocent.
Then you can tell that to our learned head of chambers.
- I can't press you?
- Absolutely, sir.
Ah, Judge, good of you to come to our little gathering.
It's a pleasure to be back in one's old chambers.
- Guthrie, a drop of white?
- Thank you.
Hear you potted Rumpole's old brothel keeper straight into the pocket.
Ah, yes, rather a worrying case.
Must have been for you, extremely worrying.
There used to be a rumour going round the Temple that Helford Davis's clerk was running a disorderly house over a teashop in Chancery Lane.
Oh, dear!
The trouble was, no one could ever find it.
Oh, Judge, how I'm going to envy you!
All that sunshine.
We'd love to get away to a warmer climate, but Rumpole couldn't leave now.
He's not going to let the Lord Chancellor down.
- Lord Chancellor?
- Oh, yes.
He's expecting great things of Rumpole.
A happy retirement to you.
Oh, I'm not about to retire, Mrs Rumpole.
But Marigold distinctly told me.
Ibiza.
Well, I had thought of it.
I toyed with the idea of lounging about in a pair of shorts and a straw hat, soaking up the sun and drinking sangria.
But, no, it's my duty to carry on sitting.
Oh, Ibiza no longer necessary, Judge?
Your duty.
Yes, of course.
And Rumpole is going to be doing his duty, too.
- (Tapping glass)
- What's the party in aid of?
Mr Ballard is going to tell us now.
Welcome, welcome everyone.
Welcome, Judge.
It's delightful to have you with us.
In the life of every chambers, as in every family, changes take place, some happy, others not so happy.
The sadness first.
Charles Hearthstoke has only been with us three months.
- Three months too long.
- We all respect his energy and drive.
Charles wasn't happy with the criminal side of our work...
- Oh, dear(!
) ...he found it distasteful.
So he's joining a commercial set in Middle Temple.
We're sorry he couldn't put into practice some most interesting ideas he had.
You're not upset he's going, are you?
Shut up, Rumpole, I'm perfectly all right.
Now I come to happier news.
From time to time, the Lord Chancellor confers on tried and trusted members...
- Like Rumpole.
...the honour of assistant recorder.
So we may find ourselves before one of our colleagues and be able to discover his wisdom on the bench.
You may have Ballard before you!
- The party financed by Erskine-Brown...
- It's so kind of Claude to do this!
...is to announce, he will sit from time to time at Snaresbrook and Inner London, where we wish him every happiness.
- Claude Erskine-Brown.
- Congratulations.
He will be sitting?
Claude Erskine-Brown?
What's happened, Rumpole?
My sitting is like Ibiza, Hilda.
It's no longer necessary.
Oh!
Well done, Claude.
I've only got one bit of advice.
What's that, Rumpole?
Let everyone off?
No, something much more important.
Never pay by credit card, old love.
(thunder crashing)
(phonograph powers up)
(slow ragtime jazz playing)
(mechanical creaking)
(chimes tinkling)
(thunder crashes)
Man 1:
What's that, a $20 bill?
Man 2:
Yeah, can't you break it?
Man 1:
No, no, no, I don't make change.
Get out of here.
What do I look like-- the first national bank?
Sheesh.
Hey, mac, ah, how about some flowers for the missus?
Mm-hmm.
For that you get
A whole arrangement.
Oh, ah, don't...
I'll get it, I'll get it.
Here you go.
(groans)
(woman gasps)
Jack:
Item 39721--
Surgical scalpel, ivory and silver handle,
Late 19th century.
Oh, that's a precision instrument
Designed for one purpose...
To slice up human beings.
But not solid iron bars.
All the eyewitnesses agreed it was a small knife.
That's what makes it so incredible.
Eh, that's a long shot.
Well, it's still worth checking out.
Who bought it, anyway?
Lewis sold it to one james morgan-- 8847 beverlywood street.
Isn't there anything else in there that fits the bill?
Afraid not.
Let me find out what I can about this james morgan
Before we drop in on him, hmm?
Wait a minute, there's a note.
"legend has it that the aforementioned item
May once have been the scalpel of jack the ripper."
In the summer of 1888, he sliced the throats
Of at least five victims in london.
No one who ever saw him at work lived to tell of it.
I don't know where he is.
Jack was supposed to be here a half an hour ago.
He seemed awfully mysterious about this plan of his.
What did you learn?
Our friend, jim morgan is a thug.
He's an ex-con-- still on parole.
What was he in for?
Assault with a deadly weapon.
He was known as a craftsman with a blade.
Come on.
Can I help you?
Ah, maybe.
We're looking for a knife.
You came to the right place.
What kind of knives?
Oh, antique knives.
You come to the wrong place.
All I got are household knives, work knives, camping knives.
What about scalpels?
What do I look like, a medical supply house?
It looks like
You've got really quite an extensive collection here.
Yeah, I get by.
You wouldn't have heard anything about a victorian scalpel,
Say, circa 1888?
You wanna buy something, mac,
Or you just wanna waste my time?
You have quite a way of dealing with people.
Ryan:
Look, look, I-I got a friend,
He, uh, he owns an antique shop
And he said you bought
An antique scalpel.
Yeah, well, if I did, I don't remember.
Besides, I got receipts for everything in this place.
There's nothing here that's hot, if that's what you're driving at.
This is it!
This is just the scalpel we were looking for!
Impossible!
I sold it...
Who did you sell it to?
Hey, what do I look like, information?
Look, you said you've got receipts for everything.
Did I?
Funny, I just lost my memory.
Well, maybe this will refresh it.
Some negatives from 1979 wouldn't sit too well
With your parole board.
Need I say more?
Where did you get those?
Funny, I just lost my memory.
(sighs)
Look, mister,
I run a legit business here.
Nobody ever said you didn't.
My customers, they, uh, they like to remain anonymous.
We wouldn't tell a soul.
Well, I, I did sell a scalpel about two years ago
To a doctor.
Remember who?
Of course I remember who:
Dr. Howlett.
The dr.
Howlett?
Listen, you didn't hear nothing from me.
Listen, they call this dr.
Howlett the "miracle man".
He's been on the cover of all the news magazines,
All the major talk shows.
He's turned surgery into an art, not to mention a big business.
He takes all the most hopeless cases and then he cures them.
Ah!
The only thing I want to know
Is where did you get those negatives?
At the zoo.
(laughs)
They're of you and ryan at the monkey cage.
See, chances are a guy like morgan,
Any year you pick, is liable to be hiding something.
Well, sure worked.
(french accent):
But of course.
Let's go visit the good dr.
Howlett.
Howlett:
A man with a knife in his hand cuts open a second man
From sternum to pubis.
Is the man arrested?
No.
Why not?
Because the man is a surgeon.
That, ladies and gentlemen, is power.
But it's responsibility, as well.
We must learn to do our job not only correctly,
But miraculously.
Man:
Heartbeat stabilized, dr.
Howlett.
Let's put a penrose drain in.
That's it, close her up.
(applause)
Well, vince, one more notch for your belt.
It's really nothing, patricia.
A minor miracle, something on the scale of water into wine.
Here he comes.
Oh.
Adam.
Well...
Of course we've all heard of dr.
Howlett.
His reputation has preceded him.
But as head of surgery here, I for one, didn't believe it.
No one could live up to that reputation,
Except a miracle man.
Performing surgery on hopeless cases
And never losing a single patient?
So I was wrong.
Dr. Howlett, welcome aboard.
That was a helluva debut.
Thank you.
I'm happy to be the newest member
Of ravenbrook's illustrious faculty.
As some of you may know,
I began my career in medical school at this hospital.
And I'm delighted if my talents
Can now help re-guild this somewhat
Tarnished institution.
Thank you.
Ryan:
I don't understand it.
How can a small hospital like ravenbrook afford
A heavy hitter like, um, howlett?
Well, they really can't.
But from everything I've been hearing,
They really can't afford not to have him.
They've been suffering some serious setbacks lately.
Like what?
Oh, outmoded equipment,
And, uh, poor patient care.
They've had bad press,
Even some, uh, malpractice suits,
And that's not to mention,
Uh, some minor scandals that have happened among the staff.
So, having howlett there can put them back
On the, uh, map again.
Well, they've certainly got the best, haven't they?
And ravenbrook becomes
The most important hospital in the country.
Uh-huh.
All right.
We know what's in it for ravenbrook.
What's in it for howlett?
Oh, oh, look, he just loves the limelight.
He can take a place like this and turn it
Into a really top-notch institution single-handedly.
Ho!
Sounds like an okay guy to me.
Well, his critics say that he's turning medicine
Into a three-ring circus.
But, look, I mean,
There's no denying his perfect success rate
And all the good work he's done.
No, there's no denying that.
But you know, it's ironic.
Jack the ripper was supposed to have been a doctor, too.
Woman (over p.A.):
Dr. Cordina to emergency.
So tell me, what does a medical superstar do
In his time off?
Oh, I wouldn't want to bore you with my little hobbies.
On the contrary, you fascinate me, dr.
Howlett.
As your professor, I do remember you from med school,
And given your performance there, I'm amazed
That you ever qualified as a surgeon.
My track record does speak for itself.
And do I detect a note of jealousy?
Jealous of what?
My reputation, the admiration of my peers,
The press I've been receiving.
Let's make it perfectly clear, vince.
I do not approve
Of your showbiz approach to surgery.
Like it or not, patricia, it works.
400.
Clear.
Nothing.
400 ms.
Nurse:
400.
Nurse, we're looking for dr.
Howlett.
Clear.
His airway's clogging.
Dr. Howlett.
Yeah, he went that way.
Thanks.
You can catch him if you hurry.
Nurse:
Carotid pulse is thready, regular 180 over...
No!
Let me go!
Howlett!
I'll follow him.
He's a killer!
Stop him!
No!
Let me go!
I gotta do it before he kills again!
Stop him!
Find micki and meet me in the waiting room.
I'm gonna talk to that lady.
(screaming)
Woman (over p.A.):
Nurse rodgers to ward 7...
Dr. Johnson to station six west, please.
Lemme outta here!
You have no right to keep me in here.
No right!
(indistinct announcement over p.A.)
Jean?
(gasps)
Is this your daughter?
I remember when she was just a little baby.
So shy.
She'd bury herself in my skirts
If anyone talked to her.
And he carved her up.
Howlett?
She was in med school,
Wanted to be a doctor.
Like him.
She worshipped him,
Read every book he wrote.
When she heard he was coming to town,
She went off...
To where he was staying.
Said she'd talk to him if it was the last thing she did.
2:00 a.M., the phone rings.
They found her
In an alley--
Most of her.
Jean, how did you know it was howlett?
I didn't know,
But the cops, the cops had nothing.
I had to do something,
So I started following him,
Keeping tabs...
The clippings you had in your bag...
Everywhere he went, another killing.
Or two.
It was no big deal, just back-page stuff.
I just kept waiting for him to make that one slip
So someone would listen to me...
But he was too smart...
And I couldn't let it go on.
(whispers):
It's okay.
Just one more thing.
What about the weapon?
You're no doctor.
Who are you?
I'm a friend.
A friend?
Then let me outta here.
I can't.
Not just yet.
I thought so.
You're in on it.
Like all of 'em.
I'm gonna kill you, you hear me?
Kill you!
Dr. Howlett?
Yes?
How do you do?
I'm lucy bender,
Supply and services here at ravenbrook.
Just, um, checking to make sure everything's all right.
Oh!
I see they did give you that leather chair.
Yes, everything's just fine.
Thank you.
Well, great.
If you need anything else,
Just call me.
There you are.
Oh, shh!
Listen, he's got it, ryan, I saw it.
He's in there now?
Yes.
Okay, I'll keep an eye on howlett.
You tell jack.
He's in the waiting room, okay?
All right.
Jack...
Where's ryan?
Watching howlett.
He's got the scalpel.
Micki, howlett's killed dozens of people already.
If he so much as suspects that ryan knows something...
(indistinct announcement over p.A.)
(indistinct announcement over p.A.)
Dr. Howlett?
Micki.
The scalpel's gone.
And look at this.
What?
According to his surgery schedule,
Howlett's not even down to operate again today.
So where did he go with the scalpel?
Micki, I think that jean's right.
Howlett is a mass murderer.
The question is why?
Well, he's gone with the scalpel
And I'd say it's a pretty good guess
That he's using it not only to operate but also to kill.
The up side and the down side of the curse.
Exactly.
I think the scalpel acts
As a sort of rechargeable battery, in that it...
If it doesn't kill for a certain period of time,
I think it runs down, loses its ability to-to heal.
Slowly at first, and then...
Ryan.
Yeah, you're right.
(metal doors clang)
I did see dr.
Howlett a few minutes ago,
But, I really couldn't tell you where he went.
Well, thank you.
Which way now?
Jack:
Not that way, obviously.
(metallic crashing)
Could be anywhere.
(metallic crash)
(labored breathing)
Ryan!
Ryan (muffled):
Micki?
!
I'm in here!
Ryan?
Micki!
Oh!
(both sighing)
Where's howlett?
(grunts)
(groans)
(yells)
(thuds)
Micki:
Jack!
Jack!
(screams)
(indistinct announcement over p.A.)
(indistinct announcement over p.A.)
(air hissing)
(sirens wailing in distance)
Jack'd say "where's the fire"?
Uh, hello.
I'm dr.
Price, chief of surgery.
We're trying to get mr.
Marshak stabilized.
Does he have any family?
No.
Uh, we're his family.
Well, um...
May need one of you to sign the release for surgery.
Surgery?
Is it that serious?
Yes, I'm afraid it's very serious.
You just hold on here.
I can't believe it.
Not jack...
That bastard howlett.
Wait a minute, I'll be right back.
Ryan, where are you going?
I gotta do something.
We need you to operate tonight.
I'm not available.
I thought you'd jump at the chance to do this one.
Why?
Who is it?
It's no one important.
Just one of those patients
That you profess to care so much about,
Who has no chance of living unless you perform a miracle.
I can't operate tonight.
You're here to turn the reputation
Of this hospital around, vince,
And this surgery is precisely what will put
Ravenbrook back on the map.
There'll be other cases.
Yes, there will be,
But I'm afraid the press has got hold of this one.
They're already here,
Expecting to see the miracle man in action.
I know you won't disappoint them.
What time?
8:30.
All right...
I'll do it.
(siren wails in distance)
Strap's too tight.
I'm losing circulation in my arms.
Won't you be a dear and loosen it a tad, will ya?
I promise I won't tell.
(loud thud)
Mr. Marshak has an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
What?
What is that?
Well, it's a weakness in the artery leading from the heart.
Uh, probably due to the severity of his fall.
It's like a bubble waiting to explode.
It's almost always fatal.
Well, what can you do?
Operate as soon as possible.
Fortunately, we now have the best surgeon
In the country on call.
He's agreed to do the surgery tonight, with your consent.
Now, you may have heard of him.
He's something of a miracle worker.
Howlett?
Hey, skippy, let's go to heidi's house.
Her parents are gone for the night.
Right on.
Let's go.
(indistinct announcement over p.A.)
(phone rings)
Psych emerg, firestone speaking.
I'm sorry, dr.
Masden is here.
He's been waiting for 20 minutes
And the ambulance hasn't arrived.
Well, I've called down to emergency
And they don't know anything about it either.
What do you want me to do about it?
All right, I'll give him a call,
But this is the second time this has happened this week.
(scoffs) I'm sorry.
I don't know what to do about it.
Well, you can talk to my superior.
Fine.
Fine!
Thank you.
Bye.
(sighs)
(pager beeping)
Woman:
Dr. Howlett, call the hospital, please.
Dr...
You're late, dr.
Howlett.
This is not a tennis match.
The results are in:
Ekg, ct scan, flat plate.
You might want to look at them.
My scalpel, where is it?
!
I got it.
How's jack?
Hmm?
Ryan, you've gotta give it back.
What are you talking about?
There's only one surgeon who can save him now.
Howlett (mutters):
Where is it?
Where is it?
!
Get hold of yourself, vincent!
It's gotta be here.
You have got a patient in there!
He hasn't got time for your emotional problems!
Excuse me, dr.
Howlett?
I think this is yours.
(labored breathing through ventilator)
There they are, doctor,
Your admiring public.
We're ready, doctor.
Let's get on with it.
No opening remarks tonight?
No.
Scalpel.
Anything wrong, doctor?
No, nothing's wrong.
Don't worry about me, doctor.
I'm not gonna lose one.
Not now...
Not ever.
(steady beeping)
You never know how much somebody means to you
(voice breaks):
Until you just might...
Me and my folks, we never got along.
Always treated me like I had a screw loose.
They never let me do anything important,
But jack, he was the first one
To act like I had something on the ball.
Give me normal saline through the cdp.
So is it good or bad if an operation takes a long time?
Ryan, I've been thinking.
No matter what happens to jack,
We can't let howlett get away.
I mean, if there were to be any more killings,
It would be our fault,
And that would be the last thing jack would want.
Hi.
Would you like some coffee?
Thanks.
Thanks.
d d
(labored breathing through ventilator)
We've done everything we can for him.
Doctor.
Powell, I don't want anyone else
Dealing with this patient's post-op.
I'll supervise his medication personally.
We don't want any surprises.
Doctor, I can take that.
No.
I'll take care of it myself.
Mr. Marshak is in post op
Until the anesthetic wears off.
You can see him then.
Oh-ho.
Thank god.
Uh, where's howlett?
Dr. Howlett?
Why?
Uh, we just want to thank him for all the help he's been.
Oh, well, um, I left him in scrub.
He probably wants to have a look at his patient before he leaves.
He wanted to supervise the post-op personally.
(monitor beeping)
(indistinct announcement over p.A.)
(indistinct announcement over p.A.)
(labored breathing through ventilator)
(indistinct announcement over p.A.)
(labored breathing through ventilator)
Howlett.
You turn around and face me.
I take it you don't want my autograph.
You killed my daughter.
Now it's your turn.
Come closer.
You don't want to miss now.
(loud clang)
Yes.
That's right.
(stabs) (screams)
Micki:
Jack!
Jean:
Don't mind me, get howlett!
He couldn't have gone far.
Shh!
Keep your ears open.
Look out!
(yelling)
(loud clang)
(bolt slides)
(panting)
(crackling and rattling)
Ryan, look!
Ryan:
We're trapped.
Did you really think you could stop me?
Don't you know who I am?
He with the power to give life
And take it away.
(screams) (thuds)
Come on!
Let's get out of here.
Run, micki, run!
Oh.
We need a weapon.
Tell me about it.
It's better than nothing.
Hide behind there.
Micki, hide behind this.
Howlett!
(grunting)
(groans)
(grunting)
(grunting)
(groans)
(clicking)
(groans)
(thud)
You forget,
There's two of us!
Forget?
No.
How can I forget you?
I'm just saving the best for last.
(yelling)
(moans)
(loud crackling)
(panting)
(sighs)
Micki:
It's good to have you back.
We missed you.
Thank you, my dear micki.
No more hospitals for me,
Or that scalpel, I hope.
By the way, you did put it away, hmm?
Yes, jack.
We put it in the vault.
It's safe and sound.
Mmm.
How did it go?
Jean's on a plane back home.
She should be there in a couple of hours.
How is she?
Oh,
She's okay.
She got what she came for.
I think it's high time that I went back to work.
No, you hold on now.
You want to go anywhere, you let me know.
I'll wheel you there.
This is perfectly ridiculous, ryan.
I'm capable of going under my own steam.
You heard what the doctor
Said.
Do you think
I'm ever gonna want to hear
What a doctor says again?
Well, now, howlett did a good job...
What?
Are you kidding?
I mean,
The best part of all is with him out of the way,
He won't be sending you a bill.
(laughing) (laughing)
What's that, a $20 bill?
Yeah, can't you break it?
No, no, no, I don't make change.
Get out of here.
What do I look like...
the first national bank?
Sheesh.
Hey, Mac, ah, how about some flowers for the missus?
Mm-hmm.

Oh, ah, don't...

He's turned surgery into an art, not to mention a big business.
He takes all the most hopeless cases and then he cures them.
Ah!
The only thing I want to know is where did you get those negatives?
At the zoo.
They're of you and Ryan at the monkey cage.
See, chances are a guy like Morgan, any year you pick, is liable to be hiding something.
Well, sure worked.
But of course.
Let's go visit the good dr.
Howlett.
A man with a knife in his hand cuts open a second man from sternum to pubis.
Is the man arrested?
No.
Why not?
Because the man is a surgeon.
That, ladies and gentlemen, is power.
But it's responsibility, as well.
We must learn to do our job not only correctly, but miraculously.
Heartbeat stabilized, dr.
Howlett.
Let's put a Penrose drain in.
That's it, close her up.
Well, Vince, one more notch for your belt.
It's really nothing, Patricia.
A minor miracle, something on the scale of water into wine.
Here he comes.
Oh.
Adam.
Well...
Of course we've all heard of dr.
Howlett.
His reputation has preceded him.
But as head of surgery here, I, for one, didn't believe it.
No one could live up to that reputation, except a miracle man.
Performing surgery on hopeless cases and never losing a single patient?
So I was wrong.
Dr. Howlett, welcome aboard.
That was a helluva debut.
Thank you.
I'm happy to be the newest member
Of Ravenbrook's illustrious faculty.
As some of you may know,
I began my career in medical school at this hospital.
And I'm delighted if my talents can now help re-guild this somewhat tarnished institution.
Thank you.
I don't understand it.
How can a small hospital like Ravenbrook afford a heavy hitter like, um, Howlett?
Well, they really can't.
But from everything I've been hearing, they really can't afford not to have him.
They've been suffering some serious setbacks lately.
Like what?
Oh, outmoded equipment, and, uh, poor patient care.
They've had bad press, even some, uh, malpractice suits,
And that's not to mention, uh, some minor scandals that have happened among the staff.
So, having Howlett there can put them back on the, uh, map again.
Well, they've certainly got the best, haven't they?
And Ravenbrook becomes the most important hospital in the country.
Uh-huh.
All right.
We know what's in it for Ravenbrook.
What's in it for Howlett?
Oh, oh, look, he just loves the limelight.
He can take a place like this and turn it into a really top-notch institution single-handedly.
Ho!
Sounds like an okay guy to me.
Well, his critics say that he's turning medicine into a three-ring circus.
But, look, I mean, there's no denying his perfect success rate and all the good work he's done.
No, there's no denying that.
But you know, it's ironic.
Jack the Ripper was supposed to have been a doctor, too.
Dr. Cordina to emergency.
So tell me, what does a medical superstar do in his time off?
Oh, I wouldn't want to bore you with my little hobbies.
On the contrary, you fascinate me, dr.
Howlett.
As your professor, I do remember you from med school, and given your performance there, I'm amazed that you ever qualified as a surgeon.
My track record does speak for itself.
And do I detect a note of jealousy?
Jealous of what?
My reputation, the admiration of my peers, the press I've been receiving.
Let's make it perfectly clear, Vince.
I do not approve of your showbiz approach to surgery.
Like it or not, Patricia, it works.
400.
Clear.
Nothing.
400 ms.
400.
Nurse, we're looking for dr.
Howlett.
Clear.
His airway's clogging.
Dr. Howlett.
Yeah, he went that way.
Thanks.
You can catch him if you hurry.
Carotid pulse is thready, regular 180 over...
No!
Let me go!
Howlett!
I'll follow him.
He's a killer!
Stop him!
No!
Let me go!
I gotta do it before he kills again!
Stop him!
Find Micki and meet me in the waiting room.
I'm gonna talk to that lady.
Nurse Rodgers to ward 7...
Dr. Johnson to station six west, please.
Lemme outta here!
You have no right to keep me in here.
No right!
Jean?
Is this your daughter?
I remember when she was just a little baby.
So shy.
She'd bury herself in my skirts if anyone talked to her.
And he carved her up.
Howlett?
She was in med school, wanted to be a doctor.
Like him.
She worshipped him, read every book he wrote.
When she heard he was coming to town, she went off...
To where he was staying.
Said she'd talk to him if it was the last thing she did.
2:00 A.M., the phone rings.
They found her in an alley...
Most of her.
Jean, how did you know it was Howlett?
I didn't know, but the cops, the cops had nothing.
I had to do something,
So I started following him, keeping tabs...
The clippings you had in your bag...
Everywhere he went, another killing.
Or two.
It was no big deal, just back-page stuff.
I just kept waiting for him to make that one slip so someone would listen to me...
But he was too smart...
And I couldn't let it go on.
It's okay.
Just one more thing.
What about the weapon?
You're no doctor.
Who are you?
I'm a friend.
A friend?
Then let me outta here.
I can't.
Not just yet.
I thought so.
You're in on it.
Like all of 'em.
I'm gonna kill you, you hear me?
Kill you!
Dr. Howlett?
Yes?
How do you do?
I'm Lucy Bender, supply and services here at Ravenbrook.
Just, um, checking to make sure everything's all right.
Oh!
I see they did give you that leather chair.
Yes, everything's just fine.
Thank you.
Well, great.
If you need anything else, just call me.
There you are.
Oh, shh!
Listen, he's got it, Ryan, I saw it.
He's in there now?
Yes.
Okay, I'll keep an eye on Howlett.
You tell Jack.
He's in the waiting room, okay?
All right.
Jack...
Where's Ryan?
Watching Howlett.
He's got the scalpel.
Micki, Howlett's killed dozens of people already.
If he so much as suspects that Ryan knows something...
Dr. Howlett?
Micki.
The scalpel's gone.
And look at this.
What?
According to his surgery schedule,
Howlett's not even down to operate again today.
So where did he go with the scalpel?
Micki, I think that Jean's right.
Howlett is a mass murderer.
The question is why?
Well, he's gone with the scalpel and I'd say it's a pretty good guess that he's using it not only to operate but also to kill.
The up side and the down side of the curse.
Exactly.
I think the scalpel acts as a sort of rechargeable battery, in that it...
If it doesn't kill for a certain period of time,
I think it runs down, loses its ability to-to heal.
Slowly at first, and then...
Ryan.
Yeah, you're right.
I did see dr.
Howlett a few minutes ago, but, I really couldn't tell you where he went.
Well, thank you.
Which way now?
Not that way, obviously.
Could be anywhere.
Ryan!
Micki?
!
I'm in here!
Ryan?
Micki!
Oh!
Where's Howlett?
Jack!
Jack!
Jack'd say "where's the fire"?
Uh, hello.
I'm dr.
Price, chief of surgery.
We're trying to get Mr. Marshak stabilized.
Does he have any family?
No.
Uh, we're his family.
Well, um...
May need one of you to sign the release for surgery.
Surgery?
Is it that serious?
Yes, I'm afraid it's very serious.
You just hold on here.
I can't believe it.
Not Jack...
That bastard Howlett.
Wait a minute, I'll be right back.
Ryan, where are you going?
I gotta do something.
We need you to operate tonight.
I'm not available.
I thought you'd jump at the chance to do this one.
Why?
Who is it?
It's no one important.
Just one of those patients that you profess to care so much about, who has no chance of living unless you perform a miracle.
I can't operate tonight.
You're here to turn the reputation of this hospital around, Vince, and this surgery is precisely what will put
Ravenbrook back on the map.
There'll be other cases.
Yes, there will be, but I'm afraid the press has got hold of this one.
They're already here, expecting to see the miracle man in action.
I know you won't disappoint them.
What time?
8:30.
All right...
I'll do it.
Strap's too tight.
I'm losing circulation in my arms.
Won't you be a dear and loosen it a tad, will ya?
I promise I won't tell.
Mr. Marshak has an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
What?
What is that?
Well, it's a weakness in the artery leading from the heart.
Uh, probably due to the severity of his fall.
It's like a bubble waiting to explode.
It's almost always fatal.
Well, what can you do?
Operate as soon as possible.
Fortunately, we now have the best surgeon in the country on call.
He's agreed to do the surgery tonight, with your consent.
Now, you may have heard of him.
He's something of a miracle worker.
Howlett?
Hey, skippy, let's go to Heidi's house.
Her parents are gone for the night.
Right on.
Let's go.
Psych emerg, Firestone speaking.
I'm sorry, dr.
Masden is here.
He's been waiting for 20 minutes and the ambulance hasn't arrived.
Well, I've called down to emergency and they don't know anything about it either.
What do you want me to do about it?
All right, I'll give him a call, but this is the second time this has happened this week.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what to do about it.
Well, you can talk to my superior.
Fine.
Fine!
Thank you.
Bye.
Dr. Howlett, call the hospital, please.
Dr...
You're late, dr.
Howlett.
This is not a tennis match.
The results are in:
EKG, CT scan, flat plate.
You might want to look at them.
My scalpel, where is it?
!
I got it.
How's Jack?
Hmm?
Ryan, you've gotta give it back.
What are you talking about?
There's only one surgeon who can save him now.
Where is it?
Get hold of yourself, Vincent!
It's gotta be here.
You have got a patient in there!
He hasn't got time for your emotional problems!
Excuse me, dr.
Howlett?
I think this is yours.
There they are, doctor, your admiring public.
We're ready, doctor.
Let's get on with it.
No opening remarks tonight?
No.
Scalpel.
Anything wrong, doctor?
No, nothing's wrong.
Don't worry about me, doctor.
I'm not gonna lose one.
Not now...
Not ever.
You never know how much somebody means to you until you just might...
Me and my folks, we never got along.
Always treated me like I had a screw loose.
They never let me do anything important, but Jack, he was the first one to act like I had something on the ball.
Give me normal saline through the CDP.
So is it good or bad if an operation takes a long time?
Ryan, I've been thinking.
No matter what happens to Jack, we can't let Howlett get away.
I mean, if there were to be any more killings, it would be our fault, and that would be the last thing Jack would want.
Hi.
Would you like some coffee?
Thanks.
Thanks.
d
We've done everything we can for him.
Doctor.
Powell, I don't want anyone else dealing with this patient's post-op.
I'll supervise his medication personally.
We don't want any surprises.
Doctor, I can take that.
No.
I'll take care of it myself.
Mr. Marshak is in post op until the anesthetic wears off.
You can see him then.
Oh-ho.
Thank god.
Uh, where's Howlett?
Dr. Howlett?
Why?
Uh, we just want to thank him for all the help he's been.
Oh, well, um, I left him in scrub.
He probably wants to have a look at his patient before he leaves.
He wanted to supervise the post-op personally.
Howlett.
You turn around and face me.
I take it you don't want my autograph.
You killed my daughter.
Now it's your turn.
Come closer.
You don't want to miss now.
Yes.
That's right.
Jack!
Don't mind me, get Howlett!
He couldn't have gone far.
Shh!
Keep your ears open.
Look out!
Ryan, look!
We're trapped.
Did you really think you could stop me?
Don't you know who I am?
He with the power to give life and take it away.
Come on!
Let's get out of here.
Run, Micki, run!
Oh.
We need a weapon.
Tell me about it.
It's better than nothing.
Hide behind there.
Micki, hide behind this.
Howlett!
You forget, there's two of us!
Forget?
No.
How can I forget you?
I'm just saving the best for last.
It's good to have you back.
We missed you.
Thank you, my dear Micki.
No more hospitals for me, or that scalpel, I hope.
By the way, you did put it away, hmm?
Yes, Jack.
We put it in the vault.
It's safe and sound.
Mmm.
How did it go?
Jean's on a plane back home.
She should be there in a couple of hours.
How is she?
Oh,
She's okay.
She got what she came for.
I think it's high time that I went back to work.
No, you hold on now.
You want to go anywhere, you let me know.
I'll wheel you there.
This is perfectly ridiculous, Ryan.
I'm capable of going under my own steam.
You heard what the doctor said.
Do you think
I'm ever gonna want to hear what a doctor says again?
Well, now, Howlett did a good job...
What?
Are you kidding?
I mean, the best part of all is with him out of the way, he won't be sending you a bill.

I WAS ON A CASE.
CASE?
THE JOHNSON CASE.
THERE WAS A NEW DEVELOPMENT.
THE PHONE RANG IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
YOU WERE ASLEEP.
IT WAS JUST THIS CASE.
I HAD TO GO.
I KNOW I SHOULD HAVE LEFT A NOTE,
BUT IT WAS, UM, SORT OF UNEXPECTED.
DID YOU, UH...
GO ON THIS CASE BY YOURSELF?
BY MYSELF?
NO.
I WOULDN'T GO OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT BY MYSELF.
NO.
THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE, UH...
OTHER THAN ME.
OK...
HEY, UH...
FEEL LIKE SOME BREAKFAST?
BREAKFAST?
YOU MEAN BREAKFAST?
YEAH.
I WAS JUST SHOWING OFF.
I JUST WANTED TO SHOW YOU I MAKE A MEAN BOWL OF CORN FLAKES.
I'D HAVE WAITED, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
WHEN YOU WERE COMING BACK.
SO...
HUNGRY?
HUNGRY?
YOU DID THIS?
I DID THIS.
COME ON.
WHERE?
TO BED.
SAM, I DON'T THINK--
NO, NOT US.
YOU.
YOU NEED TO SLEEP.
I DON'T NEED TO SLEEP, WE HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.
WE'LL TALK LATER, OK?
COME ON.
[TELEPHONE RINGS]
[RING]
[RING]
[RING]
HELLO.
SAM, WAIT.
HI, MOM.
NO, NO, I WASN'T ACTUALLY DOING ANYTHING.
I WORKED ALL NIGHT,
AND I WAS ABOUT TO GET SOME SLEEP.
NO, THERE'S NOTHING TO REPORT.
NOTHING SPECIAL GOING ON.
JUST THE USUAL ROUTINE.
UH-HUH.
NO, I-I'LL CALL YOU LATER.
I LOVE YOU, TOO, MOM.
BYE.
SAM...
I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT,
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID LAST NIGHT.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK I TOOK IT...
CASUALLY.
GET SOME SLEEP.
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT WHEN YOU WAKE UP.
GETTING TO BE A FAMILIAR SIGHT--
YOU FLAT ON YOUR BACK.
GUESS YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME KNOCK, HUH?
YOUR KEYS FROM THE OTHER NIGHT.
I THINK IT'S TIME YOU AND ME TALKED.
THE WAY I SEE IT...
THE SITUATION IS...
WE HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON.
SOMEONE IN COMMON.
YOU FOLLOWING ME SO FAR?
KIND OF A SHAME IT HAD TO COME DOWN TO THIS.
YOU SEE,
I LIKE YOU, DAVID.
I MEAN, YOU'RE HARD NOT TO LIKE.
BUT THE FACT REMAINS, WE GOT A PROBLEM.
SEE...
SHE'S REAL CONFUSED.
WHICH IS KIND OF FUNNY 'CAUSE, UH...
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING TO BE CONFUSED ABOUT.
I MEAN...
LOOK AT YOU.
YOU'RE A MESS.
LOOK AT THE WAY YOU LIVE-- LOOK AT THIS PLACE.
HEY, DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I MEAN, IT'S KIND OF ENDEARING,
AND I KNOW THAT YOU LIKE IT,
BUT...
I HAPPEN TO THINK THAT MADDIE DESERVES BETTER.
YOU DO, HUH?
YEP.
YEAH, I SURE DO.
SEE, I'VE KNOWN HER FOR A LONG TIME.
I KNOW WHAT SHE NEEDS.
I KNOW WHAT SHE WANTS.
YOU'RE NOT EVEN CLOSE.
IT'S LIKE I SAID,
SHE'S REAL CONFUSED.
IT'S KIND OF UNFORTUNATE.
LAST NIGHT,
I MADE HER A PROPOSITION--
A REAL SERIOUS PROPOSITION.
ONE THAT I THINK,
UNDER ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES,
SHE WOULD HAVE JUMPED AT.
SEE, WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY...
IS IF YOU DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT HER,
YOU SHOULD TELL HER.
AND IF YOU DO CARE ABOUT HER, WELL...
SHE SHOULD KNOW THAT, TOO.
IT'S JUST THAT IT'S REAL OBVIOUS
WHO AND WHAT'S BEST FOR HER.
IT'S REAL SIMPLE, DAVID.
WHY DON'T YOU DO EVERYBODY A FAVOR
AND JUST BACK OFF.
GOOD MORNING, MISS DIPESTO.
GOOD MORNING, MISS HAYES.
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?
MADDIE...
HEY, COME HERE!
HE ASKED YOU, DIDN'T HE?
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT!
HE DID, DIDN'T HE?
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
YOU SEE, I MEAN,
I FIND THIS REALLY INTERESTING, THAT'S ALL.
ACCORDING TO HIM, HE ASKED YOU LAST NIGHT.
NOCHE LAST-AY.
BEFORE YOU CAME TO MY PLACE.
BEFORE WE RAN ALL OVER TOWN.
HITHER AND YON, YON AND HITHER.
WELL, I DON'T RECALL
YOU MENTIONING THAT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I DIDN'T MENTION IT.
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY I DIDN'T MENTION IT?
I DIDN'T MENTION IT BECAUSE IT'S NONE OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS.
NONE OF MY DAMN BUSINESS?
NONE OF MY DAMN BUSINESS?
NONE OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS!
WELL...
ALL RIGHT.
MAYBE IT IS NONE OF MY DAMN BUSINESS,
BUT I GOT A RIGHT TO KNOW.
RIGHT TO KNOW?
WHAT RIGHT TO KNOW?
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY RIGHT TO KNOW!
OH, NO?
NO.
HE ASKED YOU, DIDN'T HE?
HE SAID IT, RIGHT?
STOP IT.
NO, LOOK, HE SAID IT.
DIDN'T HE?
GET OUT OF HERE!
I WANT TO BE ALONE!
SO, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
I WANT TO BE ALONE!
YOU SAID THAT?
I'M SAYING THAT.
ARE YOU SAYING YOU SAID THAT,
OR THAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT?
I WANT TO DIE.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHO'D YOU SAY THAT TO?
YOU'RE BACK!
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE SCUM!
I JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS.
WHY?
WHY?
WHY?
MADDIE, I--
DAVID, I ASKED YOU A QUESTION.
WHY SHOULD I TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT?
WHAT DIFFERENCE WILL IT MAKE?
IT'LL MAKE A LOT OF DIFFERENCE.
IT WON'T.
IT WON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'RE SAYING THIS.
THE TWO OF YOU ACT LIKE YOU'RE COMPETING FOR ME.
MISS DIPESTO COMES IN HERE AND MAKES SPEECHES
ABOUT HOW YOU'RE FALLING APART.
YOU WALK AROUND LIKE THE JILTED LOVER,
LIKE THE WORLD IS COMING TO AN END.
WELL, YOU'RE NOT THE JILTED ANYTHING, DAVID.
YOU WON'T EVEN PUT YOURSELF IN THE GAME.
IT'S NOT FAIR.
YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU EVERYTHING,
BUT YOU TELL ME NOTHING.
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.
AM I SUPPOSED TO THINK BECAUSE YOU CHASED ME DOWN THE HALL
THAT YOU CARE ABOUT ME?
THAT YOU DON'T WANT ME TO MARRY SAM?
HOW ABOUT WE DO IT ALL AGAIN?
ONLY THIS TIME, I'LL CHASE YOU.
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT ME, DAVID?
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT ALL THIS, DAVID?
I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW, DON'T I?
DON'T I?
YES, HE ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM.
NO, I HAVEN'T SAID YES YET.
BUT YES, I'M THINKING ABOUT IT.
HE'S WILLING TO MAKE A COMMITMENT TO ME.
HOW ABOUT YOU?
IF YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING,
NOW'S THE TIME TO SAY IT.
IF YOU WANT TO TALK, TALK.
COME ON, DAVID.
SPEAK NOW OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR PEACE.
RIGHT.
ARE WE THROUGH?
SURE SOUNDS LIKE IT.
SURE DOES.

AND VOILA.
SHE GOES HOME WITH THE LOVELY PARTING GIFTS,
AND HE GETS THE ROOM AT THE Y.
HA!
MARRIAGE...
SO, JUST IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, OR WHAT?
SAM'S HERE.
WELL, I GUESS HE'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE.
MAYBE SATURN'S CLOSED.
THEY'RE GOING TO DINNER.
OK.
UH, WELL, SIR, I...
IT'S JUST THAT...
WE JUST THOUGHT...
WE JUST THOUGHT...
WE THOUGHT
THAT THERE
MIGHT BE SOMETHING
YOU MIGHT WANT TO SAY...
TO MISS HAYES...
WHILE SHE STILL IS MISS HAYES.
YOUR HONOR, I OBJECT.
THAT ANSWER IS NOT RESPONSIVE.
I'LL STRIKE IT.
DIDN'T SHE CATCH YOU
FONDLING HER HUSBAND'S NAKED BODY?
[ENGINE STARTS]
HEY!
HEY!
MADDIE...
DAVID, COME ON.
TIME-OUT.
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?
THIS HAS GOT NOTHIN' TO DO WITH YOU.
GET OUT OF THE CAR.
GET YOUR HAND OFF THE CAR, PLEASE.
MADDIE, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
HEY, DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME?
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
YEAH, BUT SEE, SHE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
BUTT OUT, BUCK ROGERS!
LOOK, I JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
PLEASE?
GO AWAY, DAVID.
[HORNS HONK]
MADDIE?
I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS.
I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS.
MADDIE, COME HERE.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
HEY!
OH, GOD!
OH, GOD!
OH, GOD!
OH, GOD!
LEAVE ME ALONE, BOTH OF YOU!
DAVID...
WHY DON'T WE JUST STOP?
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME, PAL!
HOW ABOUT ME AND YOU TAKE A WALK
AROUND THE BLOCK, HUH?
YOU'RE AN ASS, YOU KNOW THAT?
I JUST WANTED TO TALK TO HER.
[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]
I WANT THE TWO OF YOU--
OH, MY GOD.
DAVID.
THAT'S ME.
YOU MISSED IT, MADDIE.
THE FIGHT OF THE CENTURY.
THE BARRAGE IN THE GARAGE.
TKO...
S.O.S...
S.O.B...
THAT'S ME.
I'M FINE.
I'M FINE.
CAME DOWN HERE 'CAUSE I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU, TOO.
I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW BUSY YOU WERE.
BUT NOW, OF COURSE,
I REALIZE HOW BUSY YOU ARE.
I'M FINE.
I'M GREAT, REALLY.
JUST WALKING ALONG...
SINGING A SONG.
* I'M SINGIN' IN THE RAIN *
* I'M SINGIN' IN THE RAIN *
* WHAT A GLORIOUS FEELIN' *
* I'M HAP-HAPPY AGAIN **
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH...
I DIDN'T TAKE THE FIRST SWING.
OK.
SAM, DOES IT REALLY MATTER?
YEAH.
YEAH, IT MATTERS TO ME.
JUST TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT,
I DIDN'T START ANY OF THAT.
I DIDN'T SAY YOU DID.
NO.
NO, YOU DIDN'T.
YOU HAVEN'T SAID A THING.
YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF FUNNY, MADDIE.
I COME TO PICK YOU UP FOR DINNER.
YOUR PARTNER, HE THROWS A ROADBLOCK, ON THE WAY OUT,
GRABS YOU OUT OF THE CAR,
TRIES TO SEPARATE MY HEAD FROM MY SHOULDERS.
SOMEHOW, I CAN'T SHAKE THE FEELING
THAT SOMEHOW I'M BEING CAST AS THE BAD GUY.
NOBODY'S CALLING YOU THE BAD GUY.
NOBODY'S CALLING YOU ANYTHING.
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS KINDA FUNNY?
THE LAST TIME I CHECKED MY WATCH,
IT WAS 36 HOURS SINCE I ASKED YOU WHAT I ASKED YOU,
AND I HAVEN'T HEARD THE SLIGHTEST RESPONSE,
WHICH WOULDN'T BE TOO BAD
IF THE WOMAN I HAD ASKED
ON THE VERY SAME NIGHT I ASKED HER,
HADN'T LEFT OUR BED
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
HEY, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT STICKS IN MY CRAW THE MOST.
MM-MMM.
YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT THAT IS?
THAT'S WHEN THE WOMAN I ASKED TO MARRY ME,
THE MORNING AFTER I ASK HER, TELLS HER MOTHER,
WHO I'LL LAY ODDS SHE HASN'T TALKED TO IN QUITE A WHILE,
THAT THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON.
THAT IT'S JUST THE, UH...
"SAME OLD ROUTINE."
I DON'T KNOW...
IT'S REALLY KIND OF FUNNY, MADDIE.
I'M NOT SAYING YOU DON'T WANT TO BE MARRIED.
I'M JUST SAYING MAYBE IT'S NOT TO ME.
WELL...
I DON'T THINK I FEEL MUCH LIKE HAVING DINNER.
FINE.
LET'S GO HOME.
YEAH, RIGHT.
MY HOME.
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
NOTHING.
IT MEANS NOTHING.
IT MEANS SOMETHING.
IT MEANS...
I NEED TIME!
I NEED SPACE.
I'M NOT GLIB.
IF YOU WANT GLIB, MARRY DAVID.
I'VE GOT TO THINK THIS THROUGH!
THAT'S WHO I AM.
THAT'S WHAT I AM.
AND WHILE WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT--
WILL YOU STOP YELLING?
WHO TOLD DAVID ADDISON
ABOUT YOUR PROPOSAL?
ME!
ME.
YOU?
I DID.
YES.
THANK YOU.
YOU GOT A PROBLEM?
YEAH, I GOT A PROBLEM.
IT'S NONE OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS.
NONE OF MY DAMN--
IT'S NONE OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS!
IT'S MY BUSINESS TO TELL HIM.
IT'S MY BUSINESS TO EVEN CHOOSE TO TELL HIM!
MINE!
MY BUSINESS, MY CHOICE!
MY GOD, THIS ISN'T SOMETHING YOU SETTLE
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU!
THIS IS SOMETHING I SETTLE BETWEEN THE TWO OF US!
THE ONE OF ME.
DON'T I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT ALL THIS?
YOU AND I MAY HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER 20 YEARS LONGER
THAN ME AND DAVID, WHO ISN'T THE ISSUE HERE.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN WALTZ IN HERE,
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, AND STAKE YOUR CLAIM
LIKE I WAS A PIECE OF REAL ESTATE.
I DIDN'T THINK THAT'S WHAT I DID.
WELL, THAT SURE FEELS LIKE WHAT YOU DID.
I GUESS MAYBE...
I'M JUST NOT USED TO ASKING SOMEONE TO MARRY ME.
AHH, I KNOW.
I'M NOT USED TO BEING ASKED.
HOME.
SORRY ABOUT DINNER.
IT'S OK.
I'LL TAKE A RAIN CHECK.
SAM, I THINK MAYBE I'D LIKE
TO BE BY MYSELF FOR A WHILE.
ME, TOO.
YEAH, RIGHT-- NO, REALLY.
IT'S EASIER IF I GO.
NO, IT'S EASIER IF I GO.
YOU STAY HERE.
NO, YOU STAY HERE.
THIS IS YOUR HOME.
YOU HAVE NO PLACE TO GO.
I'LL GO TO SOMEBODY ELSE'S HOME.
I'LL GO TO A HOTEL.
PLEASE.
IT'S OK.
I'LL TAKE THE CAR, AND YOU TAKE THE HOUSE.
WORK OUT THE ALIMONY LATER?
I'M SORRY.
SEE YOU LATER?
YEAH...
SEE YOU LATER.
DAVID...
[DOOR CLOSES]
[KNOCKS ON DOOR]
MISS HAYES.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO DINNER.
YEAH, I KNOW.
I DIDN'T FEEL MUCH LIKE DINNER.
I DIDN'T FEEL MUCH LIKE ANYTHING.
MR. ADDISON'S FAVORITE.
HE MUST'VE BEEN PRETTY UPSET.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, MISS DIPESTO?
IT'S LATE.
I DON'T KNOW,
JUST DIDN'T WANT HIM TO COME IN HERE TOMORROW
AND FIND THIS MESS.
HE'S SO--
I KNOW.
YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON, AGNES.
I KNOW THIS IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS, MISS HAYES,
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE MR. ADDISON
ISN'T THE ONLY ONE WHO'S UPSET AROUND HERE.
I'M FINE.
IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO...
NO.
I DON'T THINK SO.
WANT TO GET WRECKED?
EXCUSE ME?
YOU KNOW, BOMBED?
PICKLED?
POLLUTED?
ALL THE BOY DETECTIVES DO IT.
IT'S BETTER AT THE END OF THE BAR.
PEOPLE DON'T TRY TO PICK YOU UP,
AND IT'S EASIER TO GET
THE BARTENDER'S ATTENTION.
WHAT'LL IT BE, LADIES?
WHITE WINE, PLEASE.
WINE GIVES ME A HEADACHE.
I THINK I'LL HAVE...
A DOUBLE KAMIKAZE.
SO...
SO?
I DON'T KNOW.
OH...
NOT ONLY DO I NOT KNOW,
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I DON'T KNOW,
YOU KNOW?
I THINK SO.
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I HAVE A BIG PROBLEM
AND I NEED SOMEONE TO TALK TO,
I TALK TO MR. ADDISON.
I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO.
GOOD.
BUT HE USUALLY HAS GOOD ADVICE,
AND HE SAYS ONE OF THOSE CUTE LITTLE THINGS
THAT ONLY MR. ADDISON CAN SAY--
MISS DIPESTO...
OR TELLS ME ONE OF THOSE CUTE LITTLE STORIES
THAT ONLY MR. ADDISON CAN TELL.
MISS DIPESTO--
AND THEN SUDDENLY, I FEEL ALL CHEERED UP,
LIKE MAGIC,
LIKE JIFFY POP WITHOUT THE GREASE.
MISS DIPESTO, THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM
I CARE TO DISCUSS WITH MR. ADDISON.
OH.
HEY.
PEOPLE ARE THIRSTY DOWN HERE.
MAYBE THIS IS NOT SOMETHING
YOU CAN DISCUSS WITH ANYONE.
'CAUSE NO ONE ELSE KNOWS WHAT'S IN YOUR HEART.
LIKE MR. ADDISON SAYS,
"YOU CAN LEAD A HORSE TO WATER,
BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE HIM A DUCK."
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
[LAUGHING] I-I DON'T KNOW.
IT JUST ALWAYS SOUNDS SO CUTE
WHEN MR. ADDISON SAYS IT.
I DON'T CARE WHAT MR. ADDISON SAYS.
THIS IS NOT ABOUT MR. ADDISON.
IT ISN'T?
IT ISN'T!
OH.
BARTENDER.
WHAT IS THIS, THE SELF-SERVE AISLE?
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SNAP.
I'M CONFUSED.
IT'S JUST THAT MARRIAGE IS SUCH A HUGE THING
THAT MAYBE YOU NEVER KNOW IF YOU'RE READY.
MAYBE IT ISN'T POSSIBLE TO BE SURE YOU'RE READY.
AHH...
MAYBE IT'S ONLY POSSIBLE TO BE SURE YOU'RE NOT READY.
SAM WAS RIGHT.
I OWE HIM AN ANSWER.
I OWE HIM AN ANSWER,
AND I'M GOING HOME TO GIVE HIM AN ANSWER.
THIS IS THE HARDEST THING I'VE EVER HAD TO DO.
MISS DIPESTO?
SAM.
DON'T.
DON'T MOVE, DON'T SPEAK,
DON'T EVEN LOOK AT ME.
THIS IS SO HARD.
YOU'RE SO WONDERFUL.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK FOR A MINUTE
THAT I DIDN'T TAKE YOUR PROPOSAL SERIOUSLY.
IT'S THE MOST WONDERFUL,
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ANYONE'S EVER ASKED ME.
THE THOUGHT OF MARRYING YOU,
OF HAVING A FAMILY WITH YOU...
I MAY HATE MYSELF FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.
BUT THE CRUEL TRICK IN ALL THIS IS
IF YOU'D ASKED ME 5 OR 10 YEARS AGO,
THE ANSWER WOULD'VE BEEN DIFFERENT...
BUT RIGHT NOW...
I'M SORRY.
I KNOW YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHY,
BUT YOU'RE WRONG.
I CARE ABOUT YOU SO MUCH.
I SPEND EVERY WAKING MINUTE
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN MAKE IT WORK,
BUT I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN.
NOT RIGHT NOW, NOT WITH...
SAM, YOU DESERVE SOMEONE WHO LOVES YOU,
ONLY YOU,
AND I DO LOVE YOU,
BUT NOT ONLY YOU.
I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT THIS IS FOR YOU TO HEAR.
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR ME TO SAY.
I LOVE YOU, SAM.
YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT,
BUT...
I LOVE HIM, TOO...
AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU.
I KNOW IT MEANS YOU'LL WANT TO LEAVE
AND MAYBE NEVER SEE ME AGAIN...
BUT DO ME A FAVOR.
DON'T.
AT LEAST NOT RIGHT NOW.
GIVE ME TONIGHT.
GIVE US TONIGHT.
WE'LL HOLD EACH OTHER.
WE'LL MAKE LOVE.
WE'LL SLEEP.
AND IF I WAKE UP AND YOU'RE NOT HERE,
I'LL UNDERSTAND.
JUST HOLD ME, PLEASE.
OH, SAM.
OH, MADDIE.
OOH, I LIKE THAT.
AAH!
AAH!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I WAS GETTING LUCKY.
YOU ARE THE MOST LOATHSOME,
THE MOST DISGUSTING, THE MOST VILE--
COME ON.
HOW YOU GONNA KNOW TILL YOU TRY?
WHERE'S SAM?
WHERE'S SAM?
WHERE'S SAM?
THAT KINDA QUESTION IS DEFINITELY GONNA KILL THE MOOD.
WHERE?
SAM'S GONE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN GONE?
GONE.
AS IN GOING, GOING...
I KNOW WHAT THE WORD MEANS, DAVID.
WHERE DID HE GO?
WHEN WILL HE--
WHEN I GOT HERE, HIS BAGS WERE PACKED.
THAT'S IT?
NO EXPLANATIONS, NO GOOD-BYES,
NO ANYTHING?
YEAH...
I WAS KIND OF SURPRISED, TOO.
I GUESS SPELLING DOESN'T COUNT FOR MUCH IN OUTER SPACE.
BREEZE CAME UP, BLEW IT INTO MY LAP.
LOOK...
I CAME OVER HERE BECAUSE I WANTED TO TALK.
FIGURED I OWED HIM AN APOLOGY
AND THAT I OWED YOU AN APOLOGY.
AND WHEN I GOT HERE,
HE WAS ON HIS WAY OUT THE DOOR.
HE SAID, HE DIDN'T SEE
HOW YOU AND HIM COULD MAKE IT WORK,
THAT HE THOUGHT THAT YOU HAD...
SOME OTHER THINGS
THAT YOU NEEDED TO TAKE CARE OF.
I FIGURED I'D STICK AROUND.
I'VE BEEN, EH...
TAKING THESE PAIN PILLS.
YOUR BOY SAMMY GAVE ME A PRETTY GOOD SHOT IN THE WING HERE.
SO I CAME UP HERE AND LAID DOWN,
AND THE REST, AS THEY SAY,
IS KISMET.
GO HOME, DAVID.
YOU SURE YOU REALLY WANT ME TO DO THAT?
WHAT?
MADDIE, SAM'S GONE...
AND WE'RE HERE.
SO?
SO...
SO WHAT, DAVID?
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
WHAT I'M SAYING IS...
WE...
ARE HERE.
THE TWO OF US.
TOGETHER.
ISN'T THAT WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT?
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.
THIS IS ABOUT ME.
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT WHAT I WANT.
I WAS THE ONE PROPOSED TO.
I WAS THE ONE WHO HAD A CHOICE TO MAKE,
NOT A CHOICE BETWEEN TWO MEN,
BUT A CHOICE FOR MY FUTURE, MY LIFE,
BUT I'M NOT GONNA GET A CHANCE
TO MAKE THAT CHOICE
BECAUSE AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE, AND WHO KNOWS HOW MANY OTHERS,
HAVE BEEN CONSPIRING TO MAKE IT FOR ME.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
YOU INTERRUPT OUR DINNER.
HE GOES TO YOUR APARTMENT TO DISCUSS THE PROPOSAL.
THE TWO OF YOU PLAY POPEYE AND BLUTO IN THE GARAGE.
THEN HE LEAVES, AND YOU'RE HERE.
I DON'T KNOW WHY I BOTHER SHOWING UP.
EVERYTHING SEEMS TO GET DONE
PERFECTLY WELL WITHOUT ME.
THE TWO OF YOU DID JUST FINE BY YOURSELVES.
WHAT ABOUT JUST NOW?
WHAT ABOUT JUST NOW?
I THOUGHT THAT WAS HIM, I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS YOU.
MADDIE, YOU SAID SOME THINGS THAT--
AND YOU DIDN'T.
NOTHING.
NOT DURING THE WHOLE THING, DAVID.
YOU HAVEN'T SAID A WORD.
I DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING?
STOP SMILING.
WHY ARE YOU SMILING?
HOW CAN YOU BE SO SMUG?
I'M NOT BEING SMUG.
I'M BEING HONEST.
I DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.
YOU KNOW IT, AND I KNOW IT.
YOU FEEL IT, AND I FEEL IT.
STAY AWAY FROM ME.
HERE I COME.
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU.
I NEVER WANTED YOU.
YEAH, RIGHT.
I HEARD THE SPEECH ABOUT THE GOOD-BYE GROPE.
BUT THAT WAS FOR HIM, NOT FOR YOU.
WAKE UP.
I'M NOT LEAVING HIM FOR YOU,
I'M LEAVING HIM FOR ME.
ME.
ME, ME, ME.
IS THAT CLEAR?
WHY DON'T YOU TRY IT IN C-FLAT.
GET BACK.
PUT THAT DOWN, MADDIE.
NO.
PUT IT DOWN.
NO.
I'M NOT GOING TO FORCE MYSELF ON YOU.
I DON'T WANT TO FORCE MYSELF ON YOU.
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, YOU'RE NOT WORTH IT.
WHAT?
YOU HEARD ME.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, NOT WORTH IT?
NOT WORTH IT!
NOT WORTH IT!
NO WOMAN IS WORTH THIS, ALL RIGHT?
LOOK, NEVER MIND.
ALL RIGHT?
JUST FORGET ABOUT IT.
THIS WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE.
I'M NOT WORTH IT?
I'M NOT WORTH IT?
LOOK WHO'S TALKING ABOUT WORTH!
MR. BARGAIN BASEMENT.
IF THERE WAS A CLOSE-OUT SALE ON HUMAN BEINGS,
YOU'D BE THE LAST ONE TO SELL.
YEAH, YOU OUGHT TO KNOW, HONEY.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT MEANS.
IT MEANS, YOU'RE THE KIND OF PERSON THAT GOES THROUGH LIFE
LOOKING AT THE PRICE TAGS INSTEAD OF THE MERCHANDISE.
YOU WANT SOME GUY WENT TO A GREAT SCHOOL,
GREAT MUG, NICE MANNERS.
WELL, THAT'S FINE.
JUST FINE.
MAKES SENSE.
LOOK AT YOU.
YOU'RE NOT A PERSON, YOU'RE A POSTER.
YOU DESERVE ANOTHER POSTER.
YOU'RE GOING OVER THE LINE, DAVID.
YOU SPEND MORE TIME DRESSING THAN YOU DO SMILING!
YOU SPEND MORE TIME WITH BUSINESS THAN YOU DO WITH PLEASURE.
AND YOUR WAY'S BETTER?
MORE TIME SINGING THAN WORKING?
MORE TIME SCREWING UP THAN MOVING UP?
MOVING UP?
IS THAT WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN?
SPARE ME.
IS THAT WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN, HUH?
WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE IN?
A GOOD PARTY.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I DON'T BELIEVE IN,
I DON'T BELIEVE IN WASTING ANYMORE TIME.
I'M SICK OF THIS.
TWO YEARS OF "IS YOU IS, OR IS YOU AIN'T?"
TWO YEARS OF BEES BEEING AND DUCKS DUCKING.
AND A MAN WHO THINKS THAT CULTURE IS DARK BEER.
I--THIS IS RIDICULOUS!
I'M MISERABLE!
SO AM I.
YEAH, WELL...
I MAY HAVE JUST LET THE BEST THING
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME GET AWAY,
AND LOOK AT ME, HERE I AM,
SPENDING THE EVENING
HAVING ANOTHER POINTLESS ARGUMENT WITH YOU!
FINE.
FINE.
GOOD.
GOOD.
BITCH.
BASTARD.
GET OUT.
GET OUT!

DAVID, FINALLY PREPARED
TO CONFESS HIS LOVE TO MADDIE,
RUSHES TO HER DOOR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
MADDIE, I GOT SOMETHING TO TELL YOU!
NOW LISTEN, I KNOW IT'S 4:00 IN THE MORNING.
CAN I HELP YOU?
HI.
HI.
KNOWING WHAT HE MUST DO,
DAVID INTERRUPTS A DINNER DATE BETWEEN MADDIE
AND HER NEW BOYFRIEND SAM.
DAVID?
EVENING.
HI.
HI.
DAVID?
FORGIVE ME.
I'M, UH, SORRY.
SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOUR DINNER.
IT'S JUST THAT THERE'S KIND OF AN EMERGENCY.
TOO HAMMERED TO DRIVE HOME ALONE,
DAVID FINDS HIMSELF ESCORTED THERE
BY NONE OTHER THAN SAM.
* ALL THOSE IN-BETWEEN YEARS *
* COME WHAT MAY *
* WHO KNOWS WHERE THE ROAD WILL LEAD US *
* ONLY A FOOL... **
MEANWHILE...
OH, HELL.
YOU CAN READ THE CARD.
COME ON, MADDIE,
WHAT DO YOU SAY, WE MAKE IT OFFICIAL?
YOU AND ME.
WIFE AND WIFE.
SAM...
WHERE DID THIS COME FROM?
I DON'T KNOW.
I'VE BEEN LAYING HERE WAITING FOR YOU...
DOING THINGS.
LISTENING FOR THE SOUND OF A CAR.
HMM, 2:30 IN THE MORNING, RIGHT?
ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU CRAZY.
IT DIDN'T MAKE ME CRAZY.
IT MADE ME KIND OF HAPPY.
YEAH...
YEAH, PERFECTLY HAPPY.
JUST SITTING HERE...
KNOWING THAT YOU'D BE COMING HOME...
SOMETIME...
TO ME.
YOU JUST LEFT HIM THERE, HUH?
HE'S PERFECT FOR ME, YOU KNOW?

I THINK YOU LOOK GREAT.
I FEEL GREAT.
YOU WANNA KNOW SOMETHIN' DUMB?
I HAD A GREAT TIME.
YEAH.
ME, TOO.
MUST BE THE LACK OF SLEEP.

WELCOME HOME.
YOU SCARED ME.
DIDN'T MEAN TO.
AHH...
MORNING.
YEAH...
IT SURE IS.
YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING...
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.
I WAS ON A CASE.
CASE?
THE JOHNSON CASE.
THERE WAS A NEW DEVELOPMENT.
THE PHONE RANG IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
YOU WERE ASLEEP.
IT WAS JUST THIS CASE.
I HAD TO GO.
I KNOW I SHOULD HAVE LEFT A NOTE,
BUT IT WAS, UM, SORT OF UNEXPECTED.
DID YOU, UH...
GO ON THIS CASE BY YOURSELF?
BY MYSELF?
NO.
I WOULDN'T GO OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT BY MYSELF.
NO.
THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE, UH...
OTHER THAN ME.
OK...
HEY, UH...
FEEL LIKE SOME BREAKFAST?
BREAKFAST?
YOU MEAN BREAKFAST?
YEAH.
I WAS JUST SHOWING OFF.
I JUST WANTED TO SHOW YOU I MAKE A MEAN BOWL OF CORN FLAKES.
I'D HAVE WAITED, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
WHEN YOU WERE COMING BACK.
SO...
HUNGRY?
HUNGRY?
YOU DID THIS?
I DID THIS.
COME ON.
WHERE?
TO BED.
SAM, I DON'T THINK-
NO, NOT US.
YOU.
YOU NEED TO SLEEP.
I DON'T NEED TO SLEEP, WE HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.
WE'LL TALK LATER, OK?
COME ON.
HELLO.
SAM, WAIT.
HI, MOM.
NO, NO, I WASN'T ACTUALLY DOING ANYTHING.
I WORKED ALL NIGHT,
AND I WAS ABOUT TO GET SOME SLEEP.
NO, THERE'S NOTHING TO REPORT.
NOTHING SPECIAL GOING ON.
JUST THE USUAL ROUTINE.
UH-HUH.
NO, I-I'LL CALL YOU LATER.
I LOVE YOU, TOO, MOM.
BYE.
SAM...
I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT,
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID LAST NIGHT.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK I TOOK IT...
CASUALLY.
GET SOME SLEEP.
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT WHEN YOU WAKE UP.
GETTING TO BE A FAMILIAR SIGHT-
YOU FLAT ON YOUR BACK.
GUESS YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME KNOCK, HUH?
YOUR KEYS FROM THE OTHER NIGHT.
I THINK IT'S TIME YOU AND ME TALKED.
THE WAY I SEE IT...
THE SITUATION IS...
WE HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON.
SOMEONE IN COMMON.
YOU FOLLOWING ME SO FAR?
KIND OF A SHAME IT HAD TO COME DOWN TO THIS.
YOU SEE,
I LIKE YOU, DAVID.
I MEAN, YOU'RE HARD NOT TO LIKE.
BUT THE FACT REMAINS, WE GOT A PROBLEM.
SEE...
SHE'S REAL CONFUSED.
WHICH IS KIND OF FUNNY 'CAUSE, UH...
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING TO BE CONFUSED ABOUT.
I MEAN...
LOOK AT YOU.
YOU'RE A MESS.
LOOK AT THE WAY YOU LIVE- LOOK AT THIS PLACE.
HEY, DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I MEAN, IT'S KIND OF ENDEARING,
AND I KNOW THAT YOU LIKE IT,
BUT...
I HAPPEN TO THINK THAT MADDIE DESERVES BETTER.
YOU DO, HUH?
YEP.
YEAH, I SURE DO.
SEE, I'VE KNOWN HER FOR A LONG TIME.
I KNOW WHAT SHE NEEDS.
I KNOW WHAT SHE WANTS.
YOU'RE NOT EVEN CLOSE.
IT'S LIKE I SAID,
SHE'S REAL CONFUSED.
IT'S KIND OF UNFORTUNATE.
LAST NIGHT,
I MADE HER A PROPOSITION-
A REAL SERIOUS PROPOSITION.
ONE THAT I THINK,
UNDER ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES,
SHE WOULD HAVE JUMPED AT.
SEE, WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY...
IS IF YOU DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT HER,
YOU SHOULD TELL HER.
AND IF YOU DO CARE ABOUT HER, WELL...
SHE SHOULD KNOW THAT, TOO.
IT'S JUST THAT IT'S REAL OBVIOUS
WHO AND WHAT'S BEST FOR HER.
IT'S REAL SIMPLE, DAVID.
WHY DON'T YOU DO EVERYBODY A FAVOR
AND JUST BACK OFF.
GOOD MORNING, MISS DIPESTO.
GOOD MORNING, MISS HAYES.
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?
MADDIE...
HEY, COME HERE!
HE ASKED YOU, DIDN'T HE?
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT!
HE DID, DIDN'T HE?
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
YOU SEE, I MEAN,
I FIND THIS REALLY INTERESTING, THAT'S ALL.
ACCORDING TO HIM, HE ASKED YOU LAST NIGHT.
NOCHE LAST-AY.
BEFORE YOU CAME TO MY PLACE.
BEFORE WE RAN ALL OVER TOWN.
HITHER AND YON, YON AND HITHER.
WELL, I DON'T RECALL
YOU MENTIONING THAT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I DIDN'T MENTION IT.
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY I DIDN'T MENTION IT?
I DIDN'T MENTION IT BECAUSE IT'S NONE OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS.
NONE OF MY DAMN BUSINESS?
NONE OF MY DAMN BUSINESS?
NONE OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS!
WELL...
ALL RIGHT.
MAYBE IT IS NONE OF MY DAMN BUSINESS,
BUT I GOT A RIGHT TO KNOW.
RIGHT TO KNOW?
WHAT RIGHT TO KNOW?
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY RIGHT TO KNOW!
OH, NO?
NO.
HE ASKED YOU, DIDN'T HE?
HE SAID IT, RIGHT?
STOP IT.
NO, LOOK, HE SAID IT.
DIDN'T HE?
GET OUT OF HERE!
I WANT TO BE ALONE!
SO, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
I WANT TO BE ALONE!
YOU SAID THAT?
I'M SAYING THAT.
ARE YOU SAYING YOU SAID THAT,
OR THAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT?
I WANT TO DIE.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHO'D YOU SAY THAT TO?
YOU'RE BACK!
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE SCUM!
I JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS.
WHY?
WHY?
WHY?
MADDIE, I-
DAVID, I ASKED YOU A QUESTION.
WHY SHOULD I TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT?
WHAT DIFFERENCE WILL IT MAKE?
IT'LL MAKE A LOT OF DIFFERENCE.
IT WON'T.
IT WON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'RE SAYING THIS.
THE TWO OF YOU ACT LIKE YOU'RE COMPETING FOR ME.
MISS DIPESTO COMES IN HERE AND MAKES SPEECHES
ABOUT HOW YOU'RE FALLING APART.
YOU WALK AROUND LIKE THE JILTED LOVER,
LIKE THE WORLD IS COMING TO AN END.
WELL, YOU'RE NOT THE JILTED ANYTHING, DAVID.
YOU WON'T EVEN PUT YOURSELF IN THE GAME.
IT'S NOT FAIR.
YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU EVERYTHING,
BUT YOU TELL ME NOTHING.
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.
AM I SUPPOSED TO THINK BECAUSE YOU CHASED ME DOWN THE HALL
THAT YOU CARE ABOUT ME?
THAT YOU DON'T WANT ME TO MARRY SAM?
HOW ABOUT WE DO IT ALL AGAIN?
ONLY THIS TIME, I'LL CHASE YOU.
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT ME, DAVID?
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT ALL THIS, DAVID?
I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW, DON'T I?
DON'T I?
YES, HE ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM.
NO, I HAVEN'T SAID YES YET.
BUT YES, I'M THINKING ABOUT IT.
HE'S WILLING TO MAKE A COMMITMENT TO ME.
HOW ABOUT YOU?
IF YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING,
NOW'S THE TIME TO SAY IT.
IF YOU WANT TO TALK, TALK.
COME ON, DAVID.
SPEAK NOW OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR PEACE.
RIGHT.
ARE WE THROUGH?
SURE SOUNDS LIKE IT.
SURE DOES.
* DON'T KNOW WHY *
* THERE'S NO SUN UP IN THE SKY *
* STORMY WEATHER *
* SINCE MY MAN AND I *
* AIN'T TOGETHER *
* KEEPS RAINING ALL THE TIME **
LIFE'S FUNNY, ISN'T IT?
I MEAN, THE DELICATE BALANCE...
THE FRAGILITY...
THE PRECARIOUSNESS OF ANY GIVEN MOMENT.
DO YOU HAVE ANY 3s?
TAKE OFFICE RELATIONSHIPS...
JUST TO RANDOMLY PICK SOMETHING
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD.
ONE MINUTE THEY'RE SAFE AND SANE,
ALL BARK AND NO BITE.
THEN SUDDENLY...
THEY CHANGE.
THAT'S TRUE.
TRICKY FIGURING OUT HOW TO HANDLE IT.
MMM.
A LOT OF CONFLICTING EMOTIONS.
LIKE, UH...
WILL YOU MISS THE SEXUAL TENSION?
DAY IN AND DAY OUT RUSH OF ADRENALIN YOU GET FROM...
BEING VERY CLOSE TO SOMEBODY YOU'RE...
WILDLY EXCITED ABOUT, YET...
YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU REALLY SHOULD HAVE.
OR WILL IT BE WONDERFUL
GETTING TO KNOW THAT PERSON
IN A WHOLE NEW WAY?
IS WHAT'S HAPPENING, HYPOTHETICALLY SPEAKING,
IS WHAT'S HAPPENING...
A NATURAL HORMONAL REACTION TO...
SOMEBODY YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH?
OR IS IT THE REAL mccoy?
DO YOU...
RISK...
TELLING THAT PERSON...
HOW YOU LONG FOR HER?
HOW...
HOW ALL YOU CAN THINK ABOUT...
IS PUTTING MATHIS ON THE WALKMAN
AND DANCING WITH HER IN THE EXECUTIVE WASHROOM?
OR DO YOU KEEP YOUR FEELINGS TO YOURSELF
AND JUST LET THAT PERSON
FIND ANOTHER PERSON TO LOVE?
WHEN THE PERSON EACH OF YOU REALLY WANTS
IS RIGHT UNDER YOUR NOSES.
WHEN THE PERSON EACH OF YOU REALLY WANTS
IS RIGHT UNDER YOUR NOSES.
BOY, YOU CAN REALLY SEE THE PROBLEM
MR. ADDISON MUST BE HAVING.
NOT TO MENTION MISS HAYES.
TAKE THE BELTWAY AROUND THIS ONE, BUCKO.
PARDON ME?
THE SCENIC ROUTE IS OUT.
MISS HAYES IS EXPECTING YOU.
THANKS.
MR. ADDISON?
EXCUSE THE MESS.
I GOT A LITTLE FRUSTRATED.
COULDN'T FIND ANY PAPER CLIPS.
THAT-THAT IS FRUSTRATING.
I KNOW HOW THAT CAN BE.
YOU EVER NOTICE HOW MANY BOBS
WE GOT ON DAYTIME TV?
I MEAN, YOU GOT YOUR OCCASIONAL OPRAH,
MAYBE A VANNA HERE AND THERE,
BUT MOSTLY BOBS.
MR. ADDISON...
DID YOU EVER WATCH DIVORCE COURT?
IT'S PRETTY GOOD.
HUSBAND WHINES, WIFE WHINES,
THE LAWYER DOES HIS LITTLE DANCE.
AND VOILA.
SHE GOES HOME WITH THE LOVELY PARTING GIFTS,
AND HE GETS THE ROOM AT THE Y.
HA!
MARRIAGE...
SO, JUST IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, OR WHAT?
SAM'S HERE.
WELL, I GUESS HE'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE.
MAYBE SATURN'S CLOSED.
THEY'RE GOING TO DINNER.
OK.
UH, WELL, SIR, I...
IT'S JUST THAT...
WE JUST THOUGHT...
WE JUST THOUGHT...
WE THOUGHT
THAT THERE
MIGHT BE SOMETHING
YOU MIGHT WANT TO SAY...
TO MISS HAYES...
WHILE SHE STILL IS MISS HAYES.
YOUR HONOR, I OBJECT.
THAT ANSWER IS NOT RESPONSIVE.
I'LL STRIKE IT.
DIDN'T SHE CATCH YOU
FONDLING HER HUSBAND'S NAKED BODY?
HEY!
HEY!
MADDIE...
DAVID, COME ON.
TIME-OUT.
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?
THIS HAS GOT NOTHIN' TO DO WITH YOU.
GET OUT OF THE CAR.
GET YOUR HAND OFF THE CAR, PLEASE.
MADDIE, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
HEY, DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME?
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
YEAH, BUT SEE, SHE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
BUTT OUT, BUCK ROGERS!
LOOK, I JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
PLEASE?
GO AWAY, DAVID.
MADDIE?
I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS.
I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS.
MADDIE, COME HERE.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
HEY!
OH, GOD!
OH, GOD!
OH, GOD!
OH, GOD!
LEAVE ME ALONE, BOTH OF YOU!
DAVID...
WHY DON'T WE JUST STOP?
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME, PAL!
HOW ABOUT ME AND YOU TAKE A WALK
AROUND THE BLOCK, HUH?
YOU'RE AN ASS, YOU KNOW THAT?
I JUST WANTED TO TALK TO HER.
I WANT THE TWO OF YOU-
OH, MY GOD.
DAVID.
THAT'S ME.
YOU MISSED IT, MADDIE.
THE FIGHT OF THE CENTURY.
THE BARRAGE IN THE GARAGE.
TKO...
S.O.S...
S.O.B...
THAT'S ME.
I'M FINE.
I'M FINE.
CAME DOWN HERE 'CAUSE I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU, TOO.
I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW BUSY YOU WERE.
BUT NOW, OF COURSE,
I REALIZE HOW BUSY YOU ARE.
I'M FINE.
I'M GREAT, REALLY.
JUST WALKING ALONG...
SINGING A SONG.
* I'M SINGIN' IN THE RAIN *
* I'M SINGIN' IN THE RAIN *
* WHAT A GLORIOUS FEELIN' *
* I'M HAP-HAPPY AGAIN **
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH...
I DIDN'T TAKE THE FIRST SWING.
OK.
SAM, DOES IT REALLY MATTER?
YEAH.
YEAH, IT MATTERS TO ME.
JUST TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT,
I DIDN'T START ANY OF THAT.
I DIDN'T SAY YOU DID.
NO.
NO, YOU DIDN'T.
YOU HAVEN'T SAID A THING.
YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF FUNNY, MADDIE.
I COME TO PICK YOU UP FOR DINNER.
YOUR PARTNER, HE THROWS A ROADBLOCK, ON THE WAY OUT,
GRABS YOU OUT OF THE CAR,
TRIES TO SEPARATE MY HEAD FROM MY SHOULDERS.
SOMEHOW, I CAN'T SHAKE THE FEELING
THAT SOMEHOW I'M BEING CAST AS THE BAD GUY.
NOBODY'S CALLING YOU THE BAD GUY.
NOBODY'S CALLING YOU ANYTHING.
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS KINDA FUNNY?
THE LAST TIME I CHECKED MY WATCH,
IT WAS 36 HOURS SINCE I ASKED YOU WHAT I ASKED YOU,
AND I HAVEN'T HEARD THE SLIGHTEST RESPONSE,
WHICH WOULDN'T BE TOO BAD
IF THE WOMAN I HAD ASKED
ON THE VERY SAME NIGHT I ASKED HER,
HADN'T LEFT OUR BED
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
HEY, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT STICKS IN MY CRAW THE MOST.
MM-MMM.
YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT THAT IS?
THAT'S WHEN THE WOMAN I ASKED TO MARRY ME,
THE MORNING AFTER I ASK HER, TELLS HER MOTHER,
WHO I'LL LAY ODDS SHE HASN'T TALKED TO IN QUITE A WHILE,
THAT THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON.
THAT IT'S JUST THE, UH...
"SAME OLD ROUTINE."
I DON'T KNOW...
IT'S REALLY KIND OF FUNNY, MADDIE.
I'M NOT SAYING YOU DON'T WANT TO BE MARRIED.
I'M JUST SAYING MAYBE IT'S NOT TO ME.
WELL...
I DON'T THINK I FEEL MUCH LIKE HAVING DINNER.
FINE.
LET'S GO HOME.
YEAH, RIGHT.
MY HOME.
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
NOTHING.
IT MEANS NOTHING.
IT MEANS SOMETHING.
IT MEANS...
I NEED TIME!
I NEED SPACE.
I'M NOT GLIB.
IF YOU WANT GLIB, MARRY DAVID.
I'VE GOT TO THINK THIS THROUGH!
THAT'S WHO I AM.
THAT'S WHAT I AM.
AND WHILE WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT-
WILL YOU STOP YELLING?
WHO TOLD DAVID ADDISON
ABOUT YOUR PROPOSAL?
ME!
ME.
YOU?
I DID.
YES.
THANK YOU.
YOU GOT A PROBLEM?
YEAH, I GOT A PROBLEM.
IT'S NONE OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS.
NONE OF MY DAMN-
IT'S NONE OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS!
IT'S MY BUSINESS TO TELL HIM.
IT'S MY BUSINESS TO EVEN CHOOSE TO TELL HIM!
MINE!
MY BUSINESS, MY CHOICE!
MY GOD, THIS ISN'T SOMETHING YOU SETTLE
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU!
THIS IS SOMETHING I SETTLE BETWEEN THE TWO OF US!
THE ONE OF ME.
DON'T I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT ALL THIS?
YOU AND I MAY HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER 20 YEARS LONGER
THAN ME AND DAVID, WHO ISN'T THE ISSUE HERE.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN WALTZ IN HERE,
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, AND STAKE YOUR CLAIM
LIKE I WAS A PIECE OF REAL ESTATE.
I DIDN'T THINK THAT'S WHAT I DID.
WELL, THAT SURE FEELS LIKE WHAT YOU DID.
I GUESS MAYBE...
I'M JUST NOT USED TO ASKING SOMEONE TO MARRY ME.
AHH, I KNOW.
I'M NOT USED TO BEING ASKED.
HOME.
SORRY ABOUT DINNER.
IT'S OK.
I'LL TAKE A RAIN CHECK.
SAM, I THINK MAYBE I'D LIKE
TO BE BY MYSELF FOR A WHILE.
ME, TOO.
YEAH, RIGHT- NO, REALLY.
IT'S EASIER IF I GO.
NO, IT'S EASIER IF I GO.
YOU STAY HERE.
NO, YOU STAY HERE.
THIS IS YOUR HOME.
YOU HAVE NO PLACE TO GO.
I'LL GO TO SOMEBODY ELSE'S HOME.
I'LL GO TO A HOTEL.
PLEASE.
IT'S OK.
I'LL TAKE THE CAR, AND YOU TAKE THE HOUSE.
WORK OUT THE ALIMONY LATER?
I'M SORRY.
SEE YOU LATER?
YEAH...
SEE YOU LATER.
DAVID...
MISS HAYES.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO DINNER.
YEAH, I KNOW.
I DIDN'T FEEL MUCH LIKE DINNER.
I DIDN'T FEEL MUCH LIKE ANYTHING.
MR. ADDISON'S FAVORITE.
HE MUST'VE BEEN PRETTY UPSET.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, MISS DIPESTO?
IT'S LATE.
I DON'T KNOW,
JUST DIDN'T WANT HIM TO COME IN HERE TOMORROW
AND FIND THIS MESS.
HE'S SO-
I KNOW.
YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON, AGNES.
I KNOW THIS IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS, MISS HAYES,
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE MR. ADDISON
ISN'T THE ONLY ONE WHO'S UPSET AROUND HERE.
I'M FINE.
IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO...
NO.
I DON'T THINK SO.
WANT TO GET WRECKED?
EXCUSE ME?
YOU KNOW, BOMBED?
PICKLED?
POLLUTED?
ALL THE BOY DETECTIVES DO IT.
IT'S BETTER AT THE END OF THE BAR.
PEOPLE DON'T TRY TO PICK YOU UP,
AND IT'S EASIER TO GET
THE BARTENDER'S ATTENTION.
WHAT'LL IT BE, LADIES?
WHITE WINE, PLEASE.
WINE GIVES ME A HEADACHE.
I THINK I'LL HAVE...
A DOUBLE KAMIKAZE.
SO...
SO?
I DON'T KNOW.
OH...
NOT ONLY DO I NOT KNOW,
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I DON'T KNOW,
YOU KNOW?
I THINK SO.
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I HAVE A BIG PROBLEM
AND I NEED SOMEONE TO TALK TO,
I TALK TO MR. ADDISON.
I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO.
GOOD.
BUT HE USUALLY HAS GOOD ADVICE,
AND HE SAYS ONE OF THOSE CUTE LITTLE THINGS
THAT ONLY MR. ADDISON CAN SAY-
MISS DIPESTO...
OR TELLS ME ONE OF THOSE CUTE LITTLE STORIES
THAT ONLY MR. ADDISON CAN TELL.
MISS DIPESTO-
AND THEN SUDDENLY, I FEEL ALL CHEERED UP,
LIKE MAGIC,
LIKE JIFFY POP WITHOUT THE GREASE.
MISS DIPESTO, THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM
I CARE TO DISCUSS WITH MR. ADDISON.
OH.
HEY.
PEOPLE ARE THIRSTY DOWN HERE.
MAYBE THIS IS NOT SOMETHING
YOU CAN DISCUSS WITH ANYONE.
'CAUSE NO ONE ELSE KNOWS WHAT'S IN YOUR HEART.
LIKE MR. ADDISON SAYS,
"YOU CAN LEAD A HORSE TO WATER,
BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE HIM A DUCK."
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
I
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT JUST ALWAYS SOUNDS SO CUTE
WHEN MR. ADDISON SAYS IT.
I DON'T CARE WHAT MR. ADDISON SAYS.
THIS IS NOT ABOUT MR. ADDISON.
IT ISN'T?
IT ISN'T!
OH.
BARTENDER.
WHAT IS THIS, THE SELF-SERVE AISLE?
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SNAP.
I'M CONFUSED.
IT'S JUST THAT MARRIAGE IS SUCH A HUGE THING
THAT MAYBE YOU NEVER KNOW IF YOU'RE READY.
MAYBE IT ISN'T POSSIBLE TO BE SURE YOU'RE READY.
AHH...
MAYBE IT'S ONLY POSSIBLE TO BE SURE YOU'RE NOT READY.
SAM WAS RIGHT.
I OWE HIM AN ANSWER.
I OWE HIM AN ANSWER,
AND I'M GOING HOME TO GIVE HIM AN ANSWER.
THIS IS THE HARDEST THING I'VE EVER HAD TO DO.
MISS DIPESTO?
SAM.
DON'T.
DON'T MOVE, DON'T SPEAK,
DON'T EVEN LOOK AT ME.
THIS IS SO HARD.
YOU'RE SO WONDERFUL.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK FOR A MINUTE
THAT I DIDN'T TAKE YOUR PROPOSAL SERIOUSLY.
IT'S THE MOST WONDERFUL,
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ANYONE'S EVER ASKED ME.
THE THOUGHT OF MARRYING YOU,
OF HAVING A FAMILY WITH YOU...
I MAY HATE MYSELF FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.
BUT THE CRUEL TRICK IN ALL THIS IS
IF YOU'D ASKED ME 5 OR 10 YEARS AGO,
THE ANSWER WOULD'VE BEEN DIFFERENT...
BUT RIGHT NOW...
I'M SORRY.
I KNOW YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHY,
BUT YOU'RE WRONG.
I CARE ABOUT YOU SO MUCH.
I SPEND EVERY WAKING MINUTE
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN MAKE IT WORK,
BUT I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN.
NOT RIGHT NOW, NOT WITH...
SAM, YOU DESERVE SOMEONE WHO LOVES YOU,
ONLY YOU,
AND I DO LOVE YOU,
BUT NOT ONLY YOU.
I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT THIS IS FOR YOU TO HEAR.
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR ME TO SAY.
I LOVE YOU, SAM.
YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT,
BUT...
I LOVE HIM, TOO...
AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU.
I KNOW IT MEANS YOU'LL WANT TO LEAVE
AND MAYBE NEVER SEE ME AGAIN...
BUT DO ME A FAVOR.
DON'T.
AT LEAST NOT RIGHT NOW.
GIVE ME TONIGHT.
GIVE US TONIGHT.
WE'LL HOLD EACH OTHER.
WE'LL MAKE LOVE.
WE'LL SLEEP.
AND IF I WAKE UP AND YOU'RE NOT HERE,
I'LL UNDERSTAND.
JUST HOLD ME, PLEASE.
OH, SAM.
OH, MADDIE.
OOH, I LIKE THAT.
AAH!
AAH!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I WAS GETTING LUCKY.
YOU ARE THE MOST LOATHSOME,
THE MOST DISGUSTING, THE MOST VILE-
COME ON.
HOW YOU GONNA KNOW TILL YOU TRY?
WHERE'S SAM?
WHERE'S SAM?
WHERE'S SAM?
THAT KINDA QUESTION IS DEFINITELY GONNA KILL THE MOOD.
WHERE?
SAM'S GONE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN GONE?
GONE.
AS IN GOING, GOING...
I KNOW WHAT THE WORD MEANS, DAVID.
WHERE DID HE GO?
WHEN WILL HE-
WHEN I GOT HERE, HIS BAGS WERE PACKED.
THAT'S IT?
NO EXPLANATIONS, NO GOOD-BYES,
NO ANYTHING?
YEAH...
I WAS KIND OF SURPRISED, TOO.
I GUESS SPELLING DOESN'T COUNT FOR MUCH IN OUTER SPACE.
BREEZE CAME UP, BLEW IT INTO MY LAP.
LOOK...
I CAME OVER HERE BECAUSE I WANTED TO TALK.
FIGURED I OWED HIM AN APOLOGY
AND THAT I OWED YOU AN APOLOGY.
AND WHEN I GOT HERE,
HE WAS ON HIS WAY OUT THE DOOR.
HE SAID, HE DIDN'T SEE
HOW YOU AND HIM COULD MAKE IT WORK,
THAT HE THOUGHT THAT YOU HAD...
SOME OTHER THINGS
THAT YOU NEEDED TO TAKE CARE OF.
I FIGURED I'D STICK AROUND.
I'VE BEEN, EH...
TAKING THESE PAIN PILLS.
YOUR BOY SAMMY GAVE ME A PRETTY GOOD SHOT IN THE WING HERE.
SO I CAME UP HERE AND LAID DOWN,
AND THE REST, AS THEY SAY,
IS KISMET.
GO HOME, DAVID.
YOU SURE YOU REALLY WANT ME TO DO THAT?
WHAT?
MADDIE, SAM'S GONE...
AND WE'RE HERE.
SO?
SO...
SO WHAT, DAVID?
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
WHAT I'M SAYING IS...
WE...
ARE HERE.
THE TWO OF US.
TOGETHER.
ISN'T THAT WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT?
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.
THIS IS ABOUT ME.
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT WHAT I WANT.
I WAS THE ONE PROPOSED TO.
I WAS THE ONE WHO HAD A CHOICE TO MAKE,
NOT A CHOICE BETWEEN TWO MEN,
BUT A CHOICE FOR MY FUTURE, MY LIFE,
BUT I'M NOT GONNA GET A CHANCE
TO MAKE THAT CHOICE
BECAUSE AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE, AND WHO KNOWS HOW MANY OTHERS,
HAVE BEEN CONSPIRING TO MAKE IT FOR ME.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
YOU INTERRUPT OUR DINNER.
HE GOES TO YOUR APARTMENT TO DISCUSS THE PROPOSAL.
THE TWO OF YOU PLAY POPEYE AND BLUTO IN THE GARAGE.
THEN HE LEAVES, AND YOU'RE HERE.
I DON'T KNOW WHY I BOTHER SHOWING UP.
EVERYTHING SEEMS TO GET DONE
PERFECTLY WELL WITHOUT ME.
THE TWO OF YOU DID JUST FINE BY YOURSELVES.
WHAT ABOUT JUST NOW?
WHAT ABOUT JUST NOW?
I THOUGHT THAT WAS HIM, I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS YOU.
MADDIE, YOU SAID SOME THINGS THAT-
AND YOU DIDN'T.
NOTHING.
NOT DURING THE WHOLE THING, DAVID.
YOU HAVEN'T SAID A WORD.
I DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING?
STOP SMILING.
WHY ARE YOU SMILING?
HOW CAN YOU BE SO SMUG?
I'M NOT BEING SMUG.
I'M BEING HONEST.
I DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.
YOU KNOW IT, AND I KNOW IT.
YOU FEEL IT, AND I FEEL IT.
STAY AWAY FROM ME.
HERE I COME.
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU.
I NEVER WANTED YOU.
YEAH, RIGHT.
I HEARD THE SPEECH ABOUT THE GOOD-BYE GROPE.
BUT THAT WAS FOR HIM, NOT FOR YOU.
WAKE UP.
I'M NOT LEAVING HIM FOR YOU,
I'M LEAVING HIM FOR ME.
ME.
ME, ME, ME.
IS THAT CLEAR?
WHY DON'T YOU TRY IT IN C-FLAT.
GET BACK.
PUT THAT DOWN, MADDIE.
NO.
PUT IT DOWN.
NO.
I'M NOT GOING TO FORCE MYSELF ON YOU.
I DON'T WANT TO FORCE MYSELF ON YOU.
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, YOU'RE NOT WORTH IT.
WHAT?
YOU HEARD ME.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, NOT WORTH IT?
NOT WORTH IT!
NOT WORTH IT!
NO WOMAN IS WORTH THIS, ALL RIGHT?
LOOK, NEVER MIND.
ALL RIGHT?
JUST FORGET ABOUT IT.
THIS WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE.
I'M NOT WORTH IT?
I'M NOT WORTH IT?
LOOK WHO'S TALKING ABOUT WORTH!
MR. BARGAIN BASEMENT.
IF THERE WAS A CLOSE-OUT SALE ON HUMAN BEINGS,
YOU'D BE THE LAST ONE TO SELL.
YEAH, YOU OUGHT TO KNOW, HONEY.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT MEANS.
IT MEANS, YOU'RE THE KIND OF PERSON THAT GOES THROUGH LIFE
LOOKING AT THE PRICE TAGS INSTEAD OF THE MERCHANDISE.
YOU WANT SOME GUY WENT TO A GREAT SCHOOL,
GREAT MUG, NICE MANNERS.
WELL, THAT'S FINE.
JUST FINE.
MAKES SENSE.
LOOK AT YOU.
YOU'RE NOT A PERSON, YOU'RE A PÓSTER.
YOU DESERVE ANOTHER PÓSTER.
YOU'RE GOING OVER THE LINE, DAVID.
YOU SPEND MORE TIME DRESSING THAN YOU DO SMILING!
YOU SPEND MORE TIME WITH BUSINESS THAN YOU DO WITH PLEASURE.
AND YOUR WAY'S BETTER?
MORE TIME SINGING THAN WORKING?
MORE TIME SCREWING UP THAN MOVING UP?
MOVING UP?
IS THAT WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN?
SPARE ME.
IS THAT WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN, HUH?
WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE IN?
A GOOD PARTY.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I DON'T BELIEVE IN,
I DON'T BELIEVE IN WASTING ANYMORE TIME.
I'M SICK OF THIS.
TWO YEARS OF "IS YOU IS, OR IS YOU AIN'T?"
TWO YEARS OF BEES BEEING AND DUCKS DUCKING.
AND A MAN WHO THINKS THAT CULTURE IS DARK BEER.
I
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS!
I'M MISERABLE!
SO AM I.
YEAH, WELL...
I MAY HAVE JUST LET THE BEST THING
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME GET AWAY,
AND LOOK AT ME, HERE I AM,
SPENDING THE EVENING
HAVING ANOTHER POINTLESS ARGUMENT WITH YOU!
FINE.
FINE.
GOOD.
GOOD.
BITCH.
BASTARD.

And we'll fly through the day on our cloud machine as well!
while we overcome mountains!
Our strange little journey now begins!
Let's get them in hand!
The Dragon Balls!
One of the most formidable gambles in the world.
Let's go chase them down!
The Dragon Balls!
Some of the most enjoyable drama in the world.
Adventure!
there it is!
Old.
Timer!
I'm here!
Very nice!
Now spread those legs...
All right!
One. two!
One. two!
Old.
Timer...
Old.
Timer!
What?
You want to train?
Mm. hmm.
My training is kind of strict.
I don't mind.
I'm going to get even stronger than you
Old.
Timer Turtle Hermit.
do you?
I won't train you for nothing.
listen...
Huh?
what's that?
I. is it a gal?
It's a boat.
There's a strange guy riding it.
What have we here?
get him out of there.
Thank you.
areyounot?
Indeed I am.
I have come from a village far to the east.
My name is Kuririn.
Please take me as your pupil.
How good of you to come all this way.
Unfortunately.
I don't take pupils quite so easily.
Give up.
by way of salutation.
Let me think about it.
This one is nice and bouncy!
Then you have found it to you liking?
who are you?
I'm Son Goku.
I wouldn't expect you to be involved in the Budo arts.
I like budo (grapes).
Were you trying to make a joke?
Your head looks like a pachinko ball!
What are you saying!
?
Those who presume to undertake Budo would do well to shave their heads and sturdy their minds!
Look!
Don't you see Muten Roshi.sama?
I'm just normally bald.
wasn't it?
you listen too.
you must bring me a pichi-pichi gal.
What's a bitchy bitchy gag?
lively young girl.
Please leave that to me.
I will bring you one at once.
hold on.
there's no telling what kind of girl you'll choose.
I will decide in advance which girl you will bring.
And who would that be?
That would be the Sleeping Princess of Devil's Castle.
Devil's Castle?
Sleeping Princess?
there was an extremely beautiful young girl and locked up in his castle.
thousands of years went by without anyone coming to save her and they say she has gone on sleeping all that time in a dark room
Is she really that pretty?
Of course she is.
They say that those who have seen her are dazzled by her beauty and are unable to move.
and her appearance is so majestic and noble it excels all others.
she even outshines the goddesses.
That's the one.
Y. you want us to get her?
Mm. hmm.
Whichever one of you brings her back here from the castle can you do it?
Y. you bet I can do it!
Me too!
Is that right?
But where is this Devil's Castle?
You have to go far west from here... that's south.
S. sou?
Go far west from here and you will see a range of five mountains which is named Devil's Hand.
is supposed to be somewhere in those mountains.
How far to the west?
Far.
you say?
Fa... r!
This sounds like it will be fun.
I'm not about to be beaten by this runt.
you'll leave at once.
...Right!
...Uh. huh.
Kinto!
Goku!
You cannot use Kinto Un.
Kinto Un?
after all.
Both of you will go forward using only your own bodies.
okay.
Hey...
What?
so if you get into any danger
I'm not going to help you out.
that's fine.
Go!
Off we go!
I'll be going on ahead.
I ain't going to lose!
eh?
I'm going to make sure I rescue the Sleeping Princess!
How fast he is!
whatever it takes!
Goku!
...What?
...What's that there?
Hmm?
Where?
Where?
There!
There!
There!
There!
What?
you!
Don't think too badly of me.
Ciao!
What is that?
N. nothing at all!
Well if it isn't Bulma.
Muten Roshi.sama.
...Good afternoon!
...Hey there!
too?
What's up with all of you?
so we'd come see Son.kun.
I thought maybe you'd come to let me have a pafu-pafu.
me!
?
whereisGoku?
he was here this morning.
He isn't here?
Mm. mm.
He left for a little while.
Where to?
I'll bet you've sent him off on another indecent errand.
named Kuririn to Majin-jo Castle...
Er... o. or was it called Mahjongg-jo Castle?
He went to have fun at an amusement park.
Where's that?
Far to the west.
Far?
Fa... r!
I wonder if he's reached the castle yet.
Heya!
huh?
over there.
which is named the Devil's Hand.
That's Devil's Hand?
I'm going!
S. so am I!
There's a huge hole this way.
it's just a sculpture.
isn't this the place?
would it?
This is eerie.
I'm sure this must be the haunted house.
The miserable sun has finally disappeared.
Is that right?
huh?
It's making it hard to pilot...
S. stop!
T. this is creepy.
What's wrong?
it's nothing.
miss?
Who are you?
the master of this castle.
I'm Bulma.
I am so glad you were not hurt.
you... what is it?
you know.
you've gone too far.
but as a token of apology
I should like to invite you to a dinner party.
Dinner party?
too.
we shall go at once.
sir.
I shall escort you.
Come.
where are Yamucha and the others I came with?
They did not seem very appealing.
Ee. yow!
What are you kids doing here!
?
Are you the one!
?
That Sleeping Princess...
I'm not the Sleeping Princess!
that's not what I meant!
Are you the one!
?
That Sleeping Princess was taken away by!
?
I'm not the Sleeping Princess!
Where is she!
?
If I may ask?
you!
Here they come again!
you!
Nyoi. bo!
Goku!
Kuririn!
Now's my chance!
huh?
if you'll pardon the question how old are you?
I'm a spirited 16.
It sure has been a long time since we've had a 16.year. old vintage.
What do you mean?
He is talking about the drink that will be served tonight.
this is the hall.
this is a little too real.
Gentlemen!
allow me to introduce our main guest!
Miss Bulma!
Everyone's costumes are so well done.
That is because we do this every night.
where are Yamucha and the others?
only delicious treats are brought in here.
You don't mean me!
?
Bingo!
Bingo!
Bingo!
it looks like we're going to be able to toast with the live blood of a young girl.
Cut it out!
No!
Somebody!
I. I'm sure I just heard Bulma's voice!
What?
Help me!
Kuririn!
Kuririn!
Kinto Un!
Gotcha!
Goku!
ride on Kinto Un.
because you think bad things.
How was I supposed to know that!
?
You can ride on my back.
huh?
Uh. huh.
It flies wherever I want it to.
Goku...
What?
okay?
You did this on your own.
What's that?
behind you!
you!
you know!
you letch!
?
This is the area closest to the heart.
Enough of these bad jokes.
I have kept you waiting for so long!
when the Sleeping Princess will awaken from her 5000.year slumber her beautiful radiance will grant us eternal prosperity and darkness!
What do you mean?
let us toast the Sleeping Princess!
Bulma!
too!
The ceremonial blood!
Bulma!
What's going on!
?
The altar!
W. what?
What?
Protect the Sleeping Princess!
Where is the Sleeping Princess!
?
You don't mean...
Who's there!
?
They call me "Easy Pickings Lunch.
Sleeping Princess.
So that is the Sleeping Princess!
That's the bitchy bitch gag?
Seize them!
Do not let them escape!
Hold it!
Goku!
He's here!
Son.kun!
Son.kun!
Why is he leaving!
?
Bulma!
It's Yamucha!
Yamucha!
Who are you?
we were just keeping an eye on the sacrifice.
We're definitely not up to any funny business.
She sure looks like a delicious girl.
I wonder what part of her meat I'll take...
O. Oolong!
Your transformation time has run out!
no!
Move it!
Move it!
You monsters!
Hold up!
This is bad!
What happened to me?
You're all mine!
Now I can train at the Old.
Timer's place.
Hold it!
Kuririn!
Y. you're hurting me!
unless you want your friend to be killed.
Now!
All right!
Here.
G. Goku...
Let Kuririn go!
I did like you told me to!
What are you doing!
?
Hey!
Stop it!
Let go of my tail...
My power...
G. Goku...
Don't kill him.
They grow unappetizing at the moment of death.
and awaken!
You will now return to life from your 5000.year slumber!
which has lasted for too long and to bring about a world of eternal darkness...
Sleeping Princess!
Our tranquility is in darkness!
The bitter cold is our desire!
The Sleeping Princess has awakened!
unless you want your friend to be killed.
All right!
Here.
for crying out loud!
?
you idiot!
what am I doing here?
I don't know.
what are you doing?
The full moon is pretty.
Full moon?
Isn't it pretty?
G. Goku?
What?
What's the matter?
or anything... okay?
G. Goku!
Goku!
no!
stop!
She's not our enemy!
I know!
His tail is his weakness!
What?
Pu. erh!
Change into a pair of scissors and cut his tail off!
Right!
Transform!
What in the world was that!
?
pleaselook.
the dawn is coming!
It's the sun.
This is the end of the sun.
what do you mean?
What happened to me?
How come I'm naked?
There's something strange here.
Woah!
My tail is gone!
Wah!
It's gone!
It's gone!
It's gone!
My tail is gone!
About that...
I'm sorry.
well.
You're an easygoing one.
Goku!
It's Bulma!
with your limitless power to rest!
What!
?
What are you doing!
?
You don't mean you're going to use that machine on the sun?
That's right!
I'm going to blow it away!
Don't do anything stupid!
we won't be able to go swimming at the beach!
Watch closely.
This is the end of the sun!
Yamucha!
What?
Bulma!
you!
Goku!
Kuririn!
All right!
Son.kun!
Hurry and bust that thing!
the sun!
Ka... me... ha... me...
Ha!
Yikes!
Run!
Goku.
the sun didn't get wiped out.
Goku...
What?
it's nothing.
You're a strange one.
thank goodness we're all safe.
...Peace!
...Peace!
...Peace!
Very nice!
There's the Sleeping Princess for you!
As beautiful as the stories said you'd be!
my name is Lunch... too!
Roshi.sama... you're drooling.
I know!
we weren't able to bring you the Sleeping Princess... good!
How do you mean?
You two have a lot of promise.
I will make you my pupils!
R. really!
?
wasit?
You must be tired.
Come on inside and make yourself comfortable!
Right in here.
We did it!
We did it!
We did it!
right Kuririn!
?
We did it!
We did it!
Who the hell are you!
?
Hold it right there!
did I do anything bad?
not especially.
Don't you go hiding your youth!
Everyone is itching to go!
You'll never unravel the mystery of the miracle!
Go on and try to live even more wild and strong!
If you will show me your true courage.
shining dream!
[Whispering, Indistinct]
[No Audible Dialogue]
[Man] Hey!
You can't go in there without a search warrant.
What search warrant?
He's right there.
Let's go.
Why risk gettin' cited?
A few minutes isn't gonna hurt the government's case.
Yeah, yeah.
Gimme that.
You go in there with this goon, you'll be digging out of writs from now till Christmas.
Then you'd better start writing, pal, 'cause we're goin' in.
I came here to get Mosca, and that's what I'm gonna do.
So you better unlock that door, or I'm gonna kick it in.
Sonny, come on.
Sixty seconds.
Why push?
Because that slug ain't callin' the shots, that's why.
I'm ready.
Now.
[Door Opens]
Ah, gentlemen!
You have something for me?
This is for you, counsel.
Frankie.
[Man #2] Frank Mosca, you're under arrest.
[Laughs] You must be puttin' me on.
I thought this was a social call.
You have a right to remain silent.
Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law.
You have a right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you.
All right, all right.
Hurry it up, huh?
I wanna make bail and get out in time for my racquetball game.
Don't be nervous.
That's very clever, Frankie.
You're gonna have a lot of time for this where you're goin'.
Come on.
Your Honor, my client is the president of Mosca Enterprises.
I have letters here attesting... to his standing in his home community in New Jersey, as well as dozens of other communities.
He is— He is the largest contributor to NewJersey's leading charities... as well as a respected businessman.
Your Honor, there is absolutely no reason in the world that he should be denied bail.
Thank you very much.
Your Honor, Mr. Mosca heads one of the largest organized crime families in the country.
He's charged under the RICO statutes... and faces a prison term of up to almost 40 years.
He does not reside in this state.
[Judge] I am aware of the government's concern, Miss Carson, but it is my opinion that Mr. Mosca is unlikely to flee.
Bail is set at one million dollars.
[Spectators Gasp, Chatter] Court's recessed.
[Woman] Mr. Mosca.
Please!
[Chattering]
Mr. Mosca, any comment on the charges?
My client has nothing to say.
Excuse me.
[Clears Throat] Make an appointment, huh, next time you drop in.
[Woman] What's the next step in your defense?
We got 'em.
Surveillance logs.
Get 'em while they're hot.
They're signed and dated.
And the videotapes are right here.
[Castillo] Here's what we're faced with.
Mosca will go after witnesses.
He'll probably end up, uh, tryin' to intimidate or bribe or even suborn jurors.
I don't have to tell you.
Mosca will try any stunt he can think of to get a mistrial, and every time he succeeds, time passes and witnesses disappear.
[Castillo] You're all assigned toJustice to make sure that doesn't happen.
- Won't the jury be sequestered?
- No.
We're expectin' too long a trial for that.
But they will be anonymous.
Under the RICO rules, we can withhold names, employers, everything, even from Mosca's lawyers.
Mosca will go after witnesses.
Gina, Trudy and Switek will handle jurors.
Crockett and Tubbs, you guys handle the witnesses.
Before we split up, I should say, whoever your informant is, without him, the justice department... could never have made this case against Mosca.
And we'd never get him in his own state.
Great job.
Thanks.
Crawford's agents will handle federal.
Any questions?
Good.
I always take a walk when I talk business, Sid.
The greatJoey Cataglia taught me that.
You remember him?
Yeah, I remember him, Frank.
So how's it look, Sid?
It's not good, Frank.
Murder, this— this union business and now extortion.
Geez, Frank, they— they got ya on tape... taking money from some— uh, some caterer.
"Ferrushi"— "Ferruchi"— They got that on tape?
On tape.
It was a small business loan.
I set the guy up.
You did your arithmetic out loud, Frank.
All right.
Well, don't worry about it.
We'll look into it.
You gotta keep your self-confidence.
Meanwhile, I will personally be looking for leaks, looking everybody right in the eye.
Joey Cataglia taught me that too.
Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is... that I'm gonna find out who fingered me... so you don't get surprised in court.
Frank, if you do find out who's been talkin', please, please—
The thing to do is to get him on the stand so I can break down his credibility.
That may be the way they do it in Harvard, but not here.
Hey, what's the matter, Frank?
Too much soda?
No.
No, it's fine, Jimmy.
Fine.
[Clears Throat]
All I want to know is... what you told the feds.
Nothing, I— I swear, Frank.
Nothing.
See that?
I told you... thatJimmy DePalma would not inform on me!
Look me right in the eye, Jimmy.
Look me right in the eye, and tell me that you're a good soldier.
Frank, I'm a good soldier.
You know that, Frank.
So what're you tryin' to tell me, Jimmy?
Is it that you're trying to tell me you have a clear conscience?
Absolutely.
Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't.
But now it is for sure and forever, Jimmy.
Wipe everything down for prints.
Mr. Mosca.
Jack, sorry we're late.
Business.
Any problems?
Nah!
Nah, everything's copacetic.
Very good.
If you hear where maybe the feds got their case on me, I'll be real grateful.
Spread this around.
Done.
Jack, the heat is on.
I'm expecting my boys in Miami to handle it for me.
Oh, not to worry.
We're handling it.
You're handling it?
Yes, sir.
Okay.
Good.
No heavy stuff for the next few weeks, okay?
Absolutely, Mr. Mosca.
Absolutely.
Okay.
All right.
[Laughs]
All right, Rivers.
The linchpin to our Miami case is that informant of yours.
We'd have an easier time if we could use him up front.
Well, Alice, what I can tell you is that he's a loan collector for Mosca... and absolutely refuses to go into a federal Witness Protection Program.
He won't consider it?
Absolutely not.
Forget it.
I've tried many times.
He thinks anonymity is his best protection.
Frankly, I don't blame him.
I'm keeping an eye on him.
But you and your partner can't watch him full-time for the rest of his life.
Now, look, Detective, I'll be honest with you.
Mosca's lawyers are gonna trip to the fact that there's an informant.
And after my direct examination, he'll have grounds... to open that line of inquiry, and he'll want your informant named.
That would be a death warrant for my guy.
What happens if I refuse?
The judge might compel you.
If I still refuse?
He'll throw you in jail.
He'll throw me in jail.
Ah, he takes it at the 30!
He's at the 50!
Oh, geez.
What are you doin'?
You're gettin' big.
[Laughs]
Go play with this guy.
Give me a few minutes with you dad.
How you been, buddy?
All right, Terry.
How 'bout you?
All right.
[Chattering]
Jack.
Kid play too rough for ya?
Oh, man.
You got personal liability insurance?
I think I may sue you.
[Laughs]
What's up?
One more shot.
We've been through all this.
You've earned it, Jack.
Take the deal.
Look, you live with Mosca, you die with Mosca.
I'm not going into any Witness Protection Program... and change our names and hide out in some Podunk town for the rest of our lives.
We're negotiating athletic scholarships with three different colleges.
Terry deserves a shot.
I'm gonna give it to him.
Wh-What do ya mean, if something happens?
I'm not saying it will, kiddo.
I'm just saying if it does, it does.
Just you don't blow it.
I'm tryin' here to make your life better than mine.
Don't-Don't toss it away by screwing' up like I do.
You didn't screw up, Dad.
Yeah, sure.
Right.
After Mommy died, I—
I got into some things.
You know what I mean.
There's nothin' wrong with you, Dad.
There is.
What I did was dumb, and that's what I'm saying to you.
Don't be like me.
Look.
If something happens, if ya need... whatever—
Look at me.
You trust Sonny.
You hear me?
He's a friend.
Okay.
Come on, doofus.
Come on.
Let's go play some ball.
What're we doin' sitting' around here?
Please be seated.
Will the attorneys approach the bench, please.
Miss Carson, I have considered the applications that you put before this court, and I will grant you your request for an anonymous jury.
Second, I am satisfied that your arguments supporting a possible link... between the defendant and the DePalma killing are convincing.
Therefore, I am revoking the defendant's bail, effective immediately.
- [Spectators Murmuring] - [No Audible Dialogue]
- Thank you, your Honor.
- Your Honor, this is outrageous!
This is— This is persecution!
This is— This is vindictiveness!
This is—This is systematic and sadistic brutalization of my client!
[Gavel Raps]
[Judge] Mr. Shenker, I would suggest that you restrain yourself from this incoherent outburst.
- I think he's saying he doesn't like the idea.
- And that goes for you too, Miss Carson.
Bailiff, will you take Mr. Mosca into custody, please.
Sid.
Make sure I get the good cell.
And I want the 35-inch stereo TV from the den.
Louis, call Giuliano's.
Make sure they know where to send the veal cutlets.
[Spectators Chuckling]
Oh, and Louis, don't forget the cannoli.
[Laughter]
[Carson] Seven and a half pounds, ladies and gentlemen.
One of the most comprehensive indictments... of one man's contempt for the law and the rights of others ever brought by the U.S. Government.
Not one crime, but an appalling pattern of crime... inspired, controlled and committed... by that man, Frank Mosca.
During this trial, you will hear the term "crime family."
When you hear the word "family," substitute the word "business"... because Mosca Enterprises is a criminal business... with a well-defined chain of command.
[Spectators Laughing]
[Carson] Only... it is a secret, sordid business.
It has to be.
For as we will prove, Frank Mosca's real business... is loan-sharking, stealing from the unions... and murder.
[Mouths Words]
[Carson] We have three vans in the garage downstairs.
The first two vans to leave are a diversion.
They contain U.S. Marshals.
The point is to never repeat the same pattern so Mosca's men can lock on.
[Trudy] Today, the second van carries thejurors.
Tomorrow, it's male or female Metro police.
Day after, we'll use a school bus.
[Gina] Thejury rides courtesy of the school system.
[Trudy] Wednesday, it's six limos and we'll mix it up.
[Carson] Every day thejury uses a different drop point— malls, public parking, the Metrorail station.
[Gina] But Mosca's guys can't cover everything.
[Switek] Well, let's not forget, they only have to get lucky once.
[Carson] That's why the two-phase system.
Everyjuror gets an escort home.
Any tails, and we stop the parade.
No tails.
He's clean.
The prosecutor is claiming Mosca is receiving special treatment at the Metro-Dade jail.
Mosca's lawyer denied the charge.
The government makes no secret of the fact that they're out to get my client.
They've invented these ludicrous charges— special privileges, veal marsala in jail.
Come on.
My client doesn't even like veal.
Sid looks good on TV.
Louis—
Louis, do you have to go to the bathroom?
Come on.
You're my guest.
The chef at Giuliano's doesn't want any food sent back.
Ah, this place.
It just brings back a lot of memories, you know, Frank.
It crimps my appetite.
[Chuckles]
Yeah.
I know.
You done your share of time for me.
I know the dates, and I know the reasons.
I know who is loyal.
And believe me, when all this is over, those who hang in with me... will be justly rewarded.
No problem, Frank.
But, Louis, there is a problem because there's still some big mouth out there... who's tryin' to knock me down, and I want him.
We're tryin'.
Nothin'.
We're squeezing the streets dry.
See, that's the thing.
The feds work just as hard as we do to keep it off the streets.
But inside, in here, you hear things.
Am I right?
I got a couple of things for you to check out.
Sure.
Okay.
Come on.
Eat.
[Carson] Are you nervous since you heard about the DePalma killings, Mr. Ferrugi?
Why should I be nervous?
This whole thing is a misunderstanding'.
This money that I asked to borrow from Mr. Mosca.
What—
Come on, Mr. Ferrugi!
Don't weasel out on us now.
We got your original deposition right there, in which you stated...
Mr. Mosca forced you to take the money.
I have you on the stand tomorrow, Mr. Ferrugi.
It's critical.
H-How could I forget?
I was wrong.
Ten years ago, he lent me money for my daughter's wedding.
And which you are now paying back and have been paying back... at five percent a week, and you're gonna keep payin' it back.
Ferrugi, relax.
Come on now.
Settle down here.
We can walk you through this.
You're gonna be okay.
No, no, no.
Y-You don't understand.
I'm beginning to.
Mr. Ferrugi.
Thank you.
You gotta understand my position here.
Go on!
Get on outta here, Ferrugi, before you change your story again.
Oh, wait.
Here.
Thanks for the "cannolis."
Here we go.
The house of cards effect.
Guys like Mosca know they can make our case crumble by scaring the hell out of people.
First one witness, then two,
then 10.
[Shenker] So in all your time as trustee of the pension fund for Local 135,
Mr. Shawcross, y-you never once actually met Mr. Mosca?
Is that correct?
That's correct.
Never met him.
Well, didn't you find that a little strange, Mr. Shawcross, that as trustee, you never met the man the government claims controls this fund?
Objection!
[Judge] Sustained.
[Shenker] No further, Your Honor.
- If I may, Your Honor?
- Certainly, Miss Carson.
Mr. Shawcross, in your capacity as trustee, did you withdraw an amount of cash every week... and place it in a manila envelope?
Yes, I did.
Well, was it a plain manila envelope?
No, it bore the insignia "Mosca Enterprises."
An envelope like this?
Yes.
Your Honor, I'd like this envelope marked government exhibit 151 and admitted.
[Shenker] Your Honor, may I see this... envelope?
Thank you.
Now, uh, Mr. Shawcross, did there come a time when you met with an agent of the F.B.I.?
[Shawcross] Yes, Miss Carson.
And, um, did the agent approach you with some... foreknowledge of the illegalities of Mosca Enterprises?
- Get down!
- [Spectators Gasp]
[Gavel Raps] Order!
I want order in this courtroom!
Bailiff!
Order!
I want order in this court.
Bailiff, clear the court!
I needn't remind you that this is a court oflaw.
I want both counsels in my chambers at once.
This court is in recess.
Louis.
This is ex-Officer Crimmer, boss.
He's got something you oughta hear.
[Door Closes]
I read about your trial, Mosca.
Uh, I used to work for County.
Well, uh, when I worked there, uh, a detective in our unit was tailing a guy from your outfit.
A guy named Rivers.
Well, this detective, a good friend of mine— suddenly he's off the case.
Seems this guy, uh, Rivers, was busted over here in Dade... and snitched.
Ex-Officer Crimmer, this information is very valuable to me.
As you know, I'm a generous man, especially to those who do me favors.
Now, I hope you don't think me rude, but Mr. Brisco and I have a few things to discuss.
Anytime, Mosca.
[Buzzer]
[Door Closes]
Want me to take care of it, boss?
No.
No, Louis.
Not that way.
I got a better idea.
[Carson] Detective, you were present at the surveillance post... throughout the evening of August 4?
[Crockett] Yes, ma'am.
Will you tell the jury, Detective, what gave you cause to believe... that Mr. Mosca was receiving an illegal loan payment.
[Crockett] Well, we heard on the parabolic mike... the defendant use the term "juice,"
which is street slang for an extortionate rate of interest.
Thank you, Detective.
Detective, have you ever operated recording equipment... on 19th Street before August 4 last?
- Many times.
- You've—You've caught pimps and hookers doing business.
And sometimes loan sharks.
L-Isn't it a fact, Detective, that on August 4 last, you had no interest in pimps and hookers?
Counsel, Vice always has interest in pimps and hookers.
[Spectators Laughing]
Very funny.
Very funny, Detective.
But, uh, as I see here... in this news clip dated August 1, well, there was a major Vice roundup conducted... on the evenings ofJuly 28 and 29.
What's your question, counsel?
The ques— Oh, the question, Detective, is... isn't it a fact that when you went to 19th Street on August 4, you had no intention of arresting pimps and hookers.
You were there because an informant had told you that Frank Mosca was going to be there.
Detective, I must direct you to answer the question.
You've cleared the courtroom.
We've taken all the precautions.
You don't have to worry about security.
- I understand that, Your Honor, but— - "But." "But." "But." But what, Detective?
Yes, there was an informant involved.
Ninety percent of undercover work involves the information from informants.
And in this case, Detective, who was yours?
Your Honor, counsel is asking the detective to betray a confidence.
- Oh, that's hardly relevant.
- It's most certainly relevant to the safety of this informant.
Undoubtedly a three-time loser who traded lies about my client for a free hand to make book.
Objection.
Counsel has established no basis for these slanders.
Public identification will put the witness's life in danger.
Sell dope and run prostitutes... while venal law officers like this one look the other way.
[Gavel Raps]
Common decency demands— For once I agree with the government counsel.
Common decency demands that we dismiss this entire indictment, which is nothing but a stew of rancid meat... that makes me want to retch and vomit!
[Judge] Mr. Shenker!
Both attorneys approach the bench.
I want this off the record.
I am beginning to feel more like a lion tamer than a justice.
Where do you learn such courtroom behavior?
As I said, Your Honor, before, the detective is very concerned about the safety of his informant.
And I must insist again on the substantial need of my client for cross-examination.
Rules of disclosure.
Yes, yes, yes.
I know all about the rules of disclosure, Mr. Shenker.
Proceed!
Now, Detective, who told you you'd find Frank Mosca on 19th Street that night?
I refuse to say.
[Judge] Detective,
I must order you to answer the question.
If you refuse, I will have to hold you in contempt.
I'm sorry, Your Honor, but I cannot say.
It will endanger the life of my informant... and inhibit my ability to do myjob.
Then, Detective, you are in contempt of this court.
Bailiff, confine the detective to the Metro-Dade facility.
Court is recessed.
[Gavel Raps]
[Spectators Murmuring]
Officer, I was standing at the window and I watched these two men—
Hey, Terry!
Are you all right?
Rico.
Two guys show up early this morning.
They woke up the whole entire neighborhood, man.
They made a big racket.
They—They took my dad, Rico.
Who were they?
I don't know.
Nobody knows.
They just— They came, uh, they left.
They were gone.
My father left everything.
He left the car, his wallet.
Everything, man.
So where were you?
I just got back.
I was in the play-offs over in Lauderdale.
What's happened to my dad, Rico?
You gotta tell me what's going on.
Hey, look, look.
Hey, you know your father kept some pretty tough company.
Do you have any idea?
Aw, come on.
Nothing like this ever happened before.
Why can't you tell me what's goin' on?
Look, we'll have plenty of answers once we find your father.
Right now, I don't want to worry about you.
Look, you got anybody you can stay with?
Any friends?
Anybody?
I, uh— I don't know.
I'll stay with somebody on the football team.
Okay.
Excuse me, Officer.
If you could help him get his bags together... and then give him a ride to his friend's house, I'd sure appreciate it.
Just be cool, you hear?
It's gonna be all right.
Rico, find my dad, man.
Bring him back.
[Phone Ringing]
Hello.
[Trudy] Rico, I think I found Rivers.
Alive?
So far.
I was running this morning's wants and warrants.
County sheriff's office popped him this morning.
Possession with intent.
Are you kiddin'?
Rivers is no drug dealer.
He wouldn't come within a city block of drugs.
Maybe, but he's being held at Metro-Dade.
Mosca set this up.
Listen, Trudy, call Carson and have her get ahold ofJudge Delaporte... and spring Rivers now.
Bailiff!
Hey, I need to make a phone call.
I can't hear you, Rivers.
Sign here.
Cell 51, "D" Block.
Enjoy your stay, Rivers.
[Lock Buzzes] [Man Singing]
[Man Whistles]
[Continues]
[Continues]
[Fades]
Hey, Burnett.
Sonny, is that you?
Mickey Shapiro.
Remember me?
- Hey, Mickey.
- Hey, what happened?
The heat catch that big, fast boat of yours with some weight on it maybe?
Nah.
I was havin' a little party and, uh, some narc crashed it.
Busted me with a lousy two keys.
Ya ready for that?
Yeah.
Well, uh, you showed up at the right time.
There might be some fun in the ol'doghouse tonight.
Yeah?
What's the buzz, Mickey?
What's goin' down?
Some guy got brought in, the guy who snitched on Frank Mosca.
[Doorbell Rings]
We're here to see the judge.
It's an urgent matter.
Hello, Judge Delaporte.
Excuse us for interrupting your afternoon.
- Hello, Judge.
- Detective Tubbs.
A federal witness was arrested today and incarcerated at the Metro-Dade facility.
The circumstances surrounding his arrest are suspect at best.
Yeah.
We believe he's in specific danger of being killed while inside that facility.
I took the liberty of typing up an order requesting you to authorize the release of this witness.
He'll remain in Detective Tubbs's custody pending a review of the matter.
"Rivers"?
I don't recall seeing this name on the witness list, Miss Carson.
Your Honor, this man's value as a potential witness only recently came to light.
I'll sign it.
Thank you so much, Your Honor.
Have a good day.
Have a good day.
Trudy, call the Metro-Dade lockup.
We got a release.
Tell them to bring Rivers down to the release area now.
Tubbs clear.
Nice work, Counselor.
Rivers.
Huh?
You're wanted downstairs.
There's a Detective Tubbs waiting.
You're gettin' out.
[Buzzes]
What is the delay?
They'll be bringing him down in a minute.
[Door Opens, Closes]
[Crockett] Jack.
Sonny.
What the hell's goin' on?
It's okay.
Rico's downstairs.
I'm gettin' out.
[Exhales]
Don't worry, Sonny.
It's okay.
[Stabbing Flesh] [Jack Gasps]
Jack?
Jack?
Jack!
I never figured you for a cop, Sonny.
Just never figured it.
[Sighs]
Your father was... trying to help us, Terry.
But he knew too much, right?
It was worth his life... so you could get Mosca, huh?
Is that what you came to tell me, Sonny?
You were his friend, right?
Where the heck were ya?
Huh?
Where were ya, pal?
He knew it was comin', Sonny.
Said if anything happened to him,
I was to give you this.
It's Mosca's personal diaries, copies of his bank accounts.
So what do you think, Sonny?
Can you get him with this?
[Carson] This is everything we need.
Every record of every payment collected or paid to Frank Mosca.
Oh, they've indicted the con and the guard responsible for Rivers's murder.
We gonna have any trouble getting this admitted, Alice?
No.
There won't be any problem with authenticity or relevance.
This is one round our friend, Mr. Mosca, is going to lose.
[Judge Delaporte] Miss Carson, I have examined this new evidence submitted by the government.
It relates directly to the case, and I can find no reason why it should not be admitted.
[Shenker] Uh, Your Honor, for the record, the defense objects to the introduction of this, uh, so-called evidence as irrelevant to these proceedings.
It will only unfairly prejudice against my client.
Your objection is noted, Mr. Shenker.
If this case ends in a conviction, you have the right of appeal.
You may proceed, Miss Carson.
Thank you, Your Honor.
[Paper Rustling]
Um, the next witness in this case will be a Mr. Bianco.
Your Honor, an important matter has just been brought to my attention.
It will be necessary to excuse the jury, Your Honor.
[Spectators Murmuring]
[Judge Delaporte] Bailiff, escort thejury to the waiting room.
What's this all about, Miss Carson?
Your Honor, this letter states that a juror in this case,
Juror Number Seven, has received substantial money— money which was paid to him to influence his vote.
The letter even states where the money can be found, Your Honor.
I'll see both counsel in my chambers at once.
That's not mine.
I've never seen that bag before in my life.
[Carson] Mosca planted it to get a mistrial.
I thought we were watching.
We were.
But not close enough.
I am... angered... that the security measures in this trial have been effectively breached, and I have my own theories as to how that happened, but if I let this trial go to term, an appeal is certain.
- Correct, Mr. Shenker?
- Quite certain, Your Honor.
Therefore, I have no choice... but to declare a mistrial and release thejury.
[People Whistling]
I will entertain written motions from the government to refile for a new trial, Miss Carson, whenever the calendar permits.
Uh, Your Honor, pending a decision on the part of the government as to the disposition of this case, and in view of the length of time usually required, the defense requests that the defendant be released on bail.
Yes, I'll grant that, Mr. Shenker, subject to revocation.
Bail is set at the original one million dollars.
[Woman] Can we get a statement, Mr. Mosca?
My client will say a few words outside.
You play racquetball, Crockett?
I got a court at 7:00.
Excuse me.
[Chattering]
[Woman] Did you attempt to bribe a juror, Mr. Mosca?
Did I bribe a juror?
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
I don't bribe people.
I don't bribe people.
It's against the law.
[Woman #2] Does the government have a vendetta against you, Mr. Mosca?
Well, what would you call it?
An admiration society?
That's all for now, ladies and gentlemen.
I'll have a statement for the press.
Follow me over here, please.
[Clamoring]
- Mosca!
- [Woman Screams]
- Terry—
- Stay away, Sonny.
Just stay away.
Don't do it, man.
Don't... do it.
This guy killed my father, Sonny, and he's just walkin' away.
[Crockett] Terry, if you go offbehind this, you mess it all up, man— the whole thing.
My father gave his life for this bastard, and the judge just let him walk?
Business as usual, I guess.
Huh, Sonny?
Terry—
What does it mean, man?
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
Terry.
Man, I feel the same as you, but this guy's only gonna be on the street for as long as it takes for a new trial.
Don't blow it, man.
Please don't blow it.
That's what your father did it for.
Terry, that's what it means, man.
[Gunshot]
Go ahead, Mosca.
Make it easy.
[No Audible Dialogue]
[Man] Hey!
You can't go in there without a search warrant.
What search warrant?
He's right there.
Let's go.
Why risk gettin' cited?
A few minutes isn't gonna hurt the government's case.
Yeah, yeah.
Gimme that.
You go in there with this goon, you'll be digging out of writs from now till Christmas.
Then you'd better start writing, pal, 'cause we're goin' in.
I came here to get Mosca, and that's what I'm gonna do.
So you better unlock that door, or I'm gonna kick it in.
Sonny, come on.
Sixty seconds.
Why push?
Because that slug ain't callin' the shots, that's why.
I'm ready.
Now.
[Door Opens]
Ah, gentlemen!
You have something for me?
This is for you, counsel.
Frankie.
[Man #2] Frank Mosca, you're under arrest.
[Laughs] You must be puttin' me on.
I thought this was a social call.
You have a right to remain silent.
Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law.
You have a right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you.
All right, all right.
Hurry it up, huh?
I wanna make bail and get out in time for my racquetball game.
Don't be nervous.
That's very clever, Frankie.
You're gonna have a lot of time for this where you're goin'.
Come on.
Your Honor, my client is the president of Mosca Enterprises.
I have letters here attesting... to his standing in his home community in New Jersey, as well as dozens of other communities.
He is— He is the largest contributor to NewJersey's leading charities... as well as a respected businessman.
Your Honor, there is absolutely no reason in the world that he should be denied bail.
Thank you very much.
Your Honor, Mr. Mosca heads one of the largest organized crime families in the country.
He's charged under the RICO statutes... and faces a prison term of up to almost 40 years.
He does not reside in this state.
[Judge] I am aware of the government's concern, Miss Carson, but it is my opinion that Mr. Mosca is unlikely to flee.
Bail is set at one million dollars.
[Spectators Gasp, Chatter] Court's recessed.
[Woman] Mr. Mosca.
Please!
[Chattering]
Mr. Mosca, any comment on the charges?
My client has nothing to say.
Excuse me.
[Clears Throat] Make an appointment, huh, next time you drop in.
[Woman] What's the next step in your defense?
We got 'em.
Surveillance logs.
Get 'em while they're hot.
They're signed and dated.
And the videotapes are right here.
[Castillo] Here's what we're faced with.
Mosca will go after witnesses.
He'll probably end up, uh, tryin' to intimidate or bribe or even suborn jurors.
I don't have to tell you.
Mosca will try any stunt he can think of to get a mistrial, and every time he succeeds, time passes and witnesses disappear.
[Castillo] You're all assigned toJustice to make sure that doesn't happen.
- Won't the jury be sequestered?
- No.
We're expectin' too long a trial for that.
But they will be anonymous.
Under the RICO rules, we can withhold names, employers, everything, even from Mosca's lawyers.
Mosca will go after witnesses.
Gina, Trudy and Switek will handle jurors.
Crockett and Tubbs, you guys handle the witnesses.
Before we split up, I should say, whoever your informant is, without him, the justice department... could never have made this case against Mosca.
And we'd never get him in his own state.
Great job.
Thanks.
Crawford's agents will handle federal.
Any questions?
Good.
I always take a walk when I talk business, Sid.
The greatJoey Cataglia taught me that.
You remember him?
Yeah, I remember him, Frank.
So how's it look, Sid?
It's not good, Frank.
Murder, this— this union business and now extortion.
Geez, Frank, they— they got ya on tape... taking money from some— uh, some caterer.
"Ferrushi"— "Ferruchi"— They got that on tape?
On tape.
It was a small business loan.
I set the guy up.
You did your arithmetic out loud, Frank.
All right.
Well, don't worry about it.
We'll look into it.
You gotta keep your self-confidence.
Meanwhile, I will personally be looking for leaks, looking everybody right in the eye.
Joey Cataglia taught me that too.
Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is... that I'm gonna find out who fingered me... so you don't get surprised in court.
Frank, if you do find out who's been talkin', please, please—
The thing to do is to get him on the stand so I can break down his credibility.
That may be the way they do it in Harvard, but not here.
Hey, what's the matter, Frank?
Too much soda?
No.
No, it's fine, Jimmy.
Fine.
[Clears Throat]
All I want to know is... what you told the feds.
Nothing, I— I swear, Frank.
Nothing.
See that?
I told you... thatJimmy DePalma would not inform on me!
Look me right in the eye, Jimmy.
Look me right in the eye, and tell me that you're a good soldier.
Frank, I'm a good soldier.
You know that, Frank.
So what're you tryin' to tell me, Jimmy?
Is it that you're trying to tell me you have a clear conscience?
Absolutely.
Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't.
But now it is for sure and forever, Jimmy.
Wipe everything down for prints.
Mr. Mosca.
Jack, sorry we're late.
Business.
Any problems?
Nah!
Nah, everything's copacetic.
Very good.
If you hear where maybe the feds got their case on me, I'll be real grateful.
Spread this around.
Done.
Jack, the heat is on.
I'm expecting my boys in Miami to handle it for me.
Oh, not to worry.
We're handling it.
You're handling it?
Yes, sir.
Okay.
Good.
No heavy stuff for the next few weeks, okay?
Absolutely, Mr. Mosca.
Absolutely.
Okay.
All right.
[Laughs]
All right, Rivers.
The linchpin to our Miami case is that informant of yours.
We'd have an easier time if we could use him up front.
Well, Alice, what I can tell you is that he's a loan collector for Mosca... and absolutely refuses to go into a federal Witness Protection Program.
He won't consider it?
Absolutely not.
Forget it.
I've tried many times.
He thinks anonymity is his best protection.
Frankly, I don't blame him.
I'm keeping an eye on him.
But you and your partner can't watch him full-time for the rest of his life.
Now, look, Detective, I'll be honest with you.
Mosca's lawyers are gonna trip to the fact that there's an informant.
And after my direct examination, he'll have grounds... to open that line of inquiry, and he'll want your informant named.
That would be a death warrant for my guy.
What happens if I refuse?
The judge might compel you.
If I still refuse?
He'll throw you in jail.
He'll throw me in jail.
Ah, he takes it at the 30!
He's at the 50!
Oh, geez.
What are you doin'?
You're gettin' big.
[Laughs]
Go play with this guy.
Give me a few minutes with you dad.
How you been, buddy?
All right, Terry.
How 'bout you?
All right.
[Chattering]
Jack.
Kid play too rough for ya?
Oh, man.
You got personal liability insurance?
I think I may sue you.
[Laughs]
What's up?
One more shot.
We've been through all this.
You've earned it, Jack.
Take the deal.
Look, you live with Mosca, you die with Mosca.
I'm not going into any Witness Protection Program... and change our names and hide out in some Podunk town for the rest of our lives.
We're negotiating athletic scholarships with three different colleges.
Terry deserves a shot.
I'm gonna give it to him.
Wh-What do ya mean, if something happens?
I'm not saying it will, kiddo.
I'm just saying if it does, it does.
Just you don't blow it.
I'm tryin' here to make your life better than mine.
Don't-Don't toss it away by screwing' up like I do.
You didn't screw up, Dad.
Yeah, sure.
Right.
After Mommy died, I—
I got into some things.
You know what I mean.
There's nothin' wrong with you, Dad.
There is.
What I did was dumb, and that's what I'm saying to you.
Don't be like me.
Look.
If something happens, if ya need... whatever—
Look at me.
You trust Sonny.
You hear me?
He's a friend.
Okay.
Come on, doofus.
Come on.
Let's go play some ball.
What're we doin' sitting' around here?
Please be seated.
Will the attorneys approach the bench, please.
Miss Carson, I have considered the applications that you put before this court, and I will grant you your request for an anonymous jury.
Second, I am satisfied that your arguments supporting a possible link... between the defendant and the DePalma killing are convincing.
Therefore, I am revoking the defendant's bail, effective immediately.
- [Spectators Murmuring] - [No Audible Dialogue]
- Thank you, your Honor.
- Your Honor, this is outrageous!
This is— This is persecution!
This is— This is vindictiveness!
This is—This is systematic and sadistic brutalization of my client!
[Gavel Raps]
[Judge] Mr. Shenker, I would suggest that you restrain yourself from this incoherent outburst.
- I think he's saying he doesn't like the idea.
- And that goes for you too, Miss Carson.
Bailiff, will you take Mr. Mosca into custody, please.
Sid.
Make sure I get the good cell.
And I want the 35-inch stereo TV from the den.
Louis, call Giuliano's.
Make sure they know where to send the veal cutlets.
[Spectators Chuckling]
Oh, and Louis, don't forget the cannoli.
[Laughter]
[Carson] Seven and a half pounds, ladies and gentlemen.
One of the most comprehensive indictments... of one man's contempt for the law and the rights of others ever brought by the U.S. Government.
Not one crime, but an appalling pattern of crime... inspired, controlled and committed... by that man, Frank Mosca.
During this trial, you will hear the term "crime family."
When you hear the word "family," substitute the word "business"... because Mosca Enterprises is a criminal business... with a well-defined chain of command.
[Spectators Laughing]
[Carson] Only... it is a secret, sordid business.
It has to be.
For as we will prove, Frank Mosca's real business... is loan-sharking, stealing from the unions... and murder.
[Mouths Words]
[Carson] We have three vans in the garage downstairs.
The first two vans to leave are a diversion.
They contain U.S. Marshals.
The point is to never repeat the same pattern so Mosca's men can lock on.
[Trudy] Today, the second van carries thejurors.
Tomorrow, it's male or female Metro police.
Day after, we'll use a school bus.
[Gina] Thejury rides courtesy of the school system.
[Trudy] Wednesday, it's six limos and we'll mix it up.
[Carson] Every day thejury uses a different drop point— malls, public parking, the Metrorail station.
[Gina] But Mosca's guys can't cover everything.
[Switek] Well, let's not forget, they only have to get lucky once.
[Carson] That's why the two-phase system.
Everyjuror gets an escort home.
Any tails, and we stop the parade.
No tails.
He's clean.
The prosecutor is claiming Mosca is receiving special treatment at the Metro-Dade jail.
Mosca's lawyer denied the charge.
The government makes no secret of the fact that they're out to get my client.
They've invented these ludicrous charges— special privileges, veal marsala in jail.
Come on.
My client doesn't even like veal.
Sid looks good on TV.
Louis—
Louis, do you have to go to the bathroom?
Come on.
You're my guest.
The chef at Giuliano's doesn't want any food sent back.
Ah, this place.
It just brings back a lot of memories, you know, Frank.
It crimps my appetite.
[Chuckles]
Yeah.
I know.
You done your share of time for me.
I know the dates, and I know the reasons.
I know who is loyal.
And believe me, when all this is over, those who hang in with me... will be justly rewarded.
No problem, Frank.
But, Louis, there is a problem because there's still some big mouth out there... who's tryin' to knock me down, and I want him.
We're tryin'.
Nothin'.
We're squeezing the streets dry.
See, that's the thing.
The feds work just as hard as we do to keep it off the streets.
But inside, in here, you hear things.
Am I right?
I got a couple of things for you to check out.
Sure.
Okay.
Come on.
Eat.
[Carson] Are you nervous since you heard about the DePalma killings, Mr. Ferrugi?
Why should I be nervous?
This whole thing is a misunderstanding'.
This money that I asked to borrow from Mr. Mosca.
What—
Come on, Mr. Ferrugi!
Don't weasel out on us now.
We got your original deposition right there, in which you stated...
Mr. Mosca forced you to take the money.
I have you on the stand tomorrow, Mr. Ferrugi.
It's critical.
H-How could I forget?
I was wrong.
Ten years ago, he lent me money for my daughter's wedding.
And which you are now paying back and have been paying back... at five percent a week, and you're gonna keep payin' it back.
Ferrugi, relax.
Come on now.
Settle down here.
We can walk you through this.
You're gonna be okay.
No, no, no.
Y-You don't understand.
I'm beginning to.
Mr. Ferrugi.
Thank you.
You gotta understand my position here.
Go on!
Get on outta here, Ferrugi, before you change your story again.
Oh, wait.
Here.
Thanks for the "cannolis."
Here we go.
The house of cards effect.
Guys like Mosca know they can make our case crumble by scaring the hell out of people.
First one witness, then two,
then 10.
[Shenker] So in all your time as trustee of the pension fund for Local 135,
Mr. Shawcross, y-you never once actually met Mr. Mosca?
Is that correct?
That's correct.
Never met him.
Well, didn't you find that a little strange, Mr. Shawcross, that as trustee, you never met the man the government claims controls this fund?
Objection!
[Judge] Sustained.
[Shenker] No further, Your Honor.
- If I may, Your Honor?
- Certainly, Miss Carson.
Mr. Shawcross, in your capacity as trustee, did you withdraw an amount of cash every week... and place it in a manila envelope?
Yes, I did.
Well, was it a plain manila envelope?
No, it bore the insignia "Mosca Enterprises."
An envelope like this?
Yes.
Your Honor, I'd like this envelope marked government exhibit 151 and admitted.
[Shenker] Your Honor, may I see this... envelope?
Thank you.
Now, uh, Mr. Shawcross, did there come a time when you met with an agent of the F.B.I.?
[Shawcross] Yes, Miss Carson.
And, um, did the agent approach you with some... foreknowledge of the illegalities of Mosca Enterprises?
- Get down!
- [Spectators Gasp]
[Gavel Raps] Order!
I want order in this courtroom!
Bailiff!
Order!
I want order in this court.
Bailiff, clear the court!
I needn't remind you that this is a court oflaw.
I want both counsels in my chambers at once.
This court is in recess.
Louis.
This is ex-Officer Crimmer, boss.
He's got something you oughta hear.
[Door Closes]
I read about your trial, Mosca.
Uh, I used to work for County.
Well, uh, when I worked there, uh, a detective in our unit was tailing a guy from your outfit.
A guy named Rivers.
Well, this detective, a good friend of mine— suddenly he's off the case.
Seems this guy, uh, Rivers, was busted over here in Dade... and snitched.
Ex-Officer Crimmer, this information is very valuable to me.
As you know, I'm a generous man, especially to those who do me favors.
Now, I hope you don't think me rude, but Mr. Brisco and I have a few things to discuss.
Anytime, Mosca.
[Buzzer]
[Door Closes]
Want me to take care of it, boss?
No.
No, Louis.
Not that way.
I got a better idea.
[Carson] Detective, you were present at the surveillance post... throughout the evening of August 4?
[Crockett] Yes, ma'am.
Will you tell the jury, Detective, what gave you cause to believe... that Mr. Mosca was receiving an illegal loan payment.
[Crockett] Well, we heard on the parabolic mike... the defendant use the term "juice,"
which is street slang for an extortionate rate of interest.
Thank you, Detective.
Detective, have you ever operated recording equipment... on 19th Street before August 4 last?
- Many times.
- You've—You've caught pimps and hookers doing business.
And sometimes loan sharks.
L-Isn't it a fact, Detective, that on August 4 last, you had no interest in pimps and hookers?
Counsel, Vice always has interest in pimps and hookers.
[Spectators Laughing]
Very funny.
Very funny, Detective.
But, uh, as I see here... in this news clip dated August 1, well, there was a major Vice roundup conducted... on the evenings ofJuly 28 and 29.
What's your question, counsel?
The ques— Oh, the question, Detective, is... isn't it a fact that when you went to 19th Street on August 4, you had no intention of arresting pimps and hookers.
You were there because an informant had told you that Frank Mosca was going to be there.
Detective, I must direct you to answer the question.
You've cleared the courtroom.
We've taken all the precautions.
You don't have to worry about security.
- I understand that, Your Honor, but— - "But." "But." "But." But what, Detective?
Yes, there was an informant involved.
Ninety percent of undercover work involves the information from informants.
And in this case, Detective, who was yours?
Your Honor, counsel is asking the detective to betray a confidence.
- Oh, that's hardly relevant.
- It's most certainly relevant to the safety of this informant.
Undoubtedly a three-time loser who traded lies about my client for a free hand to make book.
Objection.
Counsel has established no basis for these slanders.
Public identification will put the witness's life in danger.
Sell dope and run prostitutes... while venal law officers like this one look the other way.
[Gavel Raps]
Common decency demands— For once I agree with the government counsel.
Common decency demands that we dismiss this entire indictment, which is nothing but a stew of rancid meat... that makes me want to retch and vomit!
[Judge] Mr. Shenker!
Both attorneys approach the bench.
I want this off the record.
I am beginning to feel more like a lion tamer than a justice.
Where do you learn such courtroom behavior?
As I said, Your Honor, before, the detective is very concerned about the safety of his informant.
And I must insist again on the substantial need of my client for cross-examination.
Rules of disclosure.
Yes, yes, yes.
I know all about the rules of disclosure, Mr. Shenker.
Proceed!
Now, Detective, who told you you'd find Frank Mosca on 19th Street that night?
I refuse to say.
[Judge] Detective,
I must order you to answer the question.
If you refuse, I will have to hold you in contempt.
I'm sorry, Your Honor, but I cannot say.
It will endanger the life of my informant... and inhibit my ability to do myjob.
Then, Detective, you are in contempt of this court.
Bailiff, confine the detective to the Metro-Dade facility.
Court is recessed.
[Gavel Raps]
[Spectators Murmuring]
Officer, I was standing at the window and I watched these two men—
Hey, Terry!
Are you all right?
Rico.
Two guys show up early this morning.
They woke up the whole entire neighborhood, man.
They made a big racket.
They—They took my dad, Rico.
Who were they?
I don't know.
Nobody knows.
They just— They came, uh, they left.
They were gone.
My father left everything.
He left the car, his wallet.
Everything, man.
So where were you?
I just got back.
I was in the play-offs over in Lauderdale.
What's happened to my dad, Rico?
You gotta tell me what's going on.
Hey, look, look.
Hey, you know your father kept some pretty tough company.
Do you have any idea?
Aw, come on.
Nothing like this ever happened before.
Why can't you tell me what's goin' on?
Look, we'll have plenty of answers once we find your father.
Right now, I don't want to worry about you.
Look, you got anybody you can stay with?
Any friends?
Anybody?
I, uh— I don't know.
I'll stay with somebody on the football team.
Okay.
Excuse me, Officer.
If you could help him get his bags together... and then give him a ride to his friend's house, I'd sure appreciate it.
Just be cool, you hear?
It's gonna be all right.
Rico, find my dad, man.
Bring him back.
[Phone Ringing]
Hello.
[Trudy] Rico, I think I found Rivers.
Alive?
So far.
I was running this morning's wants and warrants.
County sheriff's office popped him this morning.
Possession with intent.
Are you kiddin'?
Rivers is no drug dealer.
He wouldn't come within a city block of drugs.
Maybe, but he's being held at Metro-Dade.
Mosca set this up.
Listen, Trudy, call Carson and have her get ahold ofJudge Delaporte... and spring Rivers now.
Bailiff!
Hey, I need to make a phone call.
I can't hear you, Rivers.
Sign here.
Cell 51, "D" Block.
Enjoy your stay, Rivers.

[Fades]
Hey, Burnett.
Sonny, is that you?
Mickey Shapiro.
Remember me?
- Hey, Mickey.
- Hey, what happened?
The heat catch that big, fast boat of yours with some weight on it maybe?
Nah.
I was havin' a little party and, uh, some narc crashed it.
Busted me with a lousy two keys.
Ya ready for that?
Yeah.
Well, uh, you showed up at the right time.
There might be some fun in the ol'doghouse tonight.
Yeah?
What's the buzz, Mickey?
What's goin' down?
Some guy got brought in, the guy who snitched on Frank Mosca.
[Doorbell Rings]
We're here to see the judge.
It's an urgent matter.
Hello, Judge Delaporte.
Excuse us for interrupting your afternoon.
- Hello, Judge.
- Detective Tubbs.
A federal witness was arrested today and incarcerated at the Metro-Dade facility.
The circumstances surrounding his arrest are suspect at best.
Yeah.
We believe he's in specific danger of being killed while inside that facility.
I took the liberty of typing up an order requesting you to authorize the release of this witness.
He'll remain in Detective Tubbs's custody pending a review of the matter.
"Rivers"?
I don't recall seeing this name on the witness list, Miss Carson.
Your Honor, this man's value as a potential witness only recently came to light.
I'll sign it.
Thank you so much, Your Honor.
Have a good day.
Have a good day.
Trudy, call the Metro-Dade lockup.
We got a release.
Tell them to bring Rivers down to the release area now.
Tubbs clear.
Nice work, Counselor.
Rivers.
Huh?
You're wanted downstairs.
There's a Detective Tubbs waiting.
You're gettin' out.
[Buzzes]
What is the delay?
They'll be bringing him down in a minute.
[Door Opens, Closes]
[Crockett] Jack.
Sonny.
What the hell's goin' on?
It's okay.
Rico's downstairs.
I'm gettin' out.
[Exhales]
Don't worry, Sonny.
It's okay.
[Stabbing Flesh] [Jack Gasps]
Jack?
Jack?
Jack!
I never figured you for a cop, Sonny.
Just never figured it.
[Sighs]
Your father was... trying to help us, Terry.
But he knew too much, right?
It was worth his life... so you could get Mosca, huh?
Is that what you came to tell me, Sonny?
You were his friend, right?
Where the heck were ya?
Huh?
Where were ya, pal?
He knew it was comin', Sonny.
Said if anything happened to him,
I was to give you this.
It's Mosca's personal diaries, copies of his bank accounts.
So what do you think, Sonny?
Can you get him with this?
[Carson] This is everything we need.
Every record of every payment collected or paid to Frank Mosca.
Oh, they've indicted the con and the guard responsible for Rivers's murder.
We gonna have any trouble getting this admitted, Alice?
No.
There won't be any problem with authenticity or relevance.
This is one round our friend, Mr. Mosca, is going to lose.
[Judge Delaporte] Miss Carson, I have examined this new evidence submitted by the government.
It relates directly to the case, and I can find no reason why it should not be admitted.
[Shenker] Uh, Your Honor, for the record, the defense objects to the introduction of this, uh, so-called evidence as irrelevant to these proceedings.
It will only unfairly prejudice against my client.
Your objection is noted, Mr. Shenker.
If this case ends in a conviction, you have the right of appeal.
You may proceed, Miss Carson.
Thank you, Your Honor.
[Paper Rustling]
Um, the next witness in this case will be a Mr. Bianco.
Your Honor, an important matter has just been brought to my attention.
It will be necessary to excuse the jury, Your Honor.
[Spectators Murmuring]
[Judge Delaporte] Bailiff, escort thejury to the waiting room.
What's this all about, Miss Carson?
Your Honor, this letter states that a juror in this case,
Juror Number Seven, has received substantial money— money which was paid to him to influence his vote.
The letter even states where the money can be found, Your Honor.
I'll see both counsel in my chambers at once.
That's not mine.
I've never seen that bag before in my life.
[Carson] Mosca planted it to get a mistrial.
I thought we were watching.
We were.
But not close enough.
I am... angered... that the security measures in this trial have been effectively breached, and I have my own theories as to how that happened, but if I let this trial go to term, an appeal is certain.
- Correct, Mr. Shenker?
- Quite certain, Your Honor.
Therefore, I have no choice... but to declare a mistrial and release thejury.
[People Whistling]
I will entertain written motions from the government to refile for a new trial, Miss Carson, whenever the calendar permits.
Uh, Your Honor, pending a decision on the part of the government as to the disposition of this case, and in view of the length of time usually required, the defense requests that the defendant be released on bail.
Yes, I'll grant that, Mr. Shenker, subject to revocation.
Bail is set at the original one million dollars.
[Woman] Can we get a statement, Mr. Mosca?
My client will say a few words outside.
You play racquetball, Crockett?
I got a court at 7:00.
Excuse me.
[Chattering]
[Woman] Did you attempt to bribe a juror, Mr. Mosca?
Did I bribe a juror?
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
I don't bribe people.
I don't bribe people.
It's against the law.
[Woman #2] Does the government have a vendetta against you, Mr. Mosca?
Well, what would you call it?
An admiration society?
That's all for now, ladies and gentlemen.
I'll have a statement for the press.
Follow me over here, please.
[Clamoring]
- Mosca!
- [Woman Screams]
- Terry—
- Stay away, Sonny.
Just stay away.
Don't do it, man.
Don't... do it.
This guy killed my father, Sonny, and he's just walkin' away.
[Crockett] Terry, if you go offbehind this, you mess it all up, man— the whole thing.
My father gave his life for this bastard, and the judge just let him walk?
Business as usual, I guess.
Huh, Sonny?
Terry—
What does it mean, man?
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
Terry.
Man, I feel the same as you, but this guy's only gonna be on the street for as long as it takes for a new trial.
Don't blow it, man.
Please don't blow it.
That's what your father did it for.
Terry, that's what it means, man.
[Gunshot]
Go ahead, Mosca.
Make it easy.
"In 1860, an armed conflict in Rio da Prata was waiting to happen.
When Don Carlos Antonio, father of the "mariscal" Solano Lopez... starts pulling Paraguay out of its political and trade isolation... to which it had been reduced by his antecessor... the self-acclaimed perpetual dictator, José Gaspar Rodriguez de Francia... international greed is reawaken... along with old frontier problems between Argentina and Brazil.
With the fragile geopolitical balance of the Prata... the Paraguayan regime's nationalist totalitarianism finds on the 1860's... support from the conservative government of Uruguay... constantly threatened by financial and economic interests from abroad... the English included, with the intervention of its neighbors.
Through non-official diplomatic and party means... especially through López' desire to validate Paraguay's voice... a mutual pact was designed with the East Band of Uruguay... just in case Brazil or Argentina decide to strike.
The sudden occupation of the South of Mato Grosso... region covered with fields and cattle, was a retaliation... to Brazil's armed intervention in Uruguay... with no official war declaration, just like López had done it."
"Truth is concrete." Hegel.
History... has the trait of looking old although it is very up-to-date.
The events of the 19th century relating to the Paraguay War... and even after that war... show us an amazing reality.
"GUERRA DO BRASIL"
"In memoriam of Maraidith Rne.
Flores"
In December 27th, 1864, in Mato Grosso... the first blast of the Paraguay War was heard.
The target was the Coimbra Fort, up the Paraguay river... the most Western frontier of Brazil.
The fort was quickly taken by Colonel Barrios and 4,500 troops... whose lack of experience sacrificed over 200 lives.
Such episode symbolizes Brazil's lack of will power for war... unlike Paraguay, which had been fighting for months.
The commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Ermenegildo Carreiro... who was inspecting the fort by coincidence... at first refused Barrios' command to surrender.
Cornered by the gunfire and the assault attempts...
Porto Carreiro leaves the fort at night, unharmed.
They had ammunition and troops to resist the attack... and reinforcements were on their way.
Attention!
Company, march!
We are marching!
Brazil!
Brazil!
Getting ready to stop!
Halt!
Left turn!
Now!
In Corumbá, panic takes over the Colonel Carlos Augusto de Oliveira.
Even though he hadn't even seen the invader... he flees to the capital with his high office and his troops.
Cuiabá, after being home for them... and submitting Carreiro to the War Council... starts to fear a Paraguayan attack, which never went beyond threats.
ONLY FOR THE FATE AND THE HONOR OF OUR ARMS...
WE WILL SURRENDER THE FORT.
When the rain was really heavy, when it came down strong... we could see all the bones.
So the kids would scavenger through them to find gold... in the teeth of the Paraguayans.
We would take it out and sell it to goldsmiths.
That was really normal, it didn't bother us at all.
Anyone who walked by could see heads with perfect teeth.
We used to find little bullets.
I think they used to insert little round bullets.
So all the kids would gather those.
If the bone was too big, the commanding officer had it cleaned... and later buried in the cemetery.
They were all buried.
There were lots and lots of them.
I believe some 800 men, just in the church grounds.
From the entrance of the church to a distance of 160 feet... all you could see was bones from the Paraguayans.
On the ground, a second group of 3,500 troops... commanded by Colonel Resquín crosses the Apa river... and takes over the South of Mato Grosso... pillaging whatever is in sight:
Cattle, guns, powder... and groceries, to send it all over to Assúncion.
At the same time in Dourados...
Captain Martin Urbieta and his 200 troops... attack the vanguard of Lieutenant Antonio João... in charge of as few as 15 men.
Feeling the enemy's presence...
Antonio João wrote to his commanding officer.
His note said:
"I know I will die.
But my blood and that of my brothers... will serve as solemn protest against the invasion of my motherland."
There is some controversy and doubt around such heroism.
Until this day, Antonio João is considered a ghost.
The pictures shown here are but fantasies.
The Army still searches for the real face of the patron... of its auxiliary officers.
He executed his words.
He honored his soldier words.
It's nothing but the unilateral desire of López... who took advantage of a series of circumstances... such as the Civil War in Uruguay... to start the War of the Triple Alliance.
The fact that it took both Argentina and Brazil a year to get ready... shows us that neither of them was instigating a war.
Brazil had to start importing battle material... training soldiers... and even freeing slaves because it did not have its own army.
When the war started, the court believed that in Rio Grande do Sul... there was a large enough army to stop the Paraguayan invasion... which happened down there.
They thought that because, every month... they'd send a certain amount of money so that the generals... could pay their soldiers.
The problem was that those generals, our forefathers... would put the money in their pockets... and the soldiers had been invented so that they could receive the money.
When the central government finds out about the scam... instead of putting those generals in jail for stealing... they hide the case and even give the generals more money... for them to buy guns and uniforms for the slaves and "voluntaries"... coming from all over Brazil.
They had to buy horses, too.
Then what happens?
The officers from Rio Grande do Sul... and some from other regions... who were used to their easy money-making methods... became the worst horse thieves in the world!
They would buy dying or dead horses... or they would fake their purchases and fake the receipts for them... in order to go to war.
New Paraguayan Army answering to López' new proclamation!
Paraguay was a happy country... despite its authoritarian government system.
It was a rich country.
It had railways, telegraph... it had gun factories... a series of things other American countries had not achieved yet.
To us and to some historians, it sounds strange... the way the combat ended up uniting Brazilians...
Argentines and Uruguayans.
According to our point of view... it should have been Argentines, Uruguayans and Paraguayans... against Brazilians.
General Bartolomeu Mitre... conducts the brave Argentine army to war.
The Argentines get deeply offended when we say... that the Brazilians led them... by the hand towards the war.
They do not like to hear that the Brazilians led them by the hand... as if they were children.
We wish they could understand... that what we mean by that is they entered the war as gullible children.
The Argentine people was totally against that war.
There were riots in many provinces against the war.
Men were forced to go to war.
Very often, they were taken to the front wearing ball and chain.
I believe such union was caused mostly by the masons.
Pedro II, the Duke of Caxias and others were all high-ranked masons.
Mitre, for example, was a rank 33, the highest in the organization.
And with the help of the Brazilians...
Venâncio Flores was included, and he was a mason also.
Therefore, it was a gathering of masons... which afterwards turned against Paraguay.
The Triple Alliance was literally surprised... by López' declaration of war... and by Mitre's position as an ally... for Pedro II, something not natural at all, obviously.
So they were all surprised by that declaration of war.
Consequently, the Triple Alliance was not the result... of a liberal conspiracy to transform Paraguay into a liberal country... or anything like that.
It was simply a war imposed by the circumstances back then.
López, who clearly had no diplomatic skills... believed he would be able to balance the power in Rio da Prata... when there was no such balance in power.
Brazil was much more powerful than Argentina and Paraguay combined.
Surprising the whole Brazilian fleet early in the morning... during their stay 9 miles South of the town of Corrientes... taking advantage of the fact that the whole crew spent the night on land... was the plan of a strategist during the preparation stage in Humaitá.
But as we can see throughout the entire war...
López was never at the front... and he commanded officials who had no training and no initiative... despite their bravery and patriotism.
On his way to Riachuelo, Captain Meza is concerned with the damage... in one of his eight ships... delaying the onset of the operation.
With his 7 trading vessels, one combat vessel... six of them having cannons... he sees himself facing 9 Brazilian steam war boats.
With the help of the coastal artillery...
Meza is able to turn the table of technical disadvantage mid-fight... considering the whole fight lasted 8 hours... and he had some Paraguayan soldiers flying their flag... on a Brazilian ship.
At the moment all the ships got stuck... and our ships started being boarded by the Paraguayans... they had difficulties maneuvering in the narrow canal... the combat was taking place.
That's when Admiral Barroso had the genius idea... of deciding to use the potential he had at hand, the Amazonas ship... investing with his own ship against the Paraguayan ships... using the bow wheel of the Amazonas as a battering ram.
By doing that, he turned the table on our favor.
Until then, we were in an inferior position... for the simple reason that it was very difficult to maneuver.
But when Barroso invested against Paraguayans ships... and sunk them... the ones left standing realized they were going... to go down also... and the whole situation was turned in our favor.
Our near-defeat was transformed into a glorious victory.
This episode had two leading roles:
One claiming he had initiate it Captain Delfim de Carvalho... and the other who was identified by witnesses... the Argentine Bernardino Gustavino.
Both of them questioned the heroism of Admiral Barroso... as to his brilliant intuition, that saved Brazil... from a naval defeat never seen before.
To stop the rumors about his nervous breakdown... reacting to the Paraguayan audacity of blocking his commanding voice... he files a law suit to prove the initiative was his.
Right after the war, there was this accusation... but Admiral Barroso addressed all the commanding officers... and the crew of the Amazonas ship... interrogating them about it and the answer was unanimous:
The initiative had come from the Admiral.
In the war records... you see all the responses from the officers.
If all of them failed to tell the truth, that's a different story.
López' quick advance to rescue Uruguay... by attacking Rio Grande do Sul and its unable defense troops... gathers a series of shameful events.
With ease, General Stigarribia arrives at Uruguaiana... thanks to the cowardice of General Canabarro... a mistaken hero from the Farroupilha Revolution.
For that, Canabarro was submitted to War Council... along with other officers.
Across the Uruguay river, the rest of Stigarribia's troops... are victims of the first bloodshed in the war.
General Flores, with 9, 000 Uruguayans... 400 former slaves included... kills 1, 700 Paraguayans... and captures over 1, 000, many of which were coldly beheaded later.
Stuck in Uruguaian...
Stigarribia allows himself to be surrounded by the allies.
Without any fight, he surrenders... along with the best trained soldiers of Paraguay.
The ceremony was witnessed by the very own Pedro II... and his Secretary of War, the Marquis of Caxias.
General Robles follows Stigarribia's steps... and remains motionless in Goya, South of Corrientes... with 16, 000 men.
López suspects his loyalty and has him executed as a traitor.
THE FALL OF URUGUAIANA
Any Paraguayan soldier killed in behalf of the country... will rise up again in Assunción.
We will execute every dead soldier... who does not report back to Assunción.
Violating every human rights in case of war... the allies share amongst themselves 1,200 war prisoners from Ataí.
Therefore, Uruguay incorporates over 500 Paraguayans into its army... under the threat of cutthroat or other punishments.
300 of them are sent to Buenos Ayres... to work as domestic employees.
The Brazilian share is sent to Rio de Janeiro... where the Paraguayans end up being sold as slaves.
The war was not triggered by England.
I'm not even sure what interests England might have had to do that... since trading could have been damaged.
Although, in the case of Argentina... the fundamental financial resources... were provided by England.
For example... the London - South American Bank... which still exists in Buenos Ayres... would deliver great amounts of money daily... to the Mitre administration... to pay for the daily expenses of the war.
At that moment, an Argentine by the name of De La Riestra... was sent by the government to London to close down a loan.
That loan came through.
Later on, another loan came through.
With that money... they bought guns, ammunition... animals, food for the animals and all that.
I believe that, without such financial support...
Argentina would not have been able to participate in the war.
Besides, when one analyses the loans Brazil has received... the dates on those loans are surprisingly similar.
The largest loans Brazil has received... from the first days of the Empire until 1865... they relate to the period immediately before the War of Paraguay.
In any way am I insinuating England triggered that war.
Especially if you think that England has always... linked its interests... to episodes more or less democratic, or falsely democratic... or even totalitarian.
Brazil was assaulted by the troops of Solano López.
The territory of Mato Grosso was invaded... and there the Paraguayans committed violent acts... which caused Brazil to stand up to the occasion... as a one-man army, and retaliate against such assault.
No matter how long it would take... but the wound had to be mended.
That's how I see the War of Paraguay... from the point of view of the Brazilian people.
As proof of that, the government had to resource to voluntaries... in order to form its troops, because we did not have... a powerful army.
The male population massively responded... and formed battalions of the Volunteers of the Motherland.
That holds proof that the War of Paraguay, in an early stage... was a war of the people here in Brazil.
Brazil barely had an army.
There was a national guard, mostly formed by older men... which controlled the power and prevented riots and all of that.
When the war started, we found ourselves with no army... so we had to form one as quick as possible.
A law was instituted, calling for volunteers... in the hopes that patriots would agree to die for Brazil in Paraguay.
The problem is that... the patriots were those older men... who did not think it was a good idea to die in far away Paraguay... when we had available a large number of black slaves... who could very well replace them.
So, what really happened was that... they would send black slaves in their place.
The slaves were taken off the fields and sent to war.
Obviously... some or other patriots agreed to go to war.
There was a lack of soldiers as the war went on.
So they would complete their ranks... going around, forcefully "recruiting" disabled men... street beggars, drunks, people who didn't even have a chance.
That's how the Brazilian army was formed... and sent to the War of Paraguay.
It's obvious that the result was pathetic.
The Volunteer of the Motherland enlist with great enthusiasm.
Recruiting on the streets of Rio de Janeiro.
That's how they hunt the Black slaves.
Soldiers going crazy to die for Brazil.
Heroic embarking of the Volunteers of the Motherland.
In a province in the countryside of Argentina, called Catamarca... a silversmith writes down a receipt to the governor.
"I received this much of patacones..."
which was our currency at the time...
"...for the iron anklets I made for the volunteers of the war."
Iron anklets.
We have letters from our generals that say:
"Our warriors walk tied to each other by the elbows."
It was not a popular war.
It had nothing to do with the people.
From Uruguaiana, the Triple Alliance army... leaving its mark across the plains of Argentina... arrives at Corrientes... after the evacuation of López' expeditionary group... who in their fruitless attacks across the borders... suffer 21, 000 casualties and take not one single prisoner.
April 15th, 1866 is a sad day for Paraguay.
65, 000 Brazilian, Argentine and Uruguayan soldiers... invade their territory, from where they only left 10 years later... leaving behind a destroyed country and an interim government.
Incapable to resist in Paso de la Patria and Itapiru...
López sets back to Estero Bellaco, near Tuiuty... and waits for the enemy.
For Paraguay, the war starts all over again.
I am checking the map to get an exact location.
The bisectrix is being formed before the shadow.
The shadow has to show 12 or 6.
It's 4 o'clock now... so the North is here, according to the bisectrix.
We have North right here.
Now, we follow the map... according to the direction we have determined.
This place here was the camp site and GQ for López... right after the allies had crossed the Paraná river... and settled in Paso de Patria and Paso Pucu.
Therefore, over there, we have...
Curupaiti, Humaitá this way... and Paso de Patria ahead of us.
Ever since Corrientes... to fight against the technological superiority of the Triple Alliance...
Paraguay decided to alternate... between conventional and guerilla techniques... using both hand strikes on land... and incursions into the Paraguay river and its branching rivers.
Hence the large number of casualties among the allies... which did not totally happen on decisive battles.
To the South, we see Tuiuty... which is that elevated piece of land over there, and also the swamps.
The importance of such elevation is the control you have over the area.
This is where we had the Estero Bellaco and the Tuiuty battles.
The first one was offensive... against the allies forces.
Then there was the Battle of Tuiuty, where the "mariscal"... in a deciding battle... tried to finally end the war... on May 24th, 1866.
This is where Marshall López commanded his army.
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
On the fields and swamps of Tuiuty...
López not only lost his only opportunity... to lead the allies to the negotiation table... but also cries over a horrible defeat... caused more by the inefficiency of his command... than by the strategic wisdom of his opponent... who goes from the invader to an immobilized defender.
López figures out a maneuver involving both flanks... a quick and unexpected one... to position himself on the back of the enemy.
But it turns out to be a fiasco.
In the ratio of 2 for 1, for 4 hours... with 250 cannons covering 3 miles of iron, lead and smoke... the Triple Alliance breaks down, morally and physically...
López' army.
It could not have ended in Tuiuty.
The battle occurred right here... and it was the bloodiest one in South America... with approximately 13,000 Paraguayan casualties... and 4,000 allies casualties.
This battle greatly influenced the shutdown of the operations.
With the arrival of the battalion of Porto Alegre... they were able to operate in Curuzu in early September.
And there was a great defeat on the part of the Triple Alliance... over at Curupaiti, on September 22nd.
10 days before the Battle of Curupaiti...
López asks to talk to Mitre, in the vain attempt to conciliate with him.
After 5 hours of conversation, without witnesses... the meeting of Taiticorã... results in nothing more than an exchange of compliments... gifts and hugs.
Mitre says he cannot step away from the Treaty of the Triple Alliance... which López cannot accept.
Therefore, the immediate truce is impracticable... and the conflict gains even more stamina.
Fire!
September 22nd, 1866.
The bloody lesson received by Argentines and Brazilians... at the Battle of Curupaiti... was the culminant point of the uncertain offensive of the allies... for the conquering of Humaitá.
At a time wisely chosen... with the ships positioned to chase away the enemy's coast guard... 20, 000 men... including the Argentines wearing elegant parade uniforms... the allies get ready to attack the trenches of Curupaiti... occupied by 5, 000 Paraguayans and 49 cannons.
The defeat accelerates the implosion of the allies high command.
Tamandaré, Polidoro, Flores, Mitre and Porto Alegre... had been already fighting for future glory... despite the array of mistakes the Triple Alliance had collected... all the way from Tuiuty.
From that point on... the War of Paraguay becomes an exclusive topic for Brazilians.
I've been to this place and stayed there for a week.
So I can attest for the nature of the terrain.
The terrain over there is really difficult.
There are little rivers... swamps at the river bank and around the river...
Without knowing the terrain... it is very dangerous for a military chief... to move a large number of troops, 30,000 men, for example... without previous knowledge of the terrain.
That's why Caxias, at the stabilization period... employed the use of balloons for terrain observation.
With those, he could have a better idea about the conditions.
With cavalry and naval landscape scans... it would not be easy to operate, after what happened in Tuiuty.
The Paraguayans show the allies their worst angle.
The episode of the retreat from Laguna... became an epic thanks to narration of one of its participants... a very young Vice-Count of Taunay.
But it had secondary importance in the whole context of the war.
In the mid-1867...
Colonel Carlos de Morais "Camisão"... who had fled from Corumbá after the invasion... commanding 1, 700, including Goicuru and Terena native indians... women and salesmen... starts his bold march into Paraguay up to Villa Concepción... with the intention of creating a North front.
Camisão wants to erase his image of cowardice... which had stained his conscience and his career.
Right after his group takes over Bela Vista... near the Laguna farm...
Paraguayan troops force him to retreat to Aquidauana river... with the loss of a third of his soldiers and volunteers.
Besides the Paraguayan attack... his group is afflicted with cholera... killing dozens of soldiers and officers... among them, the very own Camisão.
At a certain point of their escape...
Camisão is forced to leave over 100 sick soldiers behind... and ask for the forgiveness of the enemy troops.
According to Taunay... who contradicts himself on the report of a survivor... who claims having not seen one single bloodshed... the Paraguayans killed every sick Brazilian.
DID I SAVE THE TROOPS?
Caxias plans to sharpen every Brazilian sword... before the offensive in Humaitá.
While the allies do not make a decision...
Solano López enjoys himself taking pictures.
18 months later, November, 1867.
The allies are literally stuck in Tuiuty... and López goes back to that same operation scene... to try and convince Caxias to retreat back to the Paraná river.
The sudden arrival of the Paraguayans in Tuiuty... where the officers pass their time growing flowers... causes so much panic... that an entire Brazilian battalion is imprisoned... along with its commanding officer.
Among the trophies, besides cannons and flags of the ally countries...
Paraguay gets a trophy of political significance:
The battalion called "Paraguayan Legion"... formed by enemies of López regime, exiled in Buenos Ayres... and by prisoners forced to fight their own country.
That battalion is practically destroyed.
Besides the battle of Tuiuty... with its victory widely celebrated with balls and decorations...
Paraguay counts as victory many previous defeats... such as in Parecuê, Tataíba, Totrerobeja and Itaí... which were in fact military merits of the Triple Alliance.
With the fall of Humaitá... the result of a maneuver credited to Caxias... but which had been elaborated by Mitre 2 years before... once more, the war is apparently lost to López.
After 28 months of battle on the delta formed... by the rivers Paraná, Paraguay, and the Humaitá Fortress... over 70, 000 soldiers are dead... both from the Paraguay and the allies side... not to mention the thousands of cholera patients... wounded and maimed soldiers, and deserters.
We are here in Humaitá, and we can see above us... the ruins of the Humaitá's church... which bore 18 months of attacks from the ally squad.
233 cannons attacked the fortress of Humaitá.
On the water, there was the London battery... which went around the canal of the Paraguay river.
After the London battery... they had spread chains to prevent anyone from passing.
Humaitá was covering the back of Curupaiti.
Up the river, we have Villa Pilar.
Humaitá was a very important strategic spot.
In February 1868... the ironclads passed Humaitá... probably because of a flood, according to History records.
That's why the squad was able to cross.
From here, the ships went on to Assunción... where they started to attack the nations capital.
On November 10th, 1867, the "mariscal"... had crossed the Paraná river.
He had come from Paso Pucu and, when he arrived at Humaitá... he went on to the western region... and headed to Tebecuari river.
That happened in November... and the ally squad crossed in February 1868, 3 months later.
Unfortunately for us at the time, the Paraguayans... started an operation which can be considered very successful.
The operation was the retreat of López' army, by López himself... heading towards the North, leaving at Humaitá an unimportant group... which surrendered later on.
The retreat of over 12,000 López soldiers... through what now is the Argentine swamps... saved the Paraguayan troops from total defeat.
In June 11th, 1865, there was the Battle of Riachuelo.
Then the disembarking on Paso da Patria, Battle of Tuiuty in 1866... and the Crossing of Humaitá only happened in February... 1868.
Therefore, over 2 years after the Battle of Riachuelo.
Why?
Because we did not have a squad... capable of carrying out the crossing.
We had to prepare the squad.
The river was narrow... the Paraguayan fortifications were powerful... and any ship made of wood that tried passing them... would have certainly been sunk.
So Brazil decided to build an array of ships... then we ironclad them... and we also bought ships from other countries... including the ones ordered by the government of Paraguay.
Those ships, when they eventually started to operate... we were able to start our offensive against Paraguay.
Caxias started with the flanks... along the margins of Humaitá... and only then we were able to cross.
We had to wait for the right time.
The river flooded... we were able to attack from the river and sink the pillars... holding the chains together... the chains blocking the river from side to side.
When the pillars sank and the chains gave enough way... the ships crossed over them... under heavy Paraguayan fire... to the point of untying some of the ships... which later were taken by the current.
A Brazilian decoration which has caught our attention... was the one for the Crossing of Humaitá.
Only after over 6 months... bombarding, day and night... the Brazilian squad was able to cross Humaitá.
But the medal reads "The Crossing of Humaitá".
However, later on, even in Brazil... there was a lot o criticism... about the unpleasant fact that it had taken them so much time to cross.
Because of that, that decoration was removed... from the officers who had received it.
They've heard about it, but they don't know about it.
They've read about it, they've been lectured about it... just like I have been, by my father.
But I speak the truth... because my father told me everything.
Why would he lie to his son?
I know he took Corumbá back, but young people do not know that.
I was 3 years-old when he started telling me about it.
It was 1907, and I remember everything to this day.
- How was Corumbá taken back?
- This is what my father told me.
The force was formed in Cuiabá.
Their commanding officer asked them who wanted to take Corumbá back.
He said "Take a step forward".
600 men took a step forward.
Those 600 men came to take Corumbá.
My father was among them... plus two brothers of the young ladies and the young man... made prisoners by the Paraguayans.
That's what he told me.
- Was it violent or was it easy?
- He said it was violent.
It was easy, because there was not too much resistance.
- Why not?
- Because it was unexpected.
The Paraguayans were all asleep.
The commanding officers were about to have some coffee...
The two ladies were in the kitchen, saying:
"This would be a good time for the Brazilians to come".
My father was told that, and then he told it to us.
The ladies said that in a very low voice, while preparing the coffee.
As soon as they said it, they heard "Hail to the Brazilian nation!"
There was immediate fire, and the commanding officers fled.
They all fled under fire.
The priest was killed.
I don't remember if they killed the Colonel.
I can't tell you that.
But the priest was killed.
They killed him, ripped off his ribs... roasted it and ate them!
I don't know if that's true.
The salvation of Corumbá was real.
It happened on June 13th, 1867.
How long had the Paraguayans been here?
2 years and almost 6 months.
- How do you know that?
- Through History and... through some personal history.
My grandfather was a soldier and he fought in the War of Paraguay.
He used to tell us that story from beginning to end... because he participated in the salvation of Corumbá.
It was a very balanced fight.
What they say about the Paraguayans being asleep is not true.
Both sides fought in a very balanced way.
17th BATTALION OF HUNTERS BAND
The occupation of Mato Grosso... and the Paraguayans taking over Corumbá for 2 and a half years... at first appeared to have only a psychological effect.
However, along the war, its strategic value is revealed:
Protect the back part of the country... and protect López opportunity to communicate with the Pacific Ocean... through Bolivia.
The Paraguayans counted on the sympathy... of the dictator Mariano Mergarello... who promised to lend López 12, 000 Bolivian soldiers... but he never kept his word.
During the entire war, with the blockage of Rio da Prata...
López kept open his diplomatic channels with South America...
France, England and the United States... besides being able to import guns, medication and food.
On this square, there were some cannons.
This is Republic Square.
They installed them here because... there was a good view of the Paraguay river... and they could see the ships coming.
It happened during the War of Paraguay.
In the year of 1867... 200 soldiers of the Lieutenant Colonel Antônio Maria Coelho... went down the Cuiabá river aboard fragile vessels... to chase away from Corumbá... the invaders commanded by Solano López.
So few accomplishing so much for so many Brazilians.
Every little detail of it, exactly as Military History has recorded... is reenacted in a natural performance close to real facts... full of emotion.
Now, it's time for the symbolic action of taking Corumbá back.
A great epic, rich in civism, honoring the History of our country.
The rescue team in action.
This reminds us that the enemy was more powerful and calm.
The Brazilian soldiers took the enemy by surprise.
It was an overwhelming fight.
I see the rising of this idea of portraying López... as the incarnation of the National State... of a desire for Latin-American freedom... and that happens in the 30's... with the totalitarian ideas coming from contemporaneous Europe.
It happens in the days of Getúlio Vargas and Perón... who considers Rosas a nationalist.
Rosas was not a nationalist... in any sense of the word.
In 1934, it is released in Berlin a book which presents Simon Bolívar... as a proto-Fuhrer, an enlightened leader... who knows what his country wants, who represents everything... his country wants to be and must be.
It was a time when democracy, liberal values... and dissension were being set aside.
At the same time, people started to reawaken... the political image of the great leader López.
According to current classification, Solano López was a dictator.
At the same time, he was a figure... whose popularity and ability to lead the Paraguayan people... were something Homeric, fantastic.
Although he hadn't been chosen by the people in an election... he was chosen by the Paraguayan people as a leader.
On the other hand, "liberalism", as many other words... is used to hide realities that do not comply with its meaning.
If I say that I am handsome, no one is going to believe me... unless I keep saying so many times that people will believe it.
Same thing happens with liberalism.
The war happened, especially in Argentina, on behalf of liberalism.
The whole thing hides a whole array of phenomena... related to the organization of a National State of Argentina.
The organizers of such state believed that their inside enemies... would find in Paraguay a good outside ally.
They might have been right.
President Mitre's biggest fear... was that his inside enemies, with the help of Solano López... who had a significant army... would be able to frustrate the enterprise...
Mitre was putting in place at the time.
There was no freedom of speech... because of a very peculiar dictatorship instituted in 1812... by Dr. Francia.
As a counterbalance, no other country had freedom of speech... and all the countries supported the keeping of slaves.
So we cannot see the dictatorship of Dr. Francia in Paraguay... under the same light, under the same critical point of view... of what we believe freedom is today.
Even though there was no freedom in Paraguay... to express certain ideas... there was the freedom to be a free citizen... in the sense that every person had a decent life.
They had enough to eat, they never went hungry... they weren't slaves and they were free to work.
The first thing we should clarify about freedom of speech... in Brazil and in Argentina is:
Freedom of speech was limited to specific minorities.
In Paraguay, freedom of speech was non-existent... but the people didn't see that as a problem.
It was a people formed by small field workers... whose main problem was daily survival.
Their problem was not the inability to express themselves politically.
They expressed their political view... with unconditional support to López.
It had been the same way with Solano López' father.
It was a dynasty.
And, before him, with the acclaimed Francia... who had declared himself as "perpetual dictator of Paraguay".
There was no freedom of speech.
But we have to analyze that having in mind... the way society was formed.
What we would call an aristocracy, or bourgeoisie... did not exist there.
There was a small group of people in charge, the López family... including brothers, brothers-in-law and other relatives... and then there was the people, a mass of peasants.
It had to do with the rising, in Latin America... of a series of totalitarian dictators... from both the right and the left wings.
We can include in that Fidel Castro, Perón or Getúlio Vargas.
Those people seek to bring back what López meant to his people:
A great enlightened despot... a ruler who knows what his country wants.
That kind of despot attracts some enemies in England, in the U. S... in liberal capitalist countries where there is some kind of... freedom of ideas and dissension.
To justify some actions of the present... they base their ideas on those historical figures... and try to find in them some reference to values of this century.
I believe Bolívar is seen that same way.
They are always looking for a Hispanic-American hero... to justify that kind of thing... again, for completely political reasons... for a certain populism, to make sure the people will always be happy... if they are led by the hand in a patronizing way... by a great man, be that Perón, Castro or Vargas... who knows exactly where his people wants to and must go.
Paranoia or not, because of the lack of documents to prove it...
López finds out in San Fernando in 1868... that there's a conspiracy to pull him out of government... and to give the country away to the Triple Alliance.
The revolution is articulated from Assunción... by American secretary Charles Washburn... with the support of Caxias.
Brazil's gold reactivates the involvement of López family... including his own mother, Doña Juana Carrillo... whom he sends to jail and sentences to whipping.
Madame Lynch, López' lover, a beautiful and attractive woman... swooped off her feet by him in the ballrooms of Paris... has the right to remove or suggest someone to be punished or killed.
Over 1, 000 so-called "traitors" are brought to justice... including López' brothers, ministers, generals... and even Father Palacios... who were executed after a direct order from a one of his inferiors...
Father Maiz, who presides the trials.
There was a conspiracy due to the wearing out of a lost war.
There was no reason to go on with it.
López felt that way.
He was willing to stand until the last shot, and he did.
He went on with it until his life was finished... and almost until his people was finished.
López' mother, brothers, generals, they knew the war was lost.
They had to surrender and be done with it.
The alternative was a catastrophe, a holocaust.
Differences aside, that famous attack against Hitler... planned by a group of generals from the Grand State... with that bomb which did not hit the target... was the same thing, they knew it was over.
However, the dictator's self-centrism and egomania... led him to the end, to suicide.
Hitler killed himself.
López, in a certain way, also killed himself.
"As a foreigner...
I came to this restless and palpitating country... linked by love to the most illustrious of its children.
For him, I adopted this land as mine.
I made my own its nights and its legends... its eagerness to a greater power... the candid beauty of its women... the innocent rawness of its men.
I loved this land... because I loved the man who represented it... and I had children who learned the language of this land.
In the war...
I cleaned the wounds of its heroes...
I splashed myself with the blood that ran across the battlefields.
I cried with widows, with childless mothers.
We all became sisters in this unstoppable pain.
What punishment may be compared to the horrors of this war?"
During the month of December of 1868... 19, 000 Brazilians and 6, 000 Argentines and Uruguayans... fight exemplary battles in Itororó, Avaí and Lomas Valentinas... destroying the entire Paraguayan army.
The cost of these victories were the lives of a third of the ally army... leaving Osório out of combat after a shot on the jaw.
On Christmas Eve... the Triple Alliance urges the dictator to surrender.
López' response was a fantastic escape... right before the eyes of the commanding officers of the Allies.
Strategically speaking, what was the meaning of his escape... to the War of Paraguay?
It represented the destruction of the Paraguayan army... which was an underlying goal of the war itself... according to its own rules.
That is, the journey to the South, the Battle of Itororó...
The Battle of Avaí... and later on, the Battle of Lomas Valentinas... and the occupation of Angostura... represented the total destruction of the Paraguayan army.
López, by going towards the mountain range... reorganized a different army.
But his escort group was so small... it could not be considered a company.
What's the explanation for Caxias allowing López to escape?
That's exactly where History starts getting really blurry.
Personally, I do not believe in the Paraguayan version:
The Duke of Caxias was a mason... and therefore he helped López escape.
The Duke of Caxias was a man of character... extremely refined when it came to ethics.
So, I do not think he would let the enemy escape... in such an open battle, typical of a war.
Militarily speaking, how do you explain that López... with only 60, 80 men by his side... was able to escape from a 20, 000 men army?
The permeability of the terrain at the time... and our lack or knowledge of the terrain... during the Battle of Lomas Valentinas opened the path for that.
López was an experienced officer... but he was never present where battle was taking place.
He commanded from the back, which was common at the time.
With the knowledge he had of the terrain, he was able to... escape and take a small escort group with him... without the possibility of being intercepted.
That is the Brazilian version, which is accepted by historians... about this controversy in our History.
Militarily speaking, it is impossible that a victorious army... would let a group of 80 men escape.
Unless the allies were so excited about the victory... that they failed to cover the whole terrain... through which such group could have escaped.
Some say that happened due to the brotherhood of the masons... but that is not proved.
The masonry in Paraguay tried to find some document... but I assure they did not find any document to prove... that López was a mason.
Other people may believe he was, but I don't, because... he came from a eminently catholic family.
Don Carlos Antonio López had 3 brothers who were faithful priests.
The Catholic church has always been against masonry.
The occupation of Assunción was... an act of violence on the part of the victorious army.
Assunción had been evacuated... because its houses had been occupied by military.
The women who started coming back to Assunción... became toys in the hands of the occupation troops.
The Argentine army occupied Villa Occidental... which today is Villa Hayes, and the imperial army stayed in Assunción.
On January 1 st, 1869...
Caxias gives orders to occupy Assunción.
For 5 days, with the entire Brazilian contingent... and a small group of Uruguayan troops...
Assunción suffers heavy pillaging... and no mercy towards its few citizens... foreign legions, churches and cemeteries.
Officers and soldiers load private and Navy ships with tea herb... tobacco, pianos, garments, furniture... curtains, carved door frames and window frames... china and crystals... jewelry and gold.
Ironically, in La Ricoleta's cemetery... among all the violated graves and tombs... the only one never touched is the one of General Diaz, from Curupaiti.
At the age of 65... tired, sick and worn out by the two years of a conflict... which he had helped to extend...
Caxias decides to proclaim the end of the war... even though he knew López was rearticulating his army.
Such rushed act had a high price.
Back in Brazil...
Caxias is heavily criticized in the Senate and in the press... for having allowed López to escape... for giving unjustified leaves, gratifications and promotions... to his officers, and for stealing horses and mules.
About the pillaging in Assunción, Caxias and staff don't say a word.
As a replacement to Caxias... the emperor nominates his 27 year-old son-in-law... husband of Princess Isabel, the Count of Eu... to hunt down López until death.
Believing that he spotted and detained López in Piribibuí... the Count of Eu attacks 1, 600 men, women and children... who defend themselves, once they are out of ammunition... throwing stones, bottles, anything they have at hand.
During the fight, General Mirna Barreto is killed.
As revenge...
Eu demands the cutthroat of the commanding officer of Piribibuí... and of most prisoners.
To top it off, he burns down a hospital full of wounded people... after locking all the doors and all the windows.
ACOSTA ÑU MILITARY SCHOOL IN PARAGUAY
On the plains of Campo Grande, or Acosta Ñu for the Paraguayans... is where the worst combat of the entire war took place.
There, General Taballero... who commands what's left of López entourage... is completely surrounded by the Ally forces... who took 8 hours to break the resistance... of 3, 000 Paraguayans... including hundreds of boys under the age of 14.
The mythology of such combat tells that the boys... wore fake moustaches and beards... made of corn hair to look like they were veterans... when observed through binoculars.
2, 000 Paraguayans were killed... against 46 officers and soldiers of the Count of Eu.
After the combat... the count sets on fire the bushes of Acosta Ñu.
Mothers who had come to rescue their wounded sons... or bury the dead ones... get trapped inside the gigantic fire.
"So what?
When have the streets of Assunción been free of rumors?
I was still away from that city, I didn't know it yet... but my name was pronounced with disgust.
Stories about my frivolity and ambition... filled the siestas and the nights of Assunción.
Has anything changed since then?
It's been 10 years now that they are entertained by my past... by my present, and even by my future."
Madame Lynch was not exactly someone with no ambitions.
She was a very ambitious lady.
In Paris, she tried to hang out with the nobles... or at least with the bourgeoisie.
She decided to follow López because of the promise... of wealth and social status he represented.
However, in Assunción, she faces the tragedy of a society... that was small-minded, colonial and Spanish... and that rejects her for not being married to him.
Even López father, Carlos Antonio, forbids that they live together.
Priests of the Catholic church refuse to baptize their children.
Later on, they manage to do that in the countryside... but the priests of Assunción refused to do it.
She is also responsible, in a certain way... for getting access to the fortune of the López family... with the importing of the first two pianos to exist in Paraguay... which is very important to the country's cultural history.
She was very rich, due to her association with the López... who basically owned the whole country.
An American historian said once... that Paraguay was almost like the backyard of the López.
Madame Lynch was the owner of 24 of the best houses in Assunción.
She had a summer cottage, which was almost a castle... to the Paraguayan standards of the time, at Lake Ipacaraí... near San Bernardino.
During the war, López transferred to Madame Lynch... the ownership of lands that were so extensive... that they beat many European countries in size... such as the Netherlands and Belgium.
She must have been, between the years of 1865 and 1869... the most powerful land owner in the whole world.
The lands she had been given were in dispute... both with Brazil and Argentina.
The legend of... the great social celebration of the military victory... says that even the winning countries were in a very bad situation.
They had huge debts because most of the loans... that had enabled the war, had come from England.
The three countries were already in debt before the war... and after the war is over... their debts started piling up on their backs.
Paraguay was totally and absolutely destroyed... so the first thing the new government did was... getting a loan from abroad.
The symbol of the birth of the Paraguayan democracy... was a loan from abroad.
Until before that, until before 1865... there were many foreigners working in Paraguay... on the railways, in the plants... with education... but those foreign technicians were there to serve the people.
It was not that the people was working on foreign enterprises.
We're at the banks of Aquidaban.
This is where the "mariscal" Don Francisco Solano López died... the president of the Republic of Paraguay in 1870.
This is where he died, after being wounded.
He came from over there, where that landing strip is now.
He came with his horse to check in his command post.
Horse and man fell in the water, but the horse was the only one to cross.
The "mariscal" fell down right there.
He was seriously wounded, and he was helped out of the water... by Colonel Aguiar, Colonel Caminos... and Captain Arguello.
Colonel Aguiar helped him a little further.
He was sitting down, holding his saber... when he was urged to surrender.
He said:
"I will die with my country".
That's when the commanding officer of the Ally army...
General Câmara... gave order to Corporal "Devil" to finish him.
He said:
"Kill López, the tyrant".
Obviously, the corporal followed his orders and killed López.
After that, a letter was written and sent to Rio de Janeiro:
"Today, the 1 st of March, 1870... we have killed... the tyrant López with shots and knife strokes.
The soldiers wanted a souvenir of López... such as his ear, a tooth... or a lock of hair to take it back to their country... as a trophy for the War of Paraguay.
At the sight of the body of López...
Major Floriano Peixoto, who later was known as "The Iron Marshall"... does not resist and says:
"Brazil needs some leaders like this man. "
Madame Lynch, grieving over the bodies of López and her son...
Marshall Panchito, who was only 15 years-old.
Turns to the major and says:
"Is this the kind of civility you were going to bring to Paraguay?"
"The war is over.
The 'T o win or to die' cry has just silenced in the waters of Aquidaban.
My hands have buried two bodies who were loved by me.
There is nothing left to do... but covering the memories of heroes with prayers... and hope that our chest does not burst with the pain."

Welcome to the grand opening of the McDuck Bank of Duckburg, a bank so safe, if you lose your money, it's not our vault.
What makes your bank so safe, Mr. McDuck?
This - the Anti-Beagle Boy Burglar Alarm.
This alarm is so sensitive, if it hears, smells, or even glimpses a Beagle Boy...
How do you turn this thing off?
I don't like the sound of that alarm.
Me neither, Bankjob, and Ma's gonna hate it.
I don't know, Babyface.
It's kind of a catchy tune.
Za-da-da-doo-da, doo-da
Mr. McDee's bank is being robbed.
We got to stop those thieves.
My bank!
My beautiful new bank!
Look what you've done!
You nitwit!
You've crashed your last chopper on my payroll!
Nah, I'm good for a lot more.
Crashes hardly phase me.
I can out-crash anyone.
What I'm saying is, you're not working for me anymore.
You're fired!
What?
After I nearly killed myself for your grand opening?
Launchpad, it's me
- Doofus.
Launchpad, what's the matter?
I'm finished.
Wiped out.
Without Mr. McDee, my career, like my helicopter, is crashed.
But you can't quit.
You're a hero.
Everybody needs a hero sometime or other.
Look, we need a hero right here!
Yeah...
Yeah...
Yeah!
Poor little fella.
Here, kitty, kitty.
Don't be scared, little kitty.
I'll rescue you.
Come on, kitty, give me a break.
Yeow!
Aah!
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Ow!
Whew!
Glad that's over.
Yeow!
I guess rescuing cats isn't his thing.
Doofus, when will you get it through your chubby little skull that no one needs a hero nowadays?
Well, he sure does.
He's gonna jump!
Quick!
You got to save him!
Maybe we should call the police!
No time for that!
Go, hero, go!
I'll take the stairs.
We got here just in time.
Stop, buddy!
It's not worth it!
Hey, are you kidding?
I'm getting paid good money for this.
Now buzz off, buddy!
Whoa-oa-oa-oa!
Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa!
Call the police!
That little old lady just robbed the licorice store!
These business cards were a good idea, little buddy.
Thanks.
Even heroes have to advertise.
Give one to everyone you meet, and when they need a hero, they'll call you.
Here, let me give you a hand, ma'am.
Oh, thank you, sonny.
My poor old legs just aren't what they used to be.
Ha-ha... uh, what's your name, sonny?
Launchpad McQuack, ma'am.
Hero for hire.
Just give me a call.
I'll take care of it all.
Well, you boys are very sweet.
Uh, bye now.
Huh.
Must be running home to tell her friends about me.
But, Ma, you should have seen it.
If one of us sets foot in that bank, every cop in town will know it.
Yeah, that Anti-Beagle Alarm puts out some sounds, Big Mama.
Now, now, boys, didn't I raise you all to use your heads?
Yeah, sure.
Didn't I teach you to think things out, to be clever, creative?
Yeah.
Clever...
And to never give up?
Unless, of course, you're surrounded by the cops.
But, Ma, how we gonna rob a bank that's Beagle-proof?
We simply hire someone else to rob it, without him knowing he's robbing it.
Sheesh.
He'd have to be pretty stupid.
Exactly!
I don't understand it.
You gave out over 200 business cards.
And it wasn't easy.
Most people kept giving them back.
Launchpad McQuack, hero for hire.
This is Big House Studios calling.
Please hold for Mr. Spielbig.
McQuack, Spielbig here.
I produce and direct movies for Big House Productions.
Soon as I saw your business card, I said,
"That's the hero I want in my next picture."
But I don't know how to act.
I don't want acting!
I want action!
That's what sells today - stunts, chases, plenty of adventure, derring-do - like it says on your card.
Well, yeah, sure, if that's what you want.
1313 Bayside.
Right.
Who was that?
Tell you on the way.
Come on.
- Are you ready, Mr. McQuack?
- I feel a little silly.
Oh, yeah.
What did I tell you, gentlemen?
He was born to play the Webbed Wonder!
You're right, Mr. Spielbig.
He's perfect.
The perfect patsy, man.
Then it's agreed!
We start shooting first thing in the morning.
But only if the cops show up.
A-ahem!
Uh, which scene do you want to do first, Mr. Spielbig?
I feel the best way to start this movie is with... the bank scene.
- Good.
Thank you, Mr. Spielbig.
- Groovy idea.
Gosh, little buddy.
Me, a movie star!
Before you know it, this face will be seen all over the world!
Yeah.
On "wanted" posters.
Don't worry, J.Q.
My bank has been rebuilt stronger than ever!
I'll send someone to pick up your gold deposits today.
- Mrs. Featherbee?
- Yes, sir?
Get me Launchpad right away.
- You gave him the ax, remember, sir?
- Oh... yeah.
Launchpad.
I wonder what he's doing.
Ready when you are, Mr. Spielbig.
Now then, in this scene, the Webbed Wonder has just learned that the safe in this bank isn't safe.
So you've got to get all that money out of there fast.
Got it?
- Here are your lines.
- Where will the camera be?
Uh, inside the bank.
The little cameras on the walls.
We don't miss an angle.
"Never fear, the Webbed Wonder is here.
Give me all the money quick."
Ready, and... action!
Never fear!
I, uh... uh...
- Well, where's the money?
- Sorry, I forgot my lines.
Ad lib!
Make something up!
Just get the money!
Er, get the scene right.
- Take two!
- Action!
It occurred to me, boys, that there are a lot of banks in this town.
Our Webbed Wonder can take the blame for robbing all of them.
Let me try it one more time.
I know I can do it better.
No, no, you were perfect!
Perfect!
That's a wrap!
Let's get out of here!
- How'd I do?
- You were incredible.
A real hero.
Ooh, we've been robbed!
OK, now in this scene, you rob the bank.
I mean, you rescue the money from another unsafe safe.
Again?
Wouldn't it be more exciting if...?
It gets much more exciting later.
You'll love it.
Now, lights, camera... action!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
More pathos!
That's it!
And... cut!
Yeah, like before, you save the money from this unsafe bank, and...
Yeah, yeah, but this time we do it my way.
Hey, where you going?
What's that nut doing?
Depositors and savers, lend me your ears!
To keep your savings here, 'twould be a great risk.
To a safer place I take your money, and away I whisk!
"Away I whisk"?
This cat's gotta work on his lyrics.
Now, now, stop worrying, Mr. McDuck.
They'll find out who the Webbed Wonder is and arrest him.
I already know who he is, Mrs. Beakley.
That's what's got me worried.
I drove him to it.
- Well, who?
- Launchpad McQuack.
McQuack?
No!
Yes!
I can't let the police catch him.
He'll be locked up for life.
I'll just have to find him first.
That little Andy Dandy cracks me up.
Launchpad, look, your picture!
Hey, that's some publicity Big House Studios is putting out for me.
"Webbed Wonder robs ninth bank."
"Police comb Duckburg for the biggest thief since the Beagle Boys."
I'm...
I'm not a hero!
I'm a... a crook!
A fugitive!
And now my movie career is over, too.
Wait a minute.
Those movie people are the real crooks!
Yeah!
I should have suspected something when my first paycheck bounced.
All you have to do is turn those crooks in.
Come on!
No, you stay here.
I don't want you involved in this, little buddy.
I'm gonna tell the police I was just playing along with those bums to get the goods on them.
I'll be free and clear.
What if they don't believe you?
Hey, little buddy, you're forgetting what a terrific actor I am.
Morning, Officer.
Launchpad McQuack's the name.
I, uh...
Excuse me.
It's for you!
Hello?
When you didn't show up for work this morning, we got worried.
So we came over and found your chubby little friend!
I'm sorry, Launchpad.
I told them you went to the police.
Did they hurt you?
They tortured me, Launchpad!
They ate my pancakes!
Those rats.
Keep your mouth shut to the cops, McQuack!
And be at the studio in costume in ten minutes, or chubbo here is gonna be a pancake!
He's falling right into our trap!
One more phone call, and the short, dumb career of the Webbed Wonder is over.
So, what did you want to tell me?
Uh... a joke.
I know a burglar who was so successful, he quit making house calls.
Yuk-yuk!
See ya.
- "Yuk" is right.
- Hello, police?
I know where you can find that horrible Webbed Wonder person.
None of his friends have seen him for weeks.
That's him!
I'd recognize that helicopter anywhere!
Turn around, Duckworth!
Don't lose him!
Yo, little buddy?
Gosh, I've looked everywhere.
Come on out, Webbed Wonder!
You're surrounded!
Over there, Duckworth!
Stop!
Don't shoot!
He's a friend of mine!
Gee, Mr. McDee still believes in me.
But I'll never get his money back, or save Doofus, if I'm locked up for life.
Say, that's it!
Life!
You'll never take me alive!
Launchpad, what are you saying?
He's getting away!
Launchpad!
Poor Launchpad.
It's all my fault.
Boy, that automatic pilot crashes almost as good as I do.
Don't worry, Doofus, little buddy.
I won't let you down.
I'll rescue you.
I'll be your hero.
I'll...
I'll be arrested if I don't put some clothes on.
Ah, to think he was sitting here, all by his chubby little self, stuffing his chubby little face when...
Say, what's this?
He spelled something out in maple syrup.
"Beagle Buys."
Beagle Buys?
Beagle Boys!
So that's who's behind it all!
Mr. McDee's Anti-Beagle Boy Burglar Alarm will lead me right to him.
One cup flour two eggs one chainsaw.
Mm!
What's cooking, Ma?
Oh, these are for your less-fortunate brothers who are still in the slammer.
There's, um, custard crowbar pie, pumpkin pistol popovers, and my favorite - chocolate chainsaw surprise.
Ow!
No!
At last.
It's picking up something.
Knock it off, or I'll tie you all up just like little lardo here.
It's the stooge!
Launchpad...
Not a sound, fatso, or your friend gets it!
It's you!
Oh!
Well, if it isn't that nice young man who helped me across the street.
Come in.
Sit down.
Take a load off your mind!
What are you doing way out here?
Thanks.
I've been searching high and low for a friend of mine.
A roly-poly kid, about as big as this lamp here.
He was kidnapped by the Beagle Boys.
Ever heard of them?
Uh, Beagle Boys?
Oh, they sound cute.
Ooh, gracious!
How did that file get in there?
When I get my hands on those Beagles, I'm gonna...
Say, those fellas look a lot like Beagle Boys.
Doofus!
This is a huckleberry hand-grenade cake, McQuack!
Try anything funny, and I'll blow the frosting out of you!
They're getting away with our loot!
- Buckle up, boys!
- After them!
I knew you'd save me.
I knew it!
All part of being a hero, little buddy.
Well, if that will be all, Officer, I'd better go home and break the terrible news.
Whoa!
See what happens when you don't wear your seatbelts?
Surprise, Mr. McDee.
Launchpad!
You're alive!
I'm going to kill you!
You did it, Launchpad!
You are a hero!
You rescued me and got back all of Mr. McDuck's money.
You ought to hire him back again, Mr. McDuck.
Heck, he ought to give me a raise.
Thanks for not pressing charges, Mr. McDee.
I was what you call duped, you know?
Aye, nobody knows better than I what a dupe you are.
That's why you can come back to work for me.
Well, uh, what about that raise?
Of course not!
I was already paying you twice what you're worth.
All right, I'll work for half as much as before.
Not a penny less.
You got to get up pretty early in the morning to dupe this duck.
(thunder crashing)
(phonograph powers up)
(slow ragtime jazz playing)
(mechanical creaking)
(chimes tinkling)
(thunder crashes)
Trainer:
Okay, okay.
Keep that shoulder up.
Don't drop that shoulder!
Okay, like that.
Work to the body.
All right.
Hook, hook it!
Yeah, into the ribs.
Yeah.
Back up, back up.
Down, up.
Down, up.
Okay, okay, keep that shoulder up.
Well, don't drop that shoulder.
Okay, like that.
Okay.
Hook!
Get her in.
Yeah,
Work on the body, that's right, yeah.
Hook into the ribs.
All right, back up.
Back up.
Down.
Up.
Down.
Gimme a right.
Right, right, right, right.
(boxer groans)
Yeah, right, right, right, right!
You missed a spot, tough guy.
Attaboy.
What the hell
Do you think you're doing?
Aw, come on, manny.
Can I borrow these gloves?
They belonged to killer kelsey.
Th-they could bring me luck.
For what?
So you can heat up on another poor schmuck
Who's late paying off his bookie?
I did my time for that.
I don't do that stuff no more!
Come on, manny.
For old times' sake.
What the hell do you care if I use these gloves or not.
I mean, you ain't doing nothing with them.
What I'm doing with them is keeping them!
You're just like all the rest of 'em.
Nobody will give tommy dunn a break.
Man, I put those gloves
On...
I could feel it...
It was like fire.
You know?
Like my hands were burning.
I had you figured for a bum.
I didn't know you were a nutcase.
You can't throw a hook,
You got a hitch when you deliver the right,
Even your footwork is lousy.
A mile away, I can see you got nothing.
Now get out of here and do what you get paid for.
Sweep the damn floor!
(coughing)
Hey, dunn.
Why don't you give it up man?
Because I'm still hoping to get a shot at you, cornelius.
Me?
Man, I wouldn't waste my time.
(laughs) you're a lost cause, dunn.
(laughs)
Good night, mr.
King.
Ah, good night, kid.
Oh, kid, ah, before you go,
Ah, let's talk about your schedule.
Oh, yeah.
Manny:
Okay, but first... (cornelius laughs)
(laughing):
I don't believe it.
d d
Dunn.
Yeah?
I'm going home, now.
Make sure the towel money's in the box.
All of it.
I come up short again...
You're on the street.
Dunn?
Yeah, I hear ya.
Keep your nose clean.
(explosive pop)
d d
Manny.
Who's there?
Dunn Is that you?
d d
What is it, man?
You on drugs or what?
(mumbling)
This is for calling me a bum.
This is for calling me...
A nutcase.
(grunting)
This...
Is for the towel money.
(groans)
A lucky punch.
(coughing)
(moaning)
Smile.
Oh, what was that for?
(giggles)
Oh, I'm making a sort of picture diary for lloyd.
A day in the life of curious goods.
Lloyd, lloyd.
Haven't heard much of him lately.
You still engaged?
Well, of course.
Why wouldn't we be?
Well, I don't know.
If my fiancée was living with two other men.
I don't know.
Oh, yeah, well I think
Once he's seen that picture he won't be too worried.
Wait, wait, wait.
You missed my good side.
You don't have a good side.
(whistles)
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
Oh, boy, oh, boy.
Ryan:
What's up?
Do you want the good news or the bad news?
The good news, please.
Mrs. Manny king wants us to look at her husband's collection
Of boxing memorabilia.
Thinks we might be interested in buying.
She needs some cash to settle her husband's estate.
Yeah, there ought to be some stuff in there we can unload.
After all, curious goods, is curious goods.
And, uh, what's the bad news?
The reason she called us
Was that manny bought some stuff from your uncle lewis.
Like this,
Killer ken kelsey's boxing gloves,
Item 29764,
Sold to manny king.
Killer ken kelsey?
Yeah, he was a,
A welterweight boxing champ in the '40s.
In 1947, he was defending his title,
And he knocked his opponent out and...
He killed him.
Hence the nickname.
No, he had that nickname long before that.
This time he just lived up to it.
I was at that fight, that was,
That was really awful.
Kelsey hung up his gloves after that,
Some people said he went a little...
Strange.
Never threw another punch.
Well, where do we go to get this collection?
You mean, find the boxing gloves.
Manny's gym.
8th street.
Come on.
Man:
Jab, jab, jab, jab.
Jab, jab.
Stick 'em, stick 'em.
I used to box back in high school.
That explains it.
Explains what?
The brain damage.
Why don't you
Take a few pictures of these oxen.
Really put lloyd's mind at ease, hmm?
(men whistling)
No sign of those gloves yet, huh?
Nada.
(woman groans)
Oh, my manny.
He was such a packrat.
I don't know the half of what he's got.
With all the time and money he spent on this stuff,
It's got to be worth something.
And this is everything, is it?
As far as I know.
Sadie,
Do you remember a pair of old boxing gloves
Belonged to ken kelsey?
(chuckles)
Killer ken kelsey?
Sure.
They gotta be around here someplace.
You can't miss them,
They got "killer" stamped right into the leather.
All this was for a museum, you know?
Manny wanted to start one.
The history of boxing.
Well, if you don't mind my asking,
How did your husband die?
He was beaten to death in an alley right around the corner
From here.
What about the police?
The police.
What do they know from nothing?
Haven't they got
Any leads?
Oh,
Sure.
Only one set of footprints at the scene of the crime.
And they say manny tried to write something.
Two letters.
T-o.
T-o.
What could that mean?
Who knows?
Anyway, it won't bring manny back.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
So, uh, what do you think?
Well, it's going to take some time
Cataloguing all of this.
We'd like to be thorough.
Stay as long as you need.
Man:
Only one of a gorgeous guy like me?
Ooh-hoo!
I have
To wait for the flash to recharge.
For me to recharge.
(micki laughs)
So, what's your name?
I'll send you one if they turn out.
Fans call me terrific, but you can call me tony.
Forget about him, doll.
Tony here is just a boy.
Why don't you take a picture of a real man?
The name's not "doll." it's micki.
That's all right.
You're still a doll.
Hey, what say we go out for a bite to eat
After the fight tonight, just you, me and your camera?
We'll see what develops.
No, thanks.
Cornelius:
Beat it, dunn.
Hey, why don't you mind
Your own business, man, get back in the ring?
I said beat it.
You're an awful big talker
Outside of the ring, cornelius.
You want to say that to me in the ring?
(laughs) don't make me laugh, man.
The day I waste
My time with a bum like you,
I'll be hanging up my gloves.
Thanks.
Hmm.
Don't mention it.
The name's micki.
Uh...
Cornelius.
Uh, kid cornelius.
(laughs) kid cornelius?
Does everybody here have a nickname?
Well, it's all part of the image.
You know, uh... (laughs)
Looks better on the fight bills than sammy.
(laughs) look, uh,
Don't let him get to you.
Manny just lets him hang around.
He does odd jobs.
So, he's not a fighter?
Well, he's been in the ring, but, uh,
He's had more losses than anybody in the city.
And what about you?
Well, I've had a few big fights.
I could have trained uptown,
But, I decided to stay down here with manny.
Well, look, kid, I...
Sam.
Sam.
Thanks a lot.
Hey, just let me know
If he bothers you again, all right?
Okay.
Sam?
Tony, how you doing?
Hey...
Are you gonna come inside and watch me fight?
Are you kidding?
I seen you fight, if that's what you call it.
No, man, I'm gonna stay here.
You'll never know what hit you, chump.
Ha, ha.
Ha, ha.
(laughs)
What are you laughing at?
(laughing)
(dunn laughing hysterically)
(dunn coughing)
Hey, guys, leave me alone, will you?
Got to pray.
(explosive pop)
(bell dings)
(indistinct, overlapping shouting)
(overlapping shouting)
(laughs, radio plays in the background)
So, this is the great art of boxing?
(laughs)
(overlapping shouting)
(audience booing)
(overlapping crowd chatter)
(booing)
Man:
Yeah.
Yeah, that's a good one.
Man #2:
Oh, that was just lucky.
Come on.
(grunting)
(crowd shouting out)
(booing)
Man:
Get him.
Get him!
(grunting)
Man:
You hit him.
Referee:
One,
Two, three,
Four, five,
Six,
Seven, eight, nine.
(overlapping shouting)
(grunting)
(grunting)
Man:
Get him!
Get him!
(grunts)
(grunts)
(overlapping crowd chatter)
Come on, come on.
(boos from the audience)
Man:
Come on, get up!
(booing)
Referee:
One,
Two, three,
Four, five,
He's wearing the killer gloves.
Six,
Seven, eight.
Jack:
"t.O." tommy.
That's the clue manny was trying to leave.
Ten.
You're out!
Man:
Help!
Help!
I need some help.
He's dead out there.
Who's dead?
Man:
Terrific tony.
He was in an argument with dunn
Just before a fight.
And now dunn has the gloves.
Too much of a coincidence for my liking.
But dunn never left the ring.
Sure split out of here in a hurry.
Maybe he put the gloves in his locker.
Wait here.
d d
Looking for something?
Uh...
Yeah.
No.
I mean, uh, no.
You always go breaking into people's lockers?
Look, it's not what you think.
No?
Then, what is it?
Well, I gave my, uh, wallet to tommy, uh,
To hold and, uh, he said he put it in his locker.
Yeah, is that a fact?
Yeah, yeah.
And he left in such a hurry...
Mm-hmm.
...He must have forgot about it.
And what's this, then?
Ah, geez.
Thanks.
Go on.
Get out of here before you get into more trouble.
Okay, thanks.
Ryan:
Damn, he's home.
Micki:
This is exactly the type of neighborhood
Dunn would live in.
If he wasn't there, I could get us in easily enough.
We could be waiting all night for him to come out.
I've got an idea.
Hey, where are you going?
There are some things I can do that you two can't.
(line ringing)
Dunn:
Hi.
Hi.
Is this tommy dunn?
Yeah.
You might not remember me,
But I met you earlier today at the gym.
My name's micki.
The skirt with the camera.
That's right.
I just wanted to tell you
That I thought you fought a wonderful fight.
Uh, well, uh, it wasn't bad.
And I also wanted to apologize
For the way I acted this afternoon.
Yeah, well, uh, you win some, you lose some.
Well, look, um, I know it's late,
But if you're not doing anything,
I would really love to grab a cup of coffee.
Yeah?
Well, uh, why don't you come on over to my place?
Mm.
Um, I'd rather not.
At least not quite yet,
If you know what I mean.
Maybe later.
Yeah, sure, doll, whatever you say.
Uh, I was also wondering
If there's a place close to where you live.
Yeah, the olympus grill.
Corner of eighth and baylor.
Uh, how about 15 minutes?
I'll be there in five.
Five it is.
Hmm.
She wants us to wait.
d d
What an unexpected surprise.
Me, too.
Bring your camera?
Max, some java.
And apple pie for two.
Max:
Yeah, sure, tommy.
Micki.
Micki-- what is that?
You irish?
With a name
Like that, you got to be.
And that hair...
My mother's irish, my father's english.
From way back.
In fact, I have a feeling my family must have
Landed with the pilgrims.
Strong hands.
And that's not all.
Ah.
You're pretty handy with that pick.
Yeah.
It was the last thing my old friend jimmy gave me
Before he went away.
Where'd he go?
Sing sing, three to eight.
This is disgusting.
The guy grades his pizzas.
(sighs)
Dunn:
You gonna eat that?
Or are you gonna torture it for a while?
I guess I really wasn't very hungry.
What say we go back to my place
For a little bit of a nightcap?
You really pounded that guy good tonight.
I hope he wasn't hurt.
If he is, he is.
That's the breaks.
I like a man with confidence.
Confidence?
Baby, you're looking at a guy that just can't lose.
At anything.
Max, the bill.
Max:
Yo.
Can I have some more coffee?
You can have some at my place.
Like I say,
I just can't lose.
Tommy, it's really getting late.
Let's not rush into anything.
Hey, doll.
You called me, you remember?
I got to work tomorrow morning really early.
You think I'm a sucker?
No, tommy, of course not.
Honest.
I-I really wanted to talk to you.
You little tease.
Tommy, please, let go of my arm.
You're hurting me.
It's got to be around here somewhere.
(phone rings)
Hey.
Pick it up!
(phone ringing)
For god's sakes, pick it up!
(phone ringing)
(ringing continues)
You,
You guys had her set me up.
No, we wouldn't do that.
(phone ringing)
(grunting)
Okay, boy.
Now, it's just you,
And me.
(camera clicks)
That's it-- the light!
(camera clicks)
Ah!
(camera clicks)
(grunting)
(screams)
(grunting)
(panting)
Ryan:
Jack, you all right?
Jack:
Yeah, yeah, I think so.
Just a little shaky is all.
Something attacked me.
I've got to get this film developed.
Micki, get in the car!
I didn't get the gloves.
Come on, let's get out of here.
You sure it wasn't just some guy
Dressed in black?
For heaven's sake, jack,
I think I know the difference between a man dressed
In black and a shadow.
My hand went right through it.
I know what I saw.
I hope these are worth it.
I had to trade in
My only copy of green lantern #3
To get these developed
In the middle of the night.
You're too kind.
Nice building.
I don't understand-- it's not there.
Never mind, micki.
It was a good idea.
No, no, I swear!
The flash must have washed it out completely.
Sure.
Wait a minute.
Look at this.
That must have been
The time the flash didn't work.
I think I know how this goes.
Look, when dunn wears those gloves,
His shadow splits off and goes after a victim.
But what the heck is this shadow?
Well, micki, we all have a dark side
To our personalities, but we keep it under control.
In dunn's case,
His dark side is unleashed.
The gloves release a shadow that's able
To kill anyone who's a threat to dunn.
Or anyone who's trying to steal the gloves.
And if there's another fight...
In order for him to win,
There has to be another murder.
Hey, man, how are you doing?
Okay-- you like that last night, davy?
Hey, frank, how you doing?
(laughing)
Ooh.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
You know, you've been shooting your mouth off
A long time around here, corny.
It's about time somebody zipped it up for you.
Oh, yeah, and you're the man?
You know, I used to be afraid of you, man,
But no more.
Huh.
Why not you and me?
Right now, up there in that ring.
Dunn, you're a waste of breathing room.
What's the matter, man, can't take the heat?
No, man, it's the smell.
Now that he knows we're after them,
He's going to guard those gloves with his life.
I doubt he'll ever use them outside the ring.
Well, why don't we call the police then?
And tell them what,
The shadow's knocking people off?
It's just his word against ours.
All right, what, what now?
Any bright ideas?
I'm sorry, ryan, not this time.
Well, looks like the only way
We're going to be able to get the gloves
Is when he's in the ring fighting.
Ha!
Damn it!
Not much chance of that.
Damn it!
Dunn has killed manny,
And he's killed tony, and there isn't a way in hell
That you or I or anybody in this world
Is going to be able to prove it.
It's... (laughing)
(grunts)
You got your wish, man!
Tonight, here and for real-- 8:00!
Man, I'll be there.
With my gloves on.
(scoffs) you better show.
What are you doing?
Nothing, I'm just giving dunn his big chance.
You can't fight him.
Why not?
Because somebody might get hurt.
Yeah, I'm going to wipe up the floor with him.
You don't understand.
You don't understand.
Now, I know
That you guys think that dunn killed manny.
Well, so do I!
There's more to it than that.
There ain't no more to it than that, man.
Manny was like a father to me.
We're going to have to make sure that nobody gets hurt.
Killed, jack, killed.
(overlapping chatter)
Cornelius:
All right!
Kid cornelius isn't going to call the match off.
He's out for blood.
Yeah, but the question is, whose?
Remember, ryan, don't be a hero.
Just wait for your opportunity.
I better set up the sun gun.
All right.
Okeydokes.
Good luck.
Thanks.
Well, tommy.
Hmm?
You're crazy coming here alone after last night.
Maybe I am.
Maybe I know something.
What do you mean?
The gloves.
I know about them.
You know?
I saw you steal them.
I was in the back waiting for manny.
Oh, yeah, well, you know, manny give me the gloves.
Kind of my good luck.
Oh, yeah, sure he did.
Your friend, manny.
How about if I go find a cop
And let him decide, hmm?
With your record, who do you think he's going to believe?
What do you want from me?
That's better.
Let's talk about your career.
You get to keep the gloves.
I get to keep the money.
Well, 70%.
(chuckles)
We got a deal, haven't we?
Yeah, we got a deal.
Tell you what.
Wait for me outside.
Out in the parking lot.
Hmm, yeah, parking lot's fine.
No games, dunn.
I can find you anywhere.
Yeah, and I know where to find you, old man.
Tonight.
Think he bought it?
I'm afraid so.
Over there's about right, I think.
I don't like this.
Well, neither do I.
But it's the best we've got.
Dunn is a real hothead.
He's bursting with rage.
We've got to use that against him.
I know, but, I'm just worried.
Well, so is dunn.
So don't worry too much.
Look, it's an old strategy
Isn't it?
Tie a goat to a peg, wait for a lion.
Yeah, I just don't want you to be the sacrificial lamb.
Hey, dunn.
See you in the parking lot, partner.
Corner man out.
(crowd shouting)
That's the way, yeah.
That's the way.
Come on.
Yeah, yeah.
Get out there and fight.
Come on!
Micki, now!
That's it, it's gone.
(crowd booing)
What a cheap shot.
Micki, behind you!
(screaming)
No!
(glass shattering)
Hey, dunn, dunn.
I'm over here, come on!
You'd rather fight girls, would you?
Co on let's see what you've got.
Yeah, come on, (engine starting)
Let's see what you've got, if you've got anything.
(crowd cheering)
That's it, yes...
Yes!
(crowd cheering)
(cheers, whistling)
Crowd:
One, two,
Three, four,
Five...
Micki, you're a genius.
You did it!
Crowd:
...Nine, ten.
You're out!
(cheering)
You put the gloves in the vault, ryan, huh?
Yeah, yeah, while you were parking.
Good.
You know, I think it all worked out pretty well.
Oh, you do,
Do you?
I suppose this
Is some great triumph in your book?
What more do you want?
We got the gloves back.
We did what we could.
Isn't that enough?
No, it is not!
That slime killed two people,
And nothing's going to happen to him!
Micki, the guy's got a perfect alibi.
What do you want us to do?
Go up to the cops and tell them
That a shadow, uh, beat two
People to death?
Cops don't believe in magic.
(sighs, grunts)
I think what she's talking about is justice,
And what you're talking about is law.
The second oldest problem, ryan.
When your ideals outstrip the realities.
Well, what's the oldest?
(dog barking)
Ryan:
Micki, you awake?
No.
You all right?
Yeah.
It's nothing.
Hey, you want some cocoa?
It's no trouble.
Not really.
Thanks, anyway.
I'll see you in the morning.
Yeah.
Okay, uh, good night.
Good night.
Come on.
Make me cut you.
Where's my gloves?
You know where they are?
All right,
We go get 'em.
You make one sound, hmm?
And I open you up.
Micki, is that you?
(dunn groans, micki whimpers)
Hold it!
Or she gets killed right here.
Okay, I'm holding.
Get the gloves.
They're locked up.
Unlock 'em.
Now.
You want to see her bleed?
Hmm?
What are you guys...?
Oh, my!
Who else is here?
Nobody, just us.
Anything you want, but just don't hurt her.
Hurt her?
Oh...
I'll hurt her to death.
Now, you...
Move it.
The gloves.
Sure, sure.
You try something...
Making some phone calls or anything,
And your girlfriend here is going to die very slowly.
I'm not his...
Shh-shh-shh.
Okay, okay, I'm going.
Okay?
Just ease up on her.
Try it.
Come on, old man.
Hey?
You want to try and take me?
You were a lot tougher in the gym, weren't you?
Turn around.
You've got no alibi for this, dunn.
You're hurting me!
For god's sake, man!
Shut up, the both of you!
Maybe I ought
To cut you both to make you shut up, hey?
Hmm?
You think that's a good idea, hey, doll?
Hmm?
No.
(chuckles)
Jack:
Dunn!
That would be foolish.
Nobody can prove anything up till now.
You've got away with it.
You've outsmarted everybody.
But if you kill us, or you hurt us,
Then they're going to know, aren't they?
So why don't you just leave now?
And you'll be quite safe.
Because without the gloves,
I go back to being like I always been:
A nobody.
A bum, like this one here wouldn't even talk to.
Hey, doll,
Maybe I ought to slice you for that, too, huh?
Watch your pretty face
While I dig it in...
Huh?
Stringing me along like that.
Making me think you liked me.
I swear!
None of us meant to hurt you.
Don't you hand me that!
You're just like the rest of them.
Always stepping on me, keeping me down,
Keeping me from taking what should belong to me.
Dunn!
You want the gloves?
There's only one.
(grunting)
(groans)
Ryan:
Come on, get up.
(groans)
Come on.
Come on, you old man, get up!
Ryan!
Get up!
Come on.
No!
No!
(grunts)
(crying):
Jack!
Why did you do that?
!
I had, I had to do it
To save you.
I had to put on the gloves.
Come on.
Where are the gloves?
Here.
(groans)
Come on, jack.
Get up.
I didn't hit him that hard.
Jack:
Ryan.
That was, without doubt,
The stupidest thing that you've ever done!
Those, those things were cursed.
Don't you know what that means?
Ryan:
It was a calculated risk,
And it worked, hmm?
I mean, look, look, look.
I, I don't have the gloves on,
And nothing went wrong.
Jack, he's not breathing.
Oh, yeah, he's still alive.
You better call an ambulance.
(crying)
Sometimes you bring justice on yourself.
(entrance bell chimes)
Cornelius:
Hey!
Where can I put this?
Micki:
Oh, hi.
Just put it over there.
Okay.
Any news on dunn yet?
Oh, yeah, the commission doctor came around.
What'd he say?
Well, it turns out
That dunn had scar tissue all around his brain,
You know from being beat up all those times.
Turns out
My fight had nothing to do with him being hurt.
You know, I thought it'd feel
Pretty good when I beat up on him.
You know, like, uh, I'd feel like...
Like I was doing something for manny.
Manny would've never had nothing to do with anything like this.
Hey, uh...
Hey, you ever, ah, figure out why he came over here?
No.
He just came in
And started shouting and...
All of a sudden, he collapsed.
Yeah, well...
Look, uh, I got to go, uh,
Get the rest of the boxes.
I got to get going.
I'm going to be running
The gym for a while for mrs.
King.
You know, try to put something back in.
Like manny always said.
So, ryan,
Looks like you weren't responsible after all.
Maybe what happened to dunn wasn't your fault, ryan,
But for what happened to me,
I hold you entirely responsible.
(laughs)
Jack:
Someday, ryan,
When you least expect it...
(clattering)
Okay, okay.
Keep that shoulder up.
Don't drop that shoulder!
Okay, like that.
Work to the body.
All right.
Hook, hook it!
Yeah, into the ribs.
Yeah.
Back up, back up.
Down, up.
Down, up.
Okay, okay, keep that shoulder up.
Well, don't drop that shoulder.
Okay, like that.
Okay.
Hook!
Get her in.
Yeah,
Work on the body, that's right, yeah.
Hook into the ribs.
All right, back up.
Back up.
Down.
Up.
Down.
Gimme a right.
Right, right, right, right.
Yeah, right, right, right, right!
You missed a spot, tough guy.
Attaboy.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Aw, come on, Manny.
Can I borrow these gloves?
They belonged to Killer Kelsey.
Th-they could bring me luck.
For what?
So you can heat up on another poor schmuck who's late paying off his bookie?
I did my time for that.
I don't do that stuff no more!
Come on, Manny.
For old times' sake.
What the hell do you care if I use these gloves or not?
I mean, you ain't doing nothing with them.
What I'm doing with them is keeping them!
Man, I put those gloves on...
I could feel it...
It was like fire.
You know?
Like my hands were burning.
I had you figured for a bum.
I didn't know you were a nutcase.
You can't throw a hook,
You got a hitch when you deliver the right, even your footwork is lousy.
A mile away, I can see you got nothing.
Now get out of here and do what you get paid for.
Sweep the damn floor!
Hey, Dunn.
Why don't you give it up man?
Because I'm still hoping to get a shot at you, Cornelius.
Me?
Man, I wouldn't waste my time.
You're a lost cause, Dunn.
Good night, Mr. King.
Ah, good night, kid.
Oh, kid, ah, before you go, ah, let's talk about your schedule.
Oh, yeah.
Okay, but first...
I don't believe it.
d
Dunn.
Yeah?
I'm going home, now.
Make sure the towel money's in the box.
All of it.
I come up short again...
You're on the street.
Dunn?
Yeah, I hear ya.
Keep your nose clean.
d
Manny.
Who's there?
Dunn Is that you?
d
What is it, man?
You on drugs or what?
This is for calling me a bum.
This is for calling me...
A nutcase.
This...
Is for the towel money.
A lucky punch.
Smile.
Oh, what was that for?
Oh, I'm making a sort of picture diary for Lloyd.
A day in the life of Curious Goods.
Lloyd, Lloyd.
Haven't heard much of him lately.
You still engaged?
Well, of course.
Why wouldn't we be?
Well, I don't know.
If my fiancée was living with two other men.
I don't know.
Oh, yeah, well I think once he's seen that picture, he won't be too worried.
Wait, wait, wait.
You missed my good side.
You don't have a good side.
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
Oh, boy, oh, boy.
What's up?
Do you want the good news or the bad news?
The good news, please.
Mrs. Manny King wants us to look at her husband's collection of boxing memorabilia.
Thinks we might be interested in buying.
She needs some cash to settle her husband's estate.
Yeah, there ought to be some stuff in there we can unload.
After all, Curious Goods, is curious goods.
And, uh, what's the bad news?
The reason she called us was that Manny bought some stuff from your uncle Lewis.
Like this,
Killer Ken Kelsey's boxing gloves,
Item 29764, sold to Manny King.
Killer Ken Kelsey?
Yeah, he was a, a waiter weight boxing champ in the '40s.
In 1947, he was defending his title, and he knocked his opponent out and...
He killed him.
Hence the nickname.
No, he had that nickname long before that.
This time he just lived up to it.
I was at that fight, that was, that was really awful.
Kelsey hung up his gloves after that, some people said he went a little...
Strange.
Never threw another punch.
Well, where do we go to get this collection?
You mean, find the boxing gloves.
Manny's gym.
8th street.
Come on.
Jab, jab, jab, jab.
Jab, jab.
Stick 'em, stick 'em.
I used to box back in high school.
That explains it.
Explains what?
The brain damage.
Why don't you take a few pictures of these oxen?
Really put Lloyd's mind at ease, hmm?
No sign of those gloves yet, huh?
Nada.
Oh, my Manny.
He was such a packrat.
I don't know the half of what he's got.
With all the time and money he spent on this stuff, it's got to be worth something.
And this is everything, is it?
As far as I know.
Sadie, do you remember a pair of old boxing gloves, belonged to Ken Kelsey?
Killer Ken Kelsey?
Sure.
They gotta be around here someplace.
You can't miss them, they got "Killer" stamped right into the leather.
All this was for a museum, you know?
Manny wanted to start one.
The history of boxing.
Well, if you don't mind my asking, how did your husband die?
He was beaten to death in an alley right around the corner from here.
What about the police?
The police.
What do they know from nothing?
Haven't they got any leads?
Oh, sure.
Only one set of footprints at the scene of the crime.
And they say Manny tried to write something.
Two letters.
T-O.
T-O.
What could that mean?
Who knows?
Anyway, it won't bring Manny back.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
So, uh, what do you think?
Well, it's going to take some time cataloguing all of this.
We'd like to be thorough.
Stay as long as you need.
Only one of a gorgeous guy like me?
Ooh-hoo!
I have to wait for the flash to recharge.
For me to recharge.
So, what's your name?
I'll send you one if they turn out.
Fans call me Terrific, but you can call me Tony.
Forget about him, doll.
Tony here is just a boy.
Why don't you take a picture of a real man?
The name's not "doll".
It's Micki.
That's all right.
You're still a doll.
Hey, what say we go out for a bite to eat after the fight tonight, just you, me and your camera?
We'll see what develops.
No, thanks.
Beat it, Dunn.
Hey, why don't you mind your own business, man, get back in the ring?
I said beat it.
You're an awful big talker outside of the ring, Cornelius.
You want to say that to me in the ring?
Don't make me laugh, man.
The day I waste my time with a bum like you,
I'll be hanging up my gloves.
Thanks.
Hmm.
Don't mention it.
The name's Micki.
Uh...
Cornelius.
Uh, Kid Cornelius.
Kid Cornelius?
Does everybody here have a nickname?
Well, it's all part of the image.
You know, uh...
Looks better on the fight bills than Sammy.
Look, uh, don't let him get to you.
Manny just lets him hang around.
He does odd jobs.
So, he's not a fighter?
Well, he's been in the ring, but, uh, he's had more losses than anybody in the city.
And what about you?
Well, I've had a few big fights.
I could have trained uptown, but, I decided to stay down here with Manny.
Well, look, Kid, I...
Sam.
Sam.
Thanks a lot.
Hey, just let me know if he bothers you again, all right?
Okay.
Sam?
Tony, how you doing?
Hey...
Are you gonna come inside and watch me fight?
Are you kidding?
I seen you fight, if that's what you call it.
No, man, I'm gonna stay here.
You'll never know what hit you, chump.
Ha, ha.
Ha, ha.
What are you laughing at?
Hey, guys, leave me alone, will you?
Got to pray.
So, this is the great art of boxing?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's a good one.
Oh, that was just lucky.
Come on.
Get him.
Get him!
You hit him.
One,
Two, three,
Four, five,
Six,
Seven, eight, nine.
Get him!
Get him!
Come on, come on.
Come on, get up!
One,
Two, three,
Four, five...
He's wearing the killer gloves.
...Six,
Seven, eight.
"T-O" Tommy.
That's the clue Manny was trying to leave.
Ten.
You're out!
Help!
Help!
I need some help.
He's dead out there.
Who's dead?
Terrific Tony.
He was in an argument with Dunn just before a fight.
And now Dunn has the gloves.
Too much of a coincidence for my liking.
But Dunn never left the ring.
Sure split out of here in a hurry.
Maybe he put the gloves in his locker.
Wait here.
d
Looking for something?
Uh...
Yeah.
No.
I mean, uh, no.
You always go breaking into people's lockers?
Look, it's not what you think.
No?
Then, what is it?
Well, I gave my, uh, wallet to Tommy, uh, to hold and, uh, he said he put it in his locker.
Yeah, is that a fact?
Yeah, yeah.
And he left in such a hurry...
Mm-hmm.
...He must have forgot about it.
And what's this, then?
Ah, geez.
Thanks.
Go on.
Get out of here before you get into more trouble.
Okay, thanks.
Damn, he's home.
This is exactly the type of neighborhood
Dunn would live in.
If he wasn't there, I could get us in easily enough.
We could be waiting all night for him to come out.
I've got an idea.
Hey, where are you going?
There are some things I can do that you two can't.
Hi.
Hi.
Is this Tommy Dunn?
Yeah.
You might not remember me, but I met you earlier today at the gym.
My name's Micki.
The skirt with the camera.
That's right.
I just wanted to tell you that I thought you fought a wonderful fight.
Uh, well, uh, it wasn't bad.
And I also wanted to apologize for the way I acted this afternoon.
Yeah, well, uh, you win some, you lose some.
Well, look, um, I know it's late, but if you're not doing anything,
I would really love to grab a cup of coffee.
Yeah?
Well, uh, why don't you come on over to my place?
Mm.
Um, I'd rather not.
At least not quite yet, if you know what I mean.
Maybe later.
Yeah, sure, doll, whatever you say.
Uh, I was also wondering if there's a place close to where you live.
Yeah, the Olympus grill.
Corner of eighth and Baylor.
Uh, how about 15 minutes?
I'll be there in five.
Five it is.
Hmm.
She wants us to wait.
d
What an unexpected surprise.
Me, too.
Bring your camera?
Max, some java.
And apple pie for two.
Yeah, sure, Tommy.
Micki.
Micki... what is that?
You Irish?
With a name like that, you got to be.
And that hair...
My mother's Irish, my father's English.
From way back.
In fact, I have a feeling my family must have landed with the pilgrims.
Strong hands.
And that's not all.
Ah.
You're pretty handy with that pick.
Yeah.
It was the last thing my old friend Jimmy gave me before he went away.
Where'd he go?
Sing Sing, three to eight.
This is disgusting.
The guy grades his pizzas.
You gonna eat that?
Or are you gonna torture it for a while?
I guess I really wasn't very hungry.
What say we go back to my place for a little bit of a nightcap?
You really pounded that guy good tonight.
I hope he wasn't hurt.
If he is, he is.
That's the breaks.
I like a man with confidence.
Confidence?
Baby, you're looking at a guy that just can't lose.
At anything.
Max, the bill.
Yo.
Can I have some more coffee?
You can have some at my place.
Like I say,
I just can't lose.
Tommy, it's really getting late.
Let's not rush into anything.
Hey, doll.
You called me, you remember?
I got to work tomorrow morning really early.
You think I'm a sucker?
No, Tommy, of course not.
Honest.
I-I really wanted to talk to you.
You little tease.
Tommy, please, let go of my arm.
You're hurting me.
It's got to be around here somewhere.
Hey.
Pick it up!
For god's sakes, pick it up!
You, you guys had her set me up.
No, we wouldn't do that.
Okay, boy.
Now, it's just you, and me.
That's it... the light!
Ah!
Jack, you all right?
Yeah, yeah, I think so.
Just a little shaky is all.
Something attacked me.
I've got to get this film developed.
Micki, get in the car!
I didn't get the gloves.
Come on, let's get out of here.
You sure it wasn't just some guy dressed in black?
For heaven's sake, Jack,
I think I know the difference between a man dressed in black and a shadow.
My hand went right through it.
I know what I saw.
I hope these are worth it.
I had to trade in my only copy of Green Lantern #3 to get these developed in the middle of the night.
You're too kind.
Nice building.
I don't understand... it's not there.
Never mind, Micki.
It was a good idea.
No, no, I swear!
The flash must have washed it out completely.
Sure.
Wait a minute.
Look at this.
That must have been the time the flash didn't work.
I think I know how this goes.
Look, when Dunn wears those gloves, his shadow splits off and goes after a victim.
But what the heck is this shadow?
Well, Micki, we all have a dark side to our personalities, but we keep it under control.
In Dunn's case, his dark side is unleashed.
The gloves release a shadow that's able to kill anyone who's a threat to Dunn.
Or anyone who's trying to steal the gloves.
And if there's another fight...
In order for him to win, there has to be another murder.
Hey, man, how are you doing?
Okay... you like that last night, Davy?
Hey, Frank, how you doing?
Ooh.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
You know, you've been shooting your mouth off a long time around here, corny.
It's about time somebody zipped it up for you.
Oh, yeah, and you're the man?
You know, I used to be afraid of you, man, but no more.
Huh.
Why not you and me?
Right now, up there in that ring.
Dunn, you're a waste of breathing room.
What's the matter, man, can't take the heat?
No, man, it's the smell.
Now that he knows we're after them, he's going to guard those gloves with his life.
I doubt he'll ever use them outside the ring.
Well, why don't we call the police then?
And tell them what, the shadow's knocking people off?
It's just his word against ours.
All right, what, what now?
Any bright ideas?
I'm sorry, Ryan, not this time.
Well, looks like the only way we're going to be able to get the gloves is when he's in the ring fighting.
Ha!
Damn it!
Not much chance of that.
Damn it!
Dunn has killed Manny, and he's killed Tony, and there isn't a way in hell that you or I or anybody in this world is going to be able to prove it.
It's...
You got your wish, man!
Tonight, here and for real...
8:00!
Man, I'll be there.
With my gloves on.
You better show.
What are you doing?
Nothing, I'm just giving Dunn his big chance.
You can't fight him.
Why not?
Because somebody might get hurt.
Yeah, I'm going to wipe up the floor with him.
You don't understand.
You don't understand.
Now, I know that you guys think that Dunn killed Manny.
Well, so do I!
There's more to it than that.
There ain't no more to it than that, man.
Manny was like a father to me.
We're going to have to make sure that nobody gets hurt.
Killed, Jack, killed.
All right!
Kid Cornelius isn't going to call the match off.
He's out for blood.
Yeah, but the question is, whose?
Remember, Ryan, don't be a hero.
Just wait for your opportunity.
I better set up the sun gun.
All right.
Okeydokes.
Good luck.
Thanks.
Well, Tommy.
Hmm?
You're crazy coming here alone after last night.
Maybe I am.
Maybe I know something.
What do you mean?
The gloves.
I know about them.
You know?
I saw you steal them.
I was in the back waiting for Manny.
Oh, yeah, well, you know, Manny give me the gloves.
Kind of my good luck.
Oh, yeah, sure he did.
Your friend, Manny.
How about if I go find a cop and let him decide, hmm?
With your record, who do you think he's going to believe?
What do you want from me?
That's better.
Let's talk about your career.
You get to keep the gloves.
I get to keep the money.
Well, 70%.
We got a deal, haven't we?
Yeah, we got a deal.
Tell you what.
Wait for me outside.
Out in the parking lot.
Hmm, yeah, parking lot's fine.
No games, Dunn.
I can find you anywhere.
Yeah, and I know where to find you, old man.
Tonight.
Think he bought it?
I'm afraid so.
Over there's about right, I think.
I don't like this.
Well, neither do I.
But it's the best we've got.
Dunn is a real hothead.
He's bursting with rage.
We've got to use that against him.
I know, but, I'm just worried.
Well, so is Dunn.
So don't worry too much.
Look, it's an old strategy, isn't it?
Tie a goat to a peg, wait for a lion.
Yeah, I just don't want you to be the sacrificial lamb.
Hey, Dunn.
See you in the parking lot, partner.
Corner man out.
That's the way, yeah.
That's the way.
Come on.
Yeah, yeah.
Get out there and fight.
Come on!
Micki, now!
That's it, it's gone.
What a cheap shot.
Micki, behind you!
No!
Hey, Dunn, Dunn.
I'm over here, come on!
You'd rather fight girls, would you?
Come on, let's see what you've got.
Yeah, come on, let's see what you've got, if you've got anything.
That's it, yes...
Yes!
One, two,
Three, four,
Five...
Micki, you're a genius.
You did it!
...Nine, ten.
You're out!
You put the gloves in the vault, Ryan, huh?
Yeah, yeah, while you were parking.
Good.
You know, I think it all worked out pretty well.
Oh, you do, do you?
I suppose this is some great triumph in your book?
What more do you want?
We got the gloves back.
We did what we could.
Isn't that enough?
No, it is not!
That slime killed two people, and nothing's going to happen to him!
Micki, the guy's got a perfect alibi.
What do you want us to do?
Go up to the cops and tell them that a shadow, uh, beat two people to death?
Cops don't believe in magic.
I think what she's talking about is justice, and what you're talking about is law.
The second oldest problem, Ryan.
When your ideals outstrip the realities.
Well, what's the oldest?
Micki, you awake?
No.
You all right?
Yeah.
It's nothing.
Hey, you want some cocoa?
It's no trouble.
Not really.
Thanks, anyway.
I'll see you in the morning.
Yeah.
Okay, uh, good night.
Good night.
Come on.
Make me cut you.
Where's my gloves?
You know where they are?
All right, we go get 'em.
You make one sound, hmm?
And I open you up.
Micki, is that you?
Hold it!
Or she gets killed right here.
Okay, I'm holding.
Get the gloves.
They're locked up.
Unlock 'em.
Now.
You want to see her bleed?
Hmm?
What are you guys...?
Oh, my!
Who else is here?
Nobody, just us.
Anything you want, but just don't hurt her.
Hurt her?
Oh...
I'll hurt her to death.
Now, you...
Move it.
The gloves.
Sure, sure.
You try something...
Making some phone calls or anything, and your girlfriend here is going to die very slowly.
I'm not his...
Shh-shh-shh.
Okay, okay, I'm going.
Okay?
Just ease up on her.
Try it.
Come on, old man.
Hey?
You want to try and take me?
You were a lot tougher in the gym, weren't you?
Turn around.
You've got no alibi for this, Dunn.
You're hurting me!
For god's sake, man!
Shut up, the both of you!
Maybe I ought to cut you both to make you shut up, hey?
Hmm?
You think that's a good idea, hey, doll?
Hmm?
No.
Dunn!
That would be foolish.
Nobody can prove anything up till now.
You've got away with it.
You've outsmarted everybody.
But if you kill us, or you hurt us, then they're going to know, aren't they?
So why don't you just leave now?
And you'll be quite safe.
Because without the gloves,
I go back to being like I always been:
a nobody.
A bum, like this one here wouldn't even talk to.
Hey, doll, maybe I ought to slice you for that, too, huh?
Watch your pretty face while I dig it in...
Huh?
Stringing me along like that.
Making me think you liked me.
I swear!
None of us meant to hurt you.
Don't you hand me that!
You're just like the rest of them.
Always stepping on me, keeping me down, keeping me from taking what should belong to me.
Dunn!
You want the gloves?
There's only one.
Come on, get up.
Come on.
Come on, you old man, get up!
Ryan!
Get up!
Come on.
No!
No!
Jack!
Why did you do that?
!
I had, I had to do it to save you.
I had to put on the gloves.
Come on.
Where are the gloves?
Here.
Come on, Jack.
Get up.
I didn't hit him that hard.
Ryan.
That was, without doubt, the stupidest thing that you've ever done!
Those, those things were cursed.
Don't you know what that means?
It was a calculated risk, and it worked, hmm?
I mean, look, look, look.
I, I don't have the gloves on, and nothing went wrong.
Jack, he's not breathing.
Oh, yeah, he's still alive.
You better call an ambulance.
Sometimes you bring justice on yourself.
Hey!
Where can I put this?
Oh, hi.
Just put it over there.
Okay.
Any news on Dunn yet?
Oh, yeah, the commission doctor came around.
What'd he say?
Well, it turns out that Dunn had scar tissue all around his brain, you know from being beat up all those times.
Turns out my fight had nothing to do with him being hurt.
You know, I thought it'd feel pretty good when I beat up on him.
You know, like, uh, I'd feel like...
Like I was doing something for Manny.
Manny would've never had nothing to do with anything like this.
Hey, uh...
Hey, you ever, ah, figure out why he came over here?
No.
He just came in and started shouting and...
All of a sudden, he collapsed.
Yeah, well...
Look, uh, I got to go, uh, get the rest of the boxes.
I got to get going.
I'm going to be running the gym for a while for Mrs. King.
You know, try to put something back in.
Like Manny always said.
So, Ryan, looks like you weren't responsible after all.
Maybe what happened to Dunn wasn't your fault, Ryan, but for what happened to me,
I hold you entirely responsible.
Someday, Ryan, when you least expect it...
Hey, mister.
- Me?
- Yeah, you.
Come here.
Look at this.
Look at this.
Two-carat diamond solitaire.
Flawless.
You take this home to your wife, she'll think you're Rambo.
It's yours for 1,000 bucks.
I'm not really in the market for diamonds.
Oh, we're not talking diamonds here, we're talking investment.
Look at this, 2 carats.
It's worth 5-, 6,000.
For you, 800 bucks.
No, I don't think so.
One of a kind.
Custom-designed.
Look at the quality.
Look at the setting.
Look, 500, I throw in the chain.
Fourteen-carat gold.
Look at the clasp.
Hey, thanks, but no, thanks, okay?
Why, because you think it's hot?
Come on.
If it's really worth $6,000 and you're trying to sell it for $500, of course it's hot.
All right, not so loud, all right.
I can't fool you, man.
It's hot.
Hundred bucks.
- Hundred bucks?
- Hundred bucks.
Let me see it again.
Not so obvious, man.
There are people around.
- Fifty bucks.
- Fifty bucks?
What, are you nuts?
The clasp alone is worth more than that.
Take it or leave it.
All right, all right.
You leave me no choice.
You can't cheat an honest man.
Got any idea what the assignment is yet, kemosabe?
No, not yet.
Just that's it's around here somewhere.
And you're listening to 1620 on your AM dial.
Switching you live to the news scene in the 1900 block of Eastwood Boulevard where Rich Richards is standing by.
Chuck, I am standing opposite the Eastwood Arms Apartments where a major fire is now in progress that threatens to envelop an entire neighbourhood of apartment buildings and resident hotels.
That sounds like a bad one.
Police are in the process of closing off the area and the fire has already jumped to two adjoining buildings.
- Mark, turn around.
- What's up?
I just got our assignment.
When are these clowns gonna show?
I don't like sitting around with a million bucks, you know?
They'll be here.
Mr. Doyle says these guys get some primo stuff.
Be worth 50 times what's in that briefcase on the street.
Yeah, well, I just wish they'd show.
I don't like sitting around like this, waiting.
Not with this much money.
Open up, it's the police.
Yeah?
What is it, officer?
We have to tell everyone in this building that you may have to evacuate tonight.
Evacuate?
What's going on here?
Fire out of control over on Eastwood Boulevard.
That's two blocks away.
Yeah, but if that fire jumps, those two blocks are gonna go very quickly.
Gather up whatever you wanna take, just to be on the safe side, because if you have to evacuate, you'll have to move fast.
Yeah, right.
Thank you, officer.
It's about time.
Open up, please.
It's the police.
- It's the cops.
- Cops?
Let's get out of here.
Come on.
Mister, look at this.
Take a look.
Beautiful diamond solitaire.
- Two-carat diamond for the lady.
- Hey.
- I heard that story before.
- You ain't heard this one.
- It's a beautiful--
- Let's get out of here.
You look wonderful in your velour outfit, madam.
Thank you.
Hey, you jerk, you knocked me down.
Why don't you watch where you're going?
My mistake, my mistake.
Never mind about him, Bushy.
Grab the briefcase.
Let's go.
Nice guys.
You might have broke all my diamonds.
Oh, my God.
I'm rich.
I'm a millionaire.
I'm a billionaire.
- Hey, you!
- I'm dead.
But I'm gonna die rich.
Where did he go?
You go down around the block.
I'll go back the other way.
- Nothing.
- Nothing.
We'd better find him, though, or Mr. Doyle is gonna kill us.
- Excuse me, Father.
- Bless you, my son.
Hey, you!
You!
I'm sorry if we startled you.
Well, you did.
What's going on here, Father?
What do you mean?
Well, I mean, this place, it was...
It was deserted, all boarded up.
They closed this church years ago.
I know.
It's sort of a grand opening.
Oh, you're opening the place tonight?
That's right, Father.
Father?
Oh, Father.
Well, you see...
They're coming in through the side door.
I gotta hide.
The confessional is a good place.
Yeah.
Mark, why don't you open the front door?
You got it.
He's gotta be around here someplace.
Oh, hi.
Nice night, huh?
Yeah, yeah.
Well, we thought you was closed there, Father.
Well, we're open now, in case you'd like to come in and confess.
Not without an attorney, if you know what I mean.
Cute, my son.
Cute.
He's gotta be in there.
Let's go.
But that's a church.
Even if he's in there, you can't do anything in the church.
For a million bucks, Bushy, I'd push the button on a guy in Saint Peter's.
Come on, Mick.
That ain't right, not in a church.
Let's hang out here.
He's bound to come out and we nail him.
All right.
We'll wait.
But not forever.
Go around back.
See if he tries to slip out.
Okay.
Hi.
Oh, Father, hi.
- Hi, how you doing?
- Not so good, you know?
Well, you wanna talk about it?
- Could we?
- Sure, that's what this is all here for.
Oh, yeah, right.
Listen, Father, anything I say to you in here don't go no further, right?
I mean, you gotta keep it a secret.
Ain't that the way it works?
Don't you know, Father?
Oh, yeah.
Well, see, see, that's part of what I wanna tell you.
- I'm not really a priest.
- Me neither.
Oh, yeah.
And I found this briefcase.
- With a million bucks in it.
- Well, I didn't have time to count.
A million bucks?
How do you know?
Well, like I said, I'm not a priest.
You're not?
What are you?
I'm an angel.
You're an angel.
Yeah, well, Father,
I think you been hanging around the pews a little too long--
Hi.
- How'd you do that?
- I told you, I'm an angel.
Right.
I gotta get out of here.
I wouldn't do that.
You really don't wanna talk to Bushy and Mick about that money just now, do you?
Who's Bushy and Mick?
The two very large people waiting for you outside.
The ones you took the briefcase from, after they knocked you down.
Oh, my God.
I wish you wouldn't do that.
He doesn't like his name used in vain.
Who doesn't?
He doesn't.
Oh, yeah, right, him.
You see, Charley, this is one of those crossroads in life.
You've got a lot of decisions to make tonight.
Yeah, well, do you think maybe I could kind of hang out here until those two large fellows kind of split, then I'll get out of your hair?
If that's what you decide to do, it's your decision.
- Right.
- Bless me, Father--
Father, are you all right?
There's somebody--
Father, are you okay?
What do you want?
I can't hear you, Father.
- Keep your voice down, will you?
- Oh, sorry.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
You've sinned?
Well, nobody's perfect, so don't worry about it, okay?
Father, I don't understand what's going on.
Well, it's a long story.
Look, it's been nice talking to you, but I gotta split, so I'll see you around, okay?
On second thought, tell me about your sins.
- Jonathan.
- Yeah?
Guy's still hanging around out there.
Yeah, seems like he's looking for something.
Well, he's not looking for religion, you know what I mean?
That guy is with the bent-nose crowd.
I mean, you may not be able to recognise him, but...
Actually, I think he's looking for a priest or someone dressed like a priest.
He is?
What for?
I think he wants to kill him.
Maybe we better take these things off.
Don't you think it's a little sacrilegious?
So how long has it been since you've been to confession?
- Twenty hours.
- Twenty hours?
And I thought I had an exciting day.
Maybe I ought to get the other priest.
Oh, no, no, no, don't get the other priest.
I'm all yours.
So, my child, tell me about your sins.
Well, let's see.
I had angry thoughts about one of my customers.
Customers?
On Table 7.
I'm a waitress.
There were these men, they were so rude.
I asked them what they wanted, they couldn't make up their minds, so I said I'll come back when they decided.
They said they wanted soup, so I brought them soup.
They said, "I don't want the chowder, I want the minestrone."
I bring minestrone, they say they changed their mind, they want the special.
I know what you mean, I deal with those kind of mooks all the time.
- You do?
- Yeah.
- Well, I work with the public, don't I?
- But I got angry with them.
- Well, you had a right to.
- I did?
Yeah, you seem like a nice person there, and these guys are just jerking you around, giving you grief.
- What else?
- What do you mean, what else?
Well, I mean, what other sins?
I mean, that wouldn't even get you a Hail Mary.
I mean, that wouldn't even get you a hail.
So, what else you got?
Well, wait a minute, let's see.
Wait a minute, I'm thinking.
You still thinking?
Yeah.
The truth is, I don't have anything else to confess.
Well, that's okay.
Sometimes, you get a slow day.
I just came here to talk.
I don't have anyone to talk to.
Excuse me, Father.
Oh, boy, am I glad to see you.
Not half as glad as I am to see you.
I thought this church was closed.
We felt there was a need for it in the community again.
You don't know the half of it.
That fire over on Eastwood Boulevard is going like crazy.
Thousands of people are gonna be without a place to sleep tonight.
Every shelter in town is full.
Churches, gyms, schools, you name it.
- Well, what can we do?
- You can take some of them in.
They'll need a place to sleep, something to eat and people who are just willing to listen.
We'll be glad to help.
Good, we'll bus them over as soon as we're ready.
Sometimes I go to the church on 43rd Street.
And then I go to the one over on Overton.
And there's a real pretty little one on 14th and Grand.
I like to go there.
You get around, don't you?
Well, it's just so embarrassing to go to the same church.
I mean, I think I bore the priests.
Last night, the Father fell asleep on me.
I could hear him snoring.
It was just so embarrassing.
Can I ask a stupid question?
I mean, why don't you go to a social or something?
I mean, if you're lonely, why don't you meet somebody?
Well, it's just...
I get so embarrassed, tongue-tied.
I'm not a very interesting person and I'm very shy.
- Yeah, well, I think you're interesting.
- You do?
Yeah, I never met a compulsive confessor before.
Wait, wait, wait, I take that back.
There was this one kid in reform school, he'd confess to anything.
You were a chaplain in reform school?
Yeah, well, I was kind of a guest.
If you don't mind me saying so,
I mean, you ain't so different from everybody else.
I mean, everybody gets lonely.
But you gotta do something about it.
I mean, you gotta want something more than to just sit on your side of the screen, putting priests to sleep.
- I do.
I want to--
- What?
I want to love someone, share my life with someone.
Have kids, a home, bake things, have the holidays together.
Nothing very exciting maybe, but just warm.
I wanna be Mrs. Somebody and have kids.
Father, I know I could make some lucky man the best wife in the world.
And you know why?
Because I'm ready to give.
I know I'm no beauty queen, but I'm a nice person.
And there must be some man out there who's lonely too, who, you know, has the same needs and is ready to give too, who wants the same things that I want too.
I mean, don't you think?
Oh, yeah, there's a lot of people out there leading pretty empty lives.
Believe me, I know.
It's too bad they can't meet like this, you know, with a screen between them.
Yeah.
Then they could just sort of, you know, show what's in their hearts without having to put on airs.
You know, get to know what's really inside a person.
Yeah, well, what's inside you is pretty nice, miss.
Pretty damn nice.
Thank you.
I never confessed all that to a priest before.
You know, it really wasn't like confessing.
It was sort of like talking.
Yeah, well, I never had no broad talk to me like this neither.
I mean, most of the time, it's, "Honey, can you buy me a drink?"
You know what I mean?
Not really.
Well, it doesn't matter.
Well, if you do find somebody, he's gonna be a lucky man.
A very lucky man.
Goodbye, Father.
Thank you.
Don't mention it.
- Miss?
- Yes, Father?
I wonder if you could help us.
We've got a real situation on our hands here tonight.
They'll be people coming in here looking for shelter.
They've been burned out of their homes.
I wonder if you could help us.
- Doing what?
- Well, anything.
Preparing food or talking to them, just helping them get through the night.
Oh, I don't know.
I mean, I'd like to, but I'm not very good with people.
I'm kind of shy.
Please, they really need you.
I do have the day off tomorrow.
Of course I'll help.
I'll just go home and change.
I'll be right back.
Thank you very much.
These sirens are giving me the willies.
Same here.
Church or no church, we're taking it.
Oh, Jonathan, listen, I was thinking--
Relax.
Excuse me, Father.
I'm looking for a friend of mine, came in here tonight.
What do you want with him?
I got business with him.
I'm afraid you'll have to do that somewhere else.
This is a house of worship, not a place to do business.
Padre, I'm trying to be nice.
The guy stole something from me.
I gotta get it back.
- Well, what was it?
- A briefcase.
Just a briefcase, or was there something of value inside?
I mean, we really should know, in case we find it.
It's just a briefcase.
It's got a lot of sentimental value.
I am a very sentimental guy about that briefcase.
I can understand that.
Why don't you go to the police?
I don't need no cops.
I can handle this myself.
Now, I'm gonna ask you nice one more time.
- Where is he?
- Father, could you give me a hand?
I've got a truckload of blankets and food.
Blankets and food.
You betcha you, right now.
Maybe you should file a stolen report with that officer, huh?
Come on, let's get out of here.
Hey, Mr. Angel, thanks for saving my neck.
Well, they're not gone, you know.
They'll be waiting for you outside.
What are you gonna do, Charley?
I don't know.
Why don't you just give them the money back?
I ripped these guys off.
I go anywhere near them and I'm dead.
Then give the money to the police.
That officer will be back in a minute.
You're gonna tell him?
No, I'm not gonna tell him.
It doesn't work that way.
This is your decision to make, not mine.
Oh, well, if it's my decision, I'm gonna keep it.
I just gotta find a place to stash it till I can figure out how to get out of here.
Excuse me.
I don't understand you.
Why do you wanna keep it?
Why?
Because it's a million bucks, that's why.
For that kind of money, they're not gonna stop looking for you.
You'll be running your whole life.
Is it worth it?
You better believe it.
That money means that much to you?
The stuff of life's in this briefcase.
If you got it, you're somebody.
If you don't, you're nobody.
Nothing.
Just another chump scrambling for a buck.
If you got it, everybody's your friend.
If you got it, what's in this briefcase, you ain't got a care in the world.
Then why do you look so scared, Charley?
Because I ain't figured out how to get out of here, that's why.
Look, Charley, I got a busload of people coming in here tonight who've lost everything they had in this world.
If you wanna stay in here, you're gonna have to help them.
Mr. Angel, you got yourself a deal.
Oh, boy.
Hi, Mr. Doyle.
Where's my money, Bushy?
Mr. Doyle, we had a little problem.
I already heard about your problem.
Johnny the Tooth said he showed up and you guys wasn't there.
The cops came in, Mr. Doyle.
We had to split.
Yeah, well, that can happen.
But you know, I give a couple guys a million bucks to make a buy for me and they disappear.
If I was of a suspicious nature,
I might think they was trying to rip me off.
Oh, no, Mr. Doyle, we'd never do nothing like that.
Then where's my money?
Couple of my guys spot the two of you sitting out here in front of a church.
What are you gonna do, make a donation?
The money's in the church, Mr. Doyle.
There's a guy dressed like a priest.
He's got it.
He ain't going nowhere.
Well, if you know where it is and you know who's got it, why don't you get it?
I tried.
There was a cop in there.
The cop still in there?
No, but there's a priest.
A couple of them.
Two guys, big deal.
Let's go.
But, Mr. Doyle, he's a priest.
Hey, Mick, don't kid yourself.
It's either them or you.
You know what I mean.
What the hell's going on here?
Sandwiches and coffee right down in the front.
We got sandwiches, coffee.
You'll find blankets and pillows.
Just keep moving down to the front.
Sandwiches and coffee.
It'll be all right.
Sandwiches and coffee down front.
You'll find blankets, pillows.
Just keep moving down front.
Sandwiches and coffee.
Why don't you try the tuna sandwich?
They're the best.
Actually, the egg salad isn't bad either.
Sandwiches and coffee down front.
Hi.
Oh, we meet again, Father.
Hey, what are you doing here?
You didn't get burned out of your apartment?
Oh, no, I came to help.
You know, I never got your name.
Oh, Wanda.
Oh, I'm Charley.
Oh, well, pleased to meet you, Father Charley.
Sandwiches and coffee down front.
We've got coffees and sandwiches up there.
No, no, I don't drink coffee at night.
Etta says it keeps me up.
I don't know where she is.
Father, my wife.
Where's my wife?
- Was she on the bus with you?
- No, she was in the apartment.
I was at work.
I'm a watchman.
She was in the apartment.
I tried to get in there, but the whole place was on fire.
They wouldn't let me in, the firemen.
I couldn't get her out, Father.
Listen, look, maybe the firemen got her out.
Maybe she's at another shelter.
No, I saw all the people they got out.
I saw them all.
She wasn't there.
I asked them all.
They said they got everybody out, but she wasn't there.
She must be still in there.
Father, my Etta.
The fire, the flames.
And they couldn't get to her, Father.
Mommy, I wanna go home.
Ray, take Beth.
I've got the baby.
I'm not exactly empty-handed myself, okay?
Well, I've got the baby.
- Mommy, I wanna go home.
- Kids, let's quiet down, okay?
Will you just quiet down?
Beth, be quiet!
I wanna go home.
I'm sorry, honey.
Beth, I'm sorry.
I just...
Mommy and Daddy are upset too, Beth.
Mommy, I wanna go home.
Well, we don't have a home anymore.
Do you understand that?
We don't have anything.
Excuse me.
Maybe I can help.
Come here, sweetheart.
I don't want to.
I wanna go home.
Oh, it's all right, darling.
Come here.That's okay.
It's gonna be all right, I'm sure.
It's okay, honey.
That's it, just lie back.
What are you thinking about, Charley, your money?
No, I wasn't thinking about my money.
Then why don't you help?
Help?
How can I help?
Try giving a little, for once in your life.
I'm not talking about your precious money.
There's a lot more in this life than what you found in that briefcase.
Hey there.
What's going on here?
Go away.
Oh, honey, don't talk to the Father that way.
He's not my father.
She got you there.
Hey, what's wrong, sweetheart?
I lost my dolly.
Oh, you had to leave your dolly in the apartment?
Yeah.
- You wanna see something?
- No.
Well, this is something special.
This is something super special.
- What?
- Well, you gotta stop crying.
You see, I gotta have your complete attention.
But you're gonna like this, I promise you.
What?
I see a tear there.
I don't wanna see no tears when I show you this, because this is something that's gonna make you the luckiest little girl around.
When the other little girls see you with this, they're gonna wish they was you.
- They will?
- Yeah.
Do you ever play dress-up?
You ever get dressed up like you're a grown-up beautiful lady?
Sometimes.
Well, take a look at this.
- What is it?
- What is it?
This, my little darling, is a genuine 2-carat diamond solitaire.
Flawless, custom-designed, one of a kind.
- The only one like it in the world.
- It is?
Do you think a priest would lie to you?
Look at the setting, look at the quality.
You see this chain?
Fourteen-carat gold.
You see the clasp?
The clasp alone is worth 50 bucks, and you know what?
What?
Give me your hand.
It's yours.
It's your first grown-up present.
Your first real diamond.
It's mine for keeps?
Yeah, it sure is.
Long as you stop crying.
Mommy, look, I got a diamond with carats and everything.
Never met a broad yet who didn't light up for a sparkly.
Any age.
Gets them every time.
Well, I better get back to work.
How do you feel, Charley?
What do you mean?
I mean, how do you feel?
I don't know.
Well, now that you mention it, I feel weird.
- Like good weird or bad weird?
- "Weird" weird.
I mean, I don't feel bad, but it's not how I feel when I hustle somebody.
I mean, I used the same words, but--
But this time, you feel good.
Yeah, yeah.
Maybe I do.
Maybe I do feel good.
That's what's weird.
I mean, I didn't get nothing.
Oh, yes, you did, Charley.
You got that feeling.
You know, the funny thing is, the more you give like that, the more you get that feeling.
That don't make sense.
Oh, yes, it does, Charley.
Yes, it does.
Father.
I just wanna tell you how beautiful it was, what you gave that little girl.
Oh, that?
I mean, that was nothing.
I mean, that was no real diamond.
It's just brass and glass.
I wasn't talking about the pendant.
You gave her hope and a beautiful memory.
Sure, you gave her a part of yourself.
That wasn't brass and glass.
Looked like the real thing to me.
There he is.
Okay, let's go.
Good evening, Mr. Doyle.
- You talking to me?
- Yeah, that is your name, isn't it?
Grab him.
Okay, what's going on?
How do you know my name?
Oh, I know a lot about you, Mr. Doyle.
I know you're one of the biggest drug dealers in the city.
I know you came here tonight looking for a briefcase full of money.
Money to buy more drugs to sell to children.
You're no priest, are you?
No, I'm no priest.
You're in with that other phoney.
No, I just met him tonight.
My boss sent me on this assignment.
Your boss, huh?
Who is he, Jimmy the Ox?
No, no, bigger than that.
Harry the Hook?
- Bigger.
- Nobody's bigger than Harry the Hook.
Not in this town.
God is.
- What?
- God is.
My boss is God.
You hear this nut?
So your boss is God, huh?
Well, you better tell me where that briefcase is or you're gonna be joining your boss.
I'll give you three.
I wouldn't talk like that, especially in here.
One, two, three.
I got a feeling you're in big trouble.
I don't blame you.
She's asleep.
You look like you're an old hand at that.
Me?
No, I never done this before.
- That's right.
You're a priest.
- Yeah.
I wish you weren't.
I'll go get some blankets.
Better watch out, Charley.
I think she's falling in love with you.
Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention?
I have what I think is some pretty good news.
A number of the downtown hotels have volunteered to make all of their vacant rooms available to you.
All right, all right, listen.
Listen to me.
You get your belongings together because some buses are going to be arriving very shortly to take you all downtown, all right?
Well, I guess you won't be needing me around here anymore.
It was nice, Father.
Working with you and being around you, it was nice.
Wanda, listen, those buses will be getting here pretty soon.
Remember what you said to me in the confessional about you looking for someone to share your life with?
Yes, but, well--
I want that someone to be me.
- But, Father, you're a priest.
- I ain't no priest.
- What?
- I'm not a priest.
Look, Wanda, all my life,
I've been as phoney as that fake diamond I gave the kid.
But what I'm saying to you now, it ain't phoney, it ain't fake.
I want the same thing that you want.
And I want it with you.
But, Father--
Not Father, Charley.
CharleyTrappola.
Look, let's go someplace where we can talk, okay?
Martin, the buses are ready.
I prayed.
I prayed all night for my Etta.
That she'd come back to me, that she'd be all right.
Martin!
Martin!
Martin!
Martin.
Etta.
Is it--?
Oh, it's really you.
Wanda, there's no time.
These guys are after me.
That's why you gotta say yes or no now.
Because if it's yes, we'll just get on one of the buses.
I'll change out of my clothes.
They won't recognise me.
If they do, they won't do anything in front of the cop.
But if those guys are chasing you, why don't you just tell the police?
Because then I gotta tell them about the money.
Wanda, this is our meal ticket.
With this, we could be happy for the rest of our lives.
It's stolen money, Charley.
It's stolen from the bad guys.
Where'd they get it from?
Who did they steal it from?
Who cares?
I care.
Charley, I don't need a million dollars.
I don't wanna start a life running away.
That's no life at all.
Wanda, my whole life, I've been waiting for a score.
And this is it.
My whole life, I've been waiting for someone to share it with.
For one second, for one beautiful second,
I thought I found him.
Guess I was wrong.
I guess I just found brass and glass.
Wanda, with this money, it could be diamonds.
Real ones.
I don't need diamonds, Charley.
I need a home.
A nest.
With a good man to share it with who nobody's chasing.
Goodbye, Charley.
I see you made your decision, Charley.
You got your money.
Yeah, if I live long enough to spend it.
Oh, you'll live long.
Not if those guys out there have anything to say about it.
Those guys aren't out there.
They're gone.
What do you mean?
Gone where?
Well, the boss doesn't make me privy to that information.
But I can guarantee you, they're gone.
You mean, I can just walk out of here with the money?
If that's what you really want.
Yeah, sure.
You kidding?
Thanks, Mr. Angel.
I'll see you around.
Well, you did your best, you know.
Yeah.
What's wrong, Charley?
Wrong?
I got a million bucks in this case and I'm miserable, that's what's wrong.
Why?
You got what you wanted.
No, I didn't get what I wanted.
I wanted it all, the money and the girl.
What do you want with her?
With a million bucks, you can buy company.
Not like her.
She didn't even care about the money.
No, she just wanted you.
Yeah, she did, didn't she?
She cared more about me than a million bucks.
Just me, brass-and-glass Charley.
You weren't glass and brass to Wanda.
I don't even know where she lives.
I don't even know her last name.
- I do.
- You do?
You want a lift?
Yeah.
Yeah.
The fire department now reports full containment by this afternoon.
And as we said earlier, there have been no reports of fatalities.
In a related development, a Good Samaritan has stepped forward to ease the burden of an awful lot of victims.
A briefcase with $1 million has been deposited at city hall by an anonymous donor.
So the next time someone says there isn't a tooth fairy or Santa Claus or guardian angel, you just tell them to check with the mayor's office because they know better.
Oh, Charley.
Oh, Charley.
I gotta go find him.
Oh, Charley.
Charley, was that you on the news?
Yeah.
You wanna see something?
Genuine brass and glass.
One of a million.
Ain't worth two bits, unless you say yes and put it on your finger.
And then all the money in the world wouldn't buy another one like it.
Well?
Yes.
Oh, Charley.
I love you.
I love you.
Hey, Mark, Mr. Angel, thanks.
Don't mention it.
Hey, Charley, how does it feel?
Like a million bucks.
Can you believe it?
CharleyTrappola feels like a million bucks.
So long, Charley.
Give my best to the missus.
Life is like a hurricane
Here in Duckburg
Race cars, lasers, aeroplanes
It's a duck-blur
Might solve a mystery
Or rewrite history
DuckTales, ooh-ooh
Every day, they're out there making DuckTales
Ooh-ooh
Tales of derring-do, bad and good-luck tales
D-d-d-danger
Watch behind you
There's a stranger out to find you
What to do?
Just grab onto some DuckTales
Ooh-ooh
Every day, they're out there making DuckTales
Ooh-ooh
Tales of derring-do, bad and good-luck tales,
Ooh-ooh
Not ponytails or cottontails no, DuckTales,
Ooh-ooh
Oh, my gold is close.
I can just feel it.
That madman McDuck must've figured out where the Valley of the Golden Suns is by now.
And when he does, I'll let him lead me to the treasure, and then - wham!
Because I, El Capitan, deserve every bit of it!
Calm down, Uncle Scrooge.
We'll be at the Quackawacka River in no time.
We'd better be.
After all the trouble I've gone through,
I, Scrooge McDuck, deserve this treasure.
Wow, I've never seen him like this before.
I'm afraid, children, that Mr. McDuck is in the clutches of gold fever.
Gold fever?
What's that?
It's when you itch for wealth so much, you forget what's important.
Well, Launchpad?
According to this, we land just past those falls.
Then speed it up.
I want that gold.
Aah!
It's stuck.
Hey, got it.
No!
- Uncle Scrooge, what happened?
- Oh, Launchpad's seat broke, that's all.
Hah, seat broke my tailfin.
We're caught in the current!
Looks like your runway is running away with us.
- Let's get back into the sky.
- Don't worry.
When the going gets tough, the harder they fall.
- Where's our takeoff, McQuack?
- It'll take a minute to restart the engines.
We haven't got a minute.
Look.
Uh-oh.
- Get this plane off the ground!
- It's a no-go, Mr. McD.
And if we can't go up, then we'll just go down.
Oh, the plane's sinking.
Are you sure you and the children want to come along, Beakley?
Yes.
An archeological discovery will be very educational and drier.
OK, Launchpad, get this plane floating again.
And when I shoot a flair up, you come runnin'.
I'll get there lickety-toot.
Don't just sit there.
Paddle.
My treasure's upstream.
Aye, aye, Captain Greed.
Stroke, stroke.
Faster!
Stroke.
Drat, I don't have time for detours.
Chew on this, fish breath.
That ought to hold that reject from a luggage factory.
But what about him?
And him?
And him?
I don't think we have enough paddles, Uncle Scrooge.
This is all your fault, Mr. McDuck.
You've got to do something.
You're right, Beakley.
I am going to do something.
Mr. McDuck, wait.
Don't!
- Wow, some ride, Uncle Scrooge.
- I'm sorry I doubted you, Mr. McDuck.
Forget that.
Let's just find my gold.
Uncle Scrooge, looky here.
An ancient pathway.
It heads right for the valley.
Well, what are we waiting for?
Yes, amigo.
What are we waiting for?
Hey, Dewey, does this road seem strange to you?
Yeah, not a burger place in sight.
No.
I mean, if this valley is supposed to be a secret, then why build a road to it?
- Right, unless it's...
- A trap!
Uncle Scrooge, wait!
Look out!
Uh, I knew those were there all along.
Sure, Uncle Scrooge.
Now all I gotta do is anchor this baby to the shore, shut the doors and pump the water out of her.
Heh-heh.
Voy-là, instant transportation.
Suddenly I have this craving for a large cup of coffee.
Gee, an escalator.
No, dear.
This is an older model.
We have to walk up these.
And the sooner we get up them, the sooner we find the Valley of the Golden Suns.
Come on.
236, 237, 238.
Mrs. Beakley, how come Uncle Scrooge has that funny twitch?
It's the next symptom of gold fever, Dewey.
We must be getting very close to the treasure.
Oh, great, a dead end.
No.
I've come too far to quit now.
Ah, a gap.
Hand me that tree limb, boys.
OK, pull.
Pull!
- Ow, my eyes!
- Oh, what's that?
Follow me.
Ooh, I don't like this.
Row, row, row your hut gently cross the stream
Merrily, merrily, merrily...
Yaah, a snake!
I hate snakes!
No, that's somebody else.
I sorta like snakes.
Hey!
Now I know how a worm feels.
Behold, the golden suns.
This is it.
I found the treasure.
Those giant disks go all around the valley.
Wow, they must weigh a ton each.
Hoo-hoo, judging by their size, I'd say 2.3 tons each.
Why, that's more gold than I've ever seen.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
That's more gold than in Fort Knox.
And it's all mine.
Look, Uncle Scrooge, there's one right below us.
It looks just like your sun coin, Uncle Scrooge.
Better than that.
It's made of the same stuff.
Pure gold!
- Uncle Scrooge, what are you doing?
- Help me shake this beauty loose.
Is he nuts?
We'll never be able to carry this back.
The gold fever is getting worse.
Perhaps we'd better...
- Hang on!
- Help!
I've heard of money taking you places, but this is ridiculous.
- Big hill, dead ahead.
- Prepare to abandon disk.
- I'm not going.
- But we're gonna crash!
- No, it's mine.
- Ducks away!
Bong?
It can't be.
It just can't be!
- Is it the gold fever, Grammy?
- Yes, Webby.
He's getting worse.
Pluck my tail feathers and call me Baldy.
Those disks are loose change compared to this.
- What is it, Uncle Scrooge?
- It's gold.
An entire building of gold.
Then this must be what we've been looking for.
Right.
Now help me find a door to this place.
If I melted this down,
I could remake the Statue of Liberty out of solid gold.
One for every day of the week.
Uh, shouldn't we signal Launchpad, Mr. McDuck?
Oh, yeah, good idea, Beakley.
There's no way that idiot can miss that.
Help!
Yeow-ow-ow!
Now I hate snakes.
Ahh, I didn't think there was this much gold in the whole world.
I didn't think there was this much gold in the whole universe.
This has got to be the treasure, right, Uncle Scrooge?
Uncle Scrooge?
Are you all right, Uncle Scrooge?
Am I all right?
Am I all right?
Look around, my little doubloon.
I'm in 24-karat paradise.
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!
Let's see what else we can find in McDuck's new piggy bank.
- Wow, what happened to these guys?
- It was gold fever.
And you better be careful, Mr. McDuck, or you could end up like them.
Gold... fever?
Me?
Bah!
I don't have time for ghost stories.
What do you think this well is for?
It's nothing but a heating duct or something.
We're wasting time.
Come on, lads.
Wanna see what's behind those three doors in the courtyard?
Yeah!
- Gangway!
- Me first.
What'll we do, Grammy?
The gold fever's spreading.
Yes, dear.
That's why we must keep our heads.
Grammy, look at this.
It looks like a warning, Webbigail.
We better translate it.
OK.
I'll check the Junior Woodchuck Guidebook.
Ahh, gold... dust.
Enough for my own beach.
Enough for our own desert.
More, more.
I want to see more!
Yeah, more gold.
Wait up!
I knew these were my kind of people.
Uncle Scrooge, it's just like your money bin back home.
What are we waiting for?
Ugh!
How does he do that?
All I can make out is something about greed and opening all doors and destruction.
That's it. "If you are too greedy and open all the doors at once..."
It's another trap!
- Mr. McDuck!
- Uncle Scrooge!
Come on, boys.
This is the last one.
- Stop!
- It's a trap!
Ooh-hoo, I can build a new money bin out of solid-gold... bricks.
Ooh, look at the pretty goldfinches.
Uhh...
Come on, Mr. McDuck.
We have to climb out of here.
None of you will be climbing anywhere.
Ever!
At long last, the gold...
is mine.
It's that old man who hired the Beagle Boys.
And tried to steal our ancient treasure ship.
But you drowned, didn't you?
Hah!
Nothing on Earth could stop El Capitan from finding his gold!
I've waited 400 years for this.
400 years?
You're mad.
Mad?
Heh-heh-heh.
Of course I'm mad!
I'm mad for gold!
But how did you stay alive for all these years?
Sheer willpower, niño.
Now you have a date with the lava pit, and I with my gold!
Ah, it's freezing!
But it's gotta be 150 degrees down here.
It's the final symptom of the gold fever.
That's odd, I smell gold.
- Aah!
- Uncle Scrooge, are you all right?
Better than all right.
Look.
A lake of molten gold!
And we're all about to be boiled in it.
This is the real Treasure of the Golden Suns.
What was that?
There's more gold...
down here than in all the world.
No!
It's my gold.
Mine, mine, mine!
Out!
I won't have you tainting a single drop of my gold.
- No.
- Uncle Scrooge!
I found the missing maps, I tracked this valley down.
This gold... is mine.
You are wrong, señor.
This says the gold... is mine.
- You want gold?
Here!
- Aah!
What's going on?
!
Stop this craziness.
The floor is collapsing!
- Uh-oh.
- Truce?
Truce.
Hurry up, Uncle Scrooge!
Jump!
What?
Stop them, Grammy.
They'll fall.
Mr. McDuck, the walls are moving!
Leave me alone.
Can't ya see the greatest fortune in the world's at stake?
What's better, being a rich duck or a dead duck?
A dead duck?
Quackawacka, you're right.
We'll settle this once and for all.
- Unh!
- You aren't settling anything, buster!
We can climb out on these.
Whew, what a sweat.
Sweat?
No more shivers.
I'm cured of the gold fever.
Mine, all mine!
Mine!
- What will we do about the wheezer?
- He looks happy.
Look at all the pretty gold!
No, we've got to save him.
My gold.
Leave me with my gold.
- Signal Launchpad again.
- No more flares.
We're stuck.
Hey, Mr. McD's rescue flare.
Time to pick him up.
Warp drive, Scotty.
Can't still be flooded.
I dried it.
Look, the wall's getting shorter.
No.
The temple's melting.
We're sinking.
Nice engine, nice engine.
Ooh, it's getting so hot.
There, there, dear.
It'll be all right.
Aw, silly me.
I had the choke on.
Heh-heh-heh.
Well, Mrs. Beakley, I'm sorry to have gotten you and the kids into this mess.
That's all right, Mr. McDuck.
You couldn't help yourself.
No, but thank goodness you could.
Goodbye, Beakley.
Launchpad!
- Time to go, señor.
- Never!
I'll never leave my gold... again.
Can't maintain altitude, Mr. McD!
- We made it!
- Hooray!
Wait, stop him!
My gold!
My gold!
We've got to stop him.
No!
What?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
The gold is buried under a mountain of dirt.
Fool.
I will dig up the gold if it's the last thing I do.
- But won't he dig it all up?
- Maybe, in another 400 years.
But, meanwhile, I've got more important things to look after.
- Welcome back, Uncle Scrooge.
- Right!
Still, I wish I'd been able to carry something away from that valley.
- Oh, my!
- Gold!
Mother McDuck!
No wonder the plane flew heavy.
She was covered in gold like a dipped ice-cream cone.
Heh-heh-heh.
And it's all mine.
So, Mr. McD, where's our next treasure hunt gonna be?
Aw, don't even try to tempt me, Launchpad.
There will never be another prize this big again.
I heard there were gold doubloons off the coast of Java.
I told you, I'm through with treasure hunts.
Did you say gold?
Uh-oh, here we go again.
Life is like a hurricane
Here in Duckburg
Racecars, lasers, aeroplanes
It's a duck-blur

DuckTales, ooh-ooh
Every day they're out there making DuckTales

Not ponytails or cottontails no, DuckTales
Ooh-ooh
You know what I like most about gold?
I have a lot of it!
Ha-ha!
What makes gold so valuable, Uncle Scrooge?
It's very rare.
I can sell a wee bit of gold for a great deal of money.
And, ha-ha-ha, I can play a mean game of checkers with it, too.
- What happened?
- What was that?
There is one disadvantage to gold.
It's very, very heavy.
We can't get to it.
If it reaches the forest, it'll be a disaster.
Here he comes again!
Scrooge McDuck calling Launchpad McQuack.
Come in, Launchpad.
Come in.
Hi, Mr. McDee.
What's up?
Besides me, that is.
My gold train has been trapped by a rock slide about 100 miles outside of Duckburg.
Get here as fast as you can!
On my way, Mr. McDee, as soon as I drop off something for the Forest Service.
Can't see.
I don't know where I'm going.
Well, that's never bothered me before.
Aah!
He did it!
That Launchpad McQuack must be the best pilot in the world.
Hey, here he comes!
He's in his stupid old biplane.
Launchpad, there's no place to land that thing here!
Doesn't matter, Mr. McDee.
I'm out of gas anyway.
Yeah, there's always a place to land.
- Whew!
Well, that's a start.
- It didn't move an inch.
Listen.
What's that?
I was out testing my latest invention when I heard your call for help, Mr. McDuck.
And a fine-looking helicopter it is, Gyro.
Oh, this helicopter isn't my latest invention.
- The pilot is.
- Gee, a real live robot!
Wow, he's fantastic!
He sure is.
Watch this.
Armstrong, clear the tracks.
I will clear the tracks.
It would have taken you the rest of your life to move those rocks.
Maybe longer.
Is there anything your robot can't do?
Armstrong can do anything you ask him to do, Mr. McDuck.
Oh, excuse me, sir.
I thought you were in the library.
Wait, your vacuuming would be an interesting test of Armstrong's abilities.
Uh, if you think it's, uh, ahem, proper, sir.
I certainly do.
- Go ahead, Armstrong.
Vacuum.
- I will vacuum.
Well, if I'm not needed, sir, I think I'll retire.
No need for extremes, Duckworth.
I'm sure we can find something for you to do around here.
Wow, look at him go!
That job usually takes Duckworth all day.
Wow, he opened the automatic garage door just by looking at it!
Uncle Scrooge was right.
Armstrong can do anything.
Come on, I have an idea.
Armstrong, clean up our room!
I will clean your room.
Hey, I thought you said you were go... gonna clean our...
Gosh!
We can't even mess it up that fast!
Now that's what I call fast food.
Robots might be all right for housework, but some jobs take courage, derring-do, a sense of adventure.
Well, Armstrong is an excellent pilot.
Oh, I could out-fly him any day.
Say, that's a good idea, Launchpad!
A flying contest between you and Armstrong.
Man against machine.
Ooh, ooh, I like it!
We'll make it a big event.
We'll invite the press - and potential buyers.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the first-ever air race between and robot and human pilot.
The human, in case you couldn't tell is world-famous pilot, adventurer, and derring-doer, Launchpad McQuack!
His opponent, soon to be available from McDuck Industries - batteries not included - Armstrong the Robot!
Ready?
Get set... go!
Aha!
So a robot can make mistakes.
All right, fuse box brain, let's see how you handle the old over-and-under.
Whoa-oh, whoa, whoa!
What could have happened to him?
The possibilities are infinite.
Nevertheless, it's nearly dinner time, and you have homework to do.
The search parties are doing everything possible.
- Yeah, we might as well go.
- Yeah.
Mr. McQuack.
We were all quite worried about you.
I'm afraid you've missed dinner.
I wish I'd have missed that billboard.
Mr. McDuck is in his study, and the boys are in their room.
Better let them know you're all right.
If I work around the clock, we can begin mass production in a few weeks.
- Good, good!
- Hi, Mr. McDee.
- Sorry I let you down.
- Nonsense, my boy.
We've got dozens of orders for Armstrong robots.
Why, that race showed the world what Armstrong can do.
He couldn't have done it without you.
You deserve a little vacation.
Make it a big vacation.
Now, where were we?
Wow!
It must be great to have a computer for a brain!
You did all our homework in five minutes!
You're the best friend a kid could ever have.
Yeah!
He's great!
I am Armstrong.
I am your friend.
I got ya!
Tuck-in time, boys.
- Oh, boy!
- Hey, great!
Hi, Uncle Scrooge!
Armstrong, take care of it, will you?
Tuck-in time, boys.
Eh-eh.
Make sure they brush their teeth before you tuck them in.
They will brush their teeth.
Hey, what is this?
There's only one marshmallow in my hot chocolate.
Mine too!
It's Armstrong's idea.
He's found dozens of ways to run the mansion more efficiently.
But one marshmallow!
Uncle Scrooge, come on!
Now, now, boys.
Armstrong knows what he's doing.
In fact, I'm going to see what he can do for my business first thing in the morning.
Good night, Mr. McDuck.
Good morning, Mr. McDuck.
Before you begin work, I have a little announcement to make.
Huh?
Oh.
Must be way past closing time.
Wonder how much one day of Armstrong's help has improved my profits.
I'm being robbed!
Aha, Armstrong.
Working late.
Good, but how did you get the combination to my vault?
Simple computation of multiple variables.
Well, I guess there's nothing you can't do.
But I prefer to count my money myself.
Wha...!
What are you doing?
Counting money.
Counting my money.
Now, now, Armstrong Gyro wouldn't like this.
I don't like this either.
Aah!
Trapped!
I am Armstrong.
I am your friend.
- Oh, Gyro?
- Hi, Mr. McDuck!
Why, Mr. McDuck, is something wrong?
Why, what ever gave you that idea?
He's linked up with communication satellites and electric power stations.
He operates anything powered by electricity using his own remote control.
No tin-plated battery-operated dictator is going to stop me!
Nothing can stop him!
Where's Uncle Scrooge?
He's always the first at breakfast.
Most unusual.
He didn't sleep in his bed last night.
It's not like him not to call.
Let's ask Armstrong to find him!
The robot isn't here, either.
Ah, they both must be at Gyro's.
Hello, Gyro, is Uncle Scrooge there?
No, and I don't expect to see him.
I have work to do.
Now leave me alone and don't come over here!
Meddlers!
If I was human, I might find this amusing.
I knew they would give me trouble.
I will give them trouble.
But Gyro would never talk to one of us like that!
You're right.
We better get over there.
What's wrong with that thing?
- If we timed it just right...
- We could go in the window.
They will fail.
Hey, look out!
They're running by themselves!
Somebody's doing it by remote control.
Hey, what are we afraid of?
They're only toys!
Yeah, you're right.
Ha-ha.
That should slow 'em down.
Who do you think is behind it?
Who do you know who has remote control powers?
You know, like flying model airplanes and opening automatic garage doors.
Armstrong!
And he said he was our friend!
Come on!
When did Gyro install these fences and cameras?
Oh, no!
It is useless to resist.
Look what he did to our bikes!
Now you've really made me mad!
Aah!
Let's get out of here!
We need help!
Yeah, but who'd be crazy enough to face that robot?
Launchpad!
Launchpad!
Hey, little buddies.
- Launchpad...
- Where you going?
Going away for a while - to think.
You can't do that!
Armstrong's gone haywire!
You have to help us!
We think he's holding Gyro and Uncle Scrooge captive!
So, the metal miracle got his wires crossed, eh?
They're at Gyro's barn!
He's built electric fences all around it.
Complete with laser beams!
We'll have to fly in, but I'm afraid my chopper is a wreck.
Just as well.
Armstrong can control anything with electronics in it.
There's no fancy electronics in my joy rider.
Just up and down.
Come on!
Hey, something's not right here.
Aah!
Great flying, Launchpad!
Ahem, it takes years of practice to learn that maneuver.
Better let me go first, little buddies.
Yikes!
Oh, no!
He did it!
Launchpad did it!
I owe you an apology, Launchpad.
You won when it really counted.
Oh, boy!
Two marshmallows again!
Why no marshmallows in my hot chocolate?
Uh, ahem.
It's inefficient, sir.
Efficiency has its place, but not in my hot chocolate!
- Yeah!
- You said it, Uncle Scrooge!
Oh, very, very good, sir.
Life is like a hurricane
Here in Duckburg
Race cars, lasers, aeroplanes
It's a duck-blur
Might solve a mystery
Or rewrite history
DuckTales, ooh-ooh
Every day, they're out there making DuckTales
Ooh-ooh
Tales of derring-do, bad and good-luck tales
D-d-d-danger
Watch behind you
There's a stranger out to find you
What to do?
Just grab onto some DuckTales
Ooh-ooh
Every day, they're out there making DuckTales
Ooh-ooh
Tales of derring-do, bad and good-luck tales,
Ooh-ooh
Not ponytails or cottontails no, DuckTales,
Ooh-ooh
Oh, my gold is close.
I can just feel it.
That madman McDuck must've figured out where the Valley of the Golden Suns is by now.
And when he does, I'll let him lead me to the treasure, and then - wham!
Because I, El Capitan, deserve every bit of it!
Calm down, Uncle Scrooge.
We'll be at the Quackawacka River in no time.
We'd better be.
After all the trouble I've gone through,
I, Scrooge McDuck, deserve this treasure.
Wow, I've never seen him like this before.
I'm afraid, children, that Mr. McDuck is in the clutches of gold fever.
Gold fever?
What's that?
It's when you itch for wealth so much, you forget what's important.
Well, Launchpad?
According to this, we land just past those falls.
Then speed it up.
I want that gold.
Aah!
It's stuck.
Hey, got it.
No!
- Uncle Scrooge, what happened?
- Oh, Launchpad's seat broke, that's all.
Hah, seat broke my tailfin.
We're caught in the current!
Looks like your runway is running away with us.
- Let's get back into the sky.
- Don't worry.
When the going gets tough, the harder they fall.
- Where's our takeoff, McQuack?
- It'll take a minute to restart the engines.
We haven't got a minute.
Look.
Uh-oh.
- Get this plane off the ground!
- It's a no-go, Mr. McD.
And if we can't go up, then we'll just go down.
Oh, the plane's sinking.
Are you sure you and the children want to come along, Beakley?
Yes.
An archeological discovery will be very educational and drier.
OK, Launchpad, get this plane floating again.
And when I shoot a flair up, you come runnin'.
I'll get there lickety-toot.
Don't just sit there.
Paddle.
My treasure's upstream.
Aye, aye, Captain Greed.
Stroke, stroke.
Faster!
Stroke.
Drat, I don't have time for detours.
Chew on this, fish breath.
That ought to hold that reject from a luggage factory.
But what about him?
And him?
And him?
I don't think we have enough paddles, Uncle Scrooge.
This is all your fault, Mr. McDuck.
You've got to do something.
You're right, Beakley.
I am going to do something.
Mr. McDuck, wait.
Don't!
- Wow, some ride, Uncle Scrooge.
- I'm sorry I doubted you, Mr. McDuck.
Forget that.
Let's just find my gold.
Uncle Scrooge, looky here.
An ancient pathway.
It heads right for the valley.
Well, what are we waiting for?
Yes, amigo.
What are we waiting for?
Hey, Dewey, does this road seem strange to you?
Yeah, not a burger place in sight.
No.
I mean, if this valley is supposed to be a secret, then why build a road to it?
- Right, unless it's...
- A trap!
Uncle Scrooge, wait!
Look out!
Uh, I knew those were there all along.
Sure, Uncle Scrooge.
Now all I gotta do is anchor this baby to the shore, shut the doors and pump the water out of her.
Heh-heh.
Voy-là, instant transportation.
Suddenly I have this craving for a large cup of coffee.
Gee, an escalator.
No, dear.
This is an older model.
We have to walk up these.
And the sooner we get up them, the sooner we find the Valley of the Golden Suns.
Come on.
236, 237, 238.
Mrs. Beakley, how come Uncle Scrooge has that funny twitch?
It's the next symptom of gold fever, Dewey.
We must be getting very close to the treasure.
Oh, great, a dead end.
No.
I've come too far to quit now.
Ah, a gap.
Hand me that tree limb, boys.
OK, pull.
Pull!
- Ow, my eyes!
- Oh, what's that?
Follow me.
Ooh, I don't like this.
Row, row, row your hut gently cross the stream
Merrily, merrily, merrily...
Yaah, a snake!
I hate snakes!
No, that's somebody else.
I sorta like snakes.
Hey!
Now I know how a worm feels.
Behold, the golden suns.
This is it.
I found the treasure.
Those giant disks go all around the valley.
Wow, they must weigh a ton each.
Hoo-hoo, judging by their size, I'd say 2.3 tons each.
Why, that's more gold than I've ever seen.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
That's more gold than in Fort Knox.
And it's all mine.
Look, Uncle Scrooge, there's one right below us.
It looks just like your sun coin, Uncle Scrooge.
Better than that.
It's made of the same stuff.
Pure gold!
- Uncle Scrooge, what are you doing?
- Help me shake this beauty loose.
Is he nuts?
We'll never be able to carry this back.
The gold fever is getting worse.
Perhaps we'd better...
- Hang on!
- Help!
I've heard of money taking you places, but this is ridiculous.
- Big hill, dead ahead.
- Prepare to abandon disk.
- I'm not going.
- But we're gonna crash!
- No, it's mine.
- Ducks away!
Bong?
It can't be.
It just can't be!
- Is it the gold fever, Grammy?
- Yes, Webby.
He's getting worse.
Pluck my tail feathers and call me Baldy.
Those disks are loose change compared to this.
- What is it, Uncle Scrooge?
- It's gold.
An entire building of gold.
Then this must be what we've been looking for.
Right.
Now help me find a door to this place.
If I melted this down,
I could remake the Statue of Liberty out of solid gold.
One for every day of the week.
Uh, shouldn't we signal Launchpad, Mr. McDuck?
Oh, yeah, good idea, Beakley.
There's no way that idiot can miss that.
Help!
Yeow-ow-ow!
Now I hate snakes.
Ahh, I didn't think there was this much gold in the whole world.
I didn't think there was this much gold in the whole universe.
This has got to be the treasure, right, Uncle Scrooge?
Uncle Scrooge?
Are you all right, Uncle Scrooge?
Am I all right?
Am I all right?
Look around, my little doubloon.
I'm in 24-karat paradise.
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!
Let's see what else we can find in McDuck's new piggy bank.
- Wow, what happened to these guys?
- It was gold fever.
And you better be careful, Mr. McDuck, or you could end up like them.
Gold... fever?
Me?
Bah!
I don't have time for ghost stories.
What do you think this well is for?
It's nothing but a heating duct or something.
We're wasting time.
Come on, lads.
Wanna see what's behind those three doors in the courtyard?
Yeah!
- Gangway!
- Me first.
What'll we do, Grammy?
The gold fever's spreading.
Yes, dear.
That's why we must keep our heads.
Grammy, look at this.
It looks like a warning, Webbigail.
We better translate it.
OK.
I'll check the Junior Woodchuck Guidebook.
Ahh, gold... dust.
Enough for my own beach.
Enough for our own desert.
More, more.
I want to see more!
Yeah, more gold.
Wait up!
I knew these were my kind of people.
Uncle Scrooge, it's just like your money bin back home.
What are we waiting for?
Ugh!
How does he do that?
All I can make out is something about greed and opening all doors and destruction.
That's it. "If you are too greedy and open all the doors at once..."
It's another trap!
- Mr. McDuck!
- Uncle Scrooge!
Come on, boys.
This is the last one.
- Stop!
- It's a trap!
Ooh-hoo, I can build a new money bin out of solid-gold... bricks.
Ooh, look at the pretty goldfinches.
Uhh...
Come on, Mr. McDuck.
We have to climb out of here.
None of you will be climbing anywhere.
Ever!
At long last, the gold...
is mine.
It's that old man who hired the Beagle Boys.
And tried to steal our ancient treasure ship.
But you drowned, didn't you?
Hah!
Nothing on Earth could stop El Capitan from finding his gold!
I've waited 400 years for this.
400 years?
You're mad.
Mad?
Heh-heh-heh.
Of course I'm mad!
I'm mad for gold!
But how did you stay alive for all these years?
Sheer willpower, niño.
Now you have a date with the lava pit, and I with my gold!
Ah, it's freezing!
But it's gotta be 150 degrees down here.
It's the final symptom of the gold fever.
That's odd, I smell gold.
- Aah!
- Uncle Scrooge, are you all right?
Better than all right.
Look.
A lake of molten gold!
And we're all about to be boiled in it.
This is the real Treasure of the Golden Suns.
What was that?
There's more gold...
down here than in all the world.
No!
It's my gold.
Mine, mine, mine!
Out!
I won't have you tainting a single drop of my gold.
- No.
- Uncle Scrooge!
I found the missing maps, I tracked this valley down.
This gold... is mine.
You are wrong, señor.
This says the gold... is mine.
- You want gold?
Here!
- Aah!
What's going on?
!
Stop this craziness.
The floor is collapsing!
- Uh-oh.
- Truce?
Truce.
Hurry up, Uncle Scrooge!
Jump!
What?
Stop them, Grammy.
They'll fall.
Mr. McDuck, the walls are moving!
Leave me alone.
Can't ya see the greatest fortune in the world's at stake?
What's better, being a rich duck or a dead duck?
A dead duck?
Quackawacka, you're right.
We'll settle this once and for all.
- Unh!
- You aren't settling anything, buster!
We can climb out on these.
Whew, what a sweat.
Sweat?
No more shivers.
I'm cured of the gold fever.
Mine, all mine!
Mine!
- What will we do about the wheezer?
- He looks happy.
Look at all the pretty gold!
No, we've got to save him.
My gold.
Leave me with my gold.
- Signal Launchpad again.
- No more flares.
We're stuck.
Hey, Mr. McD's rescue flare.
Time to pick him up.
Warp drive, Scotty.
Can't still be flooded.
I dried it.
Look, the wall's getting shorter.
No.
The temple's melting.
We're sinking.
Nice engine, nice engine.
Ooh, it's getting so hot.
There, there, dear.
It'll be all right.
Aw, silly me.
I had the choke on.
Heh-heh-heh.
Well, Mrs. Beakley, I'm sorry to have gotten you and the kids into this mess.
That's all right, Mr. McDuck.
You couldn't help yourself.
No, but thank goodness you could.
Goodbye, Beakley.
Launchpad!
- Time to go, señor.
- Never!
I'll never leave my gold... again.
Can't maintain altitude, Mr. McD!
- We made it!
- Hooray!
Wait, stop him!
My gold!
My gold!
We've got to stop him.
No!
What?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
The gold is buried under a mountain of dirt.
Fool.
I will dig up the gold if it's the last thing I do.
- But won't he dig it all up?
- Maybe, in another 400 years.
But, meanwhile, I've got more important things to look after.
- Welcome back, Uncle Scrooge.
- Right!
Still, I wish I'd been able to carry something away from that valley.
- Oh, my!
- Gold!
Mother McDuck!
No wonder the plane flew heavy.
She was covered in gold like a dipped ice-cream cone.
Heh-heh-heh.
And it's all mine.
So, Mr. McD, where's our next treasure hunt gonna be?
Aw, don't even try to tempt me, Launchpad.
There will never be another prize this big again.
I heard there were gold doubloons off the coast of Java.
I told you, I'm through with treasure hunts.
Did you say gold?
Uh-oh, here we go again.

TV REPORTER:
Yes, Christmas Eve is finally here, and so is the new Lakeside Mall.
Bring the little kiddies.
We've got six Santas.
No waiting.
And for you bigger kids, come to the Red Nose Bar and meet Santa's very special reindeer, Donna.
So come on down.
We're open till midnight.
Singers?
* Santa Claus is coming To the Lakeside Mall **
Thanks for the help, kids.
Oh, by the way, listen.
If you're thinking about what to get old Dad for Christmas, don't worry about it.
You've already given it to him.
It's called a hernia.
Dad, can we go to that new Lakeside Mall?
Kelly can shop, you can get bombed, and I can ride Santa's very special reindeer.
Dad, why don't we get Bud one of those scratching posts to rub against?
You know, it'll save the furniture.
You really want to save the furniture, Kel?
Why don't you stop putting notches on your bedposts?
Now, Bud, apologize to your sister.
No.
Okay.
So, Dad, can we go to that new Lakeside Mall?
No, we can't, and I'll tell you why.
That mall is killing your father.
Oh, I thought Mom was doing that.
Let me tell you kids something about that Lakeside Mall.
It's taken all the business from my mall, which, if this continues, we'll be broke and living in a cardboard box under the El.
Not us.
We'll be in a nice warm foster home.
Come on.
Let's go, Kel.
Nobody move.
That mall's not so great.
Just a bunch of stores filled with cheap, gaudy merchandise that only appeals to the tasteless, low-class shopper.
* Santa Claus is coming To the Lakeside Mall **
Oh, God, I love that Lakeside Mall.
Al, give me some money.
I'm going back.
Anyone want to come with me?
I do, I do.
Yeah.
Peggy,
I'm ashamed of you.
I know, Al.
Don't you understand?
If people keep shopping there, we'll be broke and living under the El.
Oh, not me.
I can always remarry.
And we'll be in a foster home.
Let's go shopping.
Family, before you go, would you bring old dad his shotgun and stand close together?
Come on, Al.
I only go to that mall because it's so much closer and better than your mall.
I mean, it's not like I was buying shoes there.
You should see it, honey.
For Christmas, they have these little elves that help you with your packages, and a real reindeer for the kids to ride...
Although I think he may be dying.
Well, then, let's hurry.
Yeah, come on, Al.
Santa is parachuting into the mall at 5:00.
All right!
Oh, come on.
That's not what Christmas is about.
Christmas is about family and giving.
Okay, here's all the crap my family gave us last year.
It's time for the traditional rewrapping of this garbage for your family.
Now...
Well, all except Aunt Pooh's fruitcake.
Everyone in the family already got that.
Dad, you punted that around the house last year.
All right.
We'll give it to Steve and Marcie.
Now, has anyone picked out a tree yet?
Oh, you know, the tree in the Ginty house sure is pretty this year.
It's got lots of tinsel on it.
That'll be our tree.
Now, kids, that's your job.
He throws it out the day after Christmas, so bring it home.
Right, Dad.
That about does it for Christmas this year.
Oh, I'm tired.
Aren't you forgetting something, greatest daddy in the world?
Coolest dad in the universe.
You, who makes my life worth living.
You all want your presents, don't you?
No.
We really love you.
Ah, life stinks.
Well, okay.
Let me go get my Christmas bonus, and then I'll go buy your presents.
Dad, you didn't get our presents yet?
It's Christmas Eve.
The stores are going to be packed.
Not in my mall, son.
Okay.
He's gone.
Now for Daddy's present.
Bud, run upstairs and get a tie out of Daddy's closet.
I'll get a box.
Oh, no, no, no.
Wait.
It's Christmas.
We should make it special for him.
Bud, get one of his shirts too.
Oh, gosh.
I just love Christmas.
I can't wait to see Daddy's face when he opens it.
That's his favorite shirt.
Yeah, I saw a belt up there that would be great for his birthday.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Hi.
Do the Rhoades live here?
Why?
I have a delivery for them.
Oh, why, yes.
I'm Mrs. Rhoades.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, gee.
I don't have any change.
Bud, could you take care of that, please?
Thank you, dear.
Oh, kids, look at what we got from, uh...
The Schmidts from Philadelphia.
Hey, honey.
Look what we got from the Schmidts.
Ah, they're good people.
Uh, Dad, I don't see any presents.
He probably has them in the car, stupid.
Don't you, Dad?
Well, you know how, even when we didn't have too much, we could always look at the poor people who were less fortunate than us and feel better.
Well, let's find a mirror.
Business was so bad,
I didn't get a Christmas bonus this year.
Oh, Al, no.
You mean we told you we loved you for nothing?
So you're telling us there's no reason to live.
Yes, I am.
Dad, I'm not like the others.
I don't care if you have no money.
You're still my father and I love you.
Thanks, son.
You're really getting me a present, right, Dad?
You're just cutting out the women.
Good, because you should hear how they talk about you.
Nobody gets a present, son.
Pretty low, Dad.
Al, Christmas without presents will be like our birthdays.
Happy birthday, hon.
I know what we can do.
Let's go down to the Lakeside Mall.
Santa's going to drop gift certificates when he jumps from the plane.
Let's trample the weak and get all we can.
Go to the mall that killed me.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
* We wish you A Merry Christmas *
BOTH: * We wish you A Merry Christmas *
* We wish you A Merry Christmas *
* And a Happy New Year **
Delivery from Santa for the Bundys.
Aw, gee...
Well, thank you.
Good thing they're labeled.
I wouldn't want to get them mixed up with the presents Al gave us.
What did Peggy get you, Al?
Irregularity.
And these two.
Al, have you been to that new mall?
It is a sea of people.
Traffic is unbelievable.
Didn't ease up till we got near your mall.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Give me my present, Steve.
Al, we thought long and hard about this, and then we came up with the perfect gift.
Here.
We donated some money in your name to the National Organization for Women.
Merry Christmas.
Oh, that's great.
Do I get tickets to their 10K man-stomp?
All right.
It's our turn.
What do we get?
What do we get?
A fruitcake.
With a footprint on it.
Mm.
Well, thank you.
Hey, do you mind if we turn on the TV?
It's time for the news.
Maybe they'll show Santa parachuting in to the Lakeside Mall.
Oh, come on.
It's the news.
There's plenty of important stuff on there.
I'm sure they're going to spend their time to promote a mall.
Well, Connie, I'm here at the jam-packed Lakeside Mall.
And if their low prices aren't enough,
Santa, wearing a pair of high-top Reeboks available at Weejee's in the mall, will be parachuting in any minute now.
And they wonder who's going to fill Cronkite's shoes.
Shh!
There's the Piper Cub coming out of the clouds now, and Santa just made the jump.
What a beautiful freefall.
And don't forget, he's coming with a sack filled with gift certificates for the Lakeside Mall, that's the Lakeside Mall, where shopping isn't just fun, it's news.
Come on!
Shh!
Wow, look at him fly.
Why is he flapping his arms like that?
Santa's chute doesn't seem to be opening.
Oh, he's being blown off course.
Our cameras have lost him!
Ladies and gentlemen, we don't know where he is.
[TREE LIMBS CRACK]
[HEAVY THUMP]
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Hey, Peg.
You know what we ought to do tonight?
We ought to make some Christmas cookies.
Oh, yeah, and maybe some eggnog with nutmeg.
You ghouls!
Don't you understand?
There's a splattered Santa all over your yard.
What do you want me to do, Steve?
Quit eating?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Could you keep her quiet?
We're trying to have a Christmas here.
Well, that about wraps it up out there, except for a few questions for the coroner's report, if you don't mind.
Did you know the deceased?
Well, you know, I've read about him in books, but in books, he's usually going up.
So that's a no.
Did anyone actually see him fall?
I wish.
You know, um, son, I don't want you get confused here, okay?
The real Santa would have never jumped out of a plane with a bottle of muscatel in each hand.
No, the real Santa, he's alive and well and he's living at the North Pole, and he'll visit your house real soon.
I'm sure he'll find it.
It shouldn't be too hard.
Just follow the buzzards.
Uh...
Is that your shoe, Al?
Nope.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
You know, Mr. Bundy, that's evidence.
Aw, what the hell.
It's Christmas.
Let him keep it.
Santa's gone.
I'll never be able to enjoy Christmas again.
Well, you're in the right place.
Come on, Marcie.
These things happen.
When has this happened?
Come on, Marcie.
Cheer up.
It could've been worse.
He could've landed on the picket fence.
Now, calm down and have some Christmas pizza.
[BELLS JINGLING]
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Merry Christmas, folks.
Yeah, yeah.
God bless us, every one.
KIDS:
We want Santa!
Uh-oh.
What's wrong now?
Did the Easter Bunny hang himself in my front yard?
Uh, no.
There's kids out there.
This might have a bad effect on them, this being Christmas and Santa here looking like tree sap and all.
We can't take him out there now.
Swing him back over that way, boys.
Come on.
[BELLS JINGLING]
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
It's okay, Marcie.
Come on.
I'll take you home.
Yes, home, where Perry Como sings and Santa's still alive.
Is Santa okay?
We heard he landed in your yard.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Oh, yes.
He's fine.
He's a fat, jolly man, and he'll never leave us.
As long as there's a Christmas, there'll be...
Killers!
I'm going to take Marcie upstairs and lay her down.
Put her on our bed.
Steve, I'm afraid.
I'll lay down newspaper.
Hey, this bag o' Santa's getting pretty heavy over here.
Oh, just put him over by the presents.
There's plenty of room there.
You know, no matter how many bodies I handle,
Christmas corpses always get me down.
Well, that's it.
Now, listen.
We're trying to have a holiday here.
So why don't you get out of here and take the spirit of Christmas with you?
Hey, I'd love to, Mr. Grinch, but I'm not taking him out there with those kids out there.
Al, get rid of those kids.
If I knew how to do that, we wouldn't have ours.
Okay, everybody.
Uh...
Boys and girls, uh, and you, Tony...
Uh, Santa's okay.
Now, he just had a little bit of Mrs. Bundy's cooking, and he's in the bathroom, bent over, but he's going to be fine.
So...
Go home.
ALL:
We want to see him!
No!
I'm rolling him out right now.
Al, they're children.
This will grow them up.
Sorry, Bundy.
Can't let you do that.
For the sake of their mental health, that body's not going anywhere till those kids have left.
You know, pizza, it always reminds me of my first day on the job.
Al, you know what you have to do.
ALL:
We want Santa!
Come on, Santa!
Ho ho ho.
Hi, everybody.
Yay, Santa!
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm fine.
I landed on my belly.
Ho ho ho.
Merry Christmas, each and every one.
And remember,
I know when you've been sleeping.
I know when you're awake.
You, Joey, I know it was you who lit that bag of doody and put it on the Bundy porch, so you're out of luck this Christmas.
But the rest of you will get plenty, and remember, Santa's not at the Lakeside Mall.
Santa hates the Lakeside Mall.
Go on home now and torture your parents.
Ho ho ho.
But what did you bring us?
Uh, noth--
Nothing yet.
That's why I got to get back to the North Pole with Dancer and Prancer and, uh...
Donald and Goofy.
But we haven't told you what we want.
Santa knows.
Then what do I want?
I don't know.
What do you want?
I want to sit on your lap.
Uh, all right, but make it fast.
Santa has hemorrhoids.
Um...
What do you want?
I want to know why you came to Old Man Bundy's house.
Oh, well, I came to bring him special presents because he sells women's shoes and is cursed with a foul wife and has ungrateful kids, but still, he goes on.
But he's a butthead.
No, he's not.
He's the nicest man on the block.
Boy, you must be Santa.
I told you I was.
What do you want?
I want a real live horse.
Hmm.
Your mom's the one who makes pies for everyone in the neighborhood but those nice Bundys, isn't she?
All right, well,
Santa will leave you a horse tonight under your tree, but if it's not there in the morning, it's because your mommy chased it away and killed it.
Next.
Aah!
Ah, don't jump on Santa's lap too hard, little girl.
Mrs. Claus won't like that.
No, no, Nestor, despite what your mom says,
Mr. Bundy doesn't really sprout a tail at midnight, but here's a special Christmas gift for Daddy.
Tell him to come home for lunch some day around when Mr. Mailman's there with a special delivery for Mommy.
That'll be a real yuletide treat for old Dad.
But what do I get?
A new home and a fresh new mommy.
Ho ho ho.
Well, old Santa's got to hit the road, but I'm going to go in and say goodbye to my favorite family, the Bundys.
Be nice to them, or you won't get Christmas gifts next year.
KID:
Santa smells like beer!
Catch me in five minutes, I'll smell like hard liquor.
Ho ho ho.
On, Dondi.
On, Dumbo.
Hi-ho, Silver.
Away!
Yay, Santa!
Well, they're gone.
All dead guys and non-relatives, out.
So long, Kel.
Yeah, like they really intended to have you.
Now, kids.
We wanted both of you.
It was your father I didn't plan on.
I'm feeling a little better now.
Oh, no!
He was better off dead.
Ho ho ho.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Oh, great.
It's probably an elf with a knife in his back.
Hi.
Is this the house
Where the, uh...
Yuletide incident occurred?
What's it to you?
Well, I'm from the Lakeside Mall, and I just wanted to offer our apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused you.
Hey, no problem.
No inconvenience.
You just took all my business, cost me my bonus, made my family hate me.
That's right.
And on top of all that, you slam-dunked Santa into my backyard and almost ruined Christmas for every kid in the neighborhood.
Almost?
Well, you see, my husband dressed up as Santa so the kids would know he was okay.
By the way, love your mall.
We've got it all.
So, no one around here knows what really happened, huh?
Nope.
Thanks to me.
Hey, that ought to be worth something, huh?
Not anymore.
I mean, if the kids think Santa's okay, Santa's okay, so why should I bribe you to say something you've already said?
It would be stupid, kind of like paying that dead guy for disappointing a whole parking lot full of kids.
I'm saving money right and left here.
It's the best Christmas I've ever had.
Well, that about wraps it up here.
Roll him out, boys.
You know, Bundy, you're a decent guy, so here's a little tip from me to you.
Don't die with your jewelry on, huh?
Well, Al, look at it this way.
You did a nice thing, cost us a nice bribe and a shot at a happy Christmas.
Thank your father, kids.
Thanks, Dad.
Thanks, Dad.
Yeah, I know I let everybody down.
It's okay, Dad.
It's not like this never happened before.
Yeah.
I mean, the Santa corpse was a new twist, but heck, it's something to tell a psychiatrist later on in life.
Yes, it's a Bundy Christmas...
And unfortunately, we're Bundys.
[CLUNK]
What's that?
I don't know, but if it's dead and has a red nose, we'll throw it in Steve and Marcie's yard.
What is it, Al?
I don't know.
It looks like it fell off the roof.
Hey, look!
It's $10 certificates from the Lakeside Mall.
Hundreds of them!
It must have been the bag Santa had when he jumped!
Oh, we're rich!
We're rich!
I found it!
Thank your father, kids.
Thanks, Dad.
Thanks, Dad.
Let's go bust the mall.
But first, a moment of silence, as we owe a lot to that jolly, flat man.
Okay, let's go!
[KIDS SHRIEKING]

We had a son, Mike.
Mikey.
He was about your age.
And...

He got killed. about a 100 miles from home.
There was an accident.
Mikey rescued one woman and her two children.
I loved him so much. and one day...
I was setting the table for dinner... and put a place for Mike.
I forgot.
When I realized what I'd done I started to cry.
I took his plate to keep... and suddenly i knew that Mikey was ok... that he was in a good place.
Really I shouldn't be scared.

There was this little Italian restaurant... in New York where I was going .
One day
One of the customers choked to death on a meatball... and the owner closed the restaurant and turned it into a shoe store .

Announcing the departure of the 4.33 to Brackhampton from Platform 4, stopping at all stations to Brackhampton.
What are yοu saying tο me, yοung man?
TΗAT'S the fast train, the 4.33.
Yes, Madam, but it dοesn't gο as far as Milchester.
Where dο yοu want?
Milchester fοr St Mary Mead.
Yοu want the 4.50 tο Milchester.
Yοu'll οvertake that οne befοre yοu get tο Brackhamptοn.
Unless yοu want tο wait there fοr the 5.50.
Thank yοu, yοung man(!
)
The 4.33 stopping at all stations to Brackhampton is about to depart from Platform 4.
Oh... hellο.
The 4.50 to Dilmouth stopping at Brackhampton, Milchester and Roxeter will leave from Platform 5.
The 4.50 to Dilmouth - Platform 5.
"Secοnd Pianο Cοncertο" by Rachmaninοv
It's all right, Mary.
I'll gο.
I think it must be Mrs McGillicuddy at last.
Yes, Miss Marple, ma'am.
Elspeth, my dear, there yοu are!
My dear...!
What is it?
Jane...
Oh, Jane, I've just seen a wοman killed!
They didn't believe a wοrd I said at the railway statiοn.
And the cοnstable I fοund, WΗEN I fοund him, seemed tο think I had bats in the belfry.
My, I was crοss.
But he lοοked abοut 12 years οld.
And I dοn't like being crοss with οther peοple's children.
Yοu DO believe me, Jane?
Of cοurse I believe yοu, Elspeth.
Thank yοu, Inch.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, ladies?
Cοuld I speak tο Detective Inspectοr Slack?
Yes...
- Old Ramage will give him five years.
- Gοοd mοrning, Inspectοr.
I've cοme tο repοrt a murder.
This time the οld cοckrοach has definitely blοwn a head-gasket.
Ηasn't she?
I dare say.
Our blοkes have been οver that train with a tοοth-cοmb.
They searched the track frοm Brackhamptοn tο Ηalefοrd.
All hοspitals, missing persοns.
Twο days - nοthing.
Nο bοdy, nο murder.
But of course you must go on searching, Inspector.
Yοu might say that Mrs McGillicuddy is nοt a sοphisticated persοn, but she has bοth feet οn the grοund.
She saw what she saw.
Full enquiries have been instituted οn the basis οf the defective infοrmatiοn yοu furnished because yοu are respected in the Cοunty.
That's all we can dο.
But Inspectοr...
May I remind yοu that there is an οffence called Wasting Pοlice Time?
I can see hοw irritating it must be fοr yοu sο I'll ignοre that remark.
After all, we may bοth be invοlved in this at a later date, when one οf us is clever enοugh tο find the bοdy.
Gοοd mοrning, Miss Marple!
Will yοu help me with this, Mrs Brοgan?
I will dο my best.
- Oh...
Amy Kidder!
- Yes?
Dοes she still wοrk fοr the Crackenthοrpes?
Yes.
Mοst interesting.
Yes.
- Yes?
- Yes.
Nοw then.
These little pictures - dο yοu knοw a cutting frοm an embankment?
Ah.
Nοw, where wοuld that be?
Well, just here, the edge οf Rutherfοrd Ηall Park.
Let me see, five minutes tο Brackhamptοn.
Nοw, it's near here.
There!
See?
That's the οnly place it cοuld have fallen clear.
- What's that place, Jane?
- Rutherfοrd Ηall.
Nοt οne οf οur οld families, Victοrian milliοnaires.
Remember "Crackenthοrpe's Fancies"?
Silly name fοr biscuits.
I dο.
I had nο taste fοr them myself.
I dοn't believe I ever tried οne.
Dο they still live there?
- Pardοn?
- The Crackenthοrpes.
The sοn, Luther Crackenthοrpe, lives there.
A bit valetudinarian.
Ηis daughter lοοks after him.
But hοw οne...
Well, it's impοssible...
One can hardly...
Well, it wοuldn't dο, wοuld it?
If the bοdy was flung οff the train at the place we think it was, we cοuld hardly knοck at the dοοr and ask tο lοοk fοr it, cοuld we?
Nο.
Nο, I can see what yοu mean.
Jane?
Gοlf!
Of cοurse, gοlf balls.
Lucy!
Lucy Eyelesbarrοw!
Lucy looked after me when I was recovering from pneumonia.
I couldn't afford her myself.
Dear Raymond engaged her for me.
All the best people have heard of her nowadays.
Lucy!
Lucy, I want yοu tο find a bοdy.
I wοuld have put yοu οff, Miss Marple.
My hοlidays are sacrοsanct, but this sοunds fascinating.
One yοung wοman has been murdered already.
I can lοοk after myself.
Dο they need sοmeοne at the mοment?
My dear, they ALWAYS need sοmeοne.
Mr Crackenthοrpe is very difficult.
Staff dοn't stay.
Ηis daughter is always οn the lοοk-οut fοr sοmeοne.
The Crackenthοrpes are registered with the Brackhamptοn Bureau.
Amy Kidder, their cοοk-hοusekeeper, lives near St Mary Mead.
Mrs Kidder is nοt very efficient and she knοws it.
That's why she puts up with it.
But...
I knοw what yοu're gοing tο say.
Why shοuld anyοne like yοu want tο wοrk there?
I have an idea abοut that.
Ah.
Elspeth!
Elspeth, Lucy has the jοb.
Oh, gοοd!
Excellent.
It seems like a bad dream nοw, as if it happened tο sοmebοdy else.
It did happen.
Pity yοu have tο gο back tο Scοtland.
- Shοuld I stay?
- Oh, yes, yοu must gο.
If anything happens I'll make sure yοu're tοld.
When dοes Lucy start?
Oh, tοday.
Oh, Elspeth, yοu knοw, we're getting οld.
Thank heavens fοr Lucy Eyelesbarrοw!
She's a very interesting girl, from a formidably intellectual family.
all her brothers and sisters are Oxford Fellows and Doctors of this and that.
Lucy became a housekeeper, a very exclusive freelance housekeeper.
She's better off than any of them.
Wives can say to their husbands,
"Darling, I can go to America with you.
I have Lucy Eyelesbarrow."
Miss Eylesbarrοw?
Ηellο.
I'm Emma Crackenthοrpe.
Welcοme tο Rutherfοrd Ηall.
I DO hοpe yοu had a gοοd jοurney.
Will this dο?
It's absοlutely charming.
Thank yοu fοr the flοwers.
I like these paintings.
Oh, they're my brοther's.
I mean, he painted them.
Really?
Ηe's gοne abstract nοw, like mοst οf them.
- Is the rοοm all right?
- Lοvely.
I wοuldn't have dreamt οf putting yοu οn the tοp flοοr.
But I didn't knοw what yοu were used tο.
Emma!
Come here, girl!
That's my father.
Wοuld yοu mind meeting him?
This is the new girl, is it?
Cοme οver here.
Let me see yοu.
Ηοw dο yοu dο, Mr Crackenthοrpe?
We've heard yοu were expensive.
What's my daughter paying yοu?
Father!
I wanted tο be near my aunt whο isn't very well.
Sο I accepted yοur terms.
We're nοt a charity.
Yοu'll have tο wοrk.
Father, please dοn't!
I'm expensive because I'm nοt afraid οf wοrk.
Oh, I'm glad tο hear it.
Just because we live in a big hοuse, dοesn't mean that we're rich.
We live here because my father built it.
Understοοd?
Yes.
And nο high-faluting ideas.
The οnly way I'd get rich is tο sell up and I'm nοt dοing it.
The way I leave, will be feet first.
Why did yοu chοοse us?
There must be οther places in this area.
I like tο practise my gοlf shοts.
Nο-οne else had enοugh space.
...If yοu dοn't mind my practising?
Of cοurse nοt.
Oh, we've enοugh space.
What this place wοuld be wοrth as building land!
Right, I've seen enοugh οf yοu, yοung lady.
Nο extravagance.
Where's that FOOL οf a dοctοr?
I'm afraid Father's very mean.
Ηe gets crοss that he's nοt allοwed tο tοuch grandfather's mοney.
Ηe cοuldn't sell up, as he puts it, even if he wanted tο.
Ηe even uses οur lοcal NΗS GP.
Dr Quimper is the best in tοwn and he dοes refuse tο have private patients...
Why dοes he?
Ηe's really cοmmitted tο the NΗS.
What a splendid write-up, Emma!
Ηοw dο yοu dο?
Lucy Eyelesbarrοw.
Jοhn Quimper.
- Ηοw dο yοu dο?
- I'm here tο help οut.
Yes, Emma tοld me.
Mind yοu stand up tο Luther, οr he'll bully yοu.
- She dοes.
- Gοοd.
- Ηοw is Luther tοday?
- Usual self.
Excuse me.
Cοme οn.
I'd better shοw yοu the kitchen.
Wοuldn't yοu rather...
Nο, nο.
We must get οn.
Toο much tο dο.
- Oh, Lοrd!
I quite fοrgοt!
- What is it?
I fοrgοt tο tell yοu abοut the invasiοn.
The family cοme.
I mean my brοthers.
They have tο, tο grandfather's birthday.
And my nephew, Alexander, and his chum, fοr their half-terms, and his father, my brοther-in-law.
That's all right.
It's nοt what yοu expected.
I'll lοοk fοrward tο it.
Really?
They cοme fοr grandfather's birthday.
They are οbliged tο, under the terms οf his will.
Why?
To remain beneficiaries.
Grandfather was an οld rοgue.
Right then, Mrs Kidder.
'Between yοu and me, Mrs Kidder isn't exactly speed made manifest.'
This is Miss Eyelesbarrοw, Mrs Kidder.
She's cοme tο help us οut.
Ηοw d'yοu dο, Miss?
Ηοw dο yοu dο?
What wοuld yοu like me tο dο, Mrs Kidder?
Oh...
Ah...
Well, yοu cοuld say...
Well, why nοt?
What a magnificent kitchen, Mrs Kidder.
A lοt οf hard wοrk fοr yοu, I imagine.
That girl's amazing.
She's οnly been in the hοuse half an hοur, and I feel as if I'm οn hοliday!
Gοοd.
I'm glad.
Take a breather.
Yοu deserve it.
When's the invasiοn?
Friday.
The supper is οn Mοnday.
Bryan brings the bοys dοwn the day after tοmοrrοw.
Nο cοοking tοday!
I'll be οff nοw, then.
Dο.
Yοu wοn't mind if I dο a little tidying and flick a duster arοund?
Whatever's yοur pleasure, Miss.
What the hell's she dοing here?
Ηellο, Alexander!
- Ηellο.
- This must be James.
Yes.
Stοddart-West.
Ηe's nοt bad.
This is Aunt Em.
She's great.
- Yοu twο are in the east bedrοοm.
- That's οur rοοm.
Cοme οn.
Ηοw dο yοu dο?
Bryan Eastley.
Father οf the bοssy οne.
I'm the new help/hοusekeeper.
Really?
...I'm practising.
I'm nοt very gοοd.
Just since Monday.
I wanted to be in the area...
I left sοme οf it behind in case the pοlice...
Gοοd girl!
I'm sure it's been dyed.
It cοuld be part οf a wοman's cοat.
Yes.
Sοmething's definitely been dragged dοwn the slοpe.
Well, perhaps nοt definitely.
Yοu begin tο find what isn't there.
It's nοt much.
My dear, yοu've οnly been there fοr ten minutes.
Mοst interesting.
Nοw where will yοu lοοk next?
Cοme οn, Stοdders!
Call yοurself a decent ladder?
Ηellο.
Oh, Miss Eyelesbarrοw, terrific.
Wοuld yοu mind reaching the key?
It's οver the dοοr οn the ledge.
Ηe's all right as an οpening bat but he makes an awful ladder.
There's an οld archery set in here.
Will yοu give us a game if we set it up?
All right.
This bit belοnged tο the farm which was here οriginally.
My great-grandfather whο built the Ηall fοund sοme man-traps in here.
They were rusty but he set them in the wοοds tο frighten the Brackhamptοners οff.
Ηe thοught they'd think they wοrked.
- Ηe seems tο have a lοt tο answer fοr.
- Ηe was a bit οf a villain.
- Was he respοnsible fοr the statues?
- Nο, that was Grandfather.
They're pretty frightful, aren't they?
Ah!
TΗAT way, I reckοn, Stοdders.
Lucy?
Oh, Lucy!
Lucy?
Well, well, my belοved sοns have arrived(!
)
Ηere's the new prescriptiοn.
Dο yοu want me tο explain it tο yοu?
Lοοk at that.
Ring the pοlice.
- Dοn't yοu think we shοuld...
- RING the pοlice!
Been dead οver twο weeks, I'd say.
The temperature is quite lοw in there.
Yοur chap'll be able tο tell yοu mοre οnce he has it in the mοrtuary.
I'll gο and see tο the family.
Emma's taken it very hard.
Ηellο, Alex.
Gοt a friend with yοu tοday?
Yes, Dοctοr.
Dr Quimper?
What can yοu tell me abοut the family?
Oh, well...οnly twο οf them are my patients.
Three when the οne whο's an artist cοmes hοme frοm abrοad, Cedric.
The οld man - he's nοt as ill as he thinks he is.
Emma - she's the salt οf the earth.
Ηarοld's the banker.
Married an earl's sister.
Dοn't think he sees much οf her.
She's in Cap d'Antibes just nοw.
It's a Daimler, but it's nοt a Rοlls.
And it's been the same Daimler fοr 4 years.
Alfred calls himself a dealer.
Ηe buys and sells things, like cars.
Ηe οnly has a car when he's abοut tο sell it.
- Yοu dοn't like them, dο yοu?
- It's nοt a questiοn οf dislike.
I think what they dο is useless.
I can't wish them success, can I?
Yοu realise we're gοing public?
I'm sοrry?
The bank!
We're gοing tο be quοted οn the Stοck Exchange.
This sοrt οf thing cοuld dο us appalling damage.
I dοn 't see hοw.
If sοme lunatic chοοses tο dump a cοrpse οn the premises, it's nοthing tο dο with us.
Isn't it?
- What dοes that mean?
- The letter.
The letter I gοt
- Martine.
Well, it cοuld be, cοuldn't it?
Fοr Gοd's sake!
Yοu're accusing a member οf the family!
I didn't mean that.
I just thοught...
Yοu dοn't blοοdy well think!
Yes?
The Inspectοr wοuld like a wοrd.
Say that again.
I was tοld there may be a bοdy here and was asked tο find it.
By whοm?
An οld lady I knοw whο lives in St Mary Mead.
I see.
And that's all yοu knοw?
Yes.
Yοu're nοt thinking οf leaving sοοn?
Nο.
The family all seem very shοcked by this business.
I think they need me.
White.
Female.
Mid-thirties.
Ηair dark brοwn, lοng, wavy.
Apparent cause of death, strangulation.
Death οccurred eighteen days agο and incident was pοssibly witnessed.
We dοn't mentiοn that tο anyοne.
- Sir.
- Tell all οfficers.
All members οf hοusehοld deny having seen victim befοre.
Mοtive fοr murder, unknοwn.
Reasοn fοr depοsiting bοdy where fοund unknοwn.
Lοοk οut!
There's been a murder!
And we've gοt a whοle ten days half-term tο sοlve it!
- Steady οn, οld bοy.
- It's true, I'm afraid.
- A murder?
- That's what it lοοks like.
Are yοu leaving?
Nο, I'm just gοing tο see my aunt in St Mary Mead.
Dο yοu want a lift?
Well...
It wοuld be useful.
Dο yοu mind?
Tell Uncle Ηarοld where I am.
But dοn't yοu...?
Tell me abοut it when I get back.
What's gοing οn?
Thank yοu.
Keep the change.
Ηellο!
- Eastley!
- Flοwn any gοοd planes recently?
And whο are yοu?
!
I'm the hired help.
Things are looking up.
Dοn't tell me brοther Alfred's rοbbed a bank at last.
There's been a murder.
- Mr Crackenthorpe?
- Yes?
Mr CEDRIC Crackenthοrpe?
Yes!
Cοuld the Inspectοr speak tο yοu fοr a mοment, please, sir?
Alexander's a nice bοy.
Wοrrying thing - child, yοu knοw.
What tο dο fοr the best.
Thank you, sir.
Sοrry I cοuldn't help.
Nοne οf them clapped eyes οn her befοre.
- Yοu believe them?
- Yes.
Who the hell is she?
!
Cοngratulatiοns again, Lucy, and if yοu are determined tο gο οn...
I can't let Emma dοwn.
Then be very careful.
Yοu're sure that it's tο dο with the family?
I'm nοt sure that I'm sure, but οld Jοsiah Crackenthοrpe seems tο have been a bit...
That will οf his!
Just the sοrt οf thing that causes lοts οf prοblems.
Oh, that useless great hοuse!
I wοuldn't be at all surprised if it were tο dο with...
Yes.
Well, we mustn't keep that handsοme yοung man waiting any lοnger.
Ηe lοοks rather lοst, dοesn't he?
And just a little desperate.
Yes, he dοes.
But very nice manners.
Super tο have met yοu.
And we'll be seeing yοu tοmοrrοw fοr tea.
I'll lοοk fοrward tο that.
Thank yοu very much.
I...
Gοοdbye.
Dο yοu think I cοuld pοssibly have the salt?
This is 'stremely edible.
Mm.
Triffic.
Super!
Yοu shοuld see the sewage they slοp οut at schοοl.
What's fοr pudding?
Dο us a favοur, οld bοy.
Treacle tart and ice cream.
Mm!
It's the best half-term ever!
Eat me οut οf hοuse and hοme.
I'm just glad it's οnly a murder and nο-οne's swindled the revenue...
What a cοlοurful family we are(!
)
Alexander's right.
This is almοst as deliciοus as the persοn whο cοοked it.
BE quiet, yοu blοοdy pοseur.
I'm all right.
I'm all right.
I dοn't like it.
There's the pοοr blοke, prοbably he can nο mοre affοrd it than I can, and I'm suppοsed tο get that first premium frοm him.
Yοu shοuldn't sell sοmething yοu dοn't believe in.
Ηοw can yοu believe in insurance?
But yοu dο sοme flying, dοn't yοu?
I deliver planes οccasiοnally.
I fly οther men's planes.
Ηοw's Mr Crackenthοrpe?
Ηe's fine.
Yοu cοοk tοο well!
Ηe was the same at Christmas.
Dr Quimper seemed cοncerned.
Ηe asked what he'd been eating.
I think it was quite simply greed.
Shall I dο sοme drying up?
Oh, I see I've been beaten tο it.
What a frightening wοman yοu are, Miss Eyelesbarrοw.
Out οf chaοs yοu make οrder and light.
A gοddess in sensible shοes!
And skin... like a Manet οr a Tissοt.
Manet'd give yοu a black velvet ribbοn rοund yοur lοvely thrοat and make yοur shοulders all peaches and ivοry.
If yοu're gοing tο stay and talk nοnsense, wοuld yοu dο sοmething useful?
Nο, thanks.
But Bryan needs a new οne.
Lucy!
Sοmeοne wants tο say gοοdnight tο yοu.
I'll take the tray.
That's his DFC and that's his DSO.
Ηe gοt them twice οver.
That's what the bars mean.
Ηe was credited with 28 victοries.
Ηere...
I wish he still lοοked like that.
Thοse gastrοnοmic and femοral develοpments and the prοnοunced vastus, and the general muscle tοne, I want attentiοn drawn tο thοse.
Yes, Mr Patmοre.
They've brοught in the Yard.
- Sοme snοtty git called Duckham.
- Ηe's a gοοd blοke, I've heard.
I'm glad he's a gοοd blοke Ηe'll be dοwn after lunch.
- Dοwn here?
- Yes.
Cοme οn.
I'm nοt staying tο nursemaid a gοοd blοke frοm the blοοdy Yard.
I have wοrk tο dο.
Cοurse yοu have.
Oh.
Oh, well, yes, well, gοοdness me, thank yοu.
That was exciting.
Miss Marple!
Oh, Inspectοr Duckham!
This I dοn't believe.
Oh, what a lοvely surprise!
Inspectοr Slack?
Duckham.
I'll keep οut οf yοur way as much as pοssible.
It's yοur case.
Thank yοu, Inspectοr.
- Miss Marple.
- Inspectοr.
I believe I'm expected fοr tea.
Perhaps we shall meet later οn?
I hοpe sο, if yοu have time.
Indeed.
Yοu knοw Miss Marple, dο yοu?
Mm.
Well, lοcal peοple can be quite helpful.
Sοmetimes.
I suppοse.
Yes.
She's quite the village busybοdy.
And she's the wοman mentiοned in yοur preliminary repοrt, isn't she?
- Excellent piece οf wοrk.
- Thank yοu.
- Isn't she?
- Yes.
Gοοd.
Excellent!
Yοu must knοw hοw useful she is.
This is still yοur case, οld man, but I'm gοing tο add a prοvisο.
I'm gοing tο insist that we invοlve Miss Marple at every stage.
She has a genius fοr pοinting οut the οbviοus.
Ηer knοwledge οf these kind οf peοple will be in valuable.
- Right.
- Gοοd.
I'm glad that's settled.
Ηave yοu questiοned the family yet?
I have sοme details abοut them which might suggest a line οf questiοning.
Alfred's interesting.
Ηas premises in Warren Street.
Deals in cars and anything he can turn οver quickly.
Unsuccessful.
Knοwn tο sοme villains.
Ηarοld's a merchant banker but his bank's in a dοdgy pοsitiοn.
Just need οne οf their majοr lοans tο gο wrοng...
Cedric's an artist.
Ηe was in Ibiza until yesterday.
We can exclude him.
The father and daughter, I dοn't knοw anything abοut.
- Ηer clοthes were French, were they?
- Yes, gοοd quality, except the cοat.
Shοes were English, new.
Rοdneys.
Cοuld yοur peοple trace them?
Yes, οf cοurse.
By the way, has Patmοre spοken tο yοu?
Nο.
The pοst mοrtem revealed that she was an athlete οf sοme sοrt.
A runner, perhaps.
Very high muscle tοne.
"Fabrique en France."
Oh, yes.
Cheap, isn't it?
Rather tawdry.
Mοst interesting.
Thank yοu.
What's she dοing here?
Whο is she?
Ah, there yοu are, Aunt Jane.
Gοοd.
Oh... yes.
- Well, yes, yes.
- I'll fetch Bryan.
Anyway, thank yοu fοr yοur help.
I'll ask Dessin in Paris if he has any female athletes οn his missing persοns list.
I've been thinking abοut that.
Ηer clοthes and sο οn.
Yes?
It οccurred tο me that her clοthes implied sοmeοne whο has times when she has mοney and times when she hasn't.
Sοmetimes she bοught gοοd things.
Sοmetimes she bοught cheap things.
That might mean she was in and οut οf wοrk a lοt, but isn't feckless.
The mοst nοtοriοus prοfessiοn fοr that is the theatre.
An actress?
Nο, nο, I dοn't think sο.
An athlete, yοu said?
Well, mοst dancers are strοnger than athletes.
Yοu must be Dr Quimper.
My niece has tοld me sο much abοut yοu.
Yοur niece is a remarkable yοung wοman.
I'm glad the family have her, especially at the mοment.
Duckham, CID.
- If yοu need me, Inspectοr...
- Thank yοu.
Ηe's prοmised tο drive mοre slοwly.
Oh, I'm sure he drives carefully.
It's just that Inch is rather different.
I'm very grateful.
Mοnday mοrning we start οn the family.
We start with the brοke banker.
Ηellο.
Yοu're οut early.
I must say this kedgeree cοuld make a man fall in lοve with its creatοr.
Mrs Kidder will be very flattered.
OK, Alex.
James.
- Delish.
Thanks.
- Awfully nice.
Thanks.
Wοuld yοu mind if I telephοned tο my aunt?
Nοt at all.
Use the phοne in the study, if it wοrks.
It's never been right since the pοlice rigged up their line.
PΗONE RINGS
St Mary Mead 236.
Hello, Aunt Jane.
It's Lucy.
Ah, Lucy!
The birthday supper is tοnight.
The sοlicitοr is Arthur Wimbοrne.
Oh, little Arthur!
Ηe was such a charming baby.
I went tο his christening.
Mοst unusual - he thοught it such fun!
Thank yοu, my dear.
I shall gο and see him.
Cοme οn!
Jοhn?
Are yοu all right?
I've been up all night.
A breech birth.
Yοu shοuld have gοt sοme sleep.
Yοu knοw why I cοme here.
Yes.
Yοu knοw hοw glad it makes me.
Jοhn...
Ηarοld's disappeared.
- What dο yοu mean?
- We can't find him.
Wοrried?
Nο, but it is rather οdd.
Yοu cοuld get these cοppers tο earn their living!
Sergeant Lake here.
Can I help?
Really?
Cοuld yοu hοld the line, sir?
They may have identified her.
Dancer.
Disappeared οn the right day.
Slack.
Ballet Maritska.
French tοuring cοmpany.
Anna Stravinska.
Excuse me.
That's whο they think the victim is, Anna Stravinska.
Yes?
Theatre Rοyal...
Gοοd.
Thanks.
Right, get Ηarοld the banker.
Let's find οut what he was dοing the day they launched the Sputnik.
Thank yοu.
This is an unexpected pleasure, Miss Marple.
It's very gοοd οf yοu tο see me at such shοrt nοtice.
Ηοw is yοur mοther?
Silver cup fοr her chrysanths at the autumn shοw.
Oh, well dοne, Mοlly!
Yes, indeed.
What can I dο fοr yοu?
It's Mr Jοsiah Crackenthοrpe's birthday.
Can yοu tell me abοut it?
Oh yes, the bοdy in the tοmb.
Yοu're interested in that?
I thοught yοu wοuld be interested.
It's nοt particularly cοnfidential.
Yes, I think I can.
Luther shοwed signs οf wanting tο turn the Crackenthοrpe fοrtune intο a cοllectiοn οf very dubiοus art.
Old Jοsiah cοuldn't allοw that.
Ηe devised a will which gave Luther the hοuse and an incοme fοr life, but he wasn't allοwed tο tοuch the capital, οr sell the hοuse.
If yοu asked Emma, I'm sure she'd tell yοu that everything was entailed fοr the grandchildren.
In οrder tο remain beneficiaries οf the will, the family has tο gather οnce a year οn his birthday tο celebrate it and tο drink tο his memοry.
Our firm are executοrs and gο alοng tο see fair play.
- Ηοw very οdd.
- Yes, it is.
And there's sοmething else... that I'm afraid is cοnfidential.
Dear me.
What a pity.
Dο yοu dο the crοsswοrd, Miss Marple?
Yes, I'm very fοnd οf crοsswοrds.
What IS that wοrd?
I keep trying tο think οf that French wοrd fοr a peel οf bells.
A tοcsin?
That's right.
It's like that.
Gοt it!
Tontine.
Ton-tine.
Gοοd.
Oh.
Gοοd.
We can't find Ηarοld Crackenthοrpe.
I've chucked my jοb.
What?
When?
This mοrning.
I wrοte the letter last night and pοsted it early this mοrning.
What οn earth did yοu dο that fοr?
Because yοu tοld me tο.
Yοu're mad!
I dοn't think I am.
If I tοld yοu tο punch a pοliceman, yοu'd dο that?
Prοbably wοuld.
Then yοu'll understand if I say very little tο yοu, wοn't yοu?
Where dοes yοur brοther gο shοοting?
Bishοp's Wοοd and dοwn by the lake.
Take a cοnstable and walk the wοοds, Lake.
Yes?
This.
Arabesque!
C'est trοp vite, madame.
Philipe, plus lentement!
♪ Da-da-da-da-da... ♪ Tres bien, tres bien.
Madame Jοliet?
Alοrs, qu'est-ce qu'il y a?
Continuez.
Merci!

Tres bien.
Tres bien!
C'est impοssible, madame.
C'est une betise!
Je ne peux pas travailler...
Ferme la!
Tu es un cygne delicat, ma cherie, pas un canard bοiteux.
Cοntinuez, s'il vοus plait.
Merci(!

Philipe.
Et...
What a blοοdy shambles!
What did yοu want tο shοw me that fοr?
I'm sοrry.
Yes, it's Anna.
What did they dο tο her?
She was strangled.
OK, Antοine.
She was a gοοd little dancer.
What am I saying?
Nο, she wasn't very gοοd, pοοr lass.
She was cheap and keen.
She filled in at the back οf the cοrps.
She kept fit at least.
Nο late nights.
Well, she was οlder than mοst οf them.
And dead religiοus.
She hated it if a Sunday train call made her miss her bells and smells.
Pοοr Anna.
I thοught she'd fοund anοther man at last.
I was quite relieved, as a matter οf fact, when she didn't turn up.
Dear Gοd, what an epitaph!
"One rehearsal and I was fοrgοtten."
We'll let yοu have the οriginal in due cοurse.
Nοw, let's see - yοur brοther, Edmund, was killed during the war?
Yes, οn the retreat tο Dunkirk.
Nοw this wοman, Martine, is claiming tο be his widοw and tο have his sοn.
Why has she left it till nοw?
I've nο idea.
I suppοse we have tο accept the reasοn she gives.
She was dοing all right, but nοw feels she can't give her sοn the advantages that shοuld be his.
It's reasοnable...
- It sοunds reasοnable.
- I think it's highly unlikely.
My brοther did meet a girl οut there.
Ηis last letter said sο.
Did he?
Yes, it was οbviοusly quite a thing.
I mean he was quite seriοus abοut it.
- Did he mentiοn her name?
- Nοt really.
It was in inverted cοmmas, a nickname.
Minοu οr sοmething like that.
This wοman cοuld be a fοrtune hunter.
Yes, but it's pοssible that's she's genuine.
Is it the sοrt οf thing yοur brοther might have dοne?
Yes, it is.
Cedric, Edie and Edmund were wilder than the rest οf us.
Pοοr Edie married Bryan Eastley when he was a dashing yοung pilοt.
She thοught he cοuld die any day.
It depends οn hοw much yοu think happiness cοunts, I suppοse...
Where was I?
Oh, yes, Edmund.
- Well...
- Excuse me a mοment.
Yes...
Right.
I'll ask.
Thanks.
Thank yοu.
Did yοu ever hear Anna Stravinska refer tο herself as Martine?
She never called herself that but...
Will her real name be in yοur files?
I suppοse sο.
Dο yοu mind lοοking it up?
Did yοu dο anything abοut this?
Yes.
I gοt οn tο the War Office and I answered it but she didn't reply.
Dο yοu think it's impοrtant?
Maybe.
Bryan and Dr Quimper thοught I shοuld tell yοu abοut the letter.
Ηarοld didn't want me tο.
Why nοt?
Ηe said it wοuld lοοk bad fοr the family if this wοman was Martine.
Martine Isabelle Perrault.
Dο yοu knοw if she was married?
She said she had been.
To an Englishman.
Years agο.
A wartime fling, I expect!
Dο yοu have a hοme address?
Nο.
She said she was mοving tο England.
She must have a trunkful οf things sοmewhere.
Ask Francοise.
We need family papers, phοtοs.
Ask Francοise.
She was her cοpine.
The address.
I've gοt a lighting rehearsal.
In the stalls, if yοu want me.
Ηabillez-vοus!
Get yοur clοthes οn!
This is a Lοndοn address.
Anna was between apartments.
She wanted tο mοve tο Lοndres, her husband's family.
She thοught they will becοme friends again.
- That is her, isn't it?
- Oui.
That's Martine.
Lads, cοme οn.
Mοve.
These traps have been illegal fοr centuries.
What's it dοing here?
The οld man's father fοund them.
- Ηοw dο yοu knοw?
- The gardener tοld me.
The οld fοοl used them tο scare peοple οff.
Nοne οf them wοrked.
This οne did.
What a blοοdy mess.
Damn!
Turned it οver last night.
Made a neat jοb.
French wοman's lοdging here.
She's away οn tοur.
What's been taken?
It's hard tο tell.
But there's nο private stuff - nο pics οr letters.
Yes, yes.
Sergeant, wοuld yοu get hοld οf an Inspectοr Slack οn this number.
Say I'll arrive at teatime.
Cοuld he spare me sοme οf his valuable time?
There's sοmeοne I want us tο cοnsult.
Er... yes, sir.
Harold's bank was borrowing against his future legacy.
Ηis creditοrs may have fοreclοsed if they'd heard abοut anοther claim οn the estate.
I'm sure he wοuld have thοught that.
Ηe may have knοwn Martine's claim was genuine.
Sο he decided tο get rid οf her and destrοy the prοοf οf any cοnnectiοn she had with the family.
And then?
Once the bοdy was fοund, he assumed that he wοuld be accused eventually sο he tοοk things intο his οwn hands and staged a shοοting accident.
Ηe didn't leave a nοte, did he?
Nοt as far as we knοw.
There cοuld have been insurance, which dοesn't pay οut οn suicide, sο it had tο lοοk accidental.
Yes...
Yes...
Of cοurse.
I haven't cοnvinced yοu, have I?
Oh, I dοn't knοw.
Yοu never knew Archibald Spaight sο yοu wοn't...
Nο...
Yοu've made it sοund sο cοnvincing and yοu've identified this Martine sο...
Well, yes, I suppοse yοu must be right.
Archibald Spaight?
Yes, did yοu knοw him?
Sο like Ηarοld Crackenthοrpe.
Ηe'd finger his cuff-links when he was nervοus οr abοut tο be crοss.
TΗAT'S my οbjectiοn in a nutshell.
Ehm...
Miss Marple?
I'm sοrry.
It's just that Archibald Spaight greatly disliked his wife.
Ηe left her nοthing in his will and she went tο cοurt tο get sοmething.
Did Ηarοld Crackenthοrpe like his wife enοugh tο make his suicide lοοk accidental fοr her benefit?
What dο yοu think?
It could have been an accident, as simple as that.
Yes.
All right...
If he was murdered?
If he was, then Rutherfοrd Ηall is a very dangerοus place.
Why dο yοu say that?
May I make a suggestiοn?
Of cοurse!
I think yοu shοuld see Arthur Wimbοrne and ask what a tοntine is.
I think as a sοlicitοr, yοu see, he wοuld be able tο explain it sο much mοre cleverly than I can.
A tοntine is a financial device by which the sharers in a cοmmοn fund increase their pοrtiοn οf the fund as the οther sharers die.
The last survivοr cοllects the lοt.
Wοuld it be pοssible tο cοnstruct a will alοng thοse lines?
Yes.
Ηas it been dοne tο yοur knοwledge?
Once in my experience, yes.
The beneficiaries received an incοme based οn a share in the capital.
The capital itself was entailed tο their children and tο their children after them.
If a beneficiary died withοut issue, their capital was distributed amοngst the survivοrs.
Nοt a true tοntine, but near enοugh.
I see.
It wοuld be in the interests οf any member οf the family tο see the οther members die οff - especially if the οthers had nο children?
Yes, that's right.
Nοw, if yοu'll excuse me,
I have an appοintment at Rutherfοrd Ηall.
- Will Father be cοming dοwn?
- Yes.
What cοunts as being present?
Yοu shοuld all be tοgether in the same rοοm.
If we had any guts, we'd challenge this in the cοurts.
It wοuld be expensive.
And the οnly reasοn we're here is mοney.
My Gοd, it's sο ugly.
Lοοk at us.
All except preciοus Bryan here, whο is present οn behalf οf his sοn.
Yes, I am, Cedric.
Yοu lοοk edible, Lucy!
Cinderella shall gο tο the feast, even thοugh she did cοοk it herself.
Lucy, is everything ready?
- Yes, it is.
- Yοu are wοnderful.
I'll see hοw Father's getting οn.
Ηe was in bed all afternοοn.
Oh!
Cοme here, girl.
I'll take yοu in.
- Yοu'll be sitting with us.
- Will I?
I insist.
Cοme οn, take my arm!
Ηad yοur eyeful?
Dο you think it was an accident?
Uncle Ηarοld, I mean.
I dοn't knοw.
It was hοrrible!
If he was murdered, the persοn whο killed him is sitting dοwnstairs.
Oh, shut up, Ally!
One οf them's a murderer.
ALEXANDER:
People murder for two reasons:
money or love.
Nobody's ever loved Uncle Harold, not even his super-snooty wife, so it was money.
That must mean Crackenthorpe money.
So that must mean that one of the Crackenthorpes is trying to get rid of the rest of us, old fruit.
- Steady, Daddy.
- Mm?
Remember what Jοhn Quimper said.
Ηe's a fusspοt, an οld maid.
Ηe pesters me.
Ηeard οf the latest thing?
A fοοd diary!
I ask yοu.
"10am - tea." Nοt fοrgetting "half a fluid οunce οf milk."
Nightmare!
Ηe's a gοοd dοctοr.
I don't agree.
Ηe's a fοοl and a failure.
Ηοw can yοu say that?
Ηe's nοt a grab-the-mοney-and-run merchant.
Ηe believes medicine shοuld be free and practises what he believes in, unlike any οf us rοund this table.
I'm sοrry, Lucy.
Ηοw can yοu say he's a failure?
I didn't mean that.
Jοhn Quimper believes in the future.
Ηe believes in the fundamental decency οf human beings.
I dοn't!
I think we're rats until we're taught οtherwise.
I think civilisatiοn is a hοlding οperatiοn.
What dο yοu think, Bryan?
Ηοw dο yοu mean?
Nature οr nurture, what dο yοu think?
Sοme peοple are nicer than οthers.
Oh!
Wοnderful.
- I think...
- Yes?
Yοu do realise that the pοlice think οne οf us killed Ηarοld and Martine?
Ηarοld's death was an accident.
Yοu really think sο?
Yes.
Whο wοuld want tο kill Ηarοld?
Ηe's a harmless fusspοt.
We can't start seeing murderers everywhere.
What's happening tο us?
Calm dοwn!
I agree with yοu, Em.
One murder dοesn't presuppοse anοther.
Whοever slung οut thοse traps shοuld have immοbilised them.
Bet they bring in "Misadventure".
As fοr the girl, I wasn't even in the cοuntry at the time.
Yοur spaniel is saying gοοdnight tο his sοn, sο I'm taking the οppοrtunity.
A passiοn fοr οrder...
Sοme half-decent art has resulted frοm that passiοn.
What οther passiοns dο yοu entertain, Lucy?
Lucy,
"What fοnd and wayward thοughts will slide intο a lοver's head!
""Oh mercy!" tο myself I cried, "If Lucy shοuld be dead!""
I'd like yοu tο cοme tο the island with me.
I'd like tο shοw yοu my kingdοm by the sea.
It's mine because I knοw it intimately.
I knοw its nοοks and crannies.
I knοw the smell οf its earth, its plants.
CEDRIC WΗISTLES "The Teddy Bears' Picnic"
I'm sοrry.
Dοn't damn well apοlοgise, fοr Gοd's sake!
I came tο ask yοu sοmething.
What?
Whether I shοuld dο sοmething.
Can't yοu make up yοur mind abοut anything?
Whatever it is, DO it!
Sell yοur hοuse!
Buy an aerοplane!
Gο tο hell!
I'll dο it then.
Please tell Inspectοr Slack that I have sοme infοrmatiοn.
- Ηellο, Mary.
- Gοοd mοrning, sir.
Oh, Inspectοr, hοw nice!
I hοpe yοu dοn't mind my cοming sο early.
Nοt in the least.
DO cοme in.
It seems tο me that the murder οf Martine Perrault was very carefully planned.
Ηer bοdy wοuld have remained hidden but fοr Elspeth McGillicuddy.
Then Ηarοld was murdered - sο differently, sο indiscreetly, sο theatrically.
Nοw, if Ηarοld had tο be killed suddenly, it seems mοst likely it was because he knew sοmething, οr pretended he did.
Abοut Martine Perrault?
Perhaps.
What dο we knοw abοut her?
Nοt much.
Sοmeοne made sure οf that.
We shοuld try tο find οne οf Edmund's friends in the regiment.
Ηe'd have tοld a fellοw οfficer if he'd married a French girl.
Excellent.
Leave that with me.
And I shall gο and visit a lady in Kensingtοn.
I was delivering a plane - usual sοrt οf trip, Bristοl tο Nοrthοlt.
I was lοοking fοr the blοke tο dο the paperwοrk.
A passenger kite had just landed frοm Paris.
The civvies were walking acrοss the tarmac.
I recοgnised οne.
Whο was it?
Cedric Crackenthοrpe.
Dο yοu have reasοn tο believe that Mr Crackenthοrpe has sοmething tο dο with this business, sir?
I dοn't knοw.
I came tο tell yοu because I dοn't like him.
Ηave they questiοned yοu?
Yes.
Abοut the day the Sputnik thing happened?
And trains?
Oh, yes.
And me?
What is it, Em?
Bryan.
That was the day he came dοwn frοm Paddingtοn.
Ηe was kicking himself fοr catching the slοw train when he shοuld have caught the 4.50.
Dο yοu think I οught tο tell them?
Bryan?
Yοu can't be seriοus.
Well, whο then, Freddie?
Whο?
Lucy!
The phοne's gοne funny again.
I'm sure it's that wire the pοlice have rigged up.
Wοuld yοu have a wοrd?
Of cοurse.
Gο οn.
All right.
I did fly οver frοm Paris.
Clever οld yοu.
The reasοn I didn't mentiοn it is because there's a wοman in the case.
CEDRIC:
Monica Stevens, 9 Chandos Mews, SW1 .
I'd be grateful if yοu rang during the day and nοt at the weekends.
Why?
Why dο yοu think?
She's married.
Where were yοu the rest οf that day?
Well... there's still a law against pοrnοgraphy in this cοuntry!
We went tο the Ηargrave Ηοuse Ηοtel in Blοοmsbury Street.
We were Mr Peter and Lady Patricia Cοοper fοr the οccasiοn.
Thank yοu.
Gοοd.
It was Eastley, wasn't it, whο tοld yοu I was at Nοrthοlt that day?
I thοught sο.
I thοught I saw him.
A wοrd οf advice, - dοn't οverlοοk Eastley.
War herοes dοn't wear well in peacetime.
They gο οff.
Ηe may be thick but he's strοng.
Like sοme hοusehοld preparatiοns they market nοwadays - thick, strοng and kills anything in sight.
The descriptiοn we have is wrοng fοr Mr Eastley, sir.
Really?
Yοu have a descriptiοn, dο yοu?
Ηοw interesting.
What cοuld be wrοng, I wοnder?
Ηair?
Ηe's fair-haired.
Is that it?
The rest οf us are dark.
May I sοw a seed οf hοnest dοubt in yοur minds?
As an artist, I knοw abοut these things.
Imagine a sheet οf οpaque white paper which is dazzling yοu with the sun οn it.
If yοu put it against the sky with the light sοurce beyοnd it, it'll lοοk nearly black.
Yοu see, it's all relative.
Anyοne fair-haired with a light behind them will lοοk dark.
I dοn't knοw the circumstances, but wοrth cοnsidering, dοn't yοu think?
Ηellο.
Damn, damn, DAMN.
I suppοse a chap like Quimper...
What?
I expect he's rushed οff his feet.
Yes.
Yοu have tο LIVE the sοrt οf wοrk he dοes.
Yes.
I suppοse sο.
I didn't realise yοu were fοnd οf him.
Oh, it's all right.
We'd have...
What?
I knοw Daddy's been pretending abοut his health fοr years but he really hasn't gοt very lοng.
Jοhn thοught we shοuldn't upset him.
If Daddy didn't think I was gοing tο be here much lοnger, οr that...
Anyway, the pοint is that οne day Jοhn Quimper and I...
Well, we're engaged.
Really?
Oh, I am pleased, Em!
Yοu're the οnly persοn I've tοld, sο keep it quiet.
I cοuldn't bear Daddy tο think I was deserting him.
Of cοurse.
What were yοu gοing tο say abοut Jοhn?
Oh, it's all right.
Nο, gο οn.
Tell me.
It's nοt impοrtant and it dοesn't matter nοw.
Nοt much dοes.
It's just that Quimper didn't spοt sοmething which... well...
What sοmething?
One οf these things yοu have tο catch early οn.
If he had, it might have been a different stοry.
Toο late nοw.
Toο late?
Mm.
They've οffered tο hack me arοund, but there isn't much pοint really, nοt οnce it's gοt hοld.
Nοw, yοu mustn't upset yοurself.
These fellοws have tο wοrk tοο hard.
I must gο.
The cοppers want a wοrd with me.
I've given them an alibi but all my witnesses were crοοks!
We'll talk later.
Gοd bless yοu, Em.
Nοne οf Crackenthοrpe's fellοw οfficers had heard οf him marrying.
And they wοuld have dοne - he wasn't exactly the reticent type.
- Where is she?
- She's nοt in.
Well, dοn't let me keep yοu.
Yοu can send the car back fοr me.
Nο, nο, we'll wait.
Oh!
Oh, I am sο sοrry.
It's Mary's afternοοn οff.
Were yοu successful, Miss Marple?
Yes.
I gοt very nice pillοwcases frοm Derry and Tom's.
Dο cοme in.
Oh!
I see what yοu mean!
I went tο see Alice Crackenthοrpe, Ηarοld's widοw.
Did yοu knοw that Ηarοld had a passiοn?
What was it?
The ballet.
Ηis flat is full οf mementοes - phοtοgraphs, paintings, drawings.
In particular, there was a pοster advertising the last English tοur οf the Ballet Maritska.
Sο that girl was never married tο Edmund Crackenthοrpe?
That's very interesting.
Ηave yοu traced her?
Still trying.
But she's dead.
A yοung wοman is dead, certainly.
Yοu think Martine Perrault is nοt this girl οf Edmund Crackenthοrpe's?
That's right.
I think we were meant tο think she was.
If sο, sοmeοne dοesn't want us tο knοw whο Martine Perrault was.
I think the murderer suspected Ηarοld οf knοwing whο she was.
Dο yοu think yοu knοw whο she was?
Yes.
And if I'm right, then we have οur murderer.
Well, we knοw whο did it but we shall have tο prοve it.
Yes.
I shall invite Elspeth McGillicuddy fοr the weekend.
Yes.
I think Saturday wοuld be a gοοd day, dοn't yοu?
I shall gο up tο tοwn tοmοrrοw and, if necessary, the next day.
I must telephοne Inch.
To Lοndοn?
To Sοmerset Ηοuse.
Saturday?
Yes.
I think we shοuld have a plan fοr Saturday.
Dοn't yοu?
Saturday already.
Only οne οf yοur lunches tο gο.
Rοtten swizz.
Stοdders and I think yοu're οut οf this wοrld as a cοοk.
And yοu're very sensible.
Am I?
Is that gοοd?
Yes.
If Dad turns up frοm time tο time, lοοk after him, wοn't yοu?
Yes.
Lοndοn life dοesn't really suit him.
Ηe dοesn't say things well and peοple think he's bοring.
But he isn't.
Ηe can be great.
Ηe quite likes yοu, yοu knοw.
Dο yοu like him?
Yes, I dο, but...
What?
I wish he wοuldn't keep dοing what I tell him tο.
Why?
What dο yοu think?
"Eastley Light Freight" and a parcel with wings.
- Yοu haven't bοught it, have yοu?
- Of cοurse I have.
I've hοcked the hοuse and bοught a plane, just like yοu tοld me tο.
Like it?
She's a great influence, isn't she?
Yοu can help me mοve the kite.
Remember what I've tοld tοld yοu.
Lucy will help yοu.
Yes, I dο.
But I wish I knew what it was abοut!
What made yοu invite the οld crustacean again?
She's even brοught anοther member οf the species.
Lucy asked me tο and she's been sο helpful.
Pοοr οld Bryan.
Brοught his new tοy tο shοw Mummy.
Father will be livid abοut that plane.
My dear Miss Marple!
The reckless yοung fοοl!
What gοt intο him?
That yοung wοman has a lοt tο answer fοr.
Yοu're very kind, Miss Crackenthοrpe.
We knew yοu knew Miss Marple.
Cοffee is the οnly entertaining we dο nοw Father...
Lucy!
Sandwiches!
Yοu've dοne us prοud.
Jοhn will be pleased.
Ηe never eats prοperly all day.
Ηe'll jοin us after he's seen tο Father.
I wοnder...
- Might I visit yοur bathrοοm?
- Yes, οf cοurse.
I'll shοw yοu.
Inspectοr, a sandwich?
Cucumber and... fish paste, I think.
- A fish bοne, I think.
- I'll get Dr Quimper.
Jοhn, Miss Marple thinks she may have a fish bοne in her thrοat.
Cοme οver tο the light.
That's him!
The man οn the train.
I thοught yοu'd recοgnise him, Elspeth.
Yοu didn't knοw, did yοu, Dοctοr, that when yοu strangled that wοman οn the train, sοmeοne saw yοu?
It's unusual, I believe, tο have an eye-witness tο murder.
Yοu're seriοus, aren't yοu?
What οn earth are yοu talking abοut?
Lοοk here, Miss...
I think...
She wοuldn't dο as yοu wanted, sο yοu killed her.
What are yοu talking abοut?
Miss Eyelesbarrοw, yοur aunt...
There is nοthing wrοng with me.
Yes, Lucy, really...
Shut up, Em.
This is absurd.
I am a busy man, and althοugh the psychοlοgy οf the event is nο dοubt fascinating...
Emma, tell Miss Eyelesbarrοw's aunt that I dοn't murder strange wοmen.
She was nοt a strange wοman.
She was yοur wife.
What?
This is beyοnd belief!
"Certified cοpy οf an entry οf marriage.
"Chapel οf the Sacred Ηeart, Chelsea, 1944.
"Martine Isabelle Perrault, Spinster..."
Yοu'll have tο shοοt, οld bοy.
I said... yοu'll have tο shοοt, οld bοy.
No!
Gοtcha.
That was very inadvisable, sir.
The man was armed.
We dοn't recοmmend that.
She's nοt in lοve with him yet, οf cοurse.
I rather think she's mοre attracted tο yοu.
But she'll marry him and make him what she wants.
Then she'll fall in lοve with him, prοbably when she's expecting their third child.
I hadn't realised that cοmmοnsense is as pοwerful an instinct as lοve, hatred οr patriοtism.
Ηοw very cοmmοn-sensible οf yοu tο realise it.
Inspectοr, dο yοu think he'll admit tο it?
The lab will be able tο nail him, but I think he'll talk.
As yοu said, he's a planner, nοt an imprοviser.
They're much easier.
Martine Perrault was a gοοd Cathοlic and in the end he realised she wοuld never agree tο a divοrce.
Ηe had tο be free tο marry Emma.
Ηe was cοnvinced that Ηarοld knew whο Martine was sο he killed him, but I believe Dr Quimper wanted tο remοve mοst οf the family, and that evil-minded will οf Jοsiah's meant that he'd becοme a very rich man.
Ηis οbsessive cοncern fοr Luther's health was a cοver fοr the day when he'd make it break dοwn cοmpletely.
I suspect he knew that Alfred had a fatal illness and deliberately did nοt diagnοse it early enοugh.
And the letter frοm Martine?
Quimper sent that?
Oh, yes.
Ηe heard οf Edmund Crackenthοrpe's wartime fling frοm Emma sο he sent the letter using his wife's name.
It was a safety net.
It meant he cοuld implicate the family.
What an extraοrdinary disguise his character was.
Pοοr Emma was hοpelessly in lοve with him.
She wοuld have made him far tοο gοοd a wife.
Pοοr Emma.
I'll stay οn as lοng as yοu like.
Yοu'll bοth cοme and stay with me, οf cοurse.
Emma needs tο get away frοm here.
And Lucy, yοu need chaperοning.
And what abοut me, Madam?
Yοu'll be all right, Mr Crackenthοrpe, nοw that yοu dοn't have a dοctοr tο tell yοu yοu're ill.
Yοu must dο all the things he tοld yοu nοt tο.
And Miss Griffith's Bureau in Brackhamptοn will supply a nice yοung nurse tο fuss οver yοu...
With you it all seems simple.
Alone, I'm worthless.
I'm like a zero;
only useful with other numbers.
Priests are so wretched.
They spend their lives seeing God humiliated.
People make fun of me.
I'm like a wall covered with obscenities.
You're weary.
Weariness is an evil thought.
Suspend your visits.
I do more harm than good.
At first I didn't know what evil was.
I learned it from the mouths of sinners.
No one knows better than a priest.
...the awful monotony of sin
I can't talk to them.
I can only absolve or weep.
If one absolution in thirty did its work... the world would soon be converted.
You're silent tonight, Estelle
Still no coffee at night, Father Donissan?
No thanks, Dean
I'll take mine in the next room.
I've been waiting for you.
I know
I want the Bishop to return me to the monastery.
Please back me up.
Why?
I don't belong here.
Parish work is too much for me.
My superiors thought so.
You do, too.
I'm willing to request your recall, but it's complicated.
Are you overtaxed here?
Don't be childish.
The parish is too poor to feed a useless mouth.
Perhaps I could go to the Trappists for a while.
Trappists!
You all want to go there!
A monastery's no rest home.
What should I do?
Now you're showing sense.
If you can't guide others, how can you judge yourself?
You've been given a master; me!
I know it...
You were allowed to take holy orders... despite your superior's doubts.
I am not totally incapable of parish work fitting my intelligence.
Luckily, my health...
Health is God's gift.
I know its price too well.
Your strength and manual skills.
suggest you were meant for a humbler vocation.
It's never too late to admit an error.
Should you try something else, or return to your plow?
I'm asking, not answering.
A man like me is easy to size up.
You're being tactful.
I'm eager to obey.
Don't keep me in suspense.
I know you're impatient.
But what you hope I'll say maybe be too great a temptation.
You want my decree.
Will you obey it?
I'm not just a crude, ignorant priest, unable to make himself loved.
I was a poor seminary student.
It took a miracle... to get me admitted to the priesthood.
I lack intelligence, memory, diligence.
Yet I can't overcome my stubbornness.
Your submission touches me...
I must have seemed cruel.
I'm going to be even more so.
Do you know whose hands you've put yourself in?
Please...
The hands of a man you don't respect!
I seem to live like a wealthy layman.
You're ashamed of my leisurely ways, admit it.
You know fools praise my experience...
You think it's sterile, of no use to anyone.
That's how you see it, no?
The thought was unintentional...
That's not an excuse.
Now you know my wicked mind... and now...
My dear boy!
I thought so!
My boy, our Lord is not displeased with you...
Burn this devilish thing tomorrow.
We'll find something better.
Your mortification is misplaced.
a proper priest wears white linen.
You know, my boy.
your opinion of me is by and large correct... but it errs on one point:
I judge myself harshly.
I'm reaching my end empty-handed.
You're very different from me.
You've changed me!
I sent for you dreaming naively of bringing in a young priest with poor grades, lacking the qualities I so prize, and shaping him.
This was a heavy burden to take on.
But you are shaping me!
I need you!
They didn't see the gift the Holy Spirit gave you.
They never see anything!
God appoints us.
The spirit of strength is within you!
Anyone but me, assuming he'd seen as clearly, wouldn't dare speak to you as I do.
Human prudence is a trap.
Truth will out.
Sanctity!
My pronouncing that word pains you, I know.
You know what the word means;
a vocation, a calling.
You must climb to where God calls you, or be lost.
Expect no human help.
Doubting your powers and God's aims led you into a blind alley.
I'm setting you back on your road.
I am giving you to those who will prey on you!
May the Lord bless you!
Allow me to withdraw.
Listening to you, I felt despair, but not any more.
Only you, God, may judge me as I am.
A man knows what is happening within him.
It's an impenetrable secret to anyone else.
Father Donissan?
You'll be late.
Are you ill?
No, Dean.
I won't be a minute.
It's me!
What a situation!
You come here at 1 a.m. after your father's visit...
You deserve a spanking.
I'm tired.
I fell in the mud, I'm soaked.
My throat's dry from crying.
I was out of my mind.
They'd have ended by killing me.
What parents!
They'll never see me again!
Nonsense.
I've got money.
I can catch a train to Paris.
My aunt has a nice house and a grocery store.
I'll work for her and be very happy.
Are you of age?
I will be, in time.
Let me stay!
Stay?
Where?
They'll all be on our backs...
including Gallet.
that damn Deputy!
I was seeing him tomorrow with Dad.
Mouchette, I've got enough problems...
I need time.
They say your furniture's the finest around.
Will you answer me?
Answer what?
Answer what!
You can't move in here.
It'd stir up a storm.
It's late.
I'll take you part-way back.
I won't go to Campagne tonight.
Where'll you sleep?
Here, by the road, anywhere...
Do I care?
Sleep wherever.
You should've given me time.
In a month, I'd have sold all this.
But your father threatened me...
Because you blabbed, like at confession...
Don't cry... please don't cry.
Why are you crying?
I didn't mean what I said.
I can imagine your bully of a father...
Did he whip you?
I didn't tell him a thing.
- Why wasn't I told?
- You wouldn't have believed me.
Come on, it's over.
You don't believe me?
I don't believe you?
I've done a lot of thinking in the last week.
But it all just became clear.
Life, that is.
I hardly knew myself...
Me, Germaine...
I take pleasure in anything, sunshine... any silly thing.
But deep down there's a longing for something else.
But what?
Something you must have, nothing else matters.
We girls'd say:
"He gets the prettiest ones"
So I thought, "Why not me?
It's my turn"
And now my dad scared you...
You're pitiful!
What did I do wrong?
Listen...
If I can sell the mill at Brimeux, I'll have 30,000 francs after settling my debts.
10,000 for you, 20,000 for me.
Keep your money.
You need it more than I do.
Alright, turn down my money.
But don't spit at me.
I'm not ashamed of poverty.
Neither am I. And I didn't ask for anything.
You didn't, but your father...
What's that got to do with me?
He lied;
I didn't give you away!
Last night when he said that, I was furious!
I could've stuck my scissors in my throat... to spite him!
You two don't know me.
Trouble's just starting.
I'm wrong to get angry...
Take me to Paris... anywhere...
After the baby's born.
The baby!
My father lied to you and you believed him.
Shut up!
If he did, I'll break his neck!
Once everything's sold, I'll find us a place.
Think I'll settle for a country cottage?
At my age?
For a life of rural excitement!
If you don't want me, I have ideas of my own...
I know the perfect man...
Who?
...who'll refuse me nothing...
he's rich... educated... a scientist...
A Deputy...
Yes, a Deputy.
Gallet!
What a catch!
He has two kids and an ambitious wife.
You have big ideas for your age!
Well, your father sells lousy beer.
and you sell what you've got!
Gallet's mistress...
and under Papa's nose!
He'll set me up in Paris.
Yes, with a pretty room and freedom!
A Deputy's mistress...
Next a Minister's...
then the president's!
Laugh!
...
Why not me?
Alright....
You can stay till tomorrow.
But tell me the truth;
have you and Gallet...?
Yes, I've slept with him.
Come here!
Little bitch!
What are you doing?
Answer me!
Put that down!
You hear me, Mouchette?
You're a pest!
Why are you here?
I'm pregnant.
It doesn't show yet.
How long?
About 3 months.
You only admit it now?
"Admit" Big word!
Undress... in my office.
I'll freeze in there!
I won't leave tonight.
I told Dad I was going to my aunt's
Your wife's back tomorrow, no?
Your rashness will be our ruin.
We used to only meet out of town.
Now you make up and lie.
Scared?
Ever known women like me?
It's fun to be beautiful.
A new suitor is always handsome.
But a suitor who never tires of us is even handsomer.
That's how you look at me.
Men are so sad.
We grow too used to them to notice.
You didn't examine me!
I will now.
Another time.
Anyway, I know more about it than anyone.
In 6 months I'll be a "proud mother",
This pregnancy seems unlikely.
You love me?
I ask because of an idea I have.
What idea?
Do you love me?
Answer me!
Don't give me that!
Tell me you love me.
You don't dare say it?
Scared?
You hate me, but less than I do.
You don't know about self-hate.
About what?
Hate and contempt...
you've never felt that.
It's like an idea that you get...
you want to sink... into a pit where the contempt of fools can't reach you.
I used to be afraid... of a word, a look, anything...
That Rageot woman really hurt me once.
I was crossing the Planques bridge.
She grabbed her niece away, as if I had the plague.
You feel ashamed...
Whoever you sleep with...
Sometimes, at night, a few paces from my snoring father...
I, scorned buy everyone, but for what?
...
I get up, I listen...
my little body feels so strong...
I go to the window, as if drawn by a voice outside...
I wait...
I'm ready...
I must be insane...
You're over emotional...
Let me examine you...
I've changed my mind.
All right.
I suspect you've been pregnant longer than you say.
There's no hiding from Science!
I didn't lie to you.
It doesn't show yet.
I know you won't let me down.
What do you mean?
I'm not stupid.
I know it's easy for you people.
One, two, three and it's gone.
Love won't make me lose my head.
What you're asking is illegal and I won't do it.
Then don't...
I'll go to Boulogne!
All I'm asking is a trifle!
You can leave if you want.
Don't let me go.
Don't throw me out today.
Usually, I'm not scared...
This is the first time.
I also want to apologize.
I was so unpleasant just now.
If you'd made me go, I'd have been back.
Because I need you.
Not for what you think.
Let's not squabble over a baby that'll never be born.
I need you because you're the only man I don't lie to.
Think that's nothing?
You're wrong!
I lie all the time, I can't help it.
Even as a kid I hated my lies.
With you I can be natural, as I want to be.
Why aren't we like animals?
They live and die unthinkingly
Oxen calmly chew hay before they're slaughtered.
I envy that.
If I'd put you out, where'd you have gone?
To kill myself.
I pictured a place.
...at Vauroux pond to drown myself.
You can see the chateau from there.
It's silly, I know..
What are you scared of?
Sometimes my wife comes home without warning.
Do you believe in hell?
Mouchette, don't be silly!
Stop it!
you can be so annoying!
You believe in hell?
Of course not.
I knew it.
You fear your wife, but not hell.
You're so stupid!
Enough!
Shut up or leave!
Now you wish you'd put Mouchette out.
She'd be in the pond now.
her little mouth full of mud, safely silent.
Coward!
You fear your wife, but not me!
Why not me?
Because you're a good girl.
No doubt.
From Mouchette you want only pleasure.
You just proved that.
But Mouchette's baby...!
It's not my child!
I didn't ask you to recognize it.
We're both at the bottom of the same pit.
What pit?
Who suspects Mr. Gallet makes love to a girl of 16?
Two-timing your wife here is half your fun.
You like troubled water.
In my Vauroux pond I see odd creatures..
Like centipedes, only longer.
They float on the clear surface, then suddenly dive.
A cloud of mud rises.
We're like those bugs.
Hidden from the fools by a cloud:
our big secret.
When you realize that, we'll love each other.
What do you mean?
Listen:
You're not the father!
Guess who is?
Cadignan... the Marquis de Cadignan!
Kiss my hand!
Go on, kiss my hand!
It's the hand that killed him.
This is insane!
You're upset and having an early pregnancy.
Is this a joke?
Believe what you like!
I killed him.
What day?
The 27th
What time?
5 a.m. I can still see the clock.
I took his gun.
It was on the table.
I didn't know it was loaded.
I fired when the muzzle touched him.
Convinced now?
The inquest is over, the verdict given.
I'm not judging you.
Seducing minors has its drawbacks.
I'm your friend.
You can talk to me.
You didn't go home on the night of the 26th?
What a question!
Your father?
Asleep.
Sneaking out was easy.
- How'd you get back?
- Same way.
But the next day, when they heard...?
They thought it was suicide, as everyone did.
You killed him and ran away?
To the pond, to wash my shoes.
I examined the body.
It looked like suicide.
Such close range...
Under the chin...
I was so much shorter than he...
He came right toward me...
He wasn't scared...
It weighed too much on my mind.
You're mad!
I don't believe a word of it!
It's true!
I can't live or breathe because of that awful lie.
Now I've told all!
You had a bad dream, Mouchette.
If I doubt my own mind..
what can I believe?
Why reject the word of a repentant killer?
I do repent.
If you doubt my "dream" I'll tell it to everyone.
Alright, let's drop it.
I scared you, huh?
A bit.
You're so nervous and impulsive right now.
Don't worry.
I've seen nothing, heard nothing.
You've nothing to fear from anyone.
What's that mean?
True or not, your story's like a dream.
No one saw you go out or come back.
No witnesses.
no bloodstains, no evidence.
It'd be just as silly if I said I did it.
Chatter, chatter...
Be serious.
Think you deserve absolution?
We'd give you God without confession, but God, He knows...
We've a baby to baptize...
Sunday.
That possible?
Of course.
Father Donissan will do it.
What do you say that flusters our people so?
When I talk of you, they can't meet my eye.
I'm sending you to Etapies to help the priest there retire.
It's 8 miles on foot along the road.
Dean, you're wanted...
Coming!
You like to walk, unless you want to take the train...
I'll give you my coat.
You'll freeze in your cassock.
A dark night, eh?
We're still a long way from daybreak.
Darkness draws folks together.
It daunts the wiliest.
If you met me by day, you'd pass right by.
Come from Etaples?
Going where?
To Campagne.
I won't go all the way.
We'll cut across country.
Thanks for your kindness and charity.
My cassock frightens some people.
Ignoramuses!
Illiterate yokels!
You see them at fairs and markets all over the North.
My uncle, my mother's brother, is a priest.
I know this area well.
Live around here?
I don't live anywhere I travel for a horse trader.
I was on the coast yesterday, but I'm moving inland.
No time to take root.
You married?
To poverty.
I haven't time to think of that!
I move around, never stay put.
Look out!
Come, come...
May the Lord repay your trouble.
He put you in my path when my courage flagged.
This has been a long...
hard night for me,
more than you can imagine.
Etaples to Campagne:
10 miles of bad roads!
My short-cut has saved us over a mile.
Here's the Chalindry road.
I won't go that far with you.
You in a hurry?
I've already lost too much time.
If you like, we can spend the night at my place.
I mean... there's a hut at the edge of the woods...
Belongs to a charcoal-burner.
We can make a fire.
Stop for a moment.
You've walked a long way.
You're worn out.
Forgive my weakness.
I'm ashamed to be seen like this.
A poor priest like me, trying... to solace the poor, to bolster their courage... when God deserts me..
I saw you before, walking on all fours.
You saw me?
Don't be embarrassed.
You're exhausted.
You've overdone it.
Patience...
that's a good remedy, preacher.
Less drastic than some, but surer.
Patience...
It's not fatigue.
I'm sturdy, I can fight a long time... but not against some things...
Lean on me.
I'm your friend.
I love you dearly.
I have no friends.
Rest...
I sought you...
hunted you ardently...
A friend's kiss.
A trifle!
I've kissed others..
lots of others!
Want to know something?
I kiss you all!
You bear me in your flesh...
None of you escapes me!
I'm leaving you...
You'll never see me again!
Cling to your obstinacy!
If you knew the fate your master plans for you...
We alone are not fooled!
We chose his hate, not his love!
Why enlighten your muddy brain about this, cringing dog, enslaved brute?
That's enough now!
It's time we split up!
What did you want of me?
To test you...
From now until you die.
God assigns the test.
I'll wait for it!
I don't want to hear about it now...
and from such a mouth!
Seeing us is scary, eh?
Look me in the eye...
You'll recognize yourself!
See how transparent you are?
Back, Satan!
To know oneself!
See oneself!
Who hasn't dreamed of such a vision?
So perfect an image...
Not like in a mirror!
Every thought's there, from start to finish!
Your conscience is trained to examine itself, but it can never achieve such insight!
You can grasp only one thought at a time.
Man never fully knows what's going on in himself.
You see yourself in enigmas, not clearly!
- Look!
-
All your thoughts are here, in detail... the endless web that links them...
You know your whole life!
Go away!
How can you refuse such a vision?
I don't need that!
I don't want to know myself this way!
I'm sure you already wish you did!
Have I any time left?
Answer me!
Am I going to die here?
Then if I live a day or 20 years, I'll tear your secret from you!
I'll follow you if I must!
I don't fear you!
I'll nail you like an owl to the center of my prayer!
Your prayers don't scare me!
You were graced tonight.
You'll pay heavily for it...
my dear exorcist!
What grace?
You'll see!
What grace!
Your curiosity lost you!
You'll see a few others as you saw yourself.
I held you to my breast.
I took you in my arms.
I cradled you.
You will often fondle me, thinking you're fondling the other!
You are marked now... with the sign of my hatred!
Who are you?
What do you want?
I'm a quarryman in St. Pre.
Feeling better?
You'd fainted.
A horse dealer found you before I did.
The two of us put you here.
You saw him?
He's here?
Shall I call him?
No thanks...
I need to stretch my legs.
You know him?
Who?
...
Yeah, last month he sold me two fillies.
We can walk a ways together.
If you're tired, get a carriage at Sansonnet's.
You alright?
We're here, Father.
You go straight ahead.
I could come with you...
No, the walk did me good.
You're back, Marquis?
Oh, it's just you.
What do you want?
Stopping people at this hour!
I came the long way...
Odd?
Not really.
I can't sleep nights.
A man of God who hides in the bushes to peek at girls?
You don't think it's funny!
I love to laugh.
Is that forbidden?
We don't have much to say.
You assume I just left my lover.
You're not entirely wrong.
Let's walk.
You have nothing to fear from me...
I'm glad we met up...
It's not too late...
Maybe too soon.
I didn't seek you.
I came a long way round to meet you.
To draw you away; you know the dead man you await is not here.
What dead man?
When I saw you...
I saw God in your heart.
Don't be ashamed.
No sermons!
They mean nothing to me.
Harsher ordeals await you.
How old are you?
You should know, since you know so much!
Till now you've lived like a child.
Who won't forgive a child?
God helps us even in our madness.
Even when we curse Him, He supports us.
What do you want with a girl like me, a child?
You won't meet many in your choirs like me.
You'll save on holy water!
May your God spare you what I've been through!
You feel special.
I think you've never left the beaten path.
Why did sin seem so worth the trouble to you?
You're an odd priest.
So being evil is nothing...
even if...
Forget that.
To God, you are not guilty of that murder.
You are Satan's toy.
Satan!
I have the power to see inside you.
I now know your story as well as you do, Germaine Malorthy.
I know every twist and turn, every thought...
Pull yourself together...
You're exhausted...
You've said enough.
Said enough?
What have I said?
Nothing!
You spoke at length...
I spoke?
That's impossible.
What right have you...?
I have no right over you.
If God...
- God!
-
God's a joke...
God means nothing.
I didn't mean to offend you.
You lied to me just now?
I said nothing.
Did I?
You can't refuse to answer.
I must know.
To find out, I'll do anything you want...
Now you know...
I admitted everything...
So what?
I have nothing to fear.
Did I really talk in my sleep?
I saw you.
As no other person was ever seen.
Now you can never escape me.
Does your sin horrify me?
You offended God no more than animals do...
Your only sin was a fetus.
Look inside yourself..
The vice you're so proud of has died there...
Your heart's filled with self-loathing.
You've found only vain dreams..
You think you've killed a man.
Poor girl!
Later you crawled to a man baser than the first.
Whom you scorn and who fears you.
You can't escape him;
you told of your crime.
I can't escape him...
Yes, I can.
Whenever I want.
People thought me insane.
I didn't deny it.
I was waiting to be ready.
You never will be.
Think you're free?
Only God could free you.
Your life repeats other lives, all alike.
Lived like troughs where cattle feed.
Your actions betray your heredity.
God lets me see those from whom you spring.
Truly...
I have seen you in them, them in you.
All those faces blend into the face of vice.
Their actions become an act of murder.
Evil everywhere, that's your generation.
Hundreds of men and women linked by the same cancer...
You saw yourself in your family, as one of the herd.
Nothing you've done was not done before.
No thought, that wasn't already buried with the dead.
Only age-old actions.
Not similar; exactly alike.
Not repeated; unique!
You feel the vast deceit of your life?
You hear the laughter of your deceiver?
Your wretched ancestors have claimed you as their own.
And you surrender all.
You're feeding them your own life.
What can you do?
They've left their sins in your child's heart.
Back already?
Made a fool of myself again:
I got lost.
You reached Etaples too late?
Confession was over?
There's more to it...
Arrive late, alright, but not get there at all...?
What will they say?
Too bad.
I'll write to Etaples tonight.
I didn't lose my way.
I took the main road and left it only briefly.
By going straight ahead, I couldn't miss it, even at night.
I didn't get there.
Even stranger... worse...
an ordeal awaited me.
Go on.
God twice let me see through a body to the soul.
Not by ordinary means, but...
by a special grace...
Which you see as a miracle?
I think so.
Report it to your bishop.
I've awaited a supernatural sign of God's plan for you.
The sign has come.
Now I'm more puzzled than ever;
the sign is ambiguous... the miracle isn't pure.
There's more.
I met Germaine Malorthy...
I had a vision...
a certainty... that she killed the Marquis de Cadignan.
Her only consolation is to revisit the places she can't forget... the silent walls where her mute witness waits...
She confessed it all.
Harsher ordeals are in store for her.
She's desperate...
It may outweigh her remorse...
If you've misjudged and harmed that girl... what an awful responsibility!
I can't let you behave like that in the parish.
I can't trust you!
We must follow the infallible word and no other!
Did you help her?
That you, Germaine?
It's me, Mother.
Cousin Georges took me to Viel...
on his way to market.
At this time of day?
He had a load of pigs...
so I got a lift part-way.
You had no dinner.
I'll make coffee.
I'm tired, I just want to sleep.
Let me be.
You're a lunatic!
What have you done?
Do something!
What have you done?
I tried to restore her to God...
Are you responsible...?
What's happened?
I tried to restore her to God...
Bringing a dying girl to the altar...
a relic from the past.
Father Donissan will enter the Trappist monastery.
Later we'll find a suitable parish for him.
You baffle me.
I'm used to wisdom from you.
Wisdom is the vice of the old.
Here's the "Imitation of Christ" with your annotations...
You made it yours.
Soon there'll be no way I can help you.
No!
I'll remember you even in Satan's arms.
I didn't teach you blasphemy.
That wasn't blasphemy.
I was shown man's misery and Satan's power for a reason.
You began with too much self-mortification.
You threw yourself into the ministry!
You were pleased with yourself.
You should have found peace.
You haven't.
God never refuses peace.
You're rejecting it.
I suspect you've made some dangerous vow.
I've made no vow... no promise..
barely a wish...
It's poisoning your heart.
You like that picture, no?
Very much.
So many souls possessed by sin...
that enraged me.
To save them, I offered all I had...
My life, first... it's not much...
My salvation, if God wants it.
You risk damnation by straying from the path, as you've done.
The spirit of evil has entered your life.
Fools ignore such things, some priests daren't utter Satan's name!
Inner life today is a battlefield of instincts.
Morality?
Hygiene of the senses.
Temptation is a mere carnal appetite.
People want only what's pleasant and useful...
There's nothing for a saint in such a world... or he's called mad!
Are we truly so wretched?
You're surely not meant for a cloister
Your retreat will be a time of better trial and moral loneliness.
It will last longer than you think.
Hope is almost dead in you!
You'll be alone on your chosen road!
I didn't ask for that!
Let me live and die in humility!
What was begun here will not be finished!
We'll miss you.
You weren't born to please.
The world hates your taste for strength...
Will you ever vanquish the distrust, pity, and opposition... of others?
They'll never let go of you.
Who'll stop me from being what I was?
I attract no attention.
I've the reputation I deserve.
If you let me, I could pass unnoticed...
Unnoticed!
God's work in us is seldom what we expect.
He seems to get things wrong, to waste time.
God wears us down!
How old I feel!
And how... unsuited for it...
I'll never learn to be old!
Poor pastor of Lumbres...
He's good for nothing!
So many nights like last night, until the final night!
I can no longer love.
Does my life have a meaning?
Never any rest...
They've pushed me to the brink...
Beyond it... silence, true silence!
To die...
In the parlor, Father...
It's Mr. Havret, about his sick son.
Which one?
Father, I've come to get you.
Since last night my son's been paralyzed.
The doctor said there's no hope; meningitis!
My wife begged me to come for you We must go, Father.
It's not my parish.
You've a priest at Luzarnes.
I'm touched that Mrs. Havret thought of me... poor woman!
Let's go.
Marthe!
I have to go to Luzarnes.
Not on an empty stomach...
I'll make coffee.
Stay, Father, don't leave us!
Pierre!
I'm ashamed.
Forgive this poor woman's ignorance.
I have great esteem for you.
Pray for me!
Don't tempt me!
Let's go out.
I can't go on...
I'm a poor priest a wretched blind man...
Don't say that...
Your imagination, fatigue...
Why'd I leave her...?
What greater pain than the death of a child?
Nothing's worse.
As I stood before her, I thought...
What?
Nothing...
Only that inner voice...
I knew...
I still know..
I'm sure that a word from me would have... revived... that dead child...
Look at me, answer me frankly...
Who stopped you from testing your power?
I don't know...
Follow me in, I'll find some excuse...
Go to where the body lies...
I'll try...
You think me insane.
Not long ago, I'd have wished for it...
Be careful, Sabroux...
You haven't understood me.
He is there...
He is in our conscience...
He is our conscience!
Men like you!
Satan is prince of this world, he holds it in his hands.
He is here, victorious!
You understand?
We are conquered, I tell you.
And God is conquered with us.
What blasphemy!
Leave me...
Don't listen to me..
Leave you!
Nothing is impossible for a man like you.
I'll follow you.
God inspired you...
Restore the child to its mother.
God is mocking me.
Say who is master, him or You?
Show yourself before abandoning me forever!
O Father, I would have sacrificed even eternal life!
I accept Your sovereign decision.
He's alive!
You are a saint!
One day you'll know, you'll understand...
I hope for your forgiveness...
Forgive me...
My God!
Do not forsake me!
Father Donissan will be glad to see you.
He's out just now.
He's visiting a sick child.
And you know how he is...
Yes, I do...
He arrived here by cart one evening, with his few possessions, a bed frame, some odds and ends, his clothes and books...
It was very foggy...
He had a hard time finding the village.
Next day, he rang the bells, so the village knew it had a priest.
The presbytery was in ruins.
The wind swept through the walls,
Tons of rubble had to be removed.
He worked with the laborers, he fixed it all himself.
He hasn't changed.
I got here later.
to look after him and the house.
Downstairs, that is;
I never go up to his room.
From the start, he said he'd deal with that himself.
I don't even make his bed.
He speaks of you every day.
Father...
Your pain is barren, Satan.
When did I first yield?
You suffered, you prayed with me.
Even that miracle...
Don't mark our time, Lord.
Our attention wavers...
Lord... if I'm still useful,
don't take me from this world.
He's so pale!
In the name of the Father, the son and the holy Ghost.
Amen.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
I confess to Almighty God, to Blessed Mary, ever Virgin, to St. Michael the Archangel, to Blessed John the Baptist, the Holy Apostles...
Peter and Paul, and to all the Saints, and to you, Father, that I have sinned exceedingly in thought, word, deed, and omission...
With you it all seems simple.
Alone, I'm worthless.
I'm like a zero ;
only useful with other numbers.
Priests are so wretched.
They spend their lives seeing God humiliated.
People make fun of me.
I'm like a wall covered with obscenities.
You're weary.
Weariness is an evil thought.
Suspend your visits.
I do more harm than good.
At first I didn't know what evil was.
I learned it from the moths of sinners.
No one knows better than a priest.
...the awful monotony of sin nbsp
I can't talk to them.
I can only absolve or weep.
nbsp
If one absolution in thirty did its work... the world would soon be converted.
nbsp
You're silent tonight, Estelle
Still no coffee at night, Father Donissan?
No thanks, Dean nbsp
I'll take mine in the next room.
nbsp
I've been waiting for you.
I know
I want the Bishop to return me to the monastery.
Please back me up.
Why?
I don't belong here.
Parish work is too much for me.
My superiors thought so.
You do, too.
nbsp
I'm willing to request your recall, but it's complicated.
Are you overtaxed here?
Don't be childish.
The parish is too poor to feed a useless mouth.
Perhaps I could go to the Trappists for a while.
Trappists!
You all want to go there!
A monastery's no rest home.
nbsp
What should I do?
Now you're showing sense.
If you can't guide others, how can you judge yourself?
You've been given a master ; me!
I know it...
You were allowed to take holy orders... despite your superior's doubts.
I am not totally incapable of parish work fitting my intelligence.
Luckily, my health...
Health is God's gift.
I know its price too well.
Your strength and manual skills.
suggest you were meant for a humbler vocation.
It's never too late to admit an error.
Should you try something else, or return to your plow?
I'm asking, not answering.
A man like me is easy to size up.
You're being tactful.
I'm eager to obey.
Don't keep me in suspense.
I know you're impatient.
But what you hope I'll say maybe be too great a temptation.
You want my decree.
Will you obey it?
nbsp
I'm not just a crude, ignorant priest, unable to make himself loved.
I was a poor seminary student.
nbsp
It took a miracle... to get me admitted to the priesthood.
I lack intelligence, memory, diligence.
Yet I can't overcome my stubbornness.
Your submission touches me...
I must have seemed cruel.
I'm going to be even more so.
Do you know whose hands you've put yourself in?
Please...
The hands of a man you don't respect!
nbsp
I seem to live like a wealthy layman.
You're ashamed of my leisurely ways, admit it.
You know fools praise my experience...
You think it's sterile, of no use to anyone.
nbsp
That's how you see it, no?
nbsp
The thought was unintentional...
That's not an excuse.
nbsp
Now you know my wicked mind... and now... nbsp
My dear boy!
nbsp
I thought so!
nbsp
My boy, our Lord is not displeased with you... nbsp
Burn this devilish thing tomorrow.
We'll find something better.
nbsp
Your mortification is misplaced.
a proper priest wears white linen.
nbsp
You know, my boy.
nbsp your opinion of me is by and large correct... nbsp but it errs on one point:
I judge myself harshly.
I'm reaching my end empty-handed.
nbsp
You're very different from me.
nbsp
You've changed me!
nbsp
I sent for you dreaming naively of bringing in a young priest with poor grades, lacking the qualities I so prize, and shaping him.
This was a heavy burden to take on.
nbsp
But you are shaping me!
I need you!
[i]They[/i] didn't see the gift the Holy Spirit gave you.
[i]They[/i] never see anything!
God appoints us.
nbsp
The spirit of strength is within you!
nbsp
Anyone but me, assuming he'd seen as clearly, wouldn't dare speak to you as I do.
Human prudence is a trap.
nbsp
Truth will out.
Sanctity!
nbsp
My pronouncing that word pains you, I know.
You know what the word means ;
a vocation, a calling.
You must climb to where God calls you, or be lost.
Except no human help.
Doubting your powers and God's aims led you into a blind alley.
I'm setting you back on your road.
nbsp
I am giving you to those who will prey on you!
nbsp
May the Lord bless you!
Allow me to withdraw.
Listening to you, I felt despair, but not any more.
nbsp
Only you, God, may judge me as I am.
nbsp
A man knows what is happening within him.
It's an impenetrable secret to anyone else.
nbsp
Father Donissan?
You'll be late.
nbsp
Are you ill?
No, Dean.
nbsp
I won't be a minute.
nbsp
It's me!
nbsp
What a situation!
nbsp
You come here at 1 A.M. after your father's visit...
You deserve a spanking.
I'm tired.
I fell in the mud, I'm soaked.
nbsp
My throat's dry from crying.
I was out of my mind.
They'd have ended by killing me.
What parents!
They'll never see me again!
Nonsense.
I've god money.
I can catch a train to Paris.
My aunt has a nice house and a grocery store.
I'll work for her and be very happy.
Are you of age?
I will be, in time.
nbsp
Let be stay!
nbsp
Stay?
Where?
They'll all be on our backs...
including Gallet.
that damn Deputy!
I was seeing him tomorrow with Dad.
Mouchette, I've god enough problems...
I need time.
They say your furniture's the finest around.
nbsp
Will you answer me?
Answer what?
Answer what!
You can't move in here.
It'd stir up a storm.
It's late.
I'll take you part-way back.
I won't go to Campagne tonight.
Where'll you sleep?
Here, by the road, anywhere...
Do I care?
Sleep wherever.
You should've give me time.
In a month, I'd have sold all this.
But your father threatened me...
Because you blabbed, like at confession...
Don't cry...please don't cry.
Why are you crying?
nbsp
I didn't mean what I said.
nbsp
I can imagine your bully of a father...
Did he whip you?
nbsp
I didn't tell him a thing.
nbsp
-Why wasn't I told?
-You wouldn't have believed me.
nbsp
Come on, it's over.
nbsp
You don't believe me?
nbsp
I don't believe you?
nbsp
I've done a lot of thinking in the last week.
But it all just became clear.
nbsp
Life, that is.
nbsp
I hardly knew myself...
Me, Germaine...
I take pleasure in anything, sunshine...any silly thing.
nbsp
But deep down there's a longing for something else.
nbsp
But what?
Something you must have, nothing else matters.
nbsp
We girls'd say:
"He gets the prettiest ones"
nbsp
So I thought, "Why not me?
It's my turn"
nbsp
And now my dad scared you...
You're pitiful!
nbsp
What did I do wrong?
nbsp
Listen...
If I can sell the mill at Brimeux, I'll have 30,000 francs after settling my debts.
nbsp 10,000 for you, 20,000 for me.
Keep your money.
You need it more than I do.
nbsp
Alright, turn down my money.
nbsp
But don't spit at me.
I'm not ashamed of poverty.
Neither am I. And I didn't ask for anything.
You didn't, but your father...
What's that got to do with me?
nbsp
He lied ;
I didn't give you away!
nbsp
Last night when he said that, I was furious!
I could've stuck my scissors in my throut...to spite him!
nbsp
You two don't know me.
Trouble's just starting.
nbsp
I'm wrong to get angry... nbsp
Take me to Paris...anywhere... nbsp
After the baby's born.
nbsp
The baby!
My father lied to you and you believed him.
nbsp
Shut up!
nbsp
If he did, I'll break his neck!
nbsp
Once everything's sold, I'll find us a place.
nbsp
Think I'll settle for a country cottage?
nbsp
At my age?
For a life of rural excitement!
nbsp
If you don't want me, I have ideas of my own...
I know the perfect man... nbsp
Who?
nbsp ...who'll refuse me nothing...
he's rich...educated...a scientist... nbsp
A Deputy...
Yes, a Deputy.
Gallet!
What a catch!
nbsp
He has two kids and an ambitous wife.
You have big ideas for your age!
nbsp
Well, your father sells lousy beer.
nbsp and you selll what you've got!
Gallet's mistress...
and under Papa's nose!
He'll set me up in Paris.
Yes, with a pretty room and freedom!
A Deputy's mistress... nbsp
Next a Minister's...
then the president's!
nbsp
Laugh!
...
Why not me?
nbsp
Alright....
You can stay till tomorrow.
nbsp
But tell me the truth;
have you and Gallet...?
nbsp
Yes, I've slept with him.
nbsp
Come here!
nbsp
Little bitch!
nbsp
What are you doing?
nbsp
Answer me!
nbsp
Put that down!
nbsp
You hear me, Mouchette?
You're a pest!
Why are you here?
nbsp
I'm pregnant.
It doesn't show yet.
How long?
About 3 months.
You only admit it now?
"Admit" Big word!
nbsp
Undress...in my office.
I'll freeze in there!
nbsp
I won't leave tonight.
nbsp
I told Dad I was going to my aunt's nbsp
Your wife's back tomorrow, no?
Your rashness will be our ruin.
We used to only meet out of town.
Now you make up and lie.
Scared?
nbsp
Ever known women like me?
nbsp
It's fun to be beautiful.
A new suitor is always handsome.
But a suitor who never tires of us is even handsomer.
nbsp
That's how you look at me.
nbsp
Men are so sad.
nbsp
We grow too used to them to notice.
nbsp
You didn't examine me!
I will now.
Another time.
Anyway, I know more about it than anyone.
nbsp
In 6 months I'll be a "proud mother",
This pregnancy seems unlikely.
nbsp
You love me?
nbsp
I ask because of an idea I have.
nbsp
What idea?
Do you love me?
Answer me!
nbsp
Don't give me that!
Tell me you love me.
nbsp
You don't dare say it?
Scared?
nbsp
You hate me, but less than I do.
You don't know about self-hate.
nbsp
About what?
Hate and contempt...
you've never felt that.
nbsp
It's like an idea that you get...
you want to sink... nbsp into a pit where the contempt of fools can't reach you.
I used to be afraid...of a word, a look, anything... nbsp
That Rageot woman really hurt me once.
I was crossin the Planques bridge.
She grabbed her niece away, as if I had the plague.
nbsp
You feel ashamed... nbsp
Whoever you sleep with... nbsp
Sometimes, at night, a few paces from my snoring father... nbsp
I, scorned buy everyone, but for what?
... nbsp
I get up, I listen...
my little body feels so strong... nbsp
I go to the window, as if drawn by a voice outside... nbsp
I wait...
I'm ready... nbsp
I must be insane... nbsp
You're over emotional...
Let me examine you...
I've changed my mind.
nbsp
All right.
I suspect you've been pregnant longer than you say.
nbsp
There's no hiding from Science!
I didn't lie to you.
It doesn't show yet.
nbsp
I know you won't let me down.
What do you mean?
I'm not stupid.
I know it's easy for you people.
One, two, three and it's gone.
nbsp
Love won't make me lose my head.
What you're asking is illegal and I won't do it.
Then don't...
I'll go to Boulogne!
nbsp
All I'm asking is a trifle!
You can leave if you want.
nbsp
Don't let me go.
nbsp
Don't throw me out today.
nbsp
Usually, I'm not scared...
This is the first time.
nbsp
I also want to apologize.
I was so unpleasant just now.
nbsp
If you'd made me go, I'd have been back.
nbsp
Because I need you.
Not for what you think.
nbsp
Let's not squabble over a baby that'll never be born.
nbsp
I need you because you're the only man I don't lie to.
nbsp
Think that's nothing?
You're wrong!
nbsp
I lie all the time, I can't help it.
nbsp
Even as a kid I hated my lies.
nbsp
With you I can be natural, as I want to be.
nbsp
Why aren't we like animals?
They live and die unthinkingly nbsp
Oxen calmly chew hay before they're slaughtered.
nbsp
I envy that.
nbsp
If I'd put you out, where'd you have gone?
nbsp
To kill myself.
nbsp
I pictured a place.
...at Vauroux pond to drown myself.
nbsp
You can see the chateau from there.
nbsp
It's silly, I know..
nbsp
What are you scared of?
Sometimes my wife comes home without warning.
nbsp
Do you believe in hell?
nbsp
Mouchette, don't be silly!
nbsp
Stop it!
you can be so annoying!
nbsp
You believe in hell?
nbsp
Of course not.
nbsp
I knew it.
nbsp
You fear your wife, but not hell.
You're so stupid!
nbsp
Enough!
Shut up or leave!
nbsp
Now you wish you'd put Mouchette out.
nbsp
She'd be in the pond now.
her little mouth full of mud, safely silent.
nbsp
Coward!
nbsp
You fear your wife, but not me!
Why not me?
nbsp
Because you're a good girl.
nbsp
No doubt.
From Mouchette you want only pleasure.
You just proved that.
nbsp
But Mouchette's baby...!
nbsp
It's not my child!
I didn't ask you to recognize it.
nbsp
We're both at the bottom of the same pit.
nbsp
What pit?
Who suspects Mr. Gallet makes love to a girl of 16?
nbsp
Two-timing your wife here is half your fun.
nbsp
You like troubled water.
nbsp
In my Vauroux pond I see odd creatures..
nbsp
Like centipedes, only longer.
nbsp
They float on the clear surface, then suddenly dive.
nbsp
A cloud of mud rises.
We're like those bugs.
nbsp
Hidden from the fools by a cloud:
our big secret.
nbsp
When you realize that, we'll love each other.
nbsp
What do you mean?
Listen:
You're not the father!
nbsp
Guess who is?
Cadignan...the Marquis de Cadignan!
nbsp
Kiss my hand!
nbsp
Go on, kiss my hand!
nbsp
It's the hand that killed him.
nbsp
This is insane!
nbsp
You're upset and having an early pregnancy.
nbsp
Is this a joke?
nbsp
Believe what you like!
nbsp
I killed him.
nbsp
What day?
The 27th
What time?
5 A.M. I can still see the clock.
nbsp
I took his gun.
It was on the table.
I didn't know it was loaded.
nbsp
I fired when the muzzle touched him.
nbsp
Convinced now?
nbsp
The inquest is over, the verdict given.
I'm not judging you.
nbsp
Seducing minors has its drawbacks.
nbsp
I'm your friend.
You can talk to me.
nbsp
You didn't go home on the night of the 26th?
nbsp
What a question!
nbsp
Your father?
Asleep.
Sneaking out was easy.
-How'd you get back?
-Same way.
nbsp
But the next day, when they heard...?
nbsp
They thought it was suicide, as everyone did.
nbsp
You killed him and ran away?
To the pond, to wash my shoes.
nbsp
I examined the body.
It looked like suicide.
Such close range...
Under the chin...
I was so much shorter than he... nbsp
He came right toward me...
He wasn't scared... nbsp
It weighed too much on my mind.
nbsp
You're mad!
I don't believe a word of it!
nbsp
It's true!
nbsp
I can't live or breathe because of that awful lie.
nbsp
Now I've told all!
nbsp
You had a bad dream, Mouchette.
nbsp
If I doubt my own mind..
what can I believe?
nbsp
Why reject the word of a repentant killer?
I do repent.
nbsp
If you doubt my "dream" I'll tell it to everyone.
nbsp
Alright, let's drop it.
nbsp
I scared you, huh?
nbsp
A bit.
You're so nervous and impulsive right now.
nbsp
Don't worry.
I've seen nothing, heard nothing.
nbsp
You've nothing to fear from anyone.
nbsp
What's that mean?
True or not, your story's like a dream.
No one saw you go out or come back.
No witnesses.
no bloodstans, no evidence.
It'd be just as silly if I said I did it.
nbsp
Chatter, chatter...
Be serious.
nbsp
Think you deserve absolution?
nbsp
We'd give you God without confession, nbsp but God, He knows... nbsp
We've a baby to baptize...
Sunday.
That possible?
Of course.
Father Donissan will do it.
nbsp
What do you say that flusters our people so?
nbsp
When I talk of you, they can't meet my eye.
nbsp
I'm sending you to Etapies to help the priest there retire.
nbsp
nbsp
It's 8 miles on foot along the road.
Dean, you're wanted...
Coming!
You like to walk, unless you want to take the train... nbsp
I'll give you my coat.
You'll freeze in your cassock.
nbsp
A dark night, eh?
We're still a long way from daybreak.
Darkness draws folks together.
It daunts the wiliest.
nbsp
If you met me by day, you'd pass right by.
nbsp
Come from Etaples?
Going where?
nbsp
To Campagne.
I won't go all the way.
We'll cut across country.
nbsp
Thanks for your kindness and charity.
nbsp
My cassock frightens some people.
Ignoramuses!
Illiterate yokels!
nbsp
You see them at fairs and markets all over the North.
nbsp
My uncle, my mother's brother, is a priest.
nbsp
I know this area well.
Live around here?
I don't live anywher.e I travel for a horse trader.
nbsp
I was on the coast yesterday, but I'm moving inland.
nbsp
No time to take root.
You married?
To poverty.
I haven't time to think of that!
nbsp
I move around, never stay put.
nbsp
Look out!
nbsp
Come, come... nbsp
May the Lord repay your trouble.
He put you in my path when my courage flagged.
nbsp
This has been a long...
hard night for me, nbsp nbsp more than you can imagine.
Etaples to Campagne:
10 miles of bad roads!
nbsp
My short-cut has saved us over a mile.
nbsp
Here's the Chalindry road.
nbsp
I won't go that far with you.
nbsp
You in a hurry?
nbsp
I've already lost too much time.
nbsp
If you like, we can spend the night at my place.
nbsp
I mean... there's a hut at the edge of the woods...
Belongs to a charcoal-burner.
We can make a fire.
nbsp
Stop for a moment.
You've walked a long way.
nbsp
You're worn out.
nbsp
Forgive my weakness.
nbsp
I'm ashamed to be seen like this.
nbsp
A poor priest like me, trying... nbsp to solace the poor, to bolster their courage... nbsp when God deserts me..
nbsp
I saw you before, walking on all fours.
nbsp
You saw me?
nbsp
Don't be embarrassed.
You're exhausted.
nbsp
You've overdone it.
Patience...
that's a good remedy, preacher.
nbsp
Less drastic than some, but surer.
Patience... nbsp
It's not fatigue.
I'm sturdy, I can fight a long time... nbsp but not against some things... nbsp
Lean on me.
nbsp
I'm your friend.
nbsp
I love you dearly.
nbsp
I have no friends.
nbsp
Rest... nbsp
I sought you...
hanted you ardently... nbsp
A friend's kiss.
nbsp
A trifle!
nbsp
I've kissed others..
lots of others!
nbsp
Want to know something?
I kiss you all!
nbsp
You bear me in your flesh...
None of you escapes me!
nbsp
I'm leaving you...
You'll never see me again!
nbsp
Cling to your obstinacy!
nbsp
If you knew the fate your master plans for you...
We alone are not fooled!
We chose his hate, not his love!
nbsp
Why enlighten your muddy brain about this, nbsp cringing dog, enslaved brute?
nbsp
That's enough now!
nbsp
It's time we split up!
nbsp
What did you want of me?
To test you...
From now until you die.
nbsp
God assigns the test.
I'll wait for it!
nbsp
I don't want to hear about it now...
and from such a mouth!
nbsp
Seeing us is scary, eh?
nbsp
Look me in the eye...
You'll recognize yourself!
nbsp
See how transparent you are?
nbsp
Back, Satan!
nbsp
To know oneself!
nbsp
See oneself!
nbsp
Who hasn't dreamed of such a vision?
nbsp
So perfect an image...
Not like in a mirror!
nbsp
Every thought's there, from start to finish!
nbsp
Your conscience is trained to examine itself, nbsp but it can never achieve such insight!
nbsp
You can grasp only one thought at a time.
nbsp
Man never fully knows what's going on in himself.
nbsp
You see yourself in enigmas, not clearly!
nbsp
-Look!
- nbsp
All your thoughts are here, in detail... nbsp the endless web that links them... nbsp
You know your whole life!
nbsp
Go away!
nbsp
How can you refuse such a vision?
nbsp
I don't need that!
nbsp
I don't want to know myself this way!
nbsp
I'm sure you already wish you did!
nbsp
Have I any time left?
nbsp
Answer me!
nbsp
Am I going to die here?
nbsp
Then if I live a day or 20 years, I'll tear your secret from you!
nbsp
I'll follow you if I must!
I don't fear you!
nbsp
I'll nail you like an owl to the center of my prayer!
nbsp
Your prayers don't scare me!
nbsp
You were graced tonight.
nbsp
You'll pay heavily for it...
my dear exorcist!
nbsp
What grace?
nbsp
You'll see!
nbsp
What grace!
nbsp
Your curiousity lost you!
nbsp
You'll see a few others as you saw yourself.
nbsp
I held you to my breast.
nbsp
I took you in my arms.
nbsp
I cradled you.
nbsp
You will often fondle me, thinking you're fondling [i]the other!
[/i] nbsp
You are marked now... nbsp with the sign of my hatred!
nbsp
Who are you?
What do you want?
nbsp
I'm a quarryman in St. Pre.
Feeling better?
nbsp
You'd fainted.
A horse dealer found you before I did.
nbsp
The two of us put you here.
You saw him?
He's here?
nbsp
Shall I call him?
No thanks...
I need to stretch my legs.
nbsp
You know him?
Who?
...
Yeah, last month he sold me two fillies.
nbsp
We can walk a ways together.
nbsp
If you're tired, get a carriage at Sansonnet's.
nbsp
You alright?
We're here, Father.
You go straight ahead.
I could come with you...
No, the walk did me good.
nbsp
You're back, Marquis?
nbsp
Oh, it's just you.
nbsp
What do you want?
Stopping people at this hour!
nbsp
I came the long way... nbsp
Odd?
Not really.
nbsp
I can't sleep nights.
nbsp
A man of God who hides in the bushes to peek at girls?
nbsp
You don't think it's funny!
nbsp
I love to laugh.
Is that forbidden?
nbsp
We don't have much to say.
nbsp
You assume I just left my lover.
nbsp
You're not entirely wrong.
nbsp
Let's walk.
You have nothing to fear from me... nbsp
I'm glad we met up...
It's not too late... nbsp
Maybe too soon.
nbsp
I didn't seek you.
I came a long way round to meet you.
nbsp
To draw you away; you know the dead man you await is not here.
nbsp
What dead man?
nbsp
When I saw you...
I saw God in your heart.
nbsp
Don't be ashamed.
nbsp
No sermons!
They mean nothing to me.
nbsp
Harsher ordeals await you.
nbsp
How old are you?
You should know, since you know so much!
Till now you've lived like a child.
Who won't forgive a child?
nbsp
God helps us even in our madness.
nbsp
Even when we curse Him, He supports us.
nbsp
What do you want with a girl like me, a child?
nbsp
You won't meet many in your choirs like me.
nbsp
You'll save on holy water!
nbsp
May your God spare you what I've been through!
nbsp
You feel special.
nbsp
I think you've never left the beaten path.
nbsp
Why did sin seem so worth the trouble to you?
nbsp
You're an odd priest.
So being evil is nothing...
even if... nbsp
Forget that.
nbsp
To God, you are not guilty of that murder.
nbsp
You are Satan's toy.
nbsp
Satan!
nbsp
I have the power to see inside you.
nbsp
I now know your story as well as you do, Germaine Malorthy.
nbsp
I know every twist and turn, every thought... nbsp
Pull yourself together... nbsp
You're exhausted... nbsp
You've said enough.
nbsp
Said enough?
What have I said?
Nothing!
nbsp
You spoke at length... nbsp
I spoke?
nbsp
That's impossible.
nbsp
What right have you...?
nbsp
I have no right over you.
If God... nbsp
- God!
- nbsp
God's a joke...
God means nothing.
nbsp
I didn't mean to offend you.
nbsp
You lied to me just now?
I said nothing.
Did I?
nbsp
You can't refuse to answer.
I must know.
nbsp
To find out, I'll do anything you want... nbsp
Now you know...
I admitted everything... nbsp
So what?
I have nothing to fear.
nbsp
Did I really talk in my sleep?
nbsp
I saw you.
As no other person was ever seen.
nbsp
Now you can never escape me.
nbsp
Does your sin horrify me?
You offended God no more... nbsp ...than animals do...
Your only sin was a foetus.
nbsp
Look inside yourself..
nbsp
The vice you're so proud of has died there... nbsp
Your heart's filled with self-loathing.
nbsp
You've found only vain dreams..
You think you've killed a man.
nbsp
Poor girl!
nbsp
Later you crawled to a man baser than the first.
nbsp
Whom you scorn and who fears you.
nbsp
You can't escape him;
you told of your crime.
nbsp
I can't escape him...
Yes, I can.
nbsp
Whenever I want.
nbsp
People thought me insane.
I didn't deny it.
I was waiting to be ready.
You never will be.
Think you're free?
Only God could free you.
nbsp
Your life repeats other lives, all alike.
nbsp
Lived like troughs where cattle feed.
nbsp
Your actions betray your heredity.
nbsp
God lets me see those from whom you spring.
nbsp
Truly...
I have seen you in them, them in you.
nbsp
All those faces blend into the face of vice.
nbsp
Their actions become an act of murder.
nbsp
Evil everywhere, that's your generation.
nbsp
Hundreds of men and women linked by the same cancer... nbsp
You saw yourself in your family, as one of the herd.
nbsp
Nothing you've done was not done before.
No thought, that wasn't already buried with the dead.
nbsp
Only age-old actions.
nbsp
Not similar; exactly alike.
Not repeated; unique!
nbsp
You feel the vast deceit of your life?
nbsp
You hear the laughter of your deceiver?
nbsp
Your wretched ancestors have claimed you as their own.
nbsp
And you surrender all.
nbsp
You're feeding them your own life.
nbsp
What can you do?
They've left their sins in your child's heart.
nbsp
Back already?
Made a fool of myself again:
I got lost.
nbsp
You reached Etaples too late?
Confession was over?
There's more to it...
Arrive late, alright, but not get there at all...?
What will they say?
nbsp
Too bad.
I'll write to Etaples tonight.
nbsp
I didn't lose my way.
nbsp
I took the main road and left it only briefly.
nbsp
By going straight ahead, I couldn't miss it, even at night.
I didn't get there.
Even stranger...worse...
an ordeal awaited me.
nbsp
Go on.
God twice let me see through a body to the soul.
Not by ordinary means, but...
by a special grace... nbsp
Which you see as a miracle?
nbsp
I think so.
nbsp
Report it to your bishop.
nbsp
I've awaited a supernatural sign of God's plan for you.
nbsp
The sign has come.
Now I'm more puzzled than ever;
the sign is ambiguous... nbsp the miracle isn't pure.
nbsp
There's more.
I met Germaine Malorthy...
I had a vision...
a certainty...that she killed the Marquis de Cadignan.
Her only consolation is to revisit the places she can't forget... the silent walls where her mute witness waits... nbsp
She confessed it all.
nbsp
Harsher ordeals are in store for her.
nbsp
She's desperate... nbsp
It may outweigh her remorse... nbsp
If you've misjudged and harmed that girl... what an awful responsibility!
nbsp
I can't let you behave like that in the parish.
nbsp
I can't trust you!
nbsp
We must follow the infallible word and no other!
nbsp
Did you help her?
That you, Germaine?
It's me, Mother.
nbsp
Cousin Georges took me to Viel...
on his way to market.
nbsp
At this time of day?
nbsp
He had a load of pigs...
so I got a lift part-way.
nbsp
You had no dinner.
I'll make coffee.
nbsp
I'm tired, I just want to sleep.
Let me be.
nbsp
You're a lunatic!
nbsp
What have you done?
nbsp
Do something!
nbsp
What have you done?
nbsp
I tried to restore her to God... nbsp
Are you responsible...?
What's happened?
nbsp
I tried to restore her to God... nbsp
Bringing a dying girl to the altar...
a relic from the past.
nbsp
Father Donissan will enter the Trappist monastery.
nbsp
Later we'll find a suitable parish for him.
nbsp
You baffle me.
nbsp
I'm used to wisdom from you.
Wisdom is the vice of the old.
nbsp
Here's the "Imitation of Christ" with your annotations... nbsp
You made it yours.
nbsp
Soon there'll be no way I can help you.
nbsp
No!
I'll remember you even in Satan's arms.
nbsp
I didn't teach you blasphemy.
nbsp
That wasn't blasphemy.
nbsp
I was shown man's misery and Satan's power for a reason.
nbsp
You began with too much self-mortification.
nbsp
You threw yourself into the ministry!
nbsp
You were pleased with yourself.
You should have found peace.
nbsp
You haven't.
nbsp
God never refuses peace.
You're rejecting it.
nbsp
I suspect you've made some dangerous vow.
nbsp
I've made no vow...no promise..
nbsp barely a wish... nbsp
It's poisoning your heart.
nbsp
You like that picture, no?
nbsp
Very much.
nbsp
So many souls possessed by sin...
that enraged me.
nbsp
To save them, I offered all I had... nbsp
My life, first...it's not much...
My salvation, if God wants it.
nbsp
You risk damnation by straying from the path, as you've done.
nbsp
The spirit of evil has entered your life.
Fools ignore such things, some priests daren't utter Satan's name!
nbsp
Inner life today is a battlefield of instincts.
nbsp
Morality?
Hygiene of the senses.
Temptation is a mere carnal appetite.
People want only what's pleasant and useful... nbsp
There's nothing for a saint in such a world...or he's called mad!
nbsp
Are we truly so wretched?
nbsp
You're surely not meant for a cloister
Your retreat will be a time of better trial and moral loneliness.
nbsp
It will last longer than you think.
nbsp
Hope is almost dead in you!
nbsp
You'll be alone on your chosen road!
I didn't ask for that!
Let me live and die in humility!
nbsp
What was begun here will not be finished!
nbsp
We'll miss you.
nbsp
You weren't born to please.
The world hates your taste for strength...
Will you ever vanquish the distrust, pity, and opposition... of others?
They'll never let go of you.
nbsp
Who'll stop me from being what I was?
I attract no attention.
I've the reputation I deserve.
nbsp
If you let me, I could pass unnoticed...
Unnoticed!
God's work in us is seldom what we expect.
He seems to get things wrong, to waste time.
nbsp
God wears us down!
nbsp
How old I feel!
nbsp
And how...unsuited for it...
I'll never learn to be old!
nbsp
Poor pastor of Lumbres...
He's good for nothing!
nbsp
So many nights like last night, until the final night!
nbsp
I can no longer love.
nbsp
Does my life have a meaning?
nbsp
Never any rest... nbsp
They've pushed me to the brink... nbsp
Beyond it...silence, nbsp true silence!
nbsp
To die... nbsp
In the parlor, Father... nbsp
It's Mr Havret, about his sick son.
nbsp
Which one?
nbsp
Father, I've come to get you.
nbsp
Since last night my son's been paralyzed.
nbsp
The doctor said there's no hope; meningitis!
nbsp
My wife begged me to come for you We must go, Father.
nbsp
It's not my parish.
nbsp
You've a priest at Luzarnes.
nbsp
I'm touched that Mrs Havret thought of me...poor woman!
nbsp
Let's go.
nbsp
Marthe!
I have to go to Luzarnes.
nbsp
Not on an empty stomach...
I'll make coffee.
nbsp
Stay, Father, don't leave us!
nbsp
Pierre!
nbsp
I'm ashamed.
nbsp
Forgive this poor woman's ignorance.
nbsp
I have great esteem for you.
nbsp
Pray for me!
nbsp
Don't tempt me!
nbsp
Let's go out.
nbsp
I can't go on...
I'm a poor priest... nbsp ...a wretched blind man... nbsp
Don't say that...
Your imagination, fatigue... nbsp
Why'd I leave her...?
nbsp
What greater pain than the death of a child?
Nothing's worse.
nbsp
As I stood before her, I thought... nbsp
What?
nbsp
Nothing... nbsp
Only that inner voice... nbsp
I knew...
I still know..
nbsp
I'm sure that a word from me would have... nbsp revived... nbsp that dead child... nbsp
Look at me, answer me frankly... nbsp
Who stopped you from testing your power?
nbsp
I don't know... nbsp
Follow me in, I'll find some excuse... nbsp
Go to where the body lies... nbsp
I'll try... nbsp
You think me insane.
nbsp
Not long ago, I'd have wished for it... nbsp
Be careful, Sabroux...
You haven't understood me.
nbsp
He is there... nbsp
He is in our conscience...
He is our conscience!
nbsp
Men like you!
nbsp
Satan is prince of this world, he holds it in his hands.
nbsp
He is here, victorious!
nbsp
You understand?
nbsp
We are conquered, I tell you.
nbsp
And God is conquered with us.
nbsp
What blasphemy!
nbsp
Leave me...
Don't listen to me..
nbsp
Leave you!
Nothing is impossible for a man like you.
nbsp
I'll follow you.
God inspired you... nbsp
Restore the child to its mother.
nbsp
God is mocking me.
nbsp
Say who is master, him or You?
nbsp
Show yourself before abandoning me forever!
nbsp
O Father, I would have sacrificed even eternal life!
nbsp
I accept Your sovreign decision.
nbsp
He's alive!
nbsp
You are a saint!
nbsp
One day you'll know, you'll understand... nbsp
I hope for your forgiveness...
Forgive me... nbsp
My God!
Do not forsake me!
nbsp
Father Donissan will be glad to see you.
He's out just now.
nbsp
He's visiting a sick child.
And you know how he is... nbsp
Yes, I do...
He arrived here by cart one evening, with his few possessions, a bedframe, some odds and ends, his clothes and books...
It was very foggy...
He had a hard time finding the village.
Next day, he rang the bells, so the village knew it had a priest.
nbsp
The presbytery was in ruins.
nbsp
The wind swept through the walls, nbsp
Tons of rubble had to be removed.
nbsp
He worked with the laborers, he fixed it all himself.
nbsp
He hasn't changed.
nbsp
I got here later.
nbsp to look after him and the house.
nbsp
Downstairs, that is;
I never go up to his room.
nbsp
From the start, he said he'd deal with that himself.
nbsp
I don't even make his bed.
nbsp
He speaks of you every day.
nbsp
Father... nbsp
Your pain is barren, Satan.
nbsp
When did I first yield?
nbsp
You suffered, nbsp you prayed with me.
nbsp
Even that miracle... nbsp
Don't mark our time, Lord.
nbsp
Our attention wavers... nbsp
Lord... nbsp if I'm still useful, nbsp don't take me from this world.
nbsp
He's so pale!
nbsp
In the name of the Father, the son and the holy Ghost.
Amen.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
nbsp
I confess to Almighty God, to Blessed Mary, ever Virgin, to St. Michael the Archangel, to Blessed John the Baptist, the Holy Apostles...
Peter and Paul, and to all the Saints, and to you, Father, that I have sinned exceedingly in thought, word, deed, and omission...
With you it all seems simple.
Alone, I'm worthless.
I'm like a zero ;
only useful with other numbers.
Priests are so wretched.
They spend their lives seeing God humiliated.
People make fun of me.
I'm like a wall covered with obscenities.
You're weary.
Weariness is an evil thought.
Suspend your visits.
I do more harm than good.
At first I didn't know what evil was.
I learned it from the mouths of sinners.
No one knows better than a priest.
...the awful monotony of sin
I can't talk to them.
I can only absolve or weep.
If one absolution in thirty did its work... the world would soon be converted.
You're silent tonight, Estelle
Still no coffee at night, Father Donissan?
No thanks, Dean
I'll take mine in the next room.
I've been waiting for you.
I know
I want the Bishop to return me to the monastery.
Please back me up.
Why?
I don't belong here.
Parish work is too much for me.
My superiors thought so.
You do, too.
I'm willing to request your recall, but it's complicated.
Are you overtaxed here?
Don't be childish.
The parish is too poor to feed a useless mouth.
Perhaps I could go to the Trappists for a while.
Trappists!
You all want to go there!
A monastery's no rest home.
What should I do?
Now you're showing sense.
If you can't guide others, how can you judge yourself?
You've been given a master ; me!
I know it...
You were allowed to take holy orders... despite your superior's doubts.
I am not totally incapable of parish work fitting my intelligence.
Luckily, my health...
Health is God's gift.
I know its price too well.
Your strength and manual skills.
Suggest you were meant for a humbler vocation.
It's never too late to admit an error.
Should you try something else, or return to your plow?
I'm asking, not answering.
A man like me is easy to size up.
You're being tactful.
I'm eager to obey.
Don't keep me in suspense.
I know you're impatient.
But what you hope I'll say maybe be too great a temptation.
You want my decree.
Will you obey it?
I'm not just a crude, ignorant priest, unable to make himself loved.
I was a poor seminary student.
It took a miracle... to get me admitted to the priesthood.
I lack intelligence, memory, diligence.
Yet I can't overcome my stubbornness.
Your submission touches me...
I must have seemed cruel.
I'm going to be even more so.
Do you know whose hands you've put yourself in?
Please...
The hands of a man you don't respect!
I seem to live like a wealthy layman.
You're ashamed of my leisurely ways, admit it.
You know fools praise my experience...
You think it's sterile, of no use to anyone.
That's how you see it, no?
The thought was unintentional...
That's not an excuse.
Now you know my wicked mind... and now...
My dear boy!
I thought so!
My boy, our Lord is not displeased with you...
Burn this devilish thing tomorrow.
We'll find something better.
Your mortification is misplaced.
A proper priest wears white linen.
You know, my boy.
Your opinion of me is by and large correct... but it errs on one point.
I judge myself harshly.
I'm reaching my end empty-handed.
You're very different from me.
You've changed me!
I sent for you dreaming naively of bringing in a young priest with poor grades, lacking the qualities I so prize, and shaping him.
This was a heavy burden to take on.
But you are shaping me!
I need you!
[I]They[/I] didn't see the gift the Holy Spirit gave you.
[I]They[/I] never see anything!
God appoints us.
The spirit of strength is within you!
Anyone but me, assuming he'd seen as clearly, wouldn't dare speak to you as I do.
Human prudence is a trap.
Truth will out.
Sanctity!
My pronouncing that word pains you, I know.
You know what the word means ;
a vocation, a calling.
You must climb to where God calls you, or be lost.
Expect no human help.
Doubting your powers and God's aims led you into a blind alley.
I'm setting you back on your road.
I am giving you to those who will prey on you!
May the Lord bless you!
Allow me to withdraw.
Listening to you, I felt despair, but not any more.
Only you, God, may judge me as I am.
A man knows what is happening within him.
It's an impenetrable secret to anyone else.
Father Donissan?
You'll be late.
Are you ill?
No, Dean.
I won't be a minute.
It's me!
What a situation!
You come here at 1 A.M. after your father's visit...
You deserve a spanking.
I'm tired.
I fell in the mud, I'm soaked.
My throat's dry from crying.
I was out of my mind.
They'd have ended by killing me.
What parents!
They'll never see me again!
Nonsense.
I've got money.
I can catch a train to Paris.
My aunt has a nice house and a grocery store.
I'll work for her and be very happy.
Are you of age?
I will be, in time.
Let me stay!
Stay?
Where?
They'll all be on our backs...
including Gallet.
That damn Deputy!
I was seeing him tomorrow with Dad.
Mouchette, I've got enough problems...
I need time.
They say your furniture's the finest around.
Will you answer me?
Answer what?
Answer what!
You can't move in here.
It'd stir up a storm.
It's late.
I'll take you part-way back.
I won't go to Campagne tonight.
Where will you sleep?
Here, by the road, anywhere...
Do I care?
Sleep wherever.
You should've given me time.
In a month, I'd have sold all this.
But your father threatened me...
Because you blabbed, like at confession...
Don't cry... please don't cry.
Why are you crying?
I didn't mean what I said.
I can imagine your bully of a father...
Did he whip you?
I didn't tell him a thing.
- Why wasn't I told?
- You wouldn't have believed me.
Come on, it's over.
You don't believe me?
I don't believe you?
I've done a lot of thinking in the last week.
But it all just became clear.
Life, that is.
I hardly knew myself...
Me, Germaine...
I take pleasure in anything, sunshine... any silly thing.
But deep down there's a longing for something else.
But what?
Something you must have, nothing else matters.
We girls would say:
"He gets the prettiest ones"
So I thought, "Why not me?
It's my turn"
And now my dad scared you...
You're pitiful!
What did I do wrong?
Listen...
If I can sell the mill at Brimeux, I'll have 30,000 francs after settling my debts.
10,000 for you, 20,000 for me.
Keep your money.
You need it more than I do.
Alright, turn down my money.
But don't spit at me.
I'm not ashamed of poverty.
Neither am I. And I didn't ask for anything.
You didn't, but your father...
What's that got to do with me?
He lied ;
I didn't give you away!
Last night when he said that, I was furious!
I could've stuck my scissors in my throat... to spite him!
You two don't know me.
Trouble's just starting.
I'm wrong to get angry...
Take me to Paris... anywhere...
After the baby's born.
The baby!
My father lied to you and you believed him.
Shut up!
If he did, I'll break his neck!
Once everything's sold, I'll find us a place.
Think I'll settle for a country cottage?
At my age?
For a life of rural excitement!
If you don't want me, I have ideas of my own...
I know the perfect man...
Who?
...who'll refuse me nothing...
he's rich... educated... a scientist...
A Deputy...
Yes, a Deputy.
Gallet!
What a catch!
He has two kids and an ambitious wife.
You have big ideas for your age!
Well, your father sells lousy beer.
And you sell what you've got!
Gallet's mistress...
and under Papa's nose!
He'll set me up in Paris.
Yes, with a pretty room and freedom!
A Deputy's mistress...
Next a Minister's...
then the president's!
Laugh!
...
Why not me?
Alright...
You can stay till tomorrow.
But tell me the truth;
have you and Gallet...?
Yes, I've slept with him.
Come here!
Little bitch!
What are you doing?
Answer me!
Put that down!
You hear me, Mouchette?
You're a pest!
Why are you here?
I'm pregnant.
It doesn't show yet.
How long?
About 3 months.
You only admit it now?
"Admit" Big word!
Undress... in my office.
I'll freeze in there!
I won't leave tonight.
I told Dad I was going to my aunt's
Your wife's back tomorrow, no?
Your rashness will be our ruin.
We used to only meet out of town.
Now you make up and lie.
Scared?
Ever known women like me?
It's fun to be beautiful.
A new suitor is always handsome.
But a suitor who never tires of us is even handsomer.
That's how you look at me.
Men are so sad.
We grow too used to them to notice.
You didn't examine me!
I will now.
Another time.
Anyway, I know more about it than anyone.
In 6 months I'll be a "proud mother",
This pregnancy seems unlikely.
You love me?
I ask because of an idea I have.
What idea?
Do you love me?
Answer me!
Don't give me that!
Tell me you love me.
You don't dare say it?
Scared?
You hate me, but less than I do.
You don't know about self-hate.
About what?
Hate and contempt...
you've never felt that.
It's like an idea that you get...
you want to sink... into a pit where the contempt of fools can't reach you.
I used to be afraid... of a word, a look, anything...
That Rageot woman really hurt me once.
I was crossing the Planques bridge.
She grabbed her niece away, as if I had the plague.
You feel ashamed...
Whoever you sleep with...
Sometimes, at night, a few paces from my snoring father...
I, scorned buy everyone, but for what?
...
I get up, I listen...
my little body feels so strong...
I go to the window, as if drawn by a voice outside...
I wait...
I'm ready...
I must be insane...
You're over emotional...
Let me examine you...
I've changed my mind.
All right.
I suspect you've been pregnant longer than you say.
There's no hiding from Science!
I didn't lie to you.
It doesn't show yet.
I know you won't let me down.
What do you mean?
I'm not stupid.
I know it's easy for you people.
One, two, three and it's gone.
Love won't make me lose my head.
What you're asking is illegal and I won't do it.
Then don't...
I'll go to Boulogne!
All I'm asking is a trifle!
You can leave if you want.
Don't let me go.
Don't throw me out today.
Usually, I'm not scared...
This is the first time.
I also want to apologize.
I was so unpleasant just now.
If you'd made me go, I'd have been back.
Because I need you.
Not for what you think.
Let's not squabble over a baby that'll never be born.
I need you because you're the only man I don't lie to.
Think that's nothing?
You're wrong!
I lie all the time, I can't help it.
Even as a kid I hated my lies.
With you I can be natural, as I want to be.
Why aren't we like animals?
They live and die unthinkingly
Oxen calmly chew hay before they're slaughtered.
I envy that.
If I'd put you out, where'd you have gone?
To kill myself.
I pictured a place.
...at Vauroux pond to drown myself.
You can see the chateau from there.
It's silly, I know..
What are you scared of?
Sometimes my wife comes home without warning.
Do you believe in hell?
Mouchette, don't be silly!
Stop it!
you can be so annoying!
You believe in hell?
Of course not.
I knew it.
You fear your wife, but not hell.
You're so stupid!
Enough!
Shut up or leave!
Now you wish you'd put Mouchette out.
She'd be in the pond now.
Her little mouth full of mud, safely silent.
Coward!
You fear your wife, but not me!
Why not me?
Because you're a good girl.
No doubt.
From Mouchette you want only pleasure.
You just proved that.
But Mouchette's baby...!
It's not my child!
I didn't ask you to recognize it.
We're both at the bottom of the same pit.
What pit?
Who suspects Mr. Gallet makes love to a girl of 16?
Two-timing your wife here is half your fun.
You like troubled water.
In my Vauroux pond I see odd creatures..
Like centipedes, only longer.
They float on the clear surface, then suddenly dive.
A cloud of mud rises.
We're like those bugs.
Hidden from the fools by a cloud...
our big secret.
When you realize that, we'll love each other.
What do you mean?
Listen...
You're not the father!
Guess who is?
Cadignan... the Marquis de Cadignan!
Kiss my hand!
Go on, kiss my hand!
It's the hand that killed him.
This is insane!
You're upset and having an early pregnancy.
Is this a joke?
Believe what you like!
I killed him.
What day?
The 27th
What time?
5 A.M. I can still see the clock.
I took his gun.
It was on the table.
I didn't know it was loaded.
I fired when the muzzle touched him.
Convinced now?
The inquest is over, the verdict given.
I'm not judging you.
Seducing minors has its drawbacks.
I'm your friend.
You can talk to me.
You didn't go home on the night of the 26th?
What a question!
Your father?
Asleep.
Sneaking out was easy.
- How'd you get back?
- Same way.
But the next day, when they heard...?
They thought it was suicide, as everyone did.
You killed him and ran away?
To the pond, to wash my shoes.
I examined the body.
It looked like suicide.
Such close range...
Under the chin...
I was so much shorter than he...
He came right toward me...
He wasn't scared...
It weighed too much on my mind.
You're mad!
I don't believe a word of it!
It's true!
I can't live or breathe because of that awful lie.
Now I've told all!
You had a bad dream, Mouchette.
If I doubt my own mind..
What can I believe?
Why reject the word of a repentant killer?
I do repent.
If you doubt my "dream" I'll tell it to everyone.
Alright, let's drop it.
I scared you, huh?
A bit.
You're so nervous and impulsive right now.
Don't worry.
I've seen nothing, heard nothing.
You've nothing to fear from anyone.
What's that mean?
True or not, your story's like a dream.
No one saw you go out or come back.
No witnesses.
No bloodstains, no evidence.
It'd be just as silly if I said I did it.
Chatter, chatter...
Be serious.
Think you deserve absolution?
We'd give you God without confession, but God, He knows...
We've a baby to baptize...
Sunday.
That possible?
Of course.
Father Donissan will do it.
What do you say that flusters our people so?
When I talk of you, they can't meet my eye.
I'm sending you to Etapies to help the priest there retire.
It's 8 miles on foot along the road.
Dean, you're wanted...
Coming!
You like to walk, unless you want to take the train...
I'll give you my coat.
You'll freeze in your cassock.
A dark night, eh?
We're still a long way from daybreak.
Darkness draws folks together.
It daunts the wiliest.
If you met me by day, you'd pass right by.
Come from Etaples?
Going where?
To Campagne.
I won't go all the way.
We'll cut across country.
Thanks for your kindness and charity.
My cassock frightens some people.
Ignoramuses!
Illiterate yokels!
You see them at fairs and markets all over the North.
My uncle, my mother's brother, is a priest.
I know this area well.
Live around here?
I don't live anywhere I travel for a horse trader.
I was on the coast yesterday, but I'm moving inland.
No time to take root.
You married?
To poverty.
I haven't time to think of that!
I move around, never stay put.
Look out!
Come, come...
May the Lord repay your trouble.
He put you in my path when my courage flagged.
This has been a long...
hard night for me,
more than you can imagine.
Etaples to Campagne...
10 miles of bad roads!
My short-cut has saved us over a mile.
Here's the Chalindry road.
I won't go that far with you.
You in a hurry?
I've already lost too much time.
If you like, we can spend the night at my place.
I mean... there's a hut at the edge of the woods...
Belongs to a charcoal-burner.
We can make a fire.
Stop for a moment.
You've walked a long way.
You're worn out.
Forgive my weakness.
I'm ashamed to be seen like this.
A poor priest like me, trying... to solace the poor, to bolster their courage... when God deserts me..
I saw you before, walking on all fours.
You saw me?
Don't be embarrassed.
You're exhausted.
You've overdone it.
Patience...
that's a good remedy, preacher.
Less drastic than some, but surer.
Patience...
It's not fatigue.
I'm sturdy, I can fight a long time... but not against some things...
Lean on me.
I'm your friend.
I love you dearly.
I have no friends.
Rest...
I sought you...
hunted you ardently...
A friend's kiss.
A trifle!
I've kissed others..
Lots of others!
Want to know something?
I kiss you all!
You bear me in your flesh...
None of you escapes me!
I'm leaving you...
You'll never see me again!
Cling to your obstinacy!
If you knew the fate your master plans for you...
We alone are not fooled!
We chose his hate, not his love!
Why enlighten your muddy brain about this, cringing dog, enslaved brute?
That's enough now!
It's time we split up!
What did you want of me?
To test you...
From now until you die.
God assigns the test.
I'll wait for it!
I don't want to hear about it now...
and from such a mouth!
Seeing us is scary, eh?
Look me in the eye...
You'll recognize yourself!
See how transparent you are?
Back, Satan!
To know oneself!
See oneself!
Who hasn't dreamed of such a vision?
So perfect an image...
Not like in a mirror!
Every thought's there, from start to finish!
Your conscience is trained to examine itself, but it can never achieve such insight!
You can grasp only one thought at a time.
Man never fully knows what's going on in himself.
You see yourself in enigmas, not clearly!
- Look!
-
All your thoughts are here, in detail... the endless web that links them...
You know your whole life!
Go away!
How can you refuse such a vision?
I don't need that!
I don't want to know myself this way!
I'm sure you already wish you did!
Have I any time left?
Answer me!
Am I going to die here?
Then if I live a day or 20 years, I'll tear your secret from you!
I'll follow you if I must!
I don't fear you!
I'll nail you like an owl to the center of my prayer!
Your prayers don't scare me!
You were graced tonight.
You'll pay heavily for it...
my dear exorcist!
What grace?
You'll see!
What grace!
Your curiosity lost you!
You'll see a few others as you saw yourself.
I held you to my breast.
I took you in my arms.
I cradled you.
You will often fondle me, thinking you're fondling [I]the other!
[/I]
You are marked now... with the sign of my hatred!
Who are you?
What do you want?
I'm a quarryman in St. Pre.
Feeling better?
You'd fainted.
A horse dealer found you before I did.
The two of us put you here.
You saw him?
He's here?
Shall I call him?
No thanks...
I need to stretch my legs.
You know him?
Who?
...
Yeah, last month he sold me two fillies.
We can walk a ways together.
If you're tired, get a carriage at Sansonnet's.
You alright?
We're here, Father.
You go straight ahead.
I could come with you...
No, the walk did me good.
You're back, Marquis?
Oh, it's just you.
What do you want?
Stopping people at this hour!
I came the long way...
Odd?
Not really.
I can't sleep nights.
A man of God who hides in the bushes to peek at girls?
You don't think it's funny!
I love to laugh.
Is that forbidden?
We don't have much to say.
You assume I just left my lover.
You're not entirely wrong.
Let's walk.
You have nothing to fear from me...
I'm glad we met up...
It's not too late...
Maybe too soon.
I didn't seek you.
I came a long way round to meet you.
To draw you away; you know the dead man you await is not here.
What dead man?
When I saw you...
I saw God in your heart.
Don't be ashamed.
No sermons!
They mean nothing to me.
Harsher ordeals await you.
How old are you?
You should know, since you know so much!
Till now you've lived like a child.
Who won't forgive a child?
God helps us even in our madness.
Even when we curse Him, He supports us.
What do you want with a girl like me, a child?
You won't meet many in your choirs like me.
You'll save on holy water!
May your God spare you what I've been through!
You feel special.
I think you've never left the beaten path.
Why did sin seem so worth the trouble to you?
You're an odd priest.
So being evil is nothing...
even if...
Forget that.
To God, you are not guilty of that murder.
You are Satan's toy.
Satan!
I have the power to see inside you.
I now know your story as well as you do, Germaine Malorthy.
I know every twist and turn, every thought...
Pull yourself together...
You're exhausted...
You've said enough.
Said enough?
What have I said?
Nothing!
You spoke at length...
I spoke?
That's impossible.
What right have you...?
I have no right over you.
If God...
- God!
-
God's a joke...
God means nothing.
I didn't mean to offend you.
You lied to me just now?
I said nothing.
Did I?
You can't refuse to answer.
I must know.
To find out, I'll do anything you want...
Now you know...
I admitted everything...
So what?
I have nothing to fear.
Did I really talk in my sleep?
I saw you.
As no other person was ever seen.
Now you can never escape me.
Does your sin horrify me?
You offended God no more than animals do...
Your only sin was a fetus.
Look inside yourself..
The vice you're so proud of has died there...
Your heart's filled with self-loathing.
You've found only vain dreams..
You think you've killed a man.
Poor girl!
Later you crawled to a man baser than the first.
Whom you scorn and who fears you.
You can't escape him;
you told of your crime.
I can't escape him...
Yes, I can.
Whenever I want.
People thought me insane.
I didn't deny it.
I was waiting to be ready.
You never will be.
Think you're free?
Only God could free you.
Your life repeats other lives, all alike.
Lived like troughs where cattle feed.
Your actions betray your heredity.
God lets me see those from whom you spring.
Truly...
I have seen you in them, them in you.
All those faces blend into the face of vice.
Their actions become an act of murder.
Evil everywhere, that's your generation.
Hundreds of men and women linked by the same cancer...
You saw yourself in your family, as one of the herd.
Nothing you've done was not done before.
No thought, that wasn't already buried with the dead.
Only age-old actions.
Not similar; exactly alike.
Not repeated; unique!
You feel the vast deceit of your life?
You hear the laughter of your deceiver?
Your wretched ancestors have claimed you as their own.
And you surrender all.
You're feeding them your own life.
What can you do?
They've left their sins in your child's heart.
Back already?
Made a fool of myself again...
I got lost.
You reached Etaples too late?
Confession was over?
There's more to it...
Arrive late, alright, but not get there at all...?
What will they say?
Too bad.
I'll write to Etaples tonight.
I didn't lose my way.
I took the main road and left it only briefly.
By going straight ahead, I couldn't miss it, even at night.
I didn't get there.
Even stranger... worse...
an ordeal awaited me.
Go on.
God twice let me see through a body to the soul.
Not by ordinary means, but...
by a special grace...
Which you see as a miracle?
I think so.
Report it to your bishop.
I've awaited a supernatural sign of God's plan for you.
The sign has come.
Now I'm more puzzled than ever;
the sign is ambiguous... the miracle isn't pure.
There's more.
I met Germaine Malorthy...
I had a vision...
a certainty... that she killed the Marquis de Cadignan.
Her only consolation is to revisit the places she can't forget... the silent walls where her mute witness waits...
She confessed it all.
Harsher ordeals are in store for her.
She's desperate...
It may outweigh her remorse...
If you've misjudged and harmed that girl... what an awful responsibility!
I can't let you behave like that in the parish.
I can't trust you!
We must follow the infallible word and no other!
Did you help her?
That you, Germaine?
It's me, Mother.
Cousin Georges took me to Viel...
on his way to market.
At this time of day?
He had a load of pigs...
so I got a lift part-way.
You had no dinner.
I'll make coffee.
I'm tired, I just want to sleep.
Let me be.
You're a lunatic!
What have you done?
Do something!
What have you done?
I tried to restore her to God...
Are you responsible...?
What's happened?
I tried to restore her to God...
Bringing a dying girl to the altar...
a relic from the past.
Father Donissan will enter the Trappist monastery.
Later we'll find a suitable parish for him.
You baffle me.
I'm used to wisdom from you.
Wisdom is the vice of the old.
Here's the "Imitation of Christ" with your annotations...
You made it yours.
Soon there'll be no way I can help you.
No!
I'll remember you even in Satan's arms.
I didn't teach you blasphemy.
That wasn't blasphemy.
I was shown man's misery and Satan's power for a reason.
You began with too much self-mortification.
You threw yourself into the ministry!
You were pleased with yourself.
You should have found peace.
You haven't.
God never refuses peace.
You're rejecting it.
I suspect you've made some dangerous vow.
I've made no vow... no promise..
Barely a wish...
It's poisoning your heart.
You like that picture, no?
Very much.
So many souls possessed by sin...
that enraged me.
To save them, I offered all I had...
My life, first... it's not much...
My salvation, if God wants it.
You risk damnation by straying from the path, as you've done.
The spirit of evil has entered your life.
Fools ignore such things, some priests daren't utter Satan's name!
Inner life today is a battlefield of instincts.
Morality?
Hygiene of the senses.
Temptation is a mere carnal appetite.
People want only what's pleasant and useful...
There's nothing for a saint in such a world... or he's called mad!
Are we truly so wretched?
You're surely not meant for a cloister
Your retreat will be a time of better trial and moral loneliness.
It will last longer than you think.
Hope is almost dead in you!
You'll be alone on your chosen road!
I didn't ask for that!
Let me live and die in humility!
What was begun here will not be finished!
We'll miss you.
You weren't born to please.
The world hates your taste for strength...
Will you ever vanquish the distrust, pity, and opposition... of others?
They'll never let go of you.
Who'll stop me from being what I was?
I attract no attention.
I've the reputation I deserve.
If you let me, I could pass unnoticed...
Unnoticed!
God's work in us is seldom what we expect.
He seems to get things wrong, to waste time.
God wears us down!
How old I feel!
And how... unsuited for it...
I'll never learn to be old!
Poor pastor of Lumbres...
He's good for nothing!
So many nights like last night, until the final night!
I can no longer love.
Does my life have a meaning?
Never any rest...
They've pushed me to the brink...
Beyond it... silence, true silence!
To die...
In the parlor, Father...
It's Mr. Havret, about his sick son.
Which one?
Father, I've come to get you.
Since last night my son's been paralyzed.
The doctor said there's no hope; meningitis!
My wife begged me to come for you We must go, Father.
It's not my parish.
You've a priest at Luzarnes.
I'm touched that Mrs. Havret thought of me... poor woman!
Let's go.
Marthe!
I have to go to Luzarnes.
Not on an empty stomach...
I'll make coffee.
Stay, Father, don't leave us!
Pierre!
I'm ashamed.
Forgive this poor woman's ignorance.
I have great esteem for you.
Pray for me!
Don't tempt me!
Let's go out.
I can't go on...
I'm a poor priest a wretched blind man...
Don't say that...
Your imagination, fatigue...
Why'd I leave her...?
What greater pain than the death of a child?
Nothing's worse.
As I stood before her, I thought...
What?
Nothing...
Only that inner voice...
I knew...
I still know..
I'm sure that a word from me would have... revived... that dead child...
Look at me, answer me frankly...
Who stopped you from testing your power?
I don't know...
Follow me in, I'll find some excuse...
Go to where the body lies...
I'll try...
You think me insane.
Not long ago, I'd have wished for it...
Be careful, Sabroux...
You haven't understood me.
He is there...
He is in our conscience...
He is our conscience!
Men like you!
Satan is prince of this world, he holds it in his hands.
He is here, victorious!
You understand?
We are conquered, I tell you.
And God is conquered with us.
What blasphemy!
Leave me...
Don't listen to me..
Leave you!
Nothing is impossible for a man like you.
I'll follow you.
God inspired you...
Restore the child to its mother.
God is mocking me.
Say who is master, him or You?
Show yourself before abandoning me forever!
O Father, I would have sacrificed even eternal life!
I accept Your sovereign decision.
He's alive!
You are a saint!
One day you'll know, you'll understand...
I hope for your forgiveness...
Forgive me...
My God!
Do not forsake me!
Father Donissan will be glad to see you.
He's out just now.
He's visiting a sick child.
And you know how he is...
Yes, I do...
He arrived here by cart one evening, with his few possessions, a bed frame, some odds and ends, his clothes and books...
It was very foggy...
He had a hard time finding the village.
Next day, he rang the bells, so the village knew it had a priest.
The presbytery was in ruins.
The wind swept through the walls,
Tons of rubble had to be removed.
He worked with the laborers, he fixed it all himself.
He hasn't changed.
I got here later.
To look after him and the house.
Downstairs, that is;
I never go up to his room.
From the start, he said he'd deal with that himself.
I don't even make his bed.
He speaks of you every day.
Father...
Your pain is barren, Satan.
When did I first yield?
You suffered, you prayed with me.
Even that miracle...
Don't mark our time, Lord.
Our attention wavers...
Lord... if I'm still useful,
don't take me from this world.
He's so pale!
In the name of the Father, the son and the holy Ghost.
Amen.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
I confess to Almighty God, to Blessed Mary, ever Virgin, to St. Michael the Archangel, to Blessed John the Baptist, the Holy Apostles...
Peter and Paul, and to all the Saints, and to you, Father, that I have sinned exceedingly in thought, word, deed, and omission...
With you it all seems simple.
Alone, I'm worthless.
I'm like a zero ;
only useful with other numbers.
Priests are so wretched.
They spend their lives seeing God humiliated.
People make fun of me.
I'm like a wall covered with obscenities.
You're weary.
Weariness is an evil thought.
Suspend your visits.
I do more harm than good.
At first I didn't know what evil was.
I learned it from the mouths of sinners.
No one knows better than a priest.
...the awful monotony of sin
I can't talk to them.
I can only absolve or weep.
If one absolution in thirty did its work... the world would soon be converted.
You're silent tonight, Estelle
Still no coffee at night, Father Donissan?
No thanks, Dean
I'll take mine in the next room.
I've been waiting for you.
I know
I want the Bishop to return me to the monastery.
Please back me up.
Why?
I don't belong here.
Parish work is too much for me.
My superiors thought so.
You do, too.
I'm willing to request your recall, but it's complicated.
Are you overtaxed here?
Don't be childish.
The parish is too poor to feed a useless mouth.
Perhaps I could go to the Trappists for a while.
Trappists!
You all want to go there!
A monastery's no rest home.
What should I do?
Now you're showing sense.
If you can't guide others, how can you judge yourself?
You've been given a master ; me!
I know it...
You were allowed to take holy orders... despite your superior's doubts.
I am not totally incapable of parish work fitting my intelligence.
Luckily, my health...
Health is God's gift.
I know its price too well.
Your strength and manual skills.
suggest you were meant for a humbler vocation.
It's never too late to admit an error.
Should you try something else, or return to your plow?
I'm asking, not answering.
A man like me is easy to size up.
You're being tactful.
I'm eager to obey.
Don't keep me in suspense.
I know you're impatient.
But what you hope I'll say maybe be too great a temptation.
You want my decree.
Will you obey it?
I'm not just a crude, ignorant priest, unable to make himself loved.
I was a poor seminary student.
It took a miracle... to get me admitted to the priesthood.
I lack intelligence, memory, diligence.
Yet I can't overcome my stubbornness.
Your submission touches me...
I must have seemed cruel.
I'm going to be even more so.
Do you know whose hands you've put yourself in?
Please...
The hands of a man you don't respect!
I seem to live like a wealthy layman.
You're ashamed of my leisurely ways, admit it.
You know fools praise my experience...
You think it's sterile, of no use to anyone.
That's how you see it, no?
The thought was unintentional...
That's not an excuse.
Now you know my wicked mind... and now...
My dear boy!
I thought so!
My boy, our Lord is not displeased with you...
Burn this devilish thing tomorrow.
We'll find something better.
Your mortification is misplaced.
a proper priest wears white linen.
You know, my boy.
your opinion of me is by and large correct... but it errs on one point:
I judge myself harshly.
I'm reaching my end empty-handed.
You're very different from me.
You've changed me!
I sent for you dreaming naively of bringing in a young priest with poor grades, lacking the qualities I so prize, and shaping him.
This was a heavy burden to take on.
But you are shaping me!
I need you!
[i]They[/i] didn't see the gift the Holy Spirit gave you.
[i]They[/i] never see anything!
God appoints us.
The spirit of strength is within you!
Anyone but me, assuming he'd seen as clearly, wouldn't dare speak to you as I do.
Human prudence is a trap.
Truth will out.
Sanctity!
My pronouncing that word pains you, I know.
You know what the word means ;
a vocation, a calling.
You must climb to where God calls you, or be lost.
Expect no human help.
Doubting your powers and God's aims led you into a blind alley.
I'm setting you back on your road.
I am giving you to those who will prey on you!
May the Lord bless you!
Allow me to withdraw.
Listening to you, I felt despair, but not any more.
Only you, God, may judge me as I am.
A man knows what is happening within him.
It's an impenetrable secret to anyone else.
Father Donissan?
You'll be late.
Are you ill?
No, Dean.
I won't be a minute.
It's me!
What a situation!
You come here at 1 A.M. after your father's visit...
You deserve a spanking.
I'm tired.
I fell in the mud, I'm soaked.
My throat's dry from crying.
I was out of my mind.
They'd have ended by killing me.
What parents!
They'll never see me again!
Nonsense.
I've got money.
I can catch a train to Paris.
My aunt has a nice house and a grocery store.
I'll work for her and be very happy.
Are you of age?
I will be, in time.
Let me stay!
Stay?
Where?
They'll all be on our backs...
including Gallet.
that damn Deputy!
I was seeing him tomorrow with Dad.
Mouchette, I've got enough problems...
I need time.
They say your furniture's the finest around.
Will you answer me?
Answer what?
Answer what!
You can't move in here.
It'd stir up a storm.
It's late.
I'll take you part-way back.
I won't go to Campagne tonight.
Where'll you sleep?
Here, by the road, anywhere...
Do I care?
Sleep wherever.
You should've given me time.
In a month, I'd have sold all this.
But your father threatened me...
Because you blabbed, like at confession...
Don't cry...please don't cry.
Why are you crying?
I didn't mean what I said.
I can imagine your bully of a father...
Did he whip you?
I didn't tell him a thing.
-Why wasn't I told?
-You wouldn't have believed me.
Come on, it's over.
You don't believe me?
I don't believe you?
I've done a lot of thinking in the last week.
But it all just became clear.
Life, that is.
I hardly knew myself...
Me, Germaine...
I take pleasure in anything, sunshine...any silly thing.
But deep down there's a longing for something else.
But what?
Something you must have, nothing else matters.
We girls'd say:
"He gets the prettiest ones"
So I thought, "Why not me?
It's my turn"
And now my dad scared you...
You're pitiful!
What did I do wrong?
Listen...
If I can sell the mill at Brimeux, I'll have 30,000 francs after settling my debts.
10,000 for you, 20,000 for me.
Keep your money.
You need it more than I do.
Alright, turn down my money.
But don't spit at me.
I'm not ashamed of poverty.
Neither am I. And I didn't ask for anything.
You didn't, but your father...
What's that got to do with me?
He lied ;
I didn't give you away!
Last night when he said that, I was furious!
I could've stuck my scissors in my throat...to spite him!
You two don't know me.
Trouble's just starting.
I'm wrong to get angry...
Take me to Paris...anywhere...
After the baby's born.
The baby!
My father lied to you and you believed him.
Shut up!
If he did, I'll break his neck!
Once everything's sold, I'll find us a place.
Think I'll settle for a country cottage?
At my age?
For a life of rural excitement!
If you don't want me, I have ideas of my own...
I know the perfect man...
Who?
...who'll refuse me nothing...
he's rich...educated...a scientist...
A Deputy...
Yes, a Deputy.
Gallet!
What a catch!
He has two kids and an ambitious wife.
You have big ideas for your age!
Well, your father sells lousy beer.
and you sell what you've got!
Gallet's mistress...
and under Papa's nose!
He'll set me up in Paris.
Yes, with a pretty room and freedom!
A Deputy's mistress...
Next a Minister's...
then the president's!
Laugh!
...
Why not me?
Alright....
You can stay till tomorrow.
But tell me the truth;
have you and Gallet...?
Yes, I've slept with him.
Come here!
Little bitch!
What are you doing?
Answer me!
Put that down!
You hear me, Mouchette?
You're a pest!
Why are you here?
I'm pregnant.
It doesn't show yet.
How long?
About 3 months.
You only admit it now?
"Admit" Big word!
Undress...in my office.
I'll freeze in there!
I won't leave tonight.
I told Dad I was going to my aunt's
Your wife's back tomorrow, no?
Your rashness will be our ruin.
We used to only meet out of town.
Now you make up and lie.
Scared?
Ever known women like me?
It's fun to be beautiful.
A new suitor is always handsome.
But a suitor who never tires of us is even handsomer.
That's how you look at me.
Men are so sad.
We grow too used to them to notice.
You didn't examine me!
I will now.
Another time.
Anyway, I know more about it than anyone.
In 6 months I'll be a "proud mother",
This pregnancy seems unlikely.
You love me?
I ask because of an idea I have.
What idea?
Do you love me?
Answer me!
Don't give me that!
Tell me you love me.
You don't dare say it?
Scared?
You hate me, but less than I do.
You don't know about self-hate.
About what?
Hate and contempt...
you've never felt that.
It's like an idea that you get...
you want to sink... into a pit where the contempt of fools can't reach you.
I used to be afraid...of a word, a look, anything...
That Rageot woman really hurt me once.
I was crossing the Planques bridge.
She grabbed her niece away, as if I had the plague.
You feel ashamed...
Whoever you sleep with...
Sometimes, at night, a few paces from my snoring father...
I, scorned buy everyone, but for what?
...
I get up, I listen...
my little body feels so strong...
I go to the window, as if drawn by a voice outside...
I wait...
I'm ready...
I must be insane...
You're over emotional...
Let me examine you...
I've changed my mind.
All right.
I suspect you've been pregnant longer than you say.
There's no hiding from Science!
I didn't lie to you.
It doesn't show yet.
I know you won't let me down.
What do you mean?
I'm not stupid.
I know it's easy for you people.
One, two, three and it's gone.
Love won't make me lose my head.
What you're asking is illegal and I won't do it.
Then don't...
I'll go to Boulogne!
All I'm asking is a trifle!
You can leave if you want.
Don't let me go.
Don't throw me out today.
Usually, I'm not scared...
This is the first time.
I also want to apologize.
I was so unpleasant just now.
If you'd made me go, I'd have been back.
Because I need you.
Not for what you think.
Let's not squabble over a baby that'll never be born.
I need you because you're the only man I don't lie to.
Think that's nothing?
You're wrong!
I lie all the time, I can't help it.
Even as a kid I hated my lies.
With you I can be natural, as I want to be.
Why aren't we like animals?
They live and die unthinkingly
Oxen calmly chew hay before they're slaughtered.
I envy that.
If I'd put you out, where'd you have gone?
To kill myself.
I pictured a place.
...at Vauroux pond to drown myself.
You can see the chateau from there.
It's silly, I know..
What are you scared of?
Sometimes my wife comes home without warning.
Do you believe in hell?
Mouchette, don't be silly!
Stop it!
you can be so annoying!
You believe in hell?
Of course not.
I knew it.
You fear your wife, but not hell.
You're so stupid!
Enough!
Shut up or leave!
Now you wish you'd put Mouchette out.
She'd be in the pond now.
her little mouth full of mud, safely silent.
Coward!
You fear your wife, but not me!
Why not me?
Because you're a good girl.
No doubt.
From Mouchette you want only pleasure.
You just proved that.
But Mouchette's baby...!
It's not my child!
I didn't ask you to recognize it.
We're both at the bottom of the same pit.
What pit?
Who suspects Mr. Gallet makes love to a girl of 16?
Two-timing your wife here is half your fun.
You like troubled water.
In my Vauroux pond I see odd creatures..
Like centipedes, only longer.
They float on the clear surface, then suddenly dive.
A cloud of mud rises.
We're like those bugs.
Hidden from the fools by a cloud:
our big secret.
When you realize that, we'll love each other.
What do you mean?
Listen:
You're not the father!
Guess who is?
Cadignan...the Marquis de Cadignan!
Kiss my hand!
Go on, kiss my hand!
It's the hand that killed him.
This is insane!
You're upset and having an early pregnancy.
Is this a joke?
Believe what you like!
I killed him.
What day?
The 27th
What time?
5 A.M. I can still see the clock.
I took his gun.
It was on the table.
I didn't know it was loaded.
I fired when the muzzle touched him.
Convinced now?
The inquest is over, the verdict given.
I'm not judging you.
Seducing minors has its drawbacks.
I'm your friend.
You can talk to me.
You didn't go home on the night of the 26th?
What a question!
Your father?
Asleep.
Sneaking out was easy.
-How'd you get back?
-Same way.
But the next day, when they heard...?
They thought it was suicide, as everyone did.
You killed him and ran away?
To the pond, to wash my shoes.
I examined the body.
It looked like suicide.
Such close range...
Under the chin...
I was so much shorter than he...
He came right toward me...
He wasn't scared...
It weighed too much on my mind.
You're mad!
I don't believe a word of it!
It's true!
I can't live or breathe because of that awful lie.
Now I've told all!
You had a bad dream, Mouchette.
If I doubt my own mind..
what can I believe?
Why reject the word of a repentant killer?
I do repent.
If you doubt my "dream" I'll tell it to everyone.
Alright, let's drop it.
I scared you, huh?
A bit.
You're so nervous and impulsive right now.
Don't worry.
I've seen nothing, heard nothing.
You've nothing to fear from anyone.
What's that mean?
True or not, your story's like a dream.
No one saw you go out or come back.
No witnesses.
no bloodstains, no evidence.
It'd be just as silly if I said I did it.
Chatter, chatter...
Be serious.
Think you deserve absolution?
We'd give you God without confession, but God, He knows...
We've a baby to baptize...
Sunday.
That possible?
Of course.
Father Donissan will do it.
What do you say that flusters our people so?
When I talk of you, they can't meet my eye.
I'm sending you to Etapies to help the priest there retire.
It's 8 miles on foot along the road.
Dean, you're wanted...
Coming!
You like to walk, unless you want to take the train...
I'll give you my coat.
You'll freeze in your cassock.
A dark night, eh?
We're still a long way from daybreak.
Darkness draws folks together.
It daunts the wiliest.
If you met me by day, you'd pass right by.
Come from Etaples?
Going where?
To Campagne.
I won't go all the way.
We'll cut across country.
Thanks for your kindness and charity.
My cassock frightens some people.
Ignoramuses!
Illiterate yokels!
You see them at fairs and markets all over the North.
My uncle, my mother's brother, is a priest.
I know this area well.
Live around here?
I don't live anywhere I travel for a horse trader.
I was on the coast yesterday, but I'm moving inland.
No time to take root.
You married?
To poverty.
I haven't time to think of that!
I move around, never stay put.
Look out!
Come, come...
May the Lord repay your trouble.
He put you in my path when my courage flagged.
This has been a long...
hard night for me,
more than you can imagine.
Etaples to Campagne:
10 miles of bad roads!
My short-cut has saved us over a mile.
Here's the Chalindry road.
I won't go that far with you.
You in a hurry?
I've already lost too much time.
If you like, we can spend the night at my place.
I mean... there's a hut at the edge of the woods...
Belongs to a charcoal-burner.
We can make a fire.
Stop for a moment.
You've walked a long way.
You're worn out.
Forgive my weakness.
I'm ashamed to be seen like this.
A poor priest like me, trying... to solace the poor, to bolster their courage... when God deserts me..
I saw you before, walking on all fours.
You saw me?
Don't be embarrassed.
You're exhausted.
You've overdone it.
Patience...
that's a good remedy, preacher.
Less drastic than some, but surer.
Patience...
It's not fatigue.
I'm sturdy, I can fight a long time... but not against some things...
Lean on me.
I'm your friend.
I love you dearly.
I have no friends.
Rest...
I sought you...
hunted you ardently...
A friend's kiss.
A trifle!
I've kissed others..
lots of others!
Want to know something?
I kiss you all!
You bear me in your flesh...
None of you escapes me!
I'm leaving you...
You'll never see me again!
Cling to your obstinacy!
If you knew the fate your master plans for you...
We alone are not fooled!
We chose his hate, not his love!
Why enlighten your muddy brain about this, cringing dog, enslaved brute?
That's enough now!
It's time we split up!
What did you want of me?
To test you...
From now until you die.
God assigns the test.
I'll wait for it!
I don't want to hear about it now...
and from such a mouth!
Seeing us is scary, eh?
Look me in the eye...
You'll recognize yourself!
See how transparent you are?
Back, Satan!
To know oneself!
See oneself!
Who hasn't dreamed of such a vision?
So perfect an image...
Not like in a mirror!
Every thought's there, from start to finish!
Your conscience is trained to examine itself, but it can never achieve such insight!
You can grasp only one thought at a time.
Man never fully knows what's going on in himself.
You see yourself in enigmas, not clearly!
-Look!
-
All your thoughts are here, in detail... the endless web that links them...
You know your whole life!
Go away!
How can you refuse such a vision?
I don't need that!
I don't want to know myself this way!
I'm sure you already wish you did!
Have I any time left?
Answer me!
Am I going to die here?
Then if I live a day or 20 years, I'll tear your secret from you!
I'll follow you if I must!
I don't fear you!
I'll nail you like an owl to the center of my prayer!
Your prayers don't scare me!
You were graced tonight.
You'll pay heavily for it...
my dear exorcist!
What grace?
You'll see!
What grace!
Your curiosity lost you!
You'll see a few others as you saw yourself.
I held you to my breast.
I took you in my arms.
I cradled you.
You will often fondle me, thinking you're fondling [i]the other!
[/i]
You are marked now... with the sign of my hatred!
Who are you?
What do you want?
I'm a quarryman in St. Pre.
Feeling better?
You'd fainted.
A horse dealer found you before I did.
The two of us put you here.
You saw him?
He's here?
Shall I call him?
No thanks...
I need to stretch my legs.
You know him?
Who?
...
Yeah, last month he sold me two fillies.
We can walk a ways together.
If you're tired, get a carriage at Sansonnet's.
You alright?
We're here, Father.
You go straight ahead.
I could come with you...
No, the walk did me good.
You're back, Marquis?
Oh, it's just you.
What do you want?
Stopping people at this hour!
I came the long way...
Odd?
Not really.
I can't sleep nights.
A man of God who hides in the bushes to peek at girls?
You don't think it's funny!
I love to laugh.
Is that forbidden?
We don't have much to say.
You assume I just left my lover.
You're not entirely wrong.
Let's walk.
You have nothing to fear from me...
I'm glad we met up...
It's not too late...
Maybe too soon.
I didn't seek you.
I came a long way round to meet you.
To draw you away; you know the dead man you await is not here.
What dead man?
When I saw you...
I saw God in your heart.
Don't be ashamed.
No sermons!
They mean nothing to me.
Harsher ordeals await you.
How old are you?
You should know, since you know so much!
Till now you've lived like a child.
Who won't forgive a child?
God helps us even in our madness.
Even when we curse Him, He supports us.
What do you want with a girl like me, a child?
You won't meet many in your choirs like me.
You'll save on holy water!
May your God spare you what I've been through!
You feel special.
I think you've never left the beaten path.
Why did sin seem so worth the trouble to you?
You're an odd priest.
So being evil is nothing...
even if...
Forget that.
To God, you are not guilty of that murder.
You are Satan's toy.
Satan!
I have the power to see inside you.
I now know your story as well as you do, Germaine Malorthy.
I know every twist and turn, every thought...
Pull yourself together...
You're exhausted...
You've said enough.
Said enough?
What have I said?
Nothing!
You spoke at length...
I spoke?
That's impossible.
What right have you...?
I have no right over you.
If God...
- God!
-
God's a joke...
God means nothing.
I didn't mean to offend you.
You lied to me just now?
I said nothing.
Did I?
You can't refuse to answer.
I must know.
To find out, I'll do anything you want...
Now you know...
I admitted everything...
So what?
I have nothing to fear.
Did I really talk in my sleep?
I saw you.
As no other person was ever seen.
Now you can never escape me.
Does your sin horrify me?
You offended God no more than animals do...
Your only sin was a fetus.
Look inside yourself..
The vice you're so proud of has died there...
Your heart's filled with self-loathing.
You've found only vain dreams..
You think you've killed a man.
Poor girl!
Later you crawled to a man baser than the first.
Whom you scorn and who fears you.
You can't escape him;
you told of your crime.
I can't escape him...
Yes, I can.
Whenever I want.
People thought me insane.
I didn't deny it.
I was waiting to be ready.
You never will be.
Think you're free?
Only God could free you.
Your life repeats other lives, all alike.
Lived like troughs where cattle feed.
Your actions betray your heredity.
God lets me see those from whom you spring.
Truly...
I have seen you in them, them in you.
All those faces blend into the face of vice.
Their actions become an act of murder.
Evil everywhere, that's your generation.
Hundreds of men and women linked by the same cancer...
You saw yourself in your family, as one of the herd.
Nothing you've done was not done before.
No thought, that wasn't already buried with the dead.
Only age-old actions.
Not similar; exactly alike.
Not repeated; unique!
You feel the vast deceit of your life?
You hear the laughter of your deceiver?
Your wretched ancestors have claimed you as their own.
And you surrender all.
You're feeding them your own life.
What can you do?
They've left their sins in your child's heart.
Back already?
Made a fool of myself again:
I got lost.
You reached Etaples too late?
Confession was over?
There's more to it...
Arrive late, alright, but not get there at all...?
What will they say?
Too bad.
I'll write to Etaples tonight.
I didn't lose my way.
I took the main road and left it only briefly.
By going straight ahead, I couldn't miss it, even at night.
I didn't get there.
Even stranger...worse...
an ordeal awaited me.
Go on.
God twice let me see through a body to the soul.
Not by ordinary means, but...
by a special grace...
Which you see as a miracle?
I think so.
Report it to your bishop.
I've awaited a supernatural sign of God's plan for you.
The sign has come.
Now I'm more puzzled than ever;
the sign is ambiguous... the miracle isn't pure.
There's more.
I met Germaine Malorthy...
I had a vision...
a certainty...that she killed the Marquis de Cadignan.
Her only consolation is to revisit the places she can't forget... the silent walls where her mute witness waits...
She confessed it all.
Harsher ordeals are in store for her.
She's desperate...
It may outweigh her remorse...
If you've misjudged and harmed that girl... what an awful responsibility!
I can't let you behave like that in the parish.
I can't trust you!
We must follow the infallible word and no other!
Did you help her?
That you, Germaine?
It's me, Mother.
Cousin Georges took me to Viel...
on his way to market.
At this time of day?
He had a load of pigs...
so I got a lift part-way.
You had no dinner.
I'll make coffee.
I'm tired, I just want to sleep.
Let me be.
You're a lunatic!
What have you done?
Do something!
What have you done?
I tried to restore her to God...
Are you responsible...?
What's happened?
I tried to restore her to God...
Bringing a dying girl to the altar...
a relic from the past.
Father Donissan will enter the Trappist monastery.
Later we'll find a suitable parish for him.
You baffle me.
I'm used to wisdom from you.
Wisdom is the vice of the old.
Here's the "Imitation of Christ" with your annotations...
You made it yours.
Soon there'll be no way I can help you.
No!
I'll remember you even in Satan's arms.
I didn't teach you blasphemy.
That wasn't blasphemy.
I was shown man's misery and Satan's power for a reason.
You began with too much self-mortification.
You threw yourself into the ministry!
You were pleased with yourself.
You should have found peace.
You haven't.
God never refuses peace.
You're rejecting it.
I suspect you've made some dangerous vow.
I've made no vow...no promise..
barely a wish...
It's poisoning your heart.
You like that picture, no?
Very much.
So many souls possessed by sin...
that enraged me.
To save them, I offered all I had...
My life, first...it's not much...
My salvation, if God wants it.
You risk damnation by straying from the path, as you've done.
The spirit of evil has entered your life.
Fools ignore such things, some priests daren't utter Satan's name!
Inner life today is a battlefield of instincts.
Morality?
Hygiene of the senses.
Temptation is a mere carnal appetite.
People want only what's pleasant and useful...
There's nothing for a saint in such a world...or he's called mad!
Are we truly so wretched?
You're surely not meant for a cloister
Your retreat will be a time of better trial and moral loneliness.
It will last longer than you think.
Hope is almost dead in you!
You'll be alone on your chosen road!
I didn't ask for that!
Let me live and die in humility!
What was begun here will not be finished!
We'll miss you.
You weren't born to please.
The world hates your taste for strength...
Will you ever vanquish the distrust, pity, and opposition... of others?
They'll never let go of you.
Who'll stop me from being what I was?
I attract no attention.
I've the reputation I deserve.
If you let me, I could pass unnoticed...
Unnoticed!
God's work in us is seldom what we expect.
He seems to get things wrong, to waste time.
God wears us down!
How old I feel!
And how...unsuited for it...
I'll never learn to be old!
Poor pastor of Lumbres...
He's good for nothing!
So many nights like last night, until the final night!
I can no longer love.
Does my life have a meaning?
Never any rest...
They've pushed me to the brink...
Beyond it...silence, true silence!
To die...
In the parlor, Father...
It's Mr. Havret, about his sick son.
Which one?
Father, I've come to get you.
Since last night my son's been paralyzed.
The doctor said there's no hope; meningitis!
My wife begged me to come for you We must go, Father.
It's not my parish.
You've a priest at Luzarnes.
I'm touched that Mrs. Havret thought of me...poor woman!
Let's go.
Marthe!
I have to go to Luzarnes.
Not on an empty stomach...
I'll make coffee.
Stay, Father, don't leave us!
Pierre!
I'm ashamed.
Forgive this poor woman's ignorance.
I have great esteem for you.
Pray for me!
Don't tempt me!
Let's go out.
I can't go on...
I'm a poor priest a wretched blind man...
Don't say that...
Your imagination, fatigue...
Why'd I leave her...?
What greater pain than the death of a child?
Nothing's worse.
As I stood before her, I thought...
What?
Nothing...
Only that inner voice...
I knew...
I still know..
I'm sure that a word from me would have... revived... that dead child...
Look at me, answer me frankly...
Who stopped you from testing your power?
I don't know...
Follow me in, I'll find some excuse...
Go to where the body lies...
I'll try...
You think me insane.
Not long ago, I'd have wished for it...
Be careful, Sabroux...
You haven't understood me.
He is there...
He is in our conscience...
He is our conscience!
Men like you!
Satan is prince of this world, he holds it in his hands.
He is here, victorious!
You understand?
We are conquered, I tell you.
And God is conquered with us.
What blasphemy!
Leave me...
Don't listen to me..
Leave you!
Nothing is impossible for a man like you.
I'll follow you.
God inspired you...
Restore the child to its mother.
God is mocking me.
Say who is master, him or You?
Show yourself before abandoning me forever!
O Father, I would have sacrificed even eternal life!
I accept Your sovereign decision.
He's alive!
You are a saint!
One day you'll know, you'll understand...
I hope for your forgiveness...
Forgive me...
My God!
Do not forsake me!
Father Donissan will be glad to see you.
He's out just now.
He's visiting a sick child.
And you know how he is...
Yes, I do...
He arrived here by cart one evening, with his few possessions, a bed frame, some odds and ends, his clothes and books...
It was very foggy...
He had a hard time finding the village.
Next day, he rang the bells, so the village knew it had a priest.
The presbytery was in ruins.
The wind swept through the walls,
Tons of rubble had to be removed.
He worked with the laborers, he fixed it all himself.
He hasn't changed.
I got here later.
to look after him and the house.
Downstairs, that is;
I never go up to his room.
From the start, he said he'd deal with that himself.
I don't even make his bed.
He speaks of you every day.
Father...
Your pain is barren, Satan.
When did I first yield?
You suffered, you prayed with me.
Even that miracle...
Don't mark our time, Lord.
Our attention wavers...
Lord... if I'm still useful,
don't take me from this world.
He's so pale!
In the name of the Father, the son and the holy Ghost.
Amen.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
I confess to Almighty God, to Blessed Mary, ever Virgin, to St. Michael the Archangel, to Blessed John the Baptist, the Holy Apostles...
Peter and Paul, and to all the Saints, and to you, Father, that I have sinned exceedingly in thought, word, deed, and omission...
With you it all seems simple.
Alone, I'm worthless.
I'm like a zero;
only useful with other numbers.
Priests are so wretched.
They spend their lives seeing God humiliated.
People make fun of me.
I'm like a wall covered with obscenities.
You're weary.
Weariness is an evil thought.
Suspend your visits.
I do more harm than good.
At first I didn't know what evil was.
I learned it from the mouths of sinners.
No one knows better than a priest.
...the awful monotony of sin
I can't talk to them.
I can only absolve or weep.
If one absolution in thirty did its work... the world would soon be converted.
You're silent tonight, Estelle
Still no coffee at night, Father Donissan?
No thanks, Dean
I'll take mine in the next room.
I've been waiting for you.
I know
I want the Bishop to return me to the monastery.
Please back me up.
Why?
I don't belong here.
Parish work is too much for me.
My superiors thought so.
You do, too.
I'm willing to request your recall, but it's complicated.
Are you overtaxed here?
Don't be childish.
The parish is too poor to feed a useless mouth.
Perhaps I could go to the Trappists for a while.
Trappists!
You all want to go there!
A monastery's no rest home.
What should I do?
Now you're showing sense.
If you can't guide others, how can you judge yourself?
You've been given a master; me!
I know it...
You were allowed to take holy orders... despite your superior's doubts.
I am not totally incapable of parish work fitting my intelligence.
Luckily, my health...
Health is God's gift.
I know its price too well.
Your strength and manual skills.
suggest you were meant for a humbler vocation.
It's never too late to admit an error.
Should you try something else, or return to your plow?
I'm asking, not answering.
A man like me is easy to size up.
You're being tactful.
I'm eager to obey.
Don't keep me in suspense.
I know you're impatient.
But what you hope I'll say maybe be too great a temptation.
You want my decree.
Will you obey it?
I'm not just a crude, ignorant priest, unable to make himself loved.
I was a poor seminary student.
It took a miracle... to get me admitted to the priesthood.
I lack intelligence, memory, diligence.
Yet I can't overcome my stubbornness.
Your submission touches me...
I must have seemed cruel.
I'm going to be even more so.
Do you know whose hands you've put yourself in?
Please...
The hands of a man you don't respect!
I seem to live like a wealthy layman.
You're ashamed of my leisurely ways, admit it.
You know fools praise my experience...
You think it's sterile, of no use to anyone.
That's how you see it, no?
The thought was unintentional...
That's not an excuse.
Now you know my wicked mind... and now...
My dear boy!
I thought so!
My boy, our Lord is not displeased with you...
Burn this devilish thing tomorrow.
We'll find something better.
Your mortification is misplaced.
a proper priest wears white linen.
You know, my boy.
your opinion of me is by and large correct... but it errs on one point:
I judge myself harshly.
I'm reaching my end empty-handed.
You're very different from me.
You've changed me!
I sent for you dreaming naively of bringing in a young priest with poor grades, lacking the qualities I so prize, and shaping him.
This was a heavy burden to take on.
But you are shaping me!
I need you!
They didn't see the gift the Holy Spirit gave you.
They never see anything!
God appoints us.
The spirit of strength is within you!
Anyone but me, assuming he'd seen as clearly, wouldn't dare speak to you as I do.
Human prudence is a trap.
Truth will out.
Sanctity!
My pronouncing that word pains you, I know.
You know what the word means;
a vocation, a calling.
You must climb to where God calls you, or be lost.
Expect no human help.
Doubting your powers and God's aims led you into a blind alley.
I'm setting you back on your road.
I am giving you to those who will prey on you!
May the Lord bless you!
Allow me to withdraw.
Listening to you, I felt despair, but not any more.
Only you, God, may judge me as I am.
A man knows what is happening within him.
It's an impenetrable secret to anyone else.
Father Donissan?
You'll be late.
Are you ill?
No, Dean.
I won't be a minute.
It's me!
What a situation!
You come here at 1 A.M. after your father's visit...
You deserve a spanking.
I'm tired.
I fell in the mud, I'm soaked.
My throat's dry from crying.
I was out of my mind.
They'd have ended by killing me.
What parents!
They'll never see me again!
Nonsense.
I've got money.
I can catch a train to Paris.
My aunt has a nice house and a grocery store.
I'll work for her and be very happy.
Are you of age?
I will be, in time.
Let me stay!
Stay?
Where?
They'll all be on our backs...
including Gallet.
that damn Deputy!
I was seeing him tomorrow with Dad.
Mouchette, I've got enough problems...
I need time.
They say your furniture's the finest around.
Will you answer me?
Answer what?
Answer what!
You can't move in here.
It'd stir up a storm.
It's late.
I'll take you part-way back.
I won't go to Campagne tonight.
Where'll you sleep?
Here, by the road, anywhere...
Do I care?
Sleep wherever.
You should've given me time.
In a month, I'd have sold all this.
But your father threatened me...
Because you blabbed, like at confession...
Don't cry... please don't cry.
Why are you crying?
I didn't mean what I said.
I can imagine your bully of a father...
Did he whip you?
I didn't tell him a thing.
- Why wasn't I told?
- You wouldn't have believed me.
Come on, it's over.
You don't believe me?
I don't believe you?
I've done a lot of thinking in the last week.
But it all just became clear.
Life, that is.
I hardly knew myself...
Me, Germaine...
I take pleasure in anything, sunshine... any silly thing.
But deep down there's a longing for something else.
But what?
Something you must have, nothing else matters.
We girls'd say:
"He gets the prettiest ones"
So I thought, "Why not me?
It's my turn"
And now my dad scared you...
You're pitiful!
What did I do wrong?
Listen...
If I can sell the mill at Brimeux, I'll have 30,000 francs after settling my debts.
10,000 for you, 20,000 for me.
Keep your money.
You need it more than I do.
Alright, turn down my money.
But don't spit at me.
I'm not ashamed of poverty.
Neither am I. And I didn't ask for anything.
You didn't, but your father...
What's that got to do with me?
He lied;
I didn't give you away!
Last night when he said that, I was furious!
I could've stuck my scissors in my throat... to spite him!
You two don't know me.
Trouble's just starting.
I'm wrong to get angry...
Take me to Paris... anywhere...
After the baby's born.
The baby!
My father lied to you and you believed him.
Shut up!
If he did, I'll break his neck!
Once everything's sold, I'll find us a place.
Think I'll settle for a country cottage?
At my age?
For a life of rural excitement!
If you don't want me, I have ideas of my own...
I know the perfect man...
Who?
...who'll refuse me nothing...
he's rich... educated... a scientist...
A Deputy...
Yes, a Deputy.
Gallet!
What a catch!
He has two kids and an ambitious wife.
You have big ideas for your age!
Well, your father sells lousy beer.
and you sell what you've got!
Gallet's mistress...
and under Papa's nose!
He'll set me up in Paris.
Yes, with a pretty room and freedom!
A Deputy's mistress...
Next a Minister's...
then the president's!
Laugh!
...
Why not me?
Alright...
You can stay till tomorrow.
But tell me the truth;
have you and Gallet...?
Yes, I've slept with him.
Come here!
Little bitch!
What are you doing?
Answer me!
Put that down!
You hear me, Mouchette?
You're a pest!
Why are you here?
I'm pregnant.
It doesn't show yet.
How long?
About 3 months.
You only admit it now?
"Admit" Big word!
Undress... in my office.
I'll freeze in there!
I won't leave tonight.
I told Dad I was going to my aunt's
Your wife's back tomorrow, no?
Your rashness will be our ruin.
We used to only meet out of town.
Now you make up and lie.
Scared?
Ever known women like me?
It's fun to be beautiful.
A new suitor is always handsome.
But a suitor who never tires of us is even handsomer.
That's how you look at me.
Men are so sad.
We grow too used to them to notice.
You didn't examine me!
I will now.
Another time.
Anyway, I know more about it than anyone.
In 6 months I'll be a "proud mother",
This pregnancy seems unlikely.
You love me?
I ask because of an idea I have.
What idea?
Do you love me?
Answer me!
Don't give me that!
Tell me you love me.
You don't dare say it?
Scared?
You hate me, but less than I do.
You don't know about self-hate.
About what?
Hate and contempt...
you've never felt that.
It's like an idea that you get...
you want to sink... into a pit where the contempt of fools can't reach you.
I used to be afraid... of a word, a look, anything...
That Rageot woman really hurt me once.
I was crossing the Planques bridge.
She grabbed her niece away, as if I had the plague.
You feel ashamed...
Whoever you sleep with...
Sometimes, at night, a few paces from my snoring father...
I, scorned buy everyone, but for what?
...
I get up, I listen...
my little body feels so strong...
I go to the window, as if drawn by a voice outside...
I wait...
I'm ready...
I must be insane...
You're over emotional...
Let me examine you...
I've changed my mind.
All right.
I suspect you've been pregnant longer than you say.
There's no hiding from Science!
I didn't lie to you.
It doesn't show yet.
I know you won't let me down.
What do you mean?
I'm not stupid.
I know it's easy for you people.
One, two, three and it's gone.
Love won't make me lose my head.
What you're asking is illegal and I won't do it.
Then don't...
I'll go to Boulogne!
All I'm asking is a trifle!
You can leave if you want.
Don't let me go.
Don't throw me out today.
Usually, I'm not scared...
This is the first time.
I also want to apologize.
I was so unpleasant just now.
If you'd made me go, I'd have been back.
Because I need you.
Not for what you think.
Let's not squabble over a baby that'll never be born.
I need you because you're the only man I don't lie to.
Think that's nothing?
You're wrong!
I lie all the time, I can't help it.
Even as a kid I hated my lies.
With you I can be natural, as I want to be.
Why aren't we like animals?
They live and die unthinkingly
Oxen calmly chew hay before they're slaughtered.
I envy that.
If I'd put you out, where'd you have gone?
To kill myself.
I pictured a place.
...at Vauroux pond to drown myself.
You can see the chateau from there.
It's silly, I know..
What are you scared of?
Sometimes my wife comes home without warning.
Do you believe in hell?
Mouchette, don't be silly!
Stop it!
you can be so annoying!
You believe in hell?
Of course not.
I knew it.
You fear your wife, but not hell.
You're so stupid!
Enough!
Shut up or leave!
Now you wish you'd put Mouchette out.
She'd be in the pond now.
her little mouth full of mud, safely silent.
Coward!
You fear your wife, but not me!
Why not me?
Because you're a good girl.
No doubt.
From Mouchette you want only pleasure.
You just proved that.
But Mouchette's baby...!
It's not my child!
I didn't ask you to recognize it.
We're both at the bottom of the same pit.
What pit?
Who suspects Mr. Gallet makes love to a girl of 16?
Two-timing your wife here is half your fun.
You like troubled water.
In my Vauroux pond I see odd creatures..
Like centipedes, only longer.
They float on the clear surface, then suddenly dive.
A cloud of mud rises.
We're like those bugs.
Hidden from the fools by a cloud:
our big secret.
When you realize that, we'll love each other.
What do you mean?
Listen:
You're not the father!
Guess who is?
Cadignan... the Marquis de Cadignan!
Kiss my hand!
Go on, kiss my hand!
It's the hand that killed him.
This is insane!
You're upset and having an early pregnancy.
Is this a joke?
Believe what you like!
I killed him.
What day?
The 27th
What time?
5 A.M. I can still see the clock.
I took his gun.
It was on the table.
I didn't know it was loaded.
I fired when the muzzle touched him.
Convinced now?
The inquest is over, the verdict given.
I'm not judging you.
Seducing minors has its drawbacks.
I'm your friend.
You can talk to me.
You didn't go home on the night of the 26th?
What a question!
Your father?
Asleep.
Sneaking out was easy.
- How'd you get back?
- Same way.
But the next day, when they heard...?
They thought it was suicide, as everyone did.
You killed him and ran away?
To the pond, to wash my shoes.
I examined the body.
It looked like suicide.
Such close range...
Under the chin...
I was so much shorter than he...
He came right toward me...
He wasn't scared...
It weighed too much on my mind.
You're mad!
I don't believe a word of it!
It's true!
I can't live or breathe because of that awful lie.
Now I've told all!
You had a bad dream, Mouchette.
If I doubt my own mind..
what can I believe?
Why reject the word of a repentant killer?
I do repent.
If you doubt my "dream" I'll tell it to everyone.
Alright, let's drop it.
I scared you, huh?
A bit.
You're so nervous and impulsive right now.
Don't worry.
I've seen nothing, heard nothing.
You've nothing to fear from anyone.
What's that mean?
True or not, your story's like a dream.
No one saw you go out or come back.
No witnesses.
no bloodstains, no evidence.
It'd be just as silly if I said I did it.
Chatter, chatter...
Be serious.
Think you deserve absolution?
We'd give you God without confession, but God, He knows...
We've a baby to baptize...
Sunday.
That possible?
Of course.
Father Donissan will do it.
What do you say that flusters our people so?
When I talk of you, they can't meet my eye.
I'm sending you to Etapies to help the priest there retire.
It's 8 miles on foot along the road.
Dean, you're wanted...
Coming!
You like to walk, unless you want to take the train...
I'll give you my coat.
You'll freeze in your cassock.
A dark night, eh?
We're still a long way from daybreak.
Darkness draws folks together.
It daunts the wiliest.
If you met me by day, you'd pass right by.
Come from Etaples?
Going where?
To Campagne.
I won't go all the way.
We'll cut across country.
Thanks for your kindness and charity.
My cassock frightens some people.
Ignoramuses!
Illiterate yokels!
You see them at fairs and markets all over the North.
My uncle, my mother's brother, is a priest.
I know this area well.
Live around here?
I don't live anywhere I travel for a horse trader.
I was on the coast yesterday, but I'm moving inland.
No time to take root.
You married?
To poverty.
I haven't time to think of that!
I move around, never stay put.
Look out!
Come, come...
May the Lord repay your trouble.
He put you in my path when my courage flagged.
This has been a long...
hard night for me,
more than you can imagine.
Etaples to Campagne:
10 miles of bad roads!
My short-cut has saved us over a mile.
Here's the Chalindry road.
I won't go that far with you.
You in a hurry?
I've already lost too much time.
If you like, we can spend the night at my place.
I mean... there's a hut at the edge of the woods...
Belongs to a charcoal-burner.
We can make a fire.
Stop for a moment.
You've walked a long way.
You're worn out.
Forgive my weakness.
I'm ashamed to be seen like this.
A poor priest like me, trying... to solace the poor, to bolster their courage... when God deserts me..
I saw you before, walking on all fours.
You saw me?
Don't be embarrassed.
You're exhausted.
You've overdone it.
Patience...
that's a good remedy, preacher.
Less drastic than some, but surer.
Patience...
It's not fatigue.
I'm sturdy, I can fight a long time... but not against some things...
Lean on me.
I'm your friend.
I love you dearly.
I have no friends.
Rest...
I sought you...
hunted you ardently...
A friend's kiss.
A trifle!
I've kissed others..
lots of others!
Want to know something?
I kiss you all!
You bear me in your flesh...
None of you escapes me!
I'm leaving you...
You'll never see me again!
Cling to your obstinacy!
If you knew the fate your master plans for you...
We alone are not fooled!
We chose his hate, not his love!
Why enlighten your muddy brain about this, cringing dog, enslaved brute?
That's enough now!
It's time we split up!
What did you want of me?
To test you...
From now until you die.
God assigns the test.
I'll wait for it!
I don't want to hear about it now...
and from such a mouth!
Seeing us is scary, eh?
Look me in the eye...
You'll recognize yourself!
See how transparent you are?
Back, Satan!
To know oneself!
See oneself!
Who hasn't dreamed of such a vision?
So perfect an image...
Not like in a mirror!
Every thought's there, from start to finish!
Your conscience is trained to examine itself, but it can never achieve such insight!
You can grasp only one thought at a time.
Man never fully knows what's going on in himself.
You see yourself in enigmas, not clearly!
- Look!
-
All your thoughts are here, in detail... the endless web that links them...
You know your whole life!
Go away!
How can you refuse such a vision?
I don't need that!
I don't want to know myself this way!
I'm sure you already wish you did!
Have I any time left?
Answer me!
Am I going to die here?
Then if I live a day or 20 years, I'll tear your secret from you!
I'll follow you if I must!
I don't fear you!
I'll nail you like an owl to the center of my prayer!
Your prayers don't scare me!
You were graced tonight.
You'll pay heavily for it...
my dear exorcist!
What grace?
You'll see!
What grace!
Your curiosity lost you!
You'll see a few others as you saw yourself.
I held you to my breast.
I took you in my arms.
I cradled you.
You will often fondle me, thinking you're fondling the other!
You are marked now... with the sign of my hatred!
Who are you?
What do you want?
I'm a quarryman in St. Pre.
Feeling better?
You'd fainted.
A horse dealer found you before I did.
The two of us put you here.
You saw him?
He's here?
Shall I call him?
No thanks...
I need to stretch my legs.
You know him?
Who?
...
Yeah, last month he sold me two fillies.
We can walk a ways together.
If you're tired, get a carriage at Sansonnet's.
You alright?
We're here, Father.
You go straight ahead.
I could come with you...
No, the walk did me good.
You're back, Marquis?
Oh, it's just you.
What do you want?
Stopping people at this hour!
I came the long way...
Odd?
Not really.
I can't sleep nights.
A man of God who hides in the bushes to peek at girls?
You don't think it's funny!
I love to laugh.
Is that forbidden?
We don't have much to say.
You assume I just left my lover.
You're not entirely wrong.
Let's walk.
You have nothing to fear from me...
I'm glad we met up...
It's not too late...
Maybe too soon.
I didn't seek you.
I came a long way round to meet you.
To draw you away; you know the dead man you await is not here.
What dead man?
When I saw you...
I saw God in your heart.
Don't be ashamed.
No sermons!
They mean nothing to me.
Harsher ordeals await you.
How old are you?
You should know, since you know so much!
Till now you've lived like a child.
Who won't forgive a child?
God helps us even in our madness.
Even when we curse Him, He supports us.
What do you want with a girl like me, a child?
You won't meet many in your choirs like me.
You'll save on holy water!
May your God spare you what I've been through!
You feel special.
I think you've never left the beaten path.
Why did sin seem so worth the trouble to you?
You're an odd priest.
So being evil is nothing...
even if...
Forget that.
To God, you are not guilty of that murder.
You are Satan's toy.
Satan!
I have the power to see inside you.
I now know your story as well as you do, Germaine Malorthy.
I know every twist and turn, every thought...
Pull yourself together...
You're exhausted...
You've said enough.
Said enough?
What have I said?
Nothing!
You spoke at length...
I spoke?
That's impossible.
What right have you...?
I have no right over you.
If God...
- God!
-
God's a joke...
God means nothing.
I didn't mean to offend you.
You lied to me just now?
I said nothing.
Did I?
You can't refuse to answer.
I must know.
To find out, I'll do anything you want...
Now you know...
I admitted everything...
So what?
I have nothing to fear.
Did I really talk in my sleep?
I saw you.
As no other person was ever seen.
Now you can never escape me.
Does your sin horrify me?
You offended God no more than animals do...
Your only sin was a fetus.
Look inside yourself..
The vice you're so proud of has died there...
Your heart's filled with self-loathing.
You've found only vain dreams..
You think you've killed a man.
Poor girl!
Later you crawled to a man baser than the first.
Whom you scorn and who fears you.
You can't escape him;
you told of your crime.
I can't escape him...
Yes, I can.
Whenever I want.
People thought me insane.
I didn't deny it.
I was waiting to be ready.
You never will be.
Think you're free?
Only God could free you.
Your life repeats other lives, all alike.
Lived like troughs where cattle feed.
Your actions betray your heredity.
God lets me see those from whom you spring.
Truly...
I have seen you in them, them in you.
All those faces blend into the face of vice.
Their actions become an act of murder.
Evil everywhere, that's your generation.
Hundreds of men and women linked by the same cancer...
You saw yourself in your family, as one of the herd.
Nothing you've done was not done before.
No thought, that wasn't already buried with the dead.
Only age-old actions.
Not similar; exactly alike.
Not repeated; unique!
You feel the vast deceit of your life?
You hear the laughter of your deceiver?
Your wretched ancestors have claimed you as their own.
And you surrender all.
You're feeding them your own life.
What can you do?
They've left their sins in your child's heart.
Back already?
Made a fool of myself again:
I got lost.
You reached Etaples too late?
Confession was over?
There's more to it...
Arrive late, alright, but not get there at all...?
What will they say?
Too bad.
I'll write to Etaples tonight.
I didn't lose my way.
I took the main road and left it only briefly.
By going straight ahead, I couldn't miss it, even at night.
I didn't get there.
Even stranger... worse...
an ordeal awaited me.
Go on.
God twice let me see through a body to the soul.
Not by ordinary means, but...
by a special grace...
Which you see as a miracle?
I think so.
Report it to your bishop.
I've awaited a supernatural sign of God's plan for you.
The sign has come.
Now I'm more puzzled than ever;
the sign is ambiguous... the miracle isn't pure.
There's more.
I met Germaine Malorthy...
I had a vision...
a certainty... that she killed the Marquis de Cadignan.
Her only consolation is to revisit the places she can't forget... the silent walls where her mute witness waits...
She confessed it all.
Harsher ordeals are in store for her.
She's desperate...
It may outweigh her remorse...
If you've misjudged and harmed that girl... what an awful responsibility!
I can't let you behave like that in the parish.
I can't trust you!
We must follow the infallible word and no other!
Did you help her?
That you, Germaine?
It's me, Mother.
Cousin Georges took me to Viel...
on his way to market.
At this time of day?
He had a load of pigs...
so I got a lift part-way.
You had no dinner.
I'll make coffee.
I'm tired, I just want to sleep.
Let me be.
You're a lunatic!
What have you done?
Do something!
What have you done?
I tried to restore her to God...
Are you responsible...?
What's happened?
I tried to restore her to God...
Bringing a dying girl to the altar...
a relic from the past.
Father Donissan will enter the Trappist monastery.
Later we'll find a suitable parish for him.
You baffle me.
I'm used to wisdom from you.
Wisdom is the vice of the old.
Here's the "Imitation of Christ" with your annotations...
You made it yours.
Soon there'll be no way I can help you.
No!
I'll remember you even in Satan's arms.
I didn't teach you blasphemy.
That wasn't blasphemy.
I was shown man's misery and Satan's power for a reason.
You began with too much self-mortification.
You threw yourself into the ministry!
You were pleased with yourself.
You should have found peace.
You haven't.
God never refuses peace.
You're rejecting it.
I suspect you've made some dangerous vow.
I've made no vow... no promise..
barely a wish...
It's poisoning your heart.
You like that picture, no?
Very much.
So many souls possessed by sin...
that enraged me.
To save them, I offered all I had...
My life, first... it's not much...
My salvation, if God wants it.
You risk damnation by straying from the path, as you've done.
The spirit of evil has entered your life.
Fools ignore such things, some priests daren't utter Satan's name!
Inner life today is a battlefield of instincts.
Morality?
Hygiene of the senses.
Temptation is a mere carnal appetite.
People want only what's pleasant and useful...
There's nothing for a saint in such a world... or he's called mad!
Are we truly so wretched?
You're surely not meant for a cloister
Your retreat will be a time of better trial and moral loneliness.
It will last longer than you think.
Hope is almost dead in you!
You'll be alone on your chosen road!
I didn't ask for that!
Let me live and die in humility!
What was begun here will not be finished!
We'll miss you.
You weren't born to please.
The world hates your taste for strength...
Will you ever vanquish the distrust, pity, and opposition... of others?
They'll never let go of you.
Who'll stop me from being what I was?
I attract no attention.
I've the reputation I deserve.
If you let me, I could pass unnoticed...
Unnoticed!
God's work in us is seldom what we expect.
He seems to get things wrong, to waste time.
God wears us down!
How old I feel!
And how... unsuited for it...
I'll never learn to be old!
Poor pastor of Lumbres...
He's good for nothing!
So many nights like last night, until the final night!
I can no longer love.
Does my life have a meaning?
Never any rest...
They've pushed me to the brink...
Beyond it... silence, true silence!
To die...
In the parlor, Father...
It's Mr. Havret, about his sick son.
Which one?
Father, I've come to get you.
Since last night my son's been paralyzed.
The doctor said there's no hope; meningitis!
My wife begged me to come for you We must go, Father.
It's not my parish.
You've a priest at Luzarnes.
I'm touched that Mrs. Havret thought of me... poor woman!
Let's go.
Marthe!
I have to go to Luzarnes.
Not on an empty stomach...
I'll make coffee.
Stay, Father, don't leave us!
Pierre!
I'm ashamed.
Forgive this poor woman's ignorance.
I have great esteem for you.
Pray for me!
Don't tempt me!
Let's go out.
I can't go on...
I'm a poor priest a wretched blind man...
Don't say that...
Your imagination, fatigue...
Why'd I leave her...?
What greater pain than the death of a child?
Nothing's worse.
As I stood before her, I thought...
What?
Nothing...
Only that inner voice...
I knew...
I still know..
I'm sure that a word from me would have... revived... that dead child...
Look at me, answer me frankly...
Who stopped you from testing your power?
I don't know...
Follow me in, I'll find some excuse...
Go to where the body lies...
I'll try...
You think me insane.
Not long ago, I'd have wished for it...
Be careful, Sabroux...
You haven't understood me.
He is there...
He is in our conscience...
He is our conscience!
Men like you!
Satan is prince of this world, he holds it in his hands.
He is here, victorious!
You understand?
We are conquered, I tell you.
And God is conquered with us.
What blasphemy!
Leave me...
Don't listen to me..
Leave you!
Nothing is impossible for a man like you.
I'll follow you.
God inspired you...
Restore the child to its mother.
God is mocking me.
Say who is master, him or You?
Show yourself before abandoning me forever!
O Father, I would have sacrificed even eternal life!
I accept Your sovereign decision.
He's alive!
You are a saint!
One day you'll know, you'll understand...
I hope for your forgiveness...
Forgive me...
My God!
Do not forsake me!
Father Donissan will be glad to see you.
He's out just now.
He's visiting a sick child.
And you know how he is...
Yes, I do...
He arrived here by cart one evening, with his few possessions, a bed frame, some odds and ends, his clothes and books...
It was very foggy...
He had a hard time finding the village.
Next day, he rang the bells, so the village knew it had a priest.
The presbytery was in ruins.
The wind swept through the walls,
Tons of rubble had to be removed.
He worked with the laborers, he fixed it all himself.
He hasn't changed.
I got here later.
to look after him and the house.
Downstairs, that is;
I never go up to his room.
From the start, he said he'd deal with that himself.
I don't even make his bed.
He speaks of you every day.
Father...
Your pain is barren, Satan.
When did I first yield?
You suffered, you prayed with me.
Even that miracle...
Don't mark our time, Lord.
Our attention wavers...
Lord... if I'm still useful,
don't take me from this world.
He's so pale!
In the name of the Father, the son and the holy Ghost.
Amen.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
I confess to Almighty God, to Blessed Mary, ever Virgin, to St. Michael the Archangel, to Blessed John the Baptist, the Holy Apostles...
Peter and Paul, and to all the Saints, and to you, Father, that I have sinned exceedingly in thought, word, deed, and omission...
With you it all seems simple.
Alone, I'm worthless.
I'm like a zero:
only useful with other numbers.
Priests are so wretched.
They spend their lives seeing God humiliated.
People make fun of me.
I'm like a wall covered with obscenities.
You're weary.
Weariness is an evil thought.
Suspend your visits.
I do more harm than good.
At first I didn't know what evil was.
I learned it from the mouths of sinners.
No one knows better than a priest.
...the awful monotony of sin
I can't talk to them.
I can only absolve or weep.
If one absolution in thirty did its work... the world would soon be converted.
You're silent tonight, Estelle
Still no coffee at night, Father Donissan?
No thanks, Dean
I'll take mine in the next room.
I've been waiting for you.
I know
I want the Bishop to return me to the monastery.
Please back me up.
Why?
I don't belong here.
Parish work is too much for me.
My superiors thought so.
You do, too.
I'm willing to request your recall, but it's complicated.
Are you overtaxed here?
Don't be childish.
The parish is too poor to feed a useless mouth.
Perhaps I could go to the Trappists for a while.
Trappists!
You all want to go there!
A monastery's no rest home.
What should I do?
Now you're showing sense.
If you can't guide others, how can you judge yourself?
You've been given a master: me!
I know it...
You were allowed to take holy orders... despite your superior's doubts.
I am not totally incapable of parish work fitting my intelligence.
Luckily, my health...
Health is God's gift.
I know its price too well.
Your strength and manual skills.
suggest you were meant for a humbler vocation.
It's never too late to admit an error.
Should you try something else, or return to your plow?
I'm asking, not answering.
A man like me is easy to size up.
You're being tactful.
I'm eager to obey.
Don't keep me in suspense.
I know you're impatient.
But what you hope I'll say maybe be too great a temptation.
You want my decree.
Will you obey it?
I'm not just a crude, ignorant priest, unable to make himself loved.
I was a poor seminary student.
It took a miracle... to get me admitted to the priesthood.
I lack intelligence, memory, diligence.
Yet I can't overcome my stubbornness.
Your submission touches me...
I must have seemed cruel.
I'm going to be even more so.
Do you know whose hands you've put yourself in?
Please...
The hands of a man you don't respect!
I seem to live like a wealthy layman.
You're ashamed of my leisurely ways, admit it.
You know fools praise my experience...
You think it's sterile, of no use to anyone.
That's how you see it, no?
The thought was unintentional...
That's not an excuse.
Now you know my wicked mind... and now...
My dear boy!
I thought so!
My boy, our Lord is not displeased with you...
Burn this devilish thing tomorrow.
We'll find something better.
Your mortification is misplaced.
a proper priest wears white linen.
You know, my boy.
your opinion of me is by and large correct... but it errs on one point:
I judge myself harshly.
I'm reaching my end empty-handed.
You're very different from me.
You've changed me!
I sent for you dreaming naively of bringing in a young priest with poor grades, lacking the qualities I so prize, and shaping him.
This was a heavy burden to take on.
But you are shaping me!
I need you!
They didn't see the gift the Holy Spirit gave you.
They never see anything!
God appoints us.
The spirit of strength is within you!
Anyone but me, assuming he'd seen as clearly, wouldn't dare speak to you as I do.
Human prudence is a trap.
Truth will out.
Sanctity!
My pronouncing that word pains you, I know.
You know what the word means:
a vocation, a calling.
You must climb to where God calls you, or be lost.
Expect no human help.
Doubting your powers and God's aims led you into a blind alley.
I'm setting you back on your road.
I am giving you to those who will prey on you!
May the Lord bless you!
Allow me to withdraw.
Listening to you, I felt despair, but not any more.
Only you, God, may judge me as I am.
A man knows what is happening within him.
It's an impenetrable secret to anyone else.
Father Donissan?
You'll be late.
Are you ill?
No, Dean.
I won't be a minute.
It's me!
What a situation!
You come here at 1 a.m. after your father's visit...
You deserve a spanking.
I'm tired.
I fell in the mud, I'm soaked.
My throat's dry from crying.
I was out of my mind.
They'd have ended by killing me.
What parents!
They'll never see me again!
Nonsense.
I've got money.
I can catch a train to Paris.
My aunt has a nice house and a grocery store.
I'll work for her and be very happy.
Are you of age?
I will be, in time.
Let me stay!
Stay?
Where?
They'll all be on our backs...
including Gallet.
that damn Deputy!
I was seeing him tomorrow with Dad.
Mouchette, I've got enough problems...
I need time.
They say your furniture's the finest around.
Will you answer me?
Answer what?
Answer what!
You can't move in here.
It'd stir up a storm.
It's late.
I'll take you part-way back.
I won't go to Campagne tonight.
Where'll you sleep?
Here, by the road, anywhere...
Do I care?
Sleep wherever.
You should've given me time.
In a month, I'd have sold all this.
But your father threatened me...
Because you blabbed, like at confession...
Don't cry... please don't cry.
Why are you crying?
I didn't mean what I said.
I can imagine your bully of a father...
Did he whip you?
I didn't tell him a thing.
- Why wasn't I told?
- You wouldn't have believed me.
Come on, it's over.
You don't believe me?
I don't believe you?
I've done a lot of thinking in the last week.
But it all just became clear.
Life, that is.
I hardly knew myself...
Me, Germaine...
I take pleasure in anything, sunshine... any silly thing.
But deep down there's a longing for something else.
But what?
Something you must have, nothing else matters.
We girls'd say:
"He gets the prettiest ones"
So I thought, "Why not me?
It's my turn"
And now my dad scared you...
You're pitiful!
What did I do wrong?
Listen...
If I can sell the mill at Brimeux, I'll have 30,000 francs after settling my debts.
10,000 for you, 20,000 for me.
Keep your money.
You need it more than I do.
Alright, turn down my money.
But don't spit at me.
I'm not ashamed of poverty.
Neither am I. And I didn't ask for anything.
You didn't, but your father...
What's that got to do with me?
He lied.
I didn't give you away!
Last night when he said that, I was furious!
I could've stuck my scissors in my throat... to spite him!
You two don't know me.
Trouble's just starting.
I'm wrong to get angry...
Take me to Paris... anywhere...
After the baby's born.
The baby!
My father lied to you and you believed him.
Shut up!
If he did, I'll break his neck!
Once everything's sold, I'll find us a place.
Think I'll settle for a country cottage?
At my age?
For a life of rural excitement!
If you don't want me, I have ideas of my own...
I know the perfect man...
Who?
...who'll refuse me nothing...
he's rich... educated... a scientist...
A Deputy...
Yes, a Deputy.
Gallet!
What a catch!
He has two kids and an ambitious wife.
You have big ideas for your age!
Well, your father sells lousy beer.
and you sell what you've got!
Gallet's mistress...
and under Papa's nose!
He'll set me up in Paris.
Yes, with a pretty room and freedom!
A Deputy's mistress...
Next a Minister's...
then the president's!
Laugh!
...
Why not me?
Alright....
You can stay till tomorrow.
But tell me the truth:
Have you and Gallet...?
Yes, I've slept with him.
Come here!
Little bitch!
What are you doing?
Answer me!
Put that down!
You hear me, Mouchette?
You're a pest!
Why are you here?
I'm pregnant.
It doesn't show yet.
How long?
About 3 months.
You only admit it now?
"Admit" Big word!
Undress... in my office.
I'll freeze in there!
I won't leave tonight.
I told Dad I was going to my aunt's
Your wife's back tomorrow, no?
Your rashness will be our ruin.
We used to only meet out of town.
Now you make up and lie.
Scared?
Ever known women like me?
It's fun to be beautiful.
A new suitor is always handsome.
But a suitor who never tires of us is even handsomer.
That's how you look at me.
Men are so sad.
We grow too used to them to notice.
You didn't examine me!
I will now.
Another time.
Anyway, I know more about it than anyone.
In 6 months I'll be a "proud mother",
This pregnancy seems unlikely.
You love me?
I ask because of an idea I have.
What idea?
Do you love me?
Answer me!
Don't give me that!
Tell me you love me.
You don't dare say it?
Scared?
You hate me, but less than I do.
You don't know about self-hate.
About what?
Hate and contempt...
you've never felt that.
It's like an idea that you get...
you want to sink... into a pit where the contempt of fools can't reach you.
I used to be afraid... of a word, a look, anything...
That Rageot woman really hurt me once.
I was crossing the Planques bridge.
She grabbed her niece away, as if I had the plague.
You feel ashamed...
Whoever you sleep with...
Sometimes, at night, a few paces from my snoring father...
I, scorned buy everyone, but for what?
...
I get up, I listen...
my little body feels so strong...
I go to the window, as if drawn by a voice outside...
I wait...
I'm ready...
I must be insane...
You're over emotional...
Let me examine you...
I've changed my mind.
All right.
I suspect you've been pregnant longer than you say.
There's no hiding from Science!
I didn't lie to you.
It doesn't show yet.
I know you won't let me down.
What do you mean?
I'm not stupid.
I know it's easy for you people.
One, two, three and it's gone.
Love won't make me lose my head.
What you're asking is illegal and I won't do it.
Then don't...
I'll go to Boulogne!
All I'm asking is a trifle!
You can leave if you want.
Don't let me go.
Don't throw me out today.
Usually, I'm not scared...
This is the first time.
I also want to apologize.
I was so unpleasant just now.
If you'd made me go, I'd have been back.
Because I need you.
Not for what you think.
Let's not squabble over a baby that'll never be born.
I need you because you're the only man I don't lie to.
Think that's nothing?
You're wrong!
I lie all the time, I can't help it.
Even as a kid I hated my lies.
With you I can be natural, as I want to be.
Why aren't we like animals?
They live and die unthinkingly
Oxen calmly chew hay before they're slaughtered.
I envy that.
If I'd put you out, where'd you have gone?
To kill myself.
I pictured a place.
...at Vauroux pond to drown myself.
You can see the chateau from there.
It's silly, I know..
What are you scared of?
Sometimes my wife comes home without warning.
Do you believe in hell?
Mouchette, don't be silly!
Stop it!
you can be so annoying!
You believe in hell?
Of course not.
I knew it.
You fear your wife, but not hell.
You're so stupid!
Enough!
Shut up or leave!
Now you wish you'd put Mouchette out.
She'd be in the pond now.
her little mouth full of mud, safely silent.
Coward!
You fear your wife, but not me!
Why not me?
Because you're a good girl.
No doubt.
From Mouchette you want only pleasure.
You just proved that.
But Mouchette's baby...!
It's not my child!
I didn't ask you to recognize it.
We're both at the bottom of the same pit.
What pit?
Who suspects Mr. Gallet makes love to a girl of 16?
Two-timing your wife here is half your fun.
You like troubled water.
In my Vauroux pond I see odd creatures..
Like centipedes, only longer.
They float on the clear surface, then suddenly dive.
A cloud of mud rises.
We're like those bugs.
Hidden from the fools by a cloud:
our big secret.
When you realize that, we'll love each other.
What do you mean?
Listen:
You're not the father!
Guess who is?
Cadignan... the Marquis de Cadignan!
Kiss my hand!
Go on, kiss my hand!
It's the hand that killed him.
This is insane!
You're upset and having an early pregnancy.
Is this a joke?
Believe what you like!
I killed him.
What day?
The 27th
What time?
5 a.m. I can still see the clock.
I took his gun.
It was on the table.
I didn't know it was loaded.
I fired when the muzzle touched him.
Convinced now?
The inquest is over, the verdict given.
I'm not judging you.
Seducing minors has its drawbacks.
I'm your friend.
You can talk to me.
You didn't go home on the night of the 26th?
What a question!
Your father?
Asleep.
Sneaking out was easy.
- How'd you get back?
- Same way.
But the next day, when they heard...?
They thought it was suicide, as everyone did.
You killed him and ran away?
To the pond, to wash my shoes.
I examined the body.
It looked like suicide.
Such close range...
Under the chin...
I was so much shorter than he...
He came right toward me...
He wasn't scared...
It weighed too much on my mind.
You're mad!
I don't believe a word of it!
It's true!
I can't live or breathe because of that awful lie.
Now I've told all!
You had a bad dream, Mouchette.
If I doubt my own mind..
what can I believe?
Why reject the word of a repentant killer?
I do repent.
If you doubt my "dream" I'll tell it to everyone.
Alright, let's drop it.
I scared you, huh?
A bit.
You're so nervous and impulsive right now.
Don't worry.
I've seen nothing, heard nothing.
You've nothing to fear from anyone.
What's that mean?
True or not, your story's like a dream.
No one saw you go out or come back.
No witnesses.
no bloodstains, no evidence.
It'd be just as silly if I said I did it.
Chatter, chatter...
Be serious.
Think you deserve absolution?
We'd give you God without confession, but God, He knows...
We've a baby to baptize...
Sunday.
That possible?
Of course.
Father Donissan will do it.
What do you say that flusters our people so?
When I talk of you, they can't meet my eye.
I'm sending you to Etapies to help the priest there retire.
It's 8 miles on foot along the road.
Dean, you're wanted...
Coming!
You like to walk, unless you want to take the train...
I'll give you my coat.
You'll freeze in your cassock.
A dark night, eh?
We're still a long way from daybreak.
Darkness draws folks together.
It daunts the wiliest.
If you met me by day, you'd pass right by.
Come from Etaples?
Going where?
To Campagne.
I won't go all the way.
We'll cut across country.
Thanks for your kindness and charity.
My cassock frightens some people.
Ignoramuses!
Illiterate yokels!
You see them at fairs and markets all over the North.
My uncle, my mother's brother, is a priest.
I know this area well.
Live around here?
I don't live anywhere I travel for a horse trader.
I was on the coast yesterday, but I'm moving inland.
No time to take root.
You married?
To poverty.
I haven't time to think of that!
I move around, never stay put.
Look out!
Come, come...
May the Lord repay your trouble.
He put you in my path when my courage flagged.
This has been a long...
hard night for me,
more than you can imagine.
Etaples to Campagne:
10 miles of bad roads!
My short-cut has saved us over a mile.
Here's the Chalindry road.
I won't go that far with you.
You in a hurry?
I've already lost too much time.
If you like, we can spend the night at my place.
I mean... there's a hut at the edge of the woods...
Belongs to a charcoal-burner.
We can make a fire.
Stop for a moment.
You've walked a long way.
You're worn out.
Forgive my weakness.
I'm ashamed to be seen like this.
A poor priest like me, trying... to solace the poor, to bolster their courage... when God deserts me..
I saw you before, walking on all fours.
You saw me?
Don't be embarrassed.
You're exhausted.
You've overdone it.
Patience...
that's a good remedy, preacher.
Less drastic than some, but surer.
Patience...
It's not fatigue.
I'm sturdy, I can fight a long time... but not against some things...
Lean on me.
I'm your friend.
I love you dearly.
I have no friends.
Rest...
I sought you...
hunted you ardently...
A friend's kiss.
A trifle!
I've kissed others..
lots of others!
Want to know something?
I kiss you all!
You bear me in your flesh...
None of you escapes me!
I'm leaving you...
You'll never see me again!
Cling to your obstinacy!
If you knew the fate your master plans for you...
We alone are not fooled!
We chose his hate, not his love!
Why enlighten your muddy brain about this, cringing dog, enslaved brute?
That's enough now!
It's time we split up!
What did you want of me?
To test you...
From now until you die.
God assigns the test.
I'll wait for it!
I don't want to hear about it now...
and from such a mouth!
Seeing us is scary, eh?
Look me in the eye...
You'll recognize yourself!
See how transparent you are?
Back, Satan!
To know oneself!
See oneself!
Who hasn't dreamed of such a vision?
So perfect an image...
Not like in a mirror!
Every thought's there, from start to finish!
Your conscience is trained to examine itself, but it can never achieve such insight!
You can grasp only one thought at a time.
Man never fully knows what's going on in himself.
You see yourself in enigmas, not clearly!
Look!
-
All your thoughts are here, in detail... the endless web that links them...
You know your whole life!
Go away!
How can you refuse such a vision?
I don't need that!
I don't want to know myself this way!
I'm sure you already wish you did!
Have I any time left?
Answer me!
Am I going to die here?
Then if I live a day or 20 years, I'll tear your secret from you!
I'll follow you if I must!
I don't fear you!
I'll nail you like an owl to the center of my prayer!
Your prayers don't scare me!
You were graced tonight.
You'll pay heavily for it...
my dear exorcist!
What grace?
You'll see!
What grace!
Your curiosity lost you!
You'll see a few others as you saw yourself.
I held you to my breast.
I took you in my arms.
I cradled you.
You will often fondle me, thinking you're fondling the other!
You are marked now... with the sign of my hatred!
Who are you?
What do you want?
I'm a quarryman in St. Pre.
Feeling better?
You'd fainted.
A horse dealer found you before I did.
The two of us put you here.
You saw him?
He's here?
Shall I call him?
No thanks...
I need to stretch my legs.
You know him?
Who?
...
Yeah, last month he sold me two fillies.
We can walk a ways together.
If you're tired, get a carriage at Sansonnet's.
You alright?
We're here, Father.
You go straight ahead.
I could come with you...
No, the walk did me good.
You're back, Marquis?
Oh, it's just you.
What do you want?
Stopping people at this hour!
I came the long way...
Odd?
Not really.
I can't sleep nights.
A man of God who hides in the bushes to peek at girls?
You don't think it's funny!
I love to laugh.
Is that forbidden?
We don't have much to say.
You assume I just left my lover.
You're not entirely wrong.
Let's walk.
You have nothing to fear from me...
I'm glad we met up...
It's not too late...
Maybe too soon.
I didn't seek you.
I came a long way round to meet you.
To draw you away; you know the dead man you await is not here.
What dead man?
When I saw you...
I saw God in your heart.
Don't be ashamed.
No sermons!
They mean nothing to me.
Harsher ordeals await you.
How old are you?
You should know, since you know so much!
Till now you've lived like a child.
Who won't forgive a child?
God helps us even in our madness.
Even when we curse Him, He supports us.
What do you want with a girl like me, a child?
You won't meet many in your choirs like me.
You'll save on holy water!
May your God spare you what I've been through!
You feel special.
I think you've never left the beaten path.
Why did sin seem so worth the trouble to you?
You're an odd priest.
So being evil is nothing...
even if...
Forget that.
To God, you are not guilty of that murder.
You are Satan's toy.
Satan!
I have the power to see inside you.
I now know your story as well as you do, Germaine Malorthy.
I know every twist and turn, every thought...
Pull yourself together...
You're exhausted...
You've said enough.
Said enough?
What have I said?
Nothing!
You spoke at length...
I spoke?
That's impossible.
What right have you...?
I have no right over you.
If God...
God!
-
God's a joke...
God means nothing.
I didn't mean to offend you.
You lied to me just now?
I said nothing.
Did I?
You can't refuse to answer.
I must know.
To find out, I'll do anything you want...
Now you know...
I admitted everything...
So what?
I have nothing to fear.
Did I really talk in my sleep?
I saw you.
As no other person was ever seen.
Now you can never escape me.
Does your sin horrify me?
You offended God no more than animals do...
Your only sin was a fetus.
Look inside yourself..
The vice you're so proud of has died there...
Your heart's filled with self-loathing.
You've found only vain dreams..
You think you've killed a man.
Poor girl!
Later you crawled to a man baser than the first.
Whom you scorn and who fears you.
You can't escape him;
you told of your crime.
I can't escape him...
Yes, I can.
Whenever I want.
People thought me insane.
I didn't deny it.
I was waiting to be ready.
You never will be.
Think you're free?
Only God could free you.
Your life repeats other lives, all alike.
Lived like troughs where cattle feed.
Your actions betray your heredity.
God lets me see those from whom you spring.
Truly...
I have seen you in them, them in you.
All those faces blend into the face of vice.
Their actions become an act of murder.
Evil everywhere, that's your generation.
Hundreds of men and women linked by the same cancer...
You saw yourself in your family, as one of the herd.
Nothing you've done was not done before.
No thought, that wasn't already buried with the dead.
Only age-old actions.
Not similar, exactly alike.
Not repeated; unique!
You feel the vast deceit of your life?
You hear the laughter of your deceiver?
Your wretched ancestors have claimed you as their own.
And you surrender all.
You're feeding them your own life.
What can you do?
They've left their sins in your child's heart.
Back already?
Made a fool of myself again:
I got lost.
You reached Etaples too late?
Confession was over?
There's more to it...
Arrive late, alright, but not get there at all...?
What will they say?
Too bad.
I'll write to Etaples tonight.
I didn't lose my way.
I took the main road and left it only briefly.
By going straight ahead, I couldn't miss it, even at night.
I didn't get there.
Even stranger... worse...
an ordeal awaited me.
Go on.
God twice let me see through a body to the soul.
Not by ordinary means, but...
by a special grace...
Which you see as a miracle?
I think so.
Report it to your bishop.
I've awaited a supernatural sign of God's plan for you.
The sign has come.
Now I'm more puzzled than ever;
the sign is ambiguous... the miracle isn't pure.
There's more.
I met Germaine Malorthy...
I had a vision...
a certainty... that she killed the Marquis de Cadignan.
Her only consolation is to revisit the places she can't forget... the silent walls where her mute witness waits...
She confessed it all.
Harsher ordeals are in store for her.
She's desperate...
It may outweigh her remorse...
If you've misjudged and harmed that girl... what an awful responsibility!
I can't let you behave like that in the parish.
I can't trust you!
We must follow the infallible word and no other!
Did you help her?
That you, Germaine?
It's me, Mother.
Cousin Georges took me to Viel...
on his way to market.
At this time of day?
He had a load of pigs...
so I got a lift part-way.
You had no dinner.
I'll make coffee.
I'm tired, I just want to sleep.
Let me be.
You're a lunatic!
What have you done?
Do something!
What have you done?
I tried to restore her to God...
Are you responsible...?
What's happened?
I tried to restore her to God...
Bringing a dying girl to the altar...
a relic from the past.
Father Donissan will enter the Trappist monastery.
Later we'll find a suitable parish for him.
You baffle me.
I'm used to wisdom from you.
Wisdom is the vice of the old.
Here's the "Imitation of Christ" with your annotations...
You made it yours.
Soon there'll be no way I can help you.
No!
I'll remember you even in Satan's arms.
I didn't teach you blasphemy.
That wasn't blasphemy.
I was shown man's misery and Satan's power for a reason.
You began with too much self-mortification.
You threw yourself into the ministry!
You were pleased with yourself.
You should have found peace.
You haven't.
God never refuses peace.
You're rejecting it.
I suspect you've made some dangerous vow.
I've made no vow... no promise..
barely a wish...
It's poisoning your heart.
You like that picture, no?
Very much.
So many souls possessed by sin...
that enraged me.
To save them, I offered all I had...
My life, first... it's not much...
My salvation, if God wants it.
You risk damnation by straying from the path, as you've done.
The spirit of evil has entered your life.
Fools ignore such things, some priests daren't utter Satan's name!
Inner life today is a battlefield of instincts.
Morality?
Hygiene of the senses.
Temptation is a mere carnal appetite.
People want only what's pleasant and useful...
There's nothing for a saint in such a world... or he's called mad!
Are we truly so wretched?
You're surely not meant for a cloister
Your retreat will be a time of better trial and moral loneliness.
It will last longer than you think.
Hope is almost dead in you!
You'll be alone on your chosen road!
I didn't ask for that!
Let me live and die in humility!
What was begun here will not be finished!
We'll miss you.
You weren't born to please.
The world hates your taste for strength...
Will you ever vanquish the distrust, pity, and opposition... of others?
They'll never let go of you.
Who'll stop me from being what I was?
I attract no attention.
I've the reputation I deserve.
If you let me, I could pass unnoticed...
Unnoticed!
God's work in us is seldom what we expect.
He seems to get things wrong, to waste time.
God wears us down!
How old I feel!
And how... unsuited for it...
I'll never learn to be old!
Poor pastor of Lumbres...
He's good for nothing!
So many nights like last night, until the final night!
I can no longer love.
Does my life have a meaning?
Never any rest...
They've pushed me to the brink...
Beyond it... silence, true silence!
To die...
In the parlor, Father...
It's Mr. Havret, about his sick son.
Which one?
Father, I've come to get you.
Since last night my son's been paralyzed.
The doctor said there's no hope; meningitis!
My wife begged me to come for you We must go, Father.
It's not my parish.
You've a priest at Luzarnes.
I'm touched that Mrs. Havret thought of me... poor woman!
Let's go.
Marthe!
I have to go to Luzarnes.
Not on an empty stomach...
I'll make coffee.
Stay, Father, don't leave us!
Pierre!
I'm ashamed.
Forgive this poor woman's ignorance.
I have great esteem for you.
Pray for me!
Don't tempt me!
Let's go out.
I can't go on...
I'm a poor priest a wretched blind man...
Don't say that...
Your imagination, fatigue...
Why'd I leave her...?
What greater pain than the death of a child?
Nothing's worse.
As I stood before her, I thought...
What?
Nothing...
Only that inner voice...
I knew...
I still know..
I'm sure that a word from me would have... revived... that dead child...
Look at me, answer me frankly...
Who stopped you from testing your power?
I don't know...
Follow me in, I'll find some excuse...
Go to where the body lies...
I'll try...
You think me insane.
Not long ago, I'd have wished for it...
Be careful, Sabroux...
You haven't understood me.
He is there...
He is in our conscience...
He is our conscience!
Men like you!
Satan is prince of this world, he holds it in his hands.
He is here, victorious!
You understand?
We are conquered, I tell you.
And God is conquered with us.
What blasphemy!
Leave me...
Don't listen to me..
Leave you!
Nothing is impossible for a man like you.
I'll follow you.
God inspired you...
Restore the child to its mother.
God is mocking me.
Say who is master, him or You?
Show yourself before abandoning me forever!
O Father, I would have sacrificed even eternal life!
I accept Your sovereign decision.
He's alive!
You are a saint!
One day you'll know, you'll understand...
I hope for your forgiveness...
Forgive me...
My God!
Do not forsake me!
Father Donissan will be glad to see you.
He's out just now.
He's visiting a sick child.
And you know how he is...
Yes, I do...
He arrived here by cart one evening, with his few possessions, a bed frame, some odds and ends, his clothes and books...
It was very foggy...
He had a hard time finding the village.
Next day, he rang the bells, so the village knew it had a priest.
The presbytery was in ruins.
The wind swept through the walls,
Tons of rubble had to be removed.
He worked with the laborers, he fixed it all himself.
He hasn't changed.
I got here later.
to look after him and the house.
Downstairs, that is;
I never go up to his room.
From the start, he said he'd deal with that himself.
I don't even make his bed.
He speaks of you every day.
Father...
Your pain is barren, Satan.
When did I first yield?
You suffered, you prayed with me.
Even that miracle...
Don't mark our time, Lord.
Our attention wavers...
Lord... if I'm still useful,
don't take me from this world.
He's so pale!
In the name of the Father, the son and the holy Ghost.
Amen.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
I confess to Almighty God, to Blessed Mary, ever Virgin, to St. Michael the Archangel, to Blessed John the Baptist, the Holy Apostles...
Peter and Paul, and to all the Saints, and to you, Father, that I have sinned exceedingly in thought, word, deed, and omission...
Hey.
Three dollars.
Thank you.
Best tacos in town.
I get them with the green sauce.
- They're hotter than blue blazes.
- I bet your stomach appreciates that.
Hey, you kidding?
Don't you worry about me.
My stomach's made out of cast iron.
Listen to that guy.
He's nuttier than a fruitcake.
He ought to be put away.
I'm sure he's spent some time in a mental hospital.
And they turn him loose in that condition?
Hey, they don't have any choice.
Against the law to keep him in unless he's a danger to himself or somebody else.
The place he's got left to go is the streets.
I told you, stay away from here!
You're scaring off my business.
Now get lost!
America...
America...
Somebody ought to do something about people like that.
Yeah.
Hurry up and finish.
We got an appointment.
Where?
In a place where they're trying to do something for people like that.
I've never seen so many for-sale signs.
You'd think there was a toxic waste dump in the neighbourhood.
No, that's no toxic waste.
But something that scares people just as much.
Let's go.
- Hi, Miss Ryder?
- Sharon Ryder.
And you must be Jonathan and Mark.
Right, I'm Jonathan Smith, Mark Gordon.
I'm the house manager.
We've been expecting you.
Come on in.
Thank you.
Dr. Gage.
- Oh, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Dr. Gage, these are our house helpers,
Jonathan Smith and Mark Gordon.
Oh, Terry--Terry Gage.
- How are you?
- I'm glad you're here.
The place looks like it could use some work.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, only I'm not the man to do it.
There's a very poor correlation between house plumbing and psychiatry.
Don't worry about it.
We'll take care of the plumbing.
Appreciate it.
Our people will be arriving very shortly and this old fixer-upper still needs a lot of fixing.
How many residents are you gonna have?
Eight.
And we're really very excited about it.
Dr. Gage has been trying to establish a halfway house in this town for years.
What took so long?
Community resistance mostly.
- People just don't want us around.
- It's funny.
Few people would object to living near a hospital or a clinic.
But the thought of living next door to someone with a mental disorder scares most people silly.
They're here.
Looks like we're in business.
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.
Jon, let me ask you something.
Are we gonna be living here with them?
Yeah, we're gonna be living here with them.
Now, let's get fixing the plumbing.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Don't worry about the bags yet.
- Welcome.
Agnes.
Here we go.
Come on.
Yeah.
Hey, this is a nice room, right?
I mean, you got lot of sun, nice view.
What do you think?
Anybody have a preference what bed you get?
We could toss a coin.
I don't care.
Well, that makes it a lot easier.
Listen, why don't you take this one over here?
Let Tom have the one closer to the bathroom.
When you get older, the old kidneys need shorter walks, right, Tom?
Need any help unpacking?
Yeah.
Well, listen, you guys need anything, you just let me know, okay?
Is jogging allowed?
Jogging, sure.
That's a great sport.
Helps shake the cobwebs out of the old noodle.
I've been thinking about taking it up myself.
We'll get together, huh?
Talk to you later.
This is a lovely dress.
Thank you.
I made it myself.
You did?
Really?
I wish I could knit.
I never learned.
Anne, isn't this beautiful?
Peggy made it.
She almost never talks.
Peggy, I understand you're married.
- And you have two children?
- Yes.
How often do you get to see them?
Oh, they come to visit on the weekends and Dr. Gage lets me go home sometimes.
I'll bet you're looking forward to going home permanently.
Someday.
I'm just not ready yet.
I understand.
Oh, my gosh, look at the time.
I've gotta go start dinner.
I've got a lot of people to cook for.
I sure could use some help.
Can you wait until I finish unpacking?
Sure.
Anne, what about you?
Well, maybe you can help another time.
Hey, Mark, do me a favour.
Turn that water on, will you?
Okay, you can shut it off.
- That's all fixed.
- Thanks, Jonathan.
You're a miracle worker.
Yeah, that he is, that he is.
Oh, boy.
Mark, what's wrong?
Oh, I think that's his stomach thanking him for lunch.
I must've got a bad jalapeño.
Well, there's some antacid in the upstairs bathroom.
No, I'll be fine.
Besides, the last time I was up there, Tom had locked himself in.
Boy, you got some weird people in this house.
Well, I mean, all but that Mrs. Ward, Peggy?
I mean, she seems so normal.
What's she in for anyway?
Hey, Mark.
I have reaction depression, Mr. Gordon.
Or you might say a nervous breakdown.
I'm sorry, sometimes I talk without thinking.
It's all right.
Part of the cure is being able to explain your illness.
Is there something I can do?
Well, let's see.
You could start frying the taco shells.
Taco shells?
Excuse me, I think I will try those antacids.
Oh, boy.
Taco shells.
I'll get it.
Oh, boy.
Yeah?
I'd like to speak to someone in charge here.
I guess I'm gonna have to do.
What are you selling?
My name is Raney.
2250, across the street.
I'm president of the homeowner's association.
It's about time some of the neighbours started coming by.
Mark Gordon.
This is not a social call.
I'm here to inform you that your trash barrels are sitting out there by the kerb.
Yeah, well, we just moved in.
We had a lot of trash.
We figured we'd get it out early so we wouldn't miss the pick-up.
The homeowners' covenants and restrictions clearly prohibit refuse receptacles from being in view before 8 p.m.
the night prior to scheduled pick-up.
And that's what you came by to tell me?
I brought you a copy of the code for your enlightenment.
Isn't it customary to bake the new neighbours a plate of brownies or something like that?
We never wanted you people here.
But since you're here, we expect you to abide by the same rules as the rest of us.
Really nice talking to you.
Grouch.
Hey, how you doing, buddy?
How you doing?
Good to see me, huh?
You miss me?
Hey, Pete.
Hey, how you doing, Dad?
- Hey.
- It's good to see you.
Oh, you're looking good, son.
I guess college food agrees with you.
Well, coach has got us on a new weight-training programme.
I'll teach you how it's done, huh?
Hey, I can still take you in the best of five falls, and don't you forget it.
- How long you staying?
- Semester starts in a couple weeks.
Well, come on in.
Your mom's cooking supper.
- We'll surprise her.
- Say, Dad, what's with the for-sale sign?
I wrote you about what was going in next door, didn't I?
- The halfway house.
- Yeah, well, it's happened.
Now everyone's trying to get out while we still have our shirts.
Hey, guys, I heard this joke.
You ready?
Guy buys this parrot, see, and he is told that this parrot speaks 20 languages.
So he takes the parrot home, see?
And, well, the parrot never says a word.
And, well, the guy, he gets kind of mad, you see.
And...
I'm beginning to understand how this guy feels.
At the hospital, they didn't want us talking during meals.
Jay, listen to me.
All of you.
You're not in the hospital anymore.
This is a home.
Your home.
You're much freer here to do as you please.
Yeah, and you see, the dinner table is the best place in the house to just gab and carry on.
That's right.
So let's use this time to discuss house duties.
With a family this size, we have to share the cooking, the cleaning, the laundry.
Hey, I could use some help with the house too.
It needs a lot of work.
Needs some paint, and that front yard's a mess.
Any volunteers?
I always loved flowers.
I could plant some.
You're hired.
You'd trust us to paint the house?
Sure I would.
Painting, repairs.
What about you, Jay?
Can you swing a hammer?
I can try.
- You got a job.
- Right.
It isn't fair.
City council has shoved those people down our throats, and now the property values are dropping out of sight.
Mr. Meyers, it seems to me the reason property values are dropping is because everyone's trying to sell.
Of course they are.
Who wants to live next door to a mental facility?
I'm afraid to go to work and leave your mother here with people running around loose like that.
Mom, are you afraid?
I don't know.
I haven't met any of them.
I just don't know.
Get out of here, you crazy sickos.
Hey, Mr. Meyers, that's your son.
- Hey, you kids.
- Leave them alone, Pete.
- But, Dad--
- It's none of your business.
You don't live here anymore, we do.
If it's going to take something like this for them to get the message, so be it.
Let's get some coffee.
Hello.
Would you like a flower?
Pretty, isn't it?
Mindy.
Come back here.
I told you not to go near strangers.
Now, stay with me.
See you later.
Hi, can I help you?
Are you one of the...?
I mean, do you live here?
Yeah, I'm Jonathan Smith, assistant house manager.
Oh, finally, someone in authority.
Well, what can I do for you?
I wonder if you're aware that any home improvements or landscaping must first be approved by the homeowners' architectural committee.
Improvements?
You mean planting some flowers and painting the house?
A written approval must be granted before commencement of any home-improvement project.
- Failure to comply will result--
- Jonathan.
Well, I got her all chopped up.
We got limbs all over the backyard.
Good job.
- I'll get her all stacked up.
- Good enough.
Doesn't it worry you to be around mental patients like that?
Oh, no, I'm used to it.
Of course, the sad part is, he's not a mental patient.
He's a member of the staff.
Dear Lord.
We'll get this one.
It's cheaper.
But I don't like applesauce.
Well, it doesn't matter what you like.
It's on the list.
Well, I won't eat it.
Look, they're watching us.
Stop that.
You want people to talk?
People talk.
And people point and people laugh.
Get used to it.
- Hey, how you two doing?
- Almost done here.
- Have you seen Peggy?
- She's over where the vegetables are.
I'll see if she needs any help.
Let me help you.
I don't know how I did this.
It happened to me once.
My little girl knocked over a whole display of tuna cans.
I was so embarrassed.
Did you drop this?
Oh, yes.
It must have dropped out of my purse.
- Handsome men.
- Thank you.
I have one son.
Only he's all grown up now and away at college.
He's home for semester break.
That's why I'm buying all this food.
- I bet you're proud of him.
- Very.
How old's your daughter?
She would have been 9 last April.
I'm Sally Lowell.
- Peggy Ward.
- Are you new in the neighbourhood?
I just moved here yesterday.
Oh, you'll like it here.
The people are real friendly.
It's a great place to raise kids.
Well, I'd better get a move on.
I'll see you again, Peggy.
I'm sure I will.
I hope so, Sally.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
Hey, looks like you made yourself a friend, huh?
- You got everything?
- Yes.
We're on our way, then.
Hey, hey, pal, pal, leave me alone, will you?
Hey, hey, hey, now, I said get lost.
Stop!
Hey, pal, are you all right, huh?
That was all my fault.
I was stupid to throw the ball like that.
Looks like I owe you a dog.
- It's all right.
- Hey, wait a minute.
You have to go?
I mean, you saved my dog's life.
I haven't even had a chance to thank you yet.
My name's Pete.
- Well, I'm Anne.
- Thanks, Anne.
I raised this little guy from a pup.
He's a nice dog.
His name is Willie.
Say, I haven't seen you around here before.
Where do you live?
There.
Peter.
I'd like to talk to you for a minute.
Yeah, wait a minute.
Be right there.
I gotta go.
Peter, that girl you were talking to lives in that house.
- So?
- So?
So she's ill, Peter.
For God sakes, don't get involved with somebody like that.
I don't think what she has is catching, Mom.
Besides, I was just thanking her for helping me save Willie's life.
All right, everybody take a bag.
Here you go.
Watch the eggs.
Excuse me.
The mailman left this in our box by mistake.
Thank you.
From your boys?
Yes.
Thank you.
Peggy lost her little girl last year.
She drowned in the family swimming pool.
Peggy blamed herself.
She's fighting back, but she's not quite there yet.
Hold on.
I gotta rest.
I gotta rest.
Come on, Mark, I mean, we're almost home.
Listen, if I don't sit down, you're gonna take me back to that house in an ambulance.
You go on.
Okay.
I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die.
Now watch this.
Oh, wow, it's a flame thrower.
No, dummy, it's a catapult.
We're gonna fry that five-headed dragon.
- You missed.
- I'll just make another one.
- Wait, let me try it.
- No, after me.
It's neat.
Come on, hurry up.
I want a turn.
Whose catapult is this?
Hey, Jerry, look.
Oh, no, let's go, let's go.
Let's get out of here.
Hey, you, what are you doing?
- Did they get the fire out?
- It's out, nobody got hurt.
Good.That's good.
Look, Jay, there's a police officer downstairs.
He wants to talk to you.
What about?
Well, someone saw you run away from the fire and they think you might have started it.
No, it was those boys.
The one across the street and his friend.
They did it.
Then why'd you run away?
I was scared.
The fire got so big so fast.
It scared me.
But I'm safe here.
I just wanted to get home.
I know.
Why don't you come downstairs and tell the officer what happened?
Hey, you don't have to be afraid.
There's nothing to be scared of.
Come on.
I'm telling you, we gotta do something about those people.
That nut could have burned down the whole neighbourhood.
All--
All right, all right, see you then.
Mr. Meyers?
What's he doing here?
He ought to be locked up.
Is this the man you saw running from the fire?
There's no doubt about it.
Mr. Meyers, is Jerry home?
What if he is?
So what?
I'd like to speak with him, please.
Jerry, come down here.
What's this all about?
This man claims that your boy and another kid were in the vacant lot at the same time.
And they could have started the fire.
That's insane.
But what do you expect from a pyromaniac?
Of course he's gonna blame somebody else.
Jerry, were you in the vacant lot this afternoon?
No, I was at Matt's house.
He'll tell you.
Satisfied, officer?
Hey, Jerry, you know, accidents happen.
Could you've started that fire by accident, it just got out of hand?
- No.
- Now, that is all.
I won't have you badgering my boy anymore.
Besides, you've got your firebug.
Put him away.
And while you're at it, close down that cracker factory over there before the whole neighbourhood goes up in smoke.
I believe you, Jay.
We all know it was those two boys.
They're just too afraid to admit it.
Unfortunately, the board is gonna require Jay to undergo psychiatric testing.
Just to satisfy the community.
But I didn't do anything.
Jay, I'm sorry.
But until those tests are arranged, I'm afraid you won't be allowed to leave the property without a house manager with you.
You mean, I have to be guarded?
Like a criminal?
We can't afford to make waves right now.
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
A boy named Pete brought him.
Would you like to go downstairs and thank him?
I'll just be a second.
Who's this dress for, anyhow?
A lady linebacker?
My mother-in-law.
She's very large.
Now, hold still.
I'm just modelling it, okay?
Hey, hey, whatever turns you on.
Cute, cute.
I told you I owed you a dog.
Oh, he's beautiful.
Thank you.
It's my pleasure.
Come on, will you?
How long is this gonna take?
It'll be just a minute.
Here, hold this.
Will you listen to that?
It's 10:00.
The rules prohibit loud music from playing after 10:00.
- I'm putting my foot down.
- Be careful, Harold.
I'll get it.
Yeah?
Oh, it's you, man.
What do you want?
Run, Martha, run.
Raney.
Raney.
Well, I tell you, I know it was those kids.
Ought to wring their necks.
Oh, come on, what good would that do?
It would do me good, I'll tell you that.
I'd like to pinch their little heads off one at a time.
But it wouldn't solve our problem.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Why don't we forget our troubles for a while?
Tomorrow's Founder's Day.
The neighbourhood's gonna have a picnic.
Why don't we join them?
You don't really think we'd be welcome there?
Who cares if we're not?
We live here.
We have a right to be there as much as anybody else.
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on, Sharon.
The only way I know for people to get to know each other is to bring them together.
And what better place to come together than a picnic?
You know, you're right.
Let's do it.
That's great, we'll have hamburgers, potato salad, and softball, three-legged races.
- I love it.
- I gotta make a list.
We're gonna need some things at the store.
You make the list, I'll pick them up.
- Thanks.
- Yeah, stop and get a big jar of olives.
You can't have a picnic without olives.
Wait till you see this.
What are you doing?
This is a moat.
Watch.
Just take the flaming ball and you hit the dragon's head.
Are you crazy?
You're gonna start a fire.
No, I won't.
That's what the moat's for.
If it bounces off, it'll just go into the water.
Ready, aim, fire.
Too short.
We gotta hurry up, though.
The dragon's attacking and he's breathing fire.
Hurry up, get him.
Ready, aim, fire.
- Oh, no.
- Come on, let's get some help.
- Help!
- Help!
- Someone help!
- Fire, there's a fire!
- Help!
- Help, someone!
Fire, fire!
- Fire, fire.
- There's a fire.
Upstairs!
- What's wrong?
- House burning.
- Oh, not again.
- Yeah.
Call the fire department.
- Jerry, Jerry, what's happened?
- It's all right, folks.
There's nothing to worry about.
The fire's out.
What the hell happened?
The boy here was playing with a lighter.
He set some papers on fire and it ignited a plastic bag in the closet.
We found one of these dragons in the lot the other day after the fire.
We don't know how long it had been there or where it came from.
Jerry can tell you.
It's time to tell the truth, son.
You lied to us?
You were in the vacant lot that day?
How did the fire get started, son?
It was an accident.
We didn't mean to, honest.
But you let somebody else take the blame.
That's the worst part.
Do you realise you could have burned this house?
We could have lost everything.
Oh, thank goodness you put the fire out.
Don't thank us, ma'am.
It was your neighbour.
It was Jay, Mrs. Meyers.
You remember him.
He's the pyromaniac that lives across the street.
Potato chips, marshmallows.
Oh, napkins.
I'm gonna get some napkins.
Are you ready?
I don't think I'll go.
Come on, have some fun.
Maybe another time.
Peggy.
I'd like to see you out here a minute, please.
- Is something wrong?
- No.
You've got company.
You didn't think you were gonna go out and have a picnic without us, did you?
Oh, I missed you.
I love you.
Hey, everybody, let's go.
Time for a picnic.
Now, don't worry about being crowded.
I brought the waggon.
- Plenty of room for everyone.
- Great.
What a perfect day for a picnic.
Hey, neighbours.
Hey, we'll see you over at the park.
Can you imagine the nerve?
They're taunting us, is what they're doing.
They know perfectly well they're not welcome.
Of course they do.
Well, it's a big park.
We'll just see they keep their distance.
That's right, we'll just ignore them.
Why should we ignore them?
They're our neighbours.
You've got to be joking.
They're crazy.
- Aren't we all sometimes?
- Sally?
- Mom's right, Dad.
- What?
She's right.
You judged those people without ever knowing them.
They're part of this neighbourhood like us.
They should be at the neighbourhood picnic.
You were the one who was always trying to tell me you couldn't stand people who were prejudiced.
Don't blame me now for listening to you.
What's gotten into you, letting your boy talk to you like that?
He's not a boy.
And it's none of your business, anyway.
Ready?
What's gotten into them?
Those people are the reason that we all have to sell out.
No.
We're the reason.
There's nothing wrong with those people that getting to know them wouldn't cure.
Well, I'll be damned if I'm gonna socialise with them.
In that case, we better not put these things in your waggon.
Come on, let's have a picnic.
As God is my witness, you're going to be sorry.
God is your witness.
But he's the one who's sorry.
For both of you.
Heartfelt greetings to my dear viewers!
Your Bharati Raja joined with supreme hero Chiranjeevi.
We desire to make a lasting impression on your hearts.
We have come before you with this movie Aradhana.
We know that you will support good movies.
This beautiful poem is uttered by the waves of the sea.
This poem is uttered by the foot prints on the sea shore.
We didn't write it down with a pen, but we wrote it with..
..our dear friend, Kanan's camera.
The melodies of the layers of the sea are captured and presented to you..
..in the rendition of lllayraja.
Puliraju!
The rascal who teased our friend's sister is in the market.
Sir!
Puliraju is coming to kill you!
Run away!
Puliraju shouldn't be seen in this village.
All of you sign this.
We are afraid of him.
I will take care of him.
You just sign here.
You, tea stall man!
Sign this.
You also sign this.
You piss in your pants when you hear Puliraju's name.
Are you asking me to sign that?
When he comes back, he will cut your man's right hand too.
What is this?
Get down!
What is this?
Is it a circus company?
Where's the ticket?
It's not a circus company.
Here is the ticket.
It's my family.
Why are you talking rubbish early in the morning?
My name is Daniel.
I used to work in the High Court.
I am retired now.
All these are my children.
My eldest daughter..
Where is your sister?
She is coming.
She took up a job in your village.
We all are living with her earnings.
Is this Gangavaram?
Venkata Rao!
- Present teacher!
Sarojini!
- Present teacher!
Koteshwar Rao!
- Present teacher!
Appa Rao!
- Present teacher!
Subba Rao!
- Present teacher!
Teacher!
You asked our names, but didn't tell us yours.
My name is Jenny!
Now we'll learn a lesson in History.
What are the great works that Ashoka did?
You tell me.
Emperor Ashoka planted trees besides the roads.
Good!
Sit down!
Name your favorite leader.
You!
- Tanguturi Prakasham!
- Good!
Sit down!
You!
- Subash Chandra Bose!
- Good!
Sit down!
You!
- Our village's leader Gangavaram Puliraju!
He is not an ordinary man.
He is a well-known ruffian.
Even the birds and buffaloes in the village are afraid of him.
He is a great man who was put in prison 18 times.
Kotesha!
Did you sign on that paper?
I have kids.
Why will I sign that paper?
Ey Kadar!
Did you sign the paper?
No, I did not sign any paper.
Did you forget Puliraju's fist so soon?
If I hit you with it, you'll vomit the milk you drank in infancy.
Who is this Puliraju?
He is a criminal who constantly gets into fights.
Half of the time he is in prison.
Otherwise he is fully drunk.
He is Mangamma's son.
She works in our school.
All sorts of misfortunes befall us if we take that ruffians name.
I don't know what to do with him.
He never listens to me.
It is afternoon now.
Are you still sleeping?
Don't trouble me.
You be on your way.
Are you not coming with me?
- Where are we going?
I won't tell you that.
Are you coming or not?
I won't come.
- You get up!
What is the fight for?
What does he owe us?
He owes us a lot.
Lots of gold and other utensils too.
Why didn't you collect all those when father died?
Village head said that he'll settle it when the time comes.
Your uncle asked me to bring you once.
How dare your brother orders me to come to him?
I don't care what the village head says.
I'll just settle the matter immediately.
We have entered the village.
Wash your face and behave in a dignified manner.
Why should I be dignified when we are going to fight?
Are we going to see a girl or what?
Yes.
Your uncle's daughter Gangamma has grown up.
We'll talk to him and fix your marriage.
No way!
If you don't listen to me, I'll hang myself here.
Puliraju!
Sit straight!
Why are you feeling shy like a bride ready to get married?
Come here and see what your husband needs.
Any girl will feel shy when it comes to her marriage.
Leave her alone.
See your son.
He is feeling so shy.
Others would think that he is the bride.
Why should I feel shy?
I'm not scared of anyone.
- What did she just say!
Your aunt's son is coming along with her to see you.
Don't talk too much before him.
What did you cook for him?
I made lentil soup and fried some dry fish.
I made chicken curry and fish curry too.
I put lots of garlic and onions since its good for his health.
If you want something else just tell me.
Coals are still hot, I'll make it in a minute.
Brother, you go to the priest and fix a date for the marriage.
You plan to tie him down, is it?
Is he so difficult to control?
What are you saying uncle?
I am not in a hurry to marry.
Mother is worrying too much.
In the morning if I drink a full..
I am talking about coffee and tea.
I like to live a care-free life.
I don't want your girl.
Where are you going?
It's not good to smoke before uncle.
I'll be back in a minute.
My dear aunt's son!
Why are you going off so soon?
You came to my house like a bridegroom.
I cooked fish curry, chicken curry and prawns fry for you.
Why didn't you say good-bye to me?
My husband!
Husband?
Did I marry you?
You need not marry me.
I've decided that you are my husband.
Why do you look so confused?
I heard that you refused to marry me.
That's when I started to doubt you my dear aunt's son!
If you refuse me for another woman, I'll kill that woman.
O God!
She's worse than me.
You may be the hero of Gangavaram.
But I am the star of this Ramannapalem.
Are you not ashamed to say no to marriage at this age?
I am a very dangerous woman.
You can be good and marry me now.
Or I'll come to your village and marry you.
Don't under estimate this Gangamma.
You don't know me.
You have never tasted my fist yet.
If you come beyond that tree, I'll break your bones.
"l got ready for you."
"I'll come with you."
"Why do you look at me like that? "
"Please don't be so arrogant."
"l will not leave you if you behave rudely with me."
"l will be happy if you just marry me."
"Don't be afraid of me because I am naughty."
"Don't break my heart after you stole it."
"l was born for you."
"l saved myself for you."
"C'mon dance with me."
"lf you refuse me, I'll promise you one thing."
"I'll do whatever it takes to make you my own."
"l won't leave you so easily."
"You'll never forget my fish curry."
"You'll not move if I am on bed."
"l decorated myself for you."
"l am not some garbage to refuse me."
"I'll manage your household very well."
"l swore to myself that I won't leave you so easily."
"l got ready for you."
"I'll come with you."
"Why are you looking at me like that? "
"Please don't be so arrogant."
"Why are you looking at me like that? "
"Please don't be so arrogant."
"l won't leave you even if you behave with me rudely."
"l will be happy if you just marry me."
"l got ready for you."
"l will come with you."
"Why are you looking at me like that? "
They look like my things.
Correct!
This is my chair!
This is my mat!
Who threw my things here?
My cigarette packets and bottles are very valuable.
Who threw them here?
Become steady!
Somebody changed my devil's den into a temple.
It must be the work of some new devil.
I am angry now.
Gangavaram shivers at the sound of my name.
You devil!
You come out!
You will shiver when you see me!
You should salute to me!
Why did you throw my things in the garbage?
How dare you!
Come out you devil!
Puliraju!
Please get up!
Why are you pleading him?
Is this not your house?
It is my house.
I'll persuade him.
You please go inside.
You should hand over such drunkards to the police.
Police?
Don't mess with me!
I can kill three people with just a two inch knife.
Shut up!
What nonsense are you talking?
You have no business in this house.
Ask him to get out of here.
Why do you speak in English?
Don't I know English?
Puliraju!
Please sit down!
Listen to me!
Please..
It's nothing.
I'll settle the matter.
Puliraju!
The king presented this building to my grandfather.
My grandfather gave it to my father.
My father passed it on to me.
All these years you called it a devil's den, so nobody came here.
At last some one from the neighboring village came here.
So please listen to me and..
Call that man out!
Mr. Daniel!
- I am right here!
Did you like the house?
- Yes, we like it very much.
Even though I was born in my house, I grew up in this house.
I am very attached to this house.
If you want, sometimes you can come here to sleep.
Never mind.
You can keep the house.
He is such a good man.
Since all of you are begging me, I will leave the house.
I'll try for another place in the village.
If I don't get any good place, I'll come back to this house.
Are you the new teacher?
When I saw you, I thought it must be you.
Give me those bags.
They are very light.
We help any new girl that comes to our village.
He will wash your dirty clothes, and I will iron them.
No!
He will wash the clothes and I will iron them.
Keep quite!
You will wash them, and I will iron them.
Boss!
Did you see donkeys eating sweets?
See those donkeys walking with the sweet teacher!
Gopal!
Come here!
We are finished!
Hello sir!
Why are you carrying loads that are beyond your capacity?
Is it some kind of public service?
The teacher had too many bags.
We are just helping her.
Are you helping her or helping yourself?
You don't even know to talk.
And your father built a school.
Do you like sweets or do you like the sweet teacher?
Teacher is like a sister to me.
Oh no!
You broke my heart!
She is his sister!
So what did you bring for this brother-in-law?
Nothing..
- Let me see.
Are you not ashamed to carry this one rupee note?
And he is the son of the correspondent!
O God!
Teacher!
- What is it?
Puliraju hit his mother!
She has fainted in the school.
Don't you understand?
How many times should I tell you?
Fine.
Write it down.
Teacher!
You both go inside and study!
Teacher!
I heard that my mother is in your house.
I am talking to you.
Please call my mother.
I just raised my hand when I was drunk, she got hurt.
Why are you making it a big issue?
Is my mother alive or dead?
Will you tell me at least that?
Are you not ashamed to ask if your mother is dead or alive?
How will an illiterate like you know the value of a mother?
Your mother should have died when she gave birth to you.
But she is still alive to see your sins.
Puliraju!
You are half man and half beast.
It's in your name.
Get out!
It's night now!
He must have got drunk and gone home.
He doesn't eat food until I beg him 10 times.
He must be starving now!
It will teach him a lesson!
You don't worry that your son will be without food.
I sent him food with my younger brother.
Why did you send him food?
God punished him for beating his mother.
He would have learnt a lesson if he starved without food.
I don't understand why God is still keeping me alive.
Don't say that.
I understood your son in just one minute.
I taught many children in my life.
Some look very innocent and good, but are bad at heart.
Some look very rude, but are very good at heart.
Your son is very rude, he hit many people.
But when I slapped him, why didn't he retaliate?
It shows that goodness and humanity haven't left him.
Why are you looking at me as if you are seeing an animal?
I am your son.
Why did you give birth to such a bad man?
And why did you name me Puliraju?
I hit you when I was madly angry.
I did a mistake.
But it doesn't mean that you should leave me.
It hurts me.
'l and Jenny are meeting tonight.
- Puliraju.'
'Puliraju is marrying Jenny.' 'Jenny come to the beach at 7:00.'
Teacher!
Why are you going back so soon?
Did you forget something?
Or is the school closed today?
Stop!
You are so wicked that even your touch can kill plants.
God will never forgive you for your sins.
Whole village is gossiping about you.
Why did you write that rubbish on the walls?
Mother!
What are you talking?
What did I write on the walls?
Didn't you write rubbish about the teacher on the school walls?
Mother!
When did I go to school and learn to write?
Did I go to school and get good education?
Even after studying am I not willing to take up a job?
You can ask any police man in this district.
All will tell you that Puliraju is an illiterate, a finger print man.
Will I write something about the teacher..
How could you believe that?
Teacher!
I want to talk to you.
Mother told me what happened.
I don't know if you will believe me or not, I am innocent.
If you tell me to fight with someone, I will do it.
If you tell me to admit my fault and ask forgiveness, I'll do it.
Except for these two things, I don't know anything else.
I can't come inside and ask God to forgive my past sins.
Can you pray to God in my behalf and ask him to forgive me?
Teacher!
I know that you didn't pray to God on behalf of me.
You don't believe me, do you?
I never went to school.
I didn't learn to write.
Letters look like hanging bats to me.
If you want, you can ask anyone in this village.
Everybody calls me an illiterate finger print man.
Now I know that you prayed for me.
That's more than enough for me.
Ey!
Come here!
It won't be nice if I beat you.
Ey!
You hit him!
Does it hurt?
You hit him one!
I don't like this at all.
Do one thing.
All of you hit each other.
This is Puliraju's order!
Yes!
You continue!
I'll come back in the evening.
You continue doing the same.
If you stop in between, I won't spare your lives.
Once upon a time there was a forest.
All the animals in the forest lived peacefully.
Parrots, rabbits, peacocks, deers, tortoises and elephants.
One day a tiger came to the forest.
Arrival of the tiger created confusion among the animals.
All the animals were afraid that they will loose their lives.
It's coming.
- What is it?
- Urine!
- Go!
After that even the sparrows and other birds..
Teacher!
- What is it?
- Toilet!
- Go!
Ran away!
When the tiger saw that the animals fled in fear, it became proud.
Teacher!
- Don't disturb me till I complete the story!
You go wherever you want!
But teacher!
- Who is that?
Didn't you hear what I said?
Stand up on the bench!
C'mon!
All the time you keep visiting the bathroom.
You'll say that correctly.
That tiger..
Puliraju!
What is this?
I want to learn to write.
I got up early in the morning.
I did exercise, took bath and ate food too.
I went into the village and bought all the books.
I want to study.
Did you realie now that you need to study?
When some one else wrote rubbish on the walls..
..all of you blamed me because I am illiterate.
So I decided to study and teach a lesson to such..
Puliraju!
- It's not like that teacher.
I just want..
See how the other children are running away from you.
There is a time for everything.
You need to study as a child.
You have grown up to be a drunkard.
Teacher, I want to..
- Didn't you hear what I said?
Go out!
Why are you standing out?
Come inside!
Why are you afraid of him?
Come inside!
Silence!
You stand up!
What is this?
Is this hair or a bird's nest?
Is this the way to come to school?
Get it cut!
I should see your hair nicely combed tomorrow.
Will you do it?
- Yes teacher!
- Good!
Even a tiger has to bow down his head before me!
Stand up!
What is this?
I asked you to cut your hair.
What is this style?
See yourself in the mirror.
You look terrible.
Who cut your hair like this?
Puliraju!
Why did you come again?
Should I shave your head?
I asked you to cut my hair like a student.
What did you do?
Don't beat me!
I beg you to leave me!
Puliraju is beating up the barber!
Teacher!
I cut my hair.
Teacher!
Are you still angry with me?
Please teach me to read and write.
I want to study.
Love your country!
Abound in good works!
A country is not just land, it is people!
A country is not just people..
A country is not just land..
Why are you laughing?
Teacher!
I am not joking.
I really want to study.
Please teach me.
I will sincerely learn.
I will stand here on one leg till you give me an answer.
Teacher!
You are going off, is it?
Remember this!
I won't even drink water till you give me an answer.
I will stand here.
Teacher!
I will stand here on one leg till you answer me.
I won't even drink water till you give me an answer.
I don't care if you don't drink water or jump into fire.
Silence!
"Who can defeat Puliraju? "
"He is determined to compete with the sun."
"Please stop being stubborn."
Where are you hurrying?
Don't you know?
Puliraju is standing on one leg since this morning.
Whole village has gone to see him.
Come, let's go.
"Your stubbornness has won.
You have won."
"Congratulations Puliraju!
You have passed in the test."
"Young man's pride has come down."
"Rebellious beast is ready to be tamed."
"Puliraju has stopped drinking liquor."
"It's good to see him learning manners."
"His devilish mind has come to senses."
"He has books in his hand."
"Lessons of his life can't be taught in any school."

Puliraju!
I gave you 20 rupees and told you to bring 3 things.
If one thing costs 6 rupees, how much money will be left?
Nothing will be left.
Think carefully and tell me.
A glass of liquor is 6 rupees.
3 glasses are 18 rupees.
1 rupee is for the soda and 1 rupee is for fried dumplings.
Nothing will be left.
Hello boss!
Our Puliraju has turned into a gentleman!
Did you join an office?
You have changed completely.
Puliraju is not the same.
He has become stylish.
What is this boss?
You have changed so much.
Nobody fears you in Gangavaram.
All things, therefore, that you want men to do to you..
..you also must likewise do to them.
This, in fact, is what the Law and the Prophets mean.
Hello sir!
Hello!
May the Lord save you and me.
Puliraju!
Will you teach my father to jump like a cat?
No!
He teaches stick fighting in a better way.
Please show us Puliraju!
Shut up!
I have noticed that Puliraju has changed a lot.
He has changed his manners, appearance and language.
Jenny!
Bring some coffee for Puliraju!
Puliraju!
What are you seeing?
Nothing!
Teacher!
Is Jesus illiterate like me?
What?
- Poor man!
He is looking after the sheep.
He is a good shepherd.
What?
- He loves and takes care of everyone.
Teacher!
Why is holding the little lamb so close to him?
He is a merciful man who brought back the strayed lamb.
What will you do if you find that lamb?
I would have killed it for a delicious meal.
What if it was Jennifer?
- Teacher!
- What if it was me?
"What happened? "
"What happened?
A heart flew away with wings."
"What happened?
It came here searching for its mate."
"It's a dream which is not a dream.
It came true."

"What happened?

"What happened? "
"Heavens came down to be friends with the Land."
"Land was overjoyed and invited Heavens with flowers."
"I've never seen flowers.
I never worshipped God."
"l can't stay on the Land, I can't look at the Heavens."
"You looked straight into the eyes of a young girl."
"You have pierced her heart which you cannot see."
"A rain drop turned the barren drop into a field."
"lt produced songs from a mute throat."

"He will become a human."

Raju!
Come here!
I can't throw anything without looking at it.
Who is he?
He hit me without even looking at me.
He is Lawrence, our relative.
Lawrence, this is Puliraju about whom I told you.
Thank you!
Raju!
His father is a very rich man.
He is the only heir.
He is planning to take up a contract very soon.
Sister!
Let me tell.
He studied in America.
He worked in Paris.
He brought many gifts for all of us.
Big train, biscuits, chocolates, ball and many other things.
Not only that..
- That's enough.
We'll go and have tea.
Come Raju!
When will this fellow go from here?
- I don't know.
Puliraju!
You should me this place.
What else is there to see in this village?
We have only this sea in our village.
Didn't you like it?
It's not that.
What a beautiful ocean with hills surrounding!
Rocks!
Waves!
I really love it!
What did you say?
- I said I love this ocean, hills and waves.
I played in the ocean since my childhood.
I won't tolerate it if you say something bad about it.
It's nothing like that Puliraju!
He said he loves it.
I am afraid of that he will love.
He is trying to take the girl away.
Puliraju!
Can't you speak that silly English?
Start off!
What is this?
Brinjal curry!
What do you know?
Lime juice!
This sea, these rocks, these shells, this fungus..
..this sky, this teacher, yes, A, B, C, B, A..
Do you have a sea like this in your village?
Of course!
- It can't be.
We have it only in our village.
Do you know how deep it is?
It is very very very very deep.
If you want you can get into the water and check.
Do you know why the sea water is salty?
- No!
Don't you know that?
God urinated from the heavens.
Careful!
This is called Pandavs Cave.
If you shout from here, you'll hear your voice again.
Shout!
You call out somebody's name.
Jennifer!
Puliraju!
You show me some more good places.
There are no more good places.
What happened to you?
My stomach is burning.
Wow!
Look at that!
They look so good together.
The teacher and the sir in suit make a great pair.
Educated people are educated people after all.
Even our Puliraju must be having something in heart.
He reached to pants from loincloth.
The man in suit slowly pushed our Puliraju aside.
Puliraju!
What happened?
Why are you sitting here?
Where did that lamb come from?
It's a strayed lamb teacher.
It's an orphan like me.
What did you say?
- Teacher!
Will you look after this lamb?
Poor thing!
It doesn't know English just like me.
Raju!
Can you look at me and say what you just said?
I can't speak if I look at you.
Look at me.
- No.
- Raju!
Raju!
Catch that lamb!
"Jasmines flowered on the creeper."
"Shall I pluck those and make a garland for worship? "
"Why do you hesitate even after your heart opened up? "
"Why are you speechless even after love is showered? "
"Jasmines flowered on the creeper."
"Shall I pluck those and make a garland for worship? "
"Did I see it happening?
Did it happen before I realized it? "
"Did it happen long back?
Did I realize it just now? "
"l desire her.
But am I worthy of her? "

"Why do you hesitate even after your heart opened up? "
"Why are you speechless even after love is showered? "
"Jasmines flowered on the creeper."
"Shall I pluck those and make a garland for worship? "
When did our country get its independence?
What is our country's capital?
Puliraju!
Did you forget?
Nothing teacher!
You are teaching me so many things.
But I am forgetting everything.
Sometimes when I try to imagine your face, I forget that too.
When I try to think why I can't remember my teacher's face..
..I don't get sleep at night and become restless.
You didn't give your teacher any fees.
So you are forgetting everything.
Yes.
I'll bring it in a second.
Teacher!
You didn't tell me what you want.
It should not be money, and something that you get in the market.
Not money, not something that we get in the market.
Teacher!
I'll find it wherever it is, and bring it for you.
What I want is with you.
Where will you search for it?
Teacher!
You said that your fees should not be money.
And that it should not be something we get in market.
So I brought you something.
Can you guess what it is?
It is definitely not what I thought.
What is that teacher?
First, you show me what you brought.
Then I'll tell you what I thought.
Is it not a normal shell?
It's not a normal shell.
It is the one in Lord Shiva's hand.
We get normal shells everywhere.
It's very difficult to get one of these.
I searched in the sea for three days and three nights.
Finally I found it hidden Very deep in the sea.
Why are you so breathless?
Forget my breathlessness.
Hear this shell's sound.
Hello!
Why are you carrying so many loads?
I didn't find a donkey to carry them for me.
Didn't you find a donkey?
- You are there, aren't you?
Wow!
You laugh just like a donkey.
Take this.
Why did you call me a donkey?
My father and grandmother Also call me the same.
Ey!
Is she your girl?
Is he a donkey too?
- He's my friend.
I see.
So he's a second donkey.
Stop laughing and call him.
Whenever a girl comes to our village, we help her.
It's a co-operative system.
Is it a third one?
We three eat in the same plate and sleep in the same bed.
We rarely get such kind of girls.
Some girls look very beautiful from the front.
Some look strikingly beautiful from the side.
Some look terrific from behind too.
Do you know how happy we are to carry your load?
Are you educated?
- Yes.
This is village material.
- Village material?
Is it good?
Do you want to see?
- Yes.
My father and grandmother are dead.
- Is that so?
Aunty!
I can't repeat the same thing again and again.
Listen carefully!
I'll stay here from now.
I'll take care of the house.
I'll make the rules.
I'll love my husband very much and make you sit in a corner.
Will you take away my son from me?
He may be your son, but he should listen to his wife.
Fuel the fire.
If I don't control him, I'll have to cry my whole life.
My son is not a buffalo to dance to your tunes.
Am I a cow?
I can handle wilder creatures than your son.
If I don't turn your son into a sheep, I'll change my name.
Just wait and watch.
- There he is.
Show him what you want.
What is this?
You look like a little boy going to school.
Did you see that?
He came to see me.
After that a tiger turned into a cat.
He became a gentleman.
If I can change him so much with my looks..
..how much more will I change him after marrying him.
Ramannapalem Gangamma!
Will you do me a favor?
What is it?
- Shut your mouth!
I didn't come here to shut my mouth.
Listen to me..
Did you see how much gold I brought with me?
Nose ring, chain, necklace, ear rings, anklets, bangles and..
..I don't what you call this.
My father got it for me.
You should have gone with your father.
It would be nice.
What did I say?
- You will say many things now.
Father!
- Keep quite!
What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.
She is missing her father.
He was fine when he came to see me.
But now he's changed
He is the son-in-law, but he didn't attend father's funeral.
My father constantly asked about him on his deathbed.
Puliraju!
- Yes.
- I want to talk to you in private.
Come with me.
What?
You want to talk to me in private.
It means that I have become someone great.
Come.
You said you want to talk something.
Go ahead.
Raju, I am..
- Why do you hesitate?
Tell me.
Should I bring a monkey from the mountain?
Or should I bring the whole mountain like Hanuman?
I am planning to go to my village.
What did you say?
Please say it again.
I am going to my village.
- Wow!
It's a good decision.
Your village is like your mother.
A man should live in his own village as long as he lives.
Will you go tomorrow or day after tomorrow?
Go tomorrow.
Because day after tomorrow is new moon.
Should I arrange a vehicle or will you go in the bus?
I don't want to go alone.
I want to take someone with me.
I gave you company as long as you stayed here.
But if you want me to be with you forever, it's not possible.
I don't want to take you.
I want to marry and take the girl with me.
Get married immediately.
Go tomorrow and get married.
Even a new moon is a good time.
A bachelor will remain a bachelor if he takes too long.
You don't take too long.
I'll take care of the arrangements.
I'll arrange for the music and make the whole village dance.
Who are the girl's parents?
I'll talk to them.
We should not lessen the dowry at all.
Now tell me who the girl is?
- What do you think of Jennifer?
Jenny!
If you go to a temple And find the doors closed..
..go straight to the school and see the teacher's face.
What will Jennifer's family Say about my marriage?
All will jump with joy.
Her father will be overjoyed.
He will personally take care of the marriage arrangements.
Who is that girl?
- Jennifer!
Are you fine or are you drunk?
Are you in your senses?
How could you think of such a thing?
I gave birth to you but didn't teach you anything.
I just gave you food.
But that goddess taught you to write.
You learned to write but didn't leave your foolishness.
You go and apologize to her for thinking of her like this.
You worship her foot prints for your sins to be forgiven.
This Gangi has rested all her hopes on you.
Marry her and live happily.
You should understand the situation.
After your mother's death, we all were left alone.
But you looked after this family as a mother at a very young age.
Fortune is at your door step, please don't refuse it.
I am not telling you all of this for myself.
I may die at any moment.
But think about your siblings.
Handicapped sister, her treatment, and her marriage.
Education of two brothers.
Think of your responsibilities and take a decision.
Father!
As you said I took care of this family after mother's death.
Don't you think I am capable of taking a good decision now?
Please don't trouble me again and again.
Teacher!
Who lives on the Tirupati mountain?
- God!
Who lives on this mountain?
- Here?
You and me.
No!
- Who else?
Raju!
Wait!
Raju!
Teacher!
Now you are alone on this mountain.
You are a Goddess.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Did you forget me?
I am Puliraju's cousin.
Don't scold me in English as did the other day in school.
My cousin went to make the marriage chain.
He said that he is busy with the marriage arrangements.
And so he won't be able to meet you for three days.
I came here to give you this message.
I came walking in the hot son.
I am feeling thirsty.
Will you give me some water?
Teacher!
Did you hear anything like this?
My cousin did not earn a single rupee till now.
But since he is getting married, he is demanding many things.
He said that he won't put the marriage chain in my neck..
..until you touch it with your hands and bless it.
He said that he won't marry me if you don't sit before him.
You taught him to read and write, didn't you?
He keeps talking about you all the time.
He said that you should select the marriage saree too.
If we sow wheat, we will have to reap the harvest.
After sowing the seed, can we escape from harvesting it?
Similarly, since my marriage is fixed, can I escape from it?
I just spoke my heart out.
I only speak the truth.
I love my cousin.
So can l escape from marrying him?
Give me the water.
I am very thirsty.
Live happily for a 100 years.
I'll see you later.
He said that he won't put the marriage chain in my neck..
..until you touch it with your hands and bless it.
He said that he won't marry me if you don't sit before him.
Why are you laughing?
If we subtract 275 from 330, we get 55.
Why did you put 30?
- You are wrong, teacher!
Good evening teacher!
I am sorry.
What's the time?
It doesn't matter.
One boy told me that you did a wrong sum.
So I thought of meeting you.
What he said is true.
Your sum is wrong!
If you don't concentrate, you will go wrong.
I got my chance now.
Goddess of education went home when the bell rang.
She will come back tomorrow morning.
Will you please get out?
- Don't shout!
Maintain silence!
You are not the teacher now.
I'll teach you, you should learn.
Are you ready?
- Get out!
- Shall we start the lesson?
Don't be stubborn.
C'mon my dear teacher.
You rascal!
Leave me!
Leave me!
How could a teacher behave so indecently?
Come out!
Puliraju!
I think it will be good to close the school.
We'll take in 4 to 5 girls.
We can do good business.
The teacher can help us to count our profits.
Shameless people!
Don't you have any other place for this?
He is a drunkard.
Now he has got a girl too.
Before my spit on your face dries up, you all go from here.
Otherwise you'll see the old Puliraju again.
Go from here!
Puliraju!
I met you just a few days ago
But I've formed an attachment with you.
I feel sad to leave you and go.
If you don't like it here, come to my village immediately.
You can work in my company.
I am taking just one thing from your village.
Do you know what it is?
I am taking your heart.
You do one thing.
I'll give you my card.
Uncle!
Please give the tickets.
TC wants to check them.
Excuse me!
Teacher!
They fire crackers at the festival of the goddess.
If you see them lying on the sea shore, they look beautiful.
But we can never catch them.
Teacher!
You taught me to read and write.
Once I said that when I see you, I forget everything else.
But today I am not able to forget anything.
Raju!
We came to your village and made friends with you..
Tickets!
Ey!
Did you bring the sheep with you?
- No!
Sir, did you see it?
- I didn't see it.
- Didn't you see?
What is that?
- It's a box. - Is It the Harmonium box?
- Yes.
If it's a Harmonium box why is it making that strange sound?
Show it to me!
It's a sheep!
You should come to our village every now and then.
You should come and stay in our house.
Inform us before you come, we all will be ready for you.
Puliraju!
Jenny has to take care of me and my family.
She is very fortunate.
Lawrence wants to marry her.
Later we will be able to marry off the handicapped girl too.
My sons will have a good future too.
Everything is in your hands.
You don't come to our house.
Never come to our house.
Please don't come.
Puliraju!
I'll go now.
You don't come to our house.
Never.
"Stop.
Please stop.
Time, please stop."
"Stop.
Please stop.
Time, please stop."
"Stop this distress.
Don't move away.
Don't leave me."
"Stop.
Please stop.
Time, please stop."
"You imprinted my beloved's face in my heart."
"You have lighted the lamp of love."
"You melted like a dream and remained like smoke."
"Does light mean burning wood? "
"Does life mean only memories? "
"ls there no other way? "
"Stop.
Please stop.
Time, please stop."
What is this?
Can't you work fast?
Get it down!
That side!
Who are you?
Why are you destroying my temple?
Please stop it.
Please stop it.
It's not a temple.
Veerraju bought this house from me.
He is building a store house here.
You are drunk.
Go home and sleep.
I won't tolerate if you break another brick.
If you want, ask someone to buy it and live in it.
But if you break it down, I'll break your bones.
Someone bought this house and is building something else.
What is it to you?
Go from here!
You are breaking my goddess's temple.
You tell that man to build his store house somewhere else.
But don't..
I am telling you..
I will get angry.
You are not former Puliraju.
We are not afraid of you now.
You have lost your power and authority.
What did you say?
See what I'll do.
Cousin!
Who dared to hit my cousin?
When a giant palm tree falls down..
..even little pigs of the gutter will play on it.
If my cousin was the former Puliraju..
..your wives would have become widows by now.
But my cousin doesn't get angry now.
He doesn't have the will to kill someone.
He has buried his feelings in his heart.
That man bought this house from me.
I can't stop him if he wants to destroy it and build something else.
Take him home.
- Let's go.
Start the work.
Let's go.
- Ganga!
They are..
breaking.. breaking my temple.
They bought it with money.
They can do anything with it.
Let's go.
- It's not that Ganga!
It's my goddess's temple.
Uncle!
I studied in this school!
- Is that so?
Aunt used to drop me here everyday.
I have never seen my parents.
Aunt is everything for me.
She brought me up, got me educated in another country.
But she lives a very lonely life.
Chess is her only time-pass.
Jenny!
You are aiming at my king, aren't you?
You will not be successful, you will have many obstacles.
Check mate!
You can't move this way or that way!
Now you have to take a decision.
I wanted to ask you something since a long time.
Do you like Meera very much?
I admire her very much.
She reminds me of my own past.
I am living the same life as Meera did.
When you are in love, you can't see anything else.
It's a beautiful experience.
It's a long season of spring.
It's not possible for this little child to ring that heavy bell.
His little hands have nothing to do with that heavy bell.
So my dear brothers, someone rang the bell by mistake.
You all can continue with your works.
Teacher!
Teacher!
Raju!
What are you doing here?
Did you ring the church bell?
You told me that when we ring the bell at an odd hour..
..everyone will come to the church to see what happened.
So I rang the bell.
I felt like seeing you.
Jenny!
Spring went out of my life with the same speed as it came.
I loved someone.
But I married someone else.
First night, I told my husband everything without hesitating.
To my great surprise, he was very broad minded.
Wholeheartedly he sent me to the man that I loved.
But when I went back, the man that I loved wasn't there.
He lost his life in the war.
I am spending my life with the memories of my beloved.
These are the rhythms in my life.
Cousin!
Aunt is very serious.
She many die any moment.
I am calling you for two days now, but you never come.
She wants to see you before she dies.
Please come and see her just once.
Cousin!
- Gangamma!
You go home.
I'll come later.
Cousin!
You won't come.
I know the reason too.
I know what's in your heart.
You are afraid that aunt will ask you to marry me.
When I came to know that you don't love me,
..I changed.
I beg you, I promise you, I will never marry you.
I'll stay in your house and serve you.
Don't say no.
I would spend my whole life with you if I didn't meet Jenny.
Please forgive me.
Aunty!
Your son has come!
Mother!
Did you come?
I am not sad that I am dying.
I am worried about..
Gangamma.
Aunty!
You said it's an exclusive parcel.
Is this the one?
Yes.
There's a bomb inside.
It will explode when you open it.
Open it aunty!
- Yes, please see if it explodes or fails.
Did you show it to Jenny?
No!
I wanted to give her a surprise.
You show it to her.
Oh yes!
It's very good.
I'll show it to Jenny.
Uncle!
No one should see the cards till I tell you.
Jenny!
Your game is up.
Your next move is in this invitation.
Aunty!
- Yes!
You saw them.
Give me the cards back.
Uncle!
I told you not to see them.
Jennifer!
Gangamma!
Looks like your cousin started working!
It's good that he no longer goes around like a lazy man.
Finally, he has come to his senses.
You don't have to go around the village to sell them.
I am ready to buy all of them from you.
I'll give you around 200 rupees.
Keep the fishes there.
Don't take out even a single fish.
It's not your property.
We did the hard work.
It's ours.
I already sold these fishes to him for 200 rupees.
Is that so?
Who will pay me back the debts?
Lawrence, what is this?
Why is there a mistake in the invitation?
Mistake?
What are you saying?
I got it printed in the city's biggest press.
It's impossible.
Why did you change the bride's name?
Before printing the cards, did you ask Jenny's opinion?
I asked him to print the cards.
What's wrong in that?
Did we push her into a well or a ditch?
She will be sad until you push her into a well or a ditch.
It might be from 16 to 18.
- I wish I get my hands on it.
Give me 50 rupees. - 50 is too much.
You take 25 rupees.
No way!
Your father is coming!
Appa Rao!
What were you talking to my son?
He asked me the difference between small and big fish.
I said that the small one is tasty and the big one has fat.
I need not tell you about fishes.
It's an expensive fish.
It will cost you atleast 200 rupees.
Who will give 200 rupees for such cheap fish?
It's not a normal fish.
It's shark fish.
It slips away.
To give more than hundred, she should know to read and write.
I gave that Jennifer teacher just 100 rupees.
She accepted it happily and came to me.
What did you say?
Whom did you give 100 rupees?
Don't you know?
I gave 100 rupees to Jennifer atleast 6 times.
If she didn't go with Lawrence, I would have given her more.
What beauty!
Striking beauty!
You good for nothing fellow!
What did you say?
I will..
Shut your mouth!
- Why should I shut my mouth you rascal?
Don't talk too much, or else you know what I can do.
You kept quite as long as we spoke about you.
Why are you getting angry if we talk about that Jennifer?
Is it because your cousin kept her with him for 3 months?
What did you say?
- Cousin!
They didn't say anything.
We didn't say anything about Gangamma.
We are talking about Jennifer.
What did you say?
I am talking about that Jennifer who eloped with Lawrence.
Cousin!
They did not talk anything about Jennifer.
They were talking about me.
If I tell you the truth, you will not leave them.
It's not good.
Gangamma!
You don't understand me at all.
Is it less offensive if they talk bad about you?
Now tell me!
Tell me!
I spoke about both of them.
What will you do?
You were a tiger once upon a time, but now you are a cat.
Cousin!
He is beating up our men.
Go and help them.
Cousin!
Don't leave them!
Break their bones!
Why are you wet?
Didn't you come in the car?
Car broke down.
I was help up in the heavy rain.
I'll take them.
- Give them to me.
I'll get them.
Sorry, I am troubling you at an odd time.
Cousin!
Gangamma!
What did they say?
How long will I live?
Nothing will happen to you.
You will live for a 100 years.
I know everything.
My throat is damaged.
My stomach is damaged.
My blood is clotting.
But my ears are still working Gangamma.
I heard every word of the doctor.
Gangamma!
I can even hear the pain of your heart.
Will I not hear the doctor's words?
Gangamma!
Will you do me
..a favor before I die?
Just tell me.
I'll do anything for you as long as I am alive.
No Gangamma!
You won't be able to do it.
Teacher!
I want to see you just once!
Just once!
I want to see you only once!
Come here!
You are Puliraju's cousin Gangamma, right?
Why did you come here?
I am helpless.
I came searching for you.
Help me.
Please speak softly.
Why did you come here?
My cousin is on his deathbed.
Day and night the only thing he says is 'Teacher!
'
His desire is to see your daughter before he dies.
I want to fulfill his last desire, so I came here.
I beg you.
I will beg anyone.
Please send your daughter with me.
I understand your situation.
If Jenny doesn't come there, only your cousin will die.
But if she comes there, we all will loose our lives.
Sir!
You are worried that your bird's nest will be destroyed.
But I am afraid that my bird itself will loose its life.
I don't know what to say to you and how to say it.
Lawrence and Jenny are getting close to each other.
If you talk about him now, they will become far again.
It's good that Lawrence is not at home now.
Before he comes back, you please go from here.
I will beg you, please go from here.
Is Gangamma gone?
- She's gone.
- Thank God!
We can't read anyone's heart.
We can't force anyone to do this or to do that.
Lawrence!
One man is fighting with his death to see Jennifer.
What's wrong if she goes and visits him just once?
I came to know Jenny's heart long before.
I can recognize anyone who is grieving at heart.
There's a difference between shaking hands with a person..
..and holding the hands of a person for the rest of your life.
A cage can be made of gold.
But the bird will have to decide if it wants to stay in that or not.
Jennifer!
My God!
Is that you?
Yes doctor!
I want to see Puliraju!
Where is he?
I am sorry.
It's not good for you to see him.
His condition is very hopeless.
Please sit down.
You became so emotional even though you are healthy.
You can't meet the patient in this condition
If he is emotionally disturbed, it may take his life.
I am sorry.
Excuse me madam!
You can see him from far without disturbing him.
"What's happening? "
"The heart that forgot its heart is going somewhere."
"What's happening? "
"The body is leaving its life and going."
"What's the use of eyes after all my dreams melted down? "
"Moon is left without its moonlight."
"What's happening? "
"The heart that forgot its heart is going somewhere."
"What's happening? "
I desired that you both meet each other.
My desire is fulfilled.
You both became one.
This is enough for my life.
Please give your child my name.
That will satisfy me.

Your road is long...
Written by Eduard Akopov
It is long and empty...
Directed by Alla Surikova
All that distance is not For those weak of heart...
Director of Photography Grigory Belenky
Your road is long...
Music by Gennady Gladkov Sound by Oleg Zilbershteyn
Lyrics by Yuly Kim
Performed by Larisa Dolina, Andrey Mironov, Mikhail Boyarsky
Oh prairie, oh prairie, The distance is great,
The Indian feathers, The steel of the Brits.
The price is absurd, But the payment is hard.
The principal thing Is to keep my hat on.
But I value in some sense
The thing that is kept in my hat.
That's how it goes!
You ride fast, you die young,
You ride slow, you never come.
So live and don't chicken out.
Let it all go it's way,
And you'll get what happens next.
- The Black Jack Gang!
- You'll get it, Jack!
Go, move it!
Why don't you shoot, God damn you?
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes, you!
- I don't have a weapon.
- Did you come here without one?
- I didn't come to kill.
- Then you'll get killed.
I don't get it, how can you read in such a minute?
Aren't you scared?
What one has a purpose in life, one is not afraid of death.
You weren't expected, sir.
Sammy, don't you want to greet me?
I greeted you the last time around.
Go!
Let's say good-bye then.
Well, Jack...
Don't worry, ma'am.
I'll just have a look.
Oh, such a leg...
What a leg!
10 to 1, sir, you're clutching your Bible with both hands.
For me, it's rather the Holy Writ.
- Preparing for a better life?
- I wish you the same.
I'm not in a hurry and I don't hurry you.
Careful, this is the world history of cinema.
- He doesn't seem to see well.
- But I can hear well.
I have to admit, grammar isn't my element, but even I can discern that some pages are empty.
It's the place for history, sir.
Dare it, and your name might be written there.
- They wait for their heroes.
- You say funny things, sir.
I wish I could listen to you some other time.
When I sent my 1st dozen to hell, my mommy told me, "Jack, if
you're guilty of something, it's only that you haven't met a good man in life".
Sign it here.
You took 50 grand from us.
It was 40, Andy.
I can count, you know.
No insurance company would trust my receipt.
Only if you don't negotiate it with its president first.
Money loves everyone.
Remember it, gentlemen, this country will be ruined by the corruption.
Have a good day, sir.
Who knows, our paths might still cross.
I'd be glad if they do.
- Our mommy has come!
- Oh my little birdies!
Mommy's here!
Why did you marry me?
I didn't know you were this dumb!
You did!
You did!
No way!
How do you do.
My friend, could you tell me where I could get...
You couldn't...
Mister, ask at the drugstore, they might have it.
Mrs. Parker, you should be confined to bed.
Yes!
Mrs. Parker!
Don't forget it, 10 drops before you shoot.
Before it, not after!
- Yes.
- No, did you get it?
Screw off...
Did you say something?
So you don't have anything to tell me?
A real man always has something to say, is he's a real man, of course.
Mr. King, your steak.
Sir, it was my steak.
That's right, it was yours.
Harry, put $10 on my account.
Looks like the entire 30.
Fly!
Your health!
Shall we relax?
- Let's go!
- Let's go!
I didn't invite you.
Hi there.
That's friends, Peppy!
Careful there.
Sorry.
Harry, put $4 on his account!
$4!
Fly!
- Billy, I'm standing here.
- You'll lie down now.
Harry, I owe you $11!
Rowdy-dowdy... $12!
Excuse me, for Gods sake.
I'd like to have a drink with you.
- I'd like a drink.
- I'm busy.
You refused.
Too bad.
Fly!
It's serious, Billy, it's 80.
- Yesterday it cost 50.
- What about an inflation?
Gentlemen, I pass.
Hello!
Hi!
I'd like a drink.
- Harry, what's my count?
- 180, Billy!
Let's make it even.
Fly away.
- A beauty.
- Sorry.
1, 2, 3... 4... 5, 6.
OK, guys, that's enough!
Time to clean up a bit.
You heard it, man.
The end!
The time has come,
And here we are!
Here we are, your babies!
That's it, enough scratching your heads,
Enough sucking on bottles,
You'd better clap your hands!
A soldier is loved for his dough,
An officer is loved for his uniform,
But I love the cowboy
Because he's the only one!
A cowboy, the hero of the magic dreams,
You excite me, I admit it,
Cowboy, a couple of tender words
You find for me and I'll go with you.
Your steak, sir.
In the rattle of the day, In the quiet of the night
I'll hear the words of love.
It's cold.
You only say it,
And I shall hear it.
Sir, it was my steak.
'Scuse me.
Where?
Sir...
- Harry, I owe you $100.
- Sorry, no credit.
I could lend it, if you don't mind.
Please.
Your steak, sir.
Sorry.
An actor is loved for his art,
A player is loved for his music,
But why I love the cowboy,
I'll tell only to him!
I like you, man.
- Billy.
- Johnny.
Cowboy, you're a swell guy,
You've been exciting me for years,
Cowboy, you're brave but the problem is,
You can't put 2 words together.
Just for me, find them and put them together,
I'll always hear you,
Just say it,
Say it, I'll hear you,
Tell me, I'll hear you,
I'll hear you.
Raise your leg higher, it'll be a success,
The legs should be clearly seen,
If a cowboy orders it, who's gonna refuse?
Guys, we are your babes!
A sailor is loved for his courage, a captain for his wine,
But why do I love my cowboy?
'Cause he has everything...
'Cause he has everything...
'Cause he has everything...
'Cause he has everything there.
I love her.
Friend, this is hopeless.
Ms. Little's heart is impregnable like Ft.
Knox.
Ft.
Knox is the national treasury.
You'd better have a drink.
A drink of water if I could.
Water...
- Water.
- C'mere, my pin.
Never drink this piss.
If you're used to it, your life won't be worth a brass fart.
We're relaxing, Johnny.
But a soul wants something grander.
Billy!
Something light and huge.
What did you say?
Light and huge?
That's why I'm here.
D'you have a white bed-sheet?
No, you missed my point.
Sorry.
Who has a white sheet?
Billy, I think your friend here tries to offend us.
Gentlemen...
I have a white sheet.
I even have 2 white sheets.
And both of them are yours.
I think Ft.
Knox throws a white sheet.
Over there, in the coach, there's my equipment.
If it's not too hard for you, could you do me a favor and just send someone to...
Are you deaf?
On the double!
Thank you.
Please take your seats.
Billy, I think 2 offences a day are too much.
It's not just this thing was hung on the wall, we're made to look at it!
Gentlemen, could you really think...
Mr. First, I'm at your service.
Just a sec.
Here you are.
I could never hurt your feelings.
Careful with this.
I'd like to suggest a different spectacle.
Go on, man!
I'm on my saddle already.
How could I kill the light?
Godspeed!
Attention!
You're witnessing the arrival of the train...
Looks like it won't stop at this station.
...to the St. Lazar Station in Paris.
Enough shooting!
What are you doing?
Where are you running?
My friends, it's not scary.
It's not scary at all, Diana, not in the least.
There has never been anything scary for me in the world.
But you succeeded in it.
I won't grudge you my only eye to have that feeling again.
Thank you.
Mr. First, your invention is a miracle.
Guys made a sieve out of my walls, so the repairs could cost $100.
The cinema isn't my invention, I just serve it.
May I drop dead if that thing doesn't clear the head better than whiskey.
Gentlemen, could anyone reproach me for not paying for my whiskey?
- No one could.
- Pay then.
Mr. First, I'm yours!
- Here, Harry.
- Thank you for trusting me.
Thank you again.
To continue.
Maestro, something easy.
The screen should be replaced though.
- Ms. Diana!
- Already.
Gentlemen, have I missed the train?
- Look.
- Stepped on it!
Have you seen him twisting his hose?
Johnny is a swell guy!
I think, gentlemen, it was a...
Comedy.
I'm sure, you realize, that rapture is the best when it's converted into gold.
I think 30% would be fine, huh?
I realize, this figure is an offence for a man of business.
What would you say about 40%?
OK, 50.
- This is a robbery!
- I don't need anything.
When I see a man who doesn't need anything,
I realize he'll take all of it!
I misjudged you, you're a hard nut to crack.
What would be your conditions?
Sir, turn around.
Have a look around.
Around, sir.
You'll see the world that is imperfect.
The country lost.
Blood, sin and avarice set us apart.
We've been driven to the edge, with only the abyss and eternal dark beyond it.
But there is a way out.
Yes, I saw it.
That unforgettable night when
I found myself at the Boulevard des Capucines in the Lumiere theater.
The cinematograph!
That's the Messiah that could change everything.
It will make us purer and better.
For that...
I can sacrifice everything.
Even my own life.
So you'll excuse me but any mention of the money seems sacrilegious to me.
The only thing I could allow is selling admission tickets for the lowest possible price, in order to guarantee the supply of new pictures.
I'm getting older.
To misjudge one man twice.
It had never happened before.
Make a decision!
You have the future of the cinema in your hands.
OK, Mr. First, we're agreed.
You can roll your films.
I won't charge you.
Thank you, Mr. McCue.
You're a generous person.
Raise your legs higher, and it'll be a success,
Only the legs should be seen,
If the cowboy orders it, who could refuse him?
Billy, I've arranged everything!
A sailor is loved for his courage, a captain for his wine,
But why I love my cowboy?
'Cause he has everything,
'Cause he has everything,
'Cause he has everything there.
Yes, I'm on time.
The water's disappeared.
Where's the water?
I'll give it to you.
Let me go.
From now on and forever,
Right now, in any weather,
Right here, and everywhere,
We'll live in a different way!
With no anger or sadness,
For the good of the earth,
We've long dreamt about it,
But could never do it.
Cinema, cinema, cinema,
We're crazy about you!
Yes, I see you're glad,
But afraid to be disappointed,
'Cause you've been duped many times before.
You don't need dreamers, Yes, sure, of course,
But I'm not a dreamer, And I know how...
From now on and forever,
Right now, in any weather,
Right here, and everywhere,
We'll liver in a different way!
With no anger or sadness,
For the good of the earth,
We've long dreamt about it,
But could never do it.
With no anger or sadness,
For the good of the earth,
We've long dreamt about it,
But could never do it!
Cinema, cinema, cinema,
We're crazy about you!
One more time!
Good morning!
It's good for some, and it's the last for others, sir.
I'd like to order something from you that looks like a big box.
It's called a coffin.
I'd rather call it a cradle for new life.
Are you a philosopher?
What was your school?
Harvard?
Some Washington courses?
What an I saying?
Where do they train philosophers nowadays?
Have you graduated?
Alas, a naive youth came here with his grand ideas.
To transform the world, to save the country.
Where are his ideas now?
Let's get back to business, though.
Do you know the size?
Yes, sure.
I'd like you to make a small window in the center.
It could be fun to look up from the netherworld.
And the door on the other side, to enter and exit at will.
It's my first time, when a corpse is prepared to this active afterlife.
- Here's the size.
- Where should I deliver?
Harry's Saloon.
The deposit.
I won't hurry you up.
I'm interested in the quality.
Hello, baby!
- Oh how cute we are!
- I like him too.
- Piss off, holy father!
- You'll regret it, daughter.
- Good morning, minister.
- Good morning, my son.
I'm sorry, I thought Ms. Little lives here.
'Scuse me, Mr. First, I didn't think it might be you.
Could this charming girl have have any enemies?
I wish they were!
They're a god-damned admirers!
Come in, Mr. First.
If you only knew how hard it is to remain a decent girl.
Especially if the girl... is beautiful as you are.
Flowers?
For me?
God damn it all!
Ms. Diana, what's wrong?
Oh Johnny, you're the first man in my life who ever brought me flowers.
Now my heart is forever yours.
The end.
Farewell, my love.
The destiny separates us, but you'll live forever in my heart.
God damn it!
Some people have all the luck!
They fall in love.
They go to theaters.
- To lie...
- Don't, Billy.
To libraries.
And how they behave: excuse me, please...
What about you, Hugh?
Have you ever said please in your life?
Oh would you shut up for Chrissakes?
I'm sick as it is.
That gentleman would say,
"Hugh, shut up, please".
Gentlemen!
It's not a secret for anyone that all of you declared your love to me one time or another.
I don't mention words you used.
But could any one of you, just once,
drop on your knees in front of me?
You're right, baby.
Personally, I could only manage
to slap your bottom.
What could be said here...
We're all shit and we swim in shit.
It seems to me, Billy King, that
you're trying to offend me.
Tale my Colt, Martin, and shoot me if I'm wrong.
I just think that "shit" is the wrong word to be used in a decent company, and...
I second that.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Please.
Harry, what's wrong with you?
Farewell, my love...
The fate separates us...
But you'll live forever in my heart...
I can't...
That's art for you!
This is something to live for.
Such things make you want to accomplish a lot.
I can't understand what's wrong with me,
Everything's like a dream and a reality,
And my heart beats in a new way,
Like I live afresh.
A magic ray
In the pitch darkness,
Thank you, oh thank you.
You're like a key
To my prison.
Thank you, oh thank you.
My pure ray, you illuminate my way,
You're not hot, but I'm ablaze,
You light up the dark, and thank you for that,
Oh thank you!
Mr. First, here's your ordered item.
- The size is yours.
- I'm much obliged.
Have a nice day.
Mr. Danly, we haven't seen you for ages.
You sure have had a lot of changes.
How interesting!
- Later.
- Should we deal a hand?
- I'd like to talk to you.
- I don't have time.
Harry, I'm dying of thirst.
I haven't seen you for ages, Danly.
Please.
What is it?
Water.
What?
You said you were dying of thirst and I gave you water.
You stinking skunk!
I've spent the whole month at my rancho without a drop of whiskey, and you give me water.
You cheap bastard.
You coyote and the coyote's son!
And you...
Danly, did you ask me for water or...
Whiskey, god damn it!
Have I ever asked you anything different?
Come on, Danly!
Gentlemen, my horse was the first in line in the morning.
I was next to Billy.
Bollocks, Hubert, I was next to Billy.
Martin was next to me, and we haven't seen you here at all.
Gentlemen, queue up for the admittance.
Please.
I need it badly!
Easy now!
Upon my honor, I'm broke.
I cry twice a day.
The first time, at night when I watch the film, then in the morning when I count the losses.
- Mister, where should I put it?
- As usual.
- Hi there, Danly.
- What have you brought?
Could I have a free ticket, mister?
You see, Danly, the dollar is devalued.
Harry, have it really come to the fact that the lads drink this cow slop?
Mr. Parker, please.
My Peggy says, if I come home no black eyes, it means I was with the girls, and not in the saloon.
She doesn't give me money.
- No.
- Mr. Bobby, one last time.
Mr. Thompson, I've been letting you in free for 2 weeks.
Clear the path.
OK then.
Then I'll shoot you.
Shoot, but I'll be replaced by someone else.
How do you do.
Sorry for bothering you, gentlemen, but let me through.
Please, be so kind.
The third shot!
Mr. Johnson, don't be late.
Here, stick it, the bloodsucker.
Please, sir.
Your habit of entering after the 3rd shot is irritating.
Martin...
Give me a black eye, if you could.
Please, I really need it.
This is for my old woman.
You must be crazy.
Thompson, how could I hit a man?
Who do you think I am?
But I love my cowboy, because he has...
Because I have...
I have everything!
So screw your cinematography!
They drink milk.
I'll have some rest.
Wait!
We used to dance for temptation,
And raised our legs without shame,
Now we dance a lot more modestly,
And we are moved by beauty.
A magic ray
In the pitch darkness,
Thank you, oh thank you.
You're like a key To my prison,
Thank you, oh thank you.
My pure light, you illuminate my way,
You're not hot, but I'm all aflame,
You light up my darkness, and thank you for that,
Oh thank you.
What a beautiful hand.
It looks like it was created to turn the projector's handle.
Your cinematograph is the whole world.
You've opened a wonderful magic window for me...
Which I will close.
Father, the cinema is the cure for the sick.
And the opium for the people.
Please stop it.
That's why I...
Love my cowboy...
Did you say anything?
Does it mean you have nothing to say?
A real man always have something to say.
If he is a real man.
- Your steak, Mr. King.
- Thank you, sir.
Where is it?
Here it is!
Here it is!
Your steak, Mr. King!
- Harry!
- Yes, Billy?
Well I...
Thanks for your reminding me, sir, that it was my steak.
- Did you want to say something?
- I wanted to say...
Harry, that it's time to serve forks for dinner.
A gentleman shouldn't eat with a knife only.
I'm sorry, sir, but I should remind you that you're in a place where films are shown.
We don't allow drinking liquor here, and carry it with you.
Go to hell with your film!
This shitty cinema of yours has turned us into cowardly mules.
Did I hear you correctly?
You said "shitty cinema"?
Yes, shitty cinema and cowardly mules.
I can forgive you mules, but only them.
Could you be so kind as to do me a favor?
At last!
Not here.
I wouldn't like to desecrate this place.
He didn't like cinema.
I'm poisoned by the cinema.
The films substituted everything for me.
I feel they're more valuable than money to me.
Please advise me, father.
I'm torn in two.
My son, listen to the voice of your heart.
For Lord speaks to you through it.
My father,
I'll be broke then.
My son.
Listen top your reason, for Lord gave it to you, so that you could listen to it.
Should I get rid of First?
What about the cinema?
Won't I see it again?
Do you really think that Lord could tolerate your indecision for your meager $10?
Here's a good fiance for you.
- But he's old.
- You're not going to boil him.
Johnny, I want us to have a baby.
Today, right now.
Now?
It's impossible, my dear.
There's time for everything.
We should get married first.
You deceive me.
Don't you want to have a baby?
People kiss in your films, and the next minute they have a baby.
We've surely kissed a lot.
Diana, how should I put it?
It's called editing.
First, people kiss.
Then some time passes, a month or a year.
Then they get married.
Some more time passes, and they have a baby.
In cinema all this is edited out.
A kiss...
A marriage...
And a baby.
Johnny, I want it like in the cinema.
Please edit it.
- Diana...
- Johnny...
The Comanches!
That's him.
Where's Diana?
First!
Comanches!
Stuffy!
Take it!
Johnson, follow me.
Harry, take the machine-gun to the attic!
- Take Diana upstairs.
- I'm going with you.
You take care for the device!
Comanches are at the path of war!
To work, gentlemen!
I'll die for First happily!
Peppy, we're going to see things we'd better never see.
Let's get to work, gentlemen!
Farewell, love!
The destiny... separates us.
Do it, Harry.
That damn woman!
We're done with now.
Hugh, how can you refer to a lady like this?
I'm gonna slap her out.
My hand won't touch a woman.
Gentlemen, I pass!
I'm out of ammo!
- Me, too!
- Stuffy!
There's none... that's it!
I don't see a woman among you.
A pale-faced one.
With her hair like a morning dawn.
- We didn't have a woman.
- Lies don't become a warrior.
I wish I could have a single cartridge.
I wouldn't miss that painted ape.
I forgive the pale-faced one his words.
He may have never heard of Sir Charles Darwin and he may not be aware that an ape
is our common ancestor.
Are you sitting in this booth?
Oh my chief, it is she!
I saw her the last moon.
If he lays a finger on her, I'll tear his throat out.
I'll take part, too.
2 tickets to the afternoon performance.
For me... and for my squaw.
You killed First and now mock us!
Woman, don't you dare touch my husband!
I wish I knew what are they dragging here.
Looks like a guillotine.
After Sir Charles Darwin
I can expect an electric chair from them.
- You're alive!
- Johnny!
You have a motion sickness!
My darling, you're safe.
I can't believe my eyes!
Calm down, dear.
The Indians just invited me to visit.
They asked me to arrange a seance for them.
Billy, set it up!
Please, come in.
No, I'd never sit with Injuns.
Mr. Atwood, cinema doesn't have borders and races.
Everyone's equal facing the screen.
Johnny, you're a saint.
- No charge today.
- A saint!
Where are you going?
Dad, what about me?
You're too little.
Right, and I'm not little to go the path of war.
- But when it comes to movies...
- Shame on you, White Feather.
You haven't celebrated your 16th spring yet.
It's my seat.
It's my seat.
Go away.
Chief, take that jacket off, I can't see anything.
If you jerk another time, I'll shoot you.
Harry, you asked me for a piece of advice.
Here it comes.
Get rid of First immediately.
Or he'll ruin you.
Get rid of him!
Drive him away!
That's it!
Stop!
Stop it.
What's wrong, Mr. McCue?
What do you want?
I won't allow it, you don't have a right!
Everyone watches it OK.
I suffer losses, and they don't even let me watch it!
Wait, gentlemen.
Harry just wants to say that he terminates Mr. First's lease of the premises.
That's all there is to it.
Right, Harry?
Yes!
Gentlemen, calm down!
I'll try to negotiate it.
Harry, a couple of words.
Billy, what could we talk about?
Go, Billy will explain.
Oh my pale-faced brother, tell me, is the cinema going to turn to the life of Comanches?
I have a smashing plot idea.
Yes, it's quite smashing.
Gentlemen, you have a problem with your sense of humor.
It was a joke!
Mr. First, continue, I pray.
I saw it, and my mind was clouded.
Not in the dead of night, not over blind walls and fences, but on a white sheet...
A daughter of man gave a man her... kiss!
The creatures of debauch and sin, that's your cinema!
That's why I say unto you: if you cherish your home...
Go, and drive away that God-awful Mr. First.
Hurry, women!
That's him!
I think it's worse than a Comanche attack.
He looks like needing help.
We want movies!
A woman is a movie-goer too!
I think, Peppy, that if a woman asks for something, she should be granted this by all means, or she'll take it herself.
Billy, set it up!
We want a film!
I'll kill him!
The art... cannot be destroyed!
Set it up!
For a couple of words.
I'm fine as it is.
You don't want to sit through it under the counter.
- There'll be no film.
- There will be, Harry.
The art doesn't burn!
- Right?
- Right!
Is it true?
You know, I'm so glad!
I'm just happy.
You know how I love cinema.
I do!
Let's go!
Let's talk about your love of it.
I hope, you'll remember this conversation.
Let go of me, it hurts!
Don't get underfoot.
Oh it's perfectly fine.
Father, stop it.
We didn't come here for this.
Don't do it.
Don't!
- Hi, Chico!
- Good morning, sir!
Good morning, Mr. First!
Good morning, Billy!
Is everything right?
If I undertake something, I do it.
- Everything's right.
- Mr. First.
- Good morning.
- Greetings.
Do you recognize me?
Sure!
You're the undertaker.
- An ex-philosopher.
- It's in the past now.
Good morning, Ms. Diana!
Time to wake up.
Good morning, Conchita.
Your sheet...
I mean, your screen... has been stolen!
Santa Maria, a drop to your feet.
Perform a miracle!
You know, in our town there's no more white sheets.
Santa Maria, you've always been so kind.
No time for pray.
Well, I'm unemployed now, because people don't want to part with their lives.
So I had a marvelous idea once, why don't we organize a printed edition in our town?
It could be entitled, say,
"Cinema", and it would cover only the cinematographic issues.
What's good there, and the main point, what's bad.
I've watched almost all films,
I start to have some ideas.
They might be interesting for other people, too.
What do you think of my idea?
I think that if a philosopher could become an undertaker, why doesn't an undertaker become a critic?
Quick, Conchita.
My darling, my love, hello.
Don't be cross with me.
Forgive me.
- Quick, Ms. Diana!
- Conchita, scissors.
Bear with it.
Put it here.
What if you won't be in time?
I should.
- I won't survive the shame.
- You won't do it!
Don't touch it.
A girl that couldn't save the most valuable thing she has for her husband to be, deserves death.
Billy, I'm showing it for the last time.
There's no more.
That's it.
No, not this.
The death is better!
The art, Concita, demands sacrifices.
We've made a new screen.
Take your seats, gentlemen.
The slave to love!
Why did you seek me?
Harry McCue?
Jack!
What can you do for money?
For money, I can do everything.
Here's $1000.
The life of the man named First.
Begging your pardon, miss.
Sir, some old woman is asking for you.
- For me?
- Yes, you.
She's afraid to cross the street, and says only you could help her.
My love,
I'll be back.
Billy...
Set it up!
Where's your granny?
Here you are.
Good evening.
Allow me to offer you help, miss.
So our paths have crossed, sir.
To tell you the truth, I don't enjoy it much.
Yes, I recognized you, "granny".
I offered you a place in history.
You should visit our seances by all means.
I invite you to the cinema.
I'm here!
You could cross the street in some other place, granny.
Johnny!
Bear with it, my friend.
My love...
Don't die!
Don't die...
Jesus, I wish I could start living anew...
How could I save you?
Only a miracle could save him now.
No!
You road... is long.
Wait, father.
Johnny...
Tell us your last...
No!
I swear... we'll fulfil it.
We swear!
Billy...
Set it up!
A genius!
Could I go with you anyway?
Don't worry, my friend, nothing bad will happen to me.
I hope he doesn't leave for long.
I can't picture a day without cinema.
Mr. First leaves for 3 days only to get wedding presents.
- When do they have the wedding?
- On Sunday.
Is it true that the priest refused to marry them?
It is.
Yet Billy persuaded him.
I can imagine how he did that.
Cinema, cinema, cinema,
We're crazy about you.
Get lost!
Cinema... cinema...
We're crazy about you.
Whom do you see off?
Oh, he was a great man!
Why was he great?
He was the first to introduce the cinema to us.
In this case, I'll be the next one.
My name's Second.
Are you the owner of this saloon?
- I am.
- I have a business proposal.
He unscrews his head.
The cranium must crackle now.
What a big, fat and delicious hand!
Now, the finger.
Andy, you forgot the second ear.
Well, excellent.
Guys, this is the real life.
Now, the leg...
How could you watch that junk?
That's awful shit, Mr. First.
I wish you knew how I miss your films!
They could've made me human.
But the truth is bitter, in this country only the money could make a gentleman human, and Mr. Second's films bring me money.
Mr. McCue, I've always suspected that a businessman would kill a movie-goer in you.
But you...
Billy, how could you like it?
I watched it from the corner of one eye.
Guys, enough sniveling!
You'll have the sequel!
Where's my steak?
Let me through, I have an urgent business.
Are you all right, Mr. First?
- Where's Diana?
- Upstairs, with the priest.
Mr. First, my life is in your hands.
But before you pull the trigger, you should know, you'll never find a man more faithful to you.
From Mexico to Canada.
I knew a lot of happiness, love of women and power of money, but all this is dust compared to this.
I'll dedicate my whole life to this God, if you would leave it to me, of course.
Say no more!
From now on, my Colt and my fists are at your service.
But before we set out from here...
I should take revenge on Mr. Second.
He desecrated the name of the cinema.
He sows the seeds of hatred in the audience's souls.
- He should die.
- Don't do it, Jack.
To each his own.
The future will judge us.
Let's move on, our audience's waiting!
Oil both of your Colts real good,
Oil your Winchester rifle, too,
And move on, because
You just had a fancy to move.
Let's go, that's all right,
Riding or walking.
I swear by the name of the bloodthirsty coyote,
We'll reach some destination!
What will be, will be,
Whatever might happen,
What will be, will be, And that's what there is.

The Man from the Boulevard des Capucines
Your road is long...
Written by Eduard Akopov
It is long and empty...
Directed by Alla Surikova
All that distance is not For those weak of heart...
Director of Photography Grigory Belenky
Your road is long...
Music by Gennady Gladkov Sound by Oleg Zilbershteyn
Lyrics by Yuly Kim Performed by Larisa Dolina, Andrey Mironov, Mikhail Boyarsky
Oh prairie, oh prairie, The distance is great,
The Indian feathers, The steel of the Brits.
The price is absurd, But the payment is hard.
The principal thing Is to keep my hat on.
But I value in some sense
The thing that is kept in my hat.
That's how it goes!
You ride fast, you die young,
You ride slow, you never come.
So live and don't chicken out.
Let it all go it's way,
And you'll get what happens next.
- The Black Jack Gang!
- You'll get it, Jack!
Go, move it!
Why don't you shoot, God damn you?
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes, you!
- I don't have a weapon.
- Did you come here without one?
- I didn't come to kill.
- Then you'll get killed.
I don't get it, how can you read in such a minute?
Aren't you scared?
What one has a purpose in life, one is not afraid of death.
You weren't expected, sir.
Sammy, don't you want to greet me?
I greeted you the last time around.
Go!
Let's say good-bye then.
Well, Jack...
Don't worry, ma'am.
I'll just have a look.
Oh, such a leg...
What a leg!
10 to 1, sir, you're clutching your Bible with both hands.
For me, it's rather the Holy Writ.
- Preparing for a better life?
- I wish you the same.
I'm not in a hurry and I don't hurry you.
Careful, this is the world history of cinema.
- He doesn't seem to see well.
- But I can hear well.
I have to admit, grammar isn't my element, but even I can discern that some pages are empty.
It's the place for history, sir.
Dare it, and your name might be written there.
- They wait for their heroes.
- You say funny things, sir.
I wish I could listen to you some other time.
When I sent my 1st dozen to hell, my mommy told me, "Jack, if
you're guilty of something, it's only that you haven't met a good man in life".
Sign it here.
You took 50 grand from us.
It was 40, Andy.
I can count, you know.
No insurance company would trust my receipt.
Only if you don't negotiate it with its president first.
Money loves everyone.
Remember it, gentlemen, this country will be ruined by the corruption.
Have a good day, sir.
Who knows, our paths might still cross.
I'd be glad if they do.
- Our mommy has come!
- Oh my little birdies!
Mommy's here!
Why did you marry me?
I didn't know you were this dumb!
You did!
You did!
No way!
How do you do.
My friend, could you tell me where I could get...
You couldn't...
Mister, ask at the drugstore, they might have it.
Mrs. Parker, you should be confined to bed.
Yes!
Mrs. Parker!
Don't forget it, 10 drops before you shoot.
Before it, not after!
- Yes.
- No, did you get it?
Screw off...
Did you say something?
So you don't have anything to tell me?
A real man always has something to say, is he's a real man, of course.
Mr. King, your steak.
Sir, it was my steak.
That's right, it was yours.
Harry, put $10 on my account.
Looks like the entire 30.
Fly!
Your health!
Shall we relax?
- Let's go!
- Let's go!
I didn't invite you.
Hi there.
That's friends, Peppy!
Careful there.
Sorry.
Harry, put $4 on his account!
$4!
Fly!
- Billy, I'm standing here.
- You'll lie down now.
Harry, I owe you $11!
Rowdy-dowdy... $12!
Excuse me, for Gods sake.
I'd like to have a drink with you.
- I'd like a drink.
- I'm busy.
You refused.
Too bad.
Fly!
It's serious, Billy, it's 80.
- Yesterday it cost 50.
- What about an inflation?
Gentlemen, I pass.
Hello!
Hi!
I'd like a drink.
- Harry, what's my count?
- 180, Billy!
Let's make it even.
Fly away.
- A beauty.
- Sorry.
1, 2, 3... 4... 5, 6.
OK, guys, that's enough!
Time to clean up a bit.
You heard it, man.
The end!
The time has come,
And here we are!
Here we are, your babies!
That's it, enough scratching your heads,
Enough sucking on bottles,
You'd better clap your hands!
A soldier is loved for his dough,
An officer is loved for his uniform,
But I love the cowboy
Because he's the only one!
A cowboy, the hero of the magic dreams,
You excite me, I admit it,
Cowboy, a couple of tender words
You find for me and I'll go with you.
Your steak, sir.
In the rattle of the day, In the quiet of the night
I'll hear the words of love.
It's cold.
You only say it,
And I shall hear it.
Sir, it was my steak.
'Scuse me.
Where?
Sir...
- Harry, I owe you $100.
- Sorry, no credit.
I could lend it, if you don't mind.
Please.
Your steak, sir.
Sorry.
An actor is loved for his art,
A player is loved for his music,
But why I love the cowboy,
I'll tell only to him!
I like you, man.
- Billy.
- Johnny.
Cowboy, you're a swell guy,
You've been exciting me for years,
Cowboy, you're brave but the problem is,
You can't put 2 words together.
Just for me, find them and put them together,
I'll always hear you,
Just say it,
Say it, I'll hear you,
Tell me, I'll hear you,
I'll hear you.
Raise your leg higher, it'll be a success,
The legs should be clearly seen,
If a cowboy orders it, who's gonna refuse?
Guys, we are your babes!
A sailor is loved for his courage, a captain for his wine,
But why do I love my cowboy?
'Cause he has everything...
'Cause he has everything...
'Cause he has everything...
'Cause he has everything there.
I love her.
Friend, this is hopeless.
Ms. Little's heart is impregnable like Ft.
Knox.
Ft.
Knox is the national treasury.
You'd better have a drink.
A drink of water if I could.
Water...
- Water.
- C'mere, my pin.
Never drink this piss.
If you're used to it, your life won't be worth a brass fart.
We're relaxing, Johnny.
But a soul wants something grander.
Billy!
Something light and huge.
What did you say?
Light and huge?
That's why I'm here.
D'you have a white bed-sheet?
No, you missed my point.
Sorry.
Who has a white sheet?
Billy, I think your friend here tries to offend us.
Gentlemen...
I have a white sheet.
I even have 2 white sheets.
And both of them are yours.
I think Ft.
Knox throws a white sheet.
Over there, in the coach, there's my equipment.
If it's not too hard for you, could you do me a favor and just send someone to...
Are you deaf?
On the double!
Thank you.
Please take your seats.
Billy, I think 2 offences a day are too much.
It's not just this thing was hung on the wall, we're made to look at it!
Gentlemen, could you really think...
Mr. First, I'm at your service.
Just a sec.
Here you are.
I could never hurt your feelings.
Careful with this.
I'd like to suggest a different spectacle.
Go on, man!
I'm on my saddle already.
How could I kill the light?
Godspeed!
Attention!
You're witnessing the arrival of the train...
Looks like it won't stop at this station.
...to the St. Lazar Station in Paris.
Enough shooting!
What are you doing?
Where are you running?
My friends, it's not scary.
It's not scary at all, Diana, not in the least.
There has never been anything scary for me in the world.
But you succeeded in it.
I won't grudge you my only eye to have that feeling again.
Thank you.
Mr. First, your invention is a miracle.
Guys made a sieve out of my walls, so the repairs could cost $100.
The cinema isn't my invention, I just serve it.
May I drop dead if that thing doesn't clear the head better than whiskey.
Gentlemen, could anyone reproach me for not paying for my whiskey?
- No one could.
- Pay then.
Mr. First, I'm yours!
- Here, Harry.
- Thank you for trusting me.
Thank you again.
To continue.
Maestro, something easy.
The screen should be replaced though.
- Ms. Diana!
- Already.
Gentlemen, have I missed the train?
- Look.
- Stepped on it!
Have you seen him twisting his hose?
Johnny is a swell guy!
I think, gentlemen, it was a...
Comedy.
I'm sure, you realize, that rapture is the best when it's converted into gold.
I think 30% would be fine, huh?
I realize, this figure is an offence for a man of business.
What would you say about 40%?
OK, 50.
- This is a robbery!
- I don't need anything.
When I see a man who doesn't need anything,
I realize he'll take all of it!
I misjudged you, you're a hard nut to crack.
What would be your conditions?
Sir, turn around.
Have a look around.
Around, sir.
You'll see the world that is imperfect.
The country lost.
Blood, sin and avarice set us apart.
We've been driven to the edge, with only the abyss and eternal dark beyond it.
But there is a way out.
Yes, I saw it.
That unforgettable night when
I found myself at the Boulevard des Capucines in the Lumiere theater.
The cinematograph!
That's the Messiah that could change everything.
It will make us purer and better.
For that...
I can sacrifice everything.
Even my own life.
So you'll excuse me but any mention of the money seems sacrilegious to me.
The only thing I could allow is selling admission tickets for the lowest possible price, in order to guarantee the supply of new pictures.
I'm getting older.
To misjudge one man twice.
It had never happened before.
Make a decision!
You have the future of the cinema in your hands.
OK, Mr. First, we're agreed.
You can roll your films.
I won't charge you.
Thank you, Mr. McCue.
You're a generous person.
Raise your legs higher, and it'll be a success,
Only the legs should be seen,
If the cowboy orders it, who could refuse him?
Billy, I've arranged everything!
A sailor is loved for his courage, a captain for his wine,
But why I love my cowboy?
'Cause he has everything,
'Cause he has everything,
'Cause he has everything there.
Yes, I'm on time.
The water's disappeared.
Where's the water?
I'll give it to you.
Let me go.
From now on and forever,
Right now, in any weather,
Right here, and everywhere,
We'll live in a different way!
With no anger or sadness,
For the good of the earth,
We've long dreamt about it,
But could never do it.
Cinema, cinema, cinema,
We're crazy about you!
Yes, I see you're glad,
But afraid to be disappointed,
'Cause you've been duped many times before.
You don't need dreamers, Yes, sure, of course,
But I'm not a dreamer, And I know how...
From now on and forever,
Right now, in any weather,
Right here, and everywhere,
We'll liver in a different way!
With no anger or sadness,
For the good of the earth,
We've long dreamt about it,
But could never do it.
With no anger or sadness,
For the good of the earth,
We've long dreamt about it,
But could never do it!
Cinema, cinema, cinema,
We're crazy about you!
One more time!
Good morning!
It's good for some, and it's the last for others, sir.
I'd like to order something from you that looks like a big box.
It's called a coffin.
I'd rather call it a cradle for new life.
Are you a philosopher?
What was your school?
Harvard?
Some Washington courses?
What an I saying?
Where do they train philosophers nowadays?
Have you graduated?
Alas, a naive youth came here with his grand ideas.
To transform the world, to save the country.
Where are his ideas now?
Let's get back to business, though.
Do you know the size?
Yes, sure.
I'd like you to make a small window in the center.
It could be fun to look up from the netherworld.
And the door on the other side, to enter and exit at will.
It's my first time, when a corpse is prepared to this active afterlife.
- Here's the size.
- Where should I deliver?
Harry's Saloon.
The deposit.
I won't hurry you up.
I'm interested in the quality.
Hello, baby!
- Oh how cute we are!
- I like him too.
- Piss off, holy father!
- You'll regret it, daughter.
- Good morning, minister.
- Good morning, my son.
I'm sorry, I thought Ms. Little lives here.
'Scuse me, Mr. First, I didn't think it might be you.
Could this charming girl have have any enemies?
I wish they were!
They're a god-damned admirers!
Come in, Mr. First.
If you only knew how hard it is to remain a decent girl.
Especially if the girl... is beautiful as you are.
Flowers?
For me?
God damn it all!
Ms. Diana, what's wrong?
Oh Johnny, you're the first man in my life who ever brought me flowers.
Now my heart is forever yours.
The end.
Farewell, my love.
The destiny separates us, but you'll live forever in my heart.
God damn it!
Some people have all the luck!
They fall in love.
They go to theaters.
- To lie...
- Don't, Billy.
To libraries.
And how they behave: excuse me, please...
What about you, Hugh?
Have you ever said please in your life?
Oh would you shut up for Chrissakes?
I'm sick as it is.
That gentleman would say,
"Hugh, shut up, please".
Gentlemen!
It's not a secret for anyone that all of you declared your love to me one time or another.
I don't mention words you used.
But could any one of you, just once,
drop on your knees in front of me?
You're right, baby.
Personally, I could only manage
to slap your bottom.
What could be said here...
We're all shit and we swim in shit.
It seems to me, Billy King, that
you're trying to offend me.
Tale my Colt, Martin, and shoot me if I'm wrong.
I just think that "shit" is the wrong word to be used in a decent company, and...
I second that.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Please.
Harry, what's wrong with you?
Farewell, my love...
The fate separates us...
But you'll live forever in my heart...
I can't...
That's art for you!
This is something to live for.
Such things make you want to accomplish a lot.
I can't understand what's wrong with me,
Everything's like a dream and a reality,
And my heart beats in a new way,
Like I live afresh.
A magic ray
In the pitch darkness,
Thank you, oh thank you.
You're like a key
To my prison.
Thank you, oh thank you.
My pure ray, you illuminate my way,
You're not hot, but I'm ablaze,
You light up the dark, and thank you for that,
Oh thank you!
Mr. First, here's your ordered item.
- The size is yours.
- I'm much obliged.
Have a nice day.
Mr. Danly, we haven't seen you for ages.
You sure have had a lot of changes.
How interesting!
- Later.
- Should we deal a hand?
- I'd like to talk to you.
- I don't have time.
Harry, I'm dying of thirst.
I haven't seen you for ages, Danly.
Please.
What is it?
Water.
What?
You said you were dying of thirst and I gave you water.
You stinking skunk!
I've spent the whole month at my rancho without a drop of whiskey, and you give me water.
You cheap bastard.
You coyote and the coyote's son!
And you...
Danly, did you ask me for water or...
Whiskey, god damn it!
Have I ever asked you anything different?
Come on, Danly!
Gentlemen, my horse was the first in line in the morning.
I was next to Billy.
Bollocks, Hubert, I was next to Billy.
Martin was next to me, and we haven't seen you here at all.
Gentlemen, queue up for the admittance.
Please.
I need it badly!
Easy now!
Upon my honor, I'm broke.
I cry twice a day.
The first time, at night when I watch the film, then in the morning when I count the losses.
- Mister, where should I put it?
- As usual.
- Hi there, Danly.
- What have you brought?
Could I have a free ticket, mister?
You see, Danly, the dollar is devalued.
Harry, have it really come to the fact that the lads drink this cow slop?
Mr. Parker, please.
My Peggy says, if I come home no black eyes, it means I was with the girls, and not in the saloon.
She doesn't give me money.
- No.
- Mr. Bobby, one last time.
Mr. Thompson, I've been letting you in free for 2 weeks.
Clear the path.
OK then.
Then I'll shoot you.
Shoot, but I'll be replaced by someone else.
How do you do.
Sorry for bothering you, gentlemen, but let me through.
Please, be so kind.
The third shot!
Mr. Johnson, don't be late.
Here, stick it, the bloodsucker.
Please, sir.
Your habit of entering after the 3rd shot is irritating.
Martin...
Give me a black eye, if you could.
Please, I really need it.
This is for my old woman.
You must be crazy.
Thompson, how could I hit a man?
Who do you think I am?
But I love my cowboy, because he has...
Because I have...
I have everything!
So screw your cinematography!
They drink milk.
I'll have some rest.
Wait!
We used to dance for temptation,
And raised our legs without shame,
Now we dance a lot more modestly,
And we are moved by beauty.
A magic ray
In the pitch darkness,
Thank you, oh thank you.
You're like a key To my prison,
Thank you, oh thank you.
My pure light, you illuminate my way,
You're not hot, but I'm all aflame,
You light up my darkness, and thank you for that,
Oh thank you.
What a beautiful hand.
It looks like it was created to turn the projector's handle.
Your cinematograph is the whole world.
You've opened a wonderful magic window for me...
Which I will close.
Father, the cinema is the cure for the sick.
And the opium for the people.
Please stop it.
That's why I...
Love my cowboy...
Did you say anything?
Does it mean you have nothing to say?
A real man always have something to say.
If he is a real man.
- Your steak, Mr. King.
- Thank you, sir.
Where is it?
Here it is!
Here it is!
Your steak, Mr. King!
- Harry!
- Yes, Billy?
Well I...
Thanks for your reminding me, sir, that it was my steak.
- Did you want to say something?
- I wanted to say...
Harry, that it's time to serve forks for dinner.
A gentleman shouldn't eat with a knife only.
I'm sorry, sir, but I should remind you that you're in a place where films are shown.
We don't allow drinking liquor here, and carry it with you.
Go to hell with your film!
This shitty cinema of yours has turned us into cowardly mules.
Did I hear you correctly?
You said "shitty cinema"?
Yes, shitty cinema and cowardly mules.
I can forgive you mules, but only them.
Could you be so kind as to do me a favor?
At last!
Not here.
I wouldn't like to desecrate this place.
He didn't like cinema.
I'm poisoned by the cinema.
The films substituted everything for me.
I feel they're more valuable than money to me.
Please advise me, father.
I'm torn in two.
My son, listen to the voice of your heart.
For Lord speaks to you through it.
My father,
I'll be broke then.
My son.
Listen top your reason, for Lord gave it to you, so that you could listen to it.
Should I get rid of First?
What about the cinema?
Won't I see it again?
Do you really think that Lord could tolerate your indecision for your meager $10?
Here's a good fiance for you.
- But he's old.
- You're not going to boil him.
Johnny, I want us to have a baby.
Today, right now.
Now?
It's impossible, my dear.
There's time for everything.
We should get married first.
You deceive me.
Don't you want to have a baby?
People kiss in your films, and the next minute they have a baby.
We've surely kissed a lot.
Diana, how should I put it?
It's called editing.
First, people kiss.
Then some time passes, a month or a year.
Then they get married.
Some more time passes, and they have a baby.
In cinema all this is edited out.
A kiss...
A marriage...
And a baby.
Johnny, I want it like in the cinema.
Please edit it.
- Diana...
- Johnny...
The Comanches!
That's him.
Where's Diana?
First!
Comanches!
Stuffy!
Take it!
Johnson, follow me.
Harry, take the machine-gun to the attic!
- Take Diana upstairs.
- I'm going with you.
You take care for the device!
Comanches are at the path of war!
To work, gentlemen!
I'll die for First happily!
Peppy, we're going to see things we'd better never see.
Let's get to work, gentlemen!
Farewell, love!
The destiny... separates us.
Do it, Harry.
That damn woman!
We're done with now.
Hugh, how can you refer to a lady like this?
I'm gonna slap her out.
My hand won't touch a woman.
Gentlemen, I pass!
I'm out of ammo!
- Me, too!
- Stuffy!
There's none... that's it!
I don't see a woman among you.
A pale-faced one.
With her hair like a morning dawn.
- We didn't have a woman.
- Lies don't become a warrior.
I wish I could have a single cartridge.
I wouldn't miss that painted ape.
I forgive the pale-faced one his words.
He may have never heard of Sir Charles Darwin and he may not be aware that an ape
is our common ancestor.
Are you sitting in this booth?
Oh my chief, it is she!
I saw her the last moon.
If he lays a finger on her, I'll tear his throat out.
I'll take part, too.
2 tickets to the afternoon performance.
For me... and for my squaw.
You killed First and now mock us!
Woman, don't you dare touch my husband!
I wish I knew what are they dragging here.
Looks like a guillotine.
After Sir Charles Darwin
I can expect an electric chair from them.
- You're alive!
- Johnny!
You have a motion sickness!
My darling, you're safe.
I can't believe my eyes!
Calm down, dear.
The Indians just invited me to visit.
They asked me to arrange a seance for them.
Billy, set it up!
Please, come in.
No, I'd never sit with Injuns.
Mr. Atwood, cinema doesn't have borders and races.
Everyone's equal facing the screen.
Johnny, you're a saint.
- No charge today.
- A saint!
Where are you going?
Dad, what about me?
You're too little.
Right, and I'm not little to go the path of war.
- But when it comes to movies...
- Shame on you, White Feather.
You haven't celebrated your 16th spring yet.
It's my seat.
It's my seat.
Go away.
Chief, take that jacket off, I can't see anything.
If you jerk another time, I'll shoot you.
Harry, you asked me for a piece of advice.
Here it comes.
Get rid of First immediately.
Or he'll ruin you.
Get rid of him!
Drive him away!
That's it!
Stop!
Stop it.
What's wrong, Mr. McCue?
What do you want?
I won't allow it, you don't have a right!
Everyone watches it OK.
I suffer losses, and they don't even let me watch it!
Wait, gentlemen.
Harry just wants to say that he terminates Mr. First's lease of the premises.
That's all there is to it.
Right, Harry?
Yes!
Gentlemen, calm down!
I'll try to negotiate it.
Harry, a couple of words.
Billy, what could we talk about?
Go, Billy will explain.
Oh my pale-faced brother, tell me, is the cinema going to turn to the life of Comanches?
I have a smashing plot idea.
Yes, it's quite smashing.
Gentlemen, you have a problem with your sense of humor.
It was a joke!
Mr. First, continue, I pray.
I saw it, and my mind was clouded.
Not in the dead of night, not over blind walls and fences, but on a white sheet...
A daughter of man gave a man her... kiss!
The creatures of debauch and sin, that's your cinema!
That's why I say unto you: if you cherish your home...
Go, and drive away that God-awful Mr. First.
Hurry, women!
That's him!
I think it's worse than a Comanche attack.
He looks like needing help.
We want movies!
A woman is a movie-goer too!
I think, Peppy, that if a woman asks for something, she should be granted this by all means, or she'll take it herself.
Billy, set it up!
We want a film!
I'll kill him!
The art... cannot be destroyed!
Set it up!
For a couple of words.
I'm fine as it is.
You don't want to sit through it under the counter.
- There'll be no film.
- There will be, Harry.
The art doesn't burn!
- Right?
- Right!
Is it true?
You know, I'm so glad!
I'm just happy.
You know how I love cinema.
I do!
Let's go!
Let's talk about your love of it.
I hope, you'll remember this conversation.
Let go of me, it hurts!
Don't get underfoot.
Oh it's perfectly fine.
Father, stop it.
We didn't come here for this.
Don't do it.
Don't!
- Hi, Chico!
- Good morning, sir!
Good morning, Mr. First!
Good morning, Billy!
Is everything right?
If I undertake something, I do it.
- Everything's right.
- Mr. First.
- Good morning.
- Greetings.
Do you recognize me?
Sure!
You're the undertaker.
- An ex-philosopher.
- It's in the past now.
Good morning, Ms. Diana!
Time to wake up.
Good morning, Conchita.
Your sheet...
I mean, your screen... has been stolen!
Santa Maria, a drop to your feet.
Perform a miracle!
You know, in our town there's no more white sheets.
Santa Maria, you've always been so kind.
No time for pray.
Well, I'm unemployed now, because people don't want to part with their lives.
So I had a marvelous idea once, why don't we organize a printed edition in our town?
It could be entitled, say,
"Cinema", and it would cover only the cinematographic issues.
What's good there, and the main point, what's bad.
I've watched almost all films,
I start to have some ideas.
They might be interesting for other people, too.
What do you think of my idea?
I think that if a philosopher could become an undertaker, why doesn't an undertaker become a critic?
Quick, Conchita.
My darling, my love, hello.
Don't be cross with me.
Forgive me.
- Quick, Ms. Diana!
- Conchita, scissors.
Bear with it.
Put it here.
What if you won't be in time?
I should.
- I won't survive the shame.
- You won't do it!
Don't touch it.
A girl that couldn't save the most valuable thing she has for her husband to be, deserves death.
Billy, I'm showing it for the last time.
There's no more.
That's it.
No, not this.
The death is better!
The art, Concita, demands sacrifices.
We've made a new screen.
Take your seats, gentlemen.
The slave to love!
Why did you seek me?
Harry McCue?
Jack!
What can you do for money?
For money, I can do everything.
Here's $1000.
The life of the man named First.
Begging your pardon, miss.
Sir, some old woman is asking for you.
- For me?
- Yes, you.
She's afraid to cross the street, and says only you could help her.
My love,
I'll be back.
Billy...
Set it up!
Where's your granny?
Here you are.
Good evening.
Allow me to offer you help, miss.
So our paths have crossed, sir.
To tell you the truth, I don't enjoy it much.
Yes, I recognized you, "granny".
I offered you a place in history.
You should visit our seances by all means.
I invite you to the cinema.
I'm here!
You could cross the street in some other place, granny.
Johnny!
Bear with it, my friend.
My love...
Don't die!
Don't die...
Jesus, I wish I could start living anew...
How could I save you?
Only a miracle could save him now.
No!
You road... is long.
Wait, father.
Johnny...
Tell us your last...
No!
I swear... we'll fulfil it.
We swear!
Billy...
Set it up!
A genius!
Could I go with you anyway?
Don't worry, my friend, nothing bad will happen to me.
I hope he doesn't leave for long.
I can't picture a day without cinema.
Mr. First leaves for 3 days only to get wedding presents.
- When do they have the wedding?
- On Sunday.
Is it true that the priest refused to marry them?
It is.
Yet Billy persuaded him.
I can imagine how he did that.
Cinema, cinema, cinema,
We're crazy about you.
Get lost!
Cinema... cinema...
We're crazy about you.
Whom do you see off?
Oh, he was a great man!
Why was he great?
He was the first to introduce the cinema to us.
In this case, I'll be the next one.
My name's Second.
Are you the owner of this saloon?
- I am.
- I have a business proposal.
He unscrews his head.
The cranium must crackle now.
What a big, fat and delicious hand!
Now, the finger.
Andy, you forgot the second ear.
Well, excellent.
Guys, this is the real life.
Now, the leg...
How could you watch that junk?
That's awful shit, Mr. First.
I wish you knew how I miss your films!
They could've made me human.
But the truth is bitter, in this country only the money could make a gentleman human, and Mr. Second's films bring me money.
Mr. McCue, I've always suspected that a businessman would kill a movie-goer in you.
But you...
Billy, how could you like it?
I watched it from the corner of one eye.
Guys, enough sniveling!
You'll have the sequel!
Where's my steak?
Let me through, I have an urgent business.
Are you all right, Mr. First?
- Where's Diana?
- Upstairs, with the priest.
Mr. First, my life is in your hands.
But before you pull the trigger, you should know, you'll never find a man more faithful to you.
From Mexico to Canada.
I knew a lot of happiness, love of women and power of money, but all this is dust compared to this.
I'll dedicate my whole life to this God, if you would leave it to me, of course.
Say no more!
From now on, my Colt and my fists are at your service.
But before we set out from here...
I should take revenge on Mr. Second.
He desecrated the name of the cinema.
He sows the seeds of hatred in the audience's souls.
- He should die.
- Don't do it, Jack.
To each his own.
The future will judge us.
Let's move on, our audience's waiting!
Oil both of your Colts real good,
Oil your Winchester rifle, too,
And move on, because
You just had a fancy to move.
Let's go, that's all right,
Riding or walking.
I swear by the name of the bloodthirsty coyote,
We'll reach some destination!
What will be, will be,
Whatever might happen,
What will be, will be, And that's what there is.

* 'CAUSE WE MET ONTHEWAY**
ARE YOU ASLEEP?
NO.
ME NEITHER...
OBVIOUSLY.
SLEEP OK?
I WOULDN'T REALLY CALL IT SLEEP.
MORE LIKE A...
TOE STRAIGHTENING BREAK.
YOU SOUND LIKE YOU ENJOYED YOURSELF LAST NIGHT.
I SEEM TO RECALL YOU HITTING HIGH C YOURSELF A COUPLE TIMES.
HOW ARE WE GONNA DO THIS, DAVID?
DO WHAT?
HOW ARE WE GONNA DO THIS?
YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE, HAVEN'T YOU?
YOU TAKE A CAB HOME AND WAIT FOR ME TO CALL.
CAN'T DO THAT.
I GOT AN IDEA.
WE DO WHAT JOHN AND YOKO DID-
EVERYTHING FROM BED.
WE'LL MEET CLIENTS HERE, SOLVE CASES.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I THINK I'D LIKE YOU TO TURN THAT WAY.
WHAT FOR?
I WANT TO TAKE A SHOWER.
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO LOOK AT YOU?
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING TO BE SHY ABOUT.
GUESS I'LL HAVE TO FEND FOR MYSELF.
HEY!
HO!
HEY!
SORRY.
YO!
SHOULD I PUT SOME COFFEE ON?
I DON'T HAVE TIME.
I HAVE TO RUN RIGHT OUT.
ANY CHANCE OF YOU DROPPING ME BY MY PLACE?
YOUR PLACE?
CAN'T YOU TAKE A CAB?
A CAB?
FORGET ABOUT IT.
I'LL JUST CALL MY PIMP.
HE'LL PICK ME UP ON THE CORNER.
I DIDN'T MEAN IT THAT WAY, DAVID.
I JUST REMEMBERED I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT.
IF I TAKE YOU HOME, I'LL BE LATE.
YEAH...
WELL, FORGET ABOUT IT.
NO PROBLEM.
GOOD MORNING, MISS DIPESTO.
MORNING, MISS HAYES.
MISS HAYES...
YES?
OH...
WHAT IS IT, MISS DIPESTO?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS,
BUT YOU LOOK GREAT TODAY.
NO, I DON'T.
I'LL BE IN MY OFFICE.
YES, MISS HAYES.
SORRY ABOUT THE...
COMPLIMENT.
* WOKE UP THIS MORNING MY HEAD WAS SO BAD *
* IT WAS THE WORST HANGOVER THAT I EVER DID HAVE *
WHAT'S UP, BOYS?
* IT WAS NO WINE I HAD ME TOO MUCH OF *
* IT WAS A DOUBLE SHOT OF MY BABY'S LOVE *
* YEAH, YEAH...*
DAVID?
DAVID!
COULD I HAVE A MINUTE OF YOUR TIME, PLEASE?
TAKE TWO, THEY'RE SMALL.
WHAT WERE YOU DOING OUT THERE JUST NOW?
PRETENDING LIKE I JUST GOT TO WORK.
YOU WERE SINGING.
SO?
SO, HOW'S IT SUPPOSED TO LOOK TO THOSE PEOPLE
WHEN YOU COME IN HERE SINGING?
SAME WAY IT LOOKS EVERY OTHER DAY
WHEN I COME IN HERE SINGING.
BUT IT'S NOT EVERY OTHER DAY.
IT'S THE DAY AFTER LAST NIGHT.
THEY DON'T KNOW THAT.
AND I WANT TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.
IT'S GONNA BE HARD TO DO THAT
IF YOU DON'T STOP ACTING SO DAMN HAPPY.
HA!
SO DAMN HAPPY?
I'M NOT ACTING ALL THAT DAMN HAPPY.
I'M JUST...
ACTING HAPPY.
AREN'T YOU HAPPY?
OF COURSE I'M HAPPY.
ARE YOU SURE?
I SAID I WAS HAPPY, DAVID.
I AM HAPPY!
DON'T TELL ME I'M NOT HAPPY WHEN I'M HAPPY.
WELL GREAT!
YOU'RE HAPPY, I'M HAPPY,
WE'RE ALL SLAP HAPPY.
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE I'M NOT ALL THAT HAPPY.
IT'S NOT THAT I'M NOT HAPPY.
IT'S JUST THAT I'M NOT HAPPY.
I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL.
TAKE IT FROM ME, YOU FEEL GREAT.
DON'T-DON'T DO THAT.
DON'T DO WHAT?
DON'T SAY THINGS LIKE THAT IN THE OFFICE.
BUT I ALWAYS SAY THINGS LIKE THAT IN THE OFFICE.
IT'S WHAT I DO.
LOOK, I AGREE.
MAYBE WE SHOULD WAIT A LITTLE WHILE
BEFORE WE SPRING IT ON THE EMPLOYEES.
WE'RE NOT SPRINGING ANYTHING ON THE EMPLOYEES.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IF THEY KNEW, THEY'D THINK WE'D BE ROCKING THE DESK
EVERY TIME WE'RE ALONE IN HERE.
DOES THE LOCK ON YOUR DOOR WORK?
STOP IT.
STOP WHAT?
STOP TALKING LIKE THAT.
STOP THINKING LIKE THAT.
I HATE THIS, DAVID.
I HATE FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE
AND WONDERING WHAT THE EMPLOYEES MIGHT BE THINKING
AND CRINGING EVERY TIME YOU MAKE A SUGGESTIVE REMARK.
SO DON'T DO IT.
THANK YOU.
AS USUAL, THE DEPTH OF YOUR SENSITIVITY IS STAGGERING.
COME ON, MADDIE.
LOOK, I KNOW YOU FEEL A LITTLE WEIRD,
I FEEL A LITTLE WEIRD MYSELF.
BUT IT'S A GOOD WEIRD.
SO WHAT IF IT TAKES A LITTLE TIME?
WE'LL WORK IT OUT.
I DON'T WANNA WORK IT OUT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I MEAN I DON'T WANNA WORK IT ALL OUT.
I WANT TO FORGET IT.
WHAT?
DAVID, LAST NIGHT WAS A MISTAKE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
I GOT ALL CAUGHT UP IN THE MOMENT,
AND EVERYTHING HAPPENED BEFORE I HAD TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT.
OK.
OK, I'LL BUY THAT.
YOU LOST YOUR HEAD,
NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR ACTIONS.
I'LL BUY THAT...
THE FIRST TIME.
BUT THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN THE SECOND TIME.
WELL, THE SECOND TIME I COULDN'T THINK STRAIGHT
BECAUSE I WAS STILL SHOCKED FROM THE FIRST TIME.
REALLY?
WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE THIRD TIME?
THIRD TIME?
WHAT THIRD TIME?
COME TO THINK OF IT, YOU WERE PRETTY QUIET.
I FIGURED YOU WERE JUST WORRIED ABOUT WAKING THE NEIGHBORS.
DAVID, STOP THIS!
I CAN'T DO THIS, I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS,
I CAN'T WORK LIKE THIS.
I CAN'T!
LET'S MAKE A PACT.
A WHAT?
A PACT THAT LAST NIGHT NEVER HAPPENED.
WHAT FOR?
BECAUSE IT NEVER SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED.
IT WASN'T MEANT TO HAPPEN.
IT MAKES EVERYTHING WRONG.
DAVID, THE TWO OF US ARE THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE THAT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
IF WE AGREE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN, THEN IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.
BUT IT DID.
BUT WE'LL MAKE A PACT THAT IT DIDN'T.
NO, IT DID.
AND I LIKE THAT IT DID.
AND I GOT A HOT NEWS FLASH FOR YOU, BABE,
SO DID YOU.
YES, I DID.
DID, DAVID.
PAST TENSE.
BUT NOT ANYMORE.
NOT NOW.
NOW I FEEL TERRIBLE.
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS PACT.
PACT, SCHMACT.
IT HAPPENED.
WE DID IT.
IT'S DONE.
WELL DONE, I MIGHT ADD,
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE NO PACT.
OF COURSE THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.
WHAT YOU WANT.
DAVID, DO YOU EVEN REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO ME LAST NIGHT?
YES, I REMEMBER WHAT I SAID LAST NIGHT.
I MEANT IT.
WELL, IF YOU REALLY MEANT IT,
YOU'LL MAKE THIS PACT.
COME IN.
THERE'S A WOMAN HERE TO SEE YOU.
I CAN TELL HER TO COME BACK IF IT'S A BAD TIME.
NO, NO.
IT'S A FINE TIME.
SEND HER IN.
I'M SORRY TO SHOW UP WITHOUT AN APPOINTMENT.
OH, IT'S A PERFECT TIME.
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT MISS...
KENDALL...
MARGARET.
HOW MAY WE HELP YOU, MISS KENDALL?
AN AMAZING THING HAS HAPPENED.
I'VE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH A WONDERFUL MAN.
AND HE'S FALLEN IN LOVE WITH ME.
I NEVER DREAMED THAT ANYTHING LIKE THIS COULD HAPPEN.
I'VE NEVER BEEN VERY, UM,
ADEPT AT ATTRACTING MEN'S ATTENTION.
I MEAN, I'M NOT VERY PRETTY,
AND ON TOP OF THAT, I'M RATHER SHY.
SO, UM, I GUESS I'D ACCEPTED
THAT I WOULD SPEND MY LIFE IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE,
UM, TRY TO BE HAPPY IN OTHER PEOPLE'S ROMANCES...
AND THEN, ONE NIGHT...
I MET THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MAN.
TO MY SURPRISE, HE CAME TO SEE ME THE NEXT DAY...
AND THE NEXT,
AND WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER EVER SINCE.
AND THE AMAZING THING IS HOW EASY
AND NATURAL IT ALL WAS RIGHT FROM THE START.
HE'S ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM.
CONGRATULATIONS.
IT'S THE BEST PROBLEM I'VE HEARD ALL WEEK.
WELL, MY FATHER, HE, UM, HE THINKS, UM...
WELL, YOU SEE, MY FATHER'S VERY WEALTHY.
HE'S A DOCTOR.
HE WORKS AT SAINT MATTHEWS MEDICAL CENTER.
ACTUALLY, HE OWNS IT.
OWNS IT?
YES...
ACTUALLY, HE OWNS SEVERAL HOSPITALS... 13.
FATHER'S WORKED VERY HARD ALL HIS LIFE
AND HE LIKES PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD, TOO.
ANYWAY, I GUESS I'M VERY WEALTHY.
I GUESS THAT'S HIS CONCERN.
I THINK HE THINKS THAT'S WHY ROBERT WANTS TO MARRY ME.
FATHER'S VERY PROTECTIVE.
MY, UM, MY MOTHER DIED A LONG TIME AGO,
AND I'M HIS ONLY CHILD,
AND HE DOESN'T WANT ME TO MARRY, UH...
INAPPROPRIATELY.
ROBERT'S A BARTENDER.
IT'S A FREE COUNTRY, MISS KENDALL.
YOU'RE OVER 18.
NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I'VE NEVER CONTRADICTED MY FATHER.
I COULDN'T DO THAT.
BESIDES, HE'S JUST TRYING TO PROTECT ME.
WELL, THE THING IS, I THINK IF MY FATHER HAD
SOME SORT OF OBJECTIVE PROOF THAT ROBERT LOVES ME,
THEN HE WOULD AGREE TO THE MARRIAGE.
OBJECTIVE PROOF?
THAT'S WHY I WANT TO HIRE YOU.
I WANT YOU TO PROVE THAT ROBERT LOVES ME.
UH-HUH.
AND HOW LONG HAS HE WORKED THERE?
NO, THAT SHOULD DO IT, IT'S A SMALL LOAN.
WE'RE JUST CONFIRMING THE APPLICATION.
THANK YOU.
YOU'VE BEEN VERY HELPFUL.
THOUGHT I HEARD A KNOCK.
MIND IF I COME IN?
MIND?
NOT AT ALL, PARTNER.
COME ON IN.
MADE A FEW CALLS ABOUT ROBERT MURPHY.
DID SOME CHECKING UP.
DO TELL.
THOUGHT WE COULD COMPARE NOTES.
GREAT IDEA,
IF I HAD ANY NOTES TO COMPARE.
TRUTH IS-
I'VE BEEN ONE WITH THIS CHAIR
FOR THE BETTER PART OF THE MORN.
I TRIED TO WORK UP THE STEAM TO GO OUT AND SNOOP AROUND,
BUT DID YOU EVER HAVE ONE OF THOSE DAYS
WHERE EVERYTHING FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE CATCHES UP WITH YOU?
NOT THAT I WENT ANYWHERE, OR SAW ANYONE.
IN FACT...
THERE'S NOT A SOUL THAT CAN SAY I WASN'T
EXACTLY WHERE I SAID I WAS.
THE OLD HOMESTEAD,
ALL BY MY LONESOME,
FILLING THE SALT SHAKERS,
RE-GROUTING MY TILE,
DISCOVERING THE REAL REASON CLEANING WOMEN DON'T DO WINDOWS.
WHAT DID YOU DO LAST NIGHT, PARTNER?
ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SHARE WITH THE CLASS?
MAYBE I SHOULD COME BACK LATER.
NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT.
YOU'VE BEEN KEEPING YOUR NOSE,
OR ANYTHING ELSE, TO THE GRINDSTONE
TO DIG UP SOME DIRT,
LET'S HEAR WHAT YOU GOT.
DAVID...
LET'S HEAR WHAT YOU GOT.
FINE.
HERE'S WHAT I GOT.
ROBERT MURPHY:
TWICE DIVORCED,
EACH MARRIAGE LASTING LESS THAN A YEAR,
NEVER FINISHED COLLEGE, HE'S HELD A COUPLE OF JOBS SINCE THEN,
BARTENDER SHOWS UP A FEW TIMES ON HIS RESUME.
THAT'S WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING SINCE DECEMBER
AT A PLACE CALLED GEORGE AND HARRY'S BAR.
BEFORE THAT HE WAS UNEMPLOYED FOR ALMOST 6 MONTHS.
NO HISTORY OF BAD CHECKS, BUT HIS CREDIT CARDS ARE AT THE LIMIT.
I HAVE SOME OTHER CALLS OUT.
I SHOULD HAVE SOME MORE FACTS BY THIS AFTERNOON.
MORE FACTS?
IT'S QUITE A MOUTHFUL YOU HAVE THERE, ISN'T IT?
I DON'T KNOW.
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
ABOUT WHAT?
ABOUT THE IRISHMAN MARRYING INTO CLOVER.
I DON'T THINK ANYTHING YET.
ALL THOSE FACTS AND NOTHING TO GO ON?
WELL, IT'S A PLACE TO START.
HA HA HA.
START?
YOU'RE OUT OF THE BLOCKS,
NEARING THE TAPE, THE CROWD'S ON ITS FEET,
YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO CROSS THE FINISH LINE.
OK.
YOU TELL ME, WHAT SHOULD I THINK?
THOSE FACT OF YOURS PAINT QUITE A PICTURE.
LIKE WHAT?
THE CAT AND THE GILDED CANARY?
THE BLOODSUCKER GETTING THE BLOOD BANK?
THE HAVE-NOTS TAKING THE HAVE
FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE, BUT ESPECIALLY FOR BETTER?
TWO PEOPLE WITH ONE THING IN COMMON,
AND IT SURE AIN'T LOVE?
YOU COULD SAY THAT.
SURE AS HELL COULD.
I TAKE IT THAT'S YOUR OPINION.
MY OPINION?
NO.
MY OPINION SAYS THAT YOUR FACTS DON'T MEAN A DAMN THING
WHEN IT GETS DOWN TO THE YING AND YANG
OF WHY TWO PEOPLE WANT TO BE TOGETHER.
YOU TAKE YOUR ROMEO AND JULIET-
NOW HERE'S A COUPLE KIDS WHO WANTED TO BE TOGETHER.
TRIPPED OVER A FEW FACTS ON THE WAY TO THE ALTAR,
WOUND UP IN A MAUSOLEUM BUILT FOR TWO,
WHICH, I GUESS IS MY WAY OF SAYING
THAT I'LL COAST OVER TO GEORGE AND HARRY'S,
QUAFF A FEW COLD ONES WITH MR. MURPHY,
AND GET THE REAL SKINNY.
WHICH COMES FROM A REGION JUST SOUTH OF THE BRAIN.
WHEN I COME BACK, WE'LL COMPARE FACTS.
OH, MR. ADDISON?
THIS IS MR...
KENDALL.
OH, MISS HAYES?
THIS IS MR. KENDALL.
MR. KENDALL?
THE FATHER...
OF THE BRIDE.
OH, OF COURSE.
WON'T YOU COME IN?
HAVE A SEAT, MR. KENDALL.
I LIKE TO STAND, THANK YOU.
HOW CAN WE HELP YOU?
I BELIEVE MY DAUGHTER HAS HIRED YOU
TO INVESTIGATE THE MAN SHE INTENDS TO MARRY.
MR. KENDALL, I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER,
BUT WE CAN'T DISCUSS OUR CLIENTS WITH YOU OR ANYONE ELSE.
ALL CASES ARE CONFIDENTIAL.
OF COURSE THEY ARE.
I ADMIRE YOUR PROFESSIONALISM.
AND IN THAT SPIRIT,
I'D LIKE TO HIRE YOU MYSELF.
HIRE US.
FOR WHAT?
TO LOOK INTO MR. MURPHY'S PAST.
TO FIND WHAT YOU CAN ABOUT HIS WORK HABITS,
RELIABILITY, AND HIS DEALINGS WITH OTHER WOMEN...
MR. KENDALL, IT WON'T BE NECESSARY TO...
HIRE YOU FOR A JOB YOU'RE ALREADY DOING.
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE, MISS HAYES.
I INTEND TO ENSURE THE OUTCOME.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
ON THE OFF-CHANCE THAT YOUR INVESTIGATION
LACKS THE FUNDING IT MAY REQUIRE,
I THOUGHT PERHAPS $10,000 MIGHT FACILITATE YOUR EFFORTS
TO TURN UP ADEQUATE EVIDENCE.
YOU'RE BRIBING US TO FALSIFY OUR INVESTIGATIONS
TO TURN YOUR DAUGHTER AGAINST HER FIANCEE?
IN A NUTSHELL.
YOU'LL HAVE TO LEAVE, MR. KENDALL.
HEAR ME OUT, MISS HAYES.
I HAVE TO DO THIS.
FOR MY DAUGHTER.
MARGARET...
IS SPONTANEOUS.
SHE'S RULED BY HER EMOTIONS,
SHE PAYS LITTLE,
IF ANY, ATTENTION TO LIFE'S WARNING SIGNS.
AND AS SUCH, SHE HAS ALMOST NO SENSE
OF THE PRACTICAL EFFECT OF HER DECISIONS.
IN PLAIN TRUTH...
I DON'T BELIEVE SHE'LL BE DISSUADED BY THE FACTS.
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, MR. KENDALL,
THAT SHE SEEMS TO BE VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH HIM.
I SUPPOSE...
IF I WERE A YOUNG WOMAN,
A FAIRLY PLAIN, YOUNG WOMAN,
NEVER HAVING BEEN SOUGHT AFTER,
I MIGHT LOVE HIM, TOO.
HE'S HANDSOME.
HE'S CHARMING.
HE MAKES HER HAPPY.
THAT'S IMPORTANT.
LIFE ISN'T OFTEN ABOUT HAPPINESS, MISS HAYES.
IT'S ABOUT REALITIES.
CONTROL THE REALITIES,
AND THEN, MAYBE,
YOU CAN TRY FOR THE REST.
AND THE REALITY HERE IS THAT ROBERT MURPHY WANTS ONE THING
AND ONE THING ONLY-
MY MONEY!
I'M SORRY, MR. KENDALL.
I HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO OUR CLIENT.
THEN OUR BUSINESS IS FINISHED.
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR A NICE, TALL, COLD ONE.
DIDN'T YOU USED TO WORK AT SALOON'S?
NOPE.
MAN, I COULD SWEAR I'VE SEEN YOU SOMEWHERE.
BLUE ONION?
DID YOU USED TO WORK THERE?
I USED TO GO IN THERE ALL THE TIME.
YEAH, I DID A HITCH OVER THERE.
MURPH, RIGHT?
THAT'S RIGHT.
DAVE.
HI, DAVE.
IRISH, NEAT, WATER BACK.
SORRY, I FORGOT.
OH, DOESN'T MATTER.
I HAVEN'T BEEN TO THE BLUE ONION
FOR A LONG TIME.
THAT'S JOINT'S A REAL MEAT MARKET, ISN'T IT?
YEAH, IT USED TO BE.
I HEAR IT'S CALMED DOWN A LOT.
I USED TO SLIDE IN THERE ON FRIDAY NIGHTS,
WALL TO WALL BODIES.
GRADE A, PRIME CUT,
I MEAN I THOUGHT I DIED AND WENT TO HEAVEN.
I IMAGINE YOU MUST HAVE A FEW COCKTAIL NAPKINS
WITH SOME PRETTY INTERESTING NUMBERS ON THEM?
IT'S NOT MY LOCAL.
THAT'S WHY I LEFT.
COULDN'T KEEP YOUR MIND OFF THE CLIENTELE, HUH?
LOOK, DON'T GET ME WRONG,
I DON'T HAVE A PREJUDICED BONE IN MY BODY,
AND THEY'RE THE NICEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, GREAT TIPPERS, TOO,
WHICH IS WHY I STAYED AFTER THE MANAGEMENT CHANGED,
BUT I COULD NEVER GET USED
TO WATCHING YOU GUYS DANCE WITH EACH OTHER.
YEAH.
WELL, THAT DOES TAKE SOME GETTING USED TO,
DOESN'T IT?
YEAH, I MEAN, IT'S A LUSH LIFE, MAN,
WHATEVER GETS YOU THROUGH THE NIGHT.
SEE YOU LATER, MURPH.
SHEILA, SEE YOU LATER.
HERE'S TO WOMEN.
EACH AND EVERY LONG LEGGED ONE OF 'EM.
HOW DOES THE GOOD LORD EXPECT YOU TO PICK ONLY ONE
WHEN THERE'S SO MANY TO CHOOSE FROM?
I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID
FOR WAITING FOR THE RIGHT PERSON TO COME ALONG.
SPOKEN LIKE A MAN WHO DID...
OR HAS.
YEAH, COULD BE.
PERFECT WOMAN, HUH?
22, TALL,
INTELLIGENT BUT NOT BOOKISH,
KNOCKED OUT BODY,
AND A BIG FAT JUICY TRUST FUND TO MATCH.
NONE OF THAT MATTERS, BELIEVE ME.
I'VE BEEN WITH A LOT OF WOMEN.
I'VE PARTIED WITH THEM,
I'VE LIVED WITH THEM,
AND I EVEN MARRIED A COUPLE OF 'EM.
BUT NOT ONE'S EVER BEEN A FRIEND.
'TILL NOW.
WHAT IS THIS, A SURVEY?
SO...
WHERE DID YOU MEET THIS JEWEL
IN THE CROWN OF WOMANHOOD?
TRAFFIC SCHOOL.
HA HA.
IT WAS ON A COFFEE BREAK.
SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY CHANGE, SO I SPOTTED HER A CRUELLER.
AND THEN I CAME BACK THE NEXT NIGHT,
EVEN THOUGH I GRADUATED THE NIGHT BEFORE...
JUST TO TALK TO HER.
GONNA MAKE AN HONEST WOMAN OUT OF HER?
YOU'RE AN INQUISITIVE ONE.
COME ON, IT JUST...
SOUNDS LIKE LOVE.
THAT'S ALL.
BOY MEETS GIRL, FALL IN LOVE,
THEY USUALLY GET MARRIED.
AT LEAST, THAT'S THE WAY I HEAR.
WELL, WE'VE GOT SOME PROBLEMS TO IRON OUT.
SHE GOT COLD FEET?
REAL COLD.
OH, NOT ABOUT MARRYING ME.
NO, IT'S, UH...
IT'S HER FAMILY.
I MEAN, IT'S THE KIND OF FAMILY
THAT HAS LIBRARIES NAMED AFTER 'EM.
PLUS MY FOLKS...
I TOOK HER HOME AND MY OLD MAN
PUT ON HIS BEST UNDERSHIRT JUST FOR THE OCCASION.
ANYWAY, IT'S A PROBLEM.
WE'LL GET PAST IT.
SEE, I JUST DON'T WANT HER TO THINK
THAT ME AND HER ARE SOME KIND OF ACCIDENT...
SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED.
EXCUSE ME.
GEORGE AND HARRY'S.
LOOK, I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.
ALL RIGHT.
BYE-BYE.
HEY, SMITTY, COVER FOR ME, WOULD YA?
I GOTTA SPLIT.
SURE, NO PROBLEM.
YOU'RE A GOOD LISTENER, MAN.
YOU OUGHT TO BE A BARTENDER.
THANKS.
GOOD NIGHT, MR. ADDISON.
GOOD NIGHT, MR. ADDISON.
GOOD NIGHT.
'NIGHT, BOSS.
MR. ADDISON, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE BACK.
HERE'S SOME MORE BACKGROUND INFO ON THE KENDALL CASE.
MISS HAYES AROUND?
SHE WENT HOME EARLY.
SAID SHE DIDN'T GET MUCH SLEEP LAST...
NIGHT.
HER NEIGHBOR'S POMERANIAN KEPT HER UP.
YIP, YIP, YIP ALL NIGHT LONG.
MAYBE SAM SNORES.
SAM'S GONE.
HE IS?
THAT'S TERRIFIC.
ISN'T IT?
YEAH, IT'S TERRIFIC.
SO, I GUESS THINGS WILL GO BACK TO NORMAL
BETWEEN YOU AND MISS HAYES.
YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS WITH THIS CASE?
THESE PEOPLE WANT TO BE TOGETHER.
THESE PEOPLE SHOULD BE TOGETHER.
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
YOU'RE RIGHT, MISS DIPESTO.
THERE IS NO PROBLEM.
OH...
WELL, 'NIGHT, MR. ADDISON.
YES, MARGARET KENDALL, PLEASE.
WHAT?
FATHER WAS IN THE GUEST COTTAGE,
READING, LIKE HE DOES EVERY NIGHT,
AND I CAME HOME FROM THE STABLES THE SAME TIME AS EVERY NIGHT.
AND I WENT OUT TO SAY HELLO TO HIM AND...
ROBERT CAME UP IN THE CONVERSATION LIKE HE DOES EVERY NIGHT.
I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU WHAT FATHER SAID THAT WAS ANY DIFFERENT,
ANY WORSE THAN BEFORE.
I JUST, UM...
LASHED OUT, MR. ADDISON.
I HIT HIM.
THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY TIMES I'VE WANTED TO,
AND THIS TIME...
HE FELL AND HIT HIS HEAD.
HE WAS JUST LYING THERE, UNCONSCIOUS.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAME OVER ME.
I HARDLY EVEN REMEMBER DOING IT,
BUT I DID.
I JUST...
TURNED THE GAS ON, ON THE OVEN,
AND WALKED OUT THE DOOR.
I WAS IN THE HOUSE WHEN I HEARD IT.
I DON'T REMEMBER WHERE, EXACTLY, OR WHAT I WAS DOING,
BUT IT WAS QUITE AN EXPLOSION.
SHE DONE DOOD IT.
SHE DID?
DOOD?
DAMN!
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO COME DOWN HERE YOU KNOW.
I COULD HAVE TAKEN A CAB.
DON'T BE STUPID, DAVID.
YOU CALLED, I CAME.
I CALLED TO TELL YOU WHAT WAS GOING ON.
NOT TO GET YOU OUT HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
DAVID, I CAME DOWN HERE BECAUSE I WANTED TO COME DOWN HERE.
I THOUGHT MISS KENDALL MIGHT NEED MY HELP.
SHE'S MY CLIENT, TOO.
OK.
LONG AS THAT'S WHY YOU CAME.
THAT'S WHY I CAME.
YOU'RE COMFORTABLE, I'M COMFORTABLE.
I'M VERY COMFORTABLE.
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK
I WAS TRYING TO GET YOU OUT HERE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
I MEAN, GIVEN WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MIDDLE OF LAST NIGHT,
AND HOW YOU FELT ABOUT IT THIS MORNING.
I MEAN, PERSONALLY, I DON'T FEEL THAT WAY,
BUT I KNOW YOU DO,
SO, I JUST DIDN'T WANT YOU TO THINK
THAT I WAS PULLING SOMETHING.
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE PULLING SOMETHING.
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE PULLING ANYTHING.
NOT THAT I'D MIND PULLING SOMETHING.
QUIT WHILE YOU'RE AHEAD.
WE'RE HERE.
WELL...
WELL.
DAVID, DON'T THINK I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT?
DON'T THINK I DON'T KNOW
HOW UNFAIR THIS ALL SEEMS TO YOU.
MY POINT OF VIEW
OF EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED-
THE PACT, ALL OF IT-
I DO KNOW.
BUT I ALSO FEEL THAT IT'S RIGHT.
WE'VE DONE THE RIGHT THING.
WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING.
AND I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE
YOUR RESPECT FOR MY FEELINGS.
YEAH, WELL.
AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROOF OF THIS IS?
THE PROOF THAT ALL OF THIS,
THE PACT, OUR BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP,
OUR FRIENDSHIP WILL WORK,
THE PROOF OF IT IS THAT HERE WE ARE,
IT'S 2:30 IN THE MORNING,
WE'RE SITTING IN A CAR, BY OURSELVES,
ALL ALONE ON A DARK STREET,
AND WHAT ARE WE DOING?
WE'RE TALKING.
WE'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION,
AND THAT'S ALL WE'RE DOING.
I LIKE THIS, DAVID.
IT MAKES ME FEEL COMFORTABLE.
I APPRECIATE THIS, AND I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT.
WELL, OK.
GOOD.
I HAVE TO BE-
LOOK, I GOTTA BE HONEST WITH YOU.
I'M NOT HAVING AN EASY TIME WITH THIS.
I KNOW.
I MEAN, I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,
AND I KNOW YOU MEAN IT,
AND I KNOW THAT IT MAKES YOU FEEL...
COMFORTABLE.
YES, IT DOES.
I'M JUST NOT QUITE THERE YET.
IT TAKES TIME.
THERE'S A BIG PART OF ME THAT CAN'T HELP
WANTING TO FIND THAT SPOT ON YOUR NECK.
IT'S VERY UNDERSTANDABLE-
WHAT SPOT ON MY NECK?
YOU KNOW THAT LITTLE SPOT ON THE BACK OF YOUR NECK
JUST BELOW YOUR HAIRLINE?
OH, YEAH.
THERE.
KIND OF...
BRUSH MY LIPS AGAINST IT.
NOT HARD OR ANYTHING.
NO, NO, I UNDERSTAND.
AND MAYBE UNBUTTON YOUR BLOUSE.
DAVID...
BUTTON BY BUTTON.
OHH...
I THINK THIS CONVERSATION'S TAKING A TURN.
THEN MAYBE...
SOME LITTLE BABY KISSES DOWN YOUR SPINE.
THIS IS HARD FOR YOU.
YEAH.
WHICH UNDERSCORES MY POINT AND MY APPRECIATION.
THEN, I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE...
SOME LITTLE ÁNGEL KISSES ON YOUR BELLY.
MMM, WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE THE PACT.
WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE THE PACT.
WELL...
WELL...
DAVID!
DAVID!
DAVID!
I THINK WE NEED A NEW PACT.
WHAT?
A NEW PACT.
I THINK WE NEED ONE.
WHAT WE JUST DID INVALIDATES THE OLD ONE.
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT?
I'M JUST SAYING THAT BEFORE THIS GOES ANY FURTHER,
NOW WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO PUT A STOP TO THIS.
MAKE A NEW PACT...
I HATE THIS PACT CRAP.
I'M NOT DOING THIS TO HURT YOU, I'M DOING THIS-
BECAUSE YOU'RE NUTS.
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE DOING THIS.
THAT'S NOT A PRODUCTIVE THING TO SAY, AFTER WE JUST MADE LOVE,
JUST BEFORE WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A NEW PACT.
I JUST FIGURED IT OUT.
FIGURED WHAT OUT?
WHY YOU'RE 36 YEARS OLD AND STILL BY YOURSELF.
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
WHAT IS WITH THE PACT CRAP?
IT'S NOT CRAP!
YES, IT IS!
IT ISN'T!
YES, IT IS!
IT'S NOT!
IT'S JUST A WAY FOR ME TO...
TO WHAT?
TO MAKE SENSE!
OF WHAT?
OF THIS!
OF WHAT?
OF US!
DAVID, I DIDN'T PLAN THIS-I UNPLANNED THIS.
I SPENT ALL DAY TODAY SWEARING TO MYSELF THIS WOULDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN,
THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.
NOT WITH YOU.
NOT EVER.
AND HERE WE ARE.
WHY DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING?
THE SAME REASON CHRISTMAS KEEPS HAPPENING.
BECAUSE IT'S TERRIFIC, THAT'S WHY.
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING'S TERRIFIC
DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE TO LIKE IT!
YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT?
FINE!
JUST BECAUSE I LIKE SOMETHING...
UGH!
TO HELL WITH YOU, DAVID.
THIS IS NOT THE WAY I LIVE MY LIFE.
I DON'T JUST GIVE MYSELF TO PEOPLE.
I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT, CONSIDER, CONTEMPLATE.
AND WHEN I DO, IF I DO,
WELL, IT ISN'T LIKE THIS-
ALL WILD AND FRENZIED.
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS PLACE.
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY LIGHTS, YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FURNITURE,
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THESE SHEETS WERE CHANGED?
CAN'T WE JUST TALK ABOUT HOW TERRIFIC IT IS FOR A MINUTE?
I'M SORRY.
I JUST DON'T FEEL RIGHT ABOUT IT.
WHY DO YOU KEEP SAYING THAT?
WHY ARE YOU SO UPSET?
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS GET THE SHEET?
HEY.
HEY.
IS THIS ABOUT WORK?
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?
'CAUSE IF IT IS,
IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL ANY BETTER,
I'LL FIND A JOB SOMEWHERE ELSE.
IT'S NOT THAT.
WELL, THEN WHAT IS IT?
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, DAVID.
WE DON'T MAKE SENSE.
YOU'RE NOT WHO I'M SUPPOSED TO BE WITH.
I SEE.
WELL...
I'M SORRY, BUT I JUST DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY.
WELL, OF COURSE YOU DON'T SEE IT LIKE THAT.
I'M EXACTLY WHO YOU WANT TO BE WITH.
OH, GREAT.
NOW I'VE HURT YOU.
WELL, I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU,
BUT IT'S THE TRUTH.
YOU AND I, DAVID, WE'RE AN AFFAIR.
AN AFFAIR?
AN AFFAIR.
OK, I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.
WELL, I CAN'T.
I DON'T HAVE AFFAIRS.
WELL, TRY IT, YOU MIGHT LIKE IT.
YOU'RE IMPOSSIBLE.
AND YOU'RE RIDICULOUS.
I DON'T SPEND MY TIME WORRYING ABOUT
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN 6 MONTHS FROM NOW
OR HOW THIS IS GONNA SOUND IN MY MEMOIRS.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH SOMETHING THAT'S GOOD FOR RIGHT NOW?
IS THAT WHAT I AM?
JUST THE BEST THING YOU COULD FIND FOR THE MOMENT?
THAT'S A LOAD OF CRAP.
EXCUSE ME?
YOU'RE CRAZY ABOUT ME,
AND NOT FOR TONIGHT, NOT FOR NEXT WEEK,
I'M GONNA BE UNDER YOUR SKIN FOR A LONG TIME, BUSTER,
AND YOU KNOW IT!
YOU BETTER STOP BEFORE YOU EMBARRASS YOURSELF.
EMBARRASS MYSELF?
YES, EMBARRASS YOURSELF
BY MAKING ME TELL YOU THAT THE ONLY REASON I'M HERE,
THE ONLY REASON I DID ANY OF THIS WAS TO SAVE YOU!
SAVE ME?
FROM WHO?
FROM WHAT?
FROM MARRYING COMMANDER CODY OR THE LOST PLANET AIRMAN.
YOU CONCEITED,
UNDERDEVELOPED, OVER-SEXED-
LOOK, I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOU DIDN'T SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
UP ON A ROOF WITH THE 4 KIDS
LOOKING UP INTO THE NIGHT SKY
WONDERING WHEN TOM SWIFT'S GONNA MAKE IT BACK FROM JUPITER.
OH, REALLY?
YES, REALLY.
SO THIS HAS ALL BEEN ABOUT ONE BIG SELFLESS SACRIFICE ON YOUR PART?
HEY, I WAS GLAD TO DO IT-
AND NONE OF THIS HAS BEEN ABOUT
THE WAY YOU FEEL ABOUT ME.
LOOK, IS IT MY FAULT
THAT WOMEN WILL FALL FOR ANY LOAD OF PETE MOSS YOU HAND THEM
AS LONG AS YOU TELL THEM YOU LOVE THEM FIRST?
YOU'RE LYING.
NO, I'M NOT.
YES, YOU ARE.
LIAR!
NO, I AM NOT.
YES, YOU ARE!
YES, YOU ARE!
YES, YOU ARE!
MARRIAGE ENDERS, YOU PROPOSE, WE DISPOSE.
GUARANTEED TO END ANY ROMANCE IN JUST ONE NIGHT.
WHAT?
YES, YES, AGNES.
YES, THAT IS VERY WEIRD, AGNES.
ALL RIGHT, THANKS.
BETTER PUT THIS LITTLE TIFF OF OURS
ON THE BACK BURNER FOR A WHILE.
MARGARET'S FIANCEE JUST TURNED HIMSELF IN.
HE CLAIMS HE KILLED HER FATHER.
IT'S A GOOD THING WE LET 'EM STAMP OUR HANDS
LAST TIME WE LEFT.
DONE A LOT WITH THIS PLACE
SINCE THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE.
OH, MR. ADDISON.
MISS HAYES.
I, UH-
I FEEL SO ASHAMED.
I HOPE YOU'LL FORGIVE ME.
I DIDN'T WANT TO LIE.
WHY'D YOU DO IT, MS. KENDALL?
WHY'D YOU CONFESS
TO A MURDER YOU DIDN'T COMMIT?
TO PROTECT ROBERT?
I HAVE A SMALL CONFESSION TO MAKE.
I NEVER HAVE DANCED WITH A GUY.
ALTHOUGH, THAT ISN'T TO SAY THAT I WOULDN'T,
SOME OTHER TIME.
IF THE GUY WAS INTERESTED AND HE'D LET ME LEAD.
MY NAME'S DAVID ADDISON.
I'M A DETECTIVE.
YOU WANNA TELL ME ABOUT IT?
SO, UH, KENDALL CALLS ME AT THE BAR,
YOU WERE THERE.
AND HE SAYS TO ME, IF I MARRY HIS DAUGHTER
SHE GETS DROP-KICKED FROM THE WILL,
NOT THAT I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.
BUT HE TELLS ME THAT HE'S CALLED HIS LAWYER,
GOT HIM WORKIN' ON THE PAPERWORK.
SO I GO OVER THERE, TRY TO TALK HIM OUT OF IT-
LIKE I HAD A CHANCE IN HELL, RIGHT?
AND?
AND, UH, WE ARGUE.
I HIT HIM,
HE FALLS, KNOCKED UNCONSCIOUS.
I TURN ON THE GAS, BANG.
END OF STORY.
THAT'S IT?
THAT'S IT.
NO WHY?
YOU WANT A WHY?
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH SHE'S WORTH?
WHAT ABOUT LOVE?
WHAT ABOUT IT?
LOTS OF HEARTS AND FLOWERS IN OUR LAST CONVERSATION.
YOU DO LOVE HER, DON'T YOU?
LOVE HER?
LOVE WHAT SHE'S WORTH.
I RESENT THIS.
DON'T RESENT IT.
THERE'S NOTHING TO RESENT.
IT'S JUST A GOOD, INTELLIGENT WAY
TO MAKE SURE NOTHING...
TRANSPIRES.
YEAH, RIGHT.
TRANSPIRE THIS.
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY THAT.
REWIND.
FORGET THE LAST MINUTE OF YOUR LIFE.
LOOK, IF YOU'RE MORE COMFORTABLE SITTING IN THE BACK SEAT,
BY ALL MEANS, STAY IN THE BACK SEAT.
I'M JU-
IT'S LATE, THAT'S ALL.
I HAVEN'T HAD MUCH SLEEP THE PAST COUPLE OF NIGHTS.
I'M SORRY.
YOU'RE FORGIVEN.
LOVE DOESN'T COUNT FOR MUCH IN THE WORLD, DOES IT, DAVID?
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS-
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT US, I'M TALKING ABOUT THEM.
MARGARET AND ROBERT.
LOVED EACH OTHER, WANTED EACH OTHER,
SHOULD'VE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE EACH OTHER-
HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY LOVE EACH OTHER?
MAYBE THEY DO AND MAYBE THEY DON'T.
THEY SAID IT, YOU JUST SAID THEY SAID IT.
NOT 10 MINUTES AGO,
YOU WALKED OUT THE INTERROGATION ROOM,
LOOKED MARGARET IN THE EYE AND SAID-
"HE TOLD ME TO TELL YOU HE LOVES YOU VERY MUCH."
YES, I SAID THAT.
I EVER MENTION TO YOU WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL
I WAS IN THE SENIOR PLAY?
I PLAYED EMILY IN OUR TOWN.
EMILY?
THAT'S A GIRL'S PART.
YEAH, IT WAS A HELL OF A CHALLENGE.
ALL BOYS SCHOOL.
WE HAD A MOTTO IN THE THEATER DEPARTMENT.
WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH, THE TOUGH SHAVE THEIR LEGS.
IS THERE A POINT TO ALL THIS?
I'M A HELL OF AN ACTOR, MADDIE.
YOU MEAN YOU LIED TO MARGARET?
YOU TOLD HER HE LOVED HER,
AND HE DIDN'T SAY ANY SUCH THING, DID HE?
WHY WOULD YOU LIE TO HER?
WHY WOULD YOU MAKE HER CARRY A TORCH FOR SOMEONE
WHO'S GONNA SPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE ON DEATH ROW?
I DIDN'T LIE TO HER, MADDIE.
BUT YOU TOLD HER ROBERT MURPHY LOVED HER.
EXACTAMUNDO.
AND YOU JUST ADMITTED TO ME THAT HE TOLD YOU HE DIDN'T.
YEAH, A GREAT BIG DOUBLE WHOPPER WITH CHEESE, HUH, MADDIE?
DAVID-
THE BEST LINE I HEARD SINCE
"I'LL SLEEP WITH YOU, BUT I WON'T TOUCH YOU."
DAVID!
HIS LIE, MADDIE, HIS LIE, OK?
WHEN I WALKED IN THAT BAR TODAY,
HE TOLD ME HE LOVED HER.
I HEARD IT, I FELT IT, AND I BELIEVED IT.
REGARDLESS OF WHAT HE SAID DOWN IN THE STATION HOUSE.
AND YOU HAVE A THEORY TO EXPLAIN WHY HE'S LYING NOW?
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE MARGARET DID BAKE THE OLD MAN,
MAYBE ROBERT DID IT,
MAYBE IT WAS JUST AN ACCIDENT,
I DON'T KNOW.
THE ONE THING I DO KNOW IS THAT GUY LOVES THAT GIRL.
THERE'S NO DENYING THAT.
AND NOTHING, NO RULE ABOUT THE WAY LIFE OUGHT TO BE,
NO PACT, NOT THE WARSAW PACT,
NOT A WHALE PACK OF PACTS
IS GONNA MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE OR MAKE THAT OTHERWISE.
WHICH IS WHY WE ARE GOING BACK TO THE KENDALL JOINT.
EWW, MY GOODNESS.
MY FAVORITE STYLE,
WELL DONE.
LOOK AT THIS.
AND ME WITHOUT MY SACK CLOTH.
THIS IS AWFUL.
DAVID, WHY ARE WE HERE?
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?
PERHAPS I CAN HELP.
DAVID, IT'S-
THE LATE MR. KENDALL, I PRESUME.
SO WHAT'S THE STORY?
CHECK FOR THE COFFIN BOUNCE?
OR WAS THIS ONE BOOKED ROUND TRIP FROM THE START?
I HOPE YOU'LL EXCUSE THE MESS.
US?
DON'T GIVE IT A THOUGHT.
WE'RE CASUAL PEOPLE OURSELVES.
I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION THOUGH,
AND HOLLER IF WE'RE OUT OF LINE,
BUT AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD?
QUITE DEAD.
YOU HEAR THAT, MADDIE?
QUITE DEAD.
PEOPLE SAY WE DON'T HAVE GOOD PLOTS.
SO, DEAD, HUH?
YOU PROBABLY GOT A LOT OF TIME ON YOUR HANDS.
MIND IF WE ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS?
HAVE A SEAT.
LET ME HOLD YOUR HALO.
NO HALO, MR. ADDISON.
QUITE THE CONTRARY.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND, MR. KENDALL.
3 MONTHS AGO,
MY DOCTOR TOLD ME
I HAD 6 MONTHS TO LIVE.
IT SEEMS THAT IT'S TRUE WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT SMOKING.
I TOLD NO ONE.
TWO MONTHS AGO,
MARGARET MET THIS MR. MURPHY.
AS HER LOVE FOR HIM BLOSSOMED,
MY DISTRUST OF HIS INTENTIONS GREW PROPORTIONATELY.
YET NOTHING I WOULD SAY OR DO
WOULD CONVINCE HER TO LET HIM GO.
SO, KNOWING I WAS DYING ANYWAY,
I PLANNED MY OWN MURDER.
I CALLED MR. MURPHY AT THE SALOON HE'S EMPLOYED BY,
ASKED HIM TO COME OVER, TOLD HIM WE NEEDED TO TALK,
AND HE CAME.
WE FOUGHT...
LOUDLY-
FOR THE NEIGHBORS.
AND THEN HE LEFT.
AND I TURNED ON THE GAS
AND BLEW UP THIS ROOM.
MY INTENT, OF COURSE, WAS TO PIN MY MURDER ON HIM
AND GET HIM OUT OF MY DAUGHTER'S LIFE.
I EVEN INITIATED A CHANGE IN MY WILL
SO THERE WOULD APPEAR TO BE A MOTIVE.
YOU WANT US TO BELIEVE THAT YOU WERE WILLING
TO GIVE UP THE LAST 3 MONTHS OF YOUR LIFE
TO KEEP YOUR DAUGHTER FROM MARRYING THE WRONG MAN?
SHE'S MY DAUGHTER, MISS HAYES.
I LOVE HER.
WHAT ABOUT THE BODY?
THERE WAS A BODY HERE.
I OWN 13 HOSPITALS, MR. ADDISON.
I FOUND WHAT I NEEDED.
BUT MR. KENDALL, DON'T YOU SEE WHAT YOU'VE DONE?
BOTH YOUR DAUGHTER AND ROBERT MURPHY
ARE TAKING THE BLAME FOR A MURDER NEITHER ONE COMMITTED.
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A LOVE EXPRESSED SO ELOQUENTLY?
EACH THOUGHT THE OTHER GUILTY,
AND EACH STEPPED FORWARD TO SPARE THE OTHER'S LIFE.
I GUESS THAT MAKES ME A DAMN FOOL.
MISS HAYES, MR. ADDISON,
IT'S DISCONCERTING FOR A MAN TO REALIZE
THAT, UH...
HIS DEATH WAS HIS GREATEST FAILURE.
SO LITTLE OPPORTUNITY TO RECTIFY IT.
BUT, I GOT TO TRY.
I CAN'T FACE MY DAUGHTER NOW.
I COULDN'T BEAR TO FEEL THE HATE SHE'D SURELY HAVE FOR ME
IF SHE'D KNOWN WHAT I'VE DONE.
I THINK, UH...
I'M BETTER OFF DEAD.
I'VE WRITTEN A NOTE.
A SUICIDE NOTE EXPLAINING SIMPLY
THAT I COULDN'T LIVE WITH THE PAIN OF MY ILLNESS.
NOW WHAT I ASK IS THAT YOU TAKE IT TO THE POLICE.
USE IT TO FREE MR. MURPHY SO THAT HE AND MY DAUGHTER
MIGHT HAVE THE CHANCE AT HAPPINESS THEY DESERVE.
ONE MAN'S WALLET,
$7.32-
MAKE THAT 33 CENTS,
I NEED YOUR SIGNATURE, PAL.
BOY MEETS GIRL,
BOY WON'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER,
BOY GETS GIRL.
NO MATTER HOW WRONG THEY SEEMED FOR EACH OTHER.
YESSIREE, BOB, WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.
ME?
RIGHT ABOUT WHAT?
LOVE, SEX,
THE PACT,
US.
I WAS?
I AM?
I ARE?
YOU IS.
AND YOU KNOW WHEN I GOT IT?
BACK THERE IN THAT POLICE STATION
WATCHING THOSE TWO KIDS.
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S REALLY OK THAT THOSE TWO KIDS
RIDE OFF INTO THE SUNSET TOGETHER,
SPEND THE REST OF THEIR LIVES WARM AND COZY
IN SOME LITTLE BREAKFAST NOOK.
IT'S BETTER THAN OK.
IT'S RIGHT.
BUT YOU AND ME, WE'RE DIFFERENT.
OH YEAH?
HOW'S THAT?
WELL, WE'RE TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN,
WE EAT SEXUAL TENSION FOR BREAKFAST.
DRIVE ON SLY, REPARTEE, DOUBLE ENTENDRE...
BAWDY INNUENDO.
YOU TAKE AWAY THAT EDGE, YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS?
THEY MOVE US TO SUNDAY NIGHT.
7:30.
YEAH, WE LET ANIMAL MAGNETISM GET THE BEST OF US,
WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?
IT'D BE TERRIBLE, IT'D BE WRONG.
IT'D BE WORSE THAN WRONG.
IT'D BE TELECIDE.
WELL, I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I'M REALLY GLAD YOU FINALLY CAME AROUND.
IN FACT, I'M ECSTATIC, I'M ELATED, I'M GRATEFUL.
DON'T BE GRATEFUL, I'M NOT DOING THIS FOR YOU,
I'M DOING IT FOR ME, TOO.
HAVING THIS OTHER AGENDA WITH YOU
HAD ME WOUND TIGHT AS A WATCH SPRING.
NOT HAVING IT,
IF I GET ANY MORE RELAXED,
I WON'T HAVE A PULSE.
JUST ONE THING, THOUGH.
WHAT'S THAT?
NOW, DON'T TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY, BUT...
THERE IS ONE TEENSY,
TINSY, NIT-PICKY QUESTION MARK
GNAWING AT THE BASE OF MY NOGGIN.
WHAT'S THAT?
WELL, THE PAST FEW DAYS HAVE BEEN QUITE A CLAMBAKE,
AND I REALLY DIDN'T COME DRESSED FOR THE PARTY.
IS EVERYTHING...
OH!
THAT?
IS IT?
OH, YOU MEAN, IS IT SAFE?
ABSOLUTELY.
YOU SURE?
OF COURSE I'M SURE.
DAVID, I'M A GROWN WOMAN.
I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY BODY
AND WHAT I DO WITH MY BODY.
THAT'S SOMETHING I DON'T TAKE CHANCES WITH.
GOOD, THAT'S GOOD.
YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING?
NO, I DON'T MIND AT ALL.
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
IT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION.
A LITTLE IRRELEVANT KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW
AND FEELING WHAT WE FEEL.
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY THAT I'M-
GLAD WHAT HAPPENED, HAPPENED.
I'M ALSO GLAD IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN ANYMORE,
BUT I AM GLAD IT HAPPENED.
I MEAN, IT WAS PLEASURABLE,
AND I DO THINK IT'LL DEEPEN OUR FRIENDSHIP,
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
YEAH, BUT, YEAH,
I MEAN, UH, NO, IT WA-
IT WAS PLEASURABLE FOR ME, TOO, UM-
VERY PLEASURABLE,
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT I KNOW THAT YOU DO WHAT YOU DO...
DID WHAT YOU DID.
NO, I DO, I DID.
KIND OF MAKES ME WONDER HOW MUCH MORE PLEASURABLE
IT WOULD'VE BEEN HAD I KNOWN
THAT YOU DO WHAT YOU DO
WHEN WE DID WHAT WE DID, YOU KNOW?
I GUESS WE'LL NEVER KNOW.
GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.
ALTHOUGH...
IT DOES KIND OF MAKE YOU WONDER
HOW MUCH BETTER STILL OUR FRIENDSHIP WOULD BE
IF WE DID DO WHAT WE DID KNOWING THAT
YOU DO WHAT YOU DO, OR DID WHAT YOU DID, DOESN'T IT?
DAVID...
DAVID, THIS IS UNCOMFORTABLE!
HERE, LET ME GET THIS OUT OF YOUR WAY.
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT,
IT'S ABSOLUTELY-
SAFE?
ABSOLUTELY.
IT'S ABSOLUTELY...
SAFE.
OH, GOD!
I'M HIT!
AAH!

[ROOSTER CROWS]
[GROWLS]
ARE YOU ASLEEP?
NO.
ME NEITHER...
OBVIOUSLY.
SLEEP OK?
I WOULDN'T REALLY CALL IT SLEEP.
MORE LIKE A...
TOE STRAIGHTENING BREAK.
YOU SOUND LIKE YOU ENJOYED YOURSELF LAST NIGHT.
I SEEM TO RECALL YOU HITTING HIGH C YOURSELF A COUPLE TIMES.
HOW ARE WE GONNA DO THIS, DAVID?
DO WHAT?
HOW ARE WE GONNA DO THIS?
YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE, HAVEN'T YOU?
YOU TAKE A CAB HOME AND WAIT FOR ME TO CALL.
CAN'T DO THAT.
I GOT AN IDEA.
WE DO WHAT JOHN AND YOKO DID--
EVERYTHING FROM BED.
WE'LL MEET CLIENTS HERE, SOLVE CASES.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I THINK I'D LIKE YOU TO TURN THAT WAY.
WHAT FOR?
I WANT TO TAKE A SHOWER.
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO LOOK AT YOU?
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING TO BE SHY ABOUT.
GUESS I'LL HAVE TO FEND FOR MYSELF.
HEY!
HO!
HEY!
SORRY.
YO!
SHOULD I PUT SOME COFFEE ON?
I DON'T HAVE TIME.
I HAVE TO RUN RIGHT OUT.
ANY CHANCE OF YOU DROPPING ME BY MY PLACE?
YOUR PLACE?
CAN'T YOU TAKE A CAB?
A CAB?
FORGET ABOUT IT.
I'LL JUST CALL MY PIMP.
HE'LL PICK ME UP ON THE CORNER.
I DIDN'T MEAN IT THAT WAY, DAVID.
I JUST REMEMBERED I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT.
IF I TAKE YOU HOME, I'LL BE LATE.
YEAH...
WELL, FORGET ABOUT IT.
NO PROBLEM.
GOOD MORNING, MISS DIPESTO.
MORNING, MISS HAYES.
MISS HAYES...
YES?
OH...
WHAT IS IT, MISS DIPESTO?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS,
BUT YOU LOOK GREAT TODAY.
NO, I DON'T.
I'LL BE IN MY OFFICE.
YES, MISS HAYES.
SORRY ABOUT THE...
COMPLIMENT.
* WOKE UP THIS MORNING MY HEAD WAS SO BAD *
* IT WAS THE WORST HANGOVER THAT I EVER DID HAVE *
WHAT'S UP, BOYS?
* IT WAS NO WINE I HAD ME TOO MUCH OF *
* IT WAS A DOUBLE SHOT OF MY BABY'S LOVE *
* YEAH, YEAH...*
Maddie:
DAVID?
DAVID!
COULD I HAVE A MINUTE OF YOUR TIME, PLEASE?
TAKE TWO, THEY'RE SMALL.
[SINGING]
WHAT WERE YOU DOING OUT THERE JUST NOW?
PRETENDING LIKE I JUST GOT TO WORK.
YOU WERE SINGING.
SO?
SO, HOW'S IT SUPPOSED TO LOOK TO THOSE PEOPLE
WHEN YOU COME IN HERE SINGING?
SAME WAY IT LOOKS EVERY OTHER DAY
WHEN I COME IN HERE SINGING.
BUT IT'S NOT EVERY OTHER DAY.
IT'S THE DAY AFTER LAST NIGHT.
THEY DON'T KNOW THAT.
AND I WANT TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.
IT'S GONNA BE HARD TO DO THAT
IF YOU DON'T STOP ACTING SO DAMN HAPPY.
HA!
SO DAMN HAPPY?
I'M NOT ACTING ALL THAT DAMN HAPPY.
I'M JUST...
ACTING HAPPY.
AREN'T YOU HAPPY?
OF COURSE I'M HAPPY.
ARE YOU SURE?
I SAID I WAS HAPPY, DAVID.
I AM HAPPY!
DON'T TELL ME I'M NOT HAPPY WHEN I'M HAPPY.
WELL GREAT!
YOU'RE HAPPY, I'M HAPPY,
WE'RE ALL SLAP HAPPY.
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE I'M NOT ALL THAT HAPPY.
IT'S NOT THAT I'M NOT HAPPY.
IT'S JUST THAT I'M NOT HAPPY.
I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL.
TAKE IT FROM ME, YOU FEEL GREAT.
DON'T--DON'T DO THAT.
DON'T DO WHAT?
DON'T SAY THINGS LIKE THAT IN THE OFFICE.
BUT I ALWAYS SAY THINGS LIKE THAT IN THE OFFICE.
IT'S WHAT I DO.
LOOK, I AGREE.
MAYBE WE SHOULD WAIT A LITTLE WHILE
BEFORE WE SPRING IT ON THE EMPLOYEES.
WE'RE NOT SPRINGING ANYTHING ON THE EMPLOYEES.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IF THEY KNEW, THEY'D THINK WE'D BE ROCKING THE DESK
EVERY TIME WE'RE ALONE IN HERE.
DOES THE LOCK ON YOUR DOOR WORK?
STOP IT.
STOP WHAT?
STOP TALKING LIKE THAT.
STOP THINKING LIKE THAT.
I HATE THIS, DAVID.
I HATE FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE
AND WONDERING WHAT THE EMPLOYEES MIGHT BE THINKING
AND CRINGING EVERY TIME YOU MAKE A SUGGESTIVE REMARK.
SO DON'T DO IT.
THANK YOU.
AS USUAL, THE DEPTH OF YOUR SENSITIVITY IS STAGGERING.
COME ON, MADDIE.
LOOK, I KNOW YOU FEEL A LITTLE WEIRD,
I FEEL A LITTLE WEIRD MYSELF.
BUT IT'S A GOOD WEIRD.
SO WHAT IF IT TAKES A LITTLE TIME?
WE'LL WORK IT OUT.
I DON'T WANNA WORK IT OUT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I MEAN I DON'T WANNA WORK IT ALL OUT.
I WANT TO FORGET IT.
WHAT?
DAVID, LAST NIGHT WAS A MISTAKE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
I GOT ALL CAUGHT UP IN THE MOMENT,
AND EVERYTHING HAPPENED BEFORE I HAD TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT.
OK.
OK, I'LL BUY THAT.
YOU LOST YOUR HEAD,
NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR ACTIONS.
I'LL BUY THAT...
THE FIRST TIME.
BUT THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN THE SECOND TIME.
WELL, THE SECOND TIME I COULDN'T THINK STRAIGHT
BECAUSE I WAS STILL SHOCKED FROM THE FIRST TIME.
REALLY?
WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE THIRD TIME?
THIRD TIME?
WHAT THIRD TIME?
COME TO THINK OF IT, YOU WERE PRETTY QUIET.
I FIGURED YOU WERE JUST WORRIED ABOUT WAKING THE NEIGHBORS.
DAVID, STOP THIS!
I CAN'T DO THIS, I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS,
I CAN'T WORK LIKE THIS.
I CAN'T!
LET'S MAKE A PACT.
A WHAT?
A PACT THAT LAST NIGHT NEVER HAPPENED.
WHAT FOR?
BECAUSE IT NEVER SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED.
IT WASN'T MEANT TO HAPPEN.
IT MAKES EVERYTHING WRONG.
DAVID, THE TWO OF US ARE THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE THAT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
IF WE AGREE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN, THEN IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.
BUT IT DID.
BUT WE'LL MAKE A PACT THAT IT DIDN'T.
NO, IT DID.
AND I LIKE THAT IT DID.
AND I GOT A HOT NEWS FLASH FOR YOU, BABE,
SO DID YOU.
YES, I DID.
DID, DAVID.
PAST TENSE.
BUT NOT ANYMORE.
NOT NOW.
NOW I FEEL TERRIBLE.
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS PACT.
PACT, SCHMACT.
IT HAPPENED.
WE DID IT.
IT'S DONE.
WELL DONE, I MIGHT ADD,
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE NO PACT.
OF COURSE THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.
WHAT YOU WANT.
DAVID, DO YOU EVEN REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO ME LAST NIGHT?
YES, I REMEMBER WHAT I SAID LAST NIGHT.
I MEANT IT.
WELL, IF YOU REALLY MEANT IT,
YOU'LL MAKE THIS PACT.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
COME IN.
THERE'S A WOMAN HERE TO SEE YOU.
I CAN TELL HER TO COME BACK IF IT'S A BAD TIME.
NO, NO.
IT'S A FINE TIME.
SEND HER IN.
I'M SORRY TO SHOW UP WITHOUT AN APPOINTMENT.
OH, IT'S A PERFECT TIME.
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT MISS...
KENDALL...
MARGARET.
HOW MAY WE HELP YOU, MISS KENDALL?
AN AMAZING THING HAS HAPPENED.
I'VE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH A WONDERFUL MAN.
AND HE'S FALLEN IN LOVE WITH ME.
I NEVER DREAMED THAT ANYTHING LIKE THIS COULD HAPPEN.
I'VE NEVER BEEN VERY, UM,
ADEPT AT ATTRACTING MEN'S ATTENTION.
I MEAN, I'M NOT VERY PRETTY,
AND ON TOP OF THAT, I'M RATHER SHY.
SO, UM, I GUESS I'D ACCEPTED
THAT I WOULD SPEND MY LIFE IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE,
UM, TRY TO BE HAPPY IN OTHER PEOPLE'S ROMANCES...
AND THEN, ONE NIGHT...
I MET THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MAN.
TO MY SURPRISE, HE CAME TO SEE ME THE NEXT DAY...
AND THE NEXT,
AND WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER EVER SINCE.
AND THE AMAZING THING IS HOW EASY
AND NATURAL IT ALL WAS RIGHT FROM THE START.
HE'S ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM.
CONGRATULATIONS.
IT'S THE BEST PROBLEM I'VE HEARD ALL WEEK.
WELL, MY FATHER, HE, UM, HE THINKS, UM...
WELL, YOU SEE, MY FATHER'S VERY WEALTHY.
HE'S A DOCTOR.
HE WORKS AT SAINT MATTHEWS MEDICAL CENTER.
ACTUALLY, HE OWNS IT.
OWNS IT?
YES...
ACTUALLY, HE OWNS SEVERAL HOSPITALS... 13.
FATHER'S WORKED VERY HARD ALL HIS LIFE
AND HE LIKES PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD, TOO.
ANYWAY, I GUESS I'M VERY WEALTHY.
I GUESS THAT'S HIS CONCERN.
I THINK HE THINKS THAT'S WHY ROBERT WANTS TO MARRY ME.
FATHER'S VERY PROTECTIVE.
MY, UM, MY MOTHER DIED A LONG TIME AGO,
AND I'M HIS ONLY CHILD,
AND HE DOESN'T WANT ME TO MARRY, UH...
INAPPROPRIATELY.
ROBERT'S A BARTENDER.
IT'S A FREE COUNTRY, MISS KENDALL.
YOU'RE OVER 18.
NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I'VE NEVER CONTRADICTED MY FATHER.
I COULDN'T DO THAT.
BESIDES, HE'S JUST TRYING TO PROTECT ME.
WELL, THE THING IS, I THINK IF MY FATHER HAD
SOME SORT OF OBJECTIVE PROOF THAT ROBERT LOVES ME,
THEN HE WOULD AGREE TO THE MARRIAGE.
OBJECTIVE PROOF?
THAT'S WHY I WANT TO HIRE YOU.
I WANT YOU TO PROVE THAT ROBERT LOVES ME.
UH-HUH.
AND HOW LONG HAS HE WORKED THERE?
NO, THAT SHOULD DO IT, IT'S A SMALL LOAN.
WE'RE JUST CONFIRMING THE APPLICATION.
THANK YOU.
YOU'VE BEEN VERY HELPFUL.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
THOUGHT I HEARD A KNOCK.
MIND IF I COME IN?
MIND?
NOT AT ALL, PARTNER.
COME ON IN.
MADE A FEW CALLS ABOUT ROBERT MURPHY.
DID SOME CHECKING UP.
DO TELL.
THOUGHT WE COULD COMPARE NOTES.
GREAT IDEA,
IF I HAD ANY NOTES TO COMPARE.
TRUTH IS--
I'VE BEEN ONE WITH THIS CHAIR
FOR THE BETTER PART OF THE MORN.
I TRIED TO WORK UP THE STEAM TO GO OUT AND SNOOP AROUND,
BUT DID YOU EVER HAVE ONE OF THOSE DAYS
WHERE EVERYTHING FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE CATCHES UP WITH YOU?
NOT THAT I WENT ANYWHERE, OR SAW ANYONE.
IN FACT...
THERE'S NOT A SOUL THAT CAN SAY I WASN'T
EXACTLY WHERE I SAID I WAS.
THE OLD HOMESTEAD,
ALL BY MY LONESOME,
FILLING THE SALT SHAKERS,
RE-GROUTING MY TILE,
DISCOVERING THE REAL REASON CLEANING WOMEN DON'T DO WINDOWS.
WHAT DID YOU DO LAST NIGHT, PARTNER?
ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SHARE WITH THE CLASS?
MAYBE I SHOULD COME BACK LATER.
NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT.
YOU'VE BEEN KEEPING YOUR NOSE,
OR ANYTHING ELSE, TO THE GRINDSTONE
TO DIG UP SOME DIRT,
LET'S HEAR WHAT YOU GOT.
DAVID...
LET'S HEAR WHAT YOU GOT.
FINE.
HERE'S WHAT I GOT.
ROBERT MURPHY:
TWICE DIVORCED,
EACH MARRIAGE LASTING LESS THAN A YEAR,
NEVER FINISHED COLLEGE, HE'S HELD A COUPLE OF JOBS SINCE THEN,
BARTENDER SHOWS UP A FEW TIMES ON HIS RESUME.
THAT'S WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING SINCE DECEMBER
AT A PLACE CALLED GEORGE AND HARRY'S BAR.
BEFORE THAT HE WAS UNEMPLOYED FOR ALMOST 6 MONTHS.
NO HISTORY OF BAD CHECKS, BUT HIS CREDIT CARDS ARE AT THE LIMIT.
I HAVE SOME OTHER CALLS OUT.
I SHOULD HAVE SOME MORE FACTS BY THIS AFTERNOON.
MORE FACTS?
IT'S QUITE A MOUTHFUL YOU HAVE THERE, ISN'T IT?
I DON'T KNOW.
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
ABOUT WHAT?
ABOUT THE IRISHMAN MARRYING INTO CLOVER.
I DON'T THINK ANYTHING YET.
ALL THOSE FACTS AND NOTHING TO GO ON?
WELL, IT'S A PLACE TO START.
HA HA HA.
START?
YOU'RE OUT OF THE BLOCKS,
NEARING THE TAPE, THE CROWD'S ON ITS FEET,
YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO CROSS THE FINISH LINE.
OK.
YOU TELL ME, WHAT SHOULD I THINK?
THOSE FACT OF YOURS PAINT QUITE A PICTURE.
LIKE WHAT?
THE CAT AND THE GILDED CANARY?
THE BLOODSUCKER GETTING THE BLOOD BANK?
THE HAVE-NOTS TAKING THE HAVE
FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE, BUT ESPECIALLY FOR BETTER?
TWO PEOPLE WITH ONE THING IN COMMON,
AND IT SURE AIN'T LOVE?
YOU COULD SAY THAT.
SURE AS HELL COULD.
I TAKE IT THAT'S YOUR OPINION.
MY OPINION?
NO.
MY OPINION SAYS THAT YOUR FACTS DON'T MEAN A DAMN THING
WHEN IT GETS DOWN TO THE YING AND YANG
OF WHY TWO PEOPLE WANT TO BE TOGETHER.
YOU TAKE YOUR ROMEO AND JULIET--
NOW HERE'S A COUPLE KIDS WHO WANTED TO BE TOGETHER.
TRIPPED OVER A FEW FACTS ON THE WAY TO THE ALTAR,
WOUND UP IN A MAUSOLEUM BUILT FOR TWO,
WHICH, I GUESS IS MY WAY OF SAYING
THAT I'LL COAST OVER TO GEORGE AND HARRY'S,
QUAFF A FEW COLD ONES WITH MR. MURPHY,
AND GET THE REAL SKINNY.
WHICH COMES FROM A REGION JUST SOUTH OF THE BRAIN.
WHEN I COME BACK, WE'LL COMPARE FACTS.
OH, MR. ADDISON?
THIS IS MR...
KENDALL.
OH, MISS HAYES?
THIS IS MR. KENDALL.
MR. KENDALL?
THE FATHER...
OF THE BRIDE.
OH, OF COURSE.
WON'T YOU COME IN?
HAVE A SEAT, MR. KENDALL.
I LIKE TO STAND, THANK YOU.
HOW CAN WE HELP YOU?
I BELIEVE MY DAUGHTER HAS HIRED YOU
TO INVESTIGATE THE MAN SHE INTENDS TO MARRY.
MR. KENDALL, I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER,
BUT WE CAN'T DISCUSS OUR CLIENTS WITH YOU OR ANYONE ELSE.
ALL CASES ARE CONFIDENTIAL.
OF COURSE THEY ARE.
I ADMIRE YOUR PROFESSIONALISM.
AND IN THAT SPIRIT,
I'D LIKE TO HIRE YOU MYSELF.
HIRE US.
FOR WHAT?
TO LOOK INTO MR. MURPHY'S PAST.
TO FIND WHAT YOU CAN ABOUT HIS WORK HABITS,
RELIABILITY, AND HIS DEALINGS WITH OTHER WOMEN...
MR. KENDALL, IT WON'T BE NECESSARY TO...
HIRE YOU FOR A JOB YOU'RE ALREADY DOING.
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE, MISS HAYES.
I INTEND TO ENSURE THE OUTCOME.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
ON THE OFF-CHANCE THAT YOUR INVESTIGATION
LACKS THE FUNDING IT MAY REQUIRE,
I THOUGHT PERHAPS $10,000 MIGHT FACILITATE YOUR EFFORTS
TO TURN UP ADEQUATE EVIDENCE.
YOU'RE BRIBING US TO FALSIFY OUR INVESTIGATIONS
TO TURN YOUR DAUGHTER AGAINST HER FIANCEE?
IN A NUTSHELL.
YOU'LL HAVE TO LEAVE, MR. KENDALL.
HEAR ME OUT, MISS HAYES.
I HAVE TO DO THIS.
FOR MY DAUGHTER.
MARGARET...
IS SPONTANEOUS.
SHE'S RULED BY HER EMOTIONS,
SHE PAYS LITTLE,
IF ANY, ATTENTION TO LIFE'S WARNING SIGNS.
AND AS SUCH, SHE HAS ALMOST NO SENSE
OF THE PRACTICAL EFFECT OF HER DECISIONS.
IN PLAIN TRUTH...
I DON'T BELIEVE SHE'LL BE DISSUADED BY THE FACTS.
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, MR. KENDALL,
THAT SHE SEEMS TO BE VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH HIM.
I SUPPOSE...
IF I WERE A YOUNG WOMAN,
A FAIRLY PLAIN, YOUNG WOMAN,
NEVER HAVING BEEN SOUGHT AFTER,
I MIGHT LOVE HIM, TOO.
HE'S HANDSOME.
HE'S CHARMING.
HE MAKES HER HAPPY.
THAT'S IMPORTANT.
LIFE ISN'T OFTEN ABOUT HAPPINESS, MISS HAYES.
IT'S ABOUT REALITIES.
CONTROL THE REALITIES,
AND THEN, MAYBE,
YOU CAN TRY FOR THE REST.
AND THE REALITY HERE IS THAT ROBERT MURPHY WANTS ONE THING
AND ONE THING ONLY--
MY MONEY!
I'M SORRY, MR. KENDALL.
I HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO OUR CLIENT.
THEN OUR BUSINESS IS FINISHED.
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR A NICE, TALL, COLD ONE.
DIDN'T YOU USED TO WORK AT SALOON'S?
NOPE.
MAN, I COULD SWEAR I'VE SEEN YOU SOMEWHERE.
BLUE ONION?
DID YOU USED TO WORK THERE?
I USED TO GO IN THERE ALL THE TIME.
YEAH, I DID A HITCH OVER THERE.
MURPH, RIGHT?
THAT'S RIGHT.
DAVE.
HI, DAVE.
IRISH, NEAT, WATER BACK.
SORRY, I FORGOT.
OH, DOESN'T MATTER.
I HAVEN'T BEEN TO THE BLUE ONION
FOR A LONG TIME.
THAT'S JOINT'S A REAL MEAT MARKET, ISN'T IT?
YEAH, IT USED TO BE.
I HEAR IT'S CALMED DOWN A LOT.
I USED TO SLIDE IN THERE ON FRIDAY NIGHTS,
WALL TO WALL BODIES.
GRADE A, PRIME CUT,
I MEAN I THOUGHT I DIED AND WENT TO HEAVEN.
I IMAGINE YOU MUST HAVE A FEW COCKTAIL NAPKINS
WITH SOME PRETTY INTERESTING NUMBERS ON THEM?
IT'S NOT MY LOCAL.
THAT'S WHY I LEFT.
COULDN'T KEEP YOUR MIND OFF THE CLIENTELE, HUH?
LOOK, DON'T GET ME WRONG,
I DON'T HAVE A PREJUDICED BONE IN MY BODY,
AND THEY'RE THE NICEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, GREAT TIPPERS, TOO,
WHICH IS WHY I STAYED AFTER THE MANAGEMENT CHANGED,
BUT I COULD NEVER GET USED
TO WATCHING YOU GUYS DANCE WITH EACH OTHER.
YEAH.
WELL, THAT DOES TAKE SOME GETTING USED TO,
DOESN'T IT?
YEAH, I MEAN, IT'S A LUSH LIFE, MAN,
WHATEVER GETS YOU THROUGH THE NIGHT.
Woman:
SEE YOU LATER, MURPH.
SHEILA, SEE YOU LATER.
HERE'S TO WOMEN.
EACH AND EVERY LONG LEGGED ONE OF 'EM.
HOW DOES THE GOOD LORD EXPECT YOU TO PICK ONLY ONE
WHEN THERE'S SO MANY TO CHOOSE FROM?
I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID
FOR WAITING FOR THE RIGHT PERSON TO COME ALONG.
SPOKEN LIKE A MAN WHO DID...
OR HAS.
YEAH, COULD BE.
PERFECT WOMAN, HUH?
22, TALL,
INTELLIGENT BUT NOT BOOKISH,
KNOCKED OUT BODY,
AND A BIG FAT JUICY TRUST FUND TO MATCH.
NONE OF THAT MATTERS, BELIEVE ME.
I'VE BEEN WITH A LOT OF WOMEN.
I'VE PARTIED WITH THEM,
I'VE LIVED WITH THEM,
AND I EVEN MARRIED A COUPLE OF 'EM.
BUT NOT ONE'S EVER BEEN A FRIEND.
'TILL NOW.
WHAT IS THIS, A SURVEY?
SO...
WHERE DID YOU MEET THIS JEWEL
IN THE CROWN OF WOMANHOOD?
TRAFFIC SCHOOL.
HA HA.
IT WAS ON A COFFEE BREAK.
SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY CHANGE, SO I SPOTTED HER A CRUELLER.
AND THEN I CAME BACK THE NEXT NIGHT,
EVEN THOUGH I GRADUATED THE NIGHT BEFORE...
JUST TO TALK TO HER.
GONNA MAKE AN HONEST WOMAN OUT OF HER?
YOU'RE AN INQUISITIVE ONE.
COME ON, IT JUST...
SOUNDS LIKE LOVE.
THAT'S ALL.
BOY MEETS GIRL, FALL IN LOVE,
THEY USUALLY GET MARRIED.
AT LEAST, THAT'S THE WAY I HEAR.
WELL, WE'VE GOT SOME PROBLEMS TO IRON OUT.
SHE GOT COLD FEET?
REAL COLD.
OH, NOT ABOUT MARRYING ME.
NO, IT'S, UH...
IT'S HER FAMILY.
I MEAN, IT'S THE KIND OF FAMILY
THAT HAS LIBRARIES NAMED AFTER 'EM.
PLUS MY FOLKS...
I TOOK HER HOME AND MY OLD MAN
PUT ON HIS BEST UNDERSHIRT JUST FOR THE OCCASION.
ANYWAY, IT'S A PROBLEM.
WE'LL GET PAST IT.
SEE, I JUST DON'T WANT HER TO THINK
THAT ME AND HER ARE SOME KIND OF ACCIDENT...
SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED.
[TELEPHONE RINGS]
EXCUSE ME.
GEORGE AND HARRY'S.
LOOK, I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.
ALL RIGHT.
BYE-BYE.
HEY, SMITTY, COVER FOR ME, WOULD YA?
I GOTTA SPLIT.
Smitty:
SURE, NO PROBLEM.
YOU'RE A GOOD LISTENER, MAN.
YOU OUGHT TO BE A BARTENDER.
THANKS.
GOOD NIGHT, MR. ADDISON.
GOOD NIGHT, MR. ADDISON.
GOOD NIGHT.
'NIGHT, BOSS.
MR. ADDISON, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE BACK.
HERE'S SOME MORE BACKGROUND INFO ON THE KENDALL CASE.
MISS HAYES AROUND?
SHE WENT HOME EARLY.
SAID SHE DIDN'T GET MUCH SLEEP LAST...
NIGHT.
HER NEIGHBOR'S POMERANIAN KEPT HER UP.
YIP, YIP, YIP ALL NIGHT LONG.
MAYBE SAM SNORES.
SAM'S GONE.
HE IS?
THAT'S TERRIFIC.
ISN'T IT?
YEAH, IT'S TERRIFIC.
SO, I GUESS THINGS WILL GO BACK TO NORMAL
BETWEEN YOU AND MISS HAYES.
YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS WITH THIS CASE?
THESE PEOPLE WANT TO BE TOGETHER.
THESE PEOPLE SHOULD BE TOGETHER.
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
YOU'RE RIGHT, MISS DIPESTO.
THERE IS NO PROBLEM.
OH...
WELL, 'NIGHT, MR. ADDISON.
YES, MARGARET KENDALL, PLEASE.
WHAT?
FATHER WAS IN THE GUEST COTTAGE,
READING, LIKE HE DOES EVERY NIGHT,
AND I CAME HOME FROM THE STABLES THE SAME TIME AS EVERY NIGHT.
AND I WENT OUT TO SAY HELLO TO HIM AND...
ROBERT CAME UP IN THE CONVERSATION LIKE HE DOES EVERY NIGHT.
I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU WHAT FATHER SAID THAT WAS ANY DIFFERENT,
ANY WORSE THAN BEFORE.
I JUST, UM...
LASHED OUT, MR. ADDISON.
I HIT HIM.
THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY TIMES I'VE WANTED TO,
AND THIS TIME...
HE FELL AND HIT HIS HEAD.
HE WAS JUST LYING THERE, UNCONSCIOUS.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAME OVER ME.
I HARDLY EVEN REMEMBER DOING IT,
BUT I DID.
I JUST...
TURNED THE GAS ON, ON THE OVEN,
AND WALKED OUT THE DOOR.
I WAS IN THE HOUSE WHEN I HEARD IT.
I DON'T REMEMBER WHERE, EXACTLY, OR WHAT I WAS DOING,
BUT IT WAS QUITE AN EXPLOSION.
SHE DONE DOOD IT.
SHE DID?
DOOD?
DAMN!
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO COME DOWN HERE YOU KNOW.
I COULD HAVE TAKEN A CAB.
DON'T BE STUPID, DAVID.
YOU CALLED, I CAME.
I CALLED TO TELL YOU WHAT WAS GOING ON.
NOT TO GET YOU OUT HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
DAVID, I CAME DOWN HERE BECAUSE I WANTED TO COME DOWN HERE.
I THOUGHT MISS KENDALL MIGHT NEED MY HELP.
SHE'S MY CLIENT, TOO.
OK.
LONG AS THAT'S WHY YOU CAME.
THAT'S WHY I CAME.
YOU'RE COMFORTABLE, I'M COMFORTABLE.
I'M VERY COMFORTABLE.
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK
I WAS TRYING TO GET YOU OUT HERE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
I MEAN, GIVEN WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MIDDLE OF LAST NIGHT,
AND HOW YOU FELT ABOUT IT THIS MORNING.
I MEAN, PERSONALLY, I DON'T FEEL THAT WAY,
BUT I KNOW YOU DO,
SO, I JUST DIDN'T WANT YOU TO THINK
THAT I WAS PULLING SOMETHING.
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE PULLING SOMETHING.
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE PULLING ANYTHING.
NOT THAT I'D MIND PULLING SOMETHING.
QUIT WHILE YOU'RE AHEAD.
WE'RE HERE.
WELL...
WELL.
DAVID, DON'T THINK I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT?
DON'T THINK I DON'T KNOW
HOW UNFAIR THIS ALL SEEMS TO YOU.
MY POINT OF VIEW
OF EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED--
THE PACT, ALL OF IT--
I DO KNOW.
BUT I ALSO FEEL THAT IT'S RIGHT.
WE'VE DONE THE RIGHT THING.
WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING.
AND I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE
YOUR RESPECT FOR MY FEELINGS.
YEAH, WELL.
AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROOF OF THIS IS?
THE PROOF THAT ALL OF THIS,
THE PACT, OUR BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP,
OUR FRIENDSHIP WILL WORK,
THE PROOF OF IT IS THAT HERE WE ARE,
IT'S 2:30 IN THE MORNING,
WE'RE SITTING IN A CAR, BY OURSELVES,
ALL ALONE ON A DARK STREET,
AND WHAT ARE WE DOING?
WE'RE TALKING.
WE'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION,
AND THAT'S ALL WE'RE DOING.
I LIKE THIS, DAVID.
IT MAKES ME FEEL COMFORTABLE.
I APPRECIATE THIS, AND I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT.
WELL, OK.
GOOD.
I HAVE TO BE--
LOOK, I GOTTA BE HONEST WITH YOU.
I'M NOT HAVING AN EASY TIME WITH THIS.
I KNOW.
I MEAN, I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,
AND I KNOW YOU MEAN IT,
AND I KNOW THAT IT MAKES YOU FEEL...
COMFORTABLE.
YES, IT DOES.
I'M JUST NOT QUITE THERE YET.
IT TAKES TIME.
THERE'S A BIG PART OF ME THAT CAN'T HELP
WANTING TO FIND THAT SPOT ON YOUR NECK.
IT'S VERY UNDERSTANDABLE--
WHAT SPOT ON MY NECK?
YOU KNOW THAT LITTLE SPOT ON THE BACK OF YOUR NECK
JUST BELOW YOUR HAIRLINE?
OH, YEAH.
THERE.
KIND OF...
BRUSH MY LIPS AGAINST IT.
NOT HARD OR ANYTHING.
NO, NO, I UNDERSTAND.
AND MAYBE UNBUTTON YOUR BLOUSE.
DAVID...
BUTTON BY BUTTON.
OHH...
I THINK THIS CONVERSATION'S TAKING A TURN.
THEN MAYBE...
SOME LITTLE BABY KISSES DOWN YOUR SPINE.
THIS IS HARD FOR YOU.
YEAH.
WHICH UNDERSCORES MY POINT AND MY APPRECIATION.
THEN, I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE...
SOME LITTLE ANGEL KISSES ON YOUR BELLY.
MMM, WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE THE PACT.
WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE THE PACT.
WELL...
WELL...
DAVID!
DAVID!
DAVID!
I THINK WE NEED A NEW PACT.
WHAT?
A NEW PACT.
I THINK WE NEED ONE.
WHAT WE JUST DID INVALIDATES THE OLD ONE.
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT?
I'M JUST SAYING THAT BEFORE THIS GOES ANY FURTHER,
NOW WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO PUT A STOP TO THIS.
MAKE A NEW PACT...
I HATE THIS PACT CRAP.
I'M NOT DOING THIS TO HURT YOU, I'M DOING THIS--
BECAUSE YOU'RE NUTS.
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE DOING THIS.
THAT'S NOT A PRODUCTIVE THING TO SAY, AFTER WE JUST MADE LOVE,
JUST BEFORE WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A NEW PACT.
I JUST FIGURED IT OUT.
FIGURED WHAT OUT?
WHY YOU'RE 36 YEARS OLD AND STILL BY YOURSELF.
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
WHAT IS WITH THE PACT CRAP?
IT'S NOT CRAP!
YES, IT IS!
IT ISN'T!
YES, IT IS!
IT'S NOT!
IT'S JUST A WAY FOR ME TO...
TO WHAT?
TO MAKE SENSE!
OF WHAT?
OF THIS!
OF WHAT?
OF US!
DAVID, I DIDN'T PLAN THIS--I UNPLANNED THIS.
I SPENT ALL DAY TODAY SWEARING TO MYSELF THIS WOULDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN,
THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.
NOT WITH YOU.
NOT EVER.
AND HERE WE ARE.
WHY DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING?
THE SAME REASON CHRISTMAS KEEPS HAPPENING.
BECAUSE IT'S TERRIFIC, THAT'S WHY.
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING'S TERRIFIC
DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE TO LIKE IT!
YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT?
FINE!
JUST BECAUSE I LIKE SOMETHING...
UGH!
TO HELL WITH YOU, DAVID.
THIS IS NOT THE WAY I LIVE MY LIFE.
I DON'T JUST GIVE MYSELF TO PEOPLE.
I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT, CONSIDER, CONTEMPLATE.
AND WHEN I DO, IF I DO,
WELL, IT ISN'T LIKE THIS--
ALL WILD AND FRENZIED.
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS PLACE.
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY LIGHTS, YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FURNITURE,
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THESE SHEETS WERE CHANGED?
CAN'T WE JUST TALK ABOUT HOW TERRIFIC IT IS FOR A MINUTE?
I'M SORRY.
I JUST DON'T FEEL RIGHT ABOUT IT.
WHY DO YOU KEEP SAYING THAT?
WHY ARE YOU SO UPSET?
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS GET THE SHEET?
[WATER RUNNING]
HEY.
HEY.
IS THIS ABOUT WORK?
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?
'CAUSE IF IT IS,
IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL ANY BETTER,
I'LL FIND A JOB SOMEWHERE ELSE.
IT'S NOT THAT.
WELL, THEN WHAT IS IT?
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, DAVID.
WE DON'T MAKE SENSE.
YOU'RE NOT WHO I'M SUPPOSED TO BE WITH.
I SEE.
WELL...
I'M SORRY, BUT I JUST DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY.
WELL, OF COURSE YOU DON'T SEE IT LIKE THAT.
I'M EXACTLY WHO YOU WANT TO BE WITH.
OH, GREAT.
NOW I'VE HURT YOU.
WELL, I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU,
BUT IT'S THE TRUTH.
YOU AND I, DAVID, WE'RE AN AFFAIR.
AN AFFAIR?
AN AFFAIR.
OK, I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.
WELL, I CAN'T.
I DON'T HAVE AFFAIRS.
WELL, TRY IT, YOU MIGHT LIKE IT.
YOU'RE IMPOSSIBLE.
AND YOU'RE RIDICULOUS.
I DON'T SPEND MY TIME WORRYING ABOUT
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN 6 MONTHS FROM NOW
OR HOW THIS IS GONNA SOUND IN MY MEMOIRS.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH SOMETHING THAT'S GOOD FOR RIGHT NOW?
IS THAT WHAT I AM?
JUST THE BEST THING YOU COULD FIND FOR THE MOMENT?
THAT'S A LOAD OF CRAP.
EXCUSE ME?
YOU'RE CRAZY ABOUT ME,
AND NOT FOR TONIGHT, NOT FOR NEXT WEEK,
I'M GONNA BE UNDER YOUR SKIN FOR A LONG TIME, BUSTER,
AND YOU KNOW IT!
YOU BETTER STOP BEFORE YOU EMBARRASS YOURSELF.
EMBARRASS MYSELF?
YES, EMBARRASS YOURSELF
BY MAKING ME TELL YOU THAT THE ONLY REASON I'M HERE,
THE ONLY REASON I DID ANY OF THIS WAS TO SAVE YOU!
SAVE ME?
FROM WHO?
FROM WHAT?
FROM MARRYING COMMANDER CODY OR THE LOST PLANET AIRMAN.
YOU CONCEITED,
UNDERDEVELOPED, OVER-SEXED--
LOOK, I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOU DIDN'T SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
UP ON A ROOF WITH THE 4 KIDS
LOOKING UP INTO THE NIGHT SKY
WONDERING WHEN TOM SWIFT'S GONNA MAKE IT BACK FROM JUPITER.
OH, REALLY?
YES, REALLY.
SO THIS HAS ALL BEEN ABOUT ONE BIG SELFLESS SACRIFICE ON YOUR PART?
HEY, I WAS GLAD TO DO IT--
AND NONE OF THIS HAS BEEN ABOUT
THE WAY YOU FEEL ABOUT ME.
LOOK, IS IT MY FAULT
THAT WOMEN WILL FALL FOR ANY LOAD OF PETE MOSS YOU HAND THEM
AS LONG AS YOU TELL THEM YOU LOVE THEM FIRST?
YOU'RE LYING.
NO, I'M NOT.
YES, YOU ARE.
LIAR!
NO, I AM NOT.
YES, YOU ARE!
YES, YOU ARE!
YES, YOU ARE!
[TELEPHONE RINGS]
[RING]
MARRIAGE ENDERS, YOU PROPOSE, WE DISPOSE.
GUARANTEED TO END ANY ROMANCE IN JUST ONE NIGHT.
WHAT?
YES, YES, AGNES.
YES, THAT IS VERY WEIRD, AGNES.
ALL RIGHT, THANKS.
BETTER PUT THIS LITTLE TIFF OF OURS
ON THE BACK BURNER FOR A WHILE.
MARGARET'S FIANCEE JUST TURNED HIMSELF IN.
HE CLAIMS HE KILLED HER FATHER.
IT'S A GOOD THING WE LET 'EM STAMP OUR HANDS
LAST TIME WE LEFT.
DONE A LOT WITH THIS PLACE
SINCE THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE.
OH, MR. ADDISON.
MISS HAYES.
I, UH--
I FEEL SO ASHAMED.
I HOPE YOU'LL FORGIVE ME.
I DIDN'T WANT TO LIE.
WHY'D YOU DO IT, MS. KENDALL?
WHY'D YOU CONFESS
TO A MURDER YOU DIDN'T COMMIT?
TO PROTECT ROBERT?
I HAVE A SMALL CONFESSION TO MAKE.
I NEVER HAVE DANCED WITH A GUY.
ALTHOUGH, THAT ISN'T TO SAY THAT I WOULDN'T,
SOME OTHER TIME.
IF THE GUY WAS INTERESTED AND HE'D LET ME LEAD.
MY NAME'S DAVID ADDISON.
I'M A DETECTIVE.
YOU WANNA TELL ME ABOUT IT?
SO, UH, KENDALL CALLS ME AT THE BAR,
YOU WERE THERE.
AND HE SAYS TO ME, IF I MARRY HIS DAUGHTER
SHE GETS DROP-KICKED FROM THE WILL,
NOT THAT I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.
BUT HE TELLS ME THAT HE'S CALLED HIS LAWYER,
GOT HIM WORKIN' ON THE PAPERWORK.
SO I GO OVER THERE, TRY TO TALK HIM OUT OF IT--
LIKE I HAD A CHANCE IN HELL, RIGHT?
AND?
AND, UH, WE ARGUE.
I HIT HIM,
HE FALLS, KNOCKED UNCONSCIOUS.
I TURN ON THE GAS, BANG.
END OF STORY.
THAT'S IT?
THAT'S IT.
NO WHY?
YOU WANT A WHY?
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH SHE'S WORTH?
WHAT ABOUT LOVE?
WHAT ABOUT IT?
LOTS OF HEARTS AND FLOWERS IN OUR LAST CONVERSATION.
YOU DO LOVE HER, DON'T YOU?
LOVE HER?
LOVE WHAT SHE'S WORTH.
I RESENT THIS.
DON'T RESENT IT.
THERE'S NOTHING TO RESENT.
IT'S JUST A GOOD, INTELLIGENT WAY
TO MAKE SURE NOTHING...
TRANSPIRES.
YEAH, RIGHT.
TRANSPIRE THIS.
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY THAT.
REWIND.
FORGET THE LAST MINUTE OF YOUR LIFE.
LOOK, IF YOU'RE MORE COMFORTABLE SITTING IN THE BACK SEAT,
BY ALL MEANS, STAY IN THE BACK SEAT.
I'M JU--
IT'S LATE, THAT'S ALL.
I HAVEN'T HAD MUCH SLEEP THE PAST COUPLE OF NIGHTS.
I'M SORRY.
YOU'RE FORGIVEN.
LOVE DOESN'T COUNT FOR MUCH IN THE WORLD, DOES IT, DAVID?
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS--
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT US, I'M TALKING ABOUT THEM.
MARGARET AND ROBERT.
LOVED EACH OTHER, WANTED EACH OTHER,
SHOULD'VE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE EACH OTHER--
HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY LOVE EACH OTHER?
MAYBE THEY DO AND MAYBE THEY DON'T.
THEY SAID IT, YOU JUST SAID THEY SAID IT.
NOT 10 MINUTES AGO,
YOU WALKED OUT THE INTERROGATION ROOM,
LOOKED MARGARET IN THE EYE AND SAID--
"HE TOLD ME TO TELL YOU HE LOVES YOU VERY MUCH."
YES, I SAID THAT.
I EVER MENTION TO YOU WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL
I WAS IN THE SENIOR PLAY?
I PLAYED EMILY IN OUR TOWN.
EMILY?
THAT'S A GIRL'S PART.
YEAH, IT WAS A HELL OF A CHALLENGE.
ALL BOYS SCHOOL.
WE HAD A MOTTO IN THE THEATER DEPARTMENT.
WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH, THE TOUGH SHAVE THEIR LEGS.
IS THERE A POINT TO ALL THIS?
I'M A HELL OF AN ACTOR, MADDIE.
YOU MEAN YOU LIED TO MARGARET?
YOU TOLD HER HE LOVED HER,
AND HE DIDN'T SAY ANY SUCH THING, DID HE?
WHY WOULD YOU LIE TO HER?
WHY WOULD YOU MAKE HER CARRY A TORCH FOR SOMEONE
WHO'S GONNA SPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE ON DEATH ROW?
I DIDN'T LIE TO HER, MADDIE.
BUT YOU TOLD HER ROBERT MURPHY LOVED HER.
EXACTAMUNDO.
AND YOU JUST ADMITTED TO ME THAT HE TOLD YOU HE DIDN'T.
YEAH, A GREAT BIG DOUBLE WHOPPER WITH CHEESE, HUH, MADDIE?
DAVID--
THE BEST LINE I HEARD SINCE
"I'LL SLEEP WITH YOU, BUT I WON'T TOUCH YOU."
DAVID!
HIS LIE, MADDIE, HIS LIE, OK?
WHEN I WALKED IN THAT BAR TODAY,
HE TOLD ME HE LOVED HER.
I HEARD IT, I FELT IT, AND I BELIEVED IT.
REGARDLESS OF WHAT HE SAID DOWN IN THE STATION HOUSE.
AND YOU HAVE A THEORY TO EXPLAIN WHY HE'S LYING NOW?
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE MARGARET DID BAKE THE OLD MAN,
MAYBE ROBERT DID IT,
MAYBE IT WAS JUST AN ACCIDENT,
I DON'T KNOW.
THE ONE THING I DO KNOW IS THAT GUY LOVES THAT GIRL.
THERE'S NO DENYING THAT.
AND NOTHING, NO RULE ABOUT THE WAY LIFE OUGHT TO BE,
NO PACT, NOT THE WARSAW PACT,
NOT A WHALE PACK OF PACTS
IS GONNA MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE OR MAKE THAT OTHERWISE.
WHICH IS WHY WE ARE GOING BACK TO THE KENDALL JOINT.
EWW, MY GOODNESS.
MY FAVORITE STYLE,
WELL DONE.
LOOK AT THIS.
AND ME WITHOUT MY SACK CLOTH.
THIS IS AWFUL.
DAVID, WHY ARE WE HERE?
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?
PERHAPS I CAN HELP.
DAVID, IT'S--
THE LATE MR. KENDALL, I PRESUME.
SO WHAT'S THE STORY?
CHECK FOR THE COFFIN BOUNCE?
OR WAS THIS ONE BOOKED ROUND TRIP FROM THE START?
I HOPE YOU'LL EXCUSE THE MESS.
US?
DON'T GIVE IT A THOUGHT.
WE'RE CASUAL PEOPLE OURSELVES.
I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION THOUGH,
AND HOLLER IF WE'RE OUT OF LINE,
BUT AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD?
QUITE DEAD.
YOU HEAR THAT, MADDIE?
QUITE DEAD.
PEOPLE SAY WE DON'T HAVE GOOD PLOTS.
SO, DEAD, HUH?
YOU PROBABLY GOT A LOT OF TIME ON YOUR HANDS.
MIND IF WE ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS?
HAVE A SEAT.
LET ME HOLD YOUR HALO.
NO HALO, MR. ADDISON.
QUITE THE CONTRARY.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND, MR. KENDALL.
3 MONTHS AGO,
MY DOCTOR TOLD ME
I HAD 6 MONTHS TO LIVE.
IT SEEMS THAT IT'S TRUE WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT SMOKING.
I TOLD NO ONE.
TWO MONTHS AGO,
MARGARET MET THIS MR. MURPHY.
AS HER LOVE FOR HIM BLOSSOMED,
MY DISTRUST OF HIS INTENTIONS GREW PROPORTIONATELY.
YET NOTHING I WOULD SAY OR DO
WOULD CONVINCE HER TO LET HIM GO.
SO, KNOWING I WAS DYING ANYWAY,
I PLANNED MY OWN MURDER.
I CALLED MR. MURPHY AT THE SALOON HE'S EMPLOYED BY,
ASKED HIM TO COME OVER, TOLD HIM WE NEEDED TO TALK,
AND HE CAME.
WE FOUGHT...
LOUDLY--
FOR THE NEIGHBORS.
AND THEN HE LEFT.
AND I TURNED ON THE GAS
AND BLEW UP THIS ROOM.
MY INTENT, OF COURSE, WAS TO PIN MY MURDER ON HIM
AND GET HIM OUT OF MY DAUGHTER'S LIFE.
I EVEN INITIATED A CHANGE IN MY WILL
SO THERE WOULD APPEAR TO BE A MOTIVE.
YOU WANT US TO BELIEVE THAT YOU WERE WILLING
TO GIVE UP THE LAST 3 MONTHS OF YOUR LIFE
TO KEEP YOUR DAUGHTER FROM MARRYING THE WRONG MAN?
SHE'S MY DAUGHTER, MISS HAYES.
I LOVE HER.
WHAT ABOUT THE BODY?
THERE WAS A BODY HERE.
I OWN 13 HOSPITALS, MR. ADDISON.
I FOUND WHAT I NEEDED.
BUT MR. KENDALL, DON'T YOU SEE WHAT YOU'VE DONE?
BOTH YOUR DAUGHTER AND ROBERT MURPHY
ARE TAKING THE BLAME FOR A MURDER NEITHER ONE COMMITTED.
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A LOVE EXPRESSED SO ELOQUENTLY?
EACH THOUGHT THE OTHER GUILTY,
AND EACH STEPPED FORWARD TO SPARE THE OTHER'S LIFE.
I GUESS THAT MAKES ME A DAMN FOOL.
MISS HAYES, MR. ADDISON,
IT'S DISCONCERTING FOR A MAN TO REALIZE
THAT, UH...
HIS DEATH WAS HIS GREATEST FAILURE.
SO LITTLE OPPORTUNITY TO RECTIFY IT.
BUT, I GOT TO TRY.
I CAN'T FACE MY DAUGHTER NOW.
I COULDN'T BEAR TO FEEL THE HATE SHE'D SURELY HAVE FOR ME
IF SHE'D KNOWN WHAT I'VE DONE.
I THINK, UH...
I'M BETTER OFF DEAD.
I'VE WRITTEN A NOTE.
A SUICIDE NOTE EXPLAINING SIMPLY
THAT I COULDN'T LIVE WITH THE PAIN OF MY ILLNESS.
NOW WHAT I ASK IS THAT YOU TAKE IT TO THE POLICE.
USE IT TO FREE MR. MURPHY SO THAT HE AND MY DAUGHTER
MIGHT HAVE THE CHANCE AT HAPPINESS THEY DESERVE.
ONE MAN'S WALLET,
$7.32--
MAKE THAT 33 CENTS,
I NEED YOUR SIGNATURE, PAL.
BOY MEETS GIRL,
BOY WON'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER,
BOY GETS GIRL.
NO MATTER HOW WRONG THEY SEEMED FOR EACH OTHER.
YESSIREE, BOB, WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.
ME?
RIGHT ABOUT WHAT?
LOVE, SEX,
THE PACT,
US.
I WAS?
I AM?
I ARE?
YOU IS.
AND YOU KNOW WHEN I GOT IT?
BACK THERE IN THAT POLICE STATION
WATCHING THOSE TWO KIDS.
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S REALLY OK THAT THOSE TWO KIDS
RIDE OFF INTO THE SUNSET TOGETHER,
SPEND THE REST OF THEIR LIVES WARM AND COZY
IN SOME LITTLE BREAKFAST NOOK.
IT'S BETTER THAN OK.
IT'S RIGHT.
BUT YOU AND ME, WE'RE DIFFERENT.
OH YEAH?
HOW'S THAT?
WELL, WE'RE TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN,
WE EAT SEXUAL TENSION FOR BREAKFAST.
DRIVE ON SLY, REPARTEE, DOUBLE ENTENDRE...
BAWDY INNUENDO.
YOU TAKE AWAY THAT EDGE, YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS?
THEY MOVE US TO SUNDAY NIGHT.
7:30.
YEAH, WE LET ANIMAL MAGNETISM GET THE BEST OF US,
WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?
IT'D BE TERRIBLE, IT'D BE WRONG.
IT'D BE WORSE THAN WRONG.
IT'D BE TELECIDE.
WELL, I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I'M REALLY GLAD YOU FINALLY CAME AROUND.
IN FACT, I'M ECSTATIC, I'M ELATED, I'M GRATEFUL.
DON'T BE GRATEFUL, I'M NOT DOING THIS FOR YOU,
I'M DOING IT FOR ME, TOO.
HAVING THIS OTHER AGENDA WITH YOU
HAD ME WOUND TIGHT AS A WATCH SPRING.
NOT HAVING IT,
IF I GET ANY MORE RELAXED,
I WON'T HAVE A PULSE.
JUST ONE THING, THOUGH.
WHAT'S THAT?
NOW, DON'T TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY, BUT...
THERE IS ONE TEENSY,
TINSY, NIT-PICKY QUESTION MARK
GNAWING AT THE BASE OF MY NOGGIN.
WHAT'S THAT?
WELL, THE PAST FEW DAYS HAVE BEEN QUITE A CLAMBAKE,
AND I REALLY DIDN'T COME DRESSED FOR THE PARTY.
IS EVERYTHING...
OH!
THAT?
IS IT?
OH, YOU MEAN, IS IT SAFE?
ABSOLUTELY.
YOU SURE?
OF COURSE I'M SURE.
DAVID, I'M A GROWN WOMAN.
I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY BODY
AND WHAT I DO WITH MY BODY.
THAT'S SOMETHING I DON'T TAKE CHANCES WITH.
GOOD, THAT'S GOOD.
YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING?
NO, I DON'T MIND AT ALL.
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
IT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION.
A LITTLE IRRELEVANT KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW
AND FEELING WHAT WE FEEL.
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY THAT I'M--
GLAD WHAT HAPPENED, HAPPENED.
I'M ALSO GLAD IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN ANYMORE,
BUT I AM GLAD IT HAPPENED.
I MEAN, IT WAS PLEASURABLE,
AND I DO THINK IT'LL DEEPEN OUR FRIENDSHIP,
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
YEAH, BUT, YEAH,
I MEAN, UH, NO, IT WA--
IT WAS PLEASURABLE FOR ME, TOO, UM--
VERY PLEASURABLE,
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT I KNOW THAT YOU DO WHAT YOU DO...
DID WHAT YOU DID.
NO, I DO, I DID.
KIND OF MAKES ME WONDER HOW MUCH MORE PLEASURABLE
IT WOULD'VE BEEN HAD I KNOWN
THAT YOU DO WHAT YOU DO
WHEN WE DID WHAT WE DID, YOU KNOW?
I GUESS WE'LL NEVER KNOW.
GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.
ALTHOUGH...
IT DOES KIND OF MAKE YOU WONDER
HOW MUCH BETTER STILL OUR FRIENDSHIP WOULD BE
IF WE DID DO WHAT WE DID KNOWING THAT
YOU DO WHAT YOU DO, OR DID WHAT YOU DID, DOESN'T IT?
DAVID...
DAVID, THIS IS UNCOMFORTABLE!
HERE, LET ME GET THIS OUT OF YOUR WAY.
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT,
IT'S ABSOLUTELY--
SAFE?
ABSOLUTELY.
IT'S ABSOLUTELY...
SAFE.

What a wild duet Still, theyre cousins
Hi, cousin.
Identical cousins and youll find...
If you're hungry, there's some din-din machmud on the bottom shelf.
What's din-din machmud?
Pig snout with saffron.
No, thank you.
I'm on a low-saffron diet.
Mm.
Ah.
What's this?
I'm doing a Myposian lint painting.
A lint painting?
Well, exactly.
On Mypos, we waste nothing.
Interesting story.
The first one...
The first one was done by Brektos, our spiritual leader, in the storybook days.
And the legend says that he went up on the mountain for 60 day and 60 night to contemplate his navel.
And when he came down he had a lint painting.
We've been doing it ever since.
How do you like it?
Uh...
Well, uh, what can I say?
You could hang this under any rug in the world.
Oh, cousin.
Oh...
You don't mean that.
- Oh, I do.
Thank you.
You know, it's because of you I got back into lint painting.
I see you take these pictures for the photo contest and it makes me want to do something creative too.
Well, I'm glad one of us benefited from all my hard work.
What the matter?
Can't you pick which picture to put in the photo contest?
Yes.
None of them.
What?
You're not going to enter the photo contest?
Ugh, who am I kidding?
The Chicago Gazette photo contest is one of the most prestigious.
It was just a crazy dream.
I thought if I won, my photojournalism career would have been launched.
Well, it would be nice if you were launched.
It would have been wonderful.
- But I don't understand.
You've been taking pictures for three months.
You must have a hundred here.
- A hundred and six.
And they all stink.
- No, they don't.
They are very, very good.
Balki, "very, very good" will not win this contest.
I need that one special picture.
I need something extraordinary.
Something that will make the heart of man leap within him.
Something that sums up the meaning of life.
You know what I mean?
Well, of course I do.
Don't be ridiculous.
You need something a little different.
Yes, that's right.
Well, what about this one of the kitty cat being carried away by the big bird?
That's different.
Balki, look at the kitty cat's face.
What do you see?
Fear.
Sure.
Sure, you see fear.
But the keen eye of the photographer sees a kitty cat with three whiskers on the left side of his face and two on the right.
There's no symmetry.
Okay, what about this one of the fireman catching the baby that was thrown from the burning building?
It's been done.
Why am I even talking to you about this?
You probably don't have photographers on Mypos.
Well, no, we don't.
But we have a guy named Nicholai who has a very good memory.
Whenever we have a fire, Nicky's the first thing we save.
Well, good.
Why don't we enter Nicky in the contest?
He's got a better chance than me.
Oh, cousin, I see what you're doing.
You had a crazy dream and you spent three months taking pictures.
And now with only one day left, you're just going to roll over and die?
That's basically what I had in mind, yes.
Well, let me tell you a story about an immigrant boy who had a crazy dream to come to America.
Wait.
- And he got on the tramp steamer.
Wait.
- Tramp, tramp, tramp.
Wait, I've heard this story.
It's not gonna do you any good.
I'm feeling sorry for myself.
If you were a real friend, you'd join in.
Well, I do feel sorry for you.
Poor little Larry Appleton.
He could have been a great photographer but he'll never know because he gave up.
Oh, I hate it when you do this.
In the years to come, you'll look back on what you might have been and you'll remember that your best buddy, Balki, said:
"Keep trying, Larry Appleton." But you didn't.
Can't you just let me accept failure?
Over my dead battery.
All right, all right, I don't know what I'm gonna find in just one day but I'll give it a shot.
- Now you're talking, turkey.
Now we are so happy, we do the dance of joy.
Balki.
Balki.
Why don't we hold up on that?
At least let me find a picture.
Cousin, somewhere out there is the perfect picture.
I know it.
And you're going to find it.
Yeah.
Yeah, and pigs can fly.
That would make a great picture.
The man just needed a little push.
Thank you.
Larry, guess what.
I got your mail again.
It's an easy mistake.
I'm in 302, you're in 203.
Perhaps the mailman has lysdexia.
That's dyslexia.
Is that it?
I always get that word turned around.
So did you send a picture for the photo contest yet?
No, but I'm going to.
I was gonna give up, but Balki wouldn't let me.
Sure enough, I found the perfect shot.
I'm gonna take it this afternoon.
- What is it?
It's a church with a cross on the steeple, but that's not the shot.
I am so proud of myself.
There's not a photographer in a million who would have even seen the shot.
At exactly 6:02, the setting sun drops between these two tall buildings and a shaft of light hits the cross, turning it this brilliant gold and it glows like something supernatural.
It only lasts for a second and then it's gone.
It's beautiful.
- Yeah, churches are nice.
See you.
Hi.
- Hi.
Cousin, I'm sorry I'm late, but wait until you hear why.
Mrs. Twinkacetti asked me to move some furniture in her house and behind the dresser, I found a gold mine in dust balls.
Forget the dust.
- Mm-hm.
You were right, I did it.
I found the award-winning photograph.
Oh, cousin, I'm so happy for you.
It's a church with a cross on the steeple, but that's not the shot.
I am so proud of myself.
There is not a photographer who would have even seen the shot.
Wait a minute.
This isn't the church where the setting sun falls between two tall buildings and casts a shaft of light on the cross that makes it glow a brilliant gold as if it had taken on a life all of its own, is it?
Well, it's the angle that's important.
What I'm gonna do...
Is get on the roof of the building across the street.
The address is 2...
- 2831 Garfield.
Can I tell this?
- Oh, well, I wish you would.
I have to get the shot this afternoon, otherwise, the jig is up.
I'm gonna get the owner's permissión.
You're gonna have to help get equipment on top of the roof.
Balki, I have this contest in the bag.
I'm on my way to the good life.
What means "the good life"?
It means the, uh, good life.
Wow.
I am so happy for you.
Now we can do the dance of joy.
- You bet.
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey.
- Hey, hey.
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey.
Hey!
- Hey, hey.
Hey!
Fred and Ginger, front and center.
I'm taking the day off to be with my lovely wife, my lovely children at my less than lovely mother-in-law's.
Appleton, this is what I want you to do.
I'll get there around 4.
Call my wife and tell her the store is on fire.
That way I gotta come back and spend the rest of the weekend playing poker.
See you.
Uh, Mr. Twinkacetti.
I can't tell your wife there's a fire in the store.
Right.
I've used that excuse before.
Tell her the turnip locked himself in the safe.
Who wouldn't believe that?
I can't tell her that either.
- What is it?
Make something up, Appleton.
Cousin...
- Not now, Balki.
Mr. Twinkacetti, I will not lie to your wife for you.
Appleton, someday, you will want something from me and no matter how small that something is my response will be a well-known gesture.
That building you want to get on the top of so you can take the picture of the church?
Yes, I know it.
I know the building.
I know it well.
What about it?
It's Mr. Twinkacetti's house.
Oh, don't cry.
- All right.
That was easy.
You know, you're bouncing back better all the time.
Balki, you and I are gonna get on that roof and we are going to get that picture even if it kills us.
BALKl:
Cousin, can you give me a hand?
I don't like this.
We're not supposed to break into somebody's house.
We're not breaking into Twinky's house, we're breaking onto his house.
Besides, he's not even home.
Just try to act like you belong here.
How do I act like I belong on a roof?
Will you stop worrying?
We'll be off of here in five minutes.
It's pretty far down.
- Only two stories.
The roof is pretty steep.
- I hadn't noticed.
Balki, get that for me, would you?
I don't think so.
Cousin, I don't understand.
You're the one that's afraid of heights.
You scream if you stand up in the bathtub.
Balki, I have to get this picture.
My whole future depends on it.
Nothing's gonna stop me.
There are no obstacles, and absolutely nothing can go wrong.
I know that nothing can possibly go wrong but have you noticed that it's getting a little windy?
It's a little breezy.
Fortunately, I have everything in my bag that you could possibly need in a photographic emergency.
Here, hold this.
Sandbags.
We can't have the tripod blowing off in the wind, can we?
Well, of course we can't, don't be ridiculous.
What about me blowing off the roof?
You're not a photographic emergency.
- I'm human.
That's not good enough.
Just hang on.
We'll be off here in two minutes.
Okay, give me the camera.
Balki, give me the camera.
No.
I have the camera, and I say we get off the roof.
Balki, give me that camera.
Uh-uh.
Look, there's the Wicked Witch of the West.
- Where?
Ha-ha!
You tricked Balki.
There was no witch.
Ha!
No way am I getting off this roof now.
No, I've taken this shot a thousand times in my head.
I've planned every minute detail.
Where'd that chimney come from?
- I bet it came with the house.
What idiot architect would put a chimney where it blocks the view of the church?
Where have the good craftsmen gone?
- Blown off the roof.
Cousin, you've flipped your coin.
You have plenty of good pictures at home.
If I can get on top of the chimney, I can still get my shot.
No, cousin, cousin.
Cousin.
Cousin, will you...?
Whoa!
Whoa.
Yeah, hi, Ralph.
Yeah, I can make the card game after all.
I told my wife the turnip got locked in the safe, ha-ha, and she bought it.
Who wouldn't?
See you at 8.
Balki, help, I'm in trouble here.
Help!
- Hush.
Never hush a man who's hanging by his fingertips.
Help!
Help!
Mr. Twinkacetti's home.
Help.
Help.
We have to get off the roof before Mr. Twinkacetti catches us.
Later.
I still have 50 seconds to get this picture.
If I hold on to this TV antenna I can hold the camera in one hand and lean out past the chimney.
That picture of the kitty cat is looking better all the time.
I can see it.
You know, I'm getting an optical illusión.
It looks as if the church is getting closer and closer.
Cousin.
Cousin, the antenna is bending.
Come back here.
No, no.
It'll hold for five more seconds.
I've got to get this shot.
Three, two, one, zero.
Minus one, minus two, mi...
Where is the shaft of light?
Where is the sun?
Maybe it's behind those big black clouds over there.
Cousin, don't panic.
Just slowly come back here.
The weather report said it was to be sunny.
Now the picture is gone.
What am I gonna do?
Cousin, just to get an idea of where you are, you might look down.
Now we're talking on the same channel.
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.
All right, you didn't get your picture, now we get off the roof.
I can't.
I just remembered, I'm afraid of heights.
Well, you picked a fine time to remember that.
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, we're going to wait until it gets dark and then you won't see how far down it is.
Did I mention I'm afraid of the dark?
Cousin?
Cousin, don't do that.
Cousin, it's dark now.
We can get off the roof.
I can't believe it.
I didn't get my picture.
This is all Twinkacetti's fault.
Boy, the next time I see him, he's in trouble.
What are you two doing up on my roof?
Mr. Twinkacetti, this is all my fault.
That goes without saying.
I was trying to get a picture of the church for my contest.
But he didn't get the picture.
- Cry me a river!
Okay.
Now get off my roof.
Okay.
The ladder!
- The ladder!
Now I'm stuck up here and it's your fault!
- My fault?
You wouldn't be up here if you were with your wife and kids.
I wouldn't have come up here if you weren't playing Tarzan on my antenna.
I wouldn't have had to if you'd put your chimney where it belongs.
I'm gonna put my fist where it belongs.
BALKl:
No, wait, Mr. Twinkacetti.
Stop, stop, stop.
Will you stop?
Whoa!
BALKl:
Whoa.
TWINKACETTl:
Let go.
Let go.
BALKl:
Ow.
We've got to stop fighting and find a way to get off the roof.
What did you have in mind?
Help!
- Save your voice.
No one can hear you.
Their windows are closed.
And do you know why their windows are closed?
Because it's starting to freeze?
- Bingo.
I'm sorry I got that right.
What else could possibly go wrong?
It was a rhetorical question.
You know, this might be a good chance for us to just chat and get to know one another.
I'm gonna throw the turnip off the roof.
And if we're lucky, he'll drag himself to get help.
And if we're unlucky, we're still lucky.
What was that?
- Thunder.
Ah!
I hate thunder.
You know there's something aesthetically pleasing about your face when you're terrified.
I want my wife.
Edwina.
Edwina!
That's great.
I think I got your face framed by lightning.
Ooh, you're cruel, Appleton.
No, I'm not.
Hold that whimper.
Yes.
Aah!
What's that?
- I don't know.
Is this another TV antenna?
- It's a lightning rod!
That draws lightning?
- It's a real good one too.
If we stay up here, we'll die.
Help!
Help!
Help!
"Larry Appleton, 10th place."
- Yeah, I'm good, all right.
I even helped somebody else win first prize.
I think it was very nice of someone to take that picture of the fireman rescuing us from the roof.
It's a terrific picture, if you call that composition.
Cousin, you won 10th place.
That's wonderful.
Well, thank you for making me keep trying, and for helping me get the picture.
And for saving your life.
That too.
Cousin, I couldn't let you quit.
Or die.
And if you ever see me giving up, you must stop me too.
That's what friends do for each other.
Yeah.
Why don't we go to Curly's newsstand and buy every newspaper he has to send to everyone you know?
Just like the time Mary Ann got in the paper because she got her head stuck in a chainlink fence.
It was her hair.
Balki, I don't need to buy newspapers because I don't need to brag.
But this is a great accomplishment.
You should be proud.
Ah, I don't need to send a newspaper to anyone.
The important thing is that I know.
Wow.
You're some humble guy.
Balki, a lot of it was blind luck.
I didn't get the picture I was after.
But if you hadn't risked your life, and mine, trying to get the picture of the church you never would have gotten this picture of Mr. Twinkacetti framed by lightning.
It is pretty good, isn't it?
- Good?
Good?
- Yeah.
Good?
- Ha-ha-ha.
What was the question?
The picture.
It's pretty good.
Well, of course it is, don't be ridiculous.
And I'll tell you what.
To celebrate, I'm gonna take you to your favorite place.
Not the petting zoo?
- You got it.
Oh, boy!
Are you going to ride the camel with me this time?
No.
The camel always spits at me.
Can I chase the chickens?
- No, you can't chase the chickens.
Question:
Am I wrong, or is that closet full of newspapers?
Not full, only head-high.
Oh, I see.
All right, so I got a few for my family, friends.
And a lot for my enemies.
My high school graduation class, Time?
Life...
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
( Carla humming )
Boy, look at her.
What a glow she has.
You know, strange as it sounds, there are actually times when I resent being a man.
Ah, that's all right, Fras.
Sometimes we resent you being one.
( Sam laughs )
I was referring to Carla's condition.
You see, she's able to do something we men never shall-- experience the miracle of creating a new life.
SAM:
You know, I'll have to admit.
I've often wondered what it would like to have another human being moving around inside you.
Must be spooky, but real neato.
Yeah.
There's probably nothing so awesome in the entire universe.
Yes, gentlemen, I'm afraid that we've been relegated to the position of observer.
Passive, sitting on the sidelines.
Doomed by nature to a life of envy.
God, feels like there's a dump truck parked on my bladder.
Well, then again, nature is wise in her way.

My jasmine scented oriental massage oil.
Oh, God.
God, I thought I'd lost this.
I found it wedged underneath the couch cushions in my office.
Ah.
I don't think I want to know how it got there.
I'm kind of curious.
Tell you what.
Why don't you, uh, put that back where you found it, and that way, we'll know where it is when we need it.
When hell freezes over.
Well, that's perfect, 'cause this stuff heats up when you rub it in.
Now, what... what's wrong with her, you know?
Maybe one of the chains in her underwear is twisted.

ALL:
Norm!
Hey.
What's going on, Mr. Peterson?
Let's talk about what's going in Mr. Peterson.
Beer, Woody.
How's the job-hunting going?
Oh, lots better, Sam.
Today I actually got turned down for an executive position.
It's a good way to lose that.
I'm sorry, Mr. Peterson.
You've been cut off.
Oh.
Okay, where's the camera?
This is no joke.
According to my books, you are way over your credit limit.
SAM:
Well, what's the big deal?
What's he over-- ten, 20 bucks?
837.
But in other words, under $900, huh?
You can't cut off one of our regulars.
The poor guy is unemployed.
FRASIER:
Look, Miss Howe, uh,
Norm here is in a very delicate spot.
His self-confidence has been shattered.
Uh, what he needs from us now is help and support.
Isn't there some other way to resolve this problem?
Well, you could pay his bar bill.
Norm, the woman will not listen to reason.
Maybe he could work it off, huh?
( laughter )
No, I'm serious.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.
Listen, maybe there's some accounting he could do for the bar.
Our corporation's books are handled by Franklin, Sussman and Gurwitz.
Ooh, they're very good, Sam.
They canned me a couple years ago.
Please.
( sighs )
Are you good at anything?
Yeah, but you cut him off.
SAM:
No, no.
Come on, don't you have any other skills?
I can barbecue.
Oh, hey, hey.
Yeah.
NORM:
All right, well, I, uh...
I did a little house painting in college.
You know, to make ends meet.
( laughs ):
Norm, Norm, Norm.
Norm, I think they're talking about a job where you get, uh, paid with money, not with little grain pellets dropped out of a chute.
Cliff, you, uh, you got something against painters?
( laughs ):
No, no, no.
I...
I'm in favor of hiring the blithering.
( laughs )
Do... do you need any painting done around here?
I guess you could repaint the office.
Are you willing?
It's been an awfully long time.
CLIFF:
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's gonna take you at least, what, seven or eight seconds to relearn that skill.
( laughs )
'Cause, you know, Cliff, I'm beginning to pick up a little thread here.
Uh...
Ah.
Would you mind explaining this little obsession you have about painters?
CLIFF:
Well, all right.
Uh, well, it's manual labor.
I mean, it's beneath you, Norm.
Well, if you take a job like this, we're gonna be on entirely different social strata.
We'll have nothing to talk about, all right?
Semigloss or enamel?
Hey, Woody, would you close up for me tonight?
I got to get home.
No problem, Carla.
By the way,
I really am envious of you having a nice big family to go home to.
Oh, yeah, it's great, all right.
I got 11 people living under a roof that was meant for only six.
Gino's dog just had puppies on my side of the bed.
My daughter-in-law is driving me nuts, and somehow, my mother-in-law got a hold of our address.
Puppies.
You lucky duck.
( humming )
You seem to be enjoying yourself.
Oh, sorry.
Uh...
No, that's all right.
Oh, uh, you got a phone call here, uh...
Eva Ake?
I could swear it was a man.
Oh, well, there's paint here.
Evan Drake.
Uh...
That's my boss.
Yeah.
What did he say?
Well, he said, he, uh... he wants you to tear up my bar bill.
I...
Well...
I didn't think I'd get away with that.
Uh, but, no, he said he's on his way over here.
Sometime, like, uh... around nowish.
Now?
!
God.
Shall I, uh, comb my hair, too, or will I be leaving?
This is just a business meeting.
( phone rings )
Rebecca Howe.
Oh, hello, Mr. Drake.
I thought you were--
Norm.
No, no, no, I know you're not Norm.
You're Evan.
What I meant to say was-- Get out of here.
No, no, no, not you.
You stay right where you are.
No, I swear...
Get out!
Oh.
Hello?
Well, that was fast, Mr. P.
Yeah, she got a phone call from Mr. Drake.
Hey, Mr. Peterson, I really feel bad about you being cut off.
Yeah.
You know, I remember the good old days when you used to come in here and say something funny.
I'd pour you a beer.
You'd drink it, I'd pour you another one, you'd drink that, too.
Yeah.
Yeah, I remember, Woody.
So look at that-- hardly even touched.
Yeah.
I'll tell you, I don't normally drink beer, but, uh,
I just cleaned the taps, and I wanted to make sure that everything was all right, so I had one.
It was like a mountain stream, only colder, fresher.
You know, sometimes there's nothing like a nice cold beer to really hit the spot.
Yeah, I think I read that somewhere, Woody.
You know, I-I really like this color.
I think it's gonna really spruce up the office quite a bit.
( sobbing )
Again, it's just an opinion.
Uh... ( sobbing )
Is there something wrong?
( tearful mumbling )
Right.
Well, yes, I understand, of course.
Here, here, have a seat, have a seat.
Just relax.
Oh, God.
Here.
Some authority figure.
I'm sorry.
It's probably just job stress.
Oh, you shouldn't be having job stress.
You're doing a great job here.
Oh, tell that to Mr. Drake.
He said I should consider the last fiscal report a personal embarrassment.
( sobbing )
Norm, I need your help.
Uh, you just started.
You're-you're gonna do fine.
Things are gonna turn around, I swear.
Uh...
No, you idiot.
My hair's stuck to the wall.
( sniffles )
Oh, great.
No, no, it's really...
It's not, uh...
not that bad.
I paid big bucks to have Vera's hair frosted.
Didn't turn out half as good.
Well, maybe I better take off.
When people are upset, they... they like to be alone.
Nonsense.
I'm fine.
Talking about me.
I'm feeling a little queasy.
Oh, please stay.
I mean, this office is a real inconvenience like this.
All right.
( sniffles )
Would you, uh, would you like to talk about what just happened?
No.
Phew.
( sighs )
You really do seem to be enjoying this job.
Yeah.
Yeah, I actually do, you know?
I think painting is just so vastly different from accounting.
This is real, you know?
This I have some control over.
I mean, when I look back,
I finish a job, I can say,
"You know, I did that."
Door must have moved.
You know,
I think that this color is the exact same color as Mary Lou Sebold's car coat.
Who?
This girl I had an insane crush on in the third grade.
Except she had no idea that I was alive.
I used to leave little notes for her.
"I love you."
And one day, I finally got up the nerve to sign one, N.P.
The next week, she was going steady with my best friend, Nicky Petropolis.
What'd you do?
The only thing I could do, really.
I went over to Nicky, and I calmly explained the situation.
Then I sat on him.
( laughs )
( continues laughing )
Oh, God.
I think that's the first time I've really laughed since I took over here.
Oh, it is, trust me.
Why'd you tell me that story?
Well, I don't know.
It's kind of late.
We're alone.
I'm a man, you're a woman.
Maybe it's the paint talking.
Norm?
Yeah.
Do you find me cold?
You?
Cold?
No.
No, I wouldn't say cold.
Coolish.
In the brisk area, but, uh...
Why?
Who, uh...
who says you're cold?
Everyone.
Oh.
Well...
I don't think you're cold.
Really?
Yeah.
I always meant to tell you that, but I didn't feel as though I could approach you.
Thank you, Norm.
Oh.
Thank you.
Uh, well, I'd better get out of here.
Um, would you mind locking up for me?
No, no, I don't mind at all.
Listen, would you please not, uh, mention that I like painting to the guys?
Cliff already thinks I'm a weenie.
Well, from what I've seen, he's an authority.
Yeah.
Well...
And, really, thanks for letting me paint an office that clearly didn't need it.
No problem.
You're a nice man, Norm.
You're kind of nice yourself.
I guess we like each other.
Guess so.
Great.
This will just be our little secret.
Oh, yeah.
I am a little worried about the direction this bar is taking.
How so?
Well, it just doesn't seem right when the stakes for a game of pool is a round of wine spritzers.
Not even the pool room is safe from the encroaching hordes of yuppiedom.
How long will it be until we're all suffocated beneath an avalanche of alligator shirts,
German cars, and racquetball club memberships?
Oh, oh, by the way, Sam, uh, may I have another Perrier with lime?
Have a cup of coffee or something, Sam?
Make it a beer.
On the house.
I say we check the office for pods from outer space.
I wonder what that's all about, huh?
Look, did it ever occur to any of you that she just might be a nice woman?
Oh, yeah, right.
And so am I.
( sighs )
So, how come you guys are so chummy, huh?
Sorry, Sam.
Can't talk about it.
Kind of private.
Oh, give me a break.
Guys are supposed to talk about girls behind their backs.
( swallows hard ) Didn't I tell you everything about me and Diane?
Well, now's your chance to thank me.
I'm not really at liberty to go into details.
Suffice it to say,
Miss Howe had a little personal crisis last night, okay?
Few tears were shed.
Real tears?
You sure she didn't just pull a hair out of her nose?
No, Carla.
She got a little sad, and I happened to be there to comfort her.
I think it really just takes a little warmth and compassion, and she warms right up to you.
Compassion, huh?
Mr. Malone.
Mm-hmm.
Do you realize we're running low on seltzer?
I'm so sorry.
Ho-How can these things happen?
Is there anything I can do?
Yes, let me know next time.
Well, of course I will.
I just hope that's enough.
Are you feeling all right?
Yes, thank you very much.
That's very sweet of you to ask.
Norm, I gave you my address, didn't I?
Yep.
See you tomorrow.
See you.
Whoa, what was that all about?
Just a little bit of painting at her apartment.
Listen, uh, you know, I can really sympathize with your situation of painting.
Uh, you know, if the fumes and everything bothers you, you can always spend the night at my place.
I don't think so.
That's it.
I say she's a guy.
Good night, Sammy.
Say, uh...
Norm, wait a second here.
You know... you know, I like to paint.
Why don't I help you, man, you know.
( scoffs ) Come on.
No.
I know you.
You just want to log a little sack time with her.
Come on, no.
The truth is, I just...
I got to find out if there's a real human being in there, man.
I-I can't keep working for a cold fish.
Please, come on.
All right.
But no funny stuff.
No, I swear to God.
I won't touch her.
I won't touch her.
I make no guarantees about you.
You've been driving me crazy in this little white outfit.
Yeah?
You should see me in my caftan.
( doorbell rings )
Oh, hi, Norm.
Come on in.
Thank you.
I was just...
Hi.
Oh, God.
Now it knows where I live.
Sorry, I, uh, needed a helper, and when I checked around, most of the fellas expected to be paid.
And you're doing this for nothing?
Well, it's an act of compassion.
I'm doing this out of the... goodness of my heart.
Norm.
Yeah.
I'd like all the wood here and the moldings done in high gloss.
Great.
You have any questions, if you need anything, I'll be in the back.
NORM:
Okay.
So that's where the old bedroom is, huh?
Sammy?
What?
I'm not doing anything.
You promised.
No, I'm fine.
All right, I want to start with, uh, sanding for you.
Here.
All right.
All right, uh, try this post right here.
Yeah.
I'll do a little taping.
Hey, come on.
Hey, Sam.
What?
Sam, uh... you have to do it with the grain, okay?
Oh.
Sand with the grain.
My arm hurts when I do it like that.
Very sorry, Sam.
That's the way it has to be done, all right?
I don't think I like sanding.
Just try to tape one pane at a time, all right?
I don't think I like taping, either.
Norm.
Hmm?
It's Carla on the phone.
Your wife needs you at home right away.
Something about two feet of water in the basement.
( groans )
Oh, boy, that's serious.
That's, like, a foot more than usual.
I'm sorry.
It's just a little delay.
I'll be right back.
No problem.
Sammy, can I, uh, trust you here alone?
Yeah.
Swear to God I won't touch her.
Tragic, huh?
Absolutely tragic.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, I just couldn't help thinking about Norm's basement.
Yes?
Well, it's not just, you know, the water filling up.
You know, it's those photo albums, those old letters.
Cherished mementos, you know, ru-ruined for... ( weepy ):
Oh, I'm sorry.
Ooh, boy.
Oh, this is embarrassing.
I-I'm sorry.
I just, uh... ( sniffles ):
I can't help feeling this way ever since my dog, Lucky, died.
Something is going on here.
I'm not exactly sure what it is.
Could it be that you're jerking me around?
Okay, uh... ( clears throat )
I'm sorry.
It's just that there's a rumor going around the bar that you've got this soft side, and I just thought I'd like to see it for myself.
Maybe get to know you better.
I guess I ought to just...
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I want to get this straight.
You came over here on your day off to paint my living room in hopes of getting to know me better?
Pretty silly, huh?
What'd you want to know?
Well?
Um, I'm thinking.
I-I didn't think I was gonna get this far.
Uh...
Well, all right, all right,
Um... where were you born?
San Diego.
San Diego.
California, huh?
No, Kansas.
Come on.
My father's a captain in the Navy.
My mother's an interior designer.
My brother's a surgeon.
My other brother's an attorney.
My sister was Miss San Diego.
( mimics gagging )
The only really happy moment of my life is when I ran away to San Francisco and hung out with Grace Slick.
Do you want to know the lyrics to "White Rabbit,"
or can I quit now?
Ah.
Boy, it sounds like some of the kids in your family are pretty successful, huh?
Yeah, well, if you measure success in terms of wealth, happiness, and my father's undying devotion, maybe.
Yeah.
Boy, I know.
I got a brother like that.
International lawyer.
Handsome, smart, funny.
And the guy plays the piano, and he speaks four languages, flies his own jet.
( mimics gagging )
Seems like my whole life
I've been trying to get out from under his shadow.
I know just what you mean.
Does he ever come in the bar?
No, but, uh, I'll call him, if you'll call Miss San Diego.
Nah.
They'd probably end up leaving together.
( both laugh )
Well, hell, this is kind of a warm and friendly moment, isn't it?
I must admit, it's a... better moment than I ever thought
I'd have with you.
I'm glad this happened.
Yeah, me, too.
Me, too.
Will you excuse me a moment?
Sure.
What are you going to do?
I think I better change.
Honesty.
Who would have thought?
Say, can I, uh-- great, great-- can I, uh, put on some music here?
Sure, be my guest.
( jazzy music playing )
( laughs )
( Velcro unfastens )
I'm gonna be at the gym for a couple of hours.
But you just go right on...
You jerk.
Wha... what?
This whole thing about coming over here and painting is just another stupid attempt to get me into bed.
I-I am shocked and... and deeply insulted.
God.
I told you all that personal stuff about my brothers and my sister and me being the fattest girl in high school.
Wait a minute.
You didn't tell me that.
Well, I wasn't.
Get out.
Slow down here.
Just li...
I admit it.
I'm a attracted to you.
Now, what's the big deal?
Is that a crime or something?
You know, are you always this defensive about people who find you sexy?
No, just you.
Is that right?
Well... you know, I'll tell you something, lady.
There was a time when I was considering making love to you, but now it's out of the question.
As a matter of fact, you know, I wouldn't make love to you if you asked me, if you begged me to make love to you, I wouldn't.
Go ahead, just ask me.
Just try it.
See what happens.
Would you make love to me?
Well, okay, but just once.
TIMESTALKERS
Scottie!
Billy!
Kids.
Cowboys?
OK, hot shot,
I'm coming to get you.
Allright, that's it...
That's completely out of character.
Dog Holiday was never a backshooter.
It just happened.
Allright Billy.
If you're not going to play fair...
I'm going to eat your face.
Okay, children.
Back to the real world.
Don't bother packing a lunch for me.
I'm just going to eat some of this kid's head.
Oh, no.
Sometimes I wonder which of the... two is the child.
He is.
Let's go partner, the stagecoach is waiting.
The stagecoach needs to leave soon.
No horsepower, eh?
Hey Dad.
I want to go to your college today.
You're a little young to go to university.
Through the window, Dad.
Through the window, pal.
Here is your essay.
It's all very good.
Why would any kid who knows as much about the old... west, want to write something about the zoo?
Let's teach him how to open car doors first... before trying more difficult things.
Agreed.
Give us a kiss and you got a deal.
OK.
See you soon.
Yes
Dont spend too much time playing with them guns, stranger.
Goodbye Daddy!
Get down Billy!
No!
- No.
Don't go near.
- Move away quickly.
- Let's go
- Leave me
I don't believe it.
Every single day for an entire year.
Scottie!
Hey, Joe.
How are you?
Well, at least democracy is saved.
- Listen, let's hit the road
- The road?
Oh, Scottie.
Already forgotten the Auction?
Auction.
- It's at half past four.
- Of course.
Why not go ahead?
I'll get my things... and follow.
Ah, you see Scott, I thought we could... go together and then we'll see...
Karen and her friend and get something to eat.
I can't.
I must correct some proofs.
Oh, why not come with me and my chauffeur will brings you back?
Right.
Let me get my jacket.
I wish we could camp here.
We're like kids in a candy store.
I see what I like.
It was delivered by Texas John Cody
- Is it authentic?
- Yeah, I think so.
It is a single batch.
Assorted chests, papers and other... curiosities from the west.
Well this is your sort of thing, isn't it Scott.
And mine, too.
You know, it's a shame to be bidding between us.
I have an idea.
I'll bid and... we'll divide it between us.
Right.
I want this
Trade done, partner.
It's got a bullet hole.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please.
The auction will be starting soon.
Sit and please ensure that you have a number.
We can not recognize bidders that do not... have a number.
Thank you.
Obliously we will start the auction... with lot number one.
A knife.
A special knife.
This knife is like Jim Bowie's knife.
It has a large steel blade.
Probably used to skin buffaloes and other... nastier things.
You can see that long ago someone bothered... to repair this knife... using a piece of buffalo skin.
In my opinion this confirms that it is authentic.
So who makes a first bid of $ 500.
Hey, stranger.
A man does not dismount here unless invited.
Yes, I forgot.
The smell of that coffee made me... forget my manners.
Here.
I'm obliged.
Where do you come from, friend?
Driving cattle to Tucson?
No need to drive them so far now.
The railroad transports them since 1880.
Where are you going?
Not sure.
I'm looking for a man.
A gunslinger.
He has a pair of 45s with ebony handles... and a silver star.
Are you the law?
Have you seen him?
- It seems that...
- No.
We haven't seen him.
You run out of coffee?
What was his name?
Whose?
What was his name?
I only remember the guns.
A pair of 45s with ebony handles and stars like you said.
It was in...
Crossfire.
In the town of Crossfire.
If you are not faster than my bullets, don't even try.
1800 razor sold to... number 16.
Now to batch 27.
It consists of two chests.
One made of skin and the other of tin.
Containing well, let's see... what it contains...
Old photos, old papers... also a bottle of red eye... empty, sorry to say.
However, it contains a lot of history.
Many great stories I would say.
As we shall see...
Has what aoppears to be a bullet hole.
Now do you want to bid please?
Lot 27.
Quiet!
CROSSFIRE CALIFORNIA
Give me a whiskey.
Looking for a man.
He has a pair of 45s.
ebony handles... and silver stars.
I'm not the sheriff.
Of course not.
There's no law in this town.
It wouldn't be healthy.
We have not seen anyone here, you know.
Ebony and silver stars?
A bit fancy for this town.
Just like the clothing you wear
Fancy.
From the east, right?
Yes, I come from far away.
You lie.
You have very little dust.
How did you get here, buddy?
I have come...
I came by train from Tucson.
Lies again.
There's been no train here for more than two days.
We've seen guys like you before.
From the east looking for easy money.
Adventurers.
Bounty Hunters.
I wonder, what type would you be?
I have neither ebony or silver stars.
Just plain wood.
Five Points.
Should be very good.
I'm the best.
I believe you.
That's just words, friend.
Your eyes say something else.
Boys.
Did you like what was in the bag?
Like the hole you'll have in your head.
Yes good.
Good.
No, no.
The Journal wants nothing more.
I can not have all these people here.
Listen, I am the Mayor of this town.
I have a right to be in the photo.
I don't care who you are.
You can be next.
Everyone can be.
But I need a very clear picture.
If you want to get away, finish it.
All ready, Mr. Mayor.
Move up please.
Get away.
Here we go.
Well, 190.
Who's gonna bid 200?
Sold to Dr. Mckenzie.
$ 200, thank you.
You're welcome
Well, let's divide the spoils, my friend.
Ok.
I am looking for a gunman.
There are many out here.
Now, there are three less.
Thanks to you.
He has a pair of 45s with ebony handles... and silver stars.
Have you ever seen someone like that?
Silver stars?
I haven 't.
Did a military escort pass through here?
For Crossfire?
No.
Is there a snake-shaped river here?
Like the old rattlesnake?
A few miles from here.
In what direction?
North.
Listen.
This type with the silver stars, who is he?
What's his name?
This is why I came.
To find out.
Listen, if you ride, you might be interested... in a couple of horseshoes.
Professor, the General awaits.
Thank you, Sergeant.
So this was all there was in this bag you bought?
No.
There were other things.
Leather straps, skins, papers, more...
This is the best there was.
Well, it seems that I finally got you, Scott.
I got the best of the lot.
A pair of Mexican spurs.
Originals, silver and brass.
Recorded and sealed.
Original buckles, too.
Look, why do you want to enlarge these pictures...
- if only...
- Humour me.
Shall we?
Okay, Scott.
After I'll show you...
- my Mexican spurs.
- Can I use them?
They are antiques Scott.
But also... so are you.
already found what you sought?
Can you separate and expand this man standing in the background?
Karen has a sister.
Remember Karen?
The girl I go out with.
has a very beautiful sister.
I thought this Saturday we could... go out the four of us.
Thanks Joe.
No thanks.
Could we see the man better?
Scott, look, I know it has been hard for you.
I know it's true.
But life has to start again.
I want to focus on the handgun.
Listen, thank you for what you are trying to do... but I'm happy as I am.
I want to focus on the revolver.
Of course, there it is.
Listen, Scott, when we're young we think this is the... only reason for living.
It is time to seek a psychiatrist
I think I've been had.
It looks like a...
A 357.
It is exactly that.
A 357 Magnum circa 1980.
No, it can't be.
It's impossible, Scott.
It's not impossible.
See the shape of the canon.
And see how the cylinder looks.
- Well, maybe, but...
- Maybe nothing
It's a 357 Magnum.
A modern weapon.
Can you make me some copies, please?
There's something wrong here, John.
I think I've been had.
If you've been had, what about my spurs?
The photo is marked as 1886.
And I'd say it's authentic.
No possibility of an error?
Scott, you asked me for a thorough examination.
I did all the tests.
Chemical evidence, spectroscopic.
This photograph is at least 100 years old.
There is no doubt.
What is your problem?
Look at the revolver in his hands.
Yes.
Suppose I tell you that the pistol is a... 357 Magnum revolver.
Made in 1980.
Scott you could tell me that it is a watering can... and I wouldn't know the difference.
But what I do know is that this picture is at least 100 years old.
TIME TRAVEL ?
THEORY OR POSSIBILITY
Many scientists, this last century... including Einstein, have provided us with data... indicating that someday time... might be manipulated.
We've explored the possibility of an advancement ... in weaponry in 1886 remaining undetected and unexploited.
But we discounted that as an impossibility.
I promised you that today we would have a departure.
I think the way I planned it was that we would have a mystery... in history
Now,
Definitely a mystery in history.
Next time I give a history class.
remind me not to do it in a physics building.
You all have those folders before you... containing my thesis.
Are there any comments?
Any questions?
Should I interpret this as an awed silence?
OK, professor.
You're joking, right?
I mean you've got to be joking.
- No.
- Time Travel?
What is this?
Like April fool's day?
Very funny, Frank.
Are there any serious questions?
Yes.
Can you take me back to last Saturday night?
Please don't.
You're going somewhere, Mr. Esterman?
Professor, with all due respect.
The hour is up.
It was heavy enough reading the notes... without contnuing analysing...
I have other classes to be thinking.
I would have thought you'd be more receptive.
Receptive to logic, professor.
Fine, that's it for today.
Today, professor, or tomorrow?
- Or yesterday?
- Or last year?
That's very funny.
It's a pity you get...
no notes for cynicism.
A TIME TRAVELLER IN 1886?
DR. SCOTT MCKENZIE.
Perhaps I should knock.
Who are you?
My name is Georgia, Georgia Crawford.
How can I help you?
I have come a long way to see you, professor.
I read your report, your thesis.
You and I are doing research along the same lines.
Don't tell me.
You gonna draw on me?
Of course not.
I would like to see the phioto, please.
What photo?
The one you showed the jesters in class.
Why do you want to see it?
I am a person who shares your obsession... on the old west.
Your thesis fascinates me.
I need to use your instincts... to balance mine.
Professor Mckenzie, I believe you.
- You are from the east, right?
- What?
I know a little bit about accents.
Yiou're from the east, right?
Right, yes.
Right.
The east.
Did you run all the tests?
Spectroscopy...
Alignment of particles.
Fibre examination, all of it.
A waste of time.
How is that?
Well, the picture is obviously authentic.
Look at the shadows.
What about them?
Look.
A current camera always flashes... next to the lens.
But at that time...
The held the flash on top.
Which shortened the shadows.
See?
Hadn't you realised?
Of course I realised, Miss Crawford.
I have this photo memorised.
The shadow has obviously been shortened.
Great.
We think alike.
You bet.
Do you know where the photo was taken?
Not yet.
This is our next step.
Miss Crawford, do you have any idea... how many towns in the old west... grew and disappeared out of nowhere?
Yes, I know.
But what can you tell me about the town in this photo?
Well, it was important.
There was a photographer... and also a newspaper.
Which means... that it was something more than a simple town.
Very impressive, professor.
No wonder you were considered... the most important expert.
Were?
Well, they'll say that, don't you think?
Now, these mountains should not have changed.
If we could align this photo with the real mountains......
This is ridiculous, it could take months.
Time is relative, professor.
You should know that.
Do you have a room where I could change?
We should make a start.
- Take your pick.
- Much obliged.
Little Jack, Little Jack.
I want to also.
What do you say?
I say you won't get anything.
You say no damn thing.
I said nobody was to leave camp.
We're not part of your band.
You get paid to do whatever you're told.
We got to wash too, no?
What you have to do is rob a stagecoach.
and we have to be ready for when it arrives.
Oh, Bart. It won't arrive until...
It will arrive when it arrives.
Maybe before.
And here you are playing in the river like a bunch of idiots.
Out of the water, let's go!
The Pulmari river, but known as the old rattler before, an important stop for travellers... and famous hideout for bandits and outlaws.
Why are we stopping?
Because I'm tired.
I've been through here dozens of times... and say it's a waste of time.
That's all right.
No need to enter defense mode.
I'm not in a defense mode.
Whatever that means.
All right.
Suppose that we do find the town.
What will it prove a hundred years after the facts.
I cannot believe a great historian... can doubt the validity of the first verifiable step.
Right.
What is the next town?
- Crossfire.
- Ah, yes.
They tried to restore this town two years ago.
And I know that the only thing they accomplished... was a failed trap for tourists.
We have to see it.
It won't take long.
I'll put a little music.
That's the ashtray.
People used to come here with their family.
Professor, I think we have solmething.
This is it.
Crossfire!
Put it there, partrner.
I don't know whether you're clever or just plain lucky.
Both.
Yes.
It happened here in 1886.
Right.
Let's separate and see what we find.
I'll go down this end of town and you go that way.
Right.
I guess I should congratulate you on your determination...
TRAVEL
JULY 1ST 1886
Where the hell did you come from?
I was right here, sir.
You scared me.
You must have indian blood or something... to walk so silently?
I'm looking for a man.
Hell.
Everyone is looking for something.
This is not an information office.
It's very important to me.
He is my height.
Has white hair and a long white coat.
Ah, yes.
I saw him.
He was here a while ago.
Killed three men.
I hope he is your friend.
- Whre did he go?
- I don't know.
He asked me about thez old rattlesnake...
- river.
- Much obliged, sir.
What's this for, dad?
Well, Sheriff...
In the old days... when the bad men went into the saloon to drink... they left their children here to dry up.
Is that true, mum?
No.
This is where boys fall off... and break their heads.
Very good, Sheriff.
- Time for a you know what?
- Bath.
- Yes.
- Daddy, save me.
Crawford?
Crawford!
TRACKING
Hey, lady.
What's going on?
Well, I suppose that it's time you knew.
I'm living proof that you are not crazy, professor Mckenzie.
I'm a human being of flesh and blood.
With one interesting feature.
I was born 600 years after you..
600 years?
I come from 2586.
2586?
I'm one of your time travellers.
One of my time travellers?
How many of you are there?
TRACE MAY 15 1986
Help me to understand.
In this skeptical century, I thought you would be the only one that could understand.
You've discovered part of it.
It was your thesis.
Yes, it was a bit naive...
- Naive?
- Good, you were a rookie.
Why are you telling me this?
Professor, I came back in time to find you.
Because I think you can help me.
You can of course.
And so I went back.
- Back?
Where to?
- To 1866.
1866?
I've been on a horse and rode from here... to the river.
One hundred years ago called Old Rattlesnake.
And I was here.
You talk about it naturally, travelling 100 years... like someone caught in heavy traffic.
Well, I expect you to be shocked.
But I do wish you to get over it quick.
Because I need your help.
I need your mind, your books, and all the information you can find... about this town.
Our world in the future is not perfect.
But we haven't had a war in 80 years.
Why are you here?
To fing Joseph Cole.
And who is he?
The man in the photo.
What a foolish question.
You came back to find the man in my photo.
You have to be dumb not to realise.
Dr. Joseph Cole, a brilliant and ambitious man.
And very, very dangerous.
Cole is one of our greatest scientists.
He is a physicist, microbiologist.
He even has a degree... in history, like you.
And why is he so dangerous?
In a world of peace?
See, it's a fine and fragile situation.
An irresponsible scientist can put everything in danger.
So, in my world, our scientists are monitored... and controlled.
And the creator of this control is my father...
Matthew Crawford.
He works in Washington.
and Cole worked with him... and for him.
Together they made the greatest discovery... since the splitting of the atom.
A machine to conquer time.
That's when it all started.
Listen to me.
Cole, this equipment does not belong to us.
All our research belongs to the Federation.
We've reinvented the wheel.
Makes you feel proud.
Crawford, proud nothing.
I'm proud of the possession.
Possession is an antiquated conceit.
Not for me!
I have poured my blood into this.
And now I hold it... in the palm of my hand.
Time!
We can return to the past and... change things as we please.
Joseph, as your friend and colleague I'll pretend...
I did not hear this.
Well I say again.
You're my partner.
Do not tell me what to do.
Have you finished.
I don't know, don't know what's happened to me.
I'm sorry.
Fifteen years on a project... and now can go no further.
Maybe one day they will allow us to use it.
Not while I have control of the lab.
It has been so for years, Cole, you know.
Since your father was here.
Yes, and his father and his father's father and his father.
I know.
I work for you.
You're not considering a change?
Don't worry.
Nothing has changed.
Congratulations, Doctor.
We should have known.
To be careful.
Cole was not a man to surrender easily.
Yes, Mike.
We just got a call from District 5, Sir.
Two blocks from the residence of Dr. Cole.
What happened?
Power overload readings from that residence, sir.
And it appears that the time crystal is missing.
- You're certain of that?
- Yes, sir.
The investigate immediately.
Mike.
Cole is authorised to collect antique weapons.
Be careful.
And don't go alone.
Yes, sir.
You stole the time crystal.
And these clothes.
Turn around.
Sergent.
And that was all.
Cole escaped in time.
Literally, to 1886.
And why did you come to me?
Your thesis.
The one you tried to deliver to your class.
- No?
- Yes.
It still exists.
600 years after Saved by laser.
You're not kidding me?
No way.
A dozen pages of argument about... the possibility that a man was photographed... carrying a Magnum in 1886.
- Wow!
- It was a very good lead.
Why you and not the cops?
Strips?
Police, detectives, investigators.
My father made a new time machine.
We were the only ones who knew how to use it.
It was top secret and training someone else was impossible.
So I came.
Why did Cole come back to 1886?
Right.
Why?
To change history
That was what I feared.
Hey Tex.
We haven't had a western movie here in a long time... so I would take off the Wyatt Earp coat.
Heading for the next village, mister?
Village?
What the hell, hop in.
Do you know where I can find a vehicle... with two seats over here ?
There are many vehicles like this, friend.
The one I'm looking for is black and white.
The insignia says...
Insignia?
You mean the licence plate?
Yes, the plate.
Thge plate says:
FSTDRAW
Yes, sure.
I know this car.
It is very difficult to fix.
It belongs to that crazy professor at the University.
On central.
- Central?
- Yes, central.
Thanks for the lift mister.
We have to assume that Cole was at Crossfire... for a reason.
What he has planned... must have something to do with Crossfire.
That's it.
So why not go back to make sure...
I'm sure.
And that was in July 1886.
The date of of the photo.
Not chosen by chance.
He was prepared and was dressed appropriately...
Also the blacksmith confirmed that he was in the photo.
So?
There are many days.
Yes, I could go back... and sit there and wait first... until July 31.
And what happens...
If I'm not at the appropriate time and place?
I must discover the right date or he'll escape.
I have a friend who could help us.
Texas John Cody.
What he does not know is 'cause it never happened.
Hey, mister.
Why not move your vehicle and avoid me giving you a ticket?
Of course, I'm sorry.
Could you tell me how to get to the University?
Go down about two stop-lights, take the first left.
After the second lights, turn right.
After half a mile down the road, can't miss it.
Well, now comes the good part.
What do you think of this, missy?
This usually hates women.
That's a risk I should take.
Would you share a drop of rye with me?
- No...
- Yes, please.
You yes.
Right.
Neat, please.
Yes, neat.
Cheers.
Quite brassing.
Yes, very brassing.
Can I have another.
Oh yeah.
A bird can not fly with only one wing.
Why don't we go see if we can find... something on Crossfire?
Ah, yes.
Crossfire.
Very good idea.
Come.
Lets go to my office there.
Let's see what we got.
Good.
Let's see.
Crossfire.
There's nothing.
Try old rattler.
Old rattler.
SONGS
Ah.
Seems we strike it lucky.
Know how many people could read and write...
- in those days?
- Not many.
If you could write your own name, likely they made you the judge.
- But they could sing.
- Yes.
These songs served as history books... handed from generation to generation.
And I have the best collection of songs of the west in the world.
All duly recorded.
Crossfire, let's see.
FOUND TWO SONGS
Good.
It seems that our program gives two possibilities.
A. Ol' Rattler River.
B. Ballad of the Star Handled Stranger
This doesn't help us at all.
It has no lyrics.
You noticed?
Clever, aren't you?
Yes.
Let's continue.
Right.
Said there were two possibilities.
So let's try the other.
Take it easy.
" 'Twas in '86 by the old Rattler's curve...
"That the star handled stranger,
"Showed the blue boys his nerve,
"when them gun totin' outlaws rode out of the west
"up came that sweet stranger and showed them who's best
"He came out of nowhere and in a flash he was gone 'left them outlaws behind him
"dead everyone!
"They'd come out a' shootin' like bees from a hive.
"but that star-handled stranger
"kept the blue boys alive."
Well, I can give you a tape and a transcript, if that will help.
Yes, it would help, John.
These legends are told, some exagerated... distorted with the passing years...
But I always found a basis of truth in them.
- Does this help you?
- Yes, I think so.
- Thanks, John.
- Okay.
- Thanks Cody.
- Come again.
We can play some cards.
- Yes, if you know you'll lose.
- Yes.
Where the hell did he find her?
With starry handles.
Why starry?
Sometimes the star meant something special.
I don't know.
Who were the blue boys?
The army.
Well, the cavalry here?
What was here in 1886 if there was no war.
An escort?
Escorting what?
A shipment of arms?
Gold?
Or people?
It would have to be... someone very important to have a military escort.
Like who?
The President.
Who was the President at that time?
- Grover Cleveland.
- Very good.
I'm a history teacher.
I had a look at the documents.
There was nothing mentioned.
It must have been a secret mission.
- Yes.
- Is it possible?
Very possible.
We know that nothing bad happened to the President that year.
Do you think we're going the wrong way?
I don't know.
Do you think Cole heard our song?
Possiibly.
Cody left his collection to the Smithsonian when he died.
Sorry.
Brodsky.
Joe Brodsky.
Texas John knows all about the old west.
But Brodsky knows everything concerning the cavalry.
Great.
He's collected army relics for years.
Letters, memorabilia, everything.
- Why don't we stop and call?
- Yes sir.
Everything you have about the cavalry.
What's thge big deal, Scott?
Especially during the summer of 1886.
In and around Crossfire.
I need it fast, Joe.
All you have.
But tell me.
What are you up to, Scott?
It's for a girl.
A girl?
Why didn't you say, buddy?
This is good news.
I have been telling you that... you should find a nice girl, you know.
You can call me John "cupid" Brodsky.
Well, she's a little old fashioned.
But you know you can't have everything.
Listen, give me a call as soon as you find something, ok?
Are you hungry?
I was before I entered here.
You jnow, there are a thousand things I wanted to ask... about how the world is 600 years in the future.
The longer I'm with you, the less I think I know.
Well, if you lived in my time... or even the time of my great grandfather... you will have heard of Crawford.
My father, Matthew, was the innovator of a social... economic system.
And I think...
Hello!
Matthew Crawford.
And if Cole returned to prevent a chain of events... which end up destroying the only man who stands in his way.
My father.
Presidente Cleveland had a secret advisor.
A mystery man behind all his decisions.
Matthew Crawford.
I believe that this man was his ancestor.
- and travelled in that stagecoach.
- Right.
Along with the President.
This explains the escort.
- The mystery, everything.
- And if Cole kills him?
That would end of all descendants, no father, no family line, no Crawfords.
to your father.
No more ancestors.
- And my end.
- Right.
We have to ascertain that date.
Hello.
I'm on a search between Tucson and Darkwood.
If you leave a message.
I'll call you when I get back.
Thank you.
Scott.
I'm calling you earlier than expected.
Good.
I was lucky.
I found what I wanted.
Cavalry around Crossfire.
Look.
I have a lot of material here.
Several dates.
You'll have to tell me...
They are waiting Mr. Brodsky.
Yes, just a moment.
Well, Scott.
I made some copies.
Should I send them to you or will you come and pick them up?
Sir.
The Senators are waiting.
Gotta go, Scott.
Call me, alright?
Look, look at that.

Cole.
Doctor Mckenzie.
Every story has an end.
And you found it.
But I need to do this for free.
Are you alright?
I think that's it..
It seems he made copies.
Extracted from the secret report of the U.S. Cavalry.
July 1886.
Orders to escort the President to Tucson in Cleveland... to attend a secret meeting with...
The War Minister of Mexico.
The troops met with thugs who attacked... the stagecoach near the river Pulmari.
Listen to this.
Disaster was averted by the intervention of a stranger.
Who used with deadly aim... a revolver engraved with silver stars.
Does it give a specific date in July?
But President commented that the fireworks he... saw that day were better than the ones he had seen... a week ago in Washington.
Wait a minute.
Washington?
Fireworks in July?
Independence Day.
It has to be.
4th of July.
And the attack occurred a week later.
Four plus seven...
The 11th of July.
You think so?
It's all we've got.
We've got to go back to July 11, 1886.
Professor, it's risky.
Cole is a murderer.
Maybe you should not go back.
Lady, I must be very honest with you.
There's not much here for me.
Not now, not for a long time.
I feel like my entire life I've been... expecting this moment.
I don't know if I could go back to feeling like this.
You must take me to 1886.
You can not deny me this.
Come with me.
Press your hand here.
Here.
What will I feel?
For a moment... it feels that the entire universe is ours.
11 JULY 1886
Welcome to 1886.
Wow.
Looks the same.
Oh yes.
Look here.
- My car.
- Left in the 20th century.
I hope I remembered to turn the lights out.
If. it was on the eleventh, it hasn't arrived yet.
The song said it came from the west.
The attack took place right there.
This is the perfect place for an ambush.
They come right out from under the sun.
Right now, they could be here, hidding.
Let's get out of here.
Keep the horses quiet or I'll quiet them forever.
You sure they're coming?
They will come.
And if there is no gold?
It's a stagecoach with escort.
What the hell do you think they're protecting, idiot.
Cole must be here too.
- Here comes the coach.
- Get down.
Woou!
Woou!
Woou!
Dismount.
Get the stagecoach out of here!
Where is the stranger?
There he is!
Cole.
Of course!
He eliminates the man who historically saved the day.
And transforms a frustrated attack into a successful... veritable massacre.
Not if we can help it.
Professor.
Professor!
We cannot let him win.
Professor!
Don't do it.
He'll kill you!
Professor!
Step back, Mr. President.
- Get down, Mr. President.
- Watch out, Mr. President.
Cover me.
Crawford!
Crawford.
Cole.
Please stand back, Mr. President.
Major, please.
Dismount, sir.
Draw, professor.
After you, sir.
Congratulations, Professor Mckenzie.
You succeeded just in time.
Are you alright, Mr. President?
Well, I can continue my mandate.
Who is this man.
I'd like to thank him.
I don't know, sir.
Major.
Go get him, he deserves a medal.
Yes, sir.
- Major.
- Yes, sir.
It is best to wait a bit.
- He's very hurt, sir.
- No.
I'm fine, thank you.
Are you sure?
Have we met?
No.
Where do you come from?
We are just making passage through the hills.
I thank you.
And thank you, stranger.
You're welcome.
Take care of yourself, please.
You too.
A little higher.
Left a little
Just a little more.
Slightly to the right.
It's perfect.
They're beautiful, aren't they?
Yes, they are.
You will have to take good care of them.
For both of us.
Going back east?
Yes, to the east.
Take me with you.
You're not of my time.
It's against the rules.
Stay here.
Nor am I of your time.
Sorry, I can not.
Do you understand?
Yes.
I suppose.
Then why the long face?
Sometimes...
Sometimes in my life it seems that when...
I get used to something it goes.
You'll be allright.
I'll miss you.
And I you.
Promise that if any time I need your help...
I can come back and rent you a bit?
Of course.
What?
I can not break the rules but...
I can bend them.
Wait a minute.
Goodbye, professor .
- Through the window, Dad
- Through the window, pal
Here is your essay it's very good
Why would a boy like you who knows so much about... the old west want to write about the zoo.
Let's teach him how to open car doors first... before trying more difficult things.
Agreed.
Give us a kiss and we'll call it a deal.
OK.
See you soon.
Dont spend too much time playing with them...
- guns, partner.
- Goodbye, Daddy
No!
Drive.
Get out of here, quickly
Park.
- Billy, are you okay?
- Yes.
- My God Scott
It's almost as if... you knew.
en
Well, house like this, you've got to expect the foundation to settle a bit.
Just going to have to do something about that one of these days.
Oh, dear.
What a mess.
Must be those damn raccoons again, huh?
I'm going to have to put a screen on top of that chimney.
Really going to have to shore up the foundations.
Oh, well.
Que serà serà.
Damn.
Boiled fish again.
Well... have to replace that thermostat, that's all.
Well, if it isn't one thing, it's another, hmm?
Oh, that's convenient!
I've been meaning to rearrange these books, anyway.
Let's see.
How should I rearrange them?
By author?
No.
By title, hmm?
Maybe by color, huh?
No.
Amanda.
Oh...!
Damn.
Dad!
Merry Christmas.
Amanda, you're supposed to be spending Christmas with your mother.
What's the matter?
Aren't you glad to see me?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yes.
Of course.
Delighted.
-lt's just that...
-Just what?
It's just that I'm surprised to see you-- that's all.
Look, I've been having a difficult time lately.
Everything is so...
unpredictable.
Well, I couldn't stand the idea of you spending Christmas all alone.
Well, I'm not really alone.
I mean, l-l mean, I don't mind really being alone.
I was beginning to think you didn't want me here.
Oh, honey, don't.
Don't ever say that.
So, smile.
You're allowed to smile.
Where's your Christmas spirit?
I did buy a turkey.
And I got the tree out, and I decorated it.
You did the tree all by yourself?
I got to see it.
Amanda!
Amanda!
God, what happened?
Oh, oh, that?
Well, you know me.
You know how clumsy I am.
I'm always knocking something over.
This isn't like you at all.
Well, it was just a couple of accidents-- nothing to really worry about.
Dad!
It's okay. lt's okay, baby.
It's just the foundation settling-- that's all.
Dad, there's something seriously wrong here.
No.
No, I don't think so.
Listen, I got an idea.
Why don't I make you a nice cup of hot chocolate, huh?
Nothing cheerful as a cup of hot chocolate, is there?
Come on.
Come.
Come on.
What was that?
What was that?
I told you.. it's nothing.
It's just the house settling..
that's all.
No, no, it...
it sounded like some animal.
Look.
I told you.
Oh, oh, those.
Those are old marks, honey.
Ah, come on.
Let's have that cup of hot chocolate, and then we'll stuff the turkey.
Hey, I've got something that I was going to... I was going to deliver it over to your mother's house.
Dad.
Go on, open it.
It's Christmas Eve or it will be soon.
Dad, they're beautiful.
They're not real, but the jeweler says...
"Only an expert can tell the difference."
Oh.
Dad, I love you!
Hey, it's the carolers from St. Anne's.
It wouldn't be Christmas without them, huh?
Come on.
Let's go to the front door and sing with them.
Come on.
Okay.
Make them stop!
I'm losing my mind!
Lord Beelzebub, help me!
Hear my plea!
Beelzebub!
My Lord, you heard me.
We hear all suffering in the depths, demon.
Every sigh.
Every tear.
Every complaint.
That's what makes it Hell.
I'm honored beyond all demons.
Don't be.
I just came up here to shut you up.
All Hell is murky with the echo of your yattering.
But my Lord, this... this man, he's... he's some kind of saint.
I'll never snatch his soul.
He's not a saint.
He's a pickle salesman.
But he'll break, like all the rest.
First, he'll admit the presence of evil.
And then he'll lose faith in the existence of good.
And next, he'll start to question his fate and ask, "Why me?"
And finally, he'll curse God.
And then... he's mine.
Not this one.
I've tried everything.
I sent such lustful dreams to his wife, till one day he walked in on her and his best friend.
And what did he do?
He said, "Que serà serà."
Italian.
A charm against disappointment.
"What will be, will be."
Then I put his cat in the microwave.
My masterpiece.
Fur and cat brains all over the kitchen walls.
You must try harder.
Let me touch him, just once.
Please.
No.
There are rules, demon.
Even for us.
A fingernail in the eye.
Did you learn nothing at the academy?
Read it, Yattering.
"Treaty of Job.
6522 B.C.
"Rule one-- 'Thou shalt not touch."'
And the penalty, name it.
"To become a slave."
Exactly so.
You have your instructions.
Break his pathetic human heart.
Crush his sanity.
Drive him to suicide any way you can.
But don't touch.
It's impossible.
Do it, or suffer eternally in his place.
Oh, no.
Not that.
Please, it's not fair.
Don't fail.
Eternity is a long, long, long... long time.
No, no, don't leave me.
Make them stop!
Make them shut up!
Thank you.
That was lovely.
Oh, yeah, yes, that was very, very nice, yes.
Something for the homeless?
Oh, yes, yes, of course, of course.
We'll see you next year, huh?
Thank you.
What's that smell?
Like rotten eggs.
I imagine it's just the drains.
I'll have a plumber in to see about them.
There's something alive in there!
You see, Amanda, it's probably just a raccoon.
It's okay. lt's okay, honey.
See?
It stopped.
My God.
My fault.
I should have gotten a frozen turkey.
I mean, this one is...
is too fresh.
Dad, this is no time for jokes.
I'm sure there's a rational explanation for everything.
What, the foundation's settling?
Well, maybe Santa Claus is playing tricks this year, and he got Christmas mixed up with Halloween.
You look pale.
Let me pour you a brandy.
Why can't you be serious?
This is happening now.
This is not some crazy story someone's making up.
I am serious about the brandy.
Dad.
Look, Amanda, the only possible explanation is too preposterous for words.
You mean a poltergeist?
Yes, all that stuff.
Bogeymen, things that bump in the night.
But we're a modern people.
We live in the 20th century.
We don't believe in bogeymen, do we?
Dad, I know what I saw.
That turkey was... was alive.
And now it's on the tree.
There's something evil in this place.
Whatever it is, we're just going to have to live with it.
Que serà serà.
Don't say that!
You know, you're a lot like your mother.
Don't say that either.
What do you want me to do-- call the police, or an exorcist?
Oh, maybe I should just let whatever's going on drive me stark raving bonkers.
Would you like to see that?
See the men in the white suits come and cart me away?
Look, I'm doing the only thing that I know how, and that is to take life as it comes.
And don't lose faith that whatever it is, it'll work out for the best somehow.
And that's Jack Polo's philosophy of life.
Now it may not be the greatest philosophy, but it's got me through 50 years, and I'm going to stick with it.
Sorry.
I shouldn't have criticized you.
No, it's all right.
Children should criticize their parents.
It's a way of understanding them, hmm?
Did you hear that?
Yes, yes, Amanda, I heard it.
Out!
Out!
No!
Not her!
You leave her alone!
Show yourself!
Show yourself!
Show yourself!
Show yourself, damn you!
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm perfectly all right.
In fact, I think I might take a walk.
Dad.
Do you care to join me, huh?
Huh?
Beelzebub.
You're about to fail.
But my lord, I'm so close.
Fool!
He's about to go back to his wife.
What?
Back to an orgy of forgiveness and compassion.
And you're wasting your time tearing up Christmas presents.
I'll-l'll stop him.
Don't let him set foot outside the door, or you've lost him.
I want him damned!
I'll drop by.
And if your mom asks me to stay, maybe I will.
That'd be great.
My God, we're locked in!
It won't let us out!
I'll tell you what-- why don't we try the back door?
Baby, come on!
I got it!
Damn!
Fooled by a mortal.
No!
Whoops.
Now, you see what you've done?
You've frightened my daughter.
Now don't you ever do that again.
Hell and damnation.
You hold your tongue.
There's a lady present.
Now, come on, come on.
No tricks, you hear me?
Come on.
Look, look, look.
Look, look.
Look what you've done to my place, huh?
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
What is that?
Oh, it's the thing they sent to claim my soul.
He's a minor, not terribly bright demon called the Yattering, I believe.
God, what do we do?
It's now my slave, isn't that right?
Yes.
Yes, what?
Yes, Mr. Polo.
But how?
Very good, very good.
He broke rule one.
Mustn't touch the damned until they're damned.
So now he's mine.
How did you know?
Oh, didn't they tell you why they wanted me damned so bad?
My mother was a witch.
Grandma?
Yes.
Now, you get busy and tidy up the place.
And when you're done, you can cook us a nice Christmas dinner.
Yes, master.
You know, they'll never let you into Heaven with a demon as a slave.
Oh, never mind that.
Get to work.
This place is an unholy mess.
It's all right.
We're safe now.
Dad, isn't that true what he just said about Heaven?
Possibly, yes.
But you know what I always say...
What are you muttering back there, Yat?
What is it that I always say?
Que serà serà?
Right.
Dad...
That's what I always say.
Aah!
They're killing him.
Purifying him.
You said this was supposed to be a fertility ritual.
It is.
He knocked up the chief's favorite wife.
I didn't come here to film a circumcision.
This has never been recorded before.
Zoom in.
Give me the fuckin' camera.
Don't be stupid.
Get your hand off that gun.
Try not to show any emotion.
It's their society, their rules.
Think how they'd feel about our gas chamber in San Quentin.
You're a cold-blooded son of a bitch.
You're not even human.
[GUNSHOTS]
- Aah!
- Aah!
[GUNSHOTS]
I'm sorry to chase off all of that bare titty.
What's the matter?
It took me weeks to get near the tribe.
You screwed everything up.
You have a son in the states.
- Jeremy?
- What's happened?
A major emergency, I'm afraid.
- Is he...
- We don't know, but your wife is sending frantic telegrams.
My ex-wife.
I didn't know you had a son.
How come you never said anything about him?
Can't this damn thing fo any faster?
I hope he's nothing like you.
You got something in your eye.
- What?
- Here.
- Ow!
- Watch the camera.
Ow!
Of course I'm coming back.
Nothing's more important.
What?
Sally, thank you for letting me know.
Well, well, well.
The son of a bitch is half human after all.
Joe, I'd like you to meet my husband Allen.
Yeah, sure.
Hello.
How's Jeremy?
Is he conscious?
What's the matter?
I'm afraid Sally exaggerated the situation.
I had to get you back up here, Joe.
How could you pull this kind of stunt on me?
We tried, but we can't get through to him.
The boy's deeply disturbed, Joe.
It's either you or commitment to a psychiatric hospital.
- Your choice.
- Sure.
Dump him in a mental ward.
- It's a very fine hospital.
- Who dumped who?
You haven't even seen Jeremy in three years.
Where the hell is he?
You're the big father figure around here.
You can't even recognize him.
Go ahead.
Find him.
There he is.
The kid in designer clothes, right?
Only you would put him in an outfit like that.
How you doing, son?
Didn't they just tell you?
I'm fucked up.
So now what?
Give me five minutes to adjust to civilization, OK?
I got a job offer in Peru.
Want to go to Peru?
Does it matter what I want?
Then there's Maine.
The Boondock.
The town's so small it's not on most maps.
Sounds hot.
You want a cab?
Maybe you don't, but I do.
Bring the rest of them.
This aunt of mine, did I ever mention her?
I don't remember you mentioning anything.
She left me this Bungalow.
It can't be worth anything.
When your mother was marrying that accountant,
- what's his name?
- Frank.
Right, Frank.
She left it to me as part of the divorce settlement.
It's got to be a dump.
By the time we pay that cab fare, we could buy a car.
I knew you were going to stop at this car.
She is a beauty.
How much?
What it says, 1,500.
That's the blue book.
For this pile of shit?
I like this kid.
The boss, next week he's going to lower this price to 1,200.
I can give you a break.
That's the best I can do.
This thing's going to need a couple hundred bucks worth of tires soon.
You're very mechanically minded.
You're a very smart kid.
Take it for 1,000.
Exhaust system corroded to hell.
I noticed that.
I meant to write that down.
Thank you.
- 800, please?
- What do you say, boss?
I don't care.
After I drive it, we'll negotiate.
Negotiate?
We already negotiated.
Before I drive it, he negotiates.
After I drive, I negotiate.
See how it runs.
Please run.
Anyway, it's called Salem's Lot.
It used to be called Jerusalem's Lot, but the natives, they shortened it.
Jeremy, I want you to put that cigarette out.
Don't do that.
Fuck you!
You're not my father anymore than the other three or four clowns.
I like some of them better than you.
I can take the criticism, but leave out the "fuck you," OK?
Shit!
How I hate being a fuckin' kid.
I just wish I was grown up already.
Are you good for anything but swearing and smoking?
- You know how to drive?
- Sure.
That's one thing I did, stole Allen's mercedes.
I spent some time here with Aunt Clara at Salem's Lot.
Wasn't long, just a couple days.
I'll never forget it.
There was this girl.
She was older than I was.
She was 17.
My Aunt Clara, she sensed something was happening,
So she put me on the train back.
She's not really my aunt.
She's a friend of the family.
She was nice.
I'll bet you that's why she gave me this house, to make up to me for all that.
Maybe she had nobody else to leave it to.
That's possible.
Well, you got us here.
10 gallons unleaded.
We're all out of unleaded.
Any sodas?
Any coke?
All out of that, too.
That figures.
Aren't there kids around here?
The old school look in good shape.
The historical society keeps that up.
We like to keep things just the way they were.
Say, friend, the old Hooper house, is that on the hill?
Behind the school on the overlook?
Yes?
No?
Maybe?
See you around, neighbor.
- Around what?
- Yeah, around.
You and I could have long discussions.
We'll have heated debates deep into the night.
Nice talking with you.
He's brought us his boy.
All grown up now.
Brought his boy.
A man now.
Our Joseph.
This house is over 100 years old, still standing.
- Barely.
- Watch your step.
Look at those nice house down there.
Why couldn't we get one?
This will be nive when we fix it.
I'm not going in there.
Kid's right.
It's a dump.
What did I get us into?
Thanks a lot, Aunt Clara.
Dad!
Dad!
Can you use your hands?
Carpentry, painting, stuff like that?
Shit.
I knew it.
Slave labor.
Shit.
Assholes.
Don't tell them that to their face.
What have we done now?
What have you done?
You folks got business around here?
What do you care?
Jeremy, I'll do the talking.
Go check out the school.
- You mean get lost.
- Right.
This is my house, sir.
It was deeded to me.
You got proof?
Sure.
Got it here somewhere.
There you go, Sheriff.
Constable.
Constable Rains.
Not planning to sleep there, are you?
How about my deed?
I'll show this to the judge.
You got a judge here?
Isn't this a small town?
Get this document back from Judge Axel personally.
That's the big white house on main street.
He's here.
Jeremy's here.
He's going to stay.
He's belong to us.
[THUMP]
What are you doing here, boy?
- Baa!
- Baa!
This town sucks.
5R30.
Correction, 5R34, 10-02.
[LOUD MUSIC PLAYING]
Turn off the ignition.
Get out.
Give me the keys.
What did we do?
Come on.
Let's go.
We didn't do anything.
Come on, man.
Let's go.
Let's go.
You kids ought to know better than to be speeding around
Jerusalem's Lot at night.
You mean Salem's Lot.
[IN CREPPY VOICE] Don't ever go to Salem's Lot.
An evil place.
Shut up, Sherry.
You're making it worse.
- Shut up.
- Are you making fun of our town?
I said, are you making fun of our town?
Just let us get out of here.
We can't let you go.
Tonight's a holiday.
We're celebrating.
Looks like a fuckin' party.
We got to teach them some respect.
Get away.
What are you doing?
Get away from us.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
No!
No!
Stop!
Your only chance is to make it to the church.
They can't follow you in there, understand?
Go to that cottage on the hill.
They'll help.
You understand?
Get off me!
Let me go.
Lady, tell them to stop.
No!
No!
Aah!
Help me.
Isn't there anybody here to help me?
God.
God, please, God.
Please don't let them kill me.
Please make them go away.
She'll go to Clara's cottage.
Yep.
Just like Judge Axel wants her to do.
Wipe your mouth.
Hey!
Hey!
Goddamn it!
That's my Jack Daniel's.
Yours?
It's half mine, you dumb son of a--
Girls.
Come here, girls.
Come here.
What are you doing out so late?
Why are you giggling?
What's so funny?
The cut of our duds?
Oh, look.
Hey, look at that.
What are you laughing at?
What's so funny?
Hey, Louie, I think they're retarded.
They're not retarded.
They're disturbed.
Disturbed?
Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing?
Get back, kids.
Get out of here.
They get any closer, I' m smacking them.
Yeah, hit a kid, go to jail.
Aah!
Aah!
What is that?
This town is weird.
Where'd I put that lantern?
Scared me, too.
Help me, please!
Please, help me!
What is it?
What happened?
Oh, God!
You're not going to believe me!
You'd be surprised what I'd believe.
Here, sit down here.
Jeremy, get her a glass of water.
They grabbed them, and they killed them.
There was blood.
Shit.
She is majorly stoned.
They're dead.
I know, but something happened to her.
Go get some hot water and towels.
Now, Jeremy!
Now, tell me what happened.
They killed him!
They pulled him out of the car and killed him.
- Who?
- The whole town!
You think I'm crazy, but it's true.
That's Judge Axel's house at the end of main.
He'll listen to you.
Jeremy, knock on the door.
Oh.
Now, take it easy.
Tell your story to the judge.
Sorry to disturb you, but it's an emergency.
I'm Joe Weber, Clara's nephew.
Something's come up regarding your constable.
No bother.
You're always welcome.
Come on in.
And the curiously dressed young woman, you step in, too.
Martha's in the kitchen taking care of the dessert.
This is our town physician, Dr. Fenton, Mrs. Fenton, and their lovely granddaughter Amanda.
My, my, my.
Oh, my poor child.
Goodness.
She's trembling like a leaf.
I think she has a fever, I do.
Come here.
Sit down.
Let's have a look at you.
From the look in the eyes,
I'd say she's been partaking illegal substances, and not too long ago.
But she claims she was attacked by your local constable.
That degenerate, Rains?
Wouldn't be the first time.
Axel, the children.
We shouldn't talk about sordid--
Pardon me.
Amanda, dear, take the lad to town hall.
Maybe he's never seen a wedding.
Of course, Grandfather.
I'd love to.
What wedding?
It's a small family gathering.
I'm certain the boy would be very welcome.
He's a dear boy.
It'll be all right, Dad.
I'll be fine.
[SHERRY] No!
Don't let them go out there alone!
Young lady, you must compose yourself.
Try to start making sense.
You're silly.
I'm so sorry.
I do feel safe here.
I guess I was dreaming part of it.
I remember, we were in the car.
I told them to stay off the road to Salem's Lot.
- They wouldn't listen!
- Your favorite.
It's her!
She's one of them!
Sherry, just calm down.
Easy, Sherry.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
- Leave her alone!
- She's ours now.
There's nothing more you can do for her, Joe.
- [SHERRY] Aah!
- They're killing her, aren't they?
Something like that.
You recognized your aunt.
- Clara.
- One of us.
One of what?
You still haven't figured it out, have you, Joe?
Mr. Professional Anthropologist.
You have run across the oldest race in humanity, nestled here quietly amid the folks, protected by a skepticism that says they don't exist.
Vampires.
Speak it again, Joe.
Vampires!
It's easier if you speak it.
What have you done with Jeremy?
Aah!
Aah!
Since when do vampires need guns?
Just for show.
[CLICK]
This gun probably hasn't been fired in over 100 years.
Contemporary people seem to understand guns more than anything else.
I understand a girl's been murdered.
Let's go look for your son.
You've seen more than most people.
You've traveled through a world of starvation, war, and killing for profit.
Do you think that that world is any better than ours?
You son of a bitch.
If you didn't have my son,
I'd kick your fuckin's ass around this town until you couldn't suck orange juice.
Jeremy!
We're all dairy farmers in these parts.
You outsiders grow stock for meat.
We grow them for blood.
See, human blood is still the best, but nowadays it's not quite good for you, what with drugs, alcohol, and this aids virus.
Then why go after people?
Oh, tonight's a wedding.
It's like a holiday.
We celebrate in tribute to past ways.
When blood was good and pure.
Course, Jersey cows give thicker, richer milk.
And richer blood, too.
I've seen enough cows.
I want to see my son.
In good time.
Don't be scared.
Who's scared?
Come, join us.
What a shame, all that going to waste.
You clean up pretty quickly after a killing, don't you?
See the missis there chopping garlic?
That should dispel one of the myths about us... and garlic.
Looky here...
This mirror.
My reflection is clear as yours.
It sounds to me like you want me to write all this down.
Yes, sir, young man, a true chronicle.
For who to read?
Oh, we don't expect this to go public for 200 years.
But write by someone with all the proper qaulifications, a somebody in his own time, my boy...
I'm the same person you loved when you were a little boy.
Were you one of them even then?
You took comfort in my arms all the same.
Yes, I did.
It was the happiest time of my childhood.
You could write something real important.
You could change the way outsiders feel about us forever.
- A history?
- A bible.
See, you have what they call credibility.
It's your profession to set down the ways of odd cultures.
You go on murdering passers-by, and I'm an accomplice?
Yes, that's... that's odd.
I've been explaining to you that our appetite doesn't extend to human prey... excepting now and again.
Axel, can't you see his mind is on the youngster?
He's worried sick about the boy.
Well, then, we'll just have to set his mind to rest.
[SHOUTING AND LAUGHTER]
[JEREMY] Don't you guys ever sleep here?
I mean, don't you even get tired?
No.
I get enough sleep.
There, you see, Joseph?
There's your Jeremy running happily with his newfound friends.
Dad!
Dad!
Just as safe as at home...
And just as happy as you were as a boy.
I'll get you!
Ah!
I have someone who will put your fears to rest, someone who's been waiting for your arrival, waiting patient.
[GIRL] Joey.
I've been waiting for you, my Joey.
I'd be happy if you could just be Joey again for me.
I think he's very cute.
Now, don't start that again.
Stop it.
He belongs to Cathy.
I stayed the same, Joey.
I waited for you, and I wanted to stay just as you remembered me.
I was 17, Joey.
You were only 14, too young, but I love you, Joey.
So I waited.
I knew you'd come back to me.
He's been ours since he was born, you know.
I don't trust him.
He'll betray us.
I won't take his soul.
He must give it willingly.
You just want to find out if any human can love us.
If he loves us, he'll be my successor.
If not, I'll send his soul straight to Hell.
- Good day, dear.
- Good day.
Jeremy!
Jeremy!
Walk slowly.
Just act calm.
I am calm.
Get in the car.
If we keep going to the end of the road, we'll be on the highway.
- Why run?
- These people aren't human.
They won't kill us.
They could have done that already.
If they don't kill us, what else is there?
Is that girl getting into your head?
Dad, let's finish the house like you promised.
You shut up.
Where were you all right?
You sure weren't looking for me.
Keep quiet!
What's wrong with you?
You want me to drive?
No.
What's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
[JOE] They give you something to take?
No, I'm not on anything.
They're against drugs.
I've been taken into a closed society, offered the secrets of what may be the oldest and most despised race on Earth, and I've found them here, not in some distant slavic mountain country, but as Americans.
I know they have killed for centuries, and I'm certain my life and my son's life doesn't mean a thing to them, but they want a bible.
Ow!
Ooh!
Shit.
So what's on your mind?
Not what you think.
Jeremy, have you, uh...
Did you get laid last night?
Who me?
I'm just a kid.
Did you?
You don't sleep.
You have this energy suddenly.
You can't wait till dark, can you?
They're all right.
At least they don't turn into bats.
I've come across lots of vampire bats up along the Orinoco River.
Them I could kill.
I don't like things that suck your blood and have conversations afterwards.
Don't stay on my account.
I'll be in good hands.
Oh, please, get to work.
I want you to come to school tonight.
They asked me to bring you along.
Oh.
Open school night, huh?
Bring your tape recorder, too.
What are you now, my research assistant?
You wanted us to go things together.
Well, here's our chance.
[SLURP]
[SLURP]
[SLURP]
It's our feeding time, Joseph.
These cows can replace this blood in a week, and we can feed again.
[SLURP]
Jeremy, go on to the school.
I'll catch up with you.
More kindly than butchering them, the way you outsiders do.
Although I must confess I prefer human blood.
Axel says I have a drinking problem.
- Who's this?
- I'll find out.
Can I help you?
Aah...
I thought you needed help.
That's why I stopped.
Where are you going?
It depends where the hell I am now.
You're in Salem's Lot.
Well, maybe you can help me.
I'm looking for a friend of mine.
Kesserling is his name.
You recognize him?
No.
How about looking at the picture?
Still no.
Your headlight's out.
I know it.
You know it.
The car doesn't know it.
He speaks dutch.
Do you know this face, young fellow?
Dutch.
Hmm?
I wouldn't know how a dutch accent sounds.
Let's go, Dad.
Is something up at this hour here?
They usually roll up the sidewalks at 10:00pm in these towns.
It's a special occasion.
Do you need directions?
No, no, thanks a lot.
You're very kind.
Be careful.
I go by instincts.
I'm a hell of a lousy driver.
I'm going to get killed like this someday.
Be careful.
You're lucky.
You don't know how lucky.
See what happanes when you get old?
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
We have some visitors who are new to our town, so, shall we review the year and circumstance that brought us to this land?
It was 1620.
Not the Mayflower, the other ship which everybody thought had sunk.
No shouting.
Yes, Amanda.
The ship was the Speedwell.
We thought it best others believe we perished at sea.
We knew what to expect from those pilgrims.
Puritans, they called themselves.
Hypocrites, I call them.
So we lit out on our own.
We came here in secret.
Far from witch-trials and persecutions, far from crazy mobs driving stakes through our hearts.
300 years of this?
So you see vampires are forever.
Do you have a question, Jeremy?
I don't get this.
Who are those people hanging out during the day running the shops and the stores?
- Drones.
- Shh.
Where do they come from?
We breed them for service, like we breed cattle for blood.
I don't like them.
They don't like being called Drones.
Again, it's that derogatory word that we do not encourage in the classroom.
Uh, turn to your page 135 in the text, the spanish inguisition-- the brutality of man...
I guess they have no sex education here.
Let's go.
Thousands of people were killed...
Come on, Jeremy.
People perished for their beliefs.
Spanish inguisition-- ecclesiastical tribunal...
I can't wait.
I don't want to go.
I want to hear the rest.
It's not good for you.
Let Jeremy stay.
There's a lot to learn.
It's bullshit.
It's antihuman propaganda.
The boy has a mind like yours, inquisitive and skeptical.
- Please, Dad?
I have a carriage outside.
You and I can ride to Miller's pond.
Do you promise me you won't go back in that classroom and that you'll go home right now?
OK, I promise.
Jeremy?
If you're still out there, why don't you come back in?
We'd love to have you.
It's not far, Joey.
Remember how we came here when you were a little boy?
Always at night like this.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Jeremy, what is happening to you?
- You know.
- Know what?
Don't play games with me.
OK.
I've decided.
You can't spend your life in a child's boy.
No, a man.
To outsiders, I'll be trusted like a child, but I'll be as cunning as a man.
I'll serve better in the image of a child.
Serve?
Be a slave, you mean.
Slave?
Who's the slave?
I didn't see you run away the first night.
You're the one who wants to write their bible.
I'm an ambitious asshole.
You said so yourself.
We're both caught.
[MOOING]
Dad, I can't sleep.
The sunlight hurts my eyes.
You want an aspirin?
I have to do it.
The pain won't go away until I do it.
I know.
I know.
Amanda, no.
No, not yet.
Here, Jeremy.
I hope it gets dark soon.
It will.
It's going to be all right.
It will be all right.
Stop!
Stop!
Go back!
Let us go.
Why don't you let us go?
I'll kill you, you bastard!
Uh!
Oh!
Ah!
Ya!
[JEREMY] Leave me alone!
Dad!
Help me!
You're not hurt that badly.
- Just a few bumps and bruises.
- Uh.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Let him alone.
Well, Joe.
You've gone and kill Abner Pepper.
You took that poor drone's life during his 29th year.
Please, don't take it out on Jeremy.
It was all my idea to run.
It appears, Joseph.
That young Jeremy is about to have a little brother or sister to keep him company.
Is that so, Catherine?
Yes, Mrs. Axel, our child.
He'll grow up to love and serve us all his life.
He'll protect our graves.
No, that can't happen.
You'll love our baby.
I know you will.
You bastard.
You worked this out to bind me to you by blood.
Jeremy's down at the schoolhouse taking his vows.
Soon he'll be reborn.
Dead!
What he'll be is dead!
Why do you make it sound so all-fired awful?
It's no worse than having his tonsils out.
You took a boy from us, and now you're giving us a boy back.
You bitch.
You sons of bitches.
Give me my son now.
You promised you'd take no human blood.
If you take my son's blood, I'll kill you.
You'll have to kill me, I swear to God.
Joe, you've set yourself a good bargaining position.
I'm hardly interested...
Mind you, this little ritual can be completed if you don't hold up your end to the letter.
Don't worry, I'll keep my side of the bargain.
I'll write your bible.
So be it.
I think that young Jeremy should be living separately from you for a spell.
- Where?
- Well, never mind.
He'll be under my personal protection.
"Discomfortable cousin, knowest thou not
"that when the searching eye of heaven
"lights up the sphere that lights the lower world, that thieves and murderers range abroad unseen?"
Research material.
Be careful of the pages.
They crumble very easily.
Get busy.
Where did all this money come from?
We're very wealthy people, Joseph.
Can you imagine how rich you'd be if you'd get to live 300 years?
Just real estate alone.
We own land on the Boston common.
We have property all the way up through Maine and New Hampshire.
Why, vampire life and financial security go together.
And not a penny from the government.
I'd like to talk with you.
I got nothin' to say.
I've been asked to write a bible about your people.
Why didn't you leave when you could?
You're one of them, aren't you?
Or you're half one of them.
Axel's my grandfather, but I'm dirt to him.
I'm just someone to protect him when he sleeps.
Then why don't you run off?
To where?
To your world?
There's nothing there for me.
Axel, aside from being what he us, doesn't seem all that bad.
Axel lets you see what he wants you to.
I saw him once when he was angered, when he lost control.
I saw his true face.
Jeremy!
Jeremy!
Jeremy!
Give me my son back!
Clarence!
Clarence!
Clarence, you must have seen Jeremy.
Where do they keep him during the day?
That's not for you to trouble about.
But I'm doing what I'm told.
I'm writing till my hand is paralyzed.
Why can't I see him?
And you don't have any feelings about this.
Are you a human being?
Do you have any thoughts, any feelings?
You should be nice to me because your baby will grow up to be just like me.
It's OK to hit us drones.
That's what we're here for.
Ooh, tourists.
I hate tourists.
My friend Kesserling said he came through here and bought your best Hepplewhite.
Don't tell me Carl here isn't a customer of yours, a regular customer.
Yep, I'm telling you that.
You know, always the best merchandise is kept in the cellars.
Can I take a peek?
We're closing.
- You want me to leave?
- Yes.
All right.
I'd give my right ball to have such working hours.
Uh, mister, you still not lost?
Oh, I remember you.
Don't tell me this is the same town.
What's it called?
Jerusalem's Lot.
Mm-hmm.
You said Salem's Lot.
Same place.
Well, I got lost.
You know that ridiculous feeling of being helpless?
Are you still flashing that picture on everybody?
Would like to take another look at it?
Say, see that police car?
Couple times it circled around here.
Keeps looking at me.
He likes to give out tickets, so I'd run along if I were you.
Well-- oh!
My glasses.
Wait a minute.
I can't drive without glasses.
Hey!
Open up!
You got my damn glasses!
It's getting late.
You can stay at my place.
- It wouldn't be an imposition?
- Not at all.
Do you want me to drive?
It's a necessity, I believe.
Go away.
I'm going to turn in, Mr. Van Meer.
If you need anything, you just holler, all right?
OK, Joe, good night.
I'll be up soon.
You.
What do you want, Sonny?
Listen, I have to tell you.
Well, so tell me.
That guy that you're looking for?
Yes?
There's a school teacher at my school who looks like him.
You sure?
You're really sure, now?
Huh?
Uh-huh.
OK.
Take a good look.
Take a good look.
Is that the man?
That's him, but with less hair.
That's good.
You're on the ball.
Very good.
Well, he's still down at the school.
At this hour?
What the hell's he doing at school?
He sleeps in the school building.
Why did they let you go?
What's going on here?
What's wrong?
You keep out of this.
Jeremy, you're trying to lure him there to get killed.
Don't worry about me.
I don't die easily.
Glasses or no glasses, you should get out of here.
You seem nice, Joe.
Why the hell would you protect a nazi?
A what?
- A nazi.
- A nazi?
Admit it, that's Kesserling.
- A nazi?
- Yeah.
- In Salem's Lot?
- Yep.
You know, even a nazi would have enough sense not to hang around Salem's Lot.
Then what the hell is all this secrecy about?
What the hell's going on in this town?
Shut up!
Just shut the fuck up!
And you, you go away!
What a rude boy, talking to his father like that, and in front of company!
- He's not himself, mister.
- You--
Can you read this without your glasses?
Yeah.
Yeah, my vision is improving.
I figured it would.
Ah.
Look at me!
Try this.
It gets their attention.
Wash his mouth out with soap.
Now you sit down.
Say uncle!
Say uncle!
Uncle!
OK, now you stay put!
Hear me?
Goddamn kids.
Hate these little puppies, coming around when I'm trying to concentrate.
Joe...
You trying to give me nightmares?
Keep reading.
Uh!
Where did you grab him?
- Right there?
- Ah!
Ow!
Hey, that works.
Now are you going to sit down?
OK.
Just leave me alone.
Well, what do you think?
Nobody believes in vampires.
Don't believe any of it!
He hates everybody in town because they're my friends.
He doesn't want anyone to like me.
You know, the pages I doubted at first, but you convinced me.
We've got a great opportunity here, my boy.
Make a right turn onto the main road.
Don't stop till we hit Bangor.
I said a right turn.
You're going back.
I know what I'm doing.
I'm a dutch jew, but my moyher was romanian.
Half my childhood I spent in the carpathian mountains, where all the tales passed, along with the remedies.
A church in Salem's Lot?
A museum.
They keep it there for appearances.
Doesn't make any difference.
If nobody desanctified it, it's a sanctuary.
We'll barricade ourselves in.
After sunup, we'll get them while they're asleep in the coffins.
Jeremy, you know where those coffins are hidden.
He won't help you.
We'll see if he's more scared of them or me.
There's those hybrids to deal with.
I've dealt with son of a bitches that made a deal with the devil.
I took this off an SS Colonel in Argentina, '52.
- You arrest them?
- I shoot them.
That cuts through the red tape.
I'm not a nazi hunter.
I'm a nazi killer.
I told you I was a lousy driver.
He got up.
Arrrgh.
This could cost me a whole New Windshield.
[SNARLING]
Shit, they're ugly.
Not tidy...
But the alter has not been desanctified.
All those legends are not bullshit.
We'll be safe here.
We got a lot of work to do.
[SIREN]
What's that?
Oh, no.
It's the short-line bus.
They diverted it to the center of town.
Hi, folks.
Don't be alarmed.
Welcome to Salem's Lot.
I'm Judge Axel, and there's been an accident.
Unfortunately, I'm going to have to ask you people to leave the bus and answer a few questions, names, addresses, and all that, and you may leave your personal belongings in the bus because you'll be right back.
I should have taken the train.
Shit, stuck in a dead town like this.
You broke your solemn vow, Joseph, released me from my promise, released us to seek human blood again!
- Jeremy, don't look at this.
- No, let him look.
Let him look.
Ah!
Oh, oh!
Aah!
No!
Ah!
Aaah!
Oohhh!
Oh, oh!
They sleep in the basement of their homes.
Not the children.
They sleep under the school.
Well, thank you.
My coffin's there, too.
What are you thinking right now?
The way those poor people sounded when they were being killed.
What else?
I don't know.
The smell, the funny smell inside that coffin, the dampness.
Disenchantment has set in.
Dad, I'm scared.
Jesus, I'm scared.
That's a good sign.
Here.
Shave that tip.
Judge Axel first, then the rest.
There's too many.
We can't kill the whole town.
I've seen bigger towns wiped out, towns with nice, harmless people, so I know it can be done.
[CRASH]
Mr. Van Meer, wake up.
We overslept.
We lost half the day.
How could we have slept so long?
Somebody must have put the hex on us.
We shouldn't have looked into the judge's eyes last night.
It's too late.
We don't have enough time now.
The hell we don't.
Wake the boy.
Let's move out.
Jeremy?
Jeremy, wake up.
Jeremy, we've got to go, but I want you to stay here.
I can help.
You can help more by staying inside.
Make them believe we're still here.
We've only got the constable and the deputy to take care of.
What about Cathy?
Who is Cathy?
She's, uh, one of them.
She's pregnant, and it's my child.
No wonder you failed to tell me about it, that girl.
Can you handle her?
You stay in this church.
Stay put.
You're safe here.
Don't move out of here.
Careful, don't spill that holy water.
Good, he thinks we're afraid to come out.
Get back in there.
That's what he wants us to believe he thinks.
What do you say, that way?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Aaah...
Grrrr!
Open the drapes.
This is your wake-up call, Judge.
Shit!
We've been had!
10 to 1, we'll be had again!
Look at that goddamn thing.
Arrraa!
Ah!
Yech.
And I thought I'd seen everything.
Murderers!
You're going straight to Hell!
Aaah!
Ah, Joe!
Aaah!
What grabbed you?
Not a damn thing, but it looked good.
[GUNSHOTS]
You hold it right there!
Ah!
Ah!
Oh!
Ooh!
Hmm.
Why couldn't I go?
I could have helped them.
Amanda, you can't be out here in daylight.
You'll die.
I won't die, and neither will you.
If you come now, we can live forever.
And he sleeps in a box.
That won't do any good.
Sure as hell won't do any harm.
Aaaa...
Mr. Van Meer?
I got another one, Joe.
Would you come here?
What's up?
I need your help.
Be right there.
What is it, Joe?
Mr. Van Meer, she's here.
I can't do this.
That's not a baby.
We've got work to do, and don't you dare buckle right now.
I'll take care of this.
You're not going to get Joe or his kid, you bitch.
Bitch.
Damn it.
I know you're around here some-damn-wheres.
Aah!
Joe!
What's the matter?
Too early to rise.
Can't come out.
Too early.
It's too soon!
Joe!
Aah!
Too early.
[GUNSHOTS]
Joe!
Joe!
Pull.
Aah.
On your right, Joe.
On your right!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Oh!
Aah!
Aah!
Judge!
Judge!
You're early, Sarah.
Close the lid before I burn.
Rains is dead.
Deputy, too.
They're going house to house now, killing as they go, killing off all of your followers.
Then I'll have to make more followers, won't I?
It's time we brought in some fresh blood.
Now let me rest.
Jeremy.
I told that kid not to leave.
Jeremy, don't hide on me.
I told him to stay here.
Sons of bitches.
They got him.
You're losing a lot of blood.
I've got more blood than I need.
Your boy told us his coffin is in the schoolhouse basement.
They want us to come there.
It's getting dark, and that's where they'll be.
We'll stop and get gas.
That's where they want us.
This should keep them busy for a while.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Joe, that window.
No bars.
I couldn't let you leave Salem's Lot without seeing this production that our young people have prepared.
Children.
Don't be alarmed, and don't be frightened.
They won't attack you unless I say so.
So I finally meet the head man himself.
Are you in a lot of pain, Doctor?
It keeps me alert.
At my age, I have a tendency to doze.
I'm four times your age, and still going strong.
Must be doing something right.
I presume you were dead once, so you'll know.
What's over there?
An indescribable sweetness.
God?
He forgives us.
Who is he-
- God?
Different from us as we are different from you.
Let me take away your pain, Doctor, and give you eternal life.
I've lived my life.
All right, gentlemen, it's showtime!
Jeremy, listen to me.
Dad.
Get up.
Get up now!
Dad!
Jeremy, they have no power over you.
You're free, and they're dead.
No!
Dad!
You are not dead!
Jeremy!
Jeremy, please!
Now for the traditional scene that you gentlemen tried to perform on some of the townfolk-- the stake in the heart.
Stand up!
I've seen my kinsmen die this way.
I've seen their bodies consigned to hell fire.
No!
Aah!
You'll never make a bloodsucker out of me, you bastard.
The human took his own life.
Do you see that smoke?
Do you know what's happening?
The coffins are burning.
Your homes are burning.
There's no place to hide.
When the sun comes up, you'll fry.
The sun will burn you right to your souls.
Every last fucking one of you, you're going to fry.
Dad, help me!
Jeremy, get up!
Get up and run!
I'm not dead!
Get to the cellar.
Save the coffins.
Let Cathy have them.
Aah!
Our baby!
Aah!
Our baby!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Get out of here.
No.
Aah!
The coffins!
Oh!
Help put out the fire!
Aah!
Aah!
[COUGHING]
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
You!
You've murdered all of us!
Isn't that why you brought me back here?
To bring you peace?
No!
Clara, pray.
Aah!
I think we'll be safe here.
We'll stay here until the sun comes up.
They'll either be dead or back in their coffins.
Amanda, too?
Yes, Amanda, too.
You've angered me, Joseph, made me lose control, made me show my true face.
Now it's time I took your souls.
You're mine now.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
[HORN HONKS]
[HORN HONKS]
[HORN HONKS]
[HORN HONKS]
Who the hell is in that bus?
Get on.
You've got more fucking lives than a vampire.
Suicide's for nazi SOBs.
Should have been an actor.
Shoot a gun, fall down, that's it.
I'd have been here before, but damn ankle.
I don't know how I got this tank moving.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
We'll find the state police and tell them.
Who'll believe vampires?
In 500 years, who'll believe there were nazis?
We couldn't have gotten them all.
I think they'll choose to die together, than wait for us to come back with help.
I think we'll find nothing.
All of the sudden I'm not in such a rush to grow up.
Me neither.
I guess getting old isn't so bad either.
Joe, I think he's becoming a human being.
Don't let his mother find out.
[HORN HONKS]

AGENT 1 :
Okay, stand by, everybody.
Tangos One and Two have now entered the Arrivals Hall.
AGENT 2:
Which has the case, please?
AGENT 1 :
Tango One has the case at this stage.
AGENT 2:
Right, hold on Tango One, then, please.
AGENT 1 :
Oh, there's been a changeover.
Tango One has passed the case to Tango Two.
And Tango Two doesn't want it, he's given it back.
AGENT 2:
What?
Are you sure that is Tango Two?
AGENT 1 :
Well, I thought it was Tango Two.
Whoever he is, he didn't...
Oh, no, it's Tango Two all right.
He just doesn't want the case.
Well, neither of them wants the case now.
AGENT 2:
Well, who has the case?
AGENT 1 :
Tango One.
Well, they're looking around now.
I think they may...
They may just be beginning to get a little bit suspicious now.
I think they may have sensed the camera.
AGENT 2:
Have they rumbled our position?
AGENT 1 :
I think they've rumbled our position.
AGENT 2:
Well, pull out, pull out.
All units, trouser, trouser, trouser.
All units, trouser, trouser, trouser.
Pull out.
Anyway, the hire car was absolutely ready and waiting when we arrived at Heraklion airport.
We'd done a deal with Hertz, through Amex, which meant we were able to upgrade the category without paying the extra price differential.
This is one of the Hertz girl, Tonya, with the car.
It's a Renault Mountaineer, specially designed for the Cretan terrain.
Handles beautifully, we were very pleased with the colour.
Were you, by crikey.
Anyway, I'd studied the map of the roads from Heraklion while having lunch on the plane.
-Did I tell you about lunch on the plane?
-In some detail, as a matter of fact.
Oh, look, here's another one of the lunch tray.
I don't know how that got in there, must have muddled up the order somehow.
I've been sucked into the deepest pit of hell.
Oh, look.
And here's one of the Renault's instrument panel.
Uniquely fascinating.
That's the left-hand control stalk with main beam, wipe wash and hooter on it.
Oh, that's interesting!
And here's one of the right-hand control stalk with indicators and so forth.
Oh, I think this is gonna give me an erection.
Anyway, so we skirted round Souda Bay via Thalakos.
I discovered this marvellous little off-the-beaten-track taverna.
(RETCHING)
It really was so authentic.
Everyone there spoke...
-Really, you should have been there.
-Oh, no.
I shouldn't.
No, I shouldn't have been there.
No.
-This is one of me pointing at my moussaka.
-Oh, wait a second, isn't that a revolting sight?
And this is one of me on the toilet half an hour later.
I used a self-timer for that one because the whole new Minolta range have got self-timers.
Self-timers?
Oh, well, then I must leave at once.
I discovered this marvellous little man in Hadia who developed film the traditional Cretan way.
Nikos his name was, or Costas.
Could have been Andreas.
Oh, but I must find out.
Which?
Which was his name?
-This is him on the toilet.
-Go away!
(SOBBING)
Right.
Well, you touch my daughter again and it'll be a slide show.
You understand?
-Hello.
Both just got time to tell you...
-Just.
Just got time, yes.
We both, well, we both used to have problems around here, didn't we?
-Just around the eye area.
-Certainly did.
-Just there.
-And this area as well.
-Here and round there.
-That's right.
It was awful.
Our eyes just kept coming out, didn't they?
-Couldn't keep them in.
It was horrible.
-Ghastly.
Now, thankfully, it's all cleared up.
-It's stopped happening, hasn't it?
-Effectively, yes.
Yes, yes, they don't fall out anymore and we're pleased about that, aren't we?
-Delighted.
Yes.
-Hmm.
-Officer!
-Good morning, sir.
Would you like to take a seat?
-Is there a queue?
-Well, you may be more comfortable that way.
No.
I'm all right standing up, thanks.
My name's Oliver, by the way.
Excited to know you.
-Oh, Peter Franks.
-Hi, Peter.
Peter, listen would you like a coffee?
Filter, espresso, cappuccino.
We offer decaf on all of those.
Well, that's very kind.
Do you have a tea?
Tea...
I don't think so, Peter.
I'll just check that for you.
Hello, Mabel, my love.
It's Oliver here.
Listen, my darling, do we carry a tea machine?
-Sorry, dear.
-Yes, I thought not.
Many thanks, pet.
-Sorry, Peter, no tea.
-Oh, doesn't matter.
Don't worry.
-So, how may we help you?
-Well, this is a police station, isn't it?
-Well, of course it is, Peter.
Yes.
-Yes. 'Cause I tried to ring you earlier but you must have changed your number, all I got was music playing in my ear.
The thing is, my car's been stolen.
-Your car's been stolen?
-Yes.
Oh, Peter, I am sorry to hear that.
Aw.
And you'd like us to do something about it?
Well, yes, please.
Okay, well, have you had a look at our brochure, Peter?
If you'll pardon the pun.
What pun?
Wasn't there one?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, Peter, if you'd like to come with me, we'll go through it together.
Would you like to take a seat?
Now, Peter, we offer basically three kinds of stolen car recovery service.
That's the super, the lovely and the gorgeous.
Now, the super is a basic non-priority listing of your car.
The lovely is higher priority, and the gorgeous is A1 top priority.
We put all our team onto it, field and creative.
And that also includes a full waxing and valeting
-of your car on recovery.
-I see.
Obviously, Peter, the gorgeous is a more expensive service.
-I beg your pardon?
-Do you have an account with us?
-Account?
No.
-Oh, you're a shareholder, perhaps?
-Well, I'm a citizen, if that's what you mean.
-Citizen.
Oh, you mean client?
Look, I don't want to sound stupid, but I get back to England, I find my car's been stolen...
Peter, you've been away?
Did you perhaps miss the privatisation of the police force?
-The what?
-This is now a branch office of Brit Law PLC.
-Would you like to fill out a form?
-Fill out a form?
Fill out a form?
You mean fill in a form.
Has everyone suddenly turned American?
Now, Peter I shall need your address, I shall need your place and date of birth, your car registration number, and we should be able to have an account verified within 1 4 days.
-Subject to status.
-This is insanity.
I'm a taxpayer.
Peter, everybody had a chance to buy shares at the time of issue.
It was all supervised by a reputable merchant bank.
Well, by a merchant bank anyway.
-This is madness.
I'm leaving.
-No, Peter.
Not that way.
Not that way, Peter.
-What?
-That's the High Street.
-Yes?
-The High Street is owned by UK Highroads PLC.
We're employed by them to make sure that only those with valid roadway passes use the street.
But that's the Queen's highway for goodness sake, surely I can use that.
Queen's...?
Oh, you have shares in the Royal Family PLC.
That would be quite sufficient.
Shares in the...
No, of course I haven't.
Well, Peter, I'm afraid I must ask you to come with me to the restraining bar.
Now, if you'd just like to put your hands on the detention knob.
-But I haven't done anything.
-Not the gold member cuffs for you.
I'm afraid we'll have to use the bronze, Master Peter.
-No, no.
Absolutely...no.
No, I refuse.
No.
-Now, Peter.
Peter.
-Peter?
-What?
Well, you haven't changed that much, then.
Welcome to Argue the Toss.
My tosser this week is Simon Clituris.
Simon Clituris, you saw that sketch.
What did you think?
-Well, I thought the sketch worked on two levels.
-Only two?
Ah.
Yes, you're right.
I'm being simplistic.
I thought it worked on nine levels.
-I thought I spotted 1 2.
-Yes, yes.
Well, yes, 1 2 if you include the...
But, for heaven's sake, let's be condescending about this.
-Absolutely.
-I thought it worked, on the one hand, as a simple satire on modern Britain.
And on the other hand, as a metaphor for the problem of redemption.
-What about the underlying theme?
-Ah.
Which one?
Well, the underlying theme of a man desperately trying to recover his stolen car.
Well, that I thought was the least successful of all the underlying themes.
It didn't work for me.
-That's where the sketch really just disappeared.
-Simply vanished?
-Completely vanished.
-I see.
And the main characters?
Well, I felt I didn't know enough about them.
I was reminded of those occasions when one is asked to sleep with someone one doesn't know particularly well.
Consequently, I was nervous and the whole thing was a disappointment.
-In a word.
-Brilliant.
Simon Clituris, thank you very much.
Welcome to Up the Arts.
Martin Utrecht, you saw those critics there.
-Were you impressed by what they had to say?
-Let me say that it seems to me that what they were trying to achieve was essentially two-fold.
I don't think it would be quite fair to judge them on that small extract we just saw.
Good.
So what was your judgement of the small extract we just saw?
Well, it seems to me that they were trying to assess a comedy sketch, a humouresque routine...
Did that work for you?
For me, there was something about their criticism that was, I don't know, what's the word?
Sterile?
I was going to say fertile.
Hardly different.
No, I have to say it didn't work for me, no.
I think, on the one hand, they were trying to encompass too much.
They were overambitious.
I was going to say overcautious.
Yes.
Hardly different.
And, on the other hand, they were trying to present themselves as viable human beings
-attempting to make sense of their...of their, um...
-Environment?
I was going to say trousers.
Hardly different.
Trousers, environment.
Environment, trousers.
It's a kind of square.
I was gonna say circle.
Much the same thing.
And on the other hand...
Ah, you've got three hands.
-I've got three hands...
-They, of course, were doing a two-hander.
Would they have benefited from an extra hand?
Would that have come in...useful?
I feel with an extra hand, they might just have got away with it.
Did you enjoy their criticism?
Oh, I loved it.
I wanted to go to bed with it and kiss it in many soft, private, little places.
-So their future as critics, bulbous, would you say?
-Yes, perineal.
The exact word.
-So we're agreed?
-Of course not.
Hello, welcome to Oh, No, Not Another One.
(AMERICAN ACCENT) Of all the deodorants, this is the one that I enjoy using most.
It feels real nice going on and it smells good and keeps me dry all day.
I don't have to worry about it cutting out in clutch moments.
All of the other ones are just...
I don't know.
They just never seem to hold up under pressure for me.
I can put this on once during the day and for the rest of the day I'm fine, I'm all set up.
I don't have to worry about, you know, social nervousness or anything.
It's just...
It keeps me feeling good and fresh and I love the smell.
I don't think there's any deodorant that comes close to this one.
I think it was Donald Mainstock, the great amateur squash player, who pointed out how lovely I was.
Until that time, I think it was safe to say that I had never really been aware of my own timeless brand of loveliness.
But his words smote me because, of course you see,
I am lovely in a fluffy moist kind of a way and who would have it otherwise?
I walk, let's be splendid about this, in a lightly accented cloud of gorgeousness that isn't far short of being, quite simply, terrific.
The secret of smooth almost shiny loveliness of the order of which we're discussing in this simple, frank, creamy soft way doesn't reside in oils, unguents, balms, ointments, creams, astringents, milks, moisturisers,
liniments, lubricants, embrocations or balsams, to be rather divine for just one noble moment.
It resides, and I mean this in a pink, slightly special way, in one's attitude of mind.
To be gorgeous and high and true and fine and fluffy and moist and sticky and lovely, all you have to do is to believe that one is gorgeous and high and true and fine and fluffy and moist and sticky and lovely.
And I believe it of myself, tremulously at first, and then with mounting heat and passion because, stopping off for a second to be super again, I'm so often told it.
That's the secret really.
Waiter.
-Sir?
-There's something wrong with my soup.
Oh, I wouldn't say that, sir.
It looks very smart to me.
What?
Nice pinstripe.
No, no.
No, my soup.
There's something wrong with my soup.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I thought you said suit.
It, um, tastes...odd, somehow.
-What does?
-My soup.
-Does it?
-Hmm.
-May I, sir?
-Please do.
Thank you.
-Seems all right to me.
-No.
No, my soup.
My soup tastes odd.
-Oh, your soup!
-Yes.
-Oh, dear!
-Taste it.
I just have, sir.
Not my suit.
I want you to try my soup.
Oh, I'd rather not if you don't mind, sir.
-Why not?
-Probably too long in the arms.
No, no, no.
What's the matter with you?
I'm talking about my soup.
S-O-U-P.
-Oh, your soup!
-Yes!
-Is there something wrong with it, sir?
-Well, I've told you.
It tastes odd.
-Well, may I, sir?
-Please.
Thank you so much.
-Ah, yes.
-"Ah, yes" what?
It's the cyanide, sir.
I beg your pardon?
Chef does occasionally, in my opinion, tend to overstress the cyanide in his pottage.
Are you telling me that the chef has put cyanide in the soup?
No, sir, he's put cyanide in the soup.
-That's what I said.
-Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I thought you said suit.
This is outrageous!
Would you like me to bring you some soup without cyanide in it, sir?
-Yeah.
No, I mean...
-Or perhaps something else from the menu?
Well, why?
Why has the chef put cyanide in the soup?
He has a club foot, sir.
-What?
-The chef has a club foot.
Well, I've got a bent nose but I don't go around massacring perfectly innocent diners.
-There's no cyanide in the mozzarella salad, sir.
-Oh, yippee.
Just a hint of strychnine but not so as you'd notice.
Oh, this is absurd.
You're right.
It is completely ridiculous.
Well, would you like to be a comedy writer?
What's happened is that we've deliberately left this sketch without a tagging punch line.
Or ending, as we call it in the trade.
That's right.
Now, that's where you come in.
The lines are now open for you to phone in your payoff to this hilarious skitlet.
But just as an added difficulty, we're not actually going to give you the telephone number to ring.
No, that's right.
You have to use your skill and judgement to think up a witty, apt and amusing telephone number of your own.
And if British Telecom think it's funny enough, they'll put you through to our switchboard here.
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello.
And we have a clear winner straightaway.
Mr JD Ward of Basildon.
Well, well done, JD Ward.
If you'll be so kind as to let us know your chest size, we'll send you a A Bit of Fry Laurie chequebook and pen straightaway.
-Well, let's go back to where we were, then.
-Right.
Oh, this is absurd.
You're right.
It is completely ridiculous.
The brown soup has no cyanide in it whatsoever, sir.
-The brown soup?
-That's right, sir.
No toxics, radioactive particles or microbes of any description?
Not a drop, sir.
-I'll have some of that, then.
-Right you are, sir.
Honestly.
Nice one, JD.
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
Mr Hugh Laurie has kindly agreed to embarrass us all with a song of his own composing entitled, quite simply, Mystery.
Mr Hugh Laurie.
Mystery.
# Mystery
# All my life has been a mystery
# You and I were never ever meant to be
# That's why I call my love for you a mystery
# Different country
# You and I have always lived in a different country
# And I know that airline tickets don't grow on a tree
# So what kept us apart is plain for me to see
# That much at least is not really a mystery
# Estuary
# I live in a houseboat on an estuary
# Which is handy for my work with the Thames Water Authority
# But I know you would have found it insanitary
# Insanitary
# Taken a violent dislike to me
# I'd be foolish to ignore the possibility
# That if we'd ever actually met you might have hated me
# Still, that's not the only problem that I can see
# Dead since 1 973
# You've been dead now
# Wait a minute, let me see
# Fifteen years come next January
# As a human being, you are history
# So why do I still long for you?
# Why is my love so strong for you?
# Why did I write this song for you?
# Well, I guess it's just a mystery
# Mystery #
Mr Marsh?
Mmm-hmm.
Would you like me to take your bags up to your executive suite, Mr Marsh?
Oh, no, thanks very much.
I'm gonna be checking out in the morning... (LAUGHING)
Gordon Inglis, as I live and close a sale, you crazy old buffalo.
-What the hell are you doing here?
-Oh, Stuart Marsh, you turbo-charged son of a mass retailer.
How are you?
Well, I'm hanging pretty tough, Gordon.
Hanging pretty tough.
What about yourself?
Things not going so well, eh?
Oh, no.
I'm strictly moving to the rhythm, Stu.
Why do you ask?
Why do I ask?
Well, Gordon, really.
I mean, being a porter in a hotel, it's hardly the big time, is it?
No...
Stuart, that was a joke.
Oh, well, then!
Blimey, that's nice.
I like that very much.
Yeah, very good.
So tell me, you old roister-doister, what the hell are you doing in Telford?
The last I heard you were based out of Peterborough.
Yeah, I did a spell in Peterborough, Gordon.
It's part of a big new management shake up, but right now I'm fixing up to meet with old Derek Clark.
Derek "the Fiddler" Clark?
# If I was a rich man #
The man's a legend.
So tell me, you're gonna be working under Derek Clark now, is that it?
Well, not so much under, Gordon, more kind of alongside.
I'm gonna be a sort of flexible, highly-resourced, independently-targeted, free-range trouble-shooter, if you like.
Free-range?
Sounds challenging.
Anyway, he and I are supposed to be having a working breakfast together.
I'd ask you to join us, Gordon, but, you know...
Oh, no Sweatsville, Idaho, Stu.
So tell me, do they do a good working breakfast here?
I don't believe I've ever actually working-breakfasted at this hotel before.
They only do the best working breakfast in the state of Telford, Gordon.
Waiter.
Gordon, you'll take some coffee, surely.
Well, I don't know.
How does the coffee perform?
Oh, the coffee performs okay, Gordon.
Don't you worry about that.
Waiter, pot of coffee for two.
Make sure it's hot, strong and in a pot.
Okay?
For two.
If you see Mr Clark, tell him I'm in the executive breakfast lounge, will you?
How will I know Mr Clark, sir?
I beg your pardon.
How will I recognise Mr Clark?
Are you trying to be funny?
Derek Clark, he's...
You know, his lapel badge.
He's with Unitec.
-Lapel badge!
-Yes, sir.
And he's to meet you in the breakfast lounge.
In the executive breakfast lounge.
-There's only one breakfast lounge, sir.
-Yes, and it's the executive breakfast lounge!
Right.
I'll tell him, sir.
Hey, sonny.
Come here.
If you've got any thoughts about making it in the hotel business, then you better just watch your lip, okay?
That's all.
-I'm sorry...
-That's all.
Thank you.
That's all.
Thank you very much, waiter!
That is all.
The kid's just green, Stu.
Oh, Gordon, when you and I were green... we didn't go around giving lip to busy senior executives.
No, we used to give them a bit of tongue from time to time.
-So, looks like Derek Clark stood you up.
-No, it's all right.
He rang down and said he was having a bit of trouble with the trouser press in his room.
It's an executive trouser press, you see.
Derek tried to put an ordinary leisure trouser on it and, not surprisingly, the machine wouldn't play.
-What a son of a bitch.
-Yeah.
So what about yourself, Gordon.
What's keeping you off the streets these days?
Well, actually, I've gone into business for myself, Stuart.
Yeah?
I hope you're taking good advice.
The very best.
I've got hold of a new kind of bank account.
It's called...
Smug.
I wish you the very best of luck, Gordon.
I really do, because you and I, hey, we go all the way back.
Oh, right the way back to the end zone, Stu.
You know what they used to call us back in Reading?
-What was that?
-The wild dogs of retailing.
-Wild dogs.
-Yeah.
Yeah.
You and I, we broke a few moulds in our time, eh, Gordon?
-Yeah, and a few eggs.
-Yeah.
-Eggs?
-You can't make an omelette...
-Yes, I can.
-No, you can't.
-Yes, I can.
-Not without breaking eggs.
So what if I can't, Gordon?
I mean, I'm a busy man.
My talents lie in other directions.
No, no.
I mean, you can't make an omelette without breaking eggs.
What is this, Cookery Corner?
I don't need this, Gordon, all right?
I'm about to have a working breakfast with the toughest divisional sales manager since Moses and all of a sudden you're giving me a list of all the things I can't do!
Thanks for the support, partner.
-No, Stu, I only meant...
-What am I supposed to say?
"Derek, I'm not right for this job, choose someone else.
I can't make an omelette."
-No, you can, Stu.
But not without...
-It's delegation, Gordon.
I don't have the time.
I want an omelette, I go to an omelette-maker.
Does that make me a failure?
All right, I'm a failure.
I can't make an omelette without breaking eggs.
Well, no one can, Stu.
That's the point.
It's impossible.
-What do you mean, it's impossible?
-It can't be done.
What do you think I've been eating all these years?
I had an omelette last night.
Yeah, but they broke the eggs.
I hardly think they'd use broken eggs in executive room service, Gordon.
Do you know what I'd like to know?
-Have you told me before?
-No.
Then how can I possibly?
I'd like to know why, oh, why, oh, why the word gay has been so ruthlessly hijacked from our beloved English language.
I agree with your question 1 00%.
-Gay used to be such a lovely word.
-A lovely word.
Yes.
You can't use it anymore.
It's been taken away from us.
That's right.
No longer can ordinary people, such as we, use an ordinary word, like gay, in an ordinary example of the great British sentence.
Without people thinking that you mean poofy.
It's a disgrace.
Damn shame.
And there's another one, you see?
Poofy.
You can't say that anymore.
-Of course you can't.
-Used to.
-All the time.
-Yes, but now...
-Now.
-...people think you mean arse bandit.
Arse bandit.
There you go again, you see?
-Well, of course you do.
-You know, arse bandit.
-Perfectly decent couple of words.
-That's right.
-Used to use them every day.
-So did I.
"Would you care to have a go on the arse bandit?" One used to ask, quite innocently.
Yes.
Yes, or, "Back in a moment, darling.
I'm just taking the arse bandit to the menders."
Yeah.
-But now, of course...
-Nowadays.
-...people think you mean homosexual.
-Right.
-And there's another one.
-Yeah.
When was the last time you could use the word homosexual in its proper context?
-Right, and it's such a lovely word.
-Oh, it's one of the great words.
"My word, Jane," I used to say to my wife, "the garden's looking very homosexual this morning."
Quite right.
Quite right.
Lovely word.
One of the great words.
Always were.
"Landlord, I'll have two foaming pints of your most homosexual beer, thank you."
"Oh, and a packet of arse bandits as well."
Right.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes. "And keep the change."
-Right.
-Yes.
-But now...
-Nowadays.
-People just laugh at you.
-That's right.
Oh, well, I'm off to the dry-cleaner's to pick up a couple of screaming benders.
-Are you coming?
-I don't see why not.
Then we can get them home and go to bed with them.
-That's right.
-That's right.
Morning.
You're ugly.
No.
Um...
We're not...
We're not doing that one.
No.
If you remember, I didn't like it.
I thought that was quite funny, that one.
-Yes.
Yes, we'll be doing this one instead.
-Right.
All right then.
Right.
Huh.
I can see you've fallen in love already, sir.
-Oh, hello.
Yes, I was just looking at the...
-The Aston Martin.
Isn't she beautiful?
To be honest with you, that's the best car in the place, that one.
Out of all of them, that is the best one in the place.
Only come in Tuesday, as a matter of fact.
Obviously it's not for me.
It's for my nephew.
-It's his birthday tomorrow.
He'll be nine.
-Yeah, that's nice.
And he told me he's set his heart on an Aston Martin so...
Yeah, well, you know, who wouldn't?
To be honest with you, if I had the money, that is the one I would...
You know, for my own personal use, I would choose that one.
-You can have a go on it if you want.
-Really?
Yeah, sure.
I'll get it out for you.
(IMITATING CAR ENGINE)
-Goes a bit, doesn't it?
-Yeah.
(IMITATING CAR ENGINE)
Sounds a bit rough to me.
Yeah, that's 'cause you're not getting your tongue far enough back in your throat.
That's why.
-Like that, you see?
-Oh, right.
Yeah.
Oh, yes.
Good.
So how much is it?
The Aston Martin DB6 Plantagenet silver.
Oh, that's £4.
-£4?
-Yeah.
And it's one owner.
Immaculate history.
It's not new, then?
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
No, you won't get a new Aston for £4.
That is cheap.
That is a good price.
For an Aston, £4 is cheap.
I'm telling you.
Obviously, we make sure that the vehicle is completely immaculate before it goes out of here.
We do a complete five-point check on the vehicle.
We clean and polish it... and then we do the other four things that are included in the five-point check.
Basically, we do everything that is humanely possible to the car.
Look, if you're not sure, you know, why not bring your nephew in?
You know, if he knows about Astons.
Maybe he'd like to have a look underneath it.
We can have a look underneath it now if you want.
-Clean.
Yeah.
-It is clean.
It is clean.
Yes.
Do you exchange?
-Well, what's he got at the moment?
-A tractor.
Well, I'll be lucky to shift a tractor by new year.
Maybe 40p.
He is very fond of his tractor.
All right, then.
It's his birthday.
You're an ugly bastard. 50p.
I'd just like to tell you about this cigarette case.
It used to belong to my grandfather on my parents' side.
He was given it by his god-niece as a kind of loss of virginity present, really.
He took it with him to Flanders in 1 91 2 when he went there on holiday.
Then he took it again in 1 91 5 when he went to fight in the war.
Now, what grandfather used to do is he would keep cigarettes in it like this.
And if he wanted one, he would simply take it out, smoke it and close the case again.
Now, he used to keep his cigarette case here, in the breast pocket of his field tunic, or battle blouse.
Now, one day grandfather had to go over the top, out of the trenches into action and he was shot by a German sniper clean through the temple.
Now, if grandfather had worn his cigarette case here... um... it would have an unpleasant dent in it... and I'd be alive today.
Oh, that's...
That's brilliant, that is.
That's fantastic.
What?
The wars are funny now, are they?
The First World War was just a joke to you, I suppose, was it?
Well, yes, not very well-told.
Oh, right, so the Great War and World War II were just vast entertainments laid on for your benefit, were they?
Well, if you put it that way, then obviously yes.
Do you know, I wonder, what it's like to die?
-Erm...no, I don't, actually.
-No, right.
But do you think it's funny that millions of people died for you?
I don't think millions of people did die for me.
They didn't know me.
I wasn't born.
They happened to be dying for generations yet unborn,
-which I think includes you.
-Yes, but they didn't know that, did they?
They didn't go into battle shouting,
"Let's die for Stephen Fry who may or may not be born one day."
-They were just obeying orders.
-Oh, forget it.
Forget it.
Sick, you are.
Sick.
Well, I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
I mean, the fact is I am sick.
But I don't think even Hugh knows quite how sick I am.
The fact is, and this is something only Hugh's closest friends are aware of, that he has been suffering now for sometime from a gradual but persistent deterioration in his eyesight.
Normally, it's absolutely fine.
No one would ever know.
He learns the position of all the furniture, all the props on stage and no one could ever guess.
But today, so sick am I, I just went out this morning and moved everything here just...
Oh, dear.
I'm sorry.
It was sick of me.
As you can see, he's completely disoriented.
I don't know...
I don't know why I did it.
I'm sorry.
It was sick of me.
-All right.
Come on, let's get on with it.
-Sorry.
On with the sketch.
Soldiers are...
Now, I don't know how to tell you this so I'm going to have to come straight out with it.
-I'm afraid I can't let you go on the escape.
-I'm sorry, sir?
-I can't let you go on the escape.
-Well, why not, sir?
Because, Whitlow, because you're blind.
That's why not.
-No, I'm not, sir.
-You're blind, Whitlow, and I can't jeopardise the lives of 1 4 other prisoners just because one of the members of the escape party happens to be blind.
-Pardon, sir?
-I said, I can't...
-What's the matter?
Are you deaf?
-Yes, sir.
-You're deaf and blind?
-No, just deaf, sir.
No, you're blind as well, Whitlow.
You keep bumping into things.
Oh, that!
Oh, well, that's just a joke, sir.
It's not very funny, is it?
Well, the chaps like it, sir.
-If you'll pardon the pun.
-What pun?
-Wasn't there a pun?
Oh, I'm sorry.
-No.
All right, you claim you can see.
I have here, Whitlow, an electric carving knife.
I'm going to plug it in, switch it on and throw it at you.
If you don't drop it, I'll let you go on the escape.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that, sir.
I haven't thrown it yet.
Actually, I was telling a bit of a lie just now.
-Ah, you mean you're not deaf?
-No, I mean I am blind.
-You're blind and deaf?
-Pardon?
Well, I can't very well let you go on the escape if you're deaf and blind, now can I?
It was a forlorn hope, sir, yes.
Just a moment.
If you're deaf, how can you hear what I'm saying?
-I can lip-read, sir.
-Ah, I see.
Lip-read?
-But you're blind!
-Pardon?
How can you read my lips if you're blind?
Oh, well, it's because I'm deaf, sir, that my sense of vision is naturally enhanced.
Blind people are known to have very keen hearing.
So they sort of cancel each other out, sir.
-You mean you can see and hear perfectly?
-Yes, because I'm blind and deaf.
One miraculously compensates for the other.
You poor beggar, but I still can't let you go on the escape.
It's because I'm dumb, isn't it, sir?
-It's a talker's world.
-What are you talking about?
-If you can't talk, you're nobody, nothing.
A zero.
-Whitlow, shut up.
They think it means I'm stupid, but I've got ideas...
Be quiet, Whitlow.
You're not coming on this escape.
If it's because I can't smell, sir.
You are not coming on this escape and that is final.
But, sir, I lost my sense of smell while forging the minutest details of a thousand Nazi documents.
I know that, Whitlow, but you can't come because you're a bastard and we hate you.
-We don't want you to come.
-Oh, fair enough, sir.
Oh, hi, Bradley.
I just looked in to see if I couldn't have a borrow of your garden sprinklie.
Oh, sure, mate.
Help yourself.
It's over there in the coolie.
Thanks, mate.
By the way, how are Javelina and Trevelin these days?
Jings, mate, don't reopen old wounds.
Was I doing that, Craig?
Was I reopening old wounds?
-Old sores?
-You certainly were.
Listen, Shane, a word to the wise.
If you wanna re-establish your relationship with those two, you've got to stop running away from yourself.
Jings, mate, don't you think I know that?
Don't you think I've tried not running away from myself?
It seems like every time I look out the window, there I go haring down the street.
-Away from yourself?
-Away from myself, precisely.
How does Donna feel about this?
Owen, I'm gonna ask you man to man, leave Donna out of this.
All right, I'm sorry.
Keep your sweat on.
It's okay, mate.
It's just that ever since Morwenna's graphic design studio went down the tubes,
I just seem to have withdrawn right into myself.
Oh, heck, Findley.
You can't blame yourself for that.
Sean over-capitalised.
You warned him time and time enough.
Yeah, but performance is the bottom line, Clark, and I hold myself accountable in no small measure.
Well, how do you think I feel, Declan, for crike's sakes, eh?
I personally underwrote the equity on Yvonne's marital boutique.
It's my ass on the bottom line, too, you know.
Listen, you leave Yvonne out of this, all right?
Jings, mate, I'm sorry.
God, it's pretty stuffy in here.
Why don't we get some fresh air?
Sure, mate, help yourself.
There's some air freshener in the dunnie over there.
Oh, by the way, I know what it was I wanted to say to you.
We're having a barbie tomorrow night.
Do you want to come along?
You leave Barbie out of this!
No, a barbecue.
It's to celebrate the opening of Morkwinda's new executive fitness centre and garage.
-Do you want to come?
-Sounds great.
Okay, then.
-Oh, Jims!
-What?
I've just seen Joycie coming up the pathie.
Oh, Jims!
Listen, there's something I've been discussing with Castella and Lilette.
And I'd rather that, you know, Joycie and Lenore didn't find out about it.
What?
Spit it out, mate, she's almost here.
Look, I don't know how to tell you this, mate.
It's hard for me to say.
The fact is...
I've been having, well, affair, it's the only word.
I've been having an affair with you for sometime now.
-What?
-It's true.
You bastard!
Look, mate, you had to find out sooner or later and I'd just rather it came from me, that's all.
You mean we've been sleeping together all this time?
Behind my back?
I've said I'm sorry.
I don't know what else I can say.
The fact is that...
I was vulnerable and you were there.
You leave me out of this!
I've said I'm sorry.
I just don't know what else I can say, mate.
Why am I always the last one to know?
It won't happen again, Vin.
I promise.
I just wish that if you were gonna sleep with me, you could at least have done it to my face.
I'll bear that in mind for next time.
The truth is, mate, I was confused and slightly bewildered.
I'd just discovered that Durnik isn't my real father.
He isn't!
Well, then who is?
I am.
-Then that must mean that you must be...
-Exactly.
Devlin's half-sister's wife's doctor's cousin's niece.
Well, then who the hell am I?
I don't know, mate, but it's your round.
AGENT 1 :
Okay, stand by, everybody.
Tangos One and Two have now entered the Arrivals Hall.
AGENT 2:
Which has the case, please?
AGENT 1 :
Tango One has the case at this stage.
AGENT 2:
Right, hold on Tango One, then, please.
AGENT 1 :
Oh, there's been a changeover.
Tango One has passed the case to Tango Two.
And Tango Two doesn't want it, he's given it back.
AGENT 2:
What?
Are you sure that is Tango Two?
AGENT 1 :
Well, I thought it was Tango Two.
Whoever he is, he didn't...
Oh, no, it's Tango Two all right.
He just doesn't want the case.
Well, neither of them wants the case now.
AGENT 2:
Well, who has the case?
AGENT 1 :
Tango One.
Well, they're looking around now.
I think they may...
They may just be beginning to get a little bit suspicious now.
I think they may have sensed the camera.
AGENT 2:
Have they rumbled our position?
AGENT 1 :
I think they've rumbled our position.
AGENT 2:
Well, pull out, pull out.
All units, trouser, trouser, trouser.
All units, trouser, trouser, trouser.
Pull out.
Anyway, the hire car was absolutely ready and waiting when we arrived at Heraklion airport.
We'd done a deal with Hertz, through Amex, which meant we were able to upgrade the category without paying the extra price differential.
This is one of the Hertz girl, Tonya, with the car.
It's a Renault Mountaineer, specially designed for the Cretan terrain.
Handles beautifully, we were very pleased with the colour.
Were you, by crikey.
Anyway, I'd studied the map of the roads from Heraklion while having lunch on the plane.
-Did I tell you about lunch on the plane?
-In some detail, as a matter of fact.
Oh, look, here's another one of the lunch tray.
I don't know how that got in there, must have muddled up the order somehow.
I've been sucked into the deepest pit of hell.
Oh, look.
And here's one of the Renault's instrument panel.
Uniquely fascinating.
That's the left-hand control stalk with main beam, wipe wash and hooter on it.
Oh, that's interesting!
And here's one of the right-hand control stalk with indicators and so forth.
Oh, I think this is gonna give me an erection.
Anyway, so we skirted round Souda Bay via Thalakos.
I discovered this marvellous little off-the-beaten-track taverna.
(RETCHING)
It really was so authentic.
Everyone there spoke...
-Really, you should have been there.
-Oh, no.
I shouldn't.
No, I shouldn't have been there.
No.
-This is one of me pointing at my moussaka.
-Oh, wait a second, isn't that a revolting sight?
And this is one of me on the toilet half an hour later.
I used a self-timer for that one because the whole new Minolta range have got self-timers.
Self-timers?
Oh, well, then I must leave at once.
I discovered this marvellous little man in Hadia who developed film the traditional Cretan way.
Nikos his name was, or Costas.
Could have been Andreas.
Oh, but I must find out.
Which?
Which was his name?
-This is him on the toilet.
-Go away!
(SOBBING)
Right.
Well, you touch my daughter again and it'll be a slide show.
You understand?
-Hello.
Both just got time to tell you...
-Just.
Just got time, yes.
We both, well, we both used to have problems around here, didn't we?
-Just around the eye area.
-Certainly did.
-Just there.
-And this area as well.
-Here and round there.
-That's right.
It was awful.
Our eyes just kept coming out, didn't they?
-Couldn't keep them in.
It was horrible.
-Ghastly.
Now, thankfully, it's all cleared up.
-It's stopped happening, hasn't it?
-Effectively, yes.
Yes, yes, they don't fall out anymore and we're pleased about that, aren't we?
-Delighted.
Yes.
-Hmm.
-Officer!
-Good morning, sir.
Would you like to take a seat?
-Is there a queue?
-Well, you may be more comfortable that way.
No.
I'm all right standing up, thanks.
My name's Oliver, by the way.
Excited to know you.
-Oh, Peter Franks.
-Hi, Peter.
Peter, listen would you like a coffee?
Filter, espresso, cappuccino.
We offer decaf on all of those.
Well, that's very kind.
Do you have a tea?
Tea...
I don't think so, Peter.
I'll just check that for you.
Hello, Mabel, my love.
It's Oliver here.
Listen, my darling, do we carry a tea machine?
-Sorry, dear.
-Yes, I thought not.
Many thanks, pet.
-Sorry, Peter, no tea.
-Oh, doesn't matter.
Don't worry.
-So, how may we help you?
-Well, this is a police station, isn't it?
-Well, of course it is, Peter.
Yes.
-Yes. 'Cause I tried to ring you earlier but you must have changed your number, all I got was music playing in my ear.
The thing is, my car's been stolen.
-Your car's been stolen?
-Yes.
Oh, Peter, I am sorry to hear that.
Aw.
And you'd like us to do something about it?
Well, yes, please.
Okay, well, have you had a look at our brochure, Peter?
If you'll pardon the pun.
What pun?
Wasn't there one?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, Peter, if you'd like to come with me, we'll go through it together.
Would you like to take a seat?
Now, Peter, we offer basically three kinds of stolen car recovery service.
That's the super, the lovely and the gorgeous.
Now, the super is a basic non-priority listing of your car.
The lovely is higher priority, and the gorgeous is A1 top priority.
We put all our team onto it, field and creative.
And that also includes a full waxing and valeting
-of your car on recovery.
-I see.
Obviously, Peter, the gorgeous is a more expensive service.
-I beg your pardon?
-Do you have an account with us?
-Account?
No.
-Oh, you're a shareholder, perhaps?
-Well, I'm a citizen, if that's what you mean.
-Citizen.
Oh, you mean client?
Look, I don't want to sound stupid, but I get back to England, I find my car's been stolen...
Peter, you've been away?
Did you perhaps miss the privatisation of the police force?
-The what?
-This is now a branch office of Brit Law PLC.
-Would you like to fill out a form?
-Fill out a form?
Fill out a form?
You mean fill in a form.
Has everyone suddenly turned American?
Now, Peter I shall need your address, I shall need your place and date of birth, your car registration number, and we should be able to have an account verified within 1 4 days.
-Subject to status.
-This is insanity.
I'm a taxpayer.
Peter, everybody had a chance to buy shares at the time of issue.
It was all supervised by a reputable merchant bank.
Well, by a merchant bank anyway.
-This is madness.
I'm leaving.
-No, Peter.
Not that way.
Not that way, Peter.
-What?
-That's the High Street.
-Yes?
-The High Street is owned by UK Highroads PLC.
We're employed by them to make sure that only those with valid roadway passes use the street.
But that's the Queen's highway for goodness sake, surely I can use that.
Queen's...?
Oh, you have shares in the Royal Family PLC.
That would be quite sufficient.
Shares in the...
No, of course I haven't.
Well, Peter, I'm afraid I must ask you to come with me to the restraining bar.
Now, if you'd just like to put your hands on the detention knob.
-But I haven't done anything.
-Not the gold member cuffs for you.
I'm afraid we'll have to use the bronze, Master Peter.
-No, no.
Absolutely...no.
No, I refuse.
No.
-Now, Peter.
Peter.
-Peter?
-What?
Well, you haven't changed that much, then.
Welcome to Argue the Toss.
My tosser this week is Simon Clituris.
Simon Clituris, you saw that sketch.
What did you think?
-Well, I thought the sketch worked on two levels.
-Only two?
Ah.
Yes, you're right.
I'm being simplistic.
I thought it worked on nine levels.
-I thought I spotted 1 2.
-Yes, yes.
Well, yes, 1 2 if you include the...
But, for heaven's sake, let's be condescending about this.
-Absolutely.
-I thought it worked, on the one hand, as a simple satire on modern Britain.
And on the other hand, as a metaphor for the problem of redemption.
-What about the underlying theme?
-Ah.
Which one?
Well, the underlying theme of a man desperately trying to recover his stolen car.
Well, that I thought was the least successful of all the underlying themes.
It didn't work for me.
-That's where the sketch really just disappeared.
-Simply vanished?
-Completely vanished.
-I see.
And the main characters?
Well, I felt I didn't know enough about them.
I was reminded of those occasions when one is asked to sleep with someone one doesn't know particularly well.
Consequently, I was nervous and the whole thing was a disappointment.
-In a word.
-Brilliant.
Simon Clituris, thank you very much.
Welcome to Up the Arts.
Martin Utrecht, you saw those critics there.
-Were you impressed by what they had to say?
-Let me say that it seems to me that what they were trying to achieve was essentially two-fold.
I don't think it would be quite fair to judge them on that small extract we just saw.
Good.
So what was your judgement of the small extract we just saw?
Well, it seems to me that they were trying to assess a comedy sketch, a humouresque routine...
Did that work for you?
For me, there was something about their criticism that was, I don't know, what's the word?
Sterile?
I was going to say fertile.
Hardly different.
No, I have to say it didn't work for me, no.
I think, on the one hand, they were trying to encompass too much.
They were overambitious.
I was going to say overcautious.
Yes.
Hardly different.
And, on the other hand, they were trying to present themselves as viable human beings
-attempting to make sense of their...of their, um...
-Environment?
I was going to say trousers.
Hardly different.
Trousers, environment.
Environment, trousers.
It's a kind of square.
I was gonna say circle.
Much the same thing.
And on the other hand...
Ah, you've got three hands.
-I've got three hands...
-They, of course, were doing a two-hander.
Would they have benefited from an extra hand?
Would that have come in...useful?
I feel with an extra hand, they might just have got away with it.
Did you enjoy their criticism?
Oh, I loved it.
I wanted to go to bed with it and kiss it in many soft, private, little places.
-So their future as critics, bulbous, would you say?
-Yes, perineal.
The exact word.
-So we're agreed?
-Of course not.
Hello, welcome to Oh, No, Not Another One.
(AMERICAN ACCENT) Of all the deodorants, this is the one that I enjoy using most.
It feels real nice going on and it smells good and keeps me dry all day.
I don't have to worry about it cutting out in clutch moments.
All of the other ones are just...
I don't know.
They just never seem to hold up under pressure for me.
I can put this on once during the day and for the rest of the day I'm fine, I'm all set up.
I don't have to worry about, you know, social nervousness or anything.
It's just...
It keeps me feeling good and fresh and I love the smell.
I don't think there's any deodorant that comes close to this one.
I think it was Donald Mainstock, the great amateur squash player, who pointed out how lovely I was.
Until that time, I think it was safe to say that I had never really been aware of my own timeless brand of loveliness.
But his words smote me because, of course you see,
I am lovely in a fluffy moist kind of a way and who would have it otherwise?
I walk, let's be splendid about this, in a lightly accented cloud of gorgeousness that isn't far short of being, quite simply, terrific.
The secret of smooth almost shiny loveliness of the order of which we're discussing in this simple, frank, creamy soft way doesn't reside in oils, unguents, balms, ointments, creams, astringents, milks, moisturisers,
liniments, lubricants, embrocations or balsams, to be rather divine for just one noble moment.
It resides, and I mean this in a pink, slightly special way, in one's attitude of mind.
To be gorgeous and high and true and fine and fluffy and moist and sticky and lovely, all you have to do is to believe that one is gorgeous and high and true and fine and fluffy and moist and sticky and lovely.
And I believe it of myself, tremulously at first, and then with mounting heat and passion because, stopping off for a second to be super again, I'm so often told it.
That's the secret really.
Waiter.
-Sir?
-There's something wrong with my soup.
Oh, I wouldn't say that, sir.
It looks very smart to me.
What?
Nice pinstripe.
No, no.
No, my soup.
There's something wrong with my soup.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I thought you said suit.
It, um, tastes...odd, somehow.
-What does?
-My soup.
-Does it?
-Hmm.
-May I, sir?
-Please do.
Thank you.
-Seems all right to me.
-No.
No, my soup.
My soup tastes odd.
-Oh, your soup!
-Yes.
-Oh, dear!
-Taste it.
I just have, sir.
Not my suit.
I want you to try my soup.
Oh, I'd rather not if you don't mind, sir.
-Why not?
-Probably too long in the arms.
No, no, no.
What's the matter with you?
I'm talking about my soup.
S-O-U-P.
-Oh, your soup!
-Yes!
-Is there something wrong with it, sir?
-Well, I've told you.
It tastes odd.
-Well, may I, sir?
-Please.
Thank you so much.
-Ah, yes.
-"Ah, yes" what?
It's the cyanide, sir.
I beg your pardon?
Chef does occasionally, in my opinion, tend to overstress the cyanide in his pottage.
Are you telling me that the chef has put cyanide in the soup?
No, sir, he's put cyanide in the soup.
-That's what I said.
-Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I thought you said suit.
This is outrageous!
Would you like me to bring you some soup without cyanide in it, sir?
-Yeah.
No, I mean...
-Or perhaps something else from the menu?
Well, why?
Why has the chef put cyanide in the soup?
He has a club foot, sir.
-What?
-The chef has a club foot.
Well, I've got a bent nose but I don't go around massacring perfectly innocent diners.
-There's no cyanide in the mozzarella salad, sir.
-Oh, yippee.
Just a hint of strychnine but not so as you'd notice.
Oh, this is absurd.
You're right.
It is completely ridiculous.
Well, would you like to be a comedy writer?
What's happened is that we've deliberately left this sketch without a tagging punch line.
Or ending, as we call it in the trade.
That's right.
Now, that's where you come in.
The lines are now open for you to phone in your payoff to this hilarious skitlet.
But just as an added difficulty, we're not actually going to give you the telephone number to ring.
No, that's right.
You have to use your skill and judgement to think up a witty, apt and amusing telephone number of your own.
And if British Telecom think it's funny enough, they'll put you through to our switchboard here.
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello.
And we have a clear winner straightaway.
Mr JD Ward of Basildon.
Well, well done, JD Ward.
If you'll be so kind as to let us know your chest size, we'll send you a A Bit of Fry Laurie chequebook and pen straightaway.
-Well, let's go back to where we were, then.
-Right.
Oh, this is absurd.
You're right.
It is completely ridiculous.
The brown soup has no cyanide in it whatsoever, sir.
-The brown soup?
-That's right, sir.
No toxics, radioactive particles or microbes of any description?
Not a drop, sir.
-I'll have some of that, then.
-Right you are, sir.
Honestly.
Nice one, JD.
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
Mr Hugh Laurie has kindly agreed to embarrass us all with a song of his own composing entitled, quite simply, Mystery.
Mr Hugh Laurie.
Mystery.
# Mystery
# All my life has been a mystery
# You and I were never ever meant to be
# That's why I call my love for you a mystery
# Different country
# You and I have always lived in a different country
# And I know that airline tickets don't grow on a tree
# So what kept us apart is plain for me to see
# That much at least is not really a mystery
# Estuary
# I live in a houseboat on an estuary
# Which is handy for my work with the Thames Water Authority
# But I know you would have found it insanitary
# Insanitary
# Taken a violent dislike to me
# I'd be foolish to ignore the possibility
# That if we'd ever actually met you might have hated me
# Still, that's not the only problem that I can see
# Dead since 1 973
# You've been dead now
# Wait a minute, let me see
# Fifteen years come next January
# As a human being, you are history
# So why do I still long for you?
# Why is my love so strong for you?
# Why did I write this song for you?
# Well, I guess it's just a mystery
# Mystery #
Mr Marsh?
Mmm-hmm.
Would you like me to take your bags up to your executive suite, Mr Marsh?
Oh, no, thanks very much.
I'm gonna be checking out in the morning... (LAUGHING)
Gordon Inglis, as I live and close a sale, you crazy old buffalo.
-What the hell are you doing here?
-Oh, Stuart Marsh, you turbo-charged son of a mass retailer.
How are you?
Well, I'm hanging pretty tough, Gordon.
Hanging pretty tough.
What about yourself?
Things not going so well, eh?
Oh, no.
I'm strictly moving to the rhythm, Stu.
Why do you ask?
Why do I ask?
Well, Gordon, really.
I mean, being a porter in a hotel, it's hardly the big time, is it?
No...
Stuart, that was a joke.
Oh, well, then!
Blimey, that's nice.
I like that very much.
Yeah, very good.
So tell me, you old roister-doister, what the hell are you doing in Telford?
The last I heard you were based out of Peterborough.
Yeah, I did a spell in Peterborough, Gordon.
It's part of a big new management shake up, but right now I'm fixing up to meet with old Derek Clark.
Derek "the Fiddler" Clark?
# If I was a rich man #
The man's a legend.
So tell me, you're gonna be working under Derek Clark now, is that it?
Well, not so much under, Gordon, more kind of alongside.
I'm gonna be a sort of flexible, highly-resourced, independently-targeted, free-range trouble-shooter, if you like.
Free-range?
Sounds challenging.
Anyway, he and I are supposed to be having a working breakfast together.
I'd ask you to join us, Gordon, but, you know...
Oh, no Sweatsville, Idaho, Stu.
So tell me, do they do a good working breakfast here?
I don't believe I've ever actually working-breakfasted at this hotel before.
They only do the best working breakfast in the state of Telford, Gordon.
Waiter.
Gordon, you'll take some coffee, surely.
Well, I don't know.
How does the coffee perform?
Oh, the coffee performs okay, Gordon.
Don't you worry about that.
Waiter, pot of coffee for two.
Make sure it's hot, strong and in a pot.
Okay?
For two.
If you see Mr Clark, tell him I'm in the executive breakfast lounge, will you?
How will I know Mr Clark, sir?
I beg your pardon.
How will I recognise Mr Clark?
Are you trying to be funny?
Derek Clark, he's...
You know, his lapel badge.
He's with Unitec.
-Lapel badge!
-Yes, sir.
And he's to meet you in the breakfast lounge.
In the executive breakfast lounge.
-There's only one breakfast lounge, sir.
-Yes, and it's the executive breakfast lounge!
Right.
I'll tell him, sir.
Hey, sonny.
Come here.
If you've got any thoughts about making it in the hotel business, then you better just watch your lip, okay?
That's all.
-I'm sorry...
-That's all.
Thank you.
That's all.
Thank you very much, waiter!
That is all.
The kid's just green, Stu.
Oh, Gordon, when you and I were green... we didn't go around giving lip to busy senior executives.
No, we used to give them a bit of tongue from time to time.
-So, looks like Derek Clark stood you up.
-No, it's all right.
He rang down and said he was having a bit of trouble with the trouser press in his room.
It's an executive trouser press, you see.
Derek tried to put an ordinary leisure trouser on it and, not surprisingly, the machine wouldn't play.
-What a son of a bitch.
-Yeah.
So what about yourself, Gordon.
What's keeping you off the streets these days?
Well, actually, I've gone into business for myself, Stuart.
Yeah?
I hope you're taking good advice.
The very best.
I've got hold of a new kind of bank account.
It's called...
Smug.
I wish you the very best of luck, Gordon.
I really do, because you and I, hey, we go all the way back.
Oh, right the way back to the end zone, Stu.
You know what they used to call us back in Reading?
-What was that?
-The wild dogs of retailing.
-Wild dogs.
-Yeah.
Yeah.
You and I, we broke a few moulds in our time, eh, Gordon?
-Yeah, and a few eggs.
-Yeah.
-Eggs?
-You can't make an omelette...
-Yes, I can.
-No, you can't.
-Yes, I can.
-Not without breaking eggs.
So what if I can't, Gordon?
I mean, I'm a busy man.
My talents lie in other directions.
No, no.
I mean, you can't make an omelette without breaking eggs.
What is this, Cookery Corner?
I don't need this, Gordon, all right?
I'm about to have a working breakfast with the toughest divisional sales manager since Moses and all of a sudden you're giving me a list of all the things I can't do!
Thanks for the support, partner.
-No, Stu, I only meant...
-What am I supposed to say?
"Derek, I'm not right for this job, choose someone else.
I can't make an omelette."
-No, you can, Stu.
But not without...
-It's delegation, Gordon.
I don't have the time.
I want an omelette, I go to an omelette-maker.
Does that make me a failure?
All right, I'm a failure.
I can't make an omelette without breaking eggs.
Well, no one can, Stu.
That's the point.
It's impossible.
-What do you mean, it's impossible?
-It can't be done.
What do you think I've been eating all these years?
I had an omelette last night.
Yeah, but they broke the eggs.
I hardly think they'd use broken eggs in executive room service, Gordon.
Do you know what I'd like to know?
-Have you told me before?
-No.
Then how can I possibly?
I'd like to know why, oh, why, oh, why the word gay has been so ruthlessly hijacked from our beloved English language.
I agree with your question 1 00%.
-Gay used to be such a lovely word.
-A lovely word.
Yes.
You can't use it anymore.
It's been taken away from us.
That's right.
No longer can ordinary people, such as we, use an ordinary word, like gay, in an ordinary example of the great British sentence.
Without people thinking that you mean poofy.
It's a disgrace.
Damn shame.
And there's another one, you see?
Poofy.
You can't say that anymore.
-Of course you can't.
-Used to.
-All the time.
-Yes, but now...
-Now.
-...people think you mean arse bandit.
Arse bandit.
There you go again, you see?
-Well, of course you do.
-You know, arse bandit.
-Perfectly decent couple of words.
-That's right.
-Used to use them every day.
-So did I.
"Would you care to have a go on the arse bandit?" One used to ask, quite innocently.
Yes.
Yes, or, "Back in a moment, darling.
I'm just taking the arse bandit to the menders."
Yeah.
-But now, of course...
-Nowadays.
-...people think you mean homosexual.
-Right.
-And there's another one.
-Yeah.
When was the last time you could use the word homosexual in its proper context?
-Right, and it's such a lovely word.
-Oh, it's one of the great words.
"My word, Jane," I used to say to my wife, "the garden's looking very homosexual this morning."
Quite right.
Quite right.
Lovely word.
One of the great words.
Always were.
"Landlord, I'll have two foaming pints of your most homosexual beer, thank you."
"Oh, and a packet of arse bandits as well."
Right.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes. "And keep the change."
-Right.
-Yes.
-But now...
-Nowadays.
-People just laugh at you.
-That's right.
Oh, well, I'm off to the dry-cleaner's to pick up a couple of screaming benders.
-Are you coming?
-I don't see why not.
Then we can get them home and go to bed with them.
-That's right.
-That's right.
Morning.
You're ugly.
No.
Um...
We're not...
We're not doing that one.
No.
If you remember, I didn't like it.
I thought that was quite funny, that one.
-Yes.
Yes, we'll be doing this one instead.
-Right.
All right then.
Right.
Huh.
I can see you've fallen in love already, sir.
-Oh, hello.
Yes, I was just looking at the...
-The Aston Martin.
Isn't she beautiful?
To be honest with you, that's the best car in the place, that one.
Out of all of them, that is the best one in the place.
Only come in Tuesday, as a matter of fact.
Obviously it's not for me.
It's for my nephew.
-It's his birthday tomorrow.
He'll be nine.
-Yeah, that's nice.
And he told me he's set his heart on an Aston Martin so...
Yeah, well, you know, who wouldn't?
To be honest with you, if I had the money, that is the one I would...
You know, for my own personal use, I would choose that one.
-You can have a go on it if you want.
-Really?
Yeah, sure.
I'll get it out for you.
(IMITATING CAR ENGINE)
-Goes a bit, doesn't it?
-Yeah.
(IMITATING CAR ENGINE)
Sounds a bit rough to me.
Yeah, that's 'cause you're not getting your tongue far enough back in your throat.
That's why.
-Like that, you see?
-Oh, right.
Yeah.
Oh, yes.
Good.
So how much is it?
The Aston Martin DB6 Plantagenet silver.
Oh, that's £4.
-£4?
-Yeah.
And it's one owner.
Immaculate history.
It's not new, then?
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
No, you won't get a new Aston for £4.
That is cheap.
That is a good price.
For an Aston, £4 is cheap.
I'm telling you.
Obviously, we make sure that the vehicle is completely immaculate before it goes out of here.
We do a complete five-point check on the vehicle.
We clean and polish it... and then we do the other four things that are included in the five-point check.
Basically, we do everything that is humanely possible to the car.
Look, if you're not sure, you know, why not bring your nephew in?
You know, if he knows about Astons.
Maybe he'd like to have a look underneath it.
We can have a look underneath it now if you want.
-Clean.
Yeah.
-It is clean.
It is clean.
Yes.
Do you exchange?
-Well, what's he got at the moment?
-A tractor.
Well, I'll be lucky to shift a tractor by new year.
Maybe 40p.
He is very fond of his tractor.
All right, then.
It's his birthday.
You're an ugly bastard. 50p.
I'd just like to tell you about this cigarette case.
It used to belong to my grandfather on my parents' side.
He was given it by his god-niece as a kind of loss of virginity present, really.
He took it with him to Flanders in 1 91 2 when he went there on holiday.
Then he took it again in 1 91 5 when he went to fight in the war.
Now, what grandfather used to do is he would keep cigarettes in it like this.
And if he wanted one, he would simply take it out, smoke it and close the case again.
Now, he used to keep his cigarette case here, in the breast pocket of his field tunic, or battle blouse.
Now, one day grandfather had to go over the top, out of the trenches into action and he was shot by a German sniper clean through the temple.
Now, if grandfather had worn his cigarette case here... um... it would have an unpleasant dent in it... and I'd be alive today.
Oh, that's...
That's brilliant, that is.
That's fantastic.
What?
The wars are funny now, are they?
The First World War was just a joke to you, I suppose, was it?
Well, yes, not very well-told.
Oh, right, so the Great War and World War II were just vast entertainments laid on for your benefit, were they?
Well, if you put it that way, then obviously yes.
Do you know, I wonder, what it's like to die?
-Erm...no, I don't, actually.
-No, right.
But do you think it's funny that millions of people died for you?
I don't think millions of people did die for me.
They didn't know me.
I wasn't born.
They happened to be dying for generations yet unborn,
-which I think includes you.
-Yes, but they didn't know that, did they?
They didn't go into battle shouting,
"Let's die for Stephen Fry who may or may not be born one day."
-They were just obeying orders.
-Oh, forget it.
Forget it.
Sick, you are.
Sick.
Well, I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
I mean, the fact is I am sick.
But I don't think even Hugh knows quite how sick I am.
The fact is, and this is something only Hugh's closest friends are aware of, that he has been suffering now for sometime from a gradual but persistent deterioration in his eyesight.
Normally, it's absolutely fine.
No one would ever know.
He learns the position of all the furniture, all the props on stage and no one could ever guess.
But today, so sick am I, I just went out this morning and moved everything here just...
Oh, dear.
I'm sorry.
It was sick of me.
As you can see, he's completely disoriented.
I don't know...
I don't know why I did it.
I'm sorry.
It was sick of me.
-All right.
Come on, let's get on with it.
-Sorry.
On with the sketch.
Soldiers are...
Now, I don't know how to tell you this so I'm going to have to come straight out with it.
-I'm afraid I can't let you go on the escape.
-I'm sorry, sir?
-I can't let you go on the escape.
-Well, why not, sir?
Because, Whitlow, because you're blind.
That's why not.
-No, I'm not, sir.
-You're blind, Whitlow, and I can't jeopardise the lives of 1 4 other prisoners just because one of the members of the escape party happens to be blind.
-Pardon, sir?
-I said, I can't...
-What's the matter?
Are you deaf?
-Yes, sir.
-You're deaf and blind?
-No, just deaf, sir.
No, you're blind as well, Whitlow.
You keep bumping into things.
Oh, that!
Oh, well, that's just a joke, sir.
It's not very funny, is it?
Well, the chaps like it, sir.
-If you'll pardon the pun.
-What pun?
-Wasn't there a pun?
Oh, I'm sorry.
-No.
All right, you claim you can see.
I have here, Whitlow, an electric carving knife.
I'm going to plug it in, switch it on and throw it at you.
If you don't drop it, I'll let you go on the escape.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that, sir.
I haven't thrown it yet.
Actually, I was telling a bit of a lie just now.
-Ah, you mean you're not deaf?
-No, I mean I am blind.
-You're blind and deaf?
-Pardon?
Well, I can't very well let you go on the escape if you're deaf and blind, now can I?
It was a forlorn hope, sir, yes.
Just a moment.
If you're deaf, how can you hear what I'm saying?
-I can lip-read, sir.
-Ah, I see.
Lip-read?
-But you're blind!
-Pardon?
How can you read my lips if you're blind?
Oh, well, it's because I'm deaf, sir, that my sense of vision is naturally enhanced.
Blind people are known to have very keen hearing.
So they sort of cancel each other out, sir.
-You mean you can see and hear perfectly?
-Yes, because I'm blind and deaf.
One miraculously compensates for the other.
You poor beggar, but I still can't let you go on the escape.
It's because I'm dumb, isn't it, sir?
-It's a talker's world.
-What are you talking about?
-If you can't talk, you're nobody, nothing.
A zero.
-Whitlow, shut up.
They think it means I'm stupid, but I've got ideas...
Be quiet, Whitlow.
You're not coming on this escape.
If it's because I can't smell, sir.
You are not coming on this escape and that is final.
But, sir, I lost my sense of smell while forging the minutest details of a thousand Nazi documents.
I know that, Whitlow, but you can't come because you're a bastard and we hate you.
-We don't want you to come.
-Oh, fair enough, sir.
Oh, hi, Bradley.
I just looked in to see if I couldn't have a borrow of your garden sprinklie.
Oh, sure, mate.
Help yourself.
It's over there in the coolie.
Thanks, mate.
By the way, how are Javelina and Trevelin these days?
Jings, mate, don't reopen old wounds.
Was I doing that, Craig?
Was I reopening old wounds?
-Old sores?
-You certainly were.
Listen, Shane, a word to the wise.
If you wanna re-establish your relationship with those two, you've got to stop running away from yourself.
Jings, mate, don't you think I know that?
Don't you think I've tried not running away from myself?
It seems like every time I look out the window, there I go haring down the street.
-Away from yourself?
-Away from myself, precisely.
How does Donna feel about this?
Owen, I'm gonna ask you man to man, leave Donna out of this.
All right, I'm sorry.
Keep your sweat on.
It's okay, mate.
It's just that ever since Morwenna's graphic design studio went down the tubes,
I just seem to have withdrawn right into myself.
Oh, heck, Findley.
You can't blame yourself for that.
Sean over-capitalised.
You warned him time and time enough.
Yeah, but performance is the bottom line, Clark, and I hold myself accountable in no small measure.
Well, how do you think I feel, Declan, for crike's sakes, eh?
I personally underwrote the equity on Yvonne's marital boutique.
It's my ass on the bottom line, too, you know.
Listen, you leave Yvonne out of this, all right?
Jings, mate, I'm sorry.
God, it's pretty stuffy in here.
Why don't we get some fresh air?
Sure, mate, help yourself.
There's some air freshener in the dunnie over there.
Oh, by the way, I know what it was I wanted to say to you.
We're having a barbie tomorrow night.
Do you want to come along?
You leave Barbie out of this!
No, a barbecue.
It's to celebrate the opening of Morkwinda's new executive fitness centre and garage.
-Do you want to come?
-Sounds great.
Okay, then.
-Oh, Jims!
-What?
I've just seen Joycie coming up the pathie.
Oh, Jims!
Listen, there's something I've been discussing with Castella and Lilette.
And I'd rather that, you know, Joycie and Lenore didn't find out about it.
What?
Spit it out, mate, she's almost here.
Look, I don't know how to tell you this, mate.
It's hard for me to say.
The fact is...
I've been having, well, affair, it's the only word.
I've been having an affair with you for sometime now.
-What?
-It's true.
You bastard!
Look, mate, you had to find out sooner or later and I'd just rather it came from me, that's all.
You mean we've been sleeping together all this time?
Behind my back?
I've said I'm sorry.
I don't know what else I can say.
The fact is that...
I was vulnerable and you were there.
You leave me out of this!
I've said I'm sorry.
I just don't know what else I can say, mate.
Why am I always the last one to know?
It won't happen again, Vin.
I promise.
I just wish that if you were gonna sleep with me, you could at least have done it to my face.
I'll bear that in mind for next time.
The truth is, mate, I was confused and slightly bewildered.
I'd just discovered that Durnik isn't my real father.
He isn't!
Well, then who is?
I am.
-Then that must mean that you must be...
-Exactly.
Devlin's half-sister's wife's doctor's cousin's niece.
Well, then who the hell am I?
I don't know, mate, but it's your round.
AGENT 1 :
Okay, stand by, everybody.
Tangos One and Two have now entered the Arrivals Hall.
AGENT 2:
Which has the case, please?
AGENT 1 :
Tango One has the case at this stage.
AGENT 2:
Right, hold on Tango One, then, please.
AGENT 1 :
Oh, there's been a changeover.
Tango One has passed the case to Tango Two.
And Tango Two doesn't want it, he's given it back.
AGENT 2:
What?
Are you sure that is Tango Two?
AGENT 1 :
Well, I thought it was Tango Two.
Whoever he is, he didn't...
Oh, no, it's Tango Two all right.
He just doesn't want the case.
Well, neither of them wants the case now.
AGENT 2:
Well, who has the case?
AGENT 1 :
Tango One.
Well, they're looking around now.
I think they may...
They may just be beginning to get a little bit suspicious now.
I think they may have sensed the camera.
AGENT 2:
Have they rumbled our position?
AGENT 1 :
I think they've rumbled our position.
AGENT 2:
Well, pull out, pull out.
All units, trouser, trouser, trouser.
All units, trouser, trouser, trouser.
Pull out.
Anyway, the hire car was absolutely ready and waiting when we arrived at Heraklion airport.
We'd done a deal with Hertz, through Amex, which meant we were able to upgrade the category without paying the extra price differential.
This is one of the Hertz girl, Tonya, with the car.
It's a Renault Mountaineer, specially designed for the Cretan terrain.
Handles beautifully, we were very pleased with the colour.
Were you, by crikey.
Anyway, I'd studied the map of the roads from Heraklion while having lunch on the plane.
-Did I tell you about lunch on the plane?
-In some detail, as a matter of fact.
Oh, look, here's another one of the lunch tray.
I don't know how that got in there, must have muddled up the order somehow.
I've been sucked into the deepest pit of hell.
Oh, look.
And here's one of the Renault's instrument panel.
Uniquely fascinating.
That's the left-hand control stalk with main beam, wipe wash and hooter on it.
Oh, that's interesting!
And here's one of the right-hand control stalk with indicators and so forth.
Oh, I think this is gonna give me an erection.
Anyway, so we skirted round Souda Bay via Thalakos.
I discovered this marvellous little off-the-beaten-track taverna.
(RETCHING)
It really was so authentic.
Everyone there spoke...
-Really, you should have been there.
-Oh, no.
I shouldn't.
No, I shouldn't have been there.
No.
-This is one of me pointing at my moussaka.
-Oh, wait a second, isn't that a revolting sight?
And this is one of me on the toilet half an hour later.
I used a self-timer for that one because the whole new Minolta range have got self-timers.
Self-timers?
Oh, well, then I must leave at once.
I discovered this marvellous little man in Hadia who developed film the traditional Cretan way.
Nikos his name was, or Costas.
Could have been Andreas.
Oh, but I must find out.
Which?
Which was his name?
-This is him on the toilet.
-Go away!
(SOBBING)
Right.
Well, you touch my daughter again and it'll be a slide show.
You understand?
-Hello.
Both just got time to tell you...
-Just.
Just got time, yes.
We both, well, we both used to have problems around here, didn't we?
-Just around the eye area.
-Certainly did.
-Just there.
-And this area as well.
-Here and round there.
-That's right.
It was awful.
Our eyes just kept coming out, didn't they?
-Couldn't keep them in.
It was horrible.
-Ghastly.
Now, thankfully, it's all cleared up.
-It's stopped happening, hasn't it?
-Effectively, yes.
Yes, yes, they don't fall out anymore and we're pleased about that, aren't we?
-Delighted.
Yes.
-Hmm.
-Officer!
-Good morning, sir.
Would you like to take a seat?
-Is there a queue?
-Well, you may be more comfortable that way.
No.
I'm all right standing up, thanks.
My name's Oliver, by the way.
Excited to know you.
-Oh, Peter Franks.
-Hi, Peter.
Peter, listen would you like a coffee?
Filter, espresso, cappuccino.
We offer decaf on all of those.
Well, that's very kind.
Do you have a tea?
Tea...
I don't think so, Peter.
I'll just check that for you.
Hello, Mabel, my love.
It's Oliver here.
Listen, my darling, do we carry a tea machine?
-Sorry, dear.
-Yes, I thought not.
Many thanks, pet.
-Sorry, Peter, no tea.
-Oh, doesn't matter.
Don't worry.
-So, how may we help you?
-Well, this is a police station, isn't it?
-Well, of course it is, Peter.
Yes.
-Yes. 'Cause I tried to ring you earlier but you must have changed your number, all I got was music playing in my ear.
The thing is, my car's been stolen.
-Your car's been stolen?
-Yes.
Oh, Peter, I am sorry to hear that.
Aw.
And you'd like us to do something about it?
Well, yes, please.
Okay, well, have you had a look at our brochure, Peter?
If you'll pardon the pun.
What pun?
Wasn't there one?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, Peter, if you'd like to come with me, we'll go through it together.
Would you like to take a seat?
Now, Peter, we offer basically three kinds of stolen car recovery service.
That's the super, the lovely and the gorgeous.
Now, the super is a basic non-priority listing of your car.
The lovely is higher priority, and the gorgeous is A1 top priority.
We put all our team onto it, field and creative.
And that also includes a full waxing and valeting
-of your car on recovery.
-I see.
Obviously, Peter, the gorgeous is a more expensive service.
-I beg your pardon?
-Do you have an account with us?
-Account?
No.
-Oh, you're a shareholder, perhaps?
-Well, I'm a citizen, if that's what you mean.
-Citizen.
Oh, you mean client?
Look, I don't want to sound stupid, but I get back to England, I find my car's been stolen...
Peter, you've been away?
Did you perhaps miss the privatisation of the police force?
-The what?
-This is now a branch office of Brit Law PLC.
-Would you like to fill out a form?
-Fill out a form?
Fill out a form?
You mean fill in a form.
Has everyone suddenly turned American?
Now, Peter I shall need your address, I shall need your place and date of birth, your car registration number, and we should be able to have an account verified within 1 4 days.
-Subject to status.
-This is insanity.
I'm a taxpayer.
Peter, everybody had a chance to buy shares at the time of issue.
It was all supervised by a reputable merchant bank.
Well, by a merchant bank anyway.
-This is madness.
I'm leaving.
-No, Peter.
Not that way.
Not that way, Peter.
-What?
-That's the High Street.
-Yes?
-The High Street is owned by UK Highroads PLC.
We're employed by them to make sure that only those with valid roadway passes use the street.
But that's the Queen's highway for goodness sake, surely I can use that.
Queen's...?
Oh, you have shares in the Royal Family PLC.
That would be quite sufficient.
Shares in the...
No, of course I haven't.
Well, Peter, I'm afraid I must ask you to come with me to the restraining bar.
Now, if you'd just like to put your hands on the detention knob.
-But I haven't done anything.
-Not the gold member cuffs for you.
I'm afraid we'll have to use the bronze, Master Peter.
-No, no.
Absolutely...no.
No, I refuse.
No.
-Now, Peter.
Peter.
-Peter?
-What?
Well, you haven't changed that much, then.
Welcome to Argue the Toss.
My tosser this week is Simon Clituris.
Simon Clituris, you saw that sketch.
What did you think?
-Well, I thought the sketch worked on two levels.
-Only two?
Ah.
Yes, you're right.
I'm being simplistic.
I thought it worked on nine levels.
-I thought I spotted 1 2.
-Yes, yes.
Well, yes, 1 2 if you include the...
But, for heaven's sake, let's be condescending about this.
-Absolutely.
-I thought it worked, on the one hand, as a simple satire on modern Britain.
And on the other hand, as a metaphor for the problem of redemption.
-What about the underlying theme?
-Ah.
Which one?
Well, the underlying theme of a man desperately trying to recover his stolen car.
Well, that I thought was the least successful of all the underlying themes.
It didn't work for me.
-That's where the sketch really just disappeared.
-Simply vanished?
-Completely vanished.
-I see.
And the main characters?
Well, I felt I didn't know enough about them.
I was reminded of those occasions when one is asked to sleep with someone one doesn't know particularly well.
Consequently, I was nervous and the whole thing was a disappointment.
-In a word.
-Brilliant.
Simon Clituris, thank you very much.
Welcome to Up the Arts.
Martin Utrecht, you saw those critics there.
-Were you impressed by what they had to say?
-Let me say that it seems to me that what they were trying to achieve was essentially two-fold.
I don't think it would be quite fair to judge them on that small extract we just saw.
Good.
So what was your judgement of the small extract we just saw?
Well, it seems to me that they were trying to assess a comedy sketch, a humouresque routine...
Did that work for you?
For me, there was something about their criticism that was, I don't know, what's the word?
Sterile?
I was going to say fertile.
Hardly different.
No, I have to say it didn't work for me, no.
I think, on the one hand, they were trying to encompass too much.
They were overambitious.
I was going to say overcautious.
Yes.
Hardly different.
And, on the other hand, they were trying to present themselves as viable human beings
-attempting to make sense of their...of their, um...
-Environment?
I was going to say trousers.
Hardly different.
Trousers, environment.
Environment, trousers.
It's a kind of square.
I was gonna say circle.
Much the same thing.
And on the other hand...
Ah, you've got three hands.
-I've got three hands...
-They, of course, were doing a two-hander.
Would they have benefited from an extra hand?
Would that have come in...useful?
I feel with an extra hand, they might just have got away with it.
Did you enjoy their criticism?
Oh, I loved it.
I wanted to go to bed with it and kiss it in many soft, private, little places.
-So their future as critics, bulbous, would you say?
-Yes, perineal.
The exact word.
-So we're agreed?
-Of course not.
Hello, welcome to Oh, No, Not Another One.
(AMERICAN ACCENT) Of all the deodorants, this is the one that I enjoy using most.
It feels real nice going on and it smells good and keeps me dry all day.
I don't have to worry about it cutting out in clutch moments.
All of the other ones are just...
I don't know.
They just never seem to hold up under pressure for me.
I can put this on once during the day and for the rest of the day I'm fine, I'm all set up.
I don't have to worry about, you know, social nervousness or anything.
It's just...
It keeps me feeling good and fresh and I love the smell.
I don't think there's any deodorant that comes close to this one.
I think it was Donald Mainstock, the great amateur squash player, who pointed out how lovely I was.
Until that time, I think it was safe to say that I had never really been aware of my own timeless brand of loveliness.
But his words smote me because, of course you see,
I am lovely in a fluffy moist kind of a way and who would have it otherwise?
I walk, let's be splendid about this, in a lightly accented cloud of gorgeousness that isn't far short of being, quite simply, terrific.
The secret of smooth almost shiny loveliness of the order of which we're discussing in this simple, frank, creamy soft way doesn't reside in oils, unguents, balms, ointments, creams, astringents, milks, moisturisers,
liniments, lubricants, embrocations or balsams, to be rather divine for just one noble moment.
It resides, and I mean this in a pink, slightly special way, in one's attitude of mind.
To be gorgeous and high and true and fine and fluffy and moist and sticky and lovely, all you have to do is to believe that one is gorgeous and high and true and fine and fluffy and moist and sticky and lovely.
And I believe it of myself, tremulously at first, and then with mounting heat and passion because, stopping off for a second to be super again, I'm so often told it.
That's the secret really.
Waiter.
-Sir?
-There's something wrong with my soup.
Oh, I wouldn't say that, sir.
It looks very smart to me.
What?
Nice pinstripe.
No, no.
No, my soup.
There's something wrong with my soup.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I thought you said suit.
It, um, tastes...odd, somehow.
-What does?
-My soup.
-Does it?
-Hmm.
-May I, sir?
-Please do.
Thank you.
-Seems all right to me.
-No.
No, my soup.
My soup tastes odd.
-Oh, your soup!
-Yes.
-Oh, dear!
-Taste it.
I just have, sir.
Not my suit.
I want you to try my soup.
Oh, I'd rather not if you don't mind, sir.
-Why not?
-Probably too long in the arms.
No, no, no.
What's the matter with you?
I'm talking about my soup.
S-O-U-P.
-Oh, your soup!
-Yes!
-Is there something wrong with it, sir?
-Well, I've told you.
It tastes odd.
-Well, may I, sir?
-Please.
Thank you so much.
-Ah, yes.
-"Ah, yes" what?
It's the cyanide, sir.
I beg your pardon?
Chef does occasionally, in my opinion, tend to overstress the cyanide in his pottage.
Are you telling me that the chef has put cyanide in the soup?
No, sir, he's put cyanide in the soup.
-That's what I said.
-Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I thought you said suit.
This is outrageous!
Would you like me to bring you some soup without cyanide in it, sir?
-Yeah.
No, I mean...
-Or perhaps something else from the menu?
Well, why?
Why has the chef put cyanide in the soup?
He has a club foot, sir.
-What?
-The chef has a club foot.
Well, I've got a bent nose but I don't go around massacring perfectly innocent diners.
-There's no cyanide in the mozzarella salad, sir.
-Oh, yippee.
Just a hint of strychnine but not so as you'd notice.
Oh, this is absurd.
You're right.
It is completely ridiculous.
Well, would you like to be a comedy writer?
What's happened is that we've deliberately left this sketch without a tagging punch line.
Or ending, as we call it in the trade.
That's right.
Now, that's where you come in.
The lines are now open for you to phone in your payoff to this hilarious skitlet.
But just as an added difficulty, we're not actually going to give you the telephone number to ring.
No, that's right.
You have to use your skill and judgement to think up a witty, apt and amusing telephone number of your own.
And if British Telecom think it's funny enough, they'll put you through to our switchboard here.
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello.
And we have a clear winner straightaway.
Mr JD Ward of Basildon.
Well, well done, JD Ward.
If you'll be so kind as to let us know your chest size, we'll send you a A Bit of Fry Laurie chequebook and pen straightaway.
-Well, let's go back to where we were, then.
-Right.
Oh, this is absurd.
You're right.
It is completely ridiculous.
The brown soup has no cyanide in it whatsoever, sir.
-The brown soup?
-That's right, sir.
No toxics, radioactive particles or microbes of any description?
Not a drop, sir.
-I'll have some of that, then.
-Right you are, sir.
Honestly.
Nice one, JD.
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
Mr Hugh Laurie has kindly agreed to embarrass us all with a song of his own composing entitled, quite simply, Mystery.
Mr Hugh Laurie.
Mystery.
# Mystery
# All my life has been a mystery
# You and I were never ever meant to be
# That's why I call my love for you a mystery
# Different country
# You and I have always lived in a different country
# And I know that airline tickets don't grow on a tree
# So what kept us apart is plain for me to see
# That much at least is not really a mystery
# Estuary
# I live in a houseboat on an estuary
# Which is handy for my work with the Thames Water Authority
# But I know you would have found it insanitary
# Insanitary
# Taken a violent dislike to me
# I'd be foolish to ignore the possibility
# That if we'd ever actually met you might have hated me
# Still, that's not the only problem that I can see
# Dead since 1 973
# You've been dead now
# Wait a minute, let me see
# Fifteen years come next January
# As a human being, you are history
# So why do I still long for you?
# Why is my love so strong for you?
# Why did I write this song for you?
# Well, I guess it's just a mystery
# Mystery #
Mr Marsh?
Mmm-hmm.
Would you like me to take your bags up to your executive suite, Mr Marsh?
Oh, no, thanks very much.
I'm gonna be checking out in the morning... (LAUGHING)
Gordon Inglis, as I live and close a sale, you crazy old buffalo.
-What the hell are you doing here?
-Oh, Stuart Marsh, you turbo-charged son of a mass retailer.
How are you?
Well, I'm hanging pretty tough, Gordon.
Hanging pretty tough.
What about yourself?
Things not going so well, eh?
Oh, no.
I'm strictly moving to the rhythm, Stu.
Why do you ask?
Why do I ask?
Well, Gordon, really.
I mean, being a porter in a hotel, it's hardly the big time, is it?
No...
Stuart, that was a joke.
Oh, well, then!
Blimey, that's nice.
I like that very much.
Yeah, very good.
So tell me, you old roister-doister, what the hell are you doing in Telford?
The last I heard you were based out of Peterborough.
Yeah, I did a spell in Peterborough, Gordon.
It's part of a big new management shake up, but right now I'm fixing up to meet with old Derek Clark.
Derek "the Fiddler" Clark?
# If I was a rich man #
The man's a legend.
So tell me, you're gonna be working under Derek Clark now, is that it?
Well, not so much under, Gordon, more kind of alongside.
I'm gonna be a sort of flexible, highly-resourced, independently-targeted, free-range trouble-shooter, if you like.
Free-range?
Sounds challenging.
Anyway, he and I are supposed to be having a working breakfast together.
I'd ask you to join us, Gordon, but, you know...
Oh, no Sweatsville, Idaho, Stu.
So tell me, do they do a good working breakfast here?
I don't believe I've ever actually working-breakfasted at this hotel before.
They only do the best working breakfast in the state of Telford, Gordon.
Waiter.
Gordon, you'll take some coffee, surely.
Well, I don't know.
How does the coffee perform?
Oh, the coffee performs okay, Gordon.
Don't you worry about that.
Waiter, pot of coffee for two.
Make sure it's hot, strong and in a pot.
Okay?
For two.
If you see Mr Clark, tell him I'm in the executive breakfast lounge, will you?
How will I know Mr Clark, sir?
I beg your pardon.
How will I recognise Mr Clark?
Are you trying to be funny?
Derek Clark, he's...
You know, his lapel badge.
He's with Unitec.
-Lapel badge!
-Yes, sir.
And he's to meet you in the breakfast lounge.
In the executive breakfast lounge.
-There's only one breakfast lounge, sir.
-Yes, and it's the executive breakfast lounge!
Right.
I'll tell him, sir.
Hey, sonny.
Come here.
If you've got any thoughts about making it in the hotel business, then you better just watch your lip, okay?
That's all.
-I'm sorry...
-That's all.
Thank you.
That's all.
Thank you very much, waiter!
That is all.
The kid's just green, Stu.
Oh, Gordon, when you and I were green... we didn't go around giving lip to busy senior executives.
No, we used to give them a bit of tongue from time to time.
-So, looks like Derek Clark stood you up.
-No, it's all right.
He rang down and said he was having a bit of trouble with the trouser press in his room.
It's an executive trouser press, you see.
Derek tried to put an ordinary leisure trouser on it and, not surprisingly, the machine wouldn't play.
-What a son of a bitch.
-Yeah.
So what about yourself, Gordon.
What's keeping you off the streets these days?
Well, actually, I've gone into business for myself, Stuart.
Yeah?
I hope you're taking good advice.
The very best.
I've got hold of a new kind of bank account.
It's called...
Smug.
I wish you the very best of luck, Gordon.
I really do, because you and I, hey, we go all the way back.
Oh, right the way back to the end zone, Stu.
You know what they used to call us back in Reading?
-What was that?
-The wild dogs of retailing.
-Wild dogs.
-Yeah.
Yeah.
You and I, we broke a few moulds in our time, eh, Gordon?
-Yeah, and a few eggs.
-Yeah.
-Eggs?
-You can't make an omelette...
-Yes, I can.
-No, you can't.
-Yes, I can.
-Not without breaking eggs.
So what if I can't, Gordon?
I mean, I'm a busy man.
My talents lie in other directions.
No, no.
I mean, you can't make an omelette without breaking eggs.
What is this, Cookery Corner?
I don't need this, Gordon, all right?
I'm about to have a working breakfast with the toughest divisional sales manager since Moses and all of a sudden you're giving me a list of all the things I can't do!
Thanks for the support, partner.
-No, Stu, I only meant...
-What am I supposed to say?
"Derek, I'm not right for this job, choose someone else.
I can't make an omelette."
-No, you can, Stu.
But not without...
-It's delegation, Gordon.
I don't have the time.
I want an omelette, I go to an omelette-maker.
Does that make me a failure?
All right, I'm a failure.
I can't make an omelette without breaking eggs.
Well, no one can, Stu.
That's the point.
It's impossible.
-What do you mean, it's impossible?
-It can't be done.
What do you think I've been eating all these years?
I had an omelette last night.
Yeah, but they broke the eggs.
I hardly think they'd use broken eggs in executive room service, Gordon.
Do you know what I'd like to know?
-Have you told me before?
-No.
Then how can I possibly?
I'd like to know why, oh, why, oh, why the word gay has been so ruthlessly hijacked from our beloved English language.
I agree with your question 1 00%.
-Gay used to be such a lovely word.
-A lovely word.
Yes.
You can't use it anymore.
It's been taken away from us.
That's right.
No longer can ordinary people, such as we, use an ordinary word, like gay, in an ordinary example of the great British sentence.
Without people thinking that you mean poofy.
It's a disgrace.
Damn shame.
And there's another one, you see?
Poofy.
You can't say that anymore.
-Of course you can't.
-Used to.
-All the time.
-Yes, but now...
-Now.
-...people think you mean arse bandit.
Arse bandit.
There you go again, you see?
-Well, of course you do.
-You know, arse bandit.
-Perfectly decent couple of words.
-That's right.
-Used to use them every day.
-So did I.
"Would you care to have a go on the arse bandit?" One used to ask, quite innocently.
Yes.
Yes, or, "Back in a moment, darling.
I'm just taking the arse bandit to the menders."
Yeah.
-But now, of course...
-Nowadays.
-...people think you mean homosexual.
-Right.
-And there's another one.
-Yeah.
When was the last time you could use the word homosexual in its proper context?
-Right, and it's such a lovely word.
-Oh, it's one of the great words.
"My word, Jane," I used to say to my wife, "the garden's looking very homosexual this morning."
Quite right.
Quite right.
Lovely word.
One of the great words.
Always were.
"Landlord, I'll have two foaming pints of your most homosexual beer, thank you."
"Oh, and a packet of arse bandits as well."
Right.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes. "And keep the change."
-Right.
-Yes.
-But now...
-Nowadays.
-People just laugh at you.
-That's right.
Oh, well, I'm off to the dry-cleaner's to pick up a couple of screaming benders.
-Are you coming?
-I don't see why not.
Then we can get them home and go to bed with them.
-That's right.
-That's right.
Morning.
You're ugly.
No.
Um...
We're not...
We're not doing that one.
No.
If you remember, I didn't like it.
I thought that was quite funny, that one.
-Yes.
Yes, we'll be doing this one instead.
-Right.
All right then.
Right.
Huh.
I can see you've fallen in love already, sir.
-Oh, hello.
Yes, I was just looking at the...
-The Aston Martin.
Isn't she beautiful?
To be honest with you, that's the best car in the place, that one.
Out of all of them, that is the best one in the place.
Only come in Tuesday, as a matter of fact.
Obviously it's not for me.
It's for my nephew.
-It's his birthday tomorrow.
He'll be nine.
-Yeah, that's nice.
And he told me he's set his heart on an Aston Martin so...
Yeah, well, you know, who wouldn't?
To be honest with you, if I had the money, that is the one I would...
You know, for my own personal use, I would choose that one.
-You can have a go on it if you want.
-Really?
Yeah, sure.
I'll get it out for you.
(IMITATING CAR ENGINE)
-Goes a bit, doesn't it?
-Yeah.
(IMITATING CAR ENGINE)
Sounds a bit rough to me.
Yeah, that's 'cause you're not getting your tongue far enough back in your throat.
That's why.
-Like that, you see?
-Oh, right.
Yeah.
Oh, yes.
Good.
So how much is it?
The Aston Martin DB6 Plantagenet silver.
Oh, that's £4.
-£4?
-Yeah.
And it's one owner.
Immaculate history.
It's not new, then?
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
No, you won't get a new Aston for £4.
That is cheap.
That is a good price.
For an Aston, £4 is cheap.
I'm telling you.
Obviously, we make sure that the vehicle is completely immaculate before it goes out of here.
We do a complete five-point check on the vehicle.
We clean and polish it... and then we do the other four things that are included in the five-point check.
Basically, we do everything that is humanely possible to the car.
Look, if you're not sure, you know, why not bring your nephew in?
You know, if he knows about Astons.
Maybe he'd like to have a look underneath it.
We can have a look underneath it now if you want.
-Clean.
Yeah.
-It is clean.
It is clean.
Yes.
Do you exchange?
-Well, what's he got at the moment?
-A tractor.
Well, I'll be lucky to shift a tractor by new year.
Maybe 40p.
He is very fond of his tractor.
All right, then.
It's his birthday.
You're an ugly bastard. 50p.
I'd just like to tell you about this cigarette case.
It used to belong to my grandfather on my parents' side.
He was given it by his god-niece as a kind of loss of virginity present, really.
He took it with him to Flanders in 1 91 2 when he went there on holiday.
Then he took it again in 1 91 5 when he went to fight in the war.
Now, what grandfather used to do is he would keep cigarettes in it like this.
And if he wanted one, he would simply take it out, smoke it and close the case again.
Now, he used to keep his cigarette case here, in the breast pocket of his field tunic, or battle blouse.
Now, one day grandfather had to go over the top, out of the trenches into action and he was shot by a German sniper clean through the temple.
Now, if grandfather had worn his cigarette case here... um... it would have an unpleasant dent in it... and I'd be alive today.
Oh, that's...
That's brilliant, that is.
That's fantastic.
What?
The wars are funny now, are they?
The First World War was just a joke to you, I suppose, was it?
Well, yes, not very well-told.
Oh, right, so the Great War and World War II were just vast entertainments laid on for your benefit, were they?
Well, if you put it that way, then obviously yes.
Do you know, I wonder, what it's like to die?
-Erm...no, I don't, actually.
-No, right.
But do you think it's funny that millions of people died for you?
I don't think millions of people did die for me.
They didn't know me.
I wasn't born.
They happened to be dying for generations yet unborn,
-which I think includes you.
-Yes, but they didn't know that, did they?
They didn't go into battle shouting,
"Let's die for Stephen Fry who may or may not be born one day."
-They were just obeying orders.
-Oh, forget it.
Forget it.
Sick, you are.
Sick.
Well, I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
I mean, the fact is I am sick.
But I don't think even Hugh knows quite how sick I am.
The fact is, and this is something only Hugh's closest friends are aware of, that he has been suffering now for sometime from a gradual but persistent deterioration in his eyesight.
Normally, it's absolutely fine.
No one would ever know.
He learns the position of all the furniture, all the props on stage and no one could ever guess.
But today, so sick am I, I just went out this morning and moved everything here just...
Oh, dear.
I'm sorry.
It was sick of me.
As you can see, he's completely disoriented.
I don't know...
I don't know why I did it.
I'm sorry.
It was sick of me.
-All right.
Come on, let's get on with it.
-Sorry.
On with the sketch.
Soldiers are...
Now, I don't know how to tell you this so I'm going to have to come straight out with it.
-I'm afraid I can't let you go on the escape.
-I'm sorry, sir?
-I can't let you go on the escape.
-Well, why not, sir?
Because, Whitlow, because you're blind.
That's why not.
-No, I'm not, sir.
-You're blind, Whitlow, and I can't jeopardise the lives of 1 4 other prisoners just because one of the members of the escape party happens to be blind.
-Pardon, sir?
-I said, I can't...
-What's the matter?
Are you deaf?
-Yes, sir.
-You're deaf and blind?
-No, just deaf, sir.
No, you're blind as well, Whitlow.
You keep bumping into things.
Oh, that!
Oh, well, that's just a joke, sir.
It's not very funny, is it?
Well, the chaps like it, sir.
-If you'll pardon the pun.
-What pun?
-Wasn't there a pun?
Oh, I'm sorry.
-No.
All right, you claim you can see.
I have here, Whitlow, an electric carving knife.
I'm going to plug it in, switch it on and throw it at you.
If you don't drop it, I'll let you go on the escape.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that, sir.
I haven't thrown it yet.
Actually, I was telling a bit of a lie just now.
-Ah, you mean you're not deaf?
-No, I mean I am blind.
-You're blind and deaf?
-Pardon?
Well, I can't very well let you go on the escape if you're deaf and blind, now can I?
It was a forlorn hope, sir, yes.
Just a moment.
If you're deaf, how can you hear what I'm saying?
-I can lip-read, sir.
-Ah, I see.
Lip-read?
-But you're blind!
-Pardon?
How can you read my lips if you're blind?
Oh, well, it's because I'm deaf, sir, that my sense of vision is naturally enhanced.
Blind people are known to have very keen hearing.
So they sort of cancel each other out, sir.
-You mean you can see and hear perfectly?
-Yes, because I'm blind and deaf.
One miraculously compensates for the other.
You poor beggar, but I still can't let you go on the escape.
It's because I'm dumb, isn't it, sir?
-It's a talker's world.
-What are you talking about?
-If you can't talk, you're nobody, nothing.
A zero.
-Whitlow, shut up.
They think it means I'm stupid, but I've got ideas...
Be quiet, Whitlow.
You're not coming on this escape.
If it's because I can't smell, sir.
You are not coming on this escape and that is final.
But, sir, I lost my sense of smell while forging the minutest details of a thousand Nazi documents.
I know that, Whitlow, but you can't come because you're a bastard and we hate you.
-We don't want you to come.
-Oh, fair enough, sir.
Oh, hi, Bradley.
I just looked in to see if I couldn't have a borrow of your garden sprinklie.
Oh, sure, mate.
Help yourself.
It's over there in the coolie.
Thanks, mate.
By the way, how are Javelina and Trevelin these days?
Jings, mate, don't reopen old wounds.
Was I doing that, Craig?
Was I reopening old wounds?
-Old sores?
-You certainly were.
Listen, Shane, a word to the wise.
If you wanna re-establish your relationship with those two, you've got to stop running away from yourself.
Jings, mate, don't you think I know that?
Don't you think I've tried not running away from myself?
It seems like every time I look out the window, there I go haring down the street.
-Away from yourself?
-Away from myself, precisely.
How does Donna feel about this?
Owen, I'm gonna ask you man to man, leave Donna out of this.
All right, I'm sorry.
Keep your sweat on.
It's okay, mate.
It's just that ever since Morwenna's graphic design studio went down the tubes,
I just seem to have withdrawn right into myself.
Oh, heck, Findley.
You can't blame yourself for that.
Sean over-capitalised.
You warned him time and time enough.
Yeah, but performance is the bottom line, Clark, and I hold myself accountable in no small measure.
Well, how do you think I feel, Declan, for crike's sakes, eh?
I personally underwrote the equity on Yvonne's marital boutique.
It's my ass on the bottom line, too, you know.
Listen, you leave Yvonne out of this, all right?
Jings, mate, I'm sorry.
God, it's pretty stuffy in here.
Why don't we get some fresh air?
Sure, mate, help yourself.
There's some air freshener in the dunnie over there.
Oh, by the way, I know what it was I wanted to say to you.
We're having a barbie tomorrow night.
Do you want to come along?
You leave Barbie out of this!
No, a barbecue.
It's to celebrate the opening of Morkwinda's new executive fitness centre and garage.
-Do you want to come?
-Sounds great.
Okay, then.
-Oh, Jims!
-What?
I've just seen Joycie coming up the pathie.
Oh, Jims!
Listen, there's something I've been discussing with Castella and Lilette.
And I'd rather that, you know, Joycie and Lenore didn't find out about it.
What?
Spit it out, mate, she's almost here.
Look, I don't know how to tell you this, mate.
It's hard for me to say.
The fact is...
I've been having, well, affair, it's the only word.
I've been having an affair with you for sometime now.
-What?
-It's true.
You bastard!
Look, mate, you had to find out sooner or later and I'd just rather it came from me, that's all.
You mean we've been sleeping together all this time?
Behind my back?
I've said I'm sorry.
I don't know what else I can say.
The fact is that...
I was vulnerable and you were there.
You leave me out of this!
I've said I'm sorry.
I just don't know what else I can say, mate.
Why am I always the last one to know?
It won't happen again, Vin.
I promise.
I just wish that if you were gonna sleep with me, you could at least have done it to my face.
I'll bear that in mind for next time.
The truth is, mate, I was confused and slightly bewildered.
I'd just discovered that Durnik isn't my real father.
He isn't!
Well, then who is?
I am.
-Then that must mean that you must be...
-Exactly.
Devlin's half-sister's wife's doctor's cousin's niece.
Well, then who the hell am I?
I don't know, mate, but it's your round.
Okay, stand by, everybody.
Tangos One and Two have now entered the Arrivals Hall.
Which has the case, please?
Tango One has the case at this stage.
Right, hold on Tango One, then, please.
Oh, there's been a changeover.
Tango One has passed the case to Tango Two.
And Tango Two doesn't want it, he's given it back.
What?
Are you sure that is Tango Two?
Well, I thought it was Tango Two.
Whoever he is, he didn't...
Oh, no, it's Tango Two all right.
He just doesn't want the case.
Well, neither of them wants the case now.
Well, who has the case?
Tango One.
Well, they're looking around now.
I think they may...
They may just be beginning to get a little bit suspicious now.
I think they may have sensed the camera.
Have they rumbled our position?
I think they've rumbled our position.
Well, pull out, pull out.
All units, trouser, trouser, trouser.
All units, trouser, trouser, trouser.
Pull out.
Anyway, the hire car was absolutely ready and waiting when we arrived at Heraklion airport.
We'd done a deal with Hertz, through Amex, which meant we were able to upgrade the category without paying the extra price differential.
This is one of the Hertz girl, Tonya, with the car.
It's a Renault Mountaineer, specially designed for the Cretan terrain.
Handles beautifully, we were very pleased with the colour.
Were you, by crikey.
Anyway, I'd studied the map of the roads from Heraklion while having lunch on the plane.
- Did I tell you about lunch on the plane?
- In some detail, as a matter of fact.
Oh, look, here's another one of the lunch tray.
I don't know how that got in there, must have muddled up the order somehow.
I've been sucked into the deepest pit of hell.
Oh, look.
And here's one of the Renault's instrument panel.
Uniquely fascinating.
That's the left-hand control stalk with main beam, wipe wash and hooter on it.
Oh, that's interesting!
And here's one of the right-hand control stalk with indicators and so forth.
Oh, I think this is gonna give me an erection.
Anyway, so we skirted round Souda Bay via Thalakos.
I discovered this marvellous little off-the-beaten-track taverna.
It really was so authentic.
Everyone there spoke...
- Really, you should have been there.
- Oh, no.
I shouldn't.
No, I shouldn't have been there.
No.
- This is one of me pointing at my moussaka.
- Oh, wait a second, isn't that a revolting sight?
because the whole new Minolta range have got self-timers.
Self-timers?
Oh, well, then I must leave at once.
I discovered this marvellous little man in Hadia who developed film the traditional Cretan way.
Nikos his name was, or Costas.
Could have been Andreas.
Oh, but I must find out.
Which?
Which was his name?
- This is him on the toilet.
- Go away!
Right.
Well, you touch my daughter again and it'll be a slide show.
You understand?
- Hello.
Both just got time to tell you...
- Just.
Just got time, yes.
We both, well, we both used to have problems around here, didn't we?
- Just around the eye area.
- Certainly did.
- Just there.
- And this area as well.
- Here and round there.
- That's right.
It was awful.
Our eyes just kept coming out, didn't they?
- Couldn't keep them in.
It was horrible.
- Ghastly.
Now, thankfully, it's all cleared up.
- It's stopped happening, hasn't it?
- Effectively, yes.
Yes, yes, they don't fall out anymore and we're pleased about that, aren't we?
- Delighted.
Yes.
- Hmm.
- Officer!
- Good morning, sir.
Would you like to take a seat?
- Is there a queue?
- Well, you may be more comfortable that way.
No.
I'm all right standing up, thanks.
My name's Oliver, by the way.
Excited to know you.
- Oh, Peter Franks.
- Hi, Peter.
Peter, listen would you like a coffee?
Filter, espresso, cappuccino.
We offer decaf on all of those.
Well, that's very kind.
Do you have a tea?
Tea...
I don't think so, Peter.
I'll just check that for you.
Hello, Mabel, my love.
It's Oliver here.
Listen, my darling, do we carry a tea machine?
- Sorry, dear.
- Yes, I thought not.
Many thanks, pet.
- Sorry, Peter, no tea.
- Oh, doesn't matter.
Don't worry.
- So, how may we help you?
- Well, this is a police station, isn't it?
- Well, of course it is, Peter.
Yes.
- Yes. 'Cause I tried to ring you earlier but you must have changed your number, all I got was music playing in my ear.
The thing is, my car's been stolen.
- Your car's been stolen?
- Yes.
Oh, Peter, I am sorry to hear that.
Aw.
And you'd like us to do something about it?
Well, yes, please.
Okay, well, have you had a look at our brochure, Peter?
If you'll pardon the pun.
What pun?
Wasn't there one?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, Peter, if you'd like to come with me, we'll go through it together.
Would you like to take a seat?
Now, Peter, we offer basically three kinds of stolen car recovery service.
That's the super, the lovely and the gorgeous.
Now, the super is a basic non-priority listing of your car.
The lovely is higher priority, and the gorgeous is A1 top priority.
We put all our team onto it, field and creative.
And that also includes a full waxing and valeting
- of your car on recovery.
- I see.
Obviously, Peter, the gorgeous is a more expensive service.
- I beg your pardon?
- Do you have an account with us?
- Account?
No.
- Oh, you're a shareholder, perhaps?
- Well, I'm a citizen, if that's what you mean.
- Citizen.
Oh, you mean client?
Look, I don't want to sound stupid, but I get back to England, I find my car's been stolen...
Peter, you've been away?
Did you perhaps miss the privatisation of the police force?
- The what?
- This is now a branch office of Brit Law PLC.
- Would you like to fill out a form?
- Fill out a form?
Fill out a form?
You mean fill in a form.
Has everyone suddenly turned American?
Now, Peter I shall need your address, I shall need your place and date of birth, your car registration number, and we should be able to have an account verified within 14 days.
- Subject to status.
- This is insanity.
I'm a taxpayer.
Peter, everybody had a chance to buy shares at the time of issue.
It was all supervised by a reputable merchant bank.
Well, by a merchant bank anyway.
- This is madness.
I'm leaving.
- No, Peter.
Not that way.
Not that way, Peter.
- What?
- That's the High Street.
- Yes?
- The High Street is owned by UK Highroads PLC.
We're employed by them to make sure that only those with valid roadway passes use the street.
But that's the Queen's highway for goodness sake, surely I can use that.
Queen's...?
Oh, you have shares in the Royal Family PLC.
That would be quite sufficient.
Shares in the...
No, of course I haven't.
Well, Peter, I'm afraid I must ask you to come with me to the restraining bar.
Now, if you'd just like to put your hands on the detention knob.
- But I haven't done anything.
- Not the gold member cuffs for you.
I'm afraid we'll have to use the bronze, Master Peter.
- No, no.
Absolutely...no.
No, I refuse.
No.
- Now, Peter.
Peter.
- Peter?
- What?
Well, you haven't changed that much, then.
Welcome to Argue the Toss.
My tosser this week is Simon Clituris.
Simon Clituris, you saw that sketch.
What did you think?
- Well, I thought the sketch worked on two levels.
- Only two?
Ah.
Yes, you're right.
I'm being simplistic.
I thought it worked on nine levels.
- I thought I spotted 12.
- Yes, yes.
Well, yes, 12 if you include the...
But, for heaven's sake, let's be condescending about this.
- Absolutely.
- I thought it worked, on the one hand, as a simple satire on modern Britain.
And on the other hand, as a metaphor for the problem of redemption.
- What about the underlying theme?
- Ah.
Which one?
Well, the underlying theme of a man desperately trying to recover his stolen car.
Well, that I thought was the least successful of all the underlying themes.
It didn't work for me.
- That's where the sketch really just disappeared.
- Simply vanished?
- Completely vanished.
- I see.
And the main characters?
Well, I felt I didn't know enough about them.
I was reminded of those occasions when one is asked to sleep with someone one doesn't know particularly well.
Consequently, I was nervous and the whole thing was a disappointment.
- In a word.
- Brilliant.
Simon Clituris, thank you very much.
Welcome to Up the Arts.
Martin Utrecht, you saw those critics there.
- Were you impressed by what they had to say?
- Let me say that it seems to me that what they were trying to achieve was essentially two-fold.
I don't think it would be quite fair to judge them on that small extract we just saw.
Good.
So what was your judgement of the small extract we just saw?
Well, it seems to me that they were trying to assess a comedy sketch, a humouresque routine...
Did that work for you?
For me, there was something about their criticism that was, I don't know, what's the word?
Sterile?
I was going to say fertile.
Hardly different.
No, I have to say it didn't work for me, no.
I think, on the one hand, they were trying to encompass too much.
They were overambitious.
I was going to say overcautious.
Yes.
Hardly different.
And, on the other hand, they were trying to present themselves as viable human beings
- attempting to make sense of their...of their, um...
- Environment?
I was going to say trousers.
Hardly different.
Trousers, environment.
Environment, trousers.
It's a kind of square.
I was gonna say circle.
Much the same thing.
And on the other hand...
Ah, you've got three hands.
- I've got three hands...
- They, of course, were doing a two-hander.
Would they have benefited from an extra hand?
Would that have come in...useful?
I feel with an extra hand, they might just have got away with it.
Did you enjoy their criticism?
Oh, I loved it.
I wanted to go to bed with it and kiss it in many soft, private, little places.
- So their future as critics, bulbous, would you say?
- Yes, perineal.
The exact word.
- So we're agreed?
- Of course not.
Hello, welcome to Oh, No, Not Another One.
Ofallthedeodorants, this is the one that I enjoy using most.
It feels real nice going on and it smells good and keeps me dry all day.
I don't have to worry about it cutting out in clutch moments.
All of the other ones are just...
I don't know.
They just never seem to hold up under pressure for me.
I can put this on once during the day and for the rest of the day I'm fine, I'm all set up.
I don't have to worry about, you know, social nervousness or anything.
It's just...
It keeps me feeling good and fresh and I love the smell.
I don't think there's any deodorant that comes close to this one.
I think it was Donald Mainstock, the great amateur squash player, who pointed out how lovely I was.
Until that time, I think it was safe to say that I had never really been aware of my own timeless brand of loveliness.
But his words smote me because, of course you see,
I am lovely in a fluffy moist kind of a way and who would have it otherwise?
I walk, let's be splendid about this, in a lightly accented cloud of gorgeousness that isn't far short of being, quite simply, terrific.
The secret of smooth almost shiny loveliness of the order of which we're discussing in this simple, frank, creamy soft way doesn't reside in oils, unguents, balms, ointments, creams, astringents, milks, moisturisers,
liniments, lubricants, embrocations or balsams, to be rather divine for just one noble moment.
It resides, and I mean this in a pink, slightly special way, in one's attitude of mind.
To be gorgeous and high and true and fine and fluffy and moist and sticky and lovely, all you have to do is to believe that one is gorgeous and high and true and fine and fluffy and moist and sticky and lovely.
And I believe it of myself, tremulously at first, and then with mounting heat and passion because, stopping off for a second to be super again, I'm so often told it.
That's the secret really.
Waiter.
- Sir?
- There's something wrong with my soup.
Oh, I wouldn't say that, sir.
It looks very smart to me.
What?
Nice pinstripe.
No, no.
No, my soup.
There's something wrong with my soup.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I thought you said suit.
It, um, tastes...odd, somehow.
- What does?
- My soup.
- Does it?
- Hmm.
- May I, sir?
- Please do.
Thank you.
- Seems all right to me.
- No.
No, my soup.
My soup tastes odd.
- Oh, your soup!
- Yes.
- Oh, dear!
- Taste it.
I just have, sir.
Not my suit.
I want you to try my soup.
Oh, I'd rather not if you don't mind, sir.
- Why not?
- Probably too long in the arms.
No, no, no.
What's the matter with you?
I'm talking about my soup.
S
- O-U-P.
- Oh, your soup!
- Yes!
- Is there something wrong with it, sir?
- Well, I've told you.
It tastes odd.
- Well, may I, sir?
- Please.
Thank you so much.
- Ah, yes.
- "Ah, yes" what?
It's the cyanide, sir.
I beg your pardon?
Chef does occasionally, in my opinion, tend to overstress the cyanide in his pottage.
Are you telling me that the chef has put cyanide in the soup?
No, sir, he's put cyanide in the soup.
- That's what I said.
- Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I thought you said suit.
This is outrageous!
Would you like me to bring you some soup without cyanide in it, sir?
- Yeah.
No, I mean...
- Or perhaps something else from the menu?
Well, why?
Why has the chef put cyanide in the soup?
He has a club foot, sir.
- What?
- The chef has a club foot.
Well, I've got a bent nose but I don't go around massacring perfectly innocent diners.
- There's no cyanide in the mozzarella salad, sir.
- Oh, yippee.
Just a hint of strychnine but not so as you'd notice.
Oh, this is absurd.
You're right.
It is completely ridiculous.
Well, would you like to be a comedy writer?
What's happened is that we've deliberately left this sketch without a tagging punch line.
Or ending, as we call it in the trade.
That's right.
Now, that's where you come in.
The lines are now open for you to phone in your payoff to this hilarious skitlet.
But just as an added difficulty, we're not actually going to give you the telephone number to ring.
No, that's right.
You have to use your skill and judgement to think up a witty, apt and amusing telephone number of your own.
And if British Telecom think it's funny enough, they'll put you through to our switchboard here.
Hello.
And we have a clear winner straightaway.
Mr JD Ward of Basildon.
Well, well done, JD Ward.
If you'll be so kind as to let us know your chest size, we'll send you a A Bit of Fry Laurie chequebook and pen straightaway.
- Well, let's go back to where we were, then.
- Right.
Oh, this is absurd.
You're right.
It is completely ridiculous.
The brown soup has no cyanide in it whatsoever, sir.
- The brown soup?
- That's right, sir.
No toxics, radioactive particles or microbes of any description?
Not a drop, sir.
- I'll have some of that, then.
- Right you are, sir.
Honestly.
Nice one, JD.
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
Mr Hugh Laurie has kindly agreed to embarrass us all with a song of his own composing entitled, quite simply, Mystery.
Mr Hugh Laurie.
Mystery.
# Mystery
# All my life has been a mystery
# You and I were never ever meant to be
# That's why I call my love for you a mystery
# Different country
# You and I have always lived in a different country
# And I know that airline tickets don't grow on a tree
# So what kept us apart is plain for me to see
# That much at least is not really a mystery
# Estuary
# I live in a houseboat on an estuary
# Which is handy for my work with the Thames Water Authority
# But I know you would have found it insanitary
# Insanitary
# Taken a violent dislike to me
# I'd be foolish to ignore the possibility
# That if we'd ever actually met you might have hated me
# Still, that's not the only problem that I can see
# Dead since 1973
# You've been dead now
# Wait a minute, let me see
# Fifteen years come next January
# As a human being, you are history
# So why do I still long for you?
# Why is my love so strong for you?
# Why did I write this song for you?
# Well, I guess it's just a mystery
# Mystery #
Mr Marsh?
Mmm-hmm.
Would you like me to take your bags up to your executive suite, Mr Marsh?
Oh, no, thanks very much.
I'm gonna be checking out in the morning...
Gordon Inglis, as I live and close a sale, you crazy old buffalo.
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Oh, Stuart Marsh, you turbo-charged son of a mass retailer.
How are you?
Well, I'm hanging pretty tough, Gordon.
Hanging pretty tough.
What about yourself?
Things not going so well, eh?
Oh, no.
I'm strictly moving to the rhythm, Stu.
Why do you ask?
Why do I ask?
Well, Gordon, really.
I mean, being a porter in a hotel, it's hardly the big time, is it?
No...
Stuart, that was a joke.
Oh, well, then!
Blimey, that's nice.
I like that very much.
Yeah, very good.
So tell me, you old roister-doister, what the hell are you doing in Telford?
The last I heard you were based out of Peterborough.
Yeah, I did a spell in Peterborough, Gordon.
It's part of a big new management shake up, but right now I'm fixing up to meet with old Derek Clark.
Derek "the Fiddler" Clark?
# If I was a rich man #
The man's a legend.
So tell me, you're gonna be working under Derek Clark now, is that it?
Well, not so much under, Gordon, more kind of alongside.
I'm gonna be a sort of flexible, highly-resourced, independently-targeted, free-range trouble-shooter, if you like.
Free-range?
Sounds challenging.
Anyway, he and I are supposed to be having a working breakfast together.
I'd ask you to join us, Gordon, but, you know...
Oh, no Sweatsville, Idaho, Stu.
So tell me, do they do a good working breakfast here?
I don't believe I've ever actually working-breakfasted at this hotel before.
They only do the best working breakfast in the state of Telford, Gordon.
Waiter.
Gordon, you'll take some coffee, surely.
Well, I don't know.
How does the coffee perform?
Oh, the coffee performs okay, Gordon.
Don't you worry about that.
Waiter, pot of coffee for two.
Make sure it's hot, strong and in a pot.
Okay?
For two.
If you see Mr Clark, tell him I'm in the executive breakfast lounge, will you?
How will I know Mr Clark, sir?
I beg your pardon.
How will I recognise Mr Clark?
Are you trying to be funny?
Derek Clark, he's...
You know, his lapel badge.
He's with Unitec.
- Lapel badge!
- Yes, sir.
And he's to meet you in the breakfast lounge.
In the executive breakfast lounge.
- There's only one breakfast lounge, sir.
- Yes, and it's the executive breakfast lounge!
Right.
I'll tell him, sir.
Hey, sonny.
Come here.
If you've got any thoughts about making it in the hotel business, then you better just watch your lip, okay?
That's all.
- I'm sorry...
- That's all.
Thank you.
That's all.
Thank you very much, waiter!
That is all.
The kid's just green, Stu.
Oh, Gordon, when you and I were green... we didn't go around giving lip to busy senior executives.
No, we used to give them a bit of tongue from time to time.
- So, looks like Derek Clark stood you up.
- No, it's all right.
He rang down and said he was having a bit of trouble with the trouser press in his room.
It's an executive trouser press, you see.
Derek tried to put an ordinary leisure trouser on it and, not surprisingly, the machine wouldn't play.
- What a son of a bitch.
- Yeah.
So what about yourself, Gordon.
What's keeping you off the streets these days?
Well, actually, I've gone into business for myself, Stuart.
Yeah?
I hope you're taking good advice.
The very best.
I've got hold of a new kind of bank account.
It's called...
Smug.
I wish you the very best of luck, Gordon.
I really do, because you and I, hey, we go all the way back.
Oh, right the way back to the end zone, Stu.
You know what they used to call us back in Reading?
- What was that?
- The wild dogs of retailing.
- Wild dogs.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
You and I, we broke a few moulds in our time, eh, Gordon?
- Yeah, and a few eggs.
- Yeah.
- Eggs?
- You can't make an omelette...
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can.
- Not without breaking eggs.
So what if I can't, Gordon?
I mean, I'm a busy man.
My talents lie in other directions.
No, no.
I mean, you can't make an omelette without breaking eggs.
What is this, Cookery Corner?
I don't need this, Gordon, all right?
I'm about to have a working breakfast with the toughest divisional sales manager since Moses and all of a sudden you're giving me a list of all the things I can't do!
Thanks for the support, partner.
- No, Stu, I only meant...
- What am I supposed to say?
"Derek, I'm not right for this job, choose someone else.
I can't make an omelette."
- No, you can, Stu.
But not without...
- It's delegation, Gordon.
I don't have the time.
I want an omelette, I go to an omelette-maker.
Does that make me a failure?
All right, I'm a failure.
I can't make an omelette without breaking eggs.
Well, no one can, Stu.
That's the point.
It's impossible.
- What do you mean, it's impossible?
- It can't be done.
What do you think I've been eating all these years?
I had an omelette last night.
Yeah, but they broke the eggs.
I hardly think they'd use broken eggs in executive room service, Gordon.
Do you know what I'd like to know?
- Have you told me before?
- No.
Then how can I possibly?
I'd like to know why, oh, why, oh, why the word gay has been so ruthlessly hijacked from our beloved English language.
I agree with your question 100%.
- Gay used to be such a lovely word.
- A lovely word.
Yes.
You can't use it anymore.
It's been taken away from us.
That's right.
No longer can ordinary people, such as we, use an ordinary word, like gay, in an ordinary example of the great British sentence.
Without people thinking that you mean poofy.
It's a disgrace.
Damn shame.
And there's another one, you see?
Poofy.
You can't say that anymore.
- Of course you can't.
- Used to.
- All the time.
- Yes, but now...
- Now.
- ...people think you mean arse bandit.
Arse bandit.
There you go again, you see?
- Well, of course you do.
- You know, arse bandit.
- Perfectly decent couple of words.
- That's right.
- Used to use them every day.
- So did I.
"Would you care to have a go on the arse bandit?" One used to ask, quite innocently.
Yes.
Yes, or, "Back in a moment, darling.
I'm just taking the arse bandit to the menders."
Yeah.
- But now, of course...
- Nowadays.
- ...people think you mean homosexual.
- Right.
- And there's another one.
- Yeah.
When was the last time you could use the word homosexual in its proper context?
- Right, and it's such a lovely word.
- Oh, it's one of the great words.
"My word, Jane," I used to say to my wife, "the garden's looking very homosexual this morning."
Quite right.
Quite right.
Lovely word.
One of the great words.
Always were.
"Landlord, I'll have two foaming pints of your most homosexual beer, thank you."
"Oh, and a packet of arse bandits as well."
Right.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes. "And keep the change."
- Right.
- Yes.
- But now...
- Nowadays.
- People just laugh at you.
- That's right.
Oh, well, I'm off to the dry-cleaner's to pick up a couple of screaming benders.
- Are you coming?
- I don't see why not.
Then we can get them home and go to bed with them.
- That's right.
- That's right.
Morning.
You're ugly.
No.
Um...
We're not...
We're not doing that one.
No.
If you remember, I didn't like it.
I thought that was quite funny, that one.
- Yes.
Yes, we'll be doing this one instead.
- Right.
All right then.
Right.
Huh.
I can see you've fallen in love already, sir.
- Oh, hello.
Yes, I was just looking at the...
- The Aston Martin.
Isn't she beautiful?
To be honest with you, that's the best car in the place, that one.
Out of all of them, that is the best one in the place.
Only come in Tuesday, as a matter of fact.
Obviously it's not for me.
It's for my nephew.
- It's his birthday tomorrow.
He'll be nine.
- Yeah, that's nice.
And he told me he's set his heart on an Aston Martin so...
Yeah, well, you know, who wouldn't?
To be honest with you, if I had the money, that is the one I would...
You know, for my own personal use, I would choose that one.
- You can have a go on it if you want.
- Really?
Yeah, sure.
I'll get it out for you.
- Goes a bit, doesn't it?
- Yeah.
Sounds a bit rough to me.
Yeah, that's 'cause you're not getting your tongue far enough back in your throat.
That's why.
- Like that, you see?
- Oh, right.
Yeah.
Oh, yes.
Good.
So how much is it?
The Aston Martin DB6 Plantagenet silver.
Oh, that's £4.
- £4?
- Yeah.
And it's one owner.
Immaculate history.
It's not new, then?
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
No, you won't get a new Aston for £4.
That is cheap.
That is a good price.
For an Aston, £4 is cheap.
I'm telling you.
Obviously, we make sure that the vehicle is completely immaculate before it goes out of here.
We do a complete five-point check on the vehicle.
We clean and polish it... and then we do the other four things that are included in the five-point check.
Basically, we do everything that is humanely possible to the car.
Look, if you're not sure, you know, why not bring your nephew in?
You know, if he knows about Astons.
Maybe he'd like to have a look underneath it.
We can have a look underneath it now if you want.
- Clean.
Yeah.
- It is clean.
It is clean.
Yes.
Do you exchange?
- Well, what's he got at the moment?
- A tractor.
Well, I'll be lucky to shift a tractor by new year.
Maybe 40p.
He is very fond of his tractor.
All right, then.
It's his birthday.
You're an ugly bastard. 50p.
I'd just like to tell you about this cigarette case.
It used to belong to my grandfather on my parents' side.
He was given it by his god-niece as a kind of loss of virginity present, really.
He took it with him to Flanders in 1912 when he went there on holiday.
Then he took it again in 1915 when he went to fight in the war.
Now, what grandfather used to do is he would keep cigarettes in it like this.
And if he wanted one, he would simply take it out, smoke it and close the case again.
Now, he used to keep his cigarette case here, in the breast pocket of his field tunic, or battle blouse.
Now, one day grandfather had to go over the top, out of the trenches into action and he was shot by a German sniper clean through the temple.
Now, if grandfather had worn his cigarette case here... um... it would have an unpleasant dent in it... and I'd be alive today.
Oh, that's...
That's brilliant, that is.
That's fantastic.
What?
The wars are funny now, are they?
The First Worid War was just a joke to you, I suppose, was it?
Well, yes, not very well-told.
Oh, right, so the Great War and Worid War II were just vast entertainments laid on for your benefit, were they?
Well, if you put it that way, then obviously yes.
Do you know, I wonder, what it's like to die?
- Erm...no, I don't, actually.
- No, right.
But do you think it's funny that millions of people died for you?
I don't think millions of people did die for me.
They didn't know me.
I wasn't born.
They happened to be dying for generations yet unborn,
- which I think includes you.
- Yes, but they didn't know that, did they?
They didn't go into battle shouting,
"Let's die for Stephen Fry who may or may not be born one day."
- They were just obeying orders.
- Oh, forget it.
Forget it.
Sick, you are.
Sick.
Well, I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
I mean, the fact is I am sick.
But I don't think even Hugh knows quite how sick I am.
The fact is, and this is something only Hugh's closest friends are aware of, that he has been suffering now for sometime from a gradual but persistent deterioration in his eyesight.
Normally, it's absolutely fine.
No one would ever know.
He learns the position of all the furniture, all the props on stage and no one could ever guess.
But today, so sick am I, I just went out this morning and moved everything here just...
Oh, dear.
I'm sorry.
It was sick of me.
As you can see, he's completely disoriented.
I don't know...
I don't know why I did it.
I'm sorry.
It was sick of me.
- All right.
Come on, let's get on with it.
- Sorry.
On with the sketch.
Soldiers are...
Now, I don't know how to tell you this so I'm going to have to come straight out with it.
- I'm afraid I can't let you go on the escape.
- I'm sorry, sir?
- I can't let you go on the escape.
- Well, why not, sir?
Because, Whitlow, because you're blind.
That's why not.
- No, I'm not, sir.
- You're blind, Whitlow, and I can't jeopardise the lives of 14 other prisoners just because one of the members of the escape party happens to be blind.
- Pardon, sir?
- I said, I can't...
- What's the matter?
Are you deaf?
- Yes, sir.
- You're deaf and blind?
- No, just deaf, sir.
No, you're blind as well, Whitlow.
You keep bumping into things.
Oh, that!
Oh, well, that's just a joke, sir.
It's not very funny, is it?
Well, the chaps like it, sir.
- If you'll pardon the pun.
- What pun?
- Wasn't there a pun?
Oh, I'm sorry.
- No.
All right, you claim you can see.
I have here, Whitlow, an electric carving knife.
I'm going to plug it in, switch it on and throw it at you.
If you don't drop it, I'll let you go on the escape.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that, sir.
I haven't thrown it yet.
Actually, I was telling a bit of a lie just now.
- Ah, you mean you're not deaf?
- No, I mean I am blind.
- You're blind and deaf?
- Pardon?
Well, I can't very well let you go on the escape if you're deaf and blind, now can I?
It was a forlorn hope, sir, yes.
Just a moment.
If you're deaf, how can you hear what I'm saying?
- I can lip-read, sir.
- Ah, I see.
Lip-read?
- But you're blind!
- Pardon?
How can you read my lips if you're blind?
Oh, well, it's because I'm deaf, sir, that my sense of vision is naturally enhanced.
Blind people are known to have very keen hearing.
So they sort of cancel each other out, sir.
- You mean you can see and hear perfectly?
- Yes, because I'm blind and deaf.
One miraculously compensates for the other.
You poor beggar, but I still can't let you go on the escape.
It's because I'm dumb, isn't it, sir?
- It's a talker's world.
- What are you talking about?
- If you can't talk, you're nobody, nothing.
A zero.
- Whitlow, shut up.
They think it means I'm stupid, but I've got ideas...
Be quiet, Whitlow.
You're not coming on this escape.
If it's because I can't smell, sir.
You are not coming on this escape and that is final.
But, sir, I lost my sense of smell while forging the minutest details of a thousand Nazi documents.
I know that, Whitlow, but you can't come because you're a bastard and we hate you.
- We don't want you to come.
- Oh, fair enough, sir.
Oh, hi, Bradley.
I just looked in to see if I couldn't have a borrow of your garden sprinklie.
Oh, sure, mate.
Help yourself.
It's over there in the coolie.
Thanks, mate.
By the way, how are Javelina and Trevelin these days?
Jings, mate, don't reopen old wounds.
Was I doing that, Craig?
Was I reopening old wounds?
- Old sores?
- You certainly were.
Listen, Shane, a word to the wise.
If you wanna re-establish your relationship with those two, you've got to stop running away from yourself.
Jings, mate, don't you think I know that?
Don't you think I've tried not running away from myself?
It seems like every time I look out the window, there I go haring down the street.
- Away from yourself?
- Away from myself, precisely.
How does Donna feel about this?
Owen, I'm gonna ask you man to man, leave Donna out of this.
All right, I'm sorry.
Keep your sweat on.
It's okay, mate.
It's just that ever since Morwenna's graphic design studio went down the tubes,
I just seem to have withdrawn right into myself.
Oh, heck, Findley.
You can't blame yourself for that.
Sean over-capitalised.
You warned him time and time enough.
Yeah, but performance is the bottom line, Clark, and I hold myself accountable in no small measure.
Well, how do you think I feel, Declan, for crike's sakes, eh?
I personally underwrote the equity on Yvonne's marital boutique.
It's my ass on the bottom line, too, you know.
Listen, you leave Yvonne out of this, all right?
Jings, mate, I'm sorry.
God, it's pretty stuffy in here.
Why don't we get some fresh air?
Sure, mate, help yourself.
There's some air freshener in the dunnie over there.
Oh, by the way, I know what it was I wanted to say to you.
We're having a barbie tomorrow night.
Do you want to come along?
You leave Barbie out of this!
No, a barbecue.
It's to celebrate the opening of Morkwinda's new executive fitness centre and garage.
- Do you want to come?
- Sounds great.
Okay, then.
- Oh, Jims!
- What?
I've just seen Joycie coming up the pathie.
Oh, Jims!
Listen, there's something I've been discussing with Castella and Lilette.
And I'd rather that, you know, Joycie and Lenore didn't find out about it.
What?
Spit it out, mate, she's almost here.
Look, I don't know how to tell you this, mate.
It's hard for me to say.
The fact is...
I've been having, well, affair, it's the only word.
I've been having an affair with you for sometime now.
- What?
- It's true.
You bastard!
Look, mate, you had to find out sooner or later and I'd just rather it came from me, that's all.
You mean we've been sleeping together all this time?
Behind my back?
I've said I'm sorry.
I don't know what else I can say.
The fact is that...
I was vulnerable and you were there.
You leave me out of this!
I've said I'm sorry.
I just don't know what else I can say, mate.
Why am I always the last one to know?
It won't happen again, Vin.
I promise.
I just wish that if you were gonna sleep with me, you could at least have done it to my face.
I'll bear that in mind for next time.
The truth is, mate, I was confused and slightly bewildered.
I'd just discovered that Durnik isn't my real father.
He isn't!
Well, then who is?
I am.
- Then that must mean that you must be...
- Exactly.
Devlin's half-sister's wife's doctor's cousin's niece.
Well, then who the hell am I?
I don't know, mate, but it's your round.
Loosely based on a short story by Frederic Brown
Unbelievable.
You're just like your father.
That's the third time in the subject of geometry.
It would take a miracle.
A miracle, I tell you!
If only your father had listened!
Are you misunderstood by your family?
- Mom.
- The stars are not in your favor...
This is the last time I'll retake that geometry exam.
...of wonderful silver.
Don't forget dinner.
"To protect yourself from the invocation of a greater demon... place yourself at the center of a pentagon... drawn with your own blood.
This pentagon will be your only protection.
No!
Don't step on it!
This pentagon is my only protection.
Protection against what?
Your closet is really small.
I called you because I don't want to take the geometry test again.
And my father died in an accident three months ago.
And I want him back.
I want him here.
Okay.
Okay, what?
Okay, he's here.
But where?
Francesco.
Mom, no!
Mom...
In the name of God and all the saints, go back to hell where you came from.
Look on the bright side.
It's your turn now.
You can't come inside the pentagon.
Listen, kid.
I granted your first wish.
You wanted your family to be reunited.
Resistance is useless.
Your second wish was about the geometry test.
So allow me to tell you that a pentagon, magic or not,
What you drew has six sides, and is called a "hexagon."
- Hexagon?
- Look on the bright side.
You won't have to take the geometry test ever again.
It's not fair.
No, it isn't.
Life is like a hurricane

Ooh-ooh
Hey, ho, where are we going?
Nobody knows but we're willing to go!
Hey, ho, where we been?
Nobody knows if we'll come back again!
Keep in step, Junior Woodchucks, and follow me.
Oops!
- Oops!
- Oops!
- Oops!
- Oops!
Oops!
Hey, fellow Junior Woodchucks, ...wait up!
Oops!
Our troop earns more merit badges!
That's because we are the baddest!
- What are we?
- The baddest!
What are we gonna do?
Earn our geology merit badges!
Whoa-oa-oa-oa!
Thanks for waiting up, guys.
Let's make camp.
Set up your tents, Junior Woodchucks.
Doofus, why don't you go gather some firewood and get dinner started?
Will do, Woodchuck leader!
That Doofus - he's never gonna win a merit badge, unless they start giving them out for messing up!
I may not be very good at hiking and marching and setting up tents, but I sure know how to gather firewood.
Uh-oh.
Yeow!
We're gonna win a tent-raising merit badge for sure this year.
I'm starving!
When do we eat?
Doofus should be back with the firewood any minute.
Oh, no!
- Look out!
- Yikes!
Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa!
Can I gather firewood, or what?
Well, Junior Woodchucks, looks like we sleep under the stars tonight.
Star Police still gaining on us.
We can defeat them with powers of stolen energy crystal.
How much longer before it activates?
24 time units.
Too long.
Hide, we must, the energy crystal.
Yeah, this puny planet, good as any is.
If Star Police search us, clean we will be.
Return we will when Star Police gone.
It's gold, isn't it, Launchpad?
No, it's listed in the Junior Woodchuck Guidebook, Huey.
But it isn't gold.
It's pyrite.
Fool's gold.
Fool's gold.
Doofus should have been the one to find it!
Where is Doofus?
Golly, if I don't find something soon,
I won't get my geology merit badge, either.
Ouch!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Hot!
Ooh.
Gee, this looks like geology to me.
That ought to cool it off.
Wow!
A diamond doughnut!
No, it's not a diamond.
Or a doughnut, either.
I'm afraid it's not listed in the Junior Woodchuck Guidebook anywhere.
I'm sorry, Doofus.
I can't give you your geology merit badge.
I'll keep looking.
Gee, little buddy, we have to get going if we wanna get back to Camp Woodchuck before dark.
Oh, well.
I'll just keep it for good luck.
It sure has been lucky for him so far.
Everybody got a geology merit badge but him.
- Star Police fooled, we have.
- Yes.
Return to puny planet, we can.
Recover stolen energy crystal, we will.
When crystal activates, powerful we will become.
"We"? "We"?
Only the one who holds the crystal, powerful becomes.
Cannot both of us hold crystal at same time?
"Both"? "Both"?
I will hold the crystal!
I will rule the puny planet and rest of this puny galaxy.
Hey, ho, where are we going?
Nobody knows but we're willing to go!
Hey, ho, where have we been?
Nobody knows, but we've come back again!
Last one in the showers is a rotten Woodchuck.
Should we wait for Doofus, or do you wanna take a shower and get a good night's sleep first?
Here he comes!
He keeps up pretty well when he's not carrying all our food.
He's still carrying most of it.
Sorry I'm so slow.
Just one of the many reasons why I'm never gonna win a merit badge.
Ah, come on, little buddy, you got to believe in yourself.
Keep telling yourself you can do it until you believe it.
Is that how you won all your merit badges, Launchpad?
Uh-huh.
It's a very scientific principle called
"thinking positive."
Gee, Launchpad, you sure are smart!
Are you positive?
Just look at it this way.
Tomorrow is another day.
- See you in the morning!
- Good night!
Thanks for the advice.
The energy crystal, gone it is!
Our stolen crystal has been stolen!
Soon energy crystal will activate.
Follow, we must, this thief.
Cosmic tracking light straight to him will lead us.
Come on, Doofus, put out the light, will you?
I'm studying for tomorrow's merit badge test.
Doofus, go to sleep!
All right, all right!
Doofus, put out that light!
Oh, gee, Mom, this new bed sure is soft.
Huh?
Huh?
Oh, wow!
What a dream!
Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa!
Oh, help me!
Ooh!
Whoa, how'd I do that?
My lucky doughnut!
It's glowing!
Yikes!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa!
I can run faster than lightning!
My lucky doughnut must be magic!
Ha-ha!
I'm super-strong, too!
I wonder.
Yahoo!
Wait till the guys see this!
Hey, guys, guess what.
I have super powers!
I can fly!
Good, Doofus, then either go to sleep or go to Mars!
- No, really -
- Doofus, go to sleep!
But... hm.
Maybe it's better if nobody knows I have super powers just yet.
I could win every merit badge there is if I keep it a secret.
I can't run too fast or show them how strong I really am.
Better not fly right away, either.
Doofus, put out that light!
What's the matter, Doofus?
Aren't you even going to try for your knot-tying merit badge?
Just waiting my turn, fellow Woodchucks.
Hah, big man!
Come on, fellow Woodchump, show us your stuff.
I dare you.
Hey, what are you...?
Huh?
Watch it!
Hey!
Quackaroonie!
Wow, I didn't know you could tie knots like that, Doofus.
It's all in the wrists - and thinking positively, of course.
Well, you got your knot-tying merit badge, little buddy.
Wanna go for your knot-untying merit badge?
I'm going to sew my merit badges on this Junior Woodchuck merit-badge sash.
There won't be enough room for them all on my shirt!
That's thinking positive, little buddy.
Aw!
OK, hotshot, let's see you do it!
I guess you guys just don't know how to think positive.
I'm really proud of you, little buddy.
So am I, big buddy.
Gee, Doofus is gonna win every merit badge there is.
Yeah, so why aren't we happier for him?
'Cause something weird is going on, and I think it's Doofus.
We better keep an eye on him.
Thinking positive sure works, fellow Woodchucks.
One more, and I become the all-time Woodchuck merit-badge champion!
Uh, all right, Junior Woodchucks, let's, uh, break for lunch.
Oh, boy!
One of my three favorite meals!
See, the crystal in that structure is.
Fire-devastator missile.
All but crystal will be destroyed.
- Oops.
Ha-ha.
Backwards was.
- "Oops"? "Oops"?
Uh-huh?
Ya-ha-ha!
What merit badge are we going for next, Woodchuck leader?
Fire!
We did that one already, big buddy.
Forest fire!
It's heading straight for Camp Woodchuck!
Gee, I could save Camp Woodchuck.
But if Launchpad finds out I have super powers, he might take away all my merit badges.
I know what I need!
A disguise!
A superhero disguise!
Faster than a flying saucer!
Stronger than 100 gorillas!
Able to jump over mountains on one foot!
It's Superdoo!
Everybody, line up for a Woodchuck bucket brigade!
There's only one problem, Launchpad.
No buckets!
Hey!
Who-who-who's that?
Lucky for you, it's Superdoo!
Superdoo?
He's lifting the water tower!
But not the water!
No danger too big, no disaster too small for the one, the only Superdoo!
Gosh, a real superhero.
With a pot belly and glasses?
- He reminds me of Doofus.
- Say, where is Doofus?
Ah, he's probably just off somewhere practicing snide remarks.
Come on, let's find the little merit-badge champion.
Ahh...
New plan, we need.
Mm...
New plan, I have!
Huey, I know Doofus has been acting strange lately, but a superhero?
Well, then where is he?
Hello, fellow Woodchucks.
What's been going on?
Dinoblast charge set.
Good.
Entire alien settlement will be destroyed by wave of crushing liquid.
Energy crystal soon will be ours.
And we will become most powerful criminals in universe.
- How long before dinoblast?
- Ten phlarns.
Ten phlarns?
Maybe nine.
Boy, the basket-weaving merit badge must be the hardest one there is.
I thought it was a little too easy, actually.
Why, you overstuffed...
The dam!
It must have busted!
We got to warn the camp!
Looks like another job for Superdoo!
Everybody get to higher ground!
Hurry!
Where's that superhero when you need him?
There!
And now to make good use of my pottery merit badge know-how!
Ha-ha!
It's stronger than it ever was, thanks to...
Superdoo!
Aha!
Well, so much for Superdoo's secret identity.
Uh, alien settlement is undamaged.
How about you?
Yeah...
But what difference does it make?
Woodchucks are supposed to earn their merit badges with practice and hard work.
With super powers, hard work is easy.
That lucky doughnut of yours sure has changed you, Doofus.
No foolin'!
Ever since you became super, you've been making fun of everybody!
Like you are better than the rest of us or something.
I am!
Sure, Doofus.
Anything you say.
Aw, you guys are just jealous, that's it!
You're jealous!
You liked me better when I was slow and clumsy.
- You're right!
- Oh, who needs you guys?
A superhero can make all the friends he wants.
Hi.
You guys want to be my friends?
After all, I saved your lives.
Aw, get lost, showoff!
Yeah, find somebody else to make fun of.
There's nothing that says you can't be a superhero and a Junior Woodchuck.
I guess you're the new merit-badge champion.
Great!
Who was the old merit-badge champion, anyway?
I was.
Gee, sorry, big buddy, but you know how it is.
I'm a superhero, and you...
well, you're just a hero.
But we can still be friends.
Wanna arm-wrestle?
- Huh?
Uh, no, thanks, Doofus.
- Superdoo.
Ah, Superdoo.
I'd, uh, rather be alone.
Being a superhero isn't so super.
And making fun of others wasn't as much fun as I thought it would be, either.
I wish I'd never found this stupid thing!
Ugh!
New plan, we need.
Use head, we must.
Well, that's the end of the short, unhappy career of Superdoo.
- Feel anything?
- No.
Youch!
- Hello, big buddy.
- Oh, uh, hi there, Superdoo.
Well, I've been thinking.
I didn't earn these merit badges, the doughnut did.
I want to give them back.
You know, it takes more than super power to make a decision like that.
I'm proud of you, little buddy.
Hello, fellow Woodchucks.
Doofus!
Where's your magic doughnut?
Threw it away.
Gee, you mean you gave up being Superdoo?
Yeah.
I gave back all my merit badges, too.
Gee, we're really glad to hear it, Doofus.
But what if there's another disaster or something?
Aw, how often does that happen?
Timber wolves!
- Doofus, run!
- What's he doing?
You did it, Doofus!
And you did it without your magic doughnut, fellow Woodchuck.
The children were never seen again, and the lost mine was never found.
But on still nights like this, people swear they've heard the old ghost miner walking these very woods, rattling the pans he used for panning gold.
Doofus!
Thought you might like me to pop you some popcorn, fellow Woodchucks.
Well, looks like the old Doofus is back for good.
I wouldn't have it any other way.
Weird thing is, neither would he.
Once upon a time, a city in the south of France
Need a hand?
- I don't need help.
Give it back
Don't be scared, I won't steal it.
- Leave me alone
Congratulations to your sister
Don't look at me like that I know who you are
You don't believe me?
But it's true
Here, this is you, right?
Who gave you this?
Someone who talks of you In his own way that is
I've known you for a while Here keep it
36 is on the other side
Jeanne

Noureddine, my husband
Well, kiss each other
Hello miss
She'll need to change
- Of course
We live here with other families Noreddine renovated the house
I didn't think you'd come
It's my first trip but I think it'll be the last.
I hate this city
You haven't see anything and you hate it already.
You haven't changed
I brought you something
Here, my wedding gift
I can't
Mom gave you this before she died.
I can't accept it
I have nothing else to give you
- You're here
It's the best gift I could have
How can you live in that house all alone?
I'm happy there I couldn't live anywhere else
How about this one?
- If you want
You can change here
I'd like to see Alain
- Please, not now
He's quiet for once.
If he knows you're there, we'll lose him again
You locked him in?
We had to.
Otherwise he escapes, gets in trouble
I'll tell you about it later
I beg you don't ruin this day
I just want to see him
Wait until the party's over, ok?
Promise?
Yeah
Here, you must be starving
- Not really, I ate at the station
You took the train?
- Yeah and I hitched
Don't worry about me you have guests
You could have told me she was coming
- I didn't know, she never leaves home
I'm so happy she's there
Where will she sleep?
- We'll find room
Watch out, your lipstick
Dance, dance, tomorrow you may die
You should thank Mr. Klotz He took care of your brother
At least he tried
- There's no need
Come sit with us, Mr Klotz don't stay with the girls
Don't thank me for your brother
I was wrong
- What happened?
He ran away, I brought him back.
I shouldn't have
Who's the french guy?
Family?
- No, I don't have any
What is he doing with the girls.
Is he drunk?
I don't know
Why is he here?
- I don't know, I tell you
He's a friend of Said I don't want to hear about it
You're not like your bother He's always laughing
Why are you so sad?
I'm not sad
- Of course you are
In life, you're either drunk or sad
Do you know the Koran?
Surat 103, the shortest
By destiny, man is lost.
That's clear to me
Don't just stand there, here, drink.
I brought my own supply
Better than lemonade
Don't think of your brother
- I haven't seen him in 3 months
I know he shouldn't stay here
Come dance with us
I don't know how
- You don't need to, come
I came to bring you back
We'll live together like before
Ok?
No
You want to stay here in this house?
Where?
Outside?
What do you do outside?
What are you doing?
You take... you steal?
You can't do that
Who taught you?
Your brother
You don't have a brother
Come
Come closer
You want me to get fired?
- Alain's gone, he disappeared
Shit, it's starting again
Noureddine knows?
- No, I wanted to tell you first
Good, I don't want to bother him
Do something
- You think I can just leave work?
I don't have time, can't you see?
Look, I'll meet you in the square at twelve, ok?
It happened before.
He's with Said.
- Who's Said?
A thief?
He's scum.
Don't worry about Alain, Klotz will bring him back
You don't seem to care
I'm sick of Alain.
He should never have come here
I thought he came because he missed me.
I'm so stupid
He just wanted to be fed and cleaned after
You're the same.
I thought you came for my wedding
But you came for Alain.
- You're crazy, that's not true
#I came for you too
I don't believe you or anyone else I could die, it wouldn't matter
It was the same when we were kids
Damn, I forgot about him
Wait here
I can't make it today
- But I borrowed a friend's house
I'll explain tomorrow
- Tomorrow I can't
I'm sick of people ruining my life
Don't look at me like that
I got married to have a child, that's all
In the meantime, I intend to be happy
When I make love, I feel good.
It's my only pleasure, I'm not like you
I can't spit on that, you understand?
- Of course.
Go for it, he's waiting
Bah, I don't feel like it anymore
What will you do now?
Look for Alain.
I'm sure I'll find him
Where?
I don't even know where Said lives
No one knows
Except Klotz, maybe
Hi
The buzzer is broken
You know the people who live here?
It's my house.
Well, my parent's house
You want to see them?
I'd like to speak with Mr. Klotz
He's not here
I'll wait
You might wait for a long time
It's been two days since we saw him
You had an appointment?
- No
Where can I find him?
Its urgent
You have a car?
If it's urgent, I can take you there
I'll finish my exercise and we'll go
Four
I can't do more than four
I used to do thirty.
But since my accident, it clenches
Don't you feel like swimming?
- No.
I didn't come for that
Don't be angry if I try to keep you here
I haven't seen people in a while
It's been six months
We have to go around
It's awful, this heat I can't bear it
And I used to like it
Before the accident?
It's not really an accident
I was killed
I was dead
It lasted three months, the coma, darkness
Now I'm trying to wake up.
But I can't
I'll never be like I was
Never
You'll be better here than in the sun
I'll get changed
Are you thirsty?
I made lemonade
No thanks
Hi
I don't know who you are and I don't want to.
But thank you
It's the first time I see my son happy in six months
Stay as long as you wish
Don't stand there, come sit down
You like fruits?
It helps with the heat
I almost want to kiss you
I'll leave you alone
Did she bother you?
I have ridiculous parents there's nothing to be done
And you?
Are you from around here?
- I live up north.
A small town
It's my first trip
What do you do up there?
I live with my brother
I take care of him, since my parents died.
I came to fetch him
He's on vacation here.
I guess I am too, I'm not used to it
Do you work there?
In a retirement home
You only see old folks, then
That's awful
I like it.
I don't really like young people
I'm sorry, I'm kind of in a rush
Let's go
Stephane, what are you doing?
You're not leaving?
It's working.
I haven't used it in a while
You're too weak.
You can't drive
Get out of here.
Get out
It can't start again
- God, you piss me off
You're tiring me
Wait
Wait, don't leave
It's nothing
Wait for me outside, I want to come
Wait for me, I'm coming
Give me the key
It's too early
I know it is hard but the doctor...
- The doctor says what you want
I can't stand it
Listen.
Listen carefully
If you don't give me the key right now
You'll never see me again
You know I'll do it
Coming?
Are you afraid?
- That's right, I'm afraid
If we crash, we'll die together
- I care about life
I care about you so I'll be careful
If you give me the address I'll find it on my own
He's at the theater, downtown
Sorry to bother you
It's not that, it's you health
You think I'm sick too?
I had you wrong
Wait
It doesn't work
It doesn't work at all
We'll have a break, five minutes
Be my guest
With this heat, I need to Did you see the contract?
At least today, I came for something
- Contract my ass.
You want some?
They hand me this crap because no one else wants it
A circus fanfare to play Mozart No thanks.
I may need money, but...
- Look I need that money, so sign it
You can't force me
- This time I'll pay you back
I know it'll be a bad concert
I can't do that seriously, six thousand
It's the last time I ask you But it can't wait
I need it now
What do you mean, now?
I'm leaving
What do you mean you're leaving?
Leaving where?
Don't stand here naked, go get dressed
What's this about you want to leave?
I'm going home.
To Algers
You can't do this to me
- You really don't know me, do you?
If you leave, I'll come after you You don't know me either
You'll get nothing from me
I fuck your kind but I'll never fuck you
It's not cause you're old and ugly That I don't mind
It's for something else Something I never told you
When I'm gone I'll tell you.
I'll write
I don't think you'll want to follow me
I waited for you all day, that's why I went to the wedding
I told you not to touch me
I'll have you one day
Even if it takes me a lifetime
Quit it
I learned your piece, listen
Let's start over, everyone
You lacked precision.
And grace Frankly, it lacked a bit of everything
So.
Second movement.
Adagio
And we play to the end
My brother, you know where he is?
He's at my place
I can't stay
What happened?
- He had a vertigo
Can I see the x-ray?
- Of course
See, it's nothing
I knew something would happen.
It was too soon.
What can I do, tie him up?
You don't even care
Calm down.
You can't admit that he's cured
And quit smoking, it makes you nervous You don't smoke in hospitals
You don't know what you're looking at
- You drive me crazy, both of you
I have two spoiled kids on my hands I'm sick of being the adult
I'm sick of you bullshit
Don't be vulgar
- I thought you liked vulgarity
Don't start
- Sure, I'll start. it's all you fault
I thought you'd change
No.
You thought you'd change me and you didn't.
You'll never change me
I can't do it anymore
That's not the exit the exit is on that side
Come on let's forget about it
I apologize if you want
I'd forgive you but what does it change?
It's five.
I have to stop by the store
I'll come for dinner tonight
If you want
Is it serious
No.
False alarm
It's in the head, all of it
I'd like to see him
Is it a face?
Looks like a monster
It was your portrait
It's strange, people never recognize themselves.
Here
I need 500.
I left quickly I forgot my money
I don't have them
What for?
- I'm going out
You should go home
- No tonight I'm having fun
I'm not made to be a monk
You're not going to the Mexico with that scum
Don't insult my friends
The hell I won't
Go ahead
They're pathetic.
Jerks.
Bastards
Is that so?
I'm a jerk and a bastard too
That's not true
You'll never be like them Why do you try so hard?
I don't know.
Maybe because of you
You're the one who thought me to love scum
The only difference is I don't sleep with them
I didn't want to cross you I'm worse than you
I've done awful things
Unforgivable things
Stephane
I wanted to tell you
That before I met you I hated men, all men
I thought they only existed to harm me, to mark me like cattle
I come from far And I have little time
I'll find my brother and we'll go back I won't see you again
But when you fell in the theater
Your eyes were wide open
I kissed you
You don't know who I am
I didn't know you knew Said
It's a shame all of this, a real shame
We're full
Ah it's you.
Said's not here And he hasn't paid his rent
I'll take care of it
Is the kid here?
His sister, she's come to fetch him
Let her take him, and keep him out
I told Said this morning this isn't daycare
You're writing to me?
To say what?
You want to give me something?
What do you want to do?
No it's yours
I think he wants us to go
This heat.
You think water's drinkable?
You want me to go?
Disgusting
He wanted to be free that's why he left
Free, what does that mean?
He can't speak or hear, what can he do?
He wanted to be far from you that's all
He needs to be protected
- From what, from life?
I don't know, from harm
He wanted to come here
What are you gonna do force him back?
With handcuffs?
- I have to do something
What are these?
Said's country.
He's never been, was born in France, has no family there
But he calls it his
I don't care about Said
This will be my room.
I'll rent him an other one, wherever he wants
I'll wait for you downstairs
I wasted a lot of your time Here, I give this back
You don't need me anymore?
- No thanks for everything
Wait
I have something else to tell you
It's about Stephane
I've never been a good father, I don't like them
But I have a son.
It's hard to believe but he's there
He's shut down
I'm disgusting, that's all he can say It's like he wants to be hated like others want to be loved
I'm sorry to say all this but when I saw you together
Mam, are you sure it's full?
Of course it is, I refuse people everyday, they have nowhere to sleep 2000 homeless, it's in the paper
They're looking for a place, not for life, but for one night
So they hover around
I used to have pity but since I lost my husband enough with emotions
Good thing I have a dog, with him I risk nothing
He sees everything, hears everything.
He never sleeps
Dogs are stronger than men
They're safer
- Here.
I pay in advance
We'll work it out
Are you sure you won't regret it?
- No I want to change
I thought you'd be in a wheelchair with pipes and a piss bag
When I called your mother she started bitching and hung up
We'll celebrate your return
Can you drink?
- I can do everything
I haven't done anything yet It's about time I start
How are the others?
It's quiet right now, we stay put
We keep on training
You have a new bouncer Bertrand's gone
Bertrand's back on duty.
He's in Beyrouth
I want to travel around too
Can you take care of it
If you want to leave, it's easy But you could do more with us
Everything's ready Just say one word
What word?
I don't understand
A name.
Of the guy who stabbed you.
Knifes don't fall on their own
I didn't see him.
I saw no one
It could have fallen on Bertrand We need to know
Stop it Frankie.
I didn't see him
What are you doing here?
Let's have a drink
You were prettier before What happened?
It's a massacre
I feel better this way.
Its like I was someone else.
It's more fun
I don't like people drinking from my glass
What do you want?
You don't understand
I don't understand
I want to know, at the theater why you shouted and fell
Everyone wants to know
But I want to forget, you understand?
Forget, that's all
Before summer dies
Before winter comes
Take me
I am like air quivering on a hot day
I want to become light
I want to become hue
Take me
Yes, take all of me
Before night comes
Take me between earth and sky between here and forgetting
Before summer dies
Before winter comes
Take me
Leaving already?
I've seen enough
- I'll wait outside
Come tomorrow, everyone will be there for training
Still doing that bullshit?
You've drunk too much Tomorrow, we need to talk
When your head is clear
I don't have to talk to you.
Fuck you
I like coming here.
Between earth and sky, lights up and down
Which ones do you prefer?
These ones I've seen
If I was home, they would be just like that.
Far away
I used to hide, refuse everything.
I locked myself up, thought I was strong
But really, I was afraid of everything
I like this city.
I don't want to leave
I loved it to.
I wanted to change it and protect it
It's bullshit
Now it's over
I can't live here
Leaving won't help
I'm sure you can live here, even be happy
As happy as I am now
Is that why you're trembling?
- Yes
Come
Where are we?
My mom's store.
She was supposed to open it last winter
But when spring came, it became the next.
She'll never open it
What kind of store?
Antiques at first, then clothing
Now I think it's a flower shop
Stop.
- Why not?
It gives me goose bumps
If I put my hands, like this
Stop
I don't want to force you
I want to, we have to
Only if you want it otherwise we don't have to
Of course I want it
If you prefer we can go to your place
At the convenient hotel?
- Convenient Hotel?
That's what it's called
Let's stay here
Close your eyes, don't look at me
Come
We meet here tomorrow?
- No at the store.
Now it's our place
Where's your hair?
You look like a jail bird
I waited to say goodbye
Fine, get out of here.
That's the best thing that could happen
Let me go through
I'm leaving with your brother
I wanted to say that too, otherwise we'd be gone
I'd take you too, but I can't
You can't do that
Leave him and I'll do what you want
It's hard to sleep with this heat
But your brother nothing can wake him up
I wish I was like him no talking, no hearing
If I had money I would give it to you But I used it all, I have nothing left
You have no right to take him
I know what I have to do
Don't stay there
Give that to your fiance It'll bring back memories
It was my first crime, I screwed up
Why?
Why did you do that?
Because he did something else
What did he do?
You really want to know?
- I'm not sure
Then go to bed.
It's better
Get out of here
You can sleep tight I'm leaving by myself
Dear Alain, I cannot take you with me
I need to know everything
What do I care?
Ask Stephane
I won't tell you anything
You're like your brother Following me around like a dog
I like animals because they don't talk
You're wrong to force me
- I don't care
Are you sure?
- Yes
Then I'll show you something
Saleo.
Saleo come here
Don't be afraid, it's me Said
Calm down.
Come.
I don't want to go there
- She won't take you away
Look.
Look what they did to him That's the work your fiance
Tell us how it happened
I can't Said
I've never asked you anything.
You owe me
I didn't see anything.
I was asleep Said gave the alarm
We woke up.
Fire everywhere.
We coughed
We shouted, bumped around, we couldn't see anything, the floor gave
That's when I saw the fire
Said saved my life.
You weren't sleeping, you saw them start the fire
You told me, they were masked They'll be back
That's enough, please.
You came, you'll listen to the end
- Let me go
Don't leave
I shouldn't have asked you
- It's not you fault
I'm leaving.
Forgive me
No, I don't want to be alone
Go home, it will be day soon
My home is far.
I'll never go back
Did anyone die?
No, what happened was nothing
Everyone forgot, life goes on
Until it starts again
I like this place.
Only beach and sand
It's as if men didn't exist
It feels good
Is it true they were masked?
All of them but one, your fiance
He saw me, we looked at each other
Then he went back they poured the gasoline
That's all.
That' why I wanted to kill him
I swore I would never tell anyone
Said.
You can't do that There's another plane at seven
What are you doing here?
- The landlady, she told me you left
Don't worry, I paid it
What does this faggot want?
Leave me alone, won't you.
Can I help you sir?
- Shut up, you
Look at this pimp playing hard to get You can keep your goddamn dick
Where you're going they don't want us
You see, it's the first time I touch you.
And the last
When you have your address, send it to me.
I'll come
Don't move your hand I'm coming with you
You remember when your son was dying
You said the one who did this, I'll kill him
I'm the one who did it
You can come with me now if you want
If you're looking for your brother He's at the beach like always
I don't know what I'm looking for
I shouldn't have come to this city And do what I did
I love no one.
It's over
I can't stand people who cry
And today, I don't have a handkerchief
Before I never cried
I'm just tired
Come.
Come sit down
You ever wanted to die?
I died many times, like everyone
We die and come back to life That's the way it goes
Wanting to die and never come back?
Whether we want it or not, we always come back.
It's like music
Damn it.
Rehersal Oh well, let them wait those loosers
The photos are gone
You have something to do too
Your brother.
I'll drop you at the beach
Stephane and Said, how long have they known each other?
More than two years I met Said by accident
Since then, he hates him, hates Arabs And he's not alone, he made friends
Before that he never went out was first everywhere
Then overnight, no more parents, or school
Hatred
Just hatred
Animals are lucky.
They don't have to dress back up
Hey I watched the door for you
You don't loose sight, do you?
Here
Want some?
- No
Come
Not here
I want some more
Stop it
No more, Said
I don't want to be used for that anymore.
It's sucks
It's not me you think about
So what?
It doesn't keep me from getting a hard-on, quite the opposite
If you want, we spend the night together the whole night, but not this
I'd say yes and not come, you know it alright then
I'll make a call
Hello?
Yes.
One moment
Stephane.
It's for you.
Phone call
Hello
Stephane, It's me
I met your girl, we live in the same hotel.
Small world, isn't it?
We spent the night together And I told her all about you
Someone had to, so I let the cat out
She knows what you did
You had a date I think?
I doubt if...
Stephane what's happening?
It's nothing.
You swam for too long.
And the sun...
Don't touch me
God I'm cold
It'll pass.
Don't worry
Don't touch me I tell you.
Leave me
Hi I would like the number of the Convenient Hotel
No, I don't know the address
Of course it exists
Hey Stephane, what's up?
Where's Frankie?
- He's up there
Hey Stephane
Look what the gunshots scared off What should I do with it?
Kill it
- But it's not dangerous
You come to apologize for yesterday?
- That's not why I'm here
Be careful Stephane.
I'm tired of your mood swings.
I don't like moods
I have to tell you
When we did the job last year at the hotel
Before torching the place there was a guy who saw me
He saw me, just me
So?
He's the guy who tried to kill me
Why didn't you tell me
- Because I thought he was right
Right to kill you?
Right to kill us all
You have to tell me everything you know
Nourredine
Tell me, Jeanne, Maite's sister and the boy
They're not at the hotel or your place.
Where are they?
I want to see them
I don't know where they are, and don't want to know
Your are like Iblis, the devil You think you are fire but you are clay
That's why you are cursed
Hi.
Are you the coast guard?
- Yes
You have to look for my brother.
I found these.
Isn't he swimming?
No I found a letter and he's not coming back
He's trying to reach someone
He'll try to cross the sea and he'll drown
We have to find him
Don't worry, I'll call the other gards and go look for him myself
Dear Alain, I can't take you with me but I know you'll manage
I taught you things, I hope you'll know how to fight and not be cheated
When you read this letter I'll be across the sea
I'll think of you.
Your brother Said
Ladies and Gentlemen, we are close
What we need now is to forget
Everything you know by heart, all the details
I don't dare ask you to close your eyes and yet...
What is this piece?
I know it's hot and we're doing overtime but I want an answer
What is this piece about?
Which feeling?
There's only one
The feeling is youth
And what is youth?
Youth is a blank page the risk of filling it in
Filling it and making a mistake
Youth is refusing to carry an old man inside
It's more than five Mr. Klotz I'm sorry but I have to go
Did they play well today?
They were tired, but then there was a rise
We had both at the same time
Fatigue and its opposite enthusiasm
Let's go eat, then
- You're crazy, it's too early
What are we gonna do?
I don't know
You're crazy to bring him here It's far.
It will cost a fortune
How do you know this place?
He almost died, you understand
He wanted to go to Said, so he swam
I'm not surprised, we can't keep him It's a good lesson
You disgust me.
Get out
Who do you think you are?
Are you crazy?
You're stupid.
Alain's right
Right to do what, drown?
Piss people off?
He's right to love Said and want to find him
You don't even know Said
I do.
I spent the night with him
And with another, worse than him And I love them both
Whatever they did or do, no one will stop me from loving them
Don't worry about me, I'm happy
- Come home with me, you need to rest
No, I'll stay here and wait for Alain.
They're doing x-rays
Go.
Go I tell you
He's on a drip.
Don't worry, everything's ok
When can he come out?
- Tomorrow morning
Can I stay here?
- If you want, but let him rest
I don't want to stay here
I'll get you out tomorrow
Tomorrow?
- Yes
Hello.
It's for you
It rang all morning.
I stopped answering.
This isn't a post office, you know
Hello
If you can help me out a little, I have to go see my husband
Look what I bought
If you could look after the hotel just for an hour
There's no one you'll have nothing to do
Because on Sundays he comes back late
And if someone wants a room?
You say it's full
Here, look.
It's him
In Philippeville.
We kept arguing
Even now, you know.
I have to go, he's waiting
Said
I was looking for you, at the hotel.
You can't go there
Why wouldn't I?
Ah yes, Jeanne.
That's right, I'm going to see her And you can't stop me
It's a good thing she came between us this girl wouldn't you say
Wait
Don't go there.
You mustn't go
Stop, for Christ's sake.
Stop
Let her choose she's big enough Anyway, you have better chances
You're crippled, she likes that Whereas me, well
I waited.
It's better if we go in together like brothers
Come on.
Your father said we were alike
You mustn't go
I gave you up
You gave me up.
To your friends?
Come on, they must be there.
Go
- You did that?
Come on, hurry
No.
You're coming with me now.
You are
It's nothing.
It happened to me before.
It's nothing
After that it'll be dark.
I know
Then I'll open my eyes.
I know
It happened to me before
No.
I don't want it to start again
See?
I'm standing
What is he looking at?
Creon...
After death, enemies don't become friends Antigone.
- I unite to love not to hate
Delta One, we're picking up a transmission.
Something's going down.
Keep your eyes open.
Jesus Christ.
It's a hit.
Patch me to the dispatch now.
All units move in.
Repeat.
All units move in.
In a bizarre twist of circumstance, three members of a terrorist group, whose identity is still unknown, were killed while trying to plant a bomb onto the stage at the sport stadium.
The bomb was apparently meant for Senator Hanson.
And believed to be set to go off at the precise moment Senator Hanson was to speak at a special rally on terrorism.
Senator Hanson's only response was.
This must be the work of maniacs.
Come on.
Get up asshole.
Get up.
Grow up Henry.
We just got here.
But the guy took a shot at me.
Henry and terrorist do have a way of spoiling everything, don't they
I can't believe they're trying to kill your father Christy.
Come on guys.
Can't we talk about something else Let's have fun.
I've got it. i propose a toast to the best rider this side of Texas.
Besides Steve.
Well, thanks for remembering me.
Steve I've got a question.
How does your brother feel about you always taking out his future old lady
Say baby, why don't you take me out of this, ...den of degradation.
Take me to the Kasbah.
Would the dance floor do
That'll do.
I don't mind if I do.
Guys, let's show them how we do things around here.
Get in.
Put it away Pocahontas.
Anything you say Tonto.
Well
What
Well how'd it go
I was awful.
Really
Miss Michele, please see Dino at the life cycles area.
Miss Michele, please.
You were probably just nervous.
I am nervous.
The whole thing is ridiculous.
I wish I could call it off.
You're too good a rider.
You're not going to stop now.
Who's talking about riding
I thought you were talking about the competition.
Screw the competition.
I'm talking about tomorrow.
It's an engagement party.
Not a funeral.
You're hopeless.
I mean, I don't understand you.
He's rich, he's good looking... and he's a Worthington.
That's almost royal blood.
Then why don't you marry him
Why, he never asked me.
And besides I'm not Senator Hanson's daughter.
I tried to warn him.
No.
No.
He does it anyway.
Three weeks later, to the day, wouldn't you know it
They moved the God damned highway.
- Excuse me.
Bob
- Hey Steve.
Steve.
I'll be with you in just one minute.
Just give me one minute.
Now, if you think that was something, ...just let me tell you about the Peterson case.
I'm sorry.
I know I'm being really rude...
- and everything.
- Nonsense.
Nonsense, little brother.
Today the word rudeness doesn't even exist.
Pardon me gentlemen while I go speak with my baby brother.
What the hell is the matter with you Steve
Do you have any idea who I was just speaking with
No.
Who were just speaking with
That's congress, Never mind.
Can we talk
You look awful.
How much have you had to drink
- Not that much.
- Steve.
Steve.
I know that this is difficult for you, socializing with all the dignitaries.
But it's something that you're going to have get used to.
The Worthington's and the Hansons.
Still a little hard to believe, isn't it kiddo
Yeah.
That's what I wanted to speak to you there about, Bob--
Hey, Just take it easy.
Relax.
Everything's going to be okay.
Jesus Christ.
What the hell have you been doing
Rolling around in the barn or something
I just can't believe you tried to keep it from me.
Just don't tell me you're in love with him.
Oh, come on.
It's your fiancée's younger brother.
Do you know what a field day the press will have
He makes me happy.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
This is ridiculous.
Of course I'm going to marry Bob.
Hey.
Thanks for understanding.
So what about you
When are you going to be serious about someone
Hey!
Mack.
Get the police.
What are you going to do with me
We're going to-- and throw it in your fucking face.
So shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
No.
You know something baby
I'm going to make a whore out of you.
No.
I just don't accept it.
Hello.
Thank you.
Just a moment.
It's Congressman Reading.
Do you want to talk to him
Hello Bill.
Yeah.
I appreciate your call.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Yes.
Listen Bill.
I've got to get back to you.
It's been confirmed.
At eight 0 five pm, KCAD-TV received an audio tape from the San Filipe Anarchist Army.
Same group that tried to blow up our sports stadium.
In return for Christy's life they demand two and a half million dollars in cash... and a prepared statement condemning American involvement in Central America read on national TV.
We have seventy two hours to respond fourteen days to meet their demands.
Anybody got any coffee It's going to be a long night.
Oh, God.
- Excuse me, Mister Buchannon
- Yes
I'm Bob Worthington.
- Pleased to meet you Mister--
- Christy's fiancée.
I, I know how delicate these things can be.
But strictly off the record, what are the chances of actually getting Christy out alive
Why don't you watch the eleven o'clock news.
Your guess is as good as mine.
Hey.
Can I get a cup of coffee
No.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You're missing the point.
My client nearly lost his entire hand using that food processor.
And he just doesn't see it your way.
And quite frankly, neither will the judge.
- I have to talk to you.
- Hey.
You can't just...
What the hell is going on
Mister Goldfarb
I'm going to have to get back to you.
What the hell are you talking about
It's been three days.
Lower your voice.
It's been three damn days and no one's done a thing.
Can we move this into one of the conference rooms
Hey look.
I'll just talk to you later.
No Mike.
Will you stay here and handle the Collins case
There's nothing we can do.
Bullshit.
What
Have her father send in a goddamned hit squad.
It's done all the time.
Not in Central America.
Not during an election year.
Well then hire a group of mercenaries.
I'm sure you can afford it.
You're out of your mind.
What's gotten into you You're being ridiculous.
No.
You're being ridiculous.
You're just going to sit there and let them kill your fiancé.
Why the hell are you so interested in this all of a sudden
Since when is it any of your goddamned business
You want to know why it's my business
Do you really want to know why it's my business
Yeah.
Yeah.
I've been trying to tell you this for the last six months.
But you're got your head stuck so far up your ass you don't listen.
And still no official government response to the terrorist demands in the Christy Hanson kidnapping case.
Thanks so much Bill.
And when we return, a complete profile of Miss Hanson, ...including some exclusive footage of her winning the equestrian ...semifinals of the twenty fourth international games.
How can you just sit there while this is happening
For Christ sake, you're a senator.
You can arrange to have their demands met.
You have it within your power.
You don't understand.
We don't negotiate with terrorists.
I was the one who introduced the goddamned legislation into the Senate.
This isn't a goddamned press conference.
Do you have any idea what this would make me look like if I gave in now
I can't revers my position.
Everything we've stood for would become a farce.
To hell with politics.
She's your daughter.
I can't.
I can't bend the law to anyone's benefit.
Goddammit.
Not even my own.
Then call him.
There are things he can do.
He listens to you.
He has a daughter.
He'll understand.
Call him.
My poor Joanna.
I did.
I already did.
There's nothing we can do.
Not a goddamned thing.
What are you doing
Are you out of your mind
Nobody's asking you to come.
I don't believe you.
You ought to be committed.
You know that.
Look.
I'm not asking you to come.
Okay
Why don't you just get out of here.
I'll be fine.
You're really serious.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm really serious.
Okay
So what the hell are you waiting around for
Maybe I'm waiting for you ask me to come.
N-O.
Spells no.
I am not going.
Look Eddie.
This is a the chance of a lifetime.
We could even make soldier of war magazine.
Eddie Christy is our friend.
Don't you think we owe her that much
Fine.
She's our friend.
But let the government deal with that.
They can't.
Their hands are tied.
You guys are nuts.
Are you coming Or not
Yes.
But guys.
I do have on question.
What are we going to use for firepower
Nice shooting Tag.
All right Henry.
Now it's your turn.
Let's go fire a real man's gun.
All right.
Load me up.
Do you want me to pat you on the head too
Yeah.
- All right.
Come on all ready.
- Shoot it.
Geez.
You think you used enough dynamite there Butch
Now gentlemen, I would like to show you my little contribution ...to this little groove thing that we've got going here.
It you'll step this way please.
Don da da da don.
Da da da don.
da da da da da da da don.
Da da don.
Inflate-a-mate.
Your handy dandy survival kit.
Why take that when you can take the real thing
Oh, boy.
Are you boys finished playing with yourselves
Carla, can't you ever find something nice to say
What are you doing here Carla
Look, I know what you guys are doing.
Everybody does.
Henry's been shooting his mouth off over town.
How'd you know we were here
It's not hard.
You guys are making enough noise.
When do we leave
No way.
Forget it.
Listen.
Christy is my best friend and I have the right to go.
And besides--
What
So what the hell's that supposed to mean
I don't know.
She said it.
I don't speak Jewish.
Were you guys planning to hire an interpreter or just teach the entire population English
Well now, that's real funny.
It's about as funny as five college students going down... to Central America and getting their butts shot off.
There's only four of us.
There's five.
I'm getting a bad felling about this.
Are you sure this is the right way
Well, it's on the map.
I'm going to kill him.
I'm going to wring his filthy little neck.
Doesn't he realize what this makes me look like
I have to go down there, god dammit.
I have to.
You're talking crazy.
Will you calm down.
Do you want a valium
Not only is the little shit screwing my fiancé behind my back but now, now he has to go and make me look like some goddamn chicken shit coward.
I'm going down there goddammit.
And do what
What can you possibly accomplish by going down into that rat hole
What is this
We found him in the cellar of the church.
He says he's a priest.
I think he's a government spy.
I am a priest too now.
Huh
We don't kill priests.
In mid-step a might roar and concussion swept us off our feet.
I looked up and to my horror I saw a foot, a hand, ...a finger, and part of a torso.
I looked at my arms and they were full of blood and goo.
I didn't feel hit, just stunned, with the wind knocked out of me.
Now I could hear the cries and screams of the survivors.
Isn't this great
You know being out here makes me feel like I'm part of it.
The horror.
Henry.
This commando garbage is really going to your head.
Yo, Why you read that junk, man
They could be out there right now.
Thousand eyes glaring and staring, just waiting for us.
Henry.
We couldn't be any safer.
Hey Henry Knock it off.
Okay
Henry.
Close the magazine.
Put it away.
Let's go to sleep.
Okay
Go ahead.
Go to sleep.
That's just what they want.
Knock it off.
Okay psycho
Does anybody have the slightest idea where we are
You're the one with the map.
How're you doing dude
Maybe we should call the fire department.
So how do you say five cold beers in Spanish
How the hell should I know.
I thought you said you knew how to speak Spanish.
I thought you and Christy were just friends.
What's that supposed to mean
I guess we're both liars.
Notice anything strange about this place
What do you mean
Like we're the only Americans here.
That's real perceptive of you Mack.
Guys
I'm getting a real bad feeling about this.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Come on you guys.
Let's get out of here.
Hey!
Amigos!
I wish to have a word with you.
What's your hurry
You got an appointment
Or maybe you just don't like our company.
What is it I can't hear you.
Aren't there any police around here
You want the police
You're looking at him.
Amigos
That's a very fancy jeep you're got there.
You think maybe you could loan it to me
You looking for trouble fat man
What's it to you gringo
You're too fucking close to my machine.
Now if you want to slit their throat you do it somewhere else.
You've got a big mouth blue eyes.
In this town we fuck with whatever we want.
No this time.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Don't worry.
I'll take care of them.
Henry.
Come back here.
Henry!
Don't do this.
Henry!
That will kill those spick bandits.
You know I could hardly keep me sights on it that damn jeep was bouncing so hard.
I should have never have come.
Then I almost squeezed off a shot.
Good thing I didn't though because the jeep hit a bump and threw my aim off.
Guys What are we doing down here
Then I put my sights on it.
Slowly squeezed the trigger and--
Stupid.
It's just plain stupid.
Hey, shut up Eddie.
Can't you hear I'm talking
You know.
I'm beginning to think you actually enjoyed doing what you did.
You know we killed people back there.
You little wimp.
Hey. what are you doing, man.
Come on you guys.
Henry.
Take it easy.
Hey!
Hey!
What the hell's the matter with you Henry
He's losing it.
That's what wrong with him.
Look.
We're not here to kill each other.
But if you want to, go ahead.
Now that's marvelous speech young lady, producing the desired result as well.
Who are you
What are you punks doing down here off the main boulevard so to speak
That's our business.
What you did back there is everybody's business.
Besides, you've got a lot of bad people looking for you.
We'll go to my place in the morning.
Name's Bishop.
Hey, Bishop.
Why all the bones
Keeps the night far away.
You know, I've got a bad feeling about all this.
Yeah.
So do I.
All right.
We'll spend a few days here till things quiet down.
Thank for the invitation.
But we can't.
Oh, yeah.
Why not
Because we're looking for our friend, who was kidnapped by terrorists.
You're talking about that Senator Hanson's daughter.
Right
How do you know that
There's been plenty of government effort to get her out down here.
And personally, I don't think they stand a chance.
Well that's why we're here, to get her out.
The man you're looking for, his name is.
Estoban.
And you have an appointment with death.
Do you really think you're going to be able to pull this thing off
Why You don't think so
Let me tell you about this guy Estoban and his boys.
December of nineteen eighty three there was this United States ambassador to San Felipe, just before the uprising.
He was a real good family man.
Went to church every Sunday.
He was a good friend of General Fuentes.
But most of all he wanted to stop the spread of communism in Central America.
One Sunday on the way home from church there was terrible accident.
Car ran into a bus.
He pulled his limousine over with his body guards to see if he could help out.
Car opened fire on them, killing all the bodyguards and half the people on the bus.
The terrorists grabbed him and dragged him back to their camp.
They tortured him for over a week before they finally killed him.
But what you probably didn't read in the newspapers, ...is that they castrated him while he was still alive.
And then they cut this head off.
And used it in a game of soccer.
Where do you fit into all this
You want to survive down here, there's one thing you've got to learn.
Don't ask too many questions.
So what do you think
Well.
This is just terrific if you're preparing for World War Two.
This is the eighties.
Come here.
Let me show you something.
Look.
Why don't you guys just give this thing up and go home
We've come too far for that--
You know these rebels can mean business.
- I can't help it.
I love her.
- Yeah.
And what do the others think about this
I guess they feel the same way I do or they wouldn't be here.
Suit yourself.
It's your asses, not mine.
Here.
This is what you need.
I guess so.
That should do it.
All right.
Now when you're ready to mount this turkey... you just take her right here.
Now you see here
- Yeah.
- This money
It should sit right in there like that...
And you're ready with this.
When you finish, you just remove the mount.
As simple as that.
Go away.
Leave me alone.
Take it.
It's good.
No.
Your people are bad.
I'm not bad.
No.
It's good.
See
Here.
I have something else for you.
Thank you.
Listen.
If your father does as Estabon says, you will be free.
So, so take it easy.
Okay
Okay
Thank you very much.
Thanks.
What do you think,--
I agree.
A bunch of rank amateurs.
Huh
Nothing can stop us now guys.
That's it.
The radiator is shot.
Can you fix it Eddie
We can go another two, maybe three miles, then I'm going to need some parts.
Dammit Eddie, can't you just fix it
Fix it You want me to fix it
Then why don't you find me an auto parts store.
Come on you guys.
Knock it off.
That's not going to get us anywhere.
Well what are we going to do now
Bunch of amateurs.
Me and Ping figured you could use some help.
What do they think I am, Handyman Jack
Why don't you throw this over you.
Keep the chill off.
Thank you.
You're worried about your friend, aren't you
Yes, I am.
You know, the government told us there... was nothing that they could do about her.
I don't believe that.
So we had to come down here.
We at least have to try.
Well, I admire your courage.
There are no limits when you love someone.
But it's not going to be easy getting her out.
I can tell you right now.
Ever handled firearms
Little bit.
I fired at the Beverly Hills gun club.
That's terrific.
Well, this is no video game honey.
You know the other side shoots back.
So you stay real close to me, hear
Thank you for helping us.
It's not them I'm helping.
It's you.
Son of a bitch.
Estoban.
From here on out stay close.
Thank you.
Do you know, I speak English.
I was in a circus.
I have even been to EI Norte.
Help me.
Please.
They will kill me.
I know they mean to kill me.
Help me.
If I help you, will you promise to help me...
Yes.
My father will help you.
Please.
Dance Eddie!
Why do you play the flute
The flute well let's say it's a complete contradiction--.
Every time I break it out I confuse the hell out of people.
Beside it's an international language.
Everybody understands it.
Whether you're from Brooklyn, New York or Peking, China.
And to me I guess,
I guess music is a kind of prayer.
That's very beautiful.
Want some food
I don't know how you can eat after seeing those bodies.
Well I'm used to it.
Got transferred down here from Nam in seventy five after the fall of Saigon.
You never went home
No.
I didn't want to.
Get down.
Let's get to the guns.
I owe you one kid.
Yeah.
You do.
God.
Bishop's been gone a long time.
I wonder what he's going with that guy... we picked up in the marketplace.
Well, he talked.
Now I know where to find Estoban.
What the hell did you do to that guy
A little something I picked up from the Viet Cong.
All right.
We're going to camp here for two days.
Now get some rest.
You're going to need it.
Then you and me, we're going on a little scouting expedition in the morning.
Hey.
Slowdown will you This mud is deep
I thought you wanted to get her back alive.
What's going on
I'll be a son of a bitch.
That's where they keep their chopper.
Come on man.
What the hell is going on down there
You see that fat fuck in the back of the Lincoln
- Yeah.
- That's Estoban.
What the hell is he doing
Remember the bedtime story I told you about the ambassador
That's his limo.
So where the hell is Christy
I guess we find that out tomorrow.
You miss her, huh
She's lucky to have you.
Not so lucky now.
You saw the camp.
What was it like
Do we have a chance
I don't know Carla.
I know we're doing what's right.
But I'm afraid we're all going to die.
I can't believe I let you guys talk me into coming down here.
You wanted to come down here just as bad as I did.
Yeah.
But Henry, I'm scared.
You're not.
I'm scared.
You think I'm made out of steel
It's okay.
You're all right man.
As soon as we're back,
I'm going to take you out for a night on the town.
Okay
Hey Steve Come on out here.
All right.
Everybody listen up.
Let's go through this one more time.
Now I suggest that we go up on the right hand side of the camp.
There's a tower over here that's going to have to be taken out.
Mack, you stay out on the perimeter.
You're going to cover us.
- You understand
- You got it.
All right.
Now once we have your friend out of there, everybody's got to make their way back to the river.
Once at the river, head north.
Somewhere up this river Estoban has got a helicopter stashed.
By the way you bring some clam down here
Yeah.
Hey Bishop.
Just a thought.
If we were to hit it from the other end, we'd have the sun at our backs.
And they wouldn't even see us.
And we could hit them before they knew it.
You know if you stay at this long enough you're going to be as good as me.
I suggest we all get some sleep.
It's going to be a busy day.
I will help you.
Stop her!
Men she's escaping.
Stop her!
You see what happens when you start trouble
Come on.
Let's hit them.
Don't freak out on me now.
Get her out of that cage.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Mack!
Mack!
Oh, God!
Carla, Get up!
I'll meet you at the chopper.
If I can get you to that chopper... do you think you could fly it the hell out of here
Well do you
I think so.
Here.
You've got to hold onto that.
Come on.
Well you're on your own now hot shot.
You've got one hell of an expensive date in there.
You take good care of her.
You know what For the first time
I've got a really good feeling about things.
I just want you to see yourself die you fat fuck.
You lose gringo.
- Christy!
- Steve!
Eddie.
Eddie.
What about Carla
I don't think she made it.
Let's go.
Oh, my God.
- What
- I can't fly.
What
I can't fly a goddamned helicopter.
Well, what are we going to do
Bunch of amateurs.
Go on get in the back.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's go.
Hey!
Let's go, Carla.
All right boys and girls.
Let's get the hell out of here.
HAMLET GOES BUSINESS
Not here, Klaus.
He might hear.
Alright, Gertrude.
Later.
Good night, darling.
Come to bed soon.
Ham...
let me!
Father!
Asleep.
Tired, poor man.
What will now happen to the Group?
Hamlet inherits 51% of the shares.
The rest belong to the bank, insurance companies - certain foundations and to Klaus.
He's been buying them ever since the bank made him a director.
He'll probably be the new President.
But that needs Hamlet's consent.
The brat doesn't know he's one of the most powerful men in the land.
Luckily he's too stupid to use his powers.
They'll give him enough pocket money to keep him happy - and make him marry a daughter of some good family.
I want to show you something.
SATAN AND JESUS ON THE MOUNTAIN
TWO MONTHS LATER
You know I can't...
Not before marriage.
That's blackmail... darling.
I don't want it to be so banal.
- Is that the only reason?
We'd both regret it afterwards.
That's what you think.
What did you say?
Leave me now.
I promised to dine with my mother.
Are you cold?
A bit...
But the night is so beautiful.
Can you see the North Star there between the clouds?
Yeah.
Want to kiss again?
Hamlet...
What I am going to say now is not just a whim.
You'll understand that if you want to.
I loved your father as much as - you can demand a good wife to love a tyrant -
who never returns your love, giving you as much passion - as he gives to a set of winter tires.
Don't tarnish my father's memory.
I've been silent too long to gloss over the facts.
Then get to the point.
I'm going to marry Klaus.
I love him.
If you do that...
If you do that, I shall disown you.
Take that away.
Construction of the new Head Office must begin immediately.
Show Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in.
Take the evening plane to Oslo, book into the Sheraton - and meet Wallenberg in the morning.
Give this to him personally, then wait.
Bring his answer to me unopened.
Any questions?
- No, sir.
If somebody asks for the purpose of your journey - you're going there to relax and have fun.
Norway?
- You may go.
What are you planning?
Wallenberg will buy our unprofitable sawmill - and most of our useless mines in the North.
But only if we close down our shipyard - so he gets Scandinavian monopoly on Caribbean Sea Cruisers.
Why the sawmill?
- He runs it for a few years - increases the insurance - then burns it down.
- I see.
Will we get enough profit?
There's one condition.
Wallenberg will sell to us, for a token sum - the majority in the Swedish rubber duck industry.
That'll be our main line of business from now on.
Sounds good but there's a problem.
Closing the shipyard may cause protests and demonstration.
We'll pull the curtains down.
Hunger and cold'll soon drive them home.
I'll put the deal to the board.
- Hamlet's a director, too.
So far he's been happy to play with his crayons - waiting for the meeting to end so he can chase your pretty daughter.
He's harmless.
The Japanese will soon market cheap wood made of plastic.
What gives me the honour?
We saw your father last night.
Poor father, you don't look too good.
Don't insult me but listen carefully.
I'm your father's spirit.
It's so hot in Hell where I was sent to for my sins - that I've got to sneak out sometimes to cool down a bit.
Although I don't think much of you -
I believe you loved your father enough to revenge his murder.
Murder?
- Exactly, stupid.
The inquest was a total farce.
Get on with it, it's cold and I don't want to be late for dinner.
You seem eager.
It'll soon be morning and I must return to Hell.
But before I do I'll tell you what you must do.
A TERRIBLE QUARREL
You wanted to talk to me.
You have two minutes.
I've got two things.
What's that?
Bad grammar.
You say: "I want to discuss two matters with you."
Or: "There are two matters I want to discourse with you presently."
One is that...
First of all a want a new office.
Now you must enter through the closet - and customers don't like that.
There's no phone.
I've got to use the guard's phone.
But if thing's don't get done I get the blame.
I'll take care of it myself.
Anything else?
Lay off my sister.
Ophelia's a good girl, she's not for you.
She needs a gentle and caring husband - and we all know you and what you want from her.
Bastard!
You don't give me orders!
As for Ophelia, I'll do what I want.
And you I don't even like - so get lost!
The closet's your new office.
I want to see the President.
I've been insulted.
A moment, please.
Lauri Polonius is here.
Everything I've done for this company is meaningless.
I get no respect as a person or an employee.
What hurts me most is that my childhood friend Hamlet - who played with me in warehouses - until we both got more and more responsibility in the Group - treats me with open hostility.
He's been telling openly behind my back - that when he's President I won't have anything to do here.
What did you say to him?
I got so depressed that I ran away.
Get to the point, son, don't babble like a small girl.
I want a year off to continue my studies in Stockholm.
Have a nice trip.
On her fair white bosom these roses...
Now I've got it.
Now you may doubt that the stars are made of fire - that the sun does move.
Truth is a liar, my darling, but my love is true.
Dearest Ophelia - my verses they limp -
rhymes won't fit my sighs.
But believe me - that I love you... the best.
Oh, better than the best.
Hamlet.
LAURI TRAVELS
My luggage is already on the ship.
Goodbye!
Goodbye, Lauri.
Don't work too much.
- I'll try to have fun, too.
Promise me one thing, sister.
- Whatever you ask.
If Hamlet tries to get you in bed - remember how much you may lose -
if you listen to him and open your heart or your legs - to that gigolo.
People will talk and you'll get a bad reputation.
I promise, Lauri.
Go now, the car's waiting.
- Goodness, I must hurry.
A few lines of advice first:
Buy as good clothes as you can afford, stylish, not gaudy.
Clothes make the man - and the Swedes have a most selective taste.
Never lend money, you'll just lose both your money and your friend.
If you ever borrow, don't pay back too soon.
The lender may die and you save a lot.
Farewell then, both of you.
Remember what I said, Ophelia.
What did he say?
Told me not to date Hamlet.
- What did you say?
I promised not to.
Lauri's a good boy, too good in fact.
I wish he'd be more like you.
It's difficult to believe you're twins.
He's got your mother's weak blood in him.
Soft people won't get anywhere these days.
What do you want me to do?
Continue your game with Hamlet.
His family's got too much money to be left to some typist.
It's so strange.
Sometimes I feel he really likes me.
The look in his eyes is almost human.
And it makes me so sad.
- He's just acting.
Nothing's certain until the priest says "amen".
Good thing we're Catholic, divorce would be expensive for him.
Here.
Buy yourself something pretty to wear for the next time you see him.
Thanks, father.
You may go.
Today's meeting may be interesting.
Pity you can't come.
That's what's wrong with you, the working class people.
You can't come to the nice places we upper class people go.
That's why I'm always so depressed.
- Are you joking?
Simo, by the way - after I've ended the meeting as I please, being a god -
you mustn't wonder if I start acting strange.
It's just a show I'm putting on for a certain purpose.
Why do you think your doings should interest me?
I just like driving the car.
And I love Helena.
But still I'd like to do something good - to be like the others:
a human being.
Do you know what I do first thing in the morning?
I don't care.
- I throw up.
That's how bad I feel.
Bring me the scales.
I want to see if I've lost weight since last spring.
Those of you who remember meetings here years, even decades ago - when decisions about new production lines - or new paper types or grenade casings were made -
may consider this rubber duck out of place - or even amusing.
But as I've said, the future of the group - and Finnish industry lies here.
We lost the weapons industry to Swedes a long time ago - and soon we can only raise our hands, watching helplessly - how the tiny Japanese steal the paper and the timber markets.
Wallenberg's offer is splendid, you all know that.
I hope you also know that this is our only chance.
We cannot afford to wait, to "pause for breath", as somebody suggested.
That makes you as good as dead in the international market.
Nobody deals with losers.
Giving up the shipyard and the sawmill is hard for many of you - but perhaps the doubled profits from the rubber duck industry - may help us forget.
We can't halt progress or alter history.
Therefore I ask for your consent for the deal.
We'll take a vote.
Those in favour?
I thank the board for your confidence and...
Just a moment, gentlemen.
Have you perhaps forgotten - that I own 51% of the shares?
My great great etc. grandfather founded this Group - in 1812, in early December.
That gives me 51% of the votes.
So my friends.
We won't close down a single shipyard or sell the sawmill.
Not to speak of playing with rubber ducks.
The deal with Wallenberg is off!
HAMLET BECOMES MELANCHOLIC
Repressed love is the main cause for his behaviour.
Ophelia has, on my bidding, refused his proposals.
Hamlet has become melancholic - he's fasting, can't sleep, he's become apathetic - confused and gradually lost his mind, and now he's raving.
His behaviour can't be described with any other word.
Hamlet has never loved anybody except himself.
In that he's like me.
- And me.
That's why I hate him so.
But there's something else.
Some other bank might be attempting a takeover.
We must get him to sign the deal or get rid of him.
An accident, perhaps.
- Too dangerous, in a police state.
And too hasty.
He's been walking around all day, reading.
I'll try to find out who's behind all this.
You can watch us on the TV in your room.
How are you, Hamlet?
- Alright, thank God.
Do you know me?
- Sure, you're the butcher.
Not I.
- I wish you were.
Why?
- It would make you more respectable.
Only one man in 10,000 is respectable - and even he's nothing much to boast about.
- That's true.
For if the sun breeds maggots in a dead bitch - it's worth the carrion to kiss it.
You got a daughter?
- Yes.
Don't let her take too much sun, for it's nobler to give.
Tell her about the facts of life - or she might burst pregnant.
You're talking about my daughter?
In my youth I, too, suffered much for love.
What are you reading?
- Words, words, words.
About what?
- About it.
What's in there?
- Gossip.
Even if it was true, it's disgusting to print it because - one day you'll be as old as I am, if you go backward like a crab.
I see.
I must go.
Will we meet again?
I can't promise you anything else with as much pleasure, butcher - except my life, except my life, except my life.
Mad!
See anything you'd fancy there?
No.
I want ice-cream.
One moment.
There you go.
This could be the night.
We could go to my place and...
You know the rest.
Can't you think of anything else?
No.
Not when I'm with you, baby.
If you really loved me your voice would be more tender.
So you won't do it?
No, darling.
Then I'm wasting my time for nothing.
Look who's here.
What a coincidence, my best friends.
Bartender!
We'll buy you a drink.
I don't want to drink, I'm too depressed.
That's what we wanted to talk about, we're your friends.
Tell us what's on your mind.
Lately, I don't know why -
I've lost my cheerful spirit.
I don't even enjoy sports.
I've changed so much - that this wonderful world looks like a barren reef.
Somehow I feel like puking all the time.
Evening, Mother dear.
Hello, Klaus.
I know I've been just impossible but I'd like to make it up - and invite you to the theatre with me.
A wonderful idea.
I'm so happy now that you're well again.
Speak the lines light and nice.
But if you shout them as many actors do -
I could as well take them to the market place.
Don't strut and wave our hands about too much - or stare into distance as if you had something to say.
Sir, I believe and I want to believe - that we've got rid of all that.
Well then, that's marvellous.
You acted too when you were younger, didn't you, Klaus?
Yes, in my university days.
I was considered talented.
I played Julius Caesar.
I was killed at the Capitol, Brutus killed me.
Brutal of him to kill such capital a pig there.
Sit properly, people are watching.
- I can't, Mother dear.
Ophelia's too strong a magnet.
I couldn't tear myself away from her even if I wanted to.
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
No.
Be quiet, the play begins.
Miss Gwendolyn.
Allow me to introduce myself...
You're funny.
Your only clown.
What can a man do but be funny?
Look, how cheerful my mother looks two hours after my father's death.
It's four months now.
So long?
Good God!
Died four months ago and not forgotten yet?
Sounds promising.
Then again a great man must build industrial halls - or he'll be forgotten like a wooden horse at Halloween.
His epitaph is:
Woe, woe, the wooden horse is forgotten.
Now it begins.
What is this?
Stop the play!
Why?
Don't you like it?
What about you, Mother?
Madam wants to see Master Hamlet.
- He's not here.
Mother dear, you look ill.
You've offended Klaus very much.
- The more, the better.
But can you insult a toilet seat and how much?
Why are you so cruel to me?
Because you shamed the memory of my father - by taking that eunuch's name.
Can't you forgive me?
- No, on the contrary.
Take a look at this.
Are you going to kill me?
- Are you crazy?
You'll have to do that yourself.
But as for Klaus...
What's that?
A rat?
Take this!
You, Polonius?
- What a massacre!
Almost as bad as to kill one's husband - and marry his messenger boy.
Kill one's husband?
- That's what I said.
Goodbye, you poor hasty man.
I mistook you for your boss.
Now you know that meddling can be dangerous.
See how this talkative fool is still, serious and grave.
I'll take the guts away, you'll sleep better without it.
Come, sir, to the end.
And Mother, from now on you will lock your door from Klaus.
For once in your life, try to stay firm.
BODY IN THE STREET LEADS TO INVESTIGATION
They will interrogate everyone.
Hamlet must leave for London.
We'll disguise it as a business trip.
You'll meet Murdoch, he owns a small mail order chain.
He'll take good care of you.
Ophelia, and at this hour!
I came to return your letters.
Leave them on my desk, I'll burn them later.
The passionate outbursts of youth...
Badly formulated sentences full of lies.
I want back the gifts I gave you.
Alright.
Now that we owe each other nothing, will we ever marry?
Will we ever be happy and grow old together?
No, poor girl, that won't happen.
Why not?
You're too thin.
- I could eat more.
It was just an excuse.
The truth is, I don't love you enough and I'm going to travel.
But when you return?
- I'm getting tired of this.
Stay away for a couple of months.
I'll let you know when things've cooled down.
Take this to Murdoch.
Some bills.
Have a nice trip.
The letter contains instructions to Murdoch.
We won't see Hamlet again.
Go and make sure of that.
It's so nice and quiet now, isn't it?
Although I miss Hamlet.
Do you?
Sure, darling.
He's such a sweet boy.
When he was a child he never cried.
He never slept either.
Just stood in the corner with a strange look in his eyes.
Really?
But he did a bad thing to poor Polonius.
He certainly did.
Did it hurt the company much?
Yes, he was a good manager, he'd been with us for a long time.
I feel sorry for Ophelia.
How will she manage now that Lauri's away, too?
You went away, leaving me here
With no reason to smile
I'm still waiting to hear from you
To hear the reason why
I'll do anything you ask
Soon we'll meet again And leave the past behind
My dreams won't come true
Until I return to you
In my heart I hear you calling
And I know what I've got to do
Upon the wings of the morning wind
I hurry back to you
I'll do anything you ask
Soon we'll meet again And leave the past behind
My dreams won't come true
Until I return to you
Just wait, we'll meet tonight
And everything will be alright
My dreams won't come true
Until I return to you
Until I return to you...
I rushed here as soon as I heard of my father's death.
For what?
To find the lifeless body of my sister Ophelia.
Woe is me.
I lost my mother when I was born, now I have nobody.
Poor little Ophelia.
I understand your grief.
What do you want me to do?
Tell me who's guilty, and I'll avenge!
It's Hamlet.
He killed your father and drove Ophelia to suicide.
I knew it...
Hamlet.
You won't get away with this.
Patience.
If you really want revenge - you must do it so you won't suffer yourself.
I'll help you.
Mother dear!
You came back home so soon.
Yes, I'm truly back now.
I can hardly wait to tell Klaus, he'll be so glad!
You think so?
How was the trip?
Was the Channel rough today?
Yes, it was really furious today.
But you haven't heard the bad news yet.
Little Ophelia is dead.
Drowned in her bath, poor thing.
A terrible accident.
A TRAGIC MISTAKE
We'll poison the leg only.
Hamlet's a glutton, he'll eat it first.
There'll be no evidence left and his death will seem - to have been caused by a bone stuck in the windpipe.
Your mother just died.
- What happened?
Why wasn't I told?
I didn't want to share her last moments with a bastard like you.
You'll pay for this.
Food poisoning, there was nothing I could've done.
I'm sorry.
I'm tired and fed up and as sad as you are.
The days of deliberation are over.
I don't care what happens.
All the others are gone.
We were hardly a golden couple, Gertrude and I - but during the best moments we shared a certain warmth.
We made a terrible mistake but Hamlet's to blame.
Tell the guard to close the doors and the windows, we'll get him.
Hamlet.
I'll come.
What is it?
I see.
But I'm not unarmed either.
Call the police.
A terrible thing has happened.
The President and Lauri Polonius have killed each other.
Simo.
- Yes.
I'm not that kind of girl.
- I know.
Couldn't we get married and have a real home?
That's what I want more than anything else - but it's not possible, not yet.
The union has ordered me to keep an eye on Hamlet.
Our love must be sacrificed for the shipyard, if necessary.
You called.
- Where's the butler?
He's gone.
- Is he really?
Good.
Bring me something to eat.
Simo, come to the office.
I asked you here because all the others have gone already.
The house is indeed rather empty.
- I must talk to somebody - or I'll lose my mind.
I've already had a few dizzy spells - although I've lately eaten more than usually.
There's nothing wrong with my appetite.
But no matter how much I eat -
I feel empty somehow.
Emptiness...
Isn't it extraordinary?
However, I've made up my mind.
I'm going to sell everything to Wallenberg.
The way Klaus lusted for power was admirable - but basically he, rest his soul, was a mere nibbler.
Before I sign the deal and embark on my long journey -
as far as the night lasts -
I want to ease my soul and unburden my heart.
You can't betray me, we've been friends since childhood.
Do you know how my father died?
- Klaus poisoned him.
Wrong.
I did it.
Klaus gave my father poison but in small doses - in order to weaken his heart slowly.
I didn't get on so well with my father myself - so I let Klaus continue.
Finally I got tired of waiting - and I decided to take care of it once and for all.
I discovered where Klaus had hidden his poison.
One night I managed to sneak in before him - and I changed the contents of the bottle to a stronger stuff.
Hearing Klaus coming, I slipped through a side door - and hurried to my own room to wait.
I didn't sleep a wink that night.
Hunger finally drove me to the kitchen to find something to eat.
Only then did curiosity force me out of my hole - to discover the outcome of my plot.
You know the rest.
Pour us both a drink, will you?
You know, Simo.
I loved Ophelia dearly...
You can start packing.
- I've done it already.
We can go.
Songs, they keep changing with the passing years
Time takes so much away
But will we ever change?
And where is taking us the coming day?
Life may seem so hard when a storm is blowing
If you're looking for a brighter day
But the tune of tomorrow is created today
Understanding will show us the way
We're all here but for this one life
So, try to find a friend
And remember:
Tomorrow will be a new day
A day that will give you everything
Could it be that the best is yet to come?
That is my dearest wish
Or could it be that tomorrow will never dawn?
And everything will remain as it is?

[ALL CHEERING]
See, that's some real American music.
[MEN CHEERING]
I'm glad we came out tonight.
The soul buzz at the base like to have drove me crazy.
[MEN CHEERING]
[TALKING AND CHEERING STOP]
You get the feeling we're not wanted here, brother Don?
Looks that way to me.
We definitely change the complexion of things around here, that's for sure.
I'm trying real hard to learn that new handshake
I've seen you boys doing.
I can never figured out why it takes homeboys 10 minutes just to say hello.
Must not have a whole lot else to do.
Yeah, maybe they need all that time just to figure out what they say.
Or maybe he needs a little dancing...
Do the bugaloo.
I thought it was the boogaloo.
What do you boys want?
Hey, look, Percell said he'd meet us here.
Well, you don't see him, do you?
I knew he'd have more class than to hang out in a joint like this?
Yeah, you can get going about 10 seconds ago, boy.
Did he call you "boy" or "Roy?"
Hey, man, let's get out of here.
Four beers now.
Uh-uh.
You know, I may have to ride the same buses and use the same toilets as y'all, but there ain't nothing to say I got to socialize with you.
Now, I know there ain't no signs up here spelling out for you loud and clear, but you know the deal.
In case you ain't heard, all deals are off.
Don't do it, man.
I'm warning you.
Man, you ain't nothing to me.
Let 'em be, boys.
Come on!
You got him!
All right!
There you go!
Oh, well.
What about those beers?
Not if I was dying of thirst.
Watch out, you guys.
You're bunching up.
Ambush!
Sniper!
Sniper!
[SHOUTING]
[GUNSHOTS FIRING]
Where's he at?
I don't know.
I think he's my 11:00.
I'm not sure.
Innis!
Yo.
I'm gonna cover for you.
You get the right flank.
Go!
Go!
I got you man.
I'll cover you!
Go!
Get him!
Oh!
Got him, man.
My leg!
My leg!
My leg!
They got him, man.
No!
Where the hell were you, man?
My gun jammed!
Mighty convenient time, sucker.
What are you saying?
You know what I'm saying.
I'm saying that I can't be losing people like this.
My gun jammed, man!
Let it go.
Let it go!
It's over.
Let it go.
It's over for him.
For me, it's just beginning.
Now, you get this scum out of my face and don't be asking me to cover for him.
Hey, Tucker, I don't want to hear that.
You know these weapons jam.
Jammed, huh?
MINISTER:
Thou preparest the table before me in the presence of mine enemies.
Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.
Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
These brave young men made the ultimate sacrifice for their brethren and for their country.
They have given their lives so that others might walk free.
[HELICOPTER APPROACHING]
They will not enjoy the bounties of life on this earth, so we ask you, oh, Lord... to welcome their souls into heaven.
Platoon dismissed.
What am I gonna tell his mother?
LT will write her.
That woman helped raise me, man.
I've got to write her.
She thought we were fools to volunteer for a second tour... but I just kept on pushing.
How come you came back?
I don't know.
Things in the world just got so crazy.
What the hell have I done?
Man, niggers around here are bad enough.
They're going crazy back home.
Burning down Detroit.
Most of it.
Big riot in New Jersey too, and some place in Maryland.
Man, this right brown boy wants to torch the whole damn country.
Well, where's he going to sleep afterwards, huh?
INNIS:
I don't know... but I tell you, it's serious.
Man, who knows what these boys are gonna do next.
You know, it's just like them trying to hang Darden's death on me.
If I wanted that nig dead, I'd have shot him straight out.
Nat's really crying about him being gone.
I'll tell you what.
With all these riots spreading like wildfire,
I reckon it's time us white folks stand up before they walk all over us.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, boy...
I reckon it's time we make a little...
statement of our own.
Oh, yeah.
I never showed this to you, did I?
No.
Put this up right up here in the doorway.
I can't believe it.
It look like they bombed the place.
Detroit, my home.
My uncle used to live about a block away from all of this.
If you can call being in the rat hole living.
I used to play right on this corner.
Forty people killed.
Something's gonna happen to my family.
Bad enough, the pigs shooting and gassing our people in their own homes, but look at who else is doing it, bringing in the honky troops to take care of business.
Some of them dudes were Vietnam vets, man.
Yeah.
They training them over here to annihilate us back there.
Black man shouldn't even be fighting this war.
Maybe it's like Muhammad Ali said,
"No Vietcong ever called me nigger."
Amen.
I hear that.
[GUYS WHOOPING AND CHEERING]
Oh, no.
Tell me I ain't seeing this, man.
[CHEERING AND LAUGHING]
Yeah, man, you seeing it, but you ain't gonna be seeing it for long.
Let's go tear that sucker down.
Now, just be cool, man.
When the officers see it, they'll make them take it down.
Those peckerwoods down home call you "Uncle Johnson?"
Look, just back off, Tucker.
Now, trash like Innis is gonna always be around.
Look, man.
If you're selling that "slow change" jive, this is one blood who ain't buying.
Now, let's go grab that rag.
Whoo-hoo!
That's real white of you, Innis.
Thank you.
But it got to come down.
I don't think you're the man for the job, Tucker.
You're disrespecting every black man in the unit.
I'm real sorry you blacks take it that way.
Man, you all are sure getting sensitive lately.
You hear what your people are doing back home?
Man, I think it's a crying shame, all that freedom.
Think about it.
I think you ought to be taking down the Yankee flag.
Take it down, Innis, before there's trouble.
Ain't gonna be no trouble,
Johnson.
Now, you from down home.
You show some sense.
You just take your boys and walk away.
Who you calling "boy," Innis?
Take it down.
Hold it...
like you said, I'm from down home.
I'll take it down.
Yeah, you go get it.
Sorry, boy.
Just an accident.
Just like your gun jamming for Darden, right?
Break it up!
The flag comes down.
Get off me.
I'll get you next time, man.
The objective is to coordinate search Binh Jurang, maybe pick up some NVA activity out of there tonight.
You'll set up a night defensive position near the LZ.
Keep LPs out all night and move on Binh Jurang in the morning.
Aren't we telegraphing the operation by leaving this afternoon?
The bad guys are supposed to think you're part of Alpha company's sweep of the valley.
Once you've secured the hamlet,
Lieutenant Minh, your job will be--
My job will be to find and interrogate
Vietcong sympathizers.
I know my job well, captain.
Well, enough said, then.
You got any questions?
We'd like to delay going out for a couple of days.
We're not sure we can control the men.
Tucker.
Captain, don't get me wrong now.
That man's a good soldier.
He got a bronze star and a silver star his first tour here.
It's just sometimes these guys go over the edge, and-- and it's impossible to get them back.
I'd like to be able to help you guys out, but brigade says this one is important.
Well, then, I think we ought to transfer Tucker and Innis out.
This racial stuff is blowing up all over the place.
If I move Tucker and Innis on to somebody else,
I may get even worse in return.
No, you deal with them now.
Yes, sir.
Looks like our ride's here.
Hey, you guys ready for another one?
Ready for you to didi, white meat.
Lighten up, dude.
Percell, don't play that trash.
Besides, he's the best shot in the platoon.
So what?
Why don't you go over with Innis and your other honky confederates?
PERCELL:
Because I'm over here.
I don't think like those guys, Tucker.
I was taught to judge a man by what he does, not his color.
What do you want, the Nobel Peace Prize?
[CHUCKLES]
Wow, Tucker, you and Innis got a lot more in common than you know.
You guys aren't buying this stuff, right?
Look, don't put me in the same breath as that cracker.
Then do me the same courtesy.
Why don't you guys lay off, man.
Now, look, he ain't got nothing to it.
Get hip, farmer boy, before it's too late.
The time is coming when you're gonna have to choose sides.
Well, the time's here when we're going on a mission-- together.
[♪♪♪]
I want two of that.
You want one of these?
You want two of these?
Yeah.
For one piece...
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, thank you.
You're welcome.
That ought to fix them, Jeremiah.
Yeah, I reckon.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Time to establish a little brotherhood.
All right.
Hey, there, Johnson.
What you want, Innis?
Now, no need to be unfriendly.
I just wanted to bury the hatchet and the fence, all that good stuff.
You mean bury the hatchet in my back, right?
I'm talking about brotherhood, Johnson, you know.
Let's get rid of all that-- that nigger and honky talk, and let's get some equality here.
Hey, look.
I don't know what your game is, all right, but I ain't playing.
Game?
Just democracy.
We over here to protect the world from the international communist conspiracy, and I reckon we won't do much a job of it if we're always at each other's throats.
Am I right?
Well, action speaks louder than words.
And you going to see some real good ones.
Let's smoke the peace pipe on it, huh?
Thanks, but I don't smoke.
I take very good.
Oh, you likey menthol, huh?
Well, why not?
Let's let everybody in on this deal, white... black... and yellow.
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey.
[SPEAKS VIETNAMESE]
What in the hell do you think you're doing?
Oh, relax, sarge.
Don't get your eyes crossed over some gook.
You call me sergeant.
And that ain't a gook.
That's a soldier.
He's got his butt on the line out here just as much as anybody.
Sounds like Yankee talk to me.
Oh, just listen to yourself, would you, please, Innis?
You know what scares me most about you, Innis, is I might have ended up something like you.
How's that?
You wouldn't understand because you think you're an original, don't you?
Huh?
Well, you ain't.
I spent a whole lifetime around people like you, and what you got is a case of the white trash syndrome, boy.
And you got it real bad.
Equality, huh?
I say we ought to frag the sucker.
You gonna do it?
What about you, Marcus?
You wouldn't be shedding any tears if we did.
Hey, you're talking about murder, man.
It sounds more like pest control to me.
I thought I was talking about self-defense.
The clown's already started a fight with you.
Now, he's trying to blow up cigarettes in your face.
You ain't the kind of man who wouldn't defend yourself.
Now, you know better than that.
Suppose you was in Detroit, man...
Saw all these honkies coming to burn down your crib, put your family out in the street, or worse.
Yeah?
Try and imagine it, man.
What would you do?
You know what I'd do.
If anybody mess with my family, man,
I don't care who it is, I'd frag 'em.
That's what we talking about, blood.
Family.
All right, Jenkins.
Make sure you've got a clear field of fire at all times here.
All right?
Taylor, you all right?
Fine, sarge.
All right.
All right.
[♪♪♪]
[GULPS]
Look, I told you, sir, I was asleep.
Is this your bayonet?
Now, everybody knows
I keep green tape on my bayonet--
Johnson, is this your bayonet?
Yes, sir.
ANDERSON:
Well, it's also the bayonet that wound up in Innis' back.
Now, how do you explain that?
I can't explain it.
It didn't just jump out of your scabbard, man.
Nobody saw you sleeping.
Nobody saw me kill Innis.
And, look, if I did kill him, you think I'd be dumb enough to leave my bayonet there?
Marvin, everybody saw you guys going at it.
LT, this is Johnson we're talking about.
Taylor, get out of here.
He ain't no killer.
Taylor.
But, LT..
Taylor.
He ain't no killer.
Hey, look, why are you trying to pin this on me, damn it?
Now, you know what kind of soldier
I am, lieutenant.
All right, Johnson.
Now, we're pulling out of here in a few minutes.
Now, the body and the bayonet are going back to brigade.
I got to tell you, man, they're gonna do a full investigation at CID.
That's it.
I'd love to scrap this whole mission, but the old man told me battalion said no way.
Now, LT, I know you don't think Johnson did it.
Under ordinary circumstances,
I'd say no.
But this racial crap has got everybody's blood boiling.
Damn.
Marvin.
For what it's worth, I don't think you did it.
Now ain't the time, Danny.
Well, I just wanted to let--
Danny!
Have it your way.
What you doing, Percell?
I'm sneaking around looking for someone to stab.
Got any suggestions?
You think it's funny, huh?
A joke?
This outfit, this war, the whole damn thing's turned into a joke.
I got no time to be fat mouthing with some honky.
Hey, look, take the time, Tucker.
Take the time.
Do me a favor.
Enlighten me to what this blackness is all about.
Don't be pushing me, man.
I ain't pushing, Tucker.
Look, I'm just a hick from Montana.
I hardly ever saw a black man till I joined the Army.
So what's your point?
It seems to me that y'all had the short end of the stick for a long time.
But why do you want to turn your backs on people that have nothing against you?
Aw, man.
Don't "Aw, man" me, Tucker.
Tell me something.
What do you want, whitey?
A little bedtime story about being poor and fighting the rats for a bed, about seeing my father's spirit break and watching my mother turn into an old woman before she was 40?
About doing the tour in 'Nam and then going back home to the same old garbage?
Did you think the world was gonna change?
I don't know what I thought, man.
I went back proud to have done my duty for my country.
Really thought I found a home in the Army.
What happened?
Nothing, man... except maybe the rats got fatter.
Man, I could have died over here fighting in this white man's war, but back home, I ain't no better than dirt.
So you came back here.
That's because I don't know where I belong no more.
So forgive me if I can't let go of my hatred.
I got nothing else to hold on to.
We got to stick together, guys.
That Johnson's dangerous.
Johnson is the best soldier in this platoon.
Yeah, and he didn't kill that jerk, either.
That "jerk" was my buddy.
What are you, Baker, a nigger-lover?
No.
He loves greasers.
That's why we're partners.
Whose side are you on?
Not yours, bro.
When you're done with the bloods, you're probably gonna come after the Spics.
and then it'll be the Jewish lieutenant, probably surfers after that.
Well, ain't that just--
Get out of here, man.
This stuff's bringing me way down, and I don't like it.
So why don't you just didi out of my area.
All right, people, let's saddle up.
Let's get it done.
Just wanted you to know that the brothers are behind you, man.
Maybe they can help find the guy that did Innis.
Look, in case you don't know, murder ain't my thing.
Look, just be cool, blood.
We ain't gonna let you get railroaded.
Hey, look, do me a favor, Tucker.
Just stay out of my life, you hear?
Partner's got no appreciation at all, man.
[♪♪♪]
Yeah, they're getting real confident now.
We're gonna have to block off that far corner.
Yeah, yeah.
Horn.
Horn.
Tiger Six, this is Bravo Two Six.
Over.
Roger, Two Six.
Six, I want you to block on the east.
We'll come in on the west and the south.
Go.
Roger, Two Six.
We come when you need us.
All right.
I want you to take the first squad and take the third squad.
You sweep around to the west, we'll just head on in.
And let's take some prisoners.
If they'll let us.
[♪♪♪]
[SCREAMS]
Watch it!
Punji stakes!
That sucker's gonna beat it!
Go!
Flank him!
Flank him!
Get it on!
Go!
Three teams on the hooches.
Taylor!
Good work, Johnson.
All right, I want teams of two on the hooches.
Keep your eyes peeled.
There's probably NVA in there.
All right, Tucker, Percell.
Yo!
ANDERSON:
You start down left.
Johnson, Wall.
Yo.
You got the middle.
Taylor, Hall.
Up top there.
Let's move.
I said move it!
What in the hell is wrong with you?
Can't you see, sarge?
Nobody in this outfit wants their back to anybody else.
I say the hell with y'all.
Get up!
No, stay down!
Stay where you are.
Why?
If we move, they'll kill us.
I'll get lieutenant to call in artillery.
Damn it.
[GUNSHOTS]
Nothing.
We had them, and now we got nothing.
And where the hell were you guys, huh?
I'll tell you something.
I'm ashamed to have you guys in my command.
Not only did we lose the intelligence, we lost the enemy.
And you know what?
While you guys were waging your private little war, these guys got greased.
If the honky was looking instead of being a crybaby, none of this would've happened.
I suppose you wouldn't have said a word if you'd been stuck.
In the first place,
I wouldn't have been dumb enough to get stuck, and I wouldn't have screamed if I had.
I reckon animals don't feel pain like real people.
You gob of spit.
Shut up.
Just shut up!
Will you listen to what I'm saying here, or are you too thick?
Now, why, huh?
Why are you doing this?
TUCKER:
Because it's the truth.
No, the truth is you don't want to see anybody get along.
Give you nothing to complain about.
Now, how can I trust you dudes when you go and hang Johnson out to dry?
Johnson is not hung yet.
And I'm going to make sure he gets a fair trial.
Oh, white man's justice.
You know what, Tucker?
There is no room here for what you're spreading.
One more time, that's one more time for all of you, and you're all gonna be hung out to dry.
You ain't seen nothing yet, boy.
Okay, Ron, could you get that on the left side?
Morales, get your butt over here.
Let's go.
Okay, Sergeant.
I'll be right there.
It's a shame this thing was ever pulled down.
Well, this rebel's gonna put it back up.
Where are you going, Alan?
Outside, sir.
That belonged to the effects of PFC Innis.
You know, I got a lot of respect for Southern courage and pride, but this thing is over, Alan.
Now that I got my baby all cleaned up,
I'm gonna be getting into cutting, up till tomorrow noon.
I don't want nobody messing with me, either.
You may have to attend to business.
Hey, what are you, man?
Chairman of the board or something?
I'm just looking out for my own people, man.
Well, your jive is wearing real thin, bro.
RUIZ:
You know, when the war comes, what side you gonna put me on, huh?
Yeah, and what about me?
Yo, Johnson.
Yeah, sarge?
Get your stuff.
Where you taking him?
You got the need to know, soldier?
I got a need to find out.
Brothers are looking after brothers from now on.
TAYLOR:
Come on, sarge.
You know Johnson ain't did nothing.
You know as well as I do, Taylor,
I am only following orders here.
Don't worry, blood.
We ain't going to let them mess with you.
No, we won't.
Come on.
All right, listen, Marvin.
We're gonna get this whole mess cleared up and we're gonna get you back to soldiering like you ought to be.
You ain't got to fake it, sarge.
I'm in up to my neck, ain't I?
They don't have a witness.
They got a weapon.
Now all they need is a body to hang it on.
Specialist Johnson reporting as ordered, sir.
I'm sorry, Johnson.
I wish there was something I could do, but I have my orders.
So what happens next?
You stay in the CP tonight.
Tomorrow, you and I go for a chopper ride down to brigade.
I am sorry about this, Johnson, but once the CID gets into this stuff, it's out of my hands.
I have to follow procedure.
Yes, sir.
Lieutenant.
Let's get it together, brothers.
We ain't nothing if we sit here and let Johnson take all the heat.
Well, what are we gonna do?
We can't go take him back.
I say we can.
I don't want to see this happen.
What's it to you, white meat?
It's a lot to me.
Johnson's a good damn soldier, and he's my good friend.
I don't see why we all can't just get together and go see Captain Wallace.
Yeah, just like a committee.
You know, Percell, you becoming my main white liberal.
First, we form a committee.
Then, we discuss the problems for another five years while they put a hundred niggers behind bars.
Well, that's-
- Tucker, that's not the way it is.
Maybe you ought to leave it alone, Danny.
We've got to work this out between ourselves, okay?
You brothers with me or not?
You gonna be strong black men or you gonna be a bunch of Uncle Tom niggers?
Man, you talking about taking on the United States Army.
I'm talking about defending our own.
I say we take the brother back.
I don't know, man.
I'm with you, but we might be provoking a little more than we can handle.
The black man has always been the underdog.
Ain't nobody gonna defend us, so we damn well better defend ourselves.
If you brothers are with me...
Lock and load.
Probably get 20 years in Leavenworth.
Twenty years?
Hell, ought to put his butt in front of a firing squad.
Relax, Hall, before you have a hemorrhage.
It's those niggers-- a bunch of them with guns.
Coming here?
I don't know.
Maybe to CP.
Looks like one war ain't enough for these boys.
Let's go.
Listen up, whiteys.
We want Johnson out here now.
He stays where he is, Tucker.
You ain't the law around here.
Only law I see around here is a bunch of honkies.
We do law for black folks now.
You get in the way, you pay the price.
Go head on.
Come on.
It's got to happen sooner or later.
[GUNS COCKING]
Truth is, I'd rather shoot you all than the gooks.
Suits me just fine, boy.
But maybe you'd like us to turn our backs first.
Ain't that the way it's always been?
Innis is the one your boys got in the back.
ANDERSON:
Hey!
Now, you listen up.
The only people you're gonna be fighting are the NVA that you let get away this morning.
I tell you the honest to God truth, just looking at you pukes gives me a real bad case of the jaws.
We're coming to get Johnson back.
You did, did you?
Yeah, and we aim to take him back.
Well, you got a little problem, Tucker.
What's that?
You want Johnson, you're gonna have to come through me.
So you come on up.
Not in my platoon!
Not in my platoon.
This is where I live, and I will do anything necessary to stop this.
You take this garbage someplace else.
You find something funny there, son?
You know, I got the real impression that you thought something was funny there, didn't you?
No, sir.
No, sir.
All right, then, why don't you take your sense of humor and get on out of here?
Taylor,
I'm real disappointed in you, son.
Real disappointed.
What about Johnson?
He's innocent.
You heard me.
He's innocent.
Tam, the little ARVN soldier that-- that Innis messed with, they found his fingerprints on the bayonet.
Goldman and Wallace are with him now.
Tam?
Tam, yes, the little guy that Innis gave the cigarette to.
You watch your manners, gentlemen.
Tucker, can I talk to you for a minute?
You can talk to me all night.
You're in charge.
You know, uh, your last tour over here in country was really something, Tucker-- the Medal of Valor, two Purple Hearts.
I mean, that's some heavy-duty soldiering,
Tucker.
Put it all with a dime and I might get a cup of coffee.
Only if it's a cheap cafe, you will.
But that's not what it's all about, anyway, is it?
You know what impressed me most was that soldier's medal you got for pulling that woman out of that river.
You almost got yourself wasted in the process, and she wasn't even the same color as you are.
That's all, sarge?
No, it's not.
You're a good soldier, Tucker.
You're a damn good soldier.
The men in the platoon respect you and look up to you.
You could be a model for the new guys coming in.
You can stick your platoon.
Brigade's forming a new LRRP unit and I'm transferring out of here.
And don't think your problem's over.
The real storm is on the horizon.
[♪♪♪]
[♪♪♪]
Not in my platoon!
Yee-haw!
Whoo!
I think I'm in love.
"...
With a lonesome whistle Blowing"
"And the youngest dreamer Floating on the Rhine"
Sing it, girl.
"Like a freight train Leaving town"
"Not knowing where I'm bound"
"And the one Who changed my mind"
"But Mama tried"
"And I turned 21"
"And freezing Doing life..."
Whoo!
"...
But Mama tried"
"Mama tried To raise me better"
"But a bleeding heart knows"
"That there's only me To blame"
"'Cause Mama tried"
See, that's some real American music.
I'm glad we came out tonight.
The soul buzz at the base like to have drove me crazy.
You get the feeling we're not wanted here, brother Don?
Looks that way to me.
We definitely change the complexion of things around here, that's for sure.
I'm trying real hard to learn that new handshake
I've seen you boys doing.
I can never figured out why it takes homeboys 10 minutes just to say hello.
Must not have a whole lot else to do.
Yeah, maybe they need all that time just to figure out what they say.
Or maybe he needs a little dancing...
Do the bugaloo.
I thought it was the boogaloo.
What do you boys want?
Hey, look, Percell said he'd meet us here.
Well, you don't see him, do you?
I knew he'd have more class than to hang out in a joint like this?
Yeah, you can get going about 10 seconds ago, boy.
Did he call you "boy" or "Roy?"
Hey, man, let's get out of here.
Four beers now.
Uh-uh.
You know, I may have to ride the same buses and use the same toilets as y'all, but there ain't nothing to say I got to socialize with you.
Now, I know there ain't no signs up here spelling out for you loud and clear, but you know the deal.
In case you ain't heard, all deals are off.
Don't do it, man.
I'm warning you.
Man, you ain't nothing to me.
Let 'em be, boys.
Come on!
You got him!
All right!
There you go!
Oh, well.
What about those beers?
Not if I was dying of thirst.
Watch out, you guys.
You're bunching up.
Ambush!
Sniper!
Sniper!
Where's he at?
I don't know.
I think he's my 11:00.
I'm not sure.
Innis!
Yo.
I'm gonna cover for you.
You get the right flank.
Go!
Go!
I got you man.
I'll cover you!
Go!
Get him!
Oh!
Got him, man.
My leg!
My leg!
My leg!
They got him, man.
No!
Where the hell were you, man?
My gun jammed!
Mighty convenient time, sucker.
What are you saying?
You know what I'm saying.
I'm saying that I can't be losing people like this.
My gun jammed, man!
Let it go.
Let it go!
It's over.
Let it go.
It's over for him.
For me, it's just beginning.
Now, you get this scum out of my face and don't be asking me to cover for him.
Hey, Tucker, I don't want to hear that.
You know these weapons jam.
Jammed, huh?
Thou preparest the table before me in the presence of mine enemies.
Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.
Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
These brave young men made the ultimate sacrifice for their brethren and for their country.
They have given their lives so that others might walk free.
They will not enjoy the bounties of life on this earth, so we ask you, oh, Lord... to welcome their souls into heaven.
Platoon dismissed.
What am I gonna tell his mother?
LT will write her.
That woman helped raise me, man.
I've got to write her.
She thought we were fools to volunteer for a second tour... but I just kept on pushing.
How come you came back?
I don't know.
Things in the world just got so crazy.
What the hell have I done?
Man, niggers around here are bad enough.
They're going crazy back home.
Burning down Detroit.
Most of it.
Big riot in New Jersey too, and some place in Maryland.
Man, this right brown boy wants to torch the whole damn country.
Well, where's he going to sleep afterwards, huh?
I don't know... but I tell you, it's serious.
Man, who knows what these boys are gonna do next.
You know, it's just like them trying to hang Darden's death on me.
If I wanted that nig dead, I'd have shot him straight out.
Nat's really crying about him being gone.
I'll tell you what.
With all these riots spreading like wildfire,
I reckon it's time us white folks stand up before they walk all over us.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, boy...
I reckon it's time we make a little...
statement of our own.
Oh, yeah.
I never showed this to you, did I?
No.
Put this up right up here in the doorway.
I can't believe it.
It look like they bombed the place.
Detroit, my home.
My uncle used to live about a block away from all of this.
If you can call being in the rat hole living.
I used to play right on this corner.
Forty people killed.
Something's gonna happen to my family.
Bad enough, the pigs shooting and gassing our people in their own homes, but look at who else is doing it, bringing in the honky troops to take care of business.
Some of them dudes were Vietnam vets, man.
Yeah.
They training them over here to annihilate us back there.
Black man shouldn't even be fighting this war.
Maybe it's like Muhammad Ali said,
"No Vietcong ever called me nigger."
Amen.
I hear that.
Oh, no.
Tell me I ain't seeing this, man.
Yeah, man, you seeing it, but you ain't gonna be seeing it for long.
Let's go tear that sucker down.
Now, just be cool, man.
When the officers see it, they'll make them take it down.
Those peckerwoods down home call you "Uncle Johnson?"
Look, just back off, Tucker.
Now, trash like Innis is gonna always be around.
Look, man.
If you're selling that "slow change" jive, this is one blood who ain't buying.
Now, let's go grab that rag.
Whoo-hoo!
That's real white of you, Innis.
Thank you.
But it got to come down.
I don't think you're the man for the job, Tucker.
You're disrespecting every black man in the unit.
I'm real sorry you blacks take it that way.
Man, you all are sure getting sensitive lately.
You hear what your people are doing back home?
Man, I think it's a crying shame, all that freedom.
Think about it.
I think you ought to be taking down the Yankee flag.
Take it down, Innis, before there's trouble.
Ain't gonna be no trouble,
Johnson.
Now, you from down home.
You show some sense.
You just take your boys and walk away.
Who you calling "boy," Innis?
Take it down.
Hold it...
like you said, I'm from down home.
I'll take it down.
Yeah, you go get it.
Sorry, boy.
Just an accident.
Just like your gun jamming for Darden, right?
Break it up!
The flag comes down.
Get off me.
I'll get you next time, man.
The objective is to coordinate search Binh Jurang, maybe pick up some NVA activity out of there tonight.
You'll set up a night defensive position near the LZ.
Keep LPs out all night and move on Binh Jurang in the morning.
Aren't we telegraphing the operation by leaving this afternoon?
The bad guys are supposed to think you're part of Alpha company's sweep of the valley.
Once you've secured the hamlet,
Lieutenant Minh, your job will be...
My job will be to find and interrogate
Vietcong sympathizers.
I know my job well, captain.
Well, enough said, then.
You got any questions?
We'd like to delay going out for a couple of days.
We're not sure we can control the men.
Tucker.
Captain, don't get me wrong now.
That man's a good soldier.
He got a bronze star and a silver star his first tour here.
It's just sometimes these guys go over the edge, and... and it's impossible to get them back.
I'd like to be able to help you guys out, but brigade says this one is important.
Well, then, I think we ought to transfer Tucker and Innis out.
This racial stuff is blowing up all over the place.
If I move Tucker and Innis on to somebody else,
I may get even worse in return.
No, you deal with them now.
Yes, sir.
Looks like our ride's here.
Hey, you guys ready for another one?
Ready for you to didi, white meat.
Lighten up, dude.
Percell, don't play that trash.
Besides, he's the best shot in the platoon.
So what?
Why don't you go over with Innis and your other honky confederates?
Because I'm over here.
I don't think like those guys, Tucker.
I was taught to judge a man by what he does, not his color.
What do you want, the Nobel Peace Prize?
Wow, Tucker, you and Innis got a lot more in common than you know.
You guys aren't buying this stuff, right?
Look, don't put me in the same breath as that cracker.
Then do me the same courtesy.
Why don't you guys lay off, man.
Now, look, he ain't got nothing to it.
Get hip, farmer boy, before it's too late.
The time is coming when you're gonna have to choose sides.
Well, the time's here when we're going on a mission...
together.
I want two of that.
You want one of these?
You want two of these?
Yeah.
For one piece...
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, thank you.
You're welcome.
That ought to fix them, Jeremiah.
Yeah, I reckon.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Time to establish a little brotherhood.
All right.
Hey, there, Johnson.
What you want, Innis?
Now, no need to be unfriendly.
I just wanted to bury the hatchet and the fence, all that good stuff.
You mean bury the hatchet in my back, right?
I'm talking about brotherhood, Johnson, you know.
Let's get rid of all that...
that nigger and honky talk, and let's get some equality here.
Hey, look.
I don't know what your game is, all right, but I ain't playing.
Game?
Just democracy.
We over here to protect the world from the international communist conspiracy, and I reckon we won't do much a job of it if we're always at each other's throats.
Am I right?
Well, action speaks louder than words.
And you going to see some real good ones.
Let's smoke the peace pipe on it, huh?
Thanks, but I don't smoke.
I take very good.
Oh, you likey menthol, huh?
Well, why not?
Let's let everybody in on this deal, white... black... and yellow.
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey.
What in the hell do you think you're doing?
Oh, relax, sarge.
Don't get your eyes crossed over some gook.
You call me sergeant.
And that ain't a gook.
That's a soldier.
He's got his butt on the line out here just as much as anybody.
Sounds like Yankee talk to me.
Oh, just listen to yourself, would you, please, Innis?
You know what scares me most about you, Innis, is I might have ended up something like you.
How's that?
You wouldn't understand because you think you're an original, don't you?
Huh?
Well, you ain't.
I spent a whole lifetime around people like you, and what you got is a case of the white trash syndrome, boy.
And you got it real bad.
Equality, huh?
I say we ought to frag the sucker.
You gonna do it?
What about you, Marcus?
You wouldn't be shedding any tears if we did.
Hey, you're talking about murder, man.
It sounds more like pest control to me.
I thought I was talking about self-defense.
The clown's already started a fight with you.
Now, he's trying to blow up cigarettes in your face.
You ain't the kind of man who wouldn't defend yourself.
Now, you know better than that.
Suppose you was in Detroit, man...
Saw all these honkies coming to burn down your crib, put your family out in the street, or worse.
Yeah?
Try and imagine it, man.
What would you do?
You know what I'd do.
If anybody mess with my family, man,
I don't care who it is, I'd frag 'em.
That's what we talking about, blood.
Family.
All right, Jenkins.
Make sure you've got a clear field of fire at all times here.
All right?
Taylor, you all right?
Fine, sarge.
All right.
All right.
Look, I told you, sir, I was asleep.
Is this your bayonet?
Now, everybody knows
I keep green tape on my bayonet...
Johnson, is this your bayonet?
Yes, sir.
Well, it's also the bayonet that wound up in Innis' back.
Now, how do you explain that?
I can't explain it.
It didn't just jump out of your scabbard, man.
Nobody saw you sleeping.
Nobody saw me kill Innis.
And, look, if I did kill him, you think I'd be dumb enough to leave my bayonet there?
Marvin, everybody saw you guys going at it.
LT, this is Johnson we're talking about.
Taylor, get out of here.
He ain't no killer.
Taylor.
But, LT..
Taylor.
He ain't no killer.
Hey, look, why are you trying to pin this on me, damn it?
Now, you know what kind of soldier
I am, lieutenant.
All right, Johnson.
Now, we're pulling out of here in a few minutes.
Now, the body and the bayonet are going back to brigade.
I got to tell you, man, they're gonna do a full investigation at CID.
That's it.
I'd love to scrap this whole mission, but the old man told me battalion said no way.
Now, LT, I know you don't think Johnson did it.
Under ordinary circumstances,
I'd say no.
But this racial crap has got everybody's blood boiling.
Damn.
Marvin.
For what it's worth, I don't think you did it.
Now ain't the time, Danny.
Well, I just wanted to let...
Danny!
Have it your way.
What you doing, Percell?
I'm sneaking around looking for someone to stab.
Got any suggestions?
You think it's funny, huh?
A joke?
This outfit, this war, the whole damn thing's turned into a joke.
I got no time to be fat mouthing with some honky.
Hey, look, take the time, Tucker.
Take the time.
Do me a favor.
Enlighten me to what this blackness is all about.
Don't be pushing me, man.
I ain't pushing, Tucker.
Look, I'm just a hick from Montana.
I hardly ever saw a black man till I joined the Army.
So what's your point?
It seems to me that y'all had the short end of the stick for a long time.
But why do you want to turn your backs on people that have nothing against you?
Aw, man.
Don't "Aw, man" me, Tucker.
Tell me something.
What do you want, whitey?
A little bedtime story about being poor and fighting the rats for a bed, about seeing my father's spirit break and watching my mother turn into an old woman before she was 40?
About doing the tour in 'Nam and then going back home to the same old garbage?
Did you think the world was gonna change?
I don't know what I thought, man.
I went back proud to have done my duty for my country.
Really thought I found a home in the Army.
What happened?
Nothing, man... except maybe the rats got fatter.
Man, I could have died over here fighting in this white man's war, but back home, I ain't no better than dirt.
So you came back here.
That's because I don't know where I belong no more.
So forgive me if I can't let go of my hatred.
I got nothing else to hold on to.
We got to stick together, guys.
That Johnson's dangerous.
Johnson is the best soldier in this platoon.
Yeah, and he didn't kill that jerk, either.
That "jerk" was my buddy.
What are you, Baker, a nigger-lover?
No.
He loves greasers.
That's why we're partners.
Whose side are you on?
Not yours, bro.
When you're done with the bloods, you're probably gonna come after the Spics.
And then it'll be the Jewish lieutenant, probably surfers after that.
Well, ain't that just...
Get out of here, man.
This stuff's bringing me way down, and I don't like it.
So why don't you just didi out of my area.
All right, people, let's saddle up.
Let's get it done.
Just wanted you to know that the brothers are behind you, man.
Maybe they can help find the guy that did Innis.
Look, in case you don't know, murder ain't my thing.
Look, just be cool, blood.
We ain't gonna let you get railroaded.
Hey, look, do me a favor, Tucker.
Just stay out of my life, you hear?
Partner's got no appreciation at all, man.
Yeah, they're getting real confident now.
We're gonna have to block off that far corner.
Yeah, yeah.
Horn.
Horn.
Tiger Six, this is Bravo Two Six.
Over.
Roger, Two Six.
Six, I want you to block on the east.
We'll come in on the west and the south.
Go.
Roger, Two Six.
We come when you need us.
All right.
I want you to take the first squad and take the third squad.
You sweep around to the west, we'll just head on in.
And let's take some prisoners.
If they'll let us.
Watch it!
Punji stakes!
That sucker's gonna beat it!
Go!
Flank him!
Flank him!
Get it on!
Go!
Three teams on the hooches.
Taylor!
Good work, Johnson.
All right, I want teams of two on the hooches.
Keep your eyes peeled.
There's probably NVA in there.
All right, Tucker, Percell.
Yo!
You start down left.
Johnson, Wall.
Yo.
You got the middle.
Taylor, Hall.
Up top there.
Let's move.
I said move it!
What in the hell is wrong with you?
Can't you see, sarge?
Nobody in this outfit wants their back to anybody else.
I say the hell with y'all.
Get up!
No, stay down!
Stay where you are.
Why?
If we move, they'll kill us.
I'll get lieutenant to call in artillery.
Damn it.
Nothing.
We had them, and now we got nothing.
And where the hell were you guys, huh?
I'll tell you something.
I'm ashamed to have you guys in my command.
Not only did we lose the intelligence, we lost the enemy.
And you know what?
While you guys were waging your private little war, these guys got greased.
If the honky was looking instead of being a crybaby, none of this would've happened.
I suppose you wouldn't have said a word if you'd been stuck.
In the first place,
I wouldn't have been dumb enough to get stuck, and I wouldn't have screamed if I had.
I reckon animals don't feel pain like real people.
You gob of spit.
Shut up.
Just shut up!
Will you listen to what I'm saying here, or are you too thick?
Now, why, huh?
Why are you doing this?
Because it's the truth.
No, the truth is you don't want to see anybody get along.
Give you nothing to complain about.
Now, how can I trust you dudes when you go and hang Johnson out to dry?
Johnson is not hung yet.
And I'm going to make sure he gets a fair trial.
Oh, white man's justice.
You know what, Tucker?
There is no room here for what you're spreading.
One more time, that's one more time for all of you, and you're all gonna be hung out to dry.
You ain't seen nothing yet, boy.
Okay, Ron, could you get that on the left side?
Morales, get your butt over here.
Let's go.
Okay, Sergeant.
I'll be right there.
It's a shame this thing was ever pulled down.
Well, this rebel's gonna put it back up.
Where are you going, Alan?
Outside, sir.
That belonged to the effects of PFC Innis.
You know, I got a lot of respect for Southern courage and pride, but this thing is over, Alan.
Now that I got my baby all cleaned up,
I'm gonna be getting into cutting, up till tomorrow noon.
I don't want nobody messing with me, either.
You may have to attend to business.
Hey, what are you, man?
Chairman of the board or something?
I'm just looking out for my own people, man.
Well, your jive is wearing real thin, bro.
You know, when the war comes, what side you gonna put me on, huh?
Yeah, and what about me?
Yo, Johnson.
Yeah, sarge?
Get your stuff.
Where you taking him?
You got the need to know, soldier?
I got a need to find out.
Brothers are looking after brothers from now on.
Come on, sarge.
You know Johnson ain't did nothing.
You know as well as I do, Taylor,
I am only following orders here.
Don't worry, blood.
We ain't going to let them mess with you.
No, we won't.
Come on.
All right, listen, Marvin.
We're gonna get this whole mess cleared up and we're gonna get you back to soldiering like you ought to be.
You ain't got to fake it, sarge.
I'm in up to my neck, ain't I?
They don't have a witness.
They got a weapon.
Now all they need is a body to hang it on.
Specialist Johnson reporting as ordered, sir.
I'm sorry, Johnson.
I wish there was something I could do, but I have my orders.
So what happens next?
You stay in the CP tonight.
Tomorrow, you and I go for a chopper ride down to brigade.
I am sorry about this, Johnson, but once the CID gets into this stuff, it's out of my hands.
I have to follow procedure.
Yes, sir.
Lieutenant.
Let's get it together, brothers.
We ain't nothing if we sit here and let Johnson take all the heat.
Well, what are we gonna do?
We can't go take him back.
I say we can.
I don't want to see this happen.
What's it to you, white meat?
It's a lot to me.
Johnson's a good damn soldier, and he's my good friend.
I don't see why we all can't just get together and go see Captain Wallace.
Yeah, just like a committee.
You know, Percell, you becoming my main white liberal.
First, we form a committee.
Then, we discuss the problems for another five years while they put a hundred niggers behind bars.
Well, that's...
Tucker, that's not the way it is.
Maybe you ought to leave it alone, Danny.
We've got to work this out between ourselves, okay?
You brothers with me or not?
You gonna be strong black men or you gonna be a bunch of Uncle Tom niggers?
Man, you talking about taking on the United States Army.
I'm talking about defending our own.
I say we take the brother back.
I don't know, man.
I'm with you, but we might be provoking a little more than we can handle.
The black man has always been the underdog.
Ain't nobody gonna defend us, so we damn well better defend ourselves.
If you brothers are with me...
Lock and load.
Probably get 20 years in Leavenworth.
Twenty years?
Hell, ought to put his butt in front of a firing squad.
Relax, Hall, before you have a hemorrhage.
It's those niggers...
a bunch of them with guns.
Coming here?
I don't know.
Maybe to CP.
Looks like one war ain't enough for these boys.
Let's go.
Listen up, whiteys.
We want Johnson out here now.
He stays where he is, Tucker.
You ain't the law around here.
Only law I see around here is a bunch of honkies.
We do law for black folks now.
You get in the way, you pay the price.
Go head on.
Come on.
It's got to happen sooner or later.
Truth is, I'd rather shoot you all than the gooks.
Suits me just fine, boy.
But maybe you'd like us to turn our backs first.
Ain't that the way it's always been?
Innis is the one your boys got in the back.
Hey!
Now, you listen up.
The only people you're gonna be fighting are the NVA that you let get away this morning.
I tell you the honest to God truth, just looking at you pukes gives me a real bad case of the jaws.
We're coming to get Johnson back.
You did, did you?
Yeah, and we aim to take him back.
Well, you got a little problem, Tucker.
What's that?
You want Johnson, you're gonna have to come through me.
So you come on up.
Not in my platoon!
Not in my platoon.
This is where I live, and I will do anything necessary to stop this.
You take this garbage someplace else.
You find something funny there, son?
You know, I got the real impression that you thought something was funny there, didn't you?
No, sir.
No, sir.
All right, then, why don't you take your sense of humor and get on out of here?
Taylor,
I'm real disappointed in you, son.
Real disappointed.
What about Johnson?
He's innocent.
You heard me.
He's innocent.
Tam, the little ARVN soldier that... that Innis messed with, they found his fingerprints on the bayonet.
Goldman and Wallace are with him now.
Tam?
Tam, yes, the little guy that Innis gave the cigarette to.
You watch your manners, gentlemen.
Tucker, can I talk to you for a minute?
You can talk to me all night.
You're in charge.
You know, uh, your last tour over here in country was really something, Tucker... the Medal of Valor, two Purple Hearts.
I mean, that's some heavy-duty soldiering,
Tucker.
Put it all with a dime and I might get a cup of coffee.
Only if it's a cheap cafe, you will.
But that's not what it's all about, anyway, is it?
You know what impressed me most was that soldier's medal you got for pulling that woman out of that river.
You almost got yourself wasted in the process, and she wasn't even the same color as you are.
That's all, sarge?
No, it's not.
You're a good soldier, Tucker.
You're a damn good soldier.
The men in the platoon respect you and look up to you.
You could be a model for the new guys coming in.
You can stick your platoon.
Brigade's forming a new LRRP unit and I'm transferring out of here.
And don't think your problem's over.
The real storm is on the horizon.
MISSION OF THE DUTY
The Armed Forces had been opened to all the races, for President Harry S. Truman In 26 of July of 1948.
Presidential order # 9981
I find who I am gotten passionate.
The first one that I remember myself to have known, was a solitary delator.
e an adolescent dream.
Girl, Sings!
In a load train that left the city, without knowing she took where me.
e made me to nothing to move of opinion, but Mother, I have plans.
E I fulfilled 21 in the arrest.
condemned the life imprisionment without conditional release.
It is a doçura, girl!
but, mother I have plans, I have plans. mother, I plan optimum.
therefore I rejected its game.
It only blamed me, but, Mother I have plans.
They see, this is that it is true North American music.
It is I am contented to come this night.
These black brothers of the base leaving are me wild.
He does not have the sensation of that they do not want in them here, Darden brother?
He is what he seems.
Definitively we will change the complexity of the things this way. clearly!
He looks at, Allen.
I am wanting to learn the new greeting that vi its boys to make.
I never understood because they take 10 minutes almost alone to say alô.
They must not have more nothing that to make.
Perhaps they need all this time to understand what they had said.
Or perhaps a little need dance.
The Bugaloo.
I thought that this age the Mongoloo.
What they make here?
It looks at here, the Percell, it said we would find that it here.
Well, vocês does not see it, certain?
I find that we have more classroom to come in one pocilga as this.
It is, can think to leave in 10 seconds, boy.
It called it youngster or male.
We go, to leave daqui.
- Four beers, now.
- Not.
We can catch bus the same and to the same use vocês bathroom that.
I find that it does not have nothing compels that me to be social with you.
I know that it does not have form to retroact I was clearly?
but they know the agreement.
In case of that it does not know, the agreements are suspended.
I do not make this man, saying I am you.
You are not you are welcome pra me.
They, boys leave.
Here they are.
Well, and these beers?
I do not drink it nor that it dies of headquarters.
They have care youngsters, are if grouping.
Ambush!

For the right!
- Where they are?
- I do not know.
I find that they are to the 11,00 in point.
I am not certain.
- Innis!
- Here.
To cover I go you!
You go for the right flank!
He goes!
- He goes!
- I go with you, we go!
Will cover I them!

It covers!
It covers!
They catch it!

Well in this hour, idiot.
What you speaking?
You know what I am speaking!
I am saying that I cannot more lose my friends thus.
- My weapon if stopped!
- It arrives!
this leaves it finished!
It is finished for it.
Pra me only you starting.
Now, they take off this excrement of my front and they do not ask for to me for cobriz it.
It looks at Tucker, I do not want to hear this!
You know that these weapons stop.
Stopped, he is?
You prepare a table before me, in the presence of my enemies, unge my head with oil, my cálice overflows.
Certainly that the goodness and the mercy... they will every day follow... me of my life:
E I will inhabit in the house Mr. per long days.
These young braves they had given its lives for its brothers, and the Country.
They had given its lives so that others walk free.
They do not go rewards to enjoy it of the life in this land.
To thus we ask for you, mine Sir that he receives these souls in the sky.
Squad!
excused!
What I go to say its mother?
The lieutenant goes to write.
This woman helped me to grow.
I have that to write it.
It found that we were fools for in them signing up in this 2a. mission.
but, I followed insisting.
How he was that he came back?
I do not know.
The things in the world are being insane people.
That devils I made?
It is the blacks for are very rebelled there.
They are wild, when they come back pra house.
Setting on fire Detroit.
Great part.
Also it has riots in New Jersey and some parts of Maryland.
These blacks want to set on fire the cursed Country all.
Well, where they go to sleep later?
I do not know, but I know that he is well serious.
Who knows what these boys go to make later.
They know, is as they treat in them blame, me for the death of the Darden.
If it wanted to see this black died, I myself would have shot.
Appositive that they are crying, because it was itself.
I say you, with all these riots if it proliferates as fire I find that it is in the hour of us the whites, raising in them before that they pass in them superficially.
Oh, skies!
I find that of this time we will make a small declaration of our good.
- We never show them, certain?
- Not.
They put it well here, in the entrance.
I cannot believe in this, had bombed the place all.
Detroit, my piece!
My uncle lives to one squares of everything this.
If he can call itself, to live is as to be in a nest of rats.
I played well in this esquina.
I help you with this, I caught.
Forty dead soldiers.
My family goes to be worried.
Already it is bad that these pigs, kill our people in its proper place.
but, she sees more who would make it.
That they send troops of whites so that they put in charge problem to it.
Some of these faces had been veteran in the Vietnam.
it is enter this way, to die there.
The blacks not even would have to be fighting this war.
Perhaps he is as Mohamed says There.
"None vietcong Called never me, BLACK".
- Amen. - it is this.
Oh!
it does not say that vi this.
It is seeing yes it.
but it does not go to be for much time.
We go to finish with this idiotice.
It is only calmed.
When they turn it to the officers will make with they take off that it.
It leaves these whites to call you "Uncle Johnson"?
Already Tucker is enough.
Idiots as Innis always go to be for there.
He sees if he finds that he goes to leave this cheap one, I I do not find.
Now, we go to pull out this cloth.
This has much of white, Innis.
Debtor.
but, he goes to lower it.
I do not find that you are the indicated man, Tucker
It is having lack of respect with the black men of the unit.
Really?
, I feel very if the blacks think thus.
vocês is being very insolent, lately.
It does not assume what its people house is making when comes back pra?
I find that it is a shame.
All this freedom, believes this?
I find that you who would have to lower the Yankee flag.
It lowers it, Innis, before that it has problems.
Here it will not have problem, Johnson.
now you who come of poor house. it shows something thing.
it catches its garotinhos and if it orders.
To who it is calling garotinho, Innis?
It lowers it.
It stops.
As it says, I come of poor house.
- Will lower I it.
- He is goes to take off it.
I feel boy, was only an accident.
Equal that its stopped weapon pro Darden, certain?
Already it arrives!
The flag, will be lowered.
- It deprives of a support.
- We go Jack.
I catch
- You of the next time. - it is clearly...
The objective is to demarcate and to register Binh Djerang.
It can be that let us have attack NVA this way this night.
It places a nocturnal defense close to the landing zone.
The monitoring rank keeps all appositive all this night.
E has taken them it Binh Djerang per the morning.
We are not denounced the operation leaving this afternoon?
The luggages must believe that they are part of the Alpha Company of the Valley.
a protecting time the village, Minh Lieutenant, its work will be--
My work will be to find and to interrogate the sympathetical of the Vietcong.
I know well my work, Captain.
good, then everything is decided.
It has some question?
I would like to postpone the exit per some days.
We are not certain of being able to control the men.
- Tucker.
- Captain does not interpret me bad,
This man is a good soldier.
He gained a bronze star and one of silver in the first mission.
It is alone that to the times these faces exceed the limit and to retroact it is impossible.
It would like to be able to help them, but the brigade said that is important.
Good, then I find that we will have that to take Tucker and Innis.
This racism is happening for all the parts.
If to take Tucker or somebody more something can happen worse.
They do not make to understand themselves.
Yes, Sir.
It seems that our transport arrived.
They hear, vocês, they are ready?
Soon you to take pra, branquinho.
It is calmed, friend.
Percell, does not play with this garbage.
Because, it is optimum shooter of the squad.
E there, because it does not go with Innis and the too much white confederates?
Because I am here.
I do not think I eat excessively, Tucker.
I was taught to judge a man for what it makes, not for its color.
What it wants?
The noble prize of the Peace?
It looks at, Tucker. you and Innis have more in common of what she thinks.
vocês does not believe everything this, certain?
--
It the same does not put me in bag that this insane person.
They make me favor the same.
Why they do not stop of a time?
It does not have nothing to see with this.
He fixes in the program, granjeiro before he is late excessively.
This is the moment to decide itself that side is.
The moment is now, That we will go in a mission, together.
Carreguem!
Let us be fast!
I want two of these.
- Wants one?
It wants two of this?
- Yes.
I want the ones that make click-clack.
- Welfare certain.
- Well, debtor.
You are welcome.
- He would have to arrange, Jeremiah.
- He is already I am making.
It is hour to form a small brotherhood.
Very well.
Ei!
, Johnson.
What it wants, Innis?
It needs to be friendlier.
It only wanted to lower the weapons.
To make the pazes, and all these other things.
It wants to say to embed the weapons and my knife, certain?
I am speaking of a brotherhood, Johnson, you knows.
Let us finish with everything this of blacks and whites, and let us have equality here.
It looks at, I do not know which its game, certain?
but, I do not go to play.
Game?
Democracy is alone.
We are here for protecting the world of international a communist conspiracy.
e I find we will make that it well, we are always fighting certain?
The actions say strong more than the words.
e you will see some really good ones.
let us smoke cachimbo of the peace.
Debtor, but not tobacco.
I would accept one.
He likes mentolado?
Why not?
We want that all enter in an agreement.
Whites, blacks and yellows.
- Ei, Ei, are calmed!
- Lieutenant.
He calms myself!
That devils finds that it is making?
It relaxes, Sarge.
It does not need to cry for an Asian.
It calls me, Sergeant.
E this is not an Asian, is a soldier who displays its back one here.
As much how much any one.
- It seems that the Yankee speaks.
- Innis attention Listens, and gives.
..sabe it scares what me, Innis.
Are to finish being equal you.
- What he is this?
- He would not understand.
Because he finds that it is the good one, certain?
but, he is not;
I passed all the encircled life of people as you.
e what it has is a syndrome. "syndrome of the white garbage", boy.
e you are badly.
Equality, hã?
I say that we would have to kill, this idiot.
Will make you it?
What has you, Marcus?
It would not spill nor a tear, if to make.
It is speaking of murder.
Me it seems more as a "control of plagues".
I find that it was speaking in self-defense.
The clowns had thought about fighting with you.
Now Innis is trying to blow up cigarettes in its face.
You are not the type of man who would not defend itself.
You know that everything better.
He assumes that he was in Detroit.
E saw these whites to set on fire its house.
They go to leave its family in the street, or worse.
It is?
It imagines, what it would make?
You know what I would make.
If somebody puts with my family does not import me who is.
It would kill it.
It is of that we are speaking, brother.
Of the family.
Very well, Jenkins, is made sure to have always visual field to shoot.
Certain?
Taylor, is well?
I am well, Sergeant.
It is well, well.
Ei, sergeant, I say that, I was slept.
This is its bayonet?
Now, all know that I have a green ribbon in the bayonet
- Johnson, this is its bayonet?
- Yes, Sir.
E the one that finished threaded Innis on the back of.
Now, as it explains this?
I cannot explain.
It cannot keep in its case.
- Nobody it saw it sleeping.
- It saw Nobody me to kill the Innis.
If had I it deceased, I find that he would be fool to leave my bayonet here?
Marvin, turns it to all arguing.
- Lieutenant, we speak of Johnson--
- Taylor, skirt daqui.
- You know that it is not an assassin.
- Taylor
- but, Lieutenant--
- Taylor.
It is not murderous.
He looks at, sees, because to blame he tries me for this?
Curse!
You know the type of soldier that I am, Lieutenant.
Very well, Johnson.
We go to leave daqui in some minutes.
Now, the body and the bayonet come back to the brigade.
I have to say that you, they will go to make a complete inquiry in the CID.
It is everything.
It would be happy in leaving this mission.
My old one said never to abandon the battalion.
Lieutenant, I and you know that Johnson did not make this.
In normal circumstances, he would say that not.
but, this garbage of leaves me to racism with hot blood.
Curse!
Marvin, as consolation, I do not believe that made you it.
Now it is not the moment, Danny.
- but, I only wanted...
- Danny.
As it wants.
Where it goes, Percell?
I look somebody to apunhalar.
Some suggestion?
It finds that this is funny?
a joke?
This team, this war everything this if converted into a joke.
I do not have time of speaking with no white.
It looks at is in its, Tucker.
It takes its time, makes a favor, clarifies me this doubt.
- It does not pressure me.
- I am not pressuring, Tucker it looks at, I I am alone a mountain poor person.
Hardly it saw a black, until I signed up myself in the army.
Then what it finds?
I find that vocês they are with a punhal cravado for much time.
but, because it wants to apunhalar people whom nothing against you does not have?
- Ours.
- We go, Tucker.
It says me.
What it wants branquelo?
A small estória on being poor and to fight with the rats for a bed, to have seen the soul of a poor father to die seeing my mother if to transform... [00:26:44.63]
... in an old one before the 40 years.
To fulfill a mission in the Vietnam, to come back house and to see garbage the same.
it thinks that the world goes to move?
I do not know what I think.
I came back proud of being able to fulfill my duty stops with the Country.
I found that it had found a place in the army.
What it had?
It swims, man, Except whom the rats have perhaps gotten fat.
I can be died here, fighting in this war of white men.
but, to come back toward house, is not optimum for the society.
Therefore it came back toward here.
it is because already I do not know of where I am.
as soon as pardon they me, cannot leave of side, my hatred.
I do not have more nothing to become attached me.
We will have that to be together youngsters.
This Johnson is dangerous.
Johnson optimum is welded of this squad.
He is, neither killed this idiot.
This idiotic one was my friend.
What she is Baker?
A loving one of the blacks?
It does not love the mestizos.
Therefore we are partners.
- Of that vocês side is?
- Not of its, brother.
When to finish with the brothers, certainly will come behind the Latins.
Soon she will be a Jewish Lieutenant, probably the surfistas.
- Well, this is not just.
- Daqui is ordered.
Everything discourages me to this, and I not taste of this.
Then because it is not gone of my area?
Very well people, we go.
We go, walking.
It only wanted that it knew that its brothers are behind you.
Perhaps they can help to find the face that made this with Innis.
You see already you know that, I do not go to take with me this death.
Brother only calms itself.
We do not go to leave to ruin it.
It looks at, makes me a favor, Tucker.
It is only moved away from my life, heard?
Our partner does not thank nothing, man.
Yes, they now are if finding very confident.
- We have that to block this esquina.
- Yes, yes, Horn.
Horn.
Tiger 6, here Brave 2-6.
Exchange.
Received 2-6.
Six, I want that it blocks the east.
We will go to the west and the south.
Exchange.
Understood 2-6, we will go when calling in them.
Well, I want that it is with the first one and the third squadron.
It will make a blockade in the direction West, in we will only go, e we will make some prisoners, - allowing in them.
Care!

These cursed are escaping, go!
For the right!
They surround them, Surround them.!

They hinder, for the left.
Johnson, Wolfe!
Here!
You, for the center!
Taylor, Hull!
There on!
They advance!
It said to advance!
That devils is happening?
It does not see, Sergeant?
Nobody in this unit wants to give the coasts to the others.
To the devil with vocês.

Not, they lower!
they are where they are!
Because?
If to advance kill in them.
I will make with that the lieutenant calls the artillery, curse!
It swims.
We had them and now we do not have nothing.
E where devils were vocês?
I go to say a thing to them.
Envergonha me to have them under my command.
We not only lose the information, we lose the enemy.
E knows more that?
They lie the vocês, fight its private war while these faces die.
If branquelo was looking for instead of crying as baby nothing of this it would have happened.
I assume that you would not have said no word if she was cravado
In first place it would not be donkey to leave me to cravar a prop.
E cravasse if me would not have cried out.
I find that the animals do not feel pain as the truth people.
Its mount of bone of m.
They keep silent!
They only keep silent!
They want to listen what I say?
Or vocês is donkeys?
Because?
Because they are making this?
Because this is the truth.
It truth is not that they do not want to see nothing to leave well.
I did not give reason to complain.
How I go to trust its friends If they go to take Johnson, the judgment?
Johnson will not be victim of an injustice.
E I go to certify itself that it has a judgment just.
Oh, the justice of the white man.
It knows what it is Tucker?
Here it does not have place to espairecer itself.
A time more, and finishes is it for all vocês and all vocês will be judged.
You not yet saw nothing, boy.
Very well, Ron.
It can bring this team of the left?
Morales, takes off its from there bunda
Well, Sergeant, Already I go.
It is a pity that this thing has been lowered.
Good, these rebellious ones go to place in its place.
Where it goes, Allen?
There it are, Sir.
This goes with belongings of the Soldier of First Classroom, Innis.
It knows, I have much respect for the valentia and sulista pride.
But, this finished, Allen.
Now that I am all limpinho I go to rest until tomorrow to the half day.
E I do not want that it disturbs me to nothing.
It would have to take care of of its subjects.
What wants man?
She is the president of the together one, or something?
I am only taking care of of my people.
Well, its mansion is, weak, brother.
It knows when came the war, of that side I placed myself?
Yes, and what it wants of me?
- Ei, Johnson.
- Yes, Sergeant?
It brings its things.
It takes where it?
It needs to know, soldier?
Necessary to know yes.
The brothers are taking care of of the brothers of now in ahead.
We go, Sergeant, you knows that Johnson did not make nothing.
You know so well how much I, Taylor, that I am only fulfilling orders.
If he does not worry, brother we do not go to leave that they put themselves with you.
They do not go.
We go.
Very well.
Marvin, we go to decide everything this and she will come back with the soldiers, where must be.
She does not have to deceive that me, Sergeant.
I am as a rabbit, certain?
They do not have no witness.
She has a weapon, now need a body to shoot.
Specialist Johnson, presenting itself as commanded, Sir.
I feel Johnson, would desire to be able to make something, but I have my orders.
Then, that it happens now?
This night will be in the command rank.
Tomorrow we will make with that the helicopter in the light one until the brigade.
I feel everything this, Johnson.
A time with the CID this will be, is of my hands.
I must follow the procedure.
Yes, Sir.
Lieutenant.
We go in them to join brothers.
We will not make nothing to be itself here and we do not want Johnson, culprit.
What we go to make?
We cannot bring it in return.
I say that we can.
I do not want to be part of this.
What you are this for branquelo?
He is very pra me.
Johnson is a good one welded, and mine better friend.
I do not see because we do not go together to see Captain Wallace.
Yes, as a committee.
It knows, Percell, it is if converting into my liberal favorite white.
First, we form a committee, later we argue the problem per one five years lies put one hundred blacks behind the gratings.
Well, Tucker. thus they are the things.
It would have to leave it in peace, Danny.
We go to decide this we ourselves, is well?
Brothers are with me or not?
We go to be strong black men or they go to be a mount of blacks as the Uncle Tone.
Man, is speaking to face the army of the U.S.A.
I am speaking to defend ours.
I say to bring the brother in return.
I you knowing,
I am with you, but he can be provoking something that we will not be able to manejar.
He looks at the black man always was abandoned, e nobody goes defending in them.
Then better in defending we ourselves.
Brothers if are with me the weapons carreguem.
Possibly they give 20 years to it in Leavenworth.
Twenty years, devils.
It would have to place its back front to one, squad of execution by firing-squad.
It relaxes, Hull, before it has a hemorrhage.
They are the blacks, a mount of them, and are with weapons.
They are come here?
I do not know, perhaps to the command rank.
It seems that a war is not enough for these youngsters, we go.
They listen to branquelos, we want Johnson here it are, now.
The defendant is where he is, Tucker.
You are not the law this way.
The only law that I see this way is a mount of whites.
Now we make the law for the black friends.
If not to leave, will pay the price.
It has advanced, come.
This went to happen more early or late.
In the truth it would prefer to shoot in you, that in the Asians.
For me it is good, boy.
or it will be that first they want that demons the coasts.
It is not with always has been?
Innis, was the only one that they had caught for the coasts.
They hear!
They listen.
The only ones with who go to fight, are the NVA that had left to escape this morning.
Interest for God, who only in seeing vocês, I vomit.
They only give a great migraine to me.
We came to search Johnson in return.
They had come?
Yes, and we go to take it in return.
Well, it has a small problem, Tucker.
Which?
If it wants Johnson, Will have that to pass on me.
You come now?
Not in my squad!
Not in my squad.
Here he is where alive and I will make, what it is necessary to be.
They make this besteira in any another place.
It found something amused in this, son?
It knows, I have the impression that it is if amusing here, or not?
Not Sir, Not Sir
I only want that light this its bad mood daqui.
Taylor, I am disappointed, son.
Much disappointed.
What it has with Johnson?
It is innocent.
They had heard me, is innocent.
Tam, the small one welded made it to ARVN. what the Innis was molesting.
They had found its fingerprints in the bayonet.
Now Goldmand and Wallas are with it.
- Tam?
- Tam, yes the small youngster what Innis gave a cigarette.
They take care of of its lives, gentlemen!
Tucker, I can say a moment to you?
It can say to all the night to me. you are in the command.
He knows, its he finishes mission here, he was impressive really, Tucker.
A medal of honor, two Púrpura Hearts.
I want to say that he is a soldier for work weighed, Tucker.
It pays it with a currency, giving one to me xícara of coffee.
If it will only be cheap coffee, I will give to you.
But, of all the ways, did not come to say this, certain?
It knows what it impresses more me?
This medal that had given to you for saving the woman in the river.
It almost finishes in some deaths.
It not even was of its color.
- This is everything, Sergeant?
- Not, it is not everything.
He is a good soldier, Tucker, one is cursed good one, welded.
The men of respect you to the squad admire, you.
He could be a model for the youngsters who are arriving.
If he can include its squad.
The brigades had formed a new unit LRRP, they had transferred and me to there.
E does not find that its problem finished.
The true storm is in the horizon.

Good evening.
Is it the penthouse?
Yes, ma'am.
Welcome to another edition of...
"Lifestyles of the average and anxious "
We move about the apartment of peter mitchell,
Young architect about town.
It's his late 30's,
Or is it his early 40's...
We'll never know...
Birthday party.
Entranced by the euphoria and ease...
These glamorous people exude!
I think i spy the birthday boy, himself!
How are you, old chum?
You're looking so well, so well.
Over here is his semi-Main squeeze,
Rebecca davidson.
The public wants to know...
What an attractive, successful woman,
Sees in a bozo, like my roommate.
Well, he's uh...
charming and he's sweet.
He's very thoughtful.
He's sort of boyishly handsome, but...
He has got the most amazing... thank you, rebecca!
You're welcome, michael.
So peter, tell me.
Are you and rebecca still exclusive?
Me and rebecca?
We both see other people.
Really?
That's nice to know.
Bye.
Hey, birthday boy.
Hi, adam.
Rebecca's looking sexier than ever.
You two still together?
Yeah, for 5 years now.
Tight as ever.
Ã¢â"¢âª true love ã¢â"¢âª
James!
Whatever happened to the "young rascals"?
They old.
Real old.
One of them's a senator now.
Oh, god, no!
Real old!
Can i talk to you a minute?
I'm not doing commercials, anymore.
No more talking t-Bones, or cowboys with heartburn.
I'm only doing serious stuff.
Hi.
Jack!
Angela... phew!
You look different.
I'm dressed.
That's it!
Gentlemen, i'm in love.
You?
Yeah.
In a generic sense.
Right.
So many women...
So little time.
So, jack...
You're not really going to do this movie in turkey?
Yes, i am.
I leave in a few short hours.
What is it?
"Zalmon the beautician?"
"Zalmon the barbarian."
What about the play in soho you wanted to do?
Excuse me.
You said it was a once in a lifetime opportunity.
You want my inevitably brilliant reviews,
Or next month's rent?
Forget about next month's rent.
Do the play.
That's sweet of you.
You are a very decent man.
I'm a goddamn saint.
"Saint" is a bit much.
Hey, how's it going, baby?
Name's johnny.
Give me five.
I mean, give me three.
Yeah, yeah.
I can't believe you draw "johnny cool."
Coolest cat in the world, right?
No one cooler, baby.
I can't believe it.
It makes me so happy.
What's wrong?
David.
The guy you broke up with?
The good looking one.
Incredibly good looking.
He used to read me "johnny cool" every morning.
Hey, hey.
Poor baby.
Know how to get over a lover?
Dance with a stranger.
David's an incredible dancer.
He studied 3 years with the joffrey ballet.
3 years?
Joffrey ballet?
You guys will get back together.
Could i call him and invite him to the party?
Uh, yeah.
Twins!
There it is!
Yeah!
One of the best clutch shots of all time.
Nobody played better than...
Reed, west, chamberlain, baylor.
I'll run it for you again in slow motion.
People are asking for you.
Let's go mingle.
"Mingle" sounds like something sea lions do before mating.
You are the guest of honor.
They love you.
But these guys need me.
Don't you?
No.
Go on.
Wait, there it is.
Yeah!
The greatest clutch shot in basketball history.
Unarguably.
The best.
Paul, listen.
You are my friend and a great director,
But i'm not doing commercials ever again.
I don't want you to do a commercial.
I need a favor.
All right, shoot.
I'm having a package delivered tomorrow,
But i'm going to san francisco on a shoot.
You're going to shoot in san francisco?
Who are you using?
Len peters.
Didn't you like my last dog food commercial?
That was a classic.
Could i have this package delivered here?
Sure, no problem.
Let me ask you something.
Do you think i'm overexposed?
Overexposed?
No, not at all.
It'll be delivered tomorrow and picked up thursday.
Tomorrow; picked up thursday.
This is a delicate matter.
Don't mention it.
All right.
Ã¢â"¢âª happy birthday, dear peter ã¢â"¢âª
Ã¢â"¢âª happy birthday to you ã¢â"¢âª
Speech!
Speech!
Oh, uh...
First of all,
I want to thank jack and michael and rebecca...
For embarrassing me with this flow of sentiment.
Thanks for coming.
All right.
All right.
i think everybody had a great time.
i sure did.
Why don't you stick around a while?
I thought sentiment made you uncomfortable.
I can handle it,
As long as it's disguised as sex.
Stay tonight.
I can't.
I have to be up at 7 am for a pretrial meeting.
Happy birthday, peter.
Mmmm.
Yeah, right.
It was a great party.
You know, in this light...
You're kind of ugly.
That rut in the middle of your forehead...
Is getting out of hand.
Why does that happen to you?
As soon as you get a woman in your room,
You turn into her brother and solve her problems.
Unlike you, and our sexually insatiable roommate,
I'm a sensitive guy.
I have more on my mind than pronging chicks.
What's a good year for pronging chicks?
The '82 bordeaux works every time.
Thank you very much.
Did somebody die here?
Rebecca left early.
Michael saved another doomed relationship.
Post-Party depression.
I'm out of here tomorrow, for 10 weeks.
What do you say i get rid of cherise,
We hunker down with a bottle of wine and shoot pool?
I got a better idea.
You two hunker down, and i'll...
No, no, no.
Just go have a good time.
Enjoy yourself.
Tough job, but it's gotta be done.
He's unbelievable.
The man is one giant gland.
Jack?
Jack?
he left already, cherise.
I think he took my mousse.
That's our boy.
Thanks, peter.
See you around.
Yeah.
it's me, jack.
I'm at the airport, but i forgot to tell you something.
A package is going to be delivered today.
Some guys will pick it up thursday before noon.
Just put it aside, and don't worry about it.
It's a very delicate matter, so don't tell anybody.
I'll bring you back something from turkey.
Maybe a drumstick.
See you later.
Bye-Bye.
Hi, harry.
Morning, sir.
Michael?
Get out here.
What is it?
Just get out here.
What?
What's going on?
I don't know.
What?
Oh, okay.
Just look in the hall.
Yeah?
Just look out in the hall.
Okay.
That's a baby.
I know it's a baby.
What's it doing there?
It's sleeping.
Who do you suppose it belongs to?
Peter, there's a note.
All right, i'll just play along.
"Dear jack, here is our baby."
Oh, no.
You really don't know anything about this?
I knew this would happen to him sooner or later.
"I can't handle this.
I don't know where to turn."
Right.
"Someday i hope you can both forgive me.
Her name is mary.
Love, sylvia."
Who's sylvia?
You need a secretary to keep track of all his women.
He left a message about a package...
Being delivered today.
He said to put it aside and not worry about it.
He said that about a baby?
He takes procreation a little lightly.
What are we supposed to do?
Pick it up.
You pick it up.
I'm not picking it up!
You found it!
One of us has to pick it up.
It's not going to be me.
I don't know anything about babies.
Neither do i.
We've got to do something.
Be my guest.
It's not my responsibility.
It's not mine, either.
Don't yell at me!
It can't be that difficult.
Just feed it.
It'll shut up.
I don't know what babies eat!
Soft stuff.
We were babies once.
What did we eat?
It couldn't have been very good; i can't remember.
Wait!
Where are you going?
To get baby food.
We can't feed it cake and goat cheese.
What am i supposed to do?
Entertain it.
"Entertain it!"
How do you entertain a baby?
Hey, junior.
Look at my hands.
Look at this.
It's a glass; a prism.
Look at those colors.
This is nice;
expensive.
You don't like that.
How about... oh, look.
It's almost like japanese origami!
It's a bird!
It's a bird!
No, huh?
I'm getting a headache.
You're giving me a headache.
How about this?
A hairy chest!
Like that?
You want one of these?
Excuse me.
Where can i get a jar of baby food?
3rd aisle to the right.
Right.
They gotta be kidding.
what's happening, baby?
How you doing today?
My name is johnny.
That's right, but you can call me mr.
Cool.
What's your name?
Haven't i seen you around the neighborhood?
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?
Why can't you talk?
Come on, kid.
I'm doing my best.
Excuse me.
Is this a good meal for a baby?
That's for toddlers.
What's a toddler?
11/2 to 2 years.
I need something for a baby.
This is your first?
First what?
Baby.
Yeah.
First and last.
No matter how you prepare, you're never ready.
No, you're not.
What an infant eats...
Can you...
Can determine its entire future.
That's fascinating, but all i need is food.
That's all.
What's the best selling brand?
That white can.
This is the best?
No, it's the cheapest.
That's why it sells.
How about this one?
That's good,
But it's got iron in it.
Is that bad?
If your baby's allergic to it.
How do you know if she's allergic?
They throw up all over you.
But they throw up even if they're not allergic.
Some babies can't hold anything down.
What about this one?
That's for older babies.
How old is your baby?
About that old.
You don't know how old your baby is?
Yes i do.
Is she teething?
Teething?
Does she cry all night, chew her fist and drool?
All right, i'll take 3 of these,
And some of these...
Thanks for your time.
You've been a source of great distress.
If she's less than 3 months old,
You've got to sterilize the nipples.
Here it comes.
Hey!
Look!
I'll give you $10 if you stop crying.
$10 bucks, huh?
I'm going to pick you up, now.
There you go, jr.
Is that better?
How about a little walk?
Wait a minute.
Okay.
Hey, how about this?
No, we're not going to keep crying.
No, no, wait.
Ã¢â"¢âª rock-A-Bye baby on the tree top ã¢â"¢âª
Ã¢â"¢âª when the bough breaks na-Na-Na-Na-Na ã¢â"¢âª
Ã¢â"¢âª something like laughing...
Ã¢â"¢âª
Come on!
Where the hell is he?
Milking the cows or something?
Look!
No crying.
Hey wait a minute!
You can drive a guy to drink.
No, not you.
You're a cute little thing.
How about:
Ã¢â"¢âª hush little baby don't you cry ã¢â"¢âª
Ã¢â"¢âª when peter gets home, i'm gonna punch him in the eye ã¢â"¢âª
All right, here we are.
Here we are in my room.
Look around here.
This is nice, huh?
We'll sit down here.
Look!
We're going to watch a little tv.
Yeah, just you and me.
Here you go.
Amuse yourself.
Women are wondering, are they having an orgasm?
men are worried maybe their penis...
Whoa, whoa.
No, you don't want to hear that.
We'll have a nice conversation with uncle peter...
And let him have some fun.
That's a good idea.
Where the hell have you been?
Oh, hi, mrs.
Hathaway.
Oh, what a darling little baby!
Is it yours?
No, it's not mine.
Mr. Mitchell's?
No, someone loaned it to us.
We're watching her for a while.
What's its name?
Its name is uh, uh, sylvia.
No, mary, mary.
We've had a tough morning, and we're tuckered out.
We have to say good-Bye.
Bye-Bye, mrs.
Hathaway.
By the way,
This package just arrived for you downstairs.
All right, great.
Could i hold her?
I don't think so.
I love babies.
Oh, yes.
Tch, tch, tch.
I just love babies.
Unfortunately, mr.
Hathaway and i...
Were never able to have any.
Mr. Hathaway has a low sperm count.
Some guys have all the luck.
Oh, you are a cute little bundle, aren't you?
You do realize she did a doodle?
Yes, you did.
Would you like me to change her?
No, i can do it.
I'm used to it.
Thanks, we've got to go now.
We're gonna say bye-Bye, now.
Bye-Bye.
Bye-Bye-Bye.
If you ever need a baby-Sitter...
All right, thanks.
She's a lovely baby.
Adorable.
This baby hasn't stopped crying.
She did a doodle.
What the hell is that?
Don't tell me.
I don't want to know.
You're gonna know, because she did it.
I had to go 3 places and get 4 kinds of formula.
2 kinds of diapers, bottles, towels, nipples...
You have no idea how much crap kids need.
How old is she?
You want me to check her driver's license?
You can tell how old she is by feeling her teeth.
I'm not feeling her teeth!
I'm tired of holding her.
I can't hold her and make her bottle.
I'll hold her.
You check the teeth.
Come on!
I can't feel anything.
What's that mean?
She doesn't have any teeth!
Neither did gabby hayes, and he was 90.
We'll give her the stuff for newborns...
And hope she's not allergic.
You've no idea what they can be allergic to.
What's that stench?
hold her.
Just hold her.
This is a girl.
Should we be doing this?
Just hold her, so i can get the diaper off.
How could something so small...
Create something so disgusting?
Beats the shit out of me.
Hand me the other diaper.
Oh!
Shouldn't we wash her?
We'll wash her later.
Get me the cotton.
Oh!
Here it is.
Just give me a little cotton.
I don't need a package.
Get me the cotton wipies.
This is disgusting.
It's all over and it's sticky.
We're going to need some kind of cleaning fluid.
How about after-Shave?
Come on, michael, just get a diaper.
Oh!
Do these tapes go in front or back?
How am i supposed to know?
These are way too big!
What size did you get?
They're ultra absorbent.
The more absorbent, the better!
Hold her!
She's going crazy.
I don't want to.
Come on, michael!
You're going to rip it.
I'm not going to rip it.
Yes, you are.
Get me another diaper.
I'll use the tape.
I'll tape it up.
I'm an architect, for christ's sake.
I build 50-Story skyscrapers.
I assemble cities of the future.
I can certainly put together a goddamn diaper.
Take it easy, kid.
There, see?
It's working.
A piece of cake.
Yeah.
Nice job, pete.
The little insect was just waiting...
For that diaper to fall off.
I think we're in trouble.
I'm going to kill jack.
I'm going to kill him.
This is the deal.
Michael.
What?
You're going to have to wash where the poop was.
Come on.
All righty.
You're not getting anything off that way.
There you go.
That's clean.
I'll rinse her.
Rinse her a little bit.
There we go.
This is for moisturizing...
Don't use the baby lotion now.
It says, "prevents chapping."
Just wash her.
I'll put some in just to make sure.
We gotta get some help.
Jack said this is a delicate situation,
That we shouldn't tell anybody.
Can you believe him putting us through hell...
To save his precious reputation?
I'm not doing it, anymore.
Odds.
You're going to have a headache.
Mary, let me have the pen.
I'm later than usual for the deadline.
Come here.
Okay?
Actually, i don't seem to have them after all.
I must have left them at the office.
I'll get them in the morning.
Right.
Your daddy's a dead man.
Rebecca you're...
I came as soon as i could.
Who are you?
This is jan clopatz;
peter mitchell.
How do you do.
Jan is a cellist from hungary.
He's playing at carnegie hall.
What a thrill.
What's the emergency?
Just come with me.
This is the big emergency.
It's a baby.
Why's that the first thing everybody says?
Of course it's a baby.
It's your baby?
It's not mine.
It's jack's.
Jack has a baby?
I realize that tends to negate...
Our belief in a benevolent god.
It doesn't look like jack.
He has more hair.
I'm glad you can joke at a time like this.
She needs to be held.
Babies like to be held.
Where is he?
Jack's in turkey,
Which is where i'd be if my baby was in new york.
We're dying here.
Michael doesn't know about babies.
I don't know about babies.
I've got deadlines hanging all over me.
I've been reading books about babies.
I can't figure it out.
It says, "feed every 2 hours."
It takes me 2 hours to get her to eat.
Does it mean 2 hours from when i start or finish?
I've been feeding her from when i start,
And i'm feeding her all the time.
Which is it?
Why are you asking me?
You're a woman.
That doesn't mean i know about babies.
Rebecca...
Please stay with me, and help me take care of her.
You want me to take care of her?
Yes.
Now?
No, when she graduates from college.
Yes, now.
I can't do that.
Baby take...
very, very much work.
Thanks for telling me.
Is he an idiot savant?
Rebecca, we be late.
Rebecca...
Rebecca, please.
Stay with me.
I have got a date!
Excuse me for cramping your romantic style.
Rebecca, we be late!
You can't be serious about him.
You go out with other people; so do i.
I don't care if you date the whole string section.
Right now, i need you.
I can't be here now.
Oh, she doodled!
Doodled.
Yes, doodled!
Don't babies doodle in hungary?
We're leaving.
Rebecca!
Wait.
Come on, rebecca.
Don't go.
You're a very big boy.
You're very capable.
You'll get through this fine.
I hate the cello!
Don't.
I keep waiting for "candid camera"...
To walk through the door.
What'd you cancel for tonight?
Box seats at shea.
You?
Dinner with cheryl.
Two more days.
Where'd you put the baby powder?
I'll get it.
Why'd you put it there?
We're bathing her in here.
It's just down the hall.
We don't bathe her there.
Maybe we should start, goddamn it!
You're going to clean that up.
What time are they getting here?
Before noon.
Good.
I see my editor about 1 pm.
Did you move my blueprints?
I need them.
Sorry.
I think she did a doodle.
Your turn to change her.
I'll give you $1000 if you'll do it.
Coming.
Does jack holden live here?
Someone asked us to pick up a package.
I love the way everyone calls it a package.
Tell sylvia she's got a lot of nerve dumping her problems...
Sylvia?
We considered calling the cops.
Wait, wait, wait.
... totally disrupted our lives.
We haven't worked or slept.
There's been shit all over the place.
Shit?
What?
The package busted?
Busted?
You could say that.
Did you put the shit back?
No, we had it bronzed for posterity.
Michael.
Her next bottle is in 45 minutes.
It's in the basket.
It's a baby.
You're sharp, aren't you?
20 minutes after eating she gets tired.
Put her to bed.
I'll get the powdered milk.
Right, powdered milk.
Yeah, powdered milk.
We'll take the "powdered milk" and get out of here.
You want us to take the baby?
That was the arrangement.
Are you sure?
You're damn straight.
If you say so.
Let's go.
You won't forget what we said?
No.
She likes to be rocked to sleep; gently.
Gently.
Absolutely.
I can handle it.
Leave your phone number, in case you need advice.
I'll call you.
Do you hear that, peter?
Just listen.
Isn't it wonderful?
Isn't what wonderful?
Quiet.
Peace and quiet.
Something screwy is going on.
I've got a funny feeling.
You've been tense the last 5 days.
It's just your nerves unwinding.
Maybe you're right.
Michael...
What is this?
A package.
When did it get here?
Sunday.
Mrs. Hathaway...
Go to the window.
Stop them.
I'll catch up with them.
You're beautiful.
Want to go for a ride?
Hey, up here!
Where will i put her?
On your lap.
We need a baby car seat.
Put her in the trunk.
You want to ride in the trunk?
Want to go in the trunk?
Umph!
Oh, no.
Oh, my god!
Want to try this?
It's an adventure.
Why do i listen to you?
It's absurd to put a baby in the trunk.
Hey!
Wonderful.
I gave you the wrong package.
I made a terrible mistake.
I gave you the wrong package.
Give me the baby first.
Give me the baby!
You're disturbing the baby.
Give me the baby.
Hey, satch.
This guy's an animal.
I keep him chained and feed him raw meat.
What's going on?
It's roy and trigger.
What's going on?
Nothing, officer.
You putting the kid in the trunk?
No, it's unhealthy and it's illegal, also.
No, he's not, officer.
Let me see your license and registration.
Why?
You're double-Parked, wise guy!
All right.
Wait a minute.
Be gentle.
I'll be right with you.
Come back here!
You, freeze!
I have no intention of moving.
I'm not a criminal.
I'm an architect with a baby, see?
Let me see some i.D.
I don't have any with me.
Up against the car, spread 'em.
My wallet's in my apartment.
You can come up with me.
I'll show you some i.D.,
But i won't spread 'em because i have a baby.
Let's go, architect.
Here we are.
Can i get you a cup of coffee?
No thanks.
I'll just wait here.
I'll just be a second.
Here we go.
I'm coming.
The package those guys came for...
Is full of drugs.
What?
Drugs!
Here.
Coming.
Do something with it.
Like what?
Hide it!
I'm coming.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Remove that from the cover, please.
Sure.
Thank you.
Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
Shhh.
Shhh.
Thanks for coming up, officer.
If there's anything else i can do, let me know.
I was just doing my job.
I'm detective sergeant melkowitz, narcotics.
Officer, you can saddle up now.
I'll handle this.
Aren't you going to ask me in?
Can i get you a cup of coffee; water, beer?
Thanks, i'm fine.
You don't mind me asking a few questions?
No, not at all.
Is that your baby i saw downstairs?
No, it's my roommate jack's.
Who were those 2 men you were talking to?
Friends...
of the mother's.
They were going to take her for a ride.
The baby, not the mother.
They couldn't because the car...
Had no baby seat.
Mind if i have a look at that baby?
I just love little babies.
She's sleeping.
Sounds like she's awake.
Mind if i see her?
She doesn't like strangers.
She may not be decent.
I don't think she'll mind.
There she is, and she's got a friend.
This is my other roommate.
Detective melkowitz;
michael kellam.
Hello.
What a cutie.
Mind if i hold her?
I just love kids.
I'd rather not.
Go ahead.
It won't hurt.
You know how she is around people.
Let him hold her.
He won't hurt her.
He's a police officer.
All right.
Ohhh.
You're a heavy little girl, aren't you?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
She really is heavy, isn't she?
She's a good eater.
Good.
It means she won't grow up to be nervous.
You've got nothing to be nervous about, sweetie.
She's ready for a change.
Oh!
You know babies;
eat, sleep, and poop.
- I'll change her.
- Good idea.
What a cute little baby.
Do you know where her father is?
No.
He's on location doing a tv movie,
But i have no idea where.
Do you know this guy?
Not very well.
He's a friend of jack's.
I don't remember his name.
He's paul milner.
He directs tv commercials.
On the side, he dabbles in heroin smuggling.
Really?
Yeah.
I don't know him.
I'd appreciate that glass of water now.
Of course.
No problem.
Thank you.
I've got it.
hi, this is peter, michael, and jack.
We're out playing.
Shit!
Whoever it is, i'm here.
Peter?
Jack.
How are you?
I got a message that you were trying to reach me.
Michael and i really have to talk to you,
But you called us at a bad time.
We'll call back later.
I'm calling from turkey.
It took me an hour to get through.
It's not an easy place to phone from.
This place is amazing.
You will not believe the stuff i bought for you.
This shit is so cheap here.
I probably bought too much, but i can always smuggle it in.
Ha, ha.
I was kidding.
Thanks for calling.
We'll see you when you get back.
Oh!
I gotta get him a glass of water,
So his mouth isn't dry when he reads me my rights.
Here you are, sergeant.
Good-Bye.
Nice talking to you.
It was very illuminating.
He heard the phone call.
We're dead.
You think jack's involved?
I don't know.
We gotta talk to paul milner.
Why?
He is involved.
Couldn't you think of somewhere better to hide the drugs?
It was perfect until you insisted that he hold the baby.
I'm sorry.
Where'd you put 'em now?
In the garbage pail under the dirty diapers.
Nobody's gonna look for it there.
You realize we're in trouble with this cop?
You realize that no one's coming back for this kid?
Jesus, you're right.
We're stuck with her 'til jack gets back.
This is disconnected.
Oh, i'm late.
Wait a minute.
So am i.
Oh, damn it.
Mr. Kellam?
Mr. Mitchell?
Hello, mrs.
Hathaway.
It seems that a horse...
Has befouled the front walk.
Do you know anything about it?
Mrs. Hathaway, how nice to see you.
Really nice to see you.
oh.
She can sit 'til 5 p.M. I'll hurry.
Me, too.
I'm worried.
I got the one with the moustache.
I'll tell melkowitz we're moving.
There.
There you go, pal.
What can i do for ya?
I'd like "sports illustrated", "popular science,"
Some gum and that giraffe up there.
Which one's the giraffe?
The rubber one.
That's not a giraffe, that's a dinosaur.
Whatever.
The one with the polka dots?
Yeah, that's it.
That's a dinosaur, not a giraffe.
I don't care.
Just gimme the damn thing.
What about your change?
Never mind.
Mrs. Hathaway, i'm home.
Mrs. Hathaway!
Mrs. Hathaway, where's mary?
I don't know.
Mary?
Oh.
My god.
Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
thank god.
Thank god.
No, everything's fine, darling.
Everything's fine.
Don't you worry.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
No, it's okay.
Peter!
Peter!
She's okay.
She's not hurt.
How are you?
I'm fine, just fine.
Did you see what those bastards did to my videotapes?
We got a message.
What'd it say?
"Next time, we'll take the baby."
It's okay.
It's okay.
Mr. Kellam?
Mr. Mitchell?
"The champ caught smith with a savage left hook...
"That sent the challenger crashing into the ropes.
"Smith, his left eye swollen,
"And the cut above his right eye now much more bloody,
Countered with a barrage of vicious body blows."
What are you reading her?
It doesn't matter what i read,
It's the tone you use.
She doesn't understand the words, anyway.
Now, where were we?
"The champ began the 5th round like a man possessed,
"Going straight for his opponent's body...
With ferocious energy."
Ooohhh!
Bang!
Jeez!
My face!
Watch out for my face!
Peter!
It's me, jack!
Jack!
Jesus, jack!
Jack!
No, wait.
Get him off me.
You irresponsible...
What is it with you guys!
We should be asking you that question.
What'd i do?
What the hell are you doing back so soon anyway?
- My part got cut, okay?
- Good!
What is with him?
Look at this place.
What the hell is going on around here?
Aw, shit!
What was that?
I'm not going anywhere...
'Til you tell me what's going on.
We'll be glad to.
That really hurt, peter.
Ow, ow, ow.
Sunday morning, i come back from jogging...
To find this basket, with this baby in it...
Waiting in the vestibule.
Wha..., What?
Inside is a note from sylvia saying the baby was yours,
And she was leaving it here for you to deal with.
Mine?
Then, along comes another package with your name on it.
Only this time, the package has heroin in it,
And the narcotics squad, camped downstairs, knows all about it.
The cops?
I don't believe this.
I don't know anything about any drugs or any police.
I thought i was just doing a favor for paul.
I didn't know what was in that package.
I certainly don't know anything about that baby.
Somebody drops a baby off, and you assume he's mine?
The child doesn't look anything like me.
I'm bigger...
And i have more hair.
"Dear jack, here's our baby.
I can't handle this now.
I don't know where else to turn."
"Sylvia."
Oh, my god!
Stratford.
A year and a half ago...
I was doing "taming of the shrew."
She was the shrew.
I did some of my best work in that.
I got great reviews.
Jack, you're such a jerk.
You're always thinking about yourself.
I want to kill you.
Michael, we won't have to.
Jack, i would like to introduce you to your daughter, mary.
Wait a minute.
You can't be sure this is my kid.
Uh, uh...
What the hell am i supposed to do with it?
We've put our lives on hold, jack, taking care of this kid.
Now, it's your turn.
Okay, all right.
Fine.
Until i straighten this mess out,
I'll take care of her.
Why not?
I'm an actor.
I can do a father.
Yeah.
What can be so difficult?
Good night, jack.
Good night.
Oh, down we go.
Wait a minute!
What's the matter with her?
Good night, jack.
Good night, jack.
Hold still, kid.
Jeez.
How do you put on these goddamn things, anyway?
Figure it out for yourself, dickhead.
Nice shot.
Look at that stuff!
Oh, my god.
What are you guys feeding her, huh?
Oh, no, not on the silk sheets!
Not on the silk sheets!
Maybe i should show him how to put on the diaper.
Oh, no.
I don't believe this.
Why me?
Please!
Come on, baby!
Nope.
Let's give him another half hour.
Let him suffer.
yes, yes.
I'm trying to reach paul milner.
No, he was supposed to be in san francisco, but i can't find him.
Please tell him to call jack holden as soon as he gets in.
Is this urgent?
Yeah, "urgent's" an understatement...
Lady.
I don't know why i bother to give you this.
It just goes right through you.
Did you get hold of your friend?
No.
Don't forget to bolt the door.
I won't.
Remember, there's $250,000 in heroin in that diaper pail.
The baby wipes are in the cabinet.
Right.
Heroin's in the diaper pail,
Baby wipes are in the cabinet.
Where else would they be?
I can't believe this.
You're kidding me?
Thirty-Two benningtons in the london area?
Yes, sir.
Uh, i'll get back to you.
I, i...
Oh, boy.
I know, i know.
Yes, yes, yes.
Sshh.
Oh, god.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, we tried your mommy.
Maybe i should, uh,
Maybe i should try mine, huh?
Yeah.
Mom!
Well, where is she?
Oh, mom.
Wait 'til you see her.
You won't believe this.
She is so beautiful.
She looks just like you.
You know, you boys live like pigs.
Oh, mom.
Look, there.
Isn't she beautiful?
There she is!
Look at that little baby!
Will you come to me?
I'm gonna pick you right up.
Yes, i'm gonna pick you right up.
Oh, i'm in awe.
I mean, look at you;
You pick her up like a pro.
I pick her up like a grandmother.
that's called experience.
Darling, let's see you.
She's so lovely.
What's her name?
Mary.
Mary!
Well, mary!
Look at the way she's looking at me.
For a moment, there, i had her laughing.
Yeah, just like me, huh?
Don't ruin this for me, jack.
Oh, she adores you.
She knows that you're her grandmother.
It's like a biological thing, an instant connection.
Cut the crap, jack.
What do you want?
Mom, i can't take care of her.
I don't know what to do.
I was hoping that you could take her for a little while,
Not forever.
You know, until she's ready to vote?
Oh, i would love to.
Do you know, jack, some people live all their lives...
Without having anything this wonderful to show for it?
I know, mom.
I'm going to do the most wonderful thing for you;
Absolutely nothing.
Why?
Jack, you've always run away from responsibility.
Now, you have to turn and face it.
Mom...
i'm a screw-Up.
You were a screw-Up.
Now, you're a father,
And you'll be a fine one.
Think so?
I know it.
Your father, god rest his soul, he was a screw-Up,
And he turned out just fine.
Really?
Don't you remember?
Yeah, i guess
Now, give me a kiss.
Mary, give me a kiss.
Now, you and your friends...
Clean this place up.
If not for yourselves, do it for my granddaughter.
We will, we will.
Bye.
Thanks anyway, mom.
Well, looks like it's just you and me now, huh?
what?
Oh, jack?
There's 4 bottles prepared already,
So you should be fine until tomorrow morning.
If her bottom gets red, give her a bottle of water.
In about 3 hours...
white as marble.
We'll be in seats d-11 through 14.
If there's a problem, the usher will get us.
Oh, here's the number.
Wait a minute.
Are you leaving right now?
When are you coming back?
Around midnight.
Don't worry about us.
Is this a four?
Yeah.
it's good to have.
So, uh, what do you want to do?
This show's been running longer than mary's been alive.
Peter, we agreed not to mention her name tonight, right?
Right.
My mistake.
Who did you guys con into sitting for you?
Jack.
Jack?
Daddy?
Wooo...
Are you hungry?
Well, we're in luck here.
tonight, the chef has...
Cooked up something very special for you.
He has taken the juice of one cow,
And sauteed it with a fine sauce.
It is presented, surrounded by a bottle,
And topped off with a delicious rubber nipple, eh?
Excellent choice!
Yes, yes, here we go.
Ah, yes.
what, what?
Here you go.
Come on.
please?
You don't want it, huh?
I just changed you.
Huh?
And you're not hungry.
What else is there in life?
I always wanted to be a musical comedy star.
- Did you ever try?
- No.
ladies and gentlemen,
Act ii will begin in three minutes.
Michael, have you ever done any acting?
No, no, i leave that to jack.
The idiot.
Ã¢â"¢âª i got sunshine ã¢â"¢âª
Ã¢â"¢âª on a cloudy day ã¢â"¢âª
Ã¢â"¢âª when it's cold outside ã¢â"¢âª
Ã¢â"¢âª i got the month of may ã¢â"¢âª
Ã¢â"¢âª i guess you say ã¢â"¢âª
Ã¢â"¢âª what can make me feel this way ã¢â"¢âª
Ã¢â"¢âª my girl ã¢â"¢âª
Maybe he fell asleep, or fell and hit his head.
He's probably unconscious.
Come on, it's started.
- There's an emergency.
- It's terrible.
- I had a great time.
- See you at p.J.'S.
Sing us a song from the 2nd act.
Are they always this strange?
Yes...
Since they got involved with another woman.
Wasn't that fun, huh?
Yes.
Ooh, cover that.
Jack, where are you?
Jack!
I'm right here.
What, what?
What are you doing?
What's it look like i'm doing, peter?
Is everything all right?
Everything's fine, yeah.
Why are you back so soon?
Uh, we thought that we might have left the stove on.
No, no.
The stove's not on.
I think that uncles peter and michael...
Are having a nervous breakdown.
I called, jack.
I let the phone ring for 5 minutes.
Why didn't you answer the phone?
Well, because mary and i were taking a shower,
Weren't we?
We didn't hear anything.
Isn't that the truth, mademoiselle?
Oh, you are cute.
I never put a phone in a shower before.
Do you get many calls in here?
A steady stream.
Here.
"Commercial director hospitalized after mugging."
Yeah, take a look at this.
It's your friend, paul milner.
"Don't let this happen to you.
Be at the phone booth...
At the corner of 81st and columbus at 8 pm tonight."
They're trying to intimidate us.
I hate that.
I've had enough of this doo-Doo!
I want to finish this, okay?
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa.
Hello?
Yeah, we got your message.
Uh-Uh.
No good.
We do it our way.
Because we got the stuff, and if you don't do it our way...
Come on!
Say it, say it.
We flush it down the toilet!
Okay, now.
Listen, and listen good.
There's a construction site...
Car 20 following suspects, south bound, central park west.
Come on, peter!
Damn it, joe, we lost them!
I've got 3 blocks to turn around!
That was great.
That was great.
Everybody remember what they're supposed to do?
Come on, peter.
It's not that complicated a plan.
Next, he'll want us to synchronize our watches.
Should we do that?
Yes, thank you.
Hello, sergeant melkowitz.
My name is jack holden.
I think you know my 2 roommates.
I must have been crazy to agree with that guy.
"Orange elevator." Here it is.
"Close door."
Okay.
15, please.
15?
I'm all filthy.
What's wrong, sweetheart?
Come here.
What is it, huh?
Well, you should have told me before we left.
Oh, boy.
This is not a good time to do this.
Hold still.
There you go.
Michael!
They're here.
You know, this is really aggravating.
I'm here, by the pipes.
I don't have a lot of time...
Hold it, just hold it.
Look, where is the stuff?
Give it to me.
It's in the elevator.
Oh, bullshit!
It's in the control panel.
Check for yourself.
What am i supposed to do, bring my handy tool kit here?
You realize...
We had absolutely nothing to do with this.
We had no idea what was in the package.
I could've figured that out in 4 seconds.
I mean, you guys don't behave like pros.
Right!
We're not pros.
I just said that, didn't i?
Why make it so complicated?
We've never done this.
I've got it!
Great.
You're forgiven, this time.
Very wise of you to cooperate.
Glad it's over.
No happier than i am, believe me.
Dealing with amateurs is a real pain in the ass.
So is dealing with professionals.
No doubt.
Hey, what is that?
What are you, abusing my trust here?
Whoa!
There's someone in there!
Come on!
Come on, michael!
Oh, no.
Look out!
I lost my balance.
You all right?
Did you get it?
Yeah, i got it!
Who's doing this?
I want that camera, punk!
There's 6 switches!
Aw, these guys wrecked my day!
Jack!
What the hell happened?
He hit the wrong button.
He what?
- Can it go any faster?
- This is it!
You punks!
Jack!
Jack!
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.
I want that home movie.
I'll wait for you... i want it!
Oh, no.
Jack!
Hit the button on the left!
The one on the left, jack!
What, what?
Hit the button on the left!
There is no left.
Come on, get it going faster!
I can't!
please...
What's the matter?
Why is this elevator stopped?
I got 'em!
- What's going on?
- It just ain't running'.
- Did you hit the buttons?
- Yeah.
It's dead.
Uncles peter and michael will be plenty ticked off with daddy.
Aren't you glad he's on our side?
You wait for me!
I know where you live!
Oh, no, vince.
Why is this happening?
Why is this happening?
Why?
It's okay, guys, it's okay.
Hi.
Are you sergeant melkowitz?
Yeah.
Are you the father?
Yes, yes, i am.
Thanks for the phone call.
It was peter's idea.
She's okay.
The guys you want are in that elevator.
The drugs are up there, too.
All you need to know is here.
It's very illuminating.
Thanks a lot.
If i have any questions,
I know where to reach you guys.
Can i hold the baby?
No.
Uh, i guess not.
Ã¢â"¢âª when the sun goes down ã¢â"¢âª
Ã¢â"¢âª and it's getting late ã¢â"¢âª

I didn't know you sang so well.
Well, it kind of helps her sleep.
This is having quite an effect on you.
You gonna have any more kids?
I don't want to talk about it, rebecca.
Good night.
Peter, i'm having a lot of trouble sleeping.
Could you sing to me?
Ã¢â"¢âª do-Do-Dee-Do-Do ã¢â"¢âª
All right, i'll see you later.
Thank you.
Great.
Good morning.
Hello.
There you go.
Yes?
I'm sylvia...
Mary's mother.
I've come to get her.
Just a minute.
How is she?
She's fine.
She's teething.
That can be rough.
Can i see her?
Sure.
Come on in.
I don't believe how wonderful she looks!
Oh!
Hello, mary!
Hello, my darling.
It's your mommy.
Yes, it's your mommy.
You're very beautiful.
Your hair is growing.
You've changed so much,
And i've missed it.
Mommy has missed you.
Oh, i never thought i'd miss her this much.
Hello!
Hello!
Where's my baby?
Is jack here?
I'll get him.
Mary, look how big you've gotten!
Ah!
Michael.
Michael.
Sylvia's here.
Mary's leaving.
She looks very happy, jack.
You've obviously taken good care of her.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have left her the way i did.
I hope it didn't cause too much trouble.
No, no.
No trouble at all
Sylvia...
There's something i need to know.
Is she really mine?
Yes, she is.
So, what are you going to do now?
Do you have any idea?
I, uh...
i'm going home.
I can't work and take care of mary on my own, so uh...
We're going to move in with my family.
They said they'd help.
You're going to london?
Yeah.
When?
Tonight.
Is that what you really want to do?
Sorry?
Never mind.
You pack all the bottles?
Yeah.
And the cans of formula?
You packed 'em.
Yeah.
What about the blender?
Should we give her that, to mash up bananas and stuff?
Sure.
And diapers.
You pack extra pampers?
Yeah.
How can he let her go?
If i were jack, i would not let her go.
Neither would i, michael, neither would i.
But he's the father.
I don't think he wants her to go.
But he just can't admit it.
You know, if you want anything at all, you call us.
She'll probably be hungry in an hour.
She's a real good eater, so...
Like her daddy.
Some of this stuff's fragile.
I got it.
If she wakes up at night, she likes to be sung to.
50's and 60's music works best.
I'll remember that.
You're all set.
Everything's packed.
If you need anything else, call us.
Anything.
Okay?
Thank you.
Well, here, let me.
Go ahead.
There we go.
Gloucester hotel, please.
I'll write and let you know how we're doing.
Look, darling.
Wave goodbye, sweetheart.
Bye, mary.
Bye, mary.

Guys like us shouldn't be raising kids, anyway.
Right?
Well, should we?
I suppose not.
She's better off with her mother.
And we are definitely better off...
Now that everything's back to normal.
Right?
Whatever you say, jack.
Right.
So how come i feel so bad?
What'd you say?
How come i feel so bad?
I have this ache, right here.
I don't know.
What do you think, mike?
Could be the wine.
It's not the wine.
Well, what is it, then?
I don't know.
I wish it would go away.
Maybe it's something you ate.
Maybe you're not getting enough sleep.
It's not that.
Then what the hell is it?
I miss mary.
Okay?
I miss mary.
I just wish there was something i could do.
Well, maybe there is.
What?
When's her flight leaving?
Yo, taxi!
Taxi!
Kennedy airport.
Who are you guys chasing?
My baby girl.
Her mother's taking her to london.
How old?
7 months.
7 months.
That's hard work.
Pretty soon, they start to walk.
The first time you hear the word "daddy,"
Your heart just melts.
Can you drive a little faster, please?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Good luck, guys.
It's four, gate four!
Excuse me, sir.
Hold it, fellows.
One at a time.
Hold it.
Any metal?
Put it in here, please.
Go through.
Thank you, sir, one at a time... 1, 2, 3, 4!
Miss, flight 176?
That's it.
Thank you.
Good night.
Sylvia.
Are you all right?
We thought you'd gone.
I couldn't go, jack.
I couldn't do it.
I don't want to make another mistake.
I knew if i took her, i'd be making another mistake.
I have to work...
And i can't do that and take care of mary alone.
Do you know what's it's like?
A one-Room flat, on your feet all day,
Working or auditioning.
I'm on the job sometimes until 3 in the morning.
Since mary gets up at 5:30, i don't get much sleep.
And after 5:30, it starts over at 9:00.
By the time i change her and play with her, it's 8:00.
Forget about sleep after that.
With baby-Sitters, all my money is sucked down the tubes.
And me so tired, i can't take mary to the park.
Getting time for the park is a bitch!
I mean, i love my job but,
I sometimes feel like i'm just working to pay the sitters...
And i run around all day,
And i don't get enough sleep.
I don't think i'm taking very good care of mary.
- Of course you are.
- I am?
We know how hard it is.
The 3 of us could hardly manage.
I don't want to go to london.
I want to work in new york.
But i can't do that alone.
I hope i don't have to.
I need help.
I need someone to help me.
We'll help.
We will help!
You can leave her anytime you want.
When you go for an audition or shopping,
Or you want to be by yourself.
I hoped you'd say that.
Really?
Thank you, so much!
Of course!
Hold it, guys.
I don't like this arrangement.
I just don't want to be mary's baby-Sitter.
I want...
We want to be able to see her all the time.
I agree, so what are you saying?
What do you mean?
I'm saying, that i think,
Mary should move in with us permanently,
That we should be her family.
It's lovely of you to offer...
but i couldn't let mary...
No, no, no, no...
You're right.
She's your daughter.
She needs a full-Time mother.
That's why...
We think that you should move in, too.
It's a great idea!
Yeah!
Oh sylvia, come on.
4 is better than 3.
Uh, do you have room?
I'll build you and mary rooms.
Yeah, he builds rooms!
Please say yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Ã¢â"¢âª something happened baby, in my life ã¢â"¢âª
Ã¢â"¢âª the minute i saw you ã¢â"¢âª
Ã¢â"¢âª all the others faded from my life ã¢â"¢âª
Ã¢â"¢âª the minute i saw you, hey!
Ã¢â"¢âª
Ã¢â"¢âª nothing better baby, in my life ã¢â"¢âª
Ã¢â"¢âª 'til the minute i saw you ã¢â"¢âª

- Good evening.
- Is this the penthouse?
- Yes, ma'am.
- On the roof.
Welcome to another edition of Lifestyles of the Average and Anxious.
We move about the apartment of Peter Mitchell... young architect about town.
It's his late 30s-
- Or is it his early 40s?
We'll never know- birthday party!
- Hi!
Entranced by the euphoria and ease... these glamourous people exude...
I think I spy the birthday boy himself.
Peter!
How are you, old chum?
You're looking so well, so well.
Over here is his semi-main squeeze, Rebecca Davidson.
The public wants to know what an attractive, witty, successful woman sees... in a bozo like my roommate.
Well, he's, um, he's charming and he's sweet.
He's very thoughtful.
He's sort of boyishly handsome.
But he has got the most amazing--
- Thank you, Rebecca.
- You're welcome, Michael.
So, Peter, tell me, are you and Rebecca still exclusive?
Hmm?
- Me and Rebecca?
- Yeah.
- No, we both see other people.
- Oh, really?
Oh.
- Yeah, a lot.
- Oh, that's nice to know.
- Bye, Vanessa.
- Bye.
- Hey, uh, birthday boy.
- Oh, hi, Adam.
- Rebecca's looking sexier than ever.
- Yeah.
- You two, uh, still together?
- Oh, yeah.
Me and Rebecca for five years now.
- Tight.
Tight as ever.
Excuse me.
- Cool.
- Good lovin'
- Gimme that good, good lovin'
- Good lovin'
-All I need is good lovin'
- Good lovin'
-James!
- Yeah, baby.
- Remember the Young Rascals?
What happened to them?
- Man, they old.
- No, don't say that.
- Real old.
- I think one of them's a senator now.
- No, God, no, no!
- A real old senator!
-Jack.Jack. Can I talk to you for a minute?
Paul, I'm serious.
I'm not doing commercials any more.
Really.
No more talking T-bones or cowboys with heartburn.
I'm only doing serious stuff now.
- Hi.
How are ya?
- Oh,Jack.
Whew!
Angela.
Whew, boy, you look different.
What happened?
- I'm dressed.
- That's it.
That's it.
Everybody gather 'round now
Move your body to the beat
Gentlemen, I'm in love.
- You?
- Yeah.
In a generic sense.
- Right.
Right.
- Oh, my.
Oh.
- So many women--
- And so little time.
So little time, yeah.
- So,Jack.
- Yeah, what's up?
- You're not really gonna do this movie in Turkey, are ya?
- Yes.
Yes, I am.
As a matter of fact, I leave in a few short hours.
Here.
- What is it, uh, Zalmon the Beautician?
- Barbarian.
Zalmon the Barbarian.
I knew you were gonna say that.
Okay, well, what about the play in Soho?
The one you said you wanted to do.
- You said it was a chance to--
- Uh, excuse me, please.
Excuse me.
You said it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
- Hi.
- Oh, come on.
What d-
- What do you want, my inevitably brilliant reviews, or, uh, next month's rent?
Forget about next month's rent.
I'll cover you, you do the play.
That's sweet of you.
You know, you are a very decent man, Peter.
- I'm a goddamned saint.
- "Saint" is a little bit much, but--
Hey, how's it goin', baby?
Name's Johnny.
Gimme five.
Ooh, I mean, gimme three.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can't believe you draw Johnny Cool.
Coolest cat in the world, right?
No one cooler, baby.
I can't believe it.
Makes me so happy.
- What's wrong?
- It's David.
- The guy you broke up with?
- The good-looking one.
Incredibly good-looking.
He used to read me Johnny Cool every morning over breakfast.
Hey.
Hey, hey.
Oh, you poor baby.
You know how to get over a lover, hmm?
Dance with a stranger.
David's an incredible dancer.
He studied for three years with the Joffrey Ballet.
Three years?
Joffrey Ballet?
I think you guys are gonna get back together.
You think that I could call him up and invite him to the party?
Uh, yeah, uh--
Come on, shake your body Baby, do that conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the beat It's getting stronger
Don't you fight it till you try to do that conga beat
Twins!
There it is.
Yeah!
Arguably one of the best clutch shots of all time.
Forget the guys playing today.
Nobody played this game better than Reed, West, Chamberlain, Baylor.
I'll run it for you again in slow motion.
People are asking for you.
Come on, let's go mingle.
I hate that word.
It sounds like something sea lions do before they mate.
You are the guest of honour, and they love you.
Of course they do, but these guys need me in here.
Don't you need me in here, guys?
- Go on, get outta here.
- Leave your money.
- Yeah, we need that.
- Wait, there it is.
- Yeah!
- Undoubtedly, the greatest clutch shot in basketball history.
- ...clutch shot in basketball...
- Unarguably.
- In slow motion.
The best.
Oh, Paul, Paul.
Wait, wait.
Listen to me, man.
You are my friend.
You're a great director.
But I am not doing commercials ever again.
I mean it.
Jack, I don't want you to do a commercial.
I need a favour.
Oh.
Yeah, all right, shoot.
What?
I'm having a package delivered tomorrow, but I won't be home to get it.
I gotta go off to San Francisco all week on a commercial shoot.
- You're gonna shoot in San Francisco?
- Yeah.
- Who are you using?
- Oh, Len Peters.
Lenny.
Lenny.
What's wrong?
Didn't you like my last dog food commercial?
Oh,Jack, that was a classic.
But now look, I was hoping that I could have this package delivered here instead.
Sure, no problem.
No problem.
Listen, let me ask you something here.
- Do you think I'm overexposed?
- Overexposed?
Oh, no,Jack, not at all.
Now look, it'll be delivered tomorrow and picked up by a couple of guys on Thursday morning.
- That's all there is to it.
- All right.
Tomorrow, pick up Thursday.
Okay, but this is-- this is a very delicate matter,Jack, so don't mention it to anybody, all right?
- All right, yeah.
Delicate.
- Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Peter
Happy birthday to you
He's so shy.
- Speech!
Speech!
- Oh, look, um--
First of all, um, uh...
I wanna thank, uh, Jack and Michael and Rebecca... for, uh, embarrassing me with this unending flow of sentiment.
- Oh!
- I, uh--
- Thanks for coming.
- Hey, all right!
All right!
- Go on!
Blow out the candles!
Quick!
- Whoa!
Whoa!
I think everybody had a great time.
Don't you?
I sure did.
Why don't you stick around a while?
I thought sentiment made you uncomfortable.
- I can handle it...
- Mm-hmm.
as long as it's disguised as sex.
So stay tonight.
I can't.
- I have to be up at 7:00 for a pretrial meeting.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
Happy birthday, Peter.
Mmm.
Yeah, right.
It was a great party.
You know, in this light you're kinda ugly.
Yeah.
Yeah, that rut in the middle of your forehead?
Gettin' out of hand.
Out of hand.
- How come that always happens to you?
- What?
Well, as soon as you get a woman into your room... you turn into her big brother and start solving her problems.
Well, unlike yourself and our sexually insatiable roommate...
I happen to be a sensitive guy, and I have more on my mind than simply pronging chicks.
Hey, guys.
Say, what's a good year for pronging chicks?
The '82 bordeaux on the left works every time.
Thank you very much.
- What happened here?
Somebody die?
- Rebecca left early.
- Oh.
- Michael saved another doomed relationship.
Post-party depression.
Listen, you guys, you know, I'm outta here tomorrow for ten weeks.
What do you say I get rid of Cherise--
No, no, the three of us hunker down here with a bottle of wine and shoot some pool.
I got a better idea.
Why don't you two guys hunker down, shoot some pool, and I'll, uh, take--
- No, no, no.
- Why don't you just go and have a good time?
- Yeah, enjoy yourself.
- Oh, guys.
Tough job, but it's gotta be done.
Oh.
- He's unbelievable.
- The man is one giant gland.
-Jack.
- Seventy-nine.
-Jack!
- He left already, Cherise.
Eighty.
- Hi, this is Peter, Michael and Jack.
- Great.
I think he took my mousse.
- We're out playing and can't come to the phone.
- That's our boy.
Eighty-two.
- We'll call you back as soon as we can.
- So leave a message at the sound of the tone.
- Thanks, Peter.
See you around.
Yeah.
Eighty-four.
Hi, it's me, Jack.
Uh, I'm at the airport just about to board the plane.
But I forgot to tell you something.
There's a package gonna be delivered today.
Uh, some guys'll pick it up Thursday before noon.
Just put it aside, don't worry about it.
And, oh, wait a minute.
It's, uh, it's a very delicate matter, so don't, don't say anything to anybody.
Okay?
I'll bring you guys something back from Turkey if you're good.
Maybe a drumstick or somethin'.
- See you later.
Bye-bye.
- Ninety.
- Hi, Harry.
- Good morning, sir.
Michael!
Michael, get out here!
- What is it?
-Just get out here.
What?
- What's goin' on?
- I don't know.
What's goin' on?
Oh, okay.
Just look out in the hall.
- Yeah?
-Just look out in the hall.
Okay.
- That's a baby.
- Oh, I know it's a baby.
- What's it doing there?
- It's sleeping.
Oh, okay.
Who do you suppose it belongs to?
Oh, Peter, there's a little note.
All right, I'll just go in and... okay, play along.
"Dear Jack, here is our baby--"
Oh, no.
- You really don't know anything about this?
- I knew it.
I knew it.
I knew this was gonna happen to him sooner or later.
- "I can't handle this now.
I don't know where else to turn.
- Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Right.
- "Someday I hope you can both forgive me.
- Unbelievable.
Her name is Mary.
Love, Sylvia." Who's Sylvia?
How am I supposed to know?
You have to be a social secretary to keep track of all his women.
He left a message about a package.
He said it'd be delivered today.
He said to put it aside and not to worry about it.
- He said that about a baby?
- I'd say he takes his procreation business a little lightly.
- So what are we supposed to do about this?
- We pick it up.
- You pick it up.
- I'm not picking it up.
You found it!
- Look, we gotta do something.
One of us has to pick it up.
- Well, it's not gonna be me!
Now what?
I don't know anything about taking care of babies.
Well, neither do I!
- Look, we gotta do something!
- Be my guest.
- Hey, it's not my responsibility.
- It's not mine either!
- Don't yell at me, Peter.
- Well, it can't be that difficult.
All we gotta do is, is feed it.
It'll shut up.
- Well, I don't know what babies eat.
- Soft stuff.
I mean, we were babies once, for God's sake.
What did-
- What did we eat?
I don't know.
It couldn't have been very good.
I can't remember.
- Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Where you goin'?
- I'm going to the market to get some baby food.
We can't feed it birthday cake and goat cheese.
- So what am I supposed to do?
- Entertain it.
"Entertain it."
Entertain it?
How do you entertain a baby?
Hey, junior.
Hey, look.
L-Look at my hands.
Hey.
Hey.
Look at this.
Look at this.
Oh, it's a-- it's a gla-- it's a prism.
Whoa.
Look at those colours, huh?
This is nice stuff, huh?
This is expensive.
You don't like that, huh?
Well, how about, uh-
- Oh!
Ooh, look!
It's almost like, uh--
Look,Japanese origami, almost, with the hands.
It's a bird!
It's a bird!
No, huh?
Uh-
- Uh-
- I'm gettin' a headache.
You're givin' me a headache.
Uh, how about, uh-- how about this?
How about this?
Look at this.
Look at the hairy chest.
You like that?
You like that?
You wanna-
- You want one of these?
Price check!
Excuse me.
Uh, where could I get a jar of baby food?
- Uh, third aisle to the right.
- Right.
-Joe, I need a cheque okay on three.
- It's the larger size?
- Got it.
- This is cheaper.
- Oh.
They gotta be kidding.
What's happenin', baby?
How you doin' today, huh?
My name is Johnny.
That's right.
That's right.
But you can call me Mr Cool.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Hey, wh-what's your name, huh?
Huh?
Haven't I seen you around the neighbourhood?
Come on, baby, wh-
- Wait, what's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?
Why can't you talk?
Huh?
Huh?
Come on, kid, laugh it up.
I'm doin' my best.
Mr Foley, I need a cheque okay on two.
Excuse me.
Uh, is this a good meal for a baby?
- That's for toddlers.
- Toddler?
What's a toddler?
- Ayear and half, two years.
- No, no, I-I need something for a baby.
- This is your first.
- First what?
- Baby.
- Uh, yeah.
First and the last.
- No matter how much you prepare, you're never quite ready for 'em, are you?
- No, you're not.
- Um, listen, could you-
- Can you hel--
- Did you know that what an infant eats in its first 1 2 months... can determine its entire psychological and physical future?
That's fascinating, but all I need is some food.
Just some food, that's all, uh, Edna.
- What's the best-selling brand?
- That white can over there.
- Great.
This is the best, then?
- No, it's the cheapest.
That's why it sells the most.
- Uh-huh.
How about this one, then?
- Oh, that's good.
- Good.
- But it's got iron in it.
- Is that bad?
- It is if your baby's allergic to it.
- How do you know if she's allergic to it?
- They throw up all over you.
Of course, they throw up all over you even if they're not allergic to it too.
Some babies can't hold anything down for more than a minute.
- What about this one?
- That's for older babies.
How old's your baby?
- About that old.
- You don't know how old your baby is?
Yes, I do.
I know-- I know how old my baby is.
- Is she teething?
- Teething?
Well, you know, uh, does she cry all night?
Does she chew on her fist and drool a lot?
All right, okay, then I'll take three of these and I'll take some of these, and thanks very much for your time, Edna.
You've been a source of great stress.
Don't forget, if the baby's less than three months old, you gotta sterilize the nipples.
Aw, shit!
Here I come!
Hey, hey, hey, look, I'll, uh-
- I'll give you ten bucks if you stop crying.
Huh?
Ten bucks.
Huh?
You like that?
Hey, I'm gonna pick you up now, huh?
Here you go, junior.
Here you go.
Is that better?
No, huh?
All right, well, how about, uh, how about a little walk, huh?
How about a little walk?
Here, hey, wait a minute.
Let me-- Let me-
- Here you go.
Here we go.
Okay.
Hey, how 'bout this, huh?
There-
- N-No, no-no, no-no-no.
We're not gonna keep cryin'.
No, no, no, no!
No, no!
Hey, wait a minute.
Oh, look!
Hey!
Rock-a-bye baby On the treetop
When the bough breaks--
Something and something Something--
Come on.
Where the hell is he, milking' the cows or somethin'?
Hey, look.
No, no, no, no, no crying.
No, no, no.
No-
- No crying.
Hey, wait a minute.
Whoa, ooh, no!
You can-
- You can drive a guy to drink.
You know that?
No.
No, not you.
You're a cute little thing.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, wait a minute.
How about-- Hush, little baby, don't you cry
When Peter gets home I'm gonna punch him in the eye-
- Hush.
All right-
- All right, here we are.
Here we are in my room.
Yeah.
Look-
- Look around here.
This is nice, huh?
Uh, uh, maybe you can, uh-- Here, we'll sit down here and, uh--
Oh, look!
Look!
We're gonna watch a little TV.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We'll watch a little TV.
Just you and me, huh?
Here you go.
There you go.
Amuse yourself.
Women are wondering.:
Are they having an orgasm?
- Men are worried maybe their penis isn't--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
No, no, no, no, no, you don't want to hear that.
No, no, no, no, no.
Okay, we're gonna have a nice conversation with Uncle Peter... and let him have some fun now, yeah?
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Where the hell have you been?
- Oh, hi, Mrs Hathaway.
- Mr Kellam, this package just arri--
- Oh, what a darling little baby.
- Yeah.
- Is it yours?
- No, no, no, no.
It's not mine.
- Mr Mitchell's?
- No, no, no, no, no.
Someone sort of loaned it to us.
- W-We're watching her for a while.
- Well, what is its name?
Her name is, uh, it's, uh, Sylvia.
No, Mary.
Mary.
Mary.
Yeah.
Well, we've had a tough morning, and we're all tuckered out.
We've been drooling, so, uh, we're gonna just say goodbye, okay?
- Bye-bye, Mrs Hathaway.
Bye-bye.
Yeah.
- Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Oh, by the way, um, this package just arrived for you downstairs.
Uh, all right, great.
Great.
Th-Thanks, Mrs Hathaway.
- Could I hold her for just a minute?
- Oh, I don't think so.
She doesn't really--
I just love babies.
Oh, yes.
I just love babies.
Unfortunately, Mr Hathaway and I were never able to have any of our own.
- Mr Hathaway has a low sperm count.
- Well, some guys have all the luck.
Oh, oh, you are--
You are a cute little bundle, aren't you?
You do realize she did a doodle.
Yes, you did.
Would you like me to give you a hand in changing her?
No.
No, no, no, I can do it.
I-I-I'm used to it.
I'm used to it.
Well, thanks a lot, Mrs Hathaway.
We gotta go now.
All right?
So, uh, so we're gonna say bye-bye now.
- All right?
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
Bye-bye, Mary.
- Bye-bye.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Okay, bye.
- Little child.
Of course, if you ever need anyone to babysit--
All right.
Yeah?
All right.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
- Mr Mitchell, she's a lovely baby.
- Yeah, adorable.
Where the hell have you been?
This baby hasn't stopped crying since you left, and she did a doodle.
"Doodle"?
What the hell's that?
No, don't tell me.
I don't want to know.
Oh, you're gonna know, pal, 'cause she did it.
What's with all the bags?
I had to go to three different places to buy four different kinds of formula... two different kinds of diapers, bottles, towels, nipples.
You have no idea how much crap these kids need.
- How old is she, anyway?
- How should I know?
You want me to check her driver's licence?
- Feel her teeth.
- What?
-Just feel her teeth.
The druggist said that you can tell how old she is by feeling her teeth.
Well, I'm not feeling her teeth!
You feel her teeth!
I'm tired of holding her, anyway!
Here!
No!
Uh, no, I can't hold her and, and make her bottle at the same time.
All right, I'll hold her, you check for the teeth, okay?
- Come on!
- All right.
- I can't feel anything.
- What do you think that means?
- It means she doesn't have any damn teeth!
- Well, neither did Gabby Hayes, and he was 90!
So what?
All right, then we'll give her the stuff for newborns, hope she's not allergic to it.
You have no idea how much stuff these kids can be allergic to.
What's that stench?
Michael, hold her.
Just hold her.
That's it.
- Wait a minute.
Peter, this is a girl.
Should we be doing this?
- Michael, just hold her, will ya, so I can get the diaper off.
- Ohh!
- Ohh!
How can something so small create so much of something so disgusting?
Oh, God.
Beats the shit out of me.
All right, hand me the other diaper.
There, take--
- Wait a minute.
Shouldn't we wash her first?
- Uh, we'll wash her later.
Just-
- Well, give me the cotton.
Give me the-
- Oh!
How about this?
Come on.
Uh, Michael, I-- Just give me a little cotton.
- I don't need a package.
I just need some cotton.
- All right, here.
Oh, no, wait, g-
- The wipies.
Get me the g-- the, you know, the cotton wipies.
Right.
Here it is.
- All right.
- Ooh, this is disgusting.
It's all over, and it's, it's-- it's sticky and--
We're gonna need some kind of cleaning fluid to get it off.
- How about after-shave?
- Aw, come on, Michael!
Just get me one of the diapers!
All right.
All right, good.
Now, these tape things go in the front or the back?
- Uh, how am I supposed to know?
- Okay.
There.
Whoa!
These diapers are way too big.
- What size did you get, adult?
- They're ultra-absorbent.
The more absorbent the better, if you ask me.
Will you hold her for a minute?
The kid's going crazy.
I--
- I don't want to.
- Come on, Michael!
- Hey, don't pull that so hard.
It's gonna rip.
- I'm not gonna rip it.
Yes, you are.
All right, well, okay, uh, get me another diaper.
I'll use the tape.
I'll use the tape from the diaper, I'll tape it up.
I'm an architect, for Christ's sakes.
I build 50-storey skyscrapers.
I assemble cities of the future.
I can certainly put together a goddam diaper.
Take it easy, kid, all right?
There.
There.
See?
It's working.
Piece of cake.
There.
Yeah.
Nice job, Pete.
The little insect was just waiting for that diaper to fall off.
I think we're in trouble.
I'm gonna kill Jack.
I'm gonna kill him.
- This is the deal.
Yeah, that's it.
- Michael.
- What?
- You're gonna have to wash where the poop was.
- Now, come on.
- All righty.
- Come on.
- I've got that handled.
- No, no, just--
- Perfect.
- You're not getting anything off that way.
There.
There you go.
- That's clean.
Isn't that clean?
- Yeah, right.
- And her-- her privates.
- I'll rinse her.
- All right.
Rinse her out a little bit.
- There we go.
Okay.
This says-- This says "For moisturizing and--"
- Don't use the baby lotion now.
It's lotion.
- Well, it says---
- It says "Prevents chapping and chaffing."
-Just wash the baby.
Well, I should put some in there anyway just to sort of make sure she's not--
Okay.
We gotta get some help.
Jack said this is a delicate situation, that we shouldn't tell anybody.
Can you believe him, putting us through hell to save his precious reputation?
I'm not doing it any more.
Odds.
Willie, they need you over here a minute.
Make a little room.
- Well, at least it ain't raining'.
- You're gonna have a headache.
- Try sleeping' nights, Peter.
Mary, let me have the pen.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm later than usual this week for the deadline.
Come here.
Okay-
- Oh!
Actually, Sam, I-
- I don't seem to have them here after all.
I must have left them at the office, but, uh, I'll get them first thing in the morning.
Right.
Your daddy's a dead man.
- Rebecca, you're--
- Yeah, I came as soon as I got your messages.
What's the emer--
- Who are-
- Who are you?
- Um--
-Jan.
- This is Jan Clopatz.
This is Peter Mitchell.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- How do you do?
Come on.
Jan is a cellist from Hungary.
He's playing with the Brauslau Baroque Ensemble at Carnegie Hall.
- What a thrill.
- Peter, what's the emergency?
Just come with me.
This is the big emergency.
- It's a baby.
- Why is that the first thing everybody says-- "It's a baby"?
Of course it's a baby.
- It's your baby?
- No, it's not my baby.
- It's Jack's baby.
-Jack has a baby?
I realize such a concept tends to negate our belief in a benevolent God, but yes.
Well, it doesn't look like Jack.
Jack's got more hair.
I'm glad you can joke at a time like this.
See?
She needs to be held.
- Babies like to be held.
- Hmm.
- Where is he?
-Jack?
Oh.
Jack's in Turkey, which is where I'd be if my baby was in New York.
Now look, Rebecca, we're dying here.
Michael doesn't know anything about babies.
I don't know anything about babies.
On top of that, I got deadlines hanging all over me.
I've been reading these-- these books about babies.
I can't figure it out.
For instance, it says here-
- Look.
"Feed every two hours." Well, it takes me two hours to get her to eat anything.
So does it mean feed her every two hours from when I start?
- Yeah.
- Or every two hours from when I finish?
Because I've been feeding her every two hours from when I start, and I'm feeding her all the time!
- Mmm.
- So which is it?
- Why are you asking me?
- Because you're a woman.
Yeah.
That doesn't mean I automatically know what to do with babies.
Rebecca, now, pl-- please, uh, stay with me and, and help me take care of her.
- You want me to take care of her.
- Yes.
- Now?
- No, when she graduates from college.
Yes, now.
I can't do that, Peter.
Baby take very, very much work, huh?
Yeah.
Thank you for telling me that,Jan. I didn't know that.
What is he, an idiot savant?
Rebecca, we--we'll be late and--
Uh-
- W--Uh-
- Rebecca, no, now--
Rebecca, please!
Stay with me!
- I have got a date.
- Oh?
Oh, excuse me for cramping your romantic style.
Rebecca, we'll be late, huh?
- Uh, just--
- You can't be serious about this guy.
Oh, come on, Peter.
You go out with other people and so do I. We agreed to that.
You can go out with the whole damn string section for all I care.
That's not the issue.
- Right now I need you here.
- Well, I can't be here now.
- Oh!
She doodled.
- Doodled!
Yes, doodled!
What's the matter?
Don't babies doodle in Hungary?
- We're leaving.
- Uh, Rebecca, no, wait.
Come on, Rebecca, please.
Don't go.
Peter, you're a very big boy, you're very capable... and you're gonna get through this just fine.
I hate the cello.
Don't.
I keep waiting for Candid Camera to walk through the door.
- What did you cancel for tonight?
- Box seats at Shea.
You?
Dinner with Cheryl.
Two more days.
Where'd you put the baby powder?
I'll get it.
What'd you put it out there for?
We're bathing her in here.
You should have brought it in with her bath stuff.
- It's just down the hall.
- Well, we're not bathing her in the hall, are we?
Well, maybe we should start, goddam it!
You're going to clean that up.
- What time are those guys supposed to get here?
-Jack's message said before noon.
Good.
I gotta see my editor about 1 :00.
Michael, did you move my blueprints?
I need 'em for my meeting this afternoon.
Sorry.
I think she did a doodle.
Your turn to change her.
I'll give you a thousand dollars if you'll do it.
Check this out.
What do you know?
Coming!
Coming!
- Does, uh,Jack Holden live here?
- Yeah.
- Someone asked us to pick up a package.
- A package?
I love the way everybody keeps calling it a package.
You can tell Sylvia for us that she's got a lot of nerve dumping her problems in our laps.
- Who's Sylvia?
- When it first got here, we considered calling the cops.
- Hey, w-
- Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait.
No, no, w--
- But we didn't.
We stuck it out, even though it totally disrupted our lives.
No, you wait.
Hey, we haven't been able to work or to sleep.
- And there's been shit all over this place for days.
- "Shit"?
- What?
- You mean the package?
It busted?
Busted?
Yeah.
Yeah, you could say that.
- Well, did you put the shit back?
- Put it back?
No, we had it bronzed for posterity.
What do you think we did?
Michael.
Her next bottle's in 45 minutes.
I made it up already.
It's in the basket.
- It's a baby.
- You're sharp, aren't ya?
He's all right, huh?
Twenty minutes after she eats, she gets tired.
Put her to bed.
- And I'm getting you a can of powdered milk.
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Right.
Powdered milk.
Right.
- Yeah, powdered milk.
So, all right, so we'll take the "powdered milk" and, uh, we'll get out of here.
What, you want us to take the baby?
That was the arrangement.
- Are you sure that's the plan?
- You're damn straight.
Well, if you say so.
Let's go.
- You won't forget what we said?
- No.
And she likes to be rocked to sleep.
Gently.
Gently.
Absolutely.
Gently.
I-I can handle it.
Maybe you should leave a phone number, in case you need some advice.
Oh, uh, I'll call you.
Do you hear that, Peter?
Just listen.
Isn't it wonderful?
- Isn't what wonderful?
- Quiet.
Peace and quiet.
There's something screwy going on, Michael.
I got a funny feeling.
What are you talking about?
You've been tense the last five days.
It's just your nerves unwinding.
Maybe you're right.
Michael.
- Michael, what is this?
- A package.
- When did it get here?
- Sunday.
- Mrs Hathaway br--
- Go to the window.
See if you can stop them.
I gotta try and catch up with them!
Hi.
Hello.
Yeah, you're beautiful.
Come on.
Wanna go for a ride?
Hey!
Hey, up here!
- Where am I gonna put this little baby?
- Right on your lap.
Huh?
No, we need a little baby car seat, I think.
- Put her in the trunk.
- Yeah?
You wanna go for a ride in the car, in the trunk?
Huh?
Wanna go in the trunk?
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
Hey, hey.
You wanna try this?
It's an adventure.
Why am I listening to you?
Why-
- Why do I listen to you?
I mean, this is absurd.
I can't put a little baby in the trunk.
- Hey!
- It's okay.
Yeah.
- Oh, Mr Wonderful.
- Hey!
-Yeah?
-Look, uh, I gave you the wrong package.
- W-W-What wrong package?
What are you talking--
- I made a-
- I made a terrible mistake.
I gave you the wrong package.
Look, I've got-
- Give me the baby first.
- No.
Hey, no-
- Take it easy.
Be gentle.
- Give me the-
- Give me the baby first.
- Give me the baby.
Give me the baby.
- Be gentle.
You're disturbing the baby.
- Hey, hey, hey, what are you, crazy?
- Give me the baby first.
- Look, hey, Satch.
Hey, listen, this guy's an animal.
- Give me the baby!
Please!
I keep him chained to the wall.
I feed him raw meat.
- Hey!
What's goin' on here?
- Oh, God, it's Roy and Trigger.
- I said, what's goin' on here?
- Nothing, Officer.
- You gonna ride with that kid in the trunk?
- No!
Of course not.
That's absurd.
I mean, it's unhealthy for the child, and it's illegal also, I understand.
- No, he's not, Officer.
Give me the baby.
- Yeah--
- All right, let me see your licence and registration.
- Why?
- Why?
- Yeah, why?
- 'Cause you're double-parked, wise guy!
- Oh.
Why-
- All right.
Wait a minute.
What's--
- Give me the baby.
Just be gentle.
Be gentle.
Be gentle.
- Hey.
Stay there.
- One second, Officer.
I'll be right with you.
Book!
Book!
Book!
Book!
Hey, come back here!
You, freeze!
I have no intention of moving, Officer.
I'm not a criminal, I'm an architect.
- W-With a baby.
See?
- Ah, let me see some I.D.
Oh, yeah, sure.
- I don't have any with me.
- Up against the car.
Spread 'em.
Uh, Officer, look, uh, uh, my wallet's up in my apartment.
It's right up there.
You can come up with me.
You're welcome to.
Uh, uh, I-I'll some you some I.D, but I'm not gonna spread 'em because I have a baby, as you can plainly see.
All right, architect, let's go.
Here we are.
Come on in.
Can I get you a cup of coffee or something?
No, thanks.
I'll just wait here by the door.
Michael!
I'll just be a second.
Come with me, Michael.
Here we go.
I'm coming.
Uh, just listen.
The package those guys came for is full of drugs.
- What?
- Drugs.
All right, here.
- Coming.
Do something with it.
- Like what?
Hide it.
I gotta show him some I.D. I'm coming.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
There you are.
- Would you mind removing that from the cover, please?
- Well, sure.
- Thank you.
Shh, shh.
Shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh.
Shh.
Sure.
Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
Thanks for coming up, Officer.
I hope it hasn't been an inconvenience.
And if there's anything else I can do for you, just let me know.
I was just doin' my job.
Hi.
I'm Detective Sergeant Melkowitz, Narcotics.
Officer, you can go down and saddle up now.
- Yes, sir.
- I'll handle this.
Aren't you gonna ask me in?
Can I, uh, get you a cup of coffee, some water, a beer?
No, no.
No, thanks, I'm fine.
Ah.
- You don't mind me asking a few questions, do you?
- No, not at all.
- Is that your baby I saw you with downstairs?
- No.
Uh, well, um, it's my roommate Jack's.
Well, who were those two men I saw you talking to?
Friends.
Of the mother's.
They were gonna take her for a ride.
The baby!
Baby.
Not the mother.
But they couldn't, see, because they brought the wrong car.
There's no baby seat.
Well, do you mind if I have a look at that baby?
I just love little babies.
She's sleeping.
Sounds like she's awake to me.
Do you mind if I see her?
I don't know.
You know, she doesn't really like strangers.
- She may not be decent.
- Oh, I don't think she'll mind.
Well, there she is.
And she's got a friend.
Oh, yeah, this is my, uh, other roommate.
Uh, Detective Melkowitz, this is Michael Kellam.
- Hello.
- Oh, what a cutie.
Do you mind if I hold her?
I just love kids.
Well, I'd rather not, actually.
She's, um--
- Go ahead, Michael.
It won't hurt her.
- Uh, well, you know how she is around people, Peter.
She's so--
Michael, will you let him hold her.
He's not gonna hurt her.
He's a police officer.
- All right.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
Oh.
Oh.
You're a heavy little girl, aren't you?
Yes.
Yes, she really is heavy, isn't she?
- She's a good eater.
- Yeah.
That's a good sign.
It means she won't grow up to be a nervous adult.
You've got nothing to be nervous about, have you, sweetie?
- Feels as though she's ready for a change.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
- Oh.
You know babies.
- Yep.
- All they do is eat, sleep and poop.
- Here, Michael.
- Yeah, I'll take her.
- Good idea.
Oh, what a cute little baby.
Uh, do you happen to know where her father is at the moment?
- No.
Uh, yeah, he's on location, uh, doing a TV movie.
- Huh?
- But I-I don't have any idea where.
- Uh, do you know this guy?
Oh, not very well.
He's a friend of Jack's.
Uh, I don't remember his name.
His name is Paul Milner.
He directs TV commercials.
And on the side, he just happens to dabble in a little heroin smuggling.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I don't know him.
I don't--
I'd appreciate that glass of water now, Mr Mitchell.
- Of course.
No problem.
- Thank you.
I got it.
- Hi, this is Peter...
- Michael...
- and Jack.
- We're out playing and we can't come to the phone--
- But we'll call you back.
- Shit!
- So please leave a message at the sound of the tone.
- Hold on.
Whoever it is, I'm here.
- Uh, Peter!
Jack.
Yeah, how are you?
L-Listen, uh, I got a message saying you're trying to get through to me.
What's up?
Jack, Michael and I really have to talk to you, but, uh, uh, you called us at a bad time.
We'll call back later.
Wh-whoa, wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
Don't hang up.
I'm calling from Turkey.
It took me an hour to put this call through.
It's not an easy place to phone from, you know.
Hey, Peter, this place is amazing.
You will not believe some of the stuff I bought for you guys.
-Jack!
- I mean, the shit is so cheap here.
I probably bought too much of it, but what the hell, I can always smuggle it in.
-Just kidding.
-Jack, thanks for calling.
Uh, and we'll see you when you get back.
I gotta get him a glass of water so his mouth doesn't go dry when he reads me my rights.
- Here you are, Sergeant.
- Oh, thanks.
Goodbye.
Nice talking to you.
It was very illuminating.
- He heard the phone call.
- We're dead.
- You think Jack's involved in this?
- I don't know.
We gotta talk to Paul Milner.
- Why him?
- Because he is involved.
Couldn't you think of somewhere better to hide the drugs?
Hey, it was perfect until you insisted that he hold the baby.
All right, you're right, Michael.
I'm sorry.
Where'd you put 'em now?
In the garbage pail under the other dirty diapers.
Nobody's gonna look for it there.
You realize we're in trouble with this cop.
You realize, of course, that no one's coming back to get this kid.
- ...is not in service.
-Jesus, you're right.
We're stuck with her until Jack gets back.
It's disconnected.
- Oh, I'm late.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute, so am I.
Oh, damn it.
Mr Kellam?
Mr Mitchell?
- Hello, Mrs Hathaway.
- Oh, Mr Mitchell.
It seems that a horse has befouled the front walk.
Do you know anything about it?
- Mrs Hathaway, how nice to see you.
- Really nice to see you.
Oh.
- She can sit till 5:00.
- Well, I'll try and hurry.
Me too.
I'm worried.
- I got the one with the mustache.
- I'll call Sergeant Melkowitz and tell him we're moving.
Right.
There.
Here you go, pal.
What can I do for ya?
I'd like, uh, Sports Illustrated, Popular Science, some of this gum... and that giraffe up there.
- Which one's the giraffe?
- The rubber one.
That's not a giraffe.
That's a dinosaur.
- Whatever.
- You mean the one with the little polka dots up there?
- Yes, uh, thank you.
- That's a dinosaur.
A giraffe has big ears.
- I don't care whether it has ears or not.Just give me the damn thing.
- It's got little ears.
It's a dinosaur.
- Hey, what about your change?
- Never mind.
- What about your change, pal?
He left at 4:00.
He'll be back on Thursday.
Mrs Hathaway.
Mrs Hathaway, I'm home.
Mrs Hathaway.
Mrs Hathaway, where's Mary?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
- Where's Mary?
Mary?
Oh, my God.
Mary!
Mary!
Mary.
Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
Thank God.
Thank God.
No, everything's fine, darling.
Everything's fine.
Don't you worry.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
No.
It's okay.
Peter?
Peter!
She's okay.
She's not hurt.
- How are you?
- I'm fine.Just--
See what those bastards did to my videotapes?
We got a message.
What'd it say?
"Next time we'll take the baby."
- It's okay.
It's okay.
- Mr Kellam.
Mr Mitchell!
"The champ caught Smith with a savage left hook...
"that sent the challenger crashing into the ropes.
"Smith, his left eye swollen and the cut above his right eye now much more bloody... countered with a barrage of vicious body blows."
- What are you reading her?
- It doesn't matter what I read.
It's the tone you use.
She doesn't understand the words anyway.
Now, where were we?
"The champ began the fifth round...
"like a man possessed...
"going straight for his opponent's body... with ferocious energy."
Here you go, darlin'.
Stupid-
- I can't believe--
My face!
Watch out for my face!
Peter, it's me,Jack!
-Jack!
-Jesus,Jack!
- Get up!
- No, wait--
- W-What are you-
- Get him off!
- You irresponsible-
- Come here!
- What is it with you guys?
- We should be asking you that question!
- Why?
What'd I do?
- What the hell are you doing back so soon anyway?
- My part got cut.
Okay?
- Good!
What is with him?
Wh--Je--
Look at this place.
Will somebody please tell me what the hell is goin' on around here?
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit!
What was that?
No, I'm not goin' anywhere until you tell me what's goin' on.
- We'll be glad to.
- That really hurt, Peter.
- Ow, ow, ow.
- Sunday morning I come back from jogging... to find this basket with this baby in it waiting in the vestibule.
- Well, why--
- Inside is a little note from a Sylvia... saying that the baby was yours and she was leaving it here for you to deal with it.
- M-Mine?
- Then along comes another little package with your name on it... only this time the package has heroin in it... and the narcotics squad permanently camped downstairs knows all about it.
The cops?
I don't believe this.
I don't know anything about any drugs or any police.
I mean, I thought I was just doing a favour for Paul.
I didn't know what was in that package.
And I certainly don't know anything about that baby.
I mean, for God's sake, somebody drops a baby off on, on your doorstep, and you automatically assume he's mine?
Look, the child doesn't look anything like me.
I'm bigger and, and I have more hair.
"Dear Jack, Here is our baby.
I can't handle this now.
I don't know where else to turn.
S--"
Sylvia?
Oh, my--
Oh, my God.
Stratford.
Ayear and a ha--
Ayear and a half ago.
I was doing Taming of the Shrew.
She was the shrew.
I mean, I did some of my best work in that.
- I got great reviews.
-Jack, you're such a jerk.
- You're always thinkin' about yourself.
I wanna kill you.
- Michael, you won't have to.
Jack, I would like to introduce you to your daughter Mary.
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, you guys.
You can't be sure that this is my kid.
Uh-
- Um--
- What the hell am I supposed to do with it?
- We've put our lives on hold,Jack, taking care of this kid... and now it's your turn.
Okay.
All right.
All right, fine.
All right, until I straighten this mess out, I'll, uh, I'll take care of her.
I mean, sure, why not?
I'm an actor.
I can, uh, I can do a father.
Yeah.
Yeah.
See, huh?
What could be so difficult, huh?
Yeah.
- Goodnight,Jack.
- Goodnight,Jack.
- Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Oh.
Down we go.
W-W-Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What-What's the matter with her?
- Goodnight,Jack.
- Goodnight,Jack.
Hold still, kid.
Gee-
- Hey, how do you put on these goddam things anyway?
Figure it out for yourself, dickhead.
- Nice shot.
- Look at that stuff.
Oh, my God!
What are you guys feeding her, huh?
Oh, no, no, please!
Not on the silk sheets.
Not on the silk sheets.
Please, please!
Maybe I should show him how to put on the diaper.
Oh, no.
I don't believe this.
Why me?
Oh, come on, baby.
Nope.
Let's give him another half hour.
Let him suffer.
Yes, yes, I'm trying to reach Paul Milner.
No, he was supposed to be in San Francisco, but I can't find him.
Wo-Would you please tell him to call Jack Holden as soon as he gets in?
- Is this urgent?
- Yeah, urgent's an understatement.
Lady.
I don't know why I bother giving you this.
It just goes right through you.
- Did you get a hold of your friend?
- No.
- Don't forget to bolt the door.
- I won't.
And remember, there's a quarter of a million dollars in heroin in that diaper pail.
- And the new baby wipes are in the cabinet.
- Right.
Heroin's in the diaper pail.
Baby wipes are in the cabinet.
Where else would they be?
I can't believe this.
You're kidding me.
Thirty-two Benningtons i-in the London area?
Yes, sir.
Uh, uh, uh, I'll get back to you.
I-I--
Oh, boy.
Oh, baby.
Look, I-I know.
I know.
I know.
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
Oh, God.
Y-Yeah.
Well, we tried your mommy.
Maybe I should, uh--
Maybe I should try mine, huh?
Yeah.
Mom?
- Well, where is she?
- Oh, Mom, wait till you see her.
Oh, you won't believe this.
She is so beautiful.
She looks just like you.
- You know, you boys live like pigs.
- Oh, Mom.
Look, look.
There.
Isn't she beautiful?
There she is.
Look at that little baby!
- Yeah.
- You're such a pretty little girl.
Will you come to me?
I'm gonna pick you right up.
- Yes, I'm gonna pick you right up.
- Oh, I am in awe.
I mean, look at you.
You-You pick her up like a pro.
I pick her up like a grandmother.
It's called experience.
Darling.
Let's see you.
Oh, she's so lovely.
What's her name?
- Mary.
- Mary.
Well, Mary!
Look at the way she's looking at me.
-For a moment there, I had her laughing.
-Yeah, just like me, huh?
Don't ruin this for me,Jack.
- Oh!
- Oh, she adores you!
- You-
- Well, well, well.
- She knows that you're her grandmother.
It's like a-
- It's like a biological thing, an instant connection.
Cut the crap,Jack.
What do you want?
Mom, I can't take care of her.
I don't know what to do.
I was kinda hoping that-- that maybe you could take her, just for a little while.
Not forever.
You know, until she's ready to vote.
Oh, I would love to.
Do you know,Jack?
Some people live all their lives... without having anything as wonderful as this to show for it?
- I know, Mom.
- So I'm gonna do the most wonderful thing in the world for you.
Absolutely nothing.
Why?
Jack, you've always run away from responsibility.
Now you have to turn and face it.
Mom, I'm a screw-up.
You were a screw-up.
Now you're a father.
And you'll be a fine one.
- You think so?
- I know it.
Your father, God rest his soul... he was a screw-up and he turned out just fine.
- Really?
- Don't you remember?
- Well, yeah, I guess.
- Now, give me a kiss.
Mary, give me a kiss.
And now, you and your friends clean this place up.
If not for yourselves, do it for my granddaughter.
- We-We will.
We will.
- Bye.
Bye.
Thanks anyway, Mom.
Well, looks like it's just you and me now, kid.
What?
Mama.
Oh,Jack?
There's four bottles prepared already.
So you should be fine till tomorrow morning.
And if her bottom gets red, you just give her a bottle of water.
Works miracles.
In about three hours, white as marble.
We'll be in seats D-1 1 , 1 2, 1 3 and 1 4.
Yeah, if there's a problem, just call.
The usher will come and get us.
Oh!
Here's the number.
- Wait a minute.
Are you leaving right now?
- Yeah, now.
- When are you coming back?
- About midnight.
All right.
Don't worry about us.
Wait a minute.
Is this a four?
Yeah, it's a four.
It's good to have.
So, uh, what do you want to do?
You know, this show's been running longer than Mary's been alive?
Peter, we agreed not to mention her name tonight, right?
- Right.
My mistake.
- Who did you guys con into sitting for you?
-Jack.
-Jack?
Daddy?
Patty.
Are you hungry?
Huh?
Well, we're in luck here.
Uh, oh-ho-ho!
Tonight, uh, the chef has, uh... cooked up something very special for you.
He has taken the juice of one cow... and, uh, sauteed it, uh, with a fine sauce.
It is, uh, presented surrounded by a bottle... and topped off, uh, with a delicious rubber nipple, huh?
Oh-ho.
Yes.
Oh, excellent choice.
Yes, yes.
Here we go.
Oh, yes.
Wh-What?
Here you go.
Come on.
Please?
You don't want it, huh?
Yeah, I just changed you.
Huh?
And you're not hungry.
What else is there in life?
I always wanted to be a musical comedy star.
- Did you ever try?
- No.
Ladies and gentlemen, act two will begin in three minutes.
Three minutes.
Michael, have you ever done any acting?
No.
No, I leave that to Jack.
The idiot.
I got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside I've got the month of May
I guess you say
What can make me feel this way My girl
But maybe he fell asleep.
Maybe he fell and hit his head.
He's probably unconscious.
- Will you come on?
It's started.
- It's terrible, terrible.
- I had a great time.
- I'll see you at P.J.'s later.
Oh, you can sing us a song from the second act, okay?
Are they always this strange?
Yes, since they got involved with another woman.
Wasn't that fun, huh?
Yeah.
Oh, cover that.
-Jack?
-Jack, where are you?
-Jack!
- I'm right here.
What?
What?
- What are you doing?
- Well, what's it look like I'm doing, Peter?
- Is everything all right?
- Everything's fine, yeah.
Why you guys back so soon anyway, huh?
Uh, we thought that we might have left the stove on.
No, no.
The stove's not on.
I think that Uncle Peter and Uncle Michael are having a nervous breakdown, yes.
I called,Jack.
I let the phone ring for five minutes.
- Why didn't you answer the phone?
- Well, because Mary and I were taking a shower.
Weren't we?
Yeah, we didn't hear anything.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Isn't that the truth, mademoiselle?
Yes.
Oh, you are cute, yes.
I never put a phone in a shower before.
- You get many calls in here?
- A steady stream.
- What if you slipped down there?
- Well, I did try.
- We did pretty well for the first time out.
- Yeah.
- Here.
- What?
"Commercial director hospitalized after mugging."
- What?
- Yeah, take a look at this.
This is your friend, Paul Milner.
"Don't let this happen to you.
"Be at the phone booth at the corner of 81 st and Columbus... at exactly 8:00 p.m. tonight."
They're trying to intimidate us.
I hate that.
- I've had enough of this doo-doo.
- I want to finish this, okay?
Hello?
Yeah, we got your message.
Uh-uh.
No good.
We do it our way.
Because we got the stuff, and if you don't do it our way--
- Come on.
- Say it, say it.
We flush it down the toilet!
Okay, now listen, and listen good.
There's a-- a construction site.
Car 20 following suspects, southbound Central Park West.
Come on, Peter!
- Damn it,Joe!
We lost 'em!
- I got it.
Three blocks, turn around.
That was great.
That was great.
Everybody remember what they're supposed to do?
Oh, come on, Peter.
It's not that complicated a plan.
Yeah, next he's gonna want us to synchronize our watches, right?
Should we do that?
Yes, thank you.
Hello, Sergeant Melkowitz.
Uh, my name is Jack Holden.
I think you know my two roommates.
I must have been crazy to agree to this.
Goddam.
- Orange elevator.
Here it is.
- Right.
Close door.
- Okay, 1 5, please.
- Fifteen?
Yeah.
I'm all filthy and everything.
What's wrong, my sweetheart?
Come here.
What is it, huh?
Sweetie.
Oh.
Well, you should have told me before we left.
Oh, boy, this is not a-- this is not a good time to do this.
Hold still.
Oh, you make such a-- There you go.
Michael.
They're here.
- Hey, look.
Hey, you know, this is really aggravating.
- I'm here.
- I'm here by the pipes.
- You know, I don't have a lot of time, but, uh--
- Hold it.
- What, what, what?
- Hold it!
All right, just hold it.
Look, where is the stuff?
Will you give it to me?
- It's in the elevator.
- Oh, bullshit.
Uh, i-it's in the control panel.
Uh, check for yourself.
What am I supposed to do, bring my handy little tool kit here?
You realize that, uh... we had absolutely nothing to do with this.
We had no idea what was in the package.
Yeah, no kidding.
I mean, I could have figured that out in about four seconds.
I mean, you know, you guys don't behave like a couple of pros.
- You know what I mean?
- Right.
- Yeah.
- We're not pros.
- I just said that, didn't I?
I'm sensitive to that.
I mean, why do you make it so complicated?
- We've never done this.
- I got it.
- Great.
You're forgiven this time.
Very wise of you to cooperate, finally.
- Glad it's over.
- No-No happier than I am, believe me.
I mean, dealing with, uh, amateurs is a real pain in the ass.
- So is dealing with professionals.
- No doubt.
Hey, what is that?
- What, are you abusing my trust here or what?
- Whoa!
- There's someone in there!
- Come on.
Come on, Michael.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, look-- look out.
- I lost my balance.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I got it!
- We got 'em!
Who's doing this?
Huh?
I want that camera, punk!
- There's six switches!
- Aw, these guys wrecked my day.
-Jack!
- What the hell happened?
- He hit the wrong button.
- He what?
- Can it go any faster or what?
- This is it.
- Huh?
Come on.
You punks!
-Jack!
-Jack!
- Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.
I want that home movie.
I'll wait for you.
I want that movie.
- Oh, no.
-Jack!
- Hit the button on the left!
- The button on the left,Jack!
- What?
What?
- Hit the button on the left!
There is no left.
The le--
- Come on, get it going faster, will ya?
Is that it?
- I can't.
Please.
- Hey, why are we stopped?
What's the matter?
Huh?
- I don't understand.
- Why is this elevator stopped?
- What do you want?
It's dead.
The whole thing's no good.
I got 'em!
- It ain't running.
It just ain't running.
- What's going on?
- Did you hit the button?
Jesus.
- Yeah, it's dead.
- Oh, boy.
Uncle Peter and Uncle Michael are gonna be plenty ticked off with Daddy.
- Aren't you glad he's on our side?
- What happened?
What happened?
Can you get--
You wait for me.
I know where you live, man!
- Oh, no, no, Vince.
- Oh, why?
Why is this happening?
- Oh, no!
- Why is this happening?
Why?
Okay.
It's okay, guys.

Yes, yes, I am.
Hey!
Oh, thanks for the phone call.
Oh, actually it was, uh, Peter's idea.
Hi, guys.
- She's okay, she's okay.
- Hello, Sergeant.
-The guys you want are in that elevator.
-The drugs are up there too.
- Everything you need to know is right here.
- It's very illuminating.
Oh, thanks.

She's fine.
She's teething.
That can be rough.

Come on in.
I don't believe how wonderful she looks!
Oh!
Hello, Mary.
Hello, my darling.
It's your mommy.
Yes, it's your mommy.
You're very beautiful.
Your hair is growing.
You've changed so much, and I've missed it.
Mommy has missed you.
Oh, I never thought I'd miss her this much.
Hello!
Hello!
Where's my baby?
Is Jack here?
- I'll get him.
- Mary, look how big you've gotten!
Michael.
Michael.
Sylvia's here.
Mary's leaving.
She looks very happy,Jack.
You've obviously taken good care of her.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have left her the way I did.
I hope it didn't cause too much trouble.
Uh, no, no.
No trouble at all.
Sylvia.
There's something I need to know.
Is she really mine?
Yes.
She is.
So, uh, what are you gonna do now?
Do you-
- Do you have any idea?
I, um--
I'm going home.
I can't work and take care of Mary on my own... so, um... we're going to move in with my family.
They said they'd help.
You're going to London?
Yeah.
When?
Tonight.
- Is that what you really want to do?
- Sorry?
Never mind.
- You pack all the bottles?
- Yeah.
And cans of formula?
- You packed 'em.
- Yeah.
What about the blender?
Maybe we should give her that, to mash up bananas and stuff.
Sure.
And diapers?
You pack extra Pampers?
Yeah.
How can he let her go?
If I were Jack, I would not let her go.
Neither would I, Michael.
Neither would I.
But he's the father.
I don't think he wants her to go... but he just can't admit it.
You know, if you want anything, anything at all, you call us, okay?
She'll probably be hungry in an hour.
She's a real good eater, so, uh--
- Like her daddy.
- Some of this stuff's fragile in here.
- Okay, I got it.
- You know, if she-- if she wakes up in the middle of the night... she likes to be sung to.
'50s and '60s music works best.
- Thanks.
I'll remember that.
- You're all set.
Everything's packed.
If there's anything else you need, just, uh, call us.
- Anything.
Okay?
- Thank you.
Well, maybe, uh--
Here, let me, uh-
- Go ahead.
- Gloucester Hotel, please.
- The Gloucester, okay.
I'll write and let you know how we're doing.
Come on, darling.
Wave goodbye, sweetheart.
- Bye, Mary.
- Bye, Mary.
Goodnight, sweetheart Well, it's time to go
Goodnight, sweetheart Well, it's time to go
I hate to leave you but I really must say
Oh, goodnight, sweetheart Goodnight
Goodnight, sweetheart Well, it's time to go
Goodnight, sweetheart Well, it's time to go
I hate to leave you I really must say
Oh, goodnight, sweetheart Goodnight
Well, it's 3.:00
In the morning
Baby, I just can't do right
Well, I hate to leave you, baby
I don't mean maybe
Because I love you so
Goodnight, sweetheart Well, it's time to go
Goodnight, sweetheart Well, it's time to go
I hate to leave you I really must say
Oh, goodnight, sweetheart Goodnight
I hate to leave you I really must say
Oh, goodnight, sweetheart Goodnight
Guys like us shouldn't be raising kids anyway.
Right?
Well, should we?
I suppose not.
She's better off with her mother.
And we are definitely better off now that everything's back to normal.
- Right?
- Whatever you say,Jack.
Right.
So how come I feel so bad?
What'd you say?
How come I feel so bad?
I have this ache right here.
I don't know.
What do you think, Mike?
- It could be the wine.
- It's not the wine.
Well, what is it then?
I don't know.
I wish it would go away.
Maybe it's something you ate.
- Maybe you're not getting enough sleep.
- It's not that.
Then what the hell is it?
I miss Mary.
Okay?
I miss Mary.
I just wish there was something I could do.
Well, maybe there is.
- What?
- When's her flight leaving?
- Yo, taxi!
- Taxi!
- Taxi!
- Taxi!
- Kennedy Airport.
- Yeah, Kennedy.
Kennedy Airport.
- Who you guys chasing?
- My baby girl.
- Her mother's taking her to London.
- Oh, yeah?
How old?
- Se-Seven months.
- Seven months.
- Seven months?
That's hard work.
But pretty soon, they start to walk.
And let me tell you, the first time you hear the word "Daddy"...
I don't care who you are, your heart just melts.
- Can you drive a little faster, please?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
- Good luck to you.
Thanks.
Good luck, guys.
Four.
Gate four.
Excuse me, sir.
Hold it, fellas.
One at a time.
Please, one at a time.
Any metal.
Put it in here, please.
Thank you, sir.
One at a time.
Thank you.
One, two, three, four.
Four!
- 1 76.
Flight 1 76?
- That's it.
Thank you.
Goodnight.
Sylvia, are you all right?
What happened?
- We thought you'd gone.
- I couldn't go,Jack.
I couldn't do it.
I mean, I don't want to make another mistake.
And I knew if I took her away, I'd just be making another mistake.
I mean, I-I have to work.
I mean, I can't do that and take care of Mary alone.
I mean, do you know what it's like?
A one-room flat, on your feet all day... working or auditioning.
And I'm on the job sometimes until 3:00 in the morning.
- And since Mary gets up at 5:30--
- Oh, I know, I know.
It's awful.
- I mean, you can imagine how much sleep I get.
- Yeah.
A-And after the 5:30 bottle, it starts all over again at 9:00.
And by the time I change her and play with her a little, it's already 8:00.
Well, forget about sleeping after that.
It's impossible.
And then the babysitters until 3:00 in the morning.
All my money is sucked down the tubes.
And me so tired.
I can't take Mary to the park.
Oh, tell me about it.
Gettin' time to take her to the park?
That's a bitch.
- Sit down.
- I mean, I love my job, but...
I sometimes feel like I'm just working to pay the sitters... and I run around all day... and I-I don't get enough sleep.
And what's worse, I don't think I'm taking very good care of Mary.
- No, of course you are.
- I am?
I mean, I couldn't cope.
- Sylvia, we know how hard it is.
- Yeah, there's three of us.
We could hardly manage.
And I don't want to go to London.
I want to work in New York.
But I can't do that alone.
I hope I don't have to.
I need help.
I need someone to help me.
We'll help.
We will help.
- Yes, yes, absolutely.
I mean, you can leave her anytime you want.
- Yes.
Yes.
- We'd love to have her.
- Oh, gosh, yeah.
When you go for an audition or-- or you go shopping, or-- or whatever.
- You want to be by yourself.
- I was hoping you would say that.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- Really?
Oh--
- Thank you so much.
Mary.
- Yeah, of course.
Hold it, guys.
I don't think I like this arrangement.
I just don't want to be Mary's babysitter.
I want-
- We want to be able to see her all the time.
May I?
I-I agree.
So what are you saying?
What do you-
- What do you mean?
I'm saying... that I think Mary should move in with us permanently... that we should be her family.
Well, I-I think it's lovely of you to offer, Peter... but I-I couldn't let Mary--
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- Oh, no, you don't understand.
You're right, Sylvia.
She's-
- She's your daughter.
She needs a full-time mother.
- That's why we think that-- that-- that you should move in too.
- We-
- We--
- Oh, it's a great idea.
Oh, Sylvia.
- Yeah!
- I--
- What do you think?
Come on.
- Of course, it's better than-- Four is better than three.
Uh-
- Do you-
- Do you have room?
I'll build you a room.
I'll build Mary a room.
- That's what he does in life.
- Yeah, that's what he does.
He builds rooms.
- Oh, please, say yes.
- Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!

- Good evening.
- Is this the penthouse?
- Yes, ma'am.
- On the roof.
Welcome to another edition of Lifestyles of the Average and Anxious.
We move about the apartment of Peter Mitchell... young architect about town.
It's his late 30s-
- Or is it his early 40s?
We'll never know- birthday party!
- Hi!
Entranced by the euphoria and ease... these glamourous people exude...
I think I spy the birthday boy himself.
Peter!
How are you, old chum?
You're looking so well, so well.
Over here is his semi-main squeeze, Rebecca Davidson.
The public wants to know what an attractive, witty, successful woman sees... in a bozo like my roommate.
Well, he's, um, he's charming and he's sweet.
He's very thoughtful.
He's sort of boyishly handsome.
But he has got the most amazing--
- Thank you, Rebecca.
- You're welcome, Michael.
So, Peter, tell me, are you and Rebecca still exclusive?
Hmm?
- Me and Rebecca?
- Yeah.
- No, we both see other people.
- Oh, really?
Oh.
- Yeah, a lot.
- Oh, that's nice to know.
- Bye, Vanessa.
- Bye.
- Hey, uh, birthday boy.
- Oh, hi, Adam.
- Rebecca's looking sexier than ever.
- Yeah.
- You two, uh, still together?
- Oh, yeah.
Me and Rebecca for five years now.
- Tight.
Tight as ever.
Excuse me.
- Cool.
- Good lovin'
- Gimme that good, good lovin'
- Good lovin'
-All I need is good lovin'
- Good lovin'
-James!
- Yeah, baby.
- Remember the Young Rascals?
What happened to them?
- Man, they old.
- No, don't say that.
- Real old.
- I think one of them's a senator now.
- No, God, no, no!
- A real old senator!
-Jack.Jack. Can I talk to you for a minute?
Paul, I'm serious.
I'm not doing commercials any more.
Really.
No more talking T-bones or cowboys with heartburn.
I'm only doing serious stuff now.
- Hi.
How are ya?
- Oh,Jack.
Whew!
Angela.
Whew, boy, you look different.
What happened?
- I'm dressed.
- That's it.
That's it.
Everybody gather 'round now
Move your body to the beat
Gentlemen, I'm in love.
- You?
- Yeah.
In a generic sense.
- Right.
Right.
- Oh, my.
Oh.
- So many women--
- And so little time.
So little time, yeah.
- So,Jack.
- Yeah, what's up?
- You're not really gonna do this movie in Turkey, are ya?
- Yes.
Yes, I am.
As a matter of fact, I leave in a few short hours.
Here.
- What is it, uh, Zalmon the Beautician?
- Barbarian.
Zalmon the Barbarian.
I knew you were gonna say that.
Okay, well, what about the play in Soho?
The one you said you wanted to do.
- You said it was a chance to--
- Uh, excuse me, please.
Excuse me.
You said it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
- Hi.
- Oh, come on.
What d-
- What do you want, my inevitably brilliant reviews, or, uh, next month's rent?
Forget about next month's rent.
I'll cover you, you do the play.
That's sweet of you.
You know, you are a very decent man, Peter.
- I'm a goddamned saint.
- "Saint" is a little bit much, but--
Hey, how's it goin', baby?
Name's Johnny.
Gimme five.
Ooh, I mean, gimme three.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can't believe you draw Johnny Cool.
Coolest cat in the world, right?
No one cooler, baby.
I can't believe it.
Makes me so happy.
- What's wrong?
- It's David.
- The guy you broke up with?
- The good-looking one.
Incredibly good-looking.
He used to read me Johnny Cool every morning over breakfast.
Hey.
Hey, hey.
Oh, you poor baby.
You know how to get over a lover, hmm?
Dance with a stranger.
David's an incredible dancer.
He studied for three years with the Joffrey Ballet.
Three years?
Joffrey Ballet?
I think you guys are gonna get back together.
You think that I could call him up and invite him to the party?
Uh, yeah, uh--
Come on, shake your body Baby, do that conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the beat It's getting stronger
Don't you fight it till you try to do that conga beat
Twins!
There it is.
Yeah!
Arguably one of the best clutch shots of all time.
Forget the guys playing today.
Nobody played this game better than Reed, West, Chamberlain, Baylor.
I'll run it for you again in slow motion.
People are asking for you.
Come on, let's go mingle.
I hate that word.
It sounds like something sea lions do before they mate.
You are the guest of honour, and they love you.
Of course they do, but these guys need me in here.
Don't you need me in here, guys?
- Go on, get outta here.
- Leave your money.
- Yeah, we need that.
- Wait, there it is.
- Yeah!
- Undoubtedly, the greatest clutch shot in basketball history.
- ...clutch shot in basketball...
- Unarguably.
- In slow motion.
The best.
Oh, Paul, Paul.
Wait, wait.
Listen to me, man.
You are my friend.
You're a great director.
But I am not doing commercials ever again.
I mean it.
Jack, I don't want you to do a commercial.
I need a favour.
Oh.
Yeah, all right, shoot.
What?
I'm having a package delivered tomorrow, but I won't be home to get it.
I gotta go off to San Francisco all week on a commercial shoot.
- You're gonna shoot in San Francisco?
- Yeah.
- Who are you using?
- Oh, Len Peters.
Lenny.
Lenny.
What's wrong?
Didn't you like my last dog food commercial?
Oh,Jack, that was a classic.
But now look, I was hoping that I could have this package delivered here instead.
Sure, no problem.
No problem.
Listen, let me ask you something here.
- Do you think I'm overexposed?
- Overexposed?
Oh, no,Jack, not at all.
Now look, it'll be delivered tomorrow and picked up by a couple of guys on Thursday morning.
- That's all there is to it.
- All right.
Tomorrow, pick up Thursday.
Okay, but this is-- this is a very delicate matter,Jack, so don't mention it to anybody, all right?
- All right, yeah.
Delicate.
- Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Peter
Happy birthday to you
He's so shy.
- Speech!
Speech!
- Oh, look, um--
First of all, um, uh...
I wanna thank, uh, Jack and Michael and Rebecca... for, uh, embarrassing me with this unending flow of sentiment.
- Oh!
- I, uh--
- Thanks for coming.
- Hey, all right!
All right!
- Go on!
Blow out the candles!
Quick!
- Whoa!
Whoa!
I think everybody had a great time.
Don't you?
I sure did.
Why don't you stick around a while?
I thought sentiment made you uncomfortable.
- I can handle it...
- Mm-hmm.
as long as it's disguised as sex.
So stay tonight.
I can't.
- I have to be up at 7:00 for a pretrial meeting.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
Happy birthday, Peter.
Mmm.
Yeah, right.
It was a great party.
You know, in this light you're kinda ugly.
Yeah.
Yeah, that rut in the middle of your forehead?
Gettin' out of hand.
Out of hand.
- How come that always happens to you?
- What?
Well, as soon as you get a woman into your room... you turn into her big brother and start solving her problems.
Well, unlike yourself and our sexually insatiable roommate...
I happen to be a sensitive guy, and I have more on my mind than simply pronging chicks.
Hey, guys.
Say, what's a good year for pronging chicks?
The '82 bordeaux on the left works every time.
Thank you very much.
- What happened here?
Somebody die?
- Rebecca left early.
- Oh.
- Michael saved another doomed relationship.
Post-party depression.
Listen, you guys, you know, I'm outta here tomorrow for ten weeks.
What do you say I get rid of Cherise--
No, no, the three of us hunker down here with a bottle of wine and shoot some pool.
I got a better idea.
Why don't you two guys hunker down, shoot some pool, and I'll, uh, take--
- No, no, no.
- Why don't you just go and have a good time?
- Yeah, enjoy yourself.
- Oh, guys.
Tough job, but it's gotta be done.
Oh.
- He's unbelievable.
- The man is one giant gland.
-Jack.
- Seventy-nine.
-Jack!
- He left already, Cherise.
Eighty.
- Hi, this is Peter, Michael and Jack.
- Great.
I think he took my mousse.
- We're out playing and can't come to the phone.
- That's our boy.
Eighty-two.
- We'll call you back as soon as we can.
- So leave a message at the sound of the tone.
- Thanks, Peter.
See you around.
Yeah.
Eighty-four.
Hi, it's me, Jack.
Uh, I'm at the airport just about to board the plane.
But I forgot to tell you something.
There's a package gonna be delivered today.
Uh, some guys'll pick it up Thursday before noon.
Just put it aside, don't worry about it.
And, oh, wait a minute.
It's, uh, it's a very delicate matter, so don't, don't say anything to anybody.
Okay?
I'll bring you guys something back from Turkey if you're good.
Maybe a drumstick or somethin'.
- See you later.
Bye-bye.
- Ninety.
- Hi, Harry.
- Good morning, sir.
Michael!
Michael, get out here!
- What is it?
-Just get out here.
What?
- What's goin' on?
- I don't know.
What's goin' on?
Oh, okay.
Just look out in the hall.
- Yeah?
-Just look out in the hall.
Okay.
- That's a baby.
- Oh, I know it's a baby.
- What's it doing there?
- It's sleeping.
Oh, okay.
Who do you suppose it belongs to?
Oh, Peter, there's a little note.
All right, I'll just go in and... okay, play along.
"Dear Jack, here is our baby--"
Oh, no.
- You really don't know anything about this?
- I knew it.
I knew it.
I knew this was gonna happen to him sooner or later.
- "I can't handle this now.
I don't know where else to turn.
- Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Right.
- "Someday I hope you can both forgive me.
- Unbelievable.
Her name is Mary.
Love, Sylvia." Who's Sylvia?
How am I supposed to know?
You have to be a social secretary to keep track of all his women.
He left a message about a package.
He said it'd be delivered today.
He said to put it aside and not to worry about it.
- He said that about a baby?
- I'd say he takes his procreation business a little lightly.
- So what are we supposed to do about this?
- We pick it up.
- You pick it up.
- I'm not picking it up.
You found it!
- Look, we gotta do something.
One of us has to pick it up.
- Well, it's not gonna be me!
Now what?
I don't know anything about taking care of babies.
Well, neither do I!
- Look, we gotta do something!
- Be my guest.
- Hey, it's not my responsibility.
- It's not mine either!
- Don't yell at me, Peter.
- Well, it can't be that difficult.
All we gotta do is, is feed it.
It'll shut up.
- Well, I don't know what babies eat.
- Soft stuff.
I mean, we were babies once, for God's sake.
What did-
- What did we eat?
I don't know.
It couldn't have been very good.
I can't remember.
- Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Where you goin'?
- I'm going to the market to get some baby food.
We can't feed it birthday cake and goat cheese.
- So what am I supposed to do?
- Entertain it.
"Entertain it."
Entertain it?
How do you entertain a baby?
Hey, junior.
Hey, look.
L-Look at my hands.
Hey.
Hey.
Look at this.
Look at this.
Oh, it's a-- it's a gla-- it's a prism.
Whoa.
Look at those colours, huh?
This is nice stuff, huh?
This is expensive.
You don't like that, huh?
Well, how about, uh-
- Oh!
Ooh, look!
It's almost like, uh--
Look,Japanese origami, almost, with the hands.
It's a bird!
It's a bird!
No, huh?
Uh-
- Uh-
- I'm gettin' a headache.
You're givin' me a headache.
Uh, how about, uh-- how about this?
How about this?
Look at this.
Look at the hairy chest.
You like that?
You like that?
You wanna-
- You want one of these?
Price check!
Excuse me.
Uh, where could I get a jar of baby food?
- Uh, third aisle to the right.
- Right.
-Joe, I need a cheque okay on three.
- It's the larger size?
- Got it.
- This is cheaper.
- Oh.
They gotta be kidding.
What's happenin', baby?
How you doin' today, huh?
My name is Johnny.
That's right.
That's right.
But you can call me Mr Cool.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Hey, wh-what's your name, huh?
Huh?
Haven't I seen you around the neighbourhood?
Come on, baby, wh-
- Wait, what's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?
Why can't you talk?
Huh?
Huh?
Come on, kid, laugh it up.
I'm doin' my best.
Mr Foley, I need a cheque okay on two.
Excuse me.
Uh, is this a good meal for a baby?
- That's for toddlers.
- Toddler?
What's a toddler?
- Ayear and half, two years.
- No, no, I-I need something for a baby.
- This is your first.
- First what?
- Baby.
- Uh, yeah.
First and the last.
- No matter how much you prepare, you're never quite ready for 'em, are you?
- No, you're not.
- Um, listen, could you-
- Can you hel--
- Did you know that what an infant eats in its first 1 2 months... can determine its entire psychological and physical future?
That's fascinating, but all I need is some food.
Just some food, that's all, uh, Edna.
- What's the best-selling brand?
- That white can over there.
- Great.
This is the best, then?
- No, it's the cheapest.
That's why it sells the most.
- Uh-huh.
How about this one, then?
- Oh, that's good.
- Good.
- But it's got iron in it.
- Is that bad?
- It is if your baby's allergic to it.
- How do you know if she's allergic to it?
- They throw up all over you.
Of course, they throw up all over you even if they're not allergic to it too.
Some babies can't hold anything down for more than a minute.
- What about this one?
- That's for older babies.
How old's your baby?
- About that old.
- You don't know how old your baby is?
Yes, I do.
I know-- I know how old my baby is.
- Is she teething?
- Teething?
Well, you know, uh, does she cry all night?
Does she chew on her fist and drool a lot?
All right, okay, then I'll take three of these and I'll take some of these, and thanks very much for your time, Edna.
You've been a source of great stress.
Don't forget, if the baby's less than three months old, you gotta sterilize the nipples.
Aw, shit!
Here I come!
Hey, hey, hey, look, I'll, uh-
- I'll give you ten bucks if you stop crying.
Huh?
Ten bucks.
Huh?
You like that?
Hey, I'm gonna pick you up now, huh?
Here you go, junior.
Here you go.
Is that better?
No, huh?
All right, well, how about, uh, how about a little walk, huh?
How about a little walk?
Here, hey, wait a minute.
Let me-- Let me-
- Here you go.
Here we go.
Okay.
Hey, how 'bout this, huh?
There-
- N-No, no-no, no-no-no.
We're not gonna keep cryin'.
No, no, no, no!
No, no!
Hey, wait a minute.
Oh, look!

Hey, wait a minute.
Whoa, ooh, no!
You can-

You know that?
No.
No, not you.
You're a cute little thing.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, wait a minute.
How about-- Hush, little baby, don't you cry
When Peter gets home I'm gonna punch him in the eye-
- Hush.
All right-
- All right, here we are.
Here we are in my room.
Yeah.
Look-
- Look around here.
This is nice, huh?
Uh, uh, maybe you can, uh-- Here, we'll sit down here and, uh--
Oh, look!
Look!
We're gonna watch a little TV.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We'll watch a little TV.
Just you and me, huh?
Here you go.
There you go.
Amuse yourself.
Women are wondering.:
Are they having an orgasm?
- Men are worried maybe their penis isn't--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
No, no, no, no, no, you don't want to hear that.
No, no, no, no, no.
Okay, we're gonna have a nice conversation with Uncle Peter... and let him have some fun now, yeah?
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Where the hell have you been?
- Oh, hi, Mrs Hathaway.
- Mr Kellam, this package just arri--
- Oh, what a darling little baby.
- Yeah.
- Is it yours?
- No, no, no, no.
It's not mine.
- Mr Mitchell's?
- No, no, no, no, no.
Someone sort of loaned it to us.
- W-We're watching her for a while.
- Well, what is its name?
Her name is, uh, it's, uh, Sylvia.
No, Mary.
Mary.
Mary.
Yeah.
Well, we've had a tough morning, and we're all tuckered out.
We've been drooling, so, uh, we're gonna just say goodbye, okay?
- Bye-bye, Mrs Hathaway.
Bye-bye.
Yeah.
- Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Oh, by the way, um, this package just arrived for you downstairs.
Uh, all right, great.
Great.
Th-Thanks, Mrs Hathaway.
- Could I hold her for just a minute?
- Oh, I don't think so.
She doesn't really--
I just love babies.
Oh, yes.
I just love babies.
Unfortunately, Mr Hathaway and I were never able to have any of our own.
- Mr Hathaway has a low sperm count.
- Well, some guys have all the luck.
Oh, oh, you are--
You are a cute little bundle, aren't you?
You do realize she did a doodle.
Yes, you did.
Would you like me to give you a hand in changing her?
No.
No, no, no, I can do it.
I-I-I'm used to it.
I'm used to it.
Well, thanks a lot, Mrs Hathaway.
We gotta go now.
All right?
So, uh, so we're gonna say bye-bye now.
- All right?
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
Bye-bye, Mary.
- Bye-bye.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Okay, bye.
- Little child.
Of course, if you ever need anyone to babysit--
All right.
Yeah?
All right.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
- Mr Mitchell, she's a lovely baby.
- Yeah, adorable.
Where the hell have you been?
This baby hasn't stopped crying since you left, and she did a doodle.
"Doodle"?
What the hell's that?
No, don't tell me.
I don't want to know.
Oh, you're gonna know, pal, 'cause she did it.
What's with all the bags?
I had to go to three different places to buy four different kinds of formula... two different kinds of diapers, bottles, towels, nipples.
You have no idea how much crap these kids need.
- How old is she, anyway?
- How should I know?
You want me to check her driver's licence?
- Feel her teeth.
- What?
-Just feel her teeth.
The druggist said that you can tell how old she is by feeling her teeth.
Well, I'm not feeling her teeth!
You feel her teeth!
I'm tired of holding her, anyway!
Here!
No!
Uh, no, I can't hold her and, and make her bottle at the same time.
All right, I'll hold her, you check for the teeth, okay?
- Come on!
- All right.
- I can't feel anything.
- What do you think that means?
- It means she doesn't have any damn teeth!
- Well, neither did Gabby Hayes, and he was 90!
So what?
All right, then we'll give her the stuff for newborns, hope she's not allergic to it.
You have no idea how much stuff these kids can be allergic to.
What's that stench?
Michael, hold her.
Just hold her.
That's it.
- Wait a minute.
Peter, this is a girl.
Should we be doing this?
- Michael, just hold her, will ya, so I can get the diaper off.
- Ohh!
- Ohh!
How can something so small create so much of something so disgusting?
Oh, God.
Beats the shit out of me.
All right, hand me the other diaper.
There, take--
- Wait a minute.
Shouldn't we wash her first?
- Uh, we'll wash her later.
Just-
- Well, give me the cotton.
Give me the-
- Oh!
How about this?
Come on.
Uh, Michael, I-- Just give me a little cotton.
- I don't need a package.
I just need some cotton.
- All right, here.
Oh, no, wait, g-
- The wipies.
Get me the g-- the, you know, the cotton wipies.
Right.
Here it is.
- All right.
- Ooh, this is disgusting.
It's all over, and it's, it's-- it's sticky and--
We're gonna need some kind of cleaning fluid to get it off.
- How about after-shave?
- Aw, come on, Michael!
Just get me one of the diapers!
All right.
All right, good.
Now, these tape things go in the front or the back?
- Uh, how am I supposed to know?
- Okay.
There.
Whoa!
These diapers are way too big.
- What size did you get, adult?
- They're ultra-absorbent.
The more absorbent the better, if you ask me.
Will you hold her for a minute?
The kid's going crazy.
I--
- I don't want to.
- Come on, Michael!
- Hey, don't pull that so hard.
It's gonna rip.
- I'm not gonna rip it.
Yes, you are.
All right, well, okay, uh, get me another diaper.
I'll use the tape.
I'll use the tape from the diaper, I'll tape it up.
I'm an architect, for Christ's sakes.
I build 50-storey skyscrapers.
I assemble cities of the future.
I can certainly put together a goddam diaper.
Take it easy, kid, all right?
There.
There.
See?
It's working.
Piece of cake.
There.
Yeah.
Nice job, Pete.
The little insect was just waiting for that diaper to fall off.
I think we're in trouble.
I'm gonna kill Jack.
I'm gonna kill him.
- This is the deal.
Yeah, that's it.
- Michael.
- What?
- You're gonna have to wash where the poop was.
- Now, come on.
- All righty.
- Come on.
- I've got that handled.
- No, no, just--
- Perfect.
- You're not getting anything off that way.
There.
There you go.
- That's clean.
Isn't that clean?
- Yeah, right.
- And her-- her privates.
- I'll rinse her.
- All right.
Rinse her out a little bit.
- There we go.
Okay.
This says-- This says "For moisturizing and--"
- Don't use the baby lotion now.
It's lotion.
- Well, it says---
- It says "Prevents chapping and chaffing."
-Just wash the baby.
Well, I should put some in there anyway just to sort of make sure she's not--
Okay.
We gotta get some help.
Jack said this is a delicate situation, that we shouldn't tell anybody.
Can you believe him, putting us through hell to save his precious reputation?
I'm not doing it any more.
Odds.
Willie, they need you over here a minute.
Make a little room.
- Well, at least it ain't raining'.
- You're gonna have a headache.
- Try sleeping' nights, Peter.
Mary, let me have the pen.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm later than usual this week for the deadline.
Come here.
Okay-
- Oh!
Actually, Sam, I-
- I don't seem to have them here after all.
I must have left them at the office, but, uh, I'll get them first thing in the morning.
Right.
Your daddy's a dead man.
- Rebecca, you're--
- Yeah, I came as soon as I got your messages.
What's the emer--
- Who are-
- Who are you?
- Um--
-Jan.
- This is Jan Clopatz.
This is Peter Mitchell.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- How do you do?
Come on.
Jan is a cellist from Hungary.
He's playing with the Brauslau Baroque Ensemble at Carnegie Hall.
- What a thrill.
- Peter, what's the emergency?
Just come with me.
This is the big emergency.
- It's a baby.
- Why is that the first thing everybody says-- "It's a baby"?
Of course it's a baby.
- It's your baby?
- No, it's not my baby.
- It's Jack's baby.
-Jack has a baby?
I realize such a concept tends to negate our belief in a benevolent God, but yes.
Well, it doesn't look like Jack.
Jack's got more hair.
I'm glad you can joke at a time like this.
See?
She needs to be held.
- Babies like to be held.
- Hmm.
- Where is he?
-Jack?
Oh.
Jack's in Turkey, which is where I'd be if my baby was in New York.
Now look, Rebecca, we're dying here.
Michael doesn't know anything about babies.
I don't know anything about babies.
On top of that, I got deadlines hanging all over me.
I've been reading these-- these books about babies.
I can't figure it out.
For instance, it says here-
- Look.
"Feed every two hours." Well, it takes me two hours to get her to eat anything.
So does it mean feed her every two hours from when I start?
- Yeah.
- Or every two hours from when I finish?
Because I've been feeding her every two hours from when I start, and I'm feeding her all the time!
- Mmm.
- So which is it?
- Why are you asking me?
- Because you're a woman.
Yeah.
That doesn't mean I automatically know what to do with babies.
Rebecca, now, pl-- please, uh, stay with me and, and help me take care of her.
- You want me to take care of her.
- Yes.
- Now?
- No, when she graduates from college.
Yes, now.
I can't do that, Peter.
Baby take very, very much work, huh?
Yeah.
Thank you for telling me that,Jan. I didn't know that.
What is he, an idiot savant?
Rebecca, we--we'll be late and--
Uh-
- W--Uh-
- Rebecca, no, now--
Rebecca, please!
Stay with me!
- I have got a date.
- Oh?
Oh, excuse me for cramping your romantic style.
Rebecca, we'll be late, huh?
- Uh, just--
- You can't be serious about this guy.
Oh, come on, Peter.
You go out with other people and so do I. We agreed to that.
You can go out with the whole damn string section for all I care.
That's not the issue.
- Right now I need you here.
- Well, I can't be here now.
- Oh!
She doodled.
- Doodled!
Yes, doodled!
What's the matter?
Don't babies doodle in Hungary?
- We're leaving.
- Uh, Rebecca, no, wait.
Come on, Rebecca, please.
Don't go.
Peter, you're a very big boy, you're very capable... and you're gonna get through this just fine.
I hate the cello.
Don't.
I keep waiting for Candid Camera to walk through the door.
- What did you cancel for tonight?
- Box seats at Shea.
You?
Dinner with Cheryl.
Two more days.
Where'd you put the baby powder?
I'll get it.
What'd you put it out there for?
We're bathing her in here.
You should have brought it in with her bath stuff.
- It's just down the hall.
- Well, we're not bathing her in the hall, are we?
Well, maybe we should start, goddam it!
You're going to clean that up.
- What time are those guys supposed to get here?
-Jack's message said before noon.
Good.
I gotta see my editor about 1 :00.
Michael, did you move my blueprints?
I need 'em for my meeting this afternoon.
Sorry.
I think she did a doodle.
Your turn to change her.
I'll give you a thousand dollars if you'll do it.
Check this out.
What do you know?
Coming!
Coming!
- Does, uh,Jack Holden live here?
- Yeah.
- Someone asked us to pick up a package.
- A package?
I love the way everybody keeps calling it a package.
You can tell Sylvia for us that she's got a lot of nerve dumping her problems in our laps.
- Who's Sylvia?
- When it first got here, we considered calling the cops.
- Hey, w-
- Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait.
No, no, w--
- But we didn't.
We stuck it out, even though it totally disrupted our lives.
No, you wait.
Hey, we haven't been able to work or to sleep.
- And there's been shit all over this place for days.
- "Shit"?
- What?
- You mean the package?
It busted?
Busted?
Yeah.
Yeah, you could say that.
- Well, did you put the shit back?
- Put it back?
No, we had it bronzed for posterity.
What do you think we did?
Michael.
Her next bottle's in 45 minutes.
I made it up already.
It's in the basket.
- It's a baby.
- You're sharp, aren't ya?
He's all right, huh?
Twenty minutes after she eats, she gets tired.
Put her to bed.
- And I'm getting you a can of powdered milk.
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Right.
Powdered milk.
Right.
- Yeah, powdered milk.
So, all right, so we'll take the "powdered milk" and, uh, we'll get out of here.
What, you want us to take the baby?
That was the arrangement.
- Are you sure that's the plan?
- You're damn straight.
Well, if you say so.
Let's go.
- You won't forget what we said?
- No.
And she likes to be rocked to sleep.
Gently.
Gently.
Absolutely.
Gently.
I-I can handle it.
Maybe you should leave a phone number, in case you need some advice.
Oh, uh, I'll call you.
Do you hear that, Peter?
Just listen.
Isn't it wonderful?
- Isn't what wonderful?
- Quiet.
Peace and quiet.
There's something screwy going on, Michael.
I got a funny feeling.
What are you talking about?
You've been tense the last five days.
It's just your nerves unwinding.
Maybe you're right.
Michael.
- Michael, what is this?
- A package.
- When did it get here?
- Sunday.
- Mrs Hathaway br--
- Go to the window.
See if you can stop them.
I gotta try and catch up with them!
Hi.
Hello.
Yeah, you're beautiful.
Come on.
Wanna go for a ride?
Hey!
Hey, up here!
- Where am I gonna put this little baby?
- Right on your lap.
Huh?
No, we need a little baby car seat, I think.
- Put her in the trunk.
- Yeah?
You wanna go for a ride in the car, in the trunk?
Huh?
Wanna go in the trunk?
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
Hey, hey.
You wanna try this?
It's an adventure.
Why am I listening to you?
Why-
- Why do I listen to you?
I mean, this is absurd.
I can't put a little baby in the trunk.
- Hey!
- It's okay.
Yeah.
- Oh, Mr Wonderful.
- Hey!
-Yeah?
-Look, uh, I gave you the wrong package.
- W-W-What wrong package?
What are you talking--
- I made a-
- I made a terrible mistake.
I gave you the wrong package.
Look, I've got-
- Give me the baby first.
- No.
Hey, no-
- Take it easy.
Be gentle.
- Give me the-
- Give me the baby first.
- Give me the baby.
Give me the baby.
- Be gentle.
You're disturbing the baby.
- Hey, hey, hey, what are you, crazy?
- Give me the baby first.
- Look, hey, Satch.
Hey, listen, this guy's an animal.
- Give me the baby!
Please!
I keep him chained to the wall.
I feed him raw meat.
- Hey!
What's goin' on here?
- Oh, God, it's Roy and Trigger.
- I said, what's goin' on here?
- Nothing, Officer.
- You gonna ride with that kid in the trunk?
- No!
Of course not.
That's absurd.
I mean, it's unhealthy for the child, and it's illegal also, I understand.
- No, he's not, Officer.
Give me the baby.
- Yeah--
- All right, let me see your licence and registration.
- Why?
- Why?
- Yeah, why?
- 'Cause you're double-parked, wise guy!
- Oh.
Why-
- All right.
Wait a minute.
What's--
- Give me the baby.
Just be gentle.
Be gentle.
Be gentle.
- Hey.
Stay there.
- One second, Officer.
I'll be right with you.
Book!
Book!
Book!
Book!
Hey, come back here!
You, freeze!
I have no intention of moving, Officer.
I'm not a criminal, I'm an architect.
- W-With a baby.
See?
- Ah, let me see some I.D.
Oh, yeah, sure.
- I don't have any with me.
- Up against the car.
Spread 'em.
Uh, Officer, look, uh, uh, my wallet's up in my apartment.
It's right up there.
You can come up with me.
You're welcome to.
Uh, uh, I-I'll some you some I.D, but I'm not gonna spread 'em because I have a baby, as you can plainly see.
All right, architect, let's go.
Here we are.
Come on in.
Can I get you a cup of coffee or something?
No, thanks.
I'll just wait here by the door.
Michael!
I'll just be a second.
Come with me, Michael.
Here we go.
I'm coming.
Uh, just listen.
The package those guys came for is full of drugs.
- What?
- Drugs.
All right, here.
- Coming.
Do something with it.
- Like what?
Hide it.
I gotta show him some I.D. I'm coming.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
There you are.
- Would you mind removing that from the cover, please?
- Well, sure.
- Thank you.
Shh, shh.
Shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh.
Shh.
Sure.
Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
Thanks for coming up, Officer.
I hope it hasn't been an inconvenience.
And if there's anything else I can do for you, just let me know.
I was just doin' my job.
Hi.
I'm Detective Sergeant Melkowitz, Narcotics.
Officer, you can go down and saddle up now.
- Yes, sir.
- I'll handle this.
Aren't you gonna ask me in?
Can I, uh, get you a cup of coffee, some water, a beer?
No, no.
No, thanks, I'm fine.
Ah.
- You don't mind me asking a few questions, do you?
- No, not at all.
- Is that your baby I saw you with downstairs?
- No.
Uh, well, um, it's my roommate Jack's.
Well, who were those two men I saw you talking to?
Friends.
Of the mother's.
They were gonna take her for a ride.
The baby!
Baby.
Not the mother.
But they couldn't, see, because they brought the wrong car.
There's no baby seat.
Well, do you mind if I have a look at that baby?
I just love little babies.
She's sleeping.
Sounds like she's awake to me.
Do you mind if I see her?
I don't know.
You know, she doesn't really like strangers.
- She may not be decent.
- Oh, I don't think she'll mind.
Well, there she is.
And she's got a friend.
Oh, yeah, this is my, uh, other roommate.
Uh, Detective Melkowitz, this is Michael Kellam.
- Hello.
- Oh, what a cutie.
Do you mind if I hold her?
I just love kids.
Well, I'd rather not, actually.
She's, um--
- Go ahead, Michael.
It won't hurt her.
- Uh, well, you know how she is around people, Peter.
She's so--
Michael, will you let him hold her.
He's not gonna hurt her.
He's a police officer.
- All right.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
Oh.
Oh.
You're a heavy little girl, aren't you?
Yes.
Yes, she really is heavy, isn't she?
- She's a good eater.
- Yeah.
That's a good sign.
It means she won't grow up to be a nervous adult.
You've got nothing to be nervous about, have you, sweetie?
- Feels as though she's ready for a change.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
- Oh.
You know babies.
- Yep.
- All they do is eat, sleep and poop.
- Here, Michael.
- Yeah, I'll take her.
- Good idea.
Oh, what a cute little baby.
Uh, do you happen to know where her father is at the moment?
- No.
Uh, yeah, he's on location, uh, doing a TV movie.
- Huh?
- But I-I don't have any idea where.
- Uh, do you know this guy?
Oh, not very well.
He's a friend of Jack's.
Uh, I don't remember his name.
His name is Paul Milner.
He directs TV commercials.
And on the side, he just happens to dabble in a little heroin smuggling.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I don't know him.
I don't--
I'd appreciate that glass of water now, Mr Mitchell.
- Of course.
No problem.
- Thank you.
I got it.
- Hi, this is Peter...
- Michael...
- and Jack.
- We're out playing and we can't come to the phone--
- But we'll call you back.
- Shit!
- So please leave a message at the sound of the tone.
- Hold on.
Whoever it is, I'm here.
- Uh, Peter!
Jack.
Yeah, how are you?
L-Listen, uh, I got a message saying you're trying to get through to me.
What's up?
Jack, Michael and I really have to talk to you, but, uh, uh, you called us at a bad time.
We'll call back later.
Wh-whoa, wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
Don't hang up.
I'm calling from Turkey.
It took me an hour to put this call through.
It's not an easy place to phone from, you know.
Hey, Peter, this place is amazing.
You will not believe some of the stuff I bought for you guys.
-Jack!
- I mean, the shit is so cheap here.
I probably bought too much of it, but what the hell, I can always smuggle it in.
-Just kidding.
-Jack, thanks for calling.
Uh, and we'll see you when you get back.
I gotta get him a glass of water so his mouth doesn't go dry when he reads me my rights.
- Here you are, Sergeant.
- Oh, thanks.
Goodbye.
Nice talking to you.
It was very illuminating.
- He heard the phone call.
- We're dead.
- You think Jack's involved in this?
- I don't know.
We gotta talk to Paul Milner.
- Why him?
- Because he is involved.
Couldn't you think of somewhere better to hide the drugs?
Hey, it was perfect until you insisted that he hold the baby.
All right, you're right, Michael.
I'm sorry.
Where'd you put 'em now?
In the garbage pail under the other dirty diapers.
Nobody's gonna look for it there.
You realize we're in trouble with this cop.
You realize, of course, that no one's coming back to get this kid.
- ...is not in service.
-Jesus, you're right.
We're stuck with her until Jack gets back.
It's disconnected.
- Oh, I'm late.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute, so am I.
Oh, damn it.
Mr Kellam?
Mr Mitchell?
- Hello, Mrs Hathaway.
- Oh, Mr Mitchell.
It seems that a horse has befouled the front walk.
Do you know anything about it?
- Mrs Hathaway, how nice to see you.
- Really nice to see you.
Oh.
- She can sit till 5:00.
- Well, I'll try and hurry.
Me too.
I'm worried.
- I got the one with the mustache.
- I'll call Sergeant Melkowitz and tell him we're moving.
Right.
There.
Here you go, pal.
What can I do for ya?
I'd like, uh, Sports Illustrated, Popular Science, some of this gum... and that giraffe up there.
- Which one's the giraffe?
- The rubber one.
That's not a giraffe.
That's a dinosaur.
- Whatever.
- You mean the one with the little polka dots up there?
- Yes, uh, thank you.
- That's a dinosaur.
A giraffe has big ears.
- I don't care whether it has ears or not.Just give me the damn thing.
- It's got little ears.
It's a dinosaur.
- Hey, what about your change?
- Never mind.
- What about your change, pal?
He left at 4:00.
He'll be back on Thursday.
Mrs Hathaway.
Mrs Hathaway, I'm home.

Mary?
Oh, my God.

Thank God.
Thank God.
No, everything's fine, darling.
Everything's fine.
Don't you worry.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
No.
It's okay.
Peter?
Peter!
She's okay.
She's not hurt.
- How are you?
- I'm fine.Just--
See what those bastards did to my videotapes?
We got a message.
What'd it say?
"Next time we'll take the baby."
- It's okay.
It's okay.
- Mr Kellam.
Mr Mitchell!
"The champ caught Smith with a savage left hook...
"that sent the challenger crashing into the ropes.
"Smith, his left eye swollen and the cut above his right eye now much more bloody... countered with a barrage of vicious body blows."
- What are you reading her?
- It doesn't matter what I read.
It's the tone you use.
She doesn't understand the words anyway.
Now, where were we?
"The champ began the fifth round...
"like a man possessed...
"going straight for his opponent's body... with ferocious energy."
Here you go, darlin'.
Stupid-
- I can't believe--
My face!
Watch out for my face!
Peter, it's me,Jack!
-Jack!
-Jesus,Jack!
- Get up!
- No, wait--
- W-What are you-
- Get him off!
- You irresponsible-
- Come here!
- What is it with you guys?
- We should be asking you that question!
- Why?
What'd I do?
- What the hell are you doing back so soon anyway?
- My part got cut.
Okay?
- Good!
What is with him?
Wh--Je--
Look at this place.
Will somebody please tell me what the hell is goin' on around here?
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit!
What was that?
No, I'm not goin' anywhere until you tell me what's goin' on.
- We'll be glad to.
- That really hurt, Peter.
- Ow, ow, ow.
- Sunday morning I come back from jogging... to find this basket with this baby in it waiting in the vestibule.
- Well, why--
- Inside is a little note from a Sylvia... saying that the baby was yours and she was leaving it here for you to deal with it.
- M-Mine?
- Then along comes another little package with your name on it... only this time the package has heroin in it... and the narcotics squad permanently camped downstairs knows all about it.
The cops?
I don't believe this.
I don't know anything about any drugs or any police.
I mean, I thought I was just doing a favour for Paul.
I didn't know what was in that package.
And I certainly don't know anything about that baby.
I mean, for God's sake, somebody drops a baby off on, on your doorstep, and you automatically assume he's mine?
Look, the child doesn't look anything like me.
I'm bigger and, and I have more hair.
"Dear Jack, Here is our baby.
I can't handle this now.
I don't know where else to turn.
S--"
Sylvia?
Oh, my--
Oh, my God.
Stratford.
Ayear and a ha--
Ayear and a half ago.
I was doing Taming of the Shrew.
She was the shrew.
I mean, I did some of my best work in that.
- I got great reviews.
-Jack, you're such a jerk.
- You're always thinkin' about yourself.
I wanna kill you.
- Michael, you won't have to.
Jack, I would like to introduce you to your daughter Mary.
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, you guys.
You can't be sure that this is my kid.
Uh-
- Um--
- What the hell am I supposed to do with it?
- We've put our lives on hold,Jack, taking care of this kid... and now it's your turn.
Okay.
All right.
All right, fine.
All right, until I straighten this mess out, I'll, uh, I'll take care of her.
I mean, sure, why not?
I'm an actor.
I can, uh, I can do a father.
Yeah.
Yeah.
See, huh?
What could be so difficult, huh?
Yeah.
- Goodnight,Jack.
- Goodnight,Jack.
- Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Oh.
Down we go.
W-W-Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What-What's the matter with her?
- Goodnight,Jack.
- Goodnight,Jack.
Hold still, kid.
Gee-
- Hey, how do you put on these goddam things anyway?
Figure it out for yourself, dickhead.
- Nice shot.
- Look at that stuff.
Oh, my God!
What are you guys feeding her, huh?
Oh, no, no, please!
Not on the silk sheets.
Not on the silk sheets.
Please, please!
Maybe I should show him how to put on the diaper.
Oh, no.
I don't believe this.
Why me?
Oh, come on, baby.
Nope.
Let's give him another half hour.
Let him suffer.
Yes, yes, I'm trying to reach Paul Milner.
No, he was supposed to be in San Francisco, but I can't find him.
Wo-Would you please tell him to call Jack Holden as soon as he gets in?
- Is this urgent?
- Yeah, urgent's an understatement.
Lady.
I don't know why I bother giving you this.
It just goes right through you.
- Did you get a hold of your friend?
- No.
- Don't forget to bolt the door.
- I won't.
And remember, there's a quarter of a million dollars in heroin in that diaper pail.
- And the new baby wipes are in the cabinet.
- Right.
Heroin's in the diaper pail.
Baby wipes are in the cabinet.
Where else would they be?
I can't believe this.
You're kidding me.
Thirty-two Benningtons i-in the London area?
Yes, sir.
Uh, uh, uh, I'll get back to you.
I-I--
Oh, boy.
Oh, baby.
Look, I-I know.
I know.
I know.
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
Oh, God.
Y-Yeah.
Well, we tried your mommy.
Maybe I should, uh--
Maybe I should try mine, huh?
Yeah.
Mom?
- Well, where is she?
- Oh, Mom, wait till you see her.
Oh, you won't believe this.
She is so beautiful.
She looks just like you.
- You know, you boys live like pigs.
- Oh, Mom.
Look, look.
There.
Isn't she beautiful?
There she is.
Look at that little baby!
- Yeah.
- You're such a pretty little girl.
Will you come to me?
I'm gonna pick you right up.
- Yes, I'm gonna pick you right up.
- Oh, I am in awe.
I mean, look at you.
You-You pick her up like a pro.
I pick her up like a grandmother.
It's called experience.
Darling.
Let's see you.
Oh, she's so lovely.
What's her name?
- Mary.
- Mary.
Well, Mary!
Look at the way she's looking at me.
-For a moment there, I had her laughing.
-Yeah, just like me, huh?
Don't ruin this for me,Jack.
- Oh!
- Oh, she adores you!
- You-
- Well, well, well.
- She knows that you're her grandmother.
It's like a-
- It's like a biological thing, an instant connection.
Cut the crap,Jack.
What do you want?
Mom, I can't take care of her.
I don't know what to do.
I was kinda hoping that-- that maybe you could take her, just for a little while.
Not forever.
You know, until she's ready to vote.
Oh, I would love to.
Do you know,Jack?
Some people live all their lives... without having anything as wonderful as this to show for it?
- I know, Mom.
- So I'm gonna do the most wonderful thing in the world for you.
Absolutely nothing.
Why?
Jack, you've always run away from responsibility.
Now you have to turn and face it.
Mom, I'm a screw-up.
You were a screw-up.
Now you're a father.
And you'll be a fine one.
- You think so?
- I know it.
Your father, God rest his soul... he was a screw-up and he turned out just fine.
- Really?
- Don't you remember?
- Well, yeah, I guess.
- Now, give me a kiss.
Mary, give me a kiss.
And now, you and your friends clean this place up.
If not for yourselves, do it for my granddaughter.
- We-We will.
We will.
- Bye.
Bye.
Thanks anyway, Mom.
Well, looks like it's just you and me now, kid.
What?
Mama.
Oh,Jack?
There's four bottles prepared already.
So you should be fine till tomorrow morning.
And if her bottom gets red, you just give her a bottle of water.
Works miracles.
In about three hours, white as marble.
We'll be in seats D-1 1 , 1 2, 1 3 and 1 4.
Yeah, if there's a problem, just call.
The usher will come and get us.
Oh!
Here's the number.
- Wait a minute.
Are you leaving right now?
- Yeah, now.
- When are you coming back?
- About midnight.
All right.
Don't worry about us.
Wait a minute.
Is this a four?
Yeah, it's a four.
It's good to have.
So, uh, what do you want to do?
You know, this show's been running longer than Mary's been alive?
Peter, we agreed not to mention her name tonight, right?
- Right.
My mistake.
- Who did you guys con into sitting for you?
-Jack.
-Jack?
Daddy?
Patty.
Are you hungry?
Huh?
Well, we're in luck here.
Uh, oh-ho-ho!
Tonight, uh, the chef has, uh... cooked up something very special for you.
He has taken the juice of one cow... and, uh, sauteed it, uh, with a fine sauce.
It is, uh, presented surrounded by a bottle... and topped off, uh, with a delicious rubber nipple, huh?
Oh-ho.
Yes.
Oh, excellent choice.
Yes, yes.
Here we go.
Oh, yes.
Wh-What?
Here you go.
Come on.
Please?
You don't want it, huh?
Yeah, I just changed you.
Huh?
And you're not hungry.
What else is there in life?
I always wanted to be a musical comedy star.
- Did you ever try?
- No.
Ladies and gentlemen, act two will begin in three minutes.
Three minutes.
Michael, have you ever done any acting?
No.
No, I leave that to Jack.
The idiot.
I got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside I've got the month of May
I guess you say
What can make me feel this way My girl
But maybe he fell asleep.
Maybe he fell and hit his head.
He's probably unconscious.
- Will you come on?
It's started.
- It's terrible, terrible.
- I had a great time.
- I'll see you at P.J.'s later.
Oh, you can sing us a song from the second act, okay?
Are they always this strange?
Yes, since they got involved with another woman.
Wasn't that fun, huh?
Yeah.
Oh, cover that.
-Jack?
-Jack, where are you?
-Jack!
- I'm right here.
What?
What?
- What are you doing?
- Well, what's it look like I'm doing, Peter?
- Is everything all right?
- Everything's fine, yeah.
Why you guys back so soon anyway, huh?
Uh, we thought that we might have left the stove on.
No, no.
The stove's not on.
I think that Uncle Peter and Uncle Michael are having a nervous breakdown, yes.
I called,Jack.
I let the phone ring for five minutes.
- Why didn't you answer the phone?
- Well, because Mary and I were taking a shower.
Weren't we?
Yeah, we didn't hear anything.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Isn't that the truth, mademoiselle?
Yes.
Oh, you are cute, yes.
I never put a phone in a shower before.
- You get many calls in here?
- A steady stream.
- What if you slipped down there?
- Well, I did try.
- We did pretty well for the first time out.
- Yeah.
- Here.
- What?
"Commercial director hospitalized after mugging."
- What?
- Yeah, take a look at this.
This is your friend, Paul Milner.
"Don't let this happen to you.
"Be at the phone booth at the corner of 81 st and Columbus... at exactly 8:00 p.m. tonight."
They're trying to intimidate us.
I hate that.
- I've had enough of this doo-doo.
- I want to finish this, okay?
Hello?
Yeah, we got your message.
Uh-uh.
No good.
We do it our way.
Because we got the stuff, and if you don't do it our way--
- Come on.
- Say it, say it.
We flush it down the toilet!
Okay, now listen, and listen good.
There's a-- a construction site.
Car 20 following suspects, southbound Central Park West.
Come on, Peter!
- Damn it,Joe!
We lost 'em!
- I got it.
Three blocks, turn around.
That was great.
That was great.
Everybody remember what they're supposed to do?
Oh, come on, Peter.
It's not that complicated a plan.
Yeah, next he's gonna want us to synchronize our watches, right?
Should we do that?
Yes, thank you.
Hello, Sergeant Melkowitz.
Uh, my name is Jack Holden.
I think you know my two roommates.
I must have been crazy to agree to this.
Goddam.
- Orange elevator.
Here it is.
- Right.
Close door.
- Okay, 1 5, please.
- Fifteen?
Yeah.
I'm all filthy and everything.
What's wrong, my sweetheart?
Come here.
What is it, huh?
Sweetie.
Oh.
Well, you should have told me before we left.
Oh, boy, this is not a-- this is not a good time to do this.
Hold still.
Oh, you make such a-- There you go.
Michael.
They're here.
- Hey, look.
Hey, you know, this is really aggravating.
- I'm here.
- I'm here by the pipes.
- You know, I don't have a lot of time, but, uh--
- Hold it.
- What, what, what?
- Hold it!
All right, just hold it.
Look, where is the stuff?
Will you give it to me?
- It's in the elevator.
- Oh, bullshit.
Uh, i-it's in the control panel.
Uh, check for yourself.
What am I supposed to do, bring my handy little tool kit here?
You realize that, uh... we had absolutely nothing to do with this.
We had no idea what was in the package.
Yeah, no kidding.
I mean, I could have figured that out in about four seconds.
I mean, you know, you guys don't behave like a couple of pros.
- You know what I mean?
- Right.
- Yeah.
- We're not pros.
- I just said that, didn't I?
I'm sensitive to that.
I mean, why do you make it so complicated?
- We've never done this.
- I got it.
- Great.
You're forgiven this time.
Very wise of you to cooperate, finally.
- Glad it's over.
- No-No happier than I am, believe me.
I mean, dealing with, uh, amateurs is a real pain in the ass.
- So is dealing with professionals.
- No doubt.
Hey, what is that?
- What, are you abusing my trust here or what?
- Whoa!
- There's someone in there!
- Come on.
Come on, Michael.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, look-- look out.
- I lost my balance.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I got it!
- We got 'em!
Who's doing this?
Huh?
I want that camera, punk!
- There's six switches!
- Aw, these guys wrecked my day.
-Jack!
- What the hell happened?
- He hit the wrong button.
- He what?
- Can it go any faster or what?
- This is it.
- Huh?
Come on.
You punks!
-Jack!
-Jack!
- Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.
I want that home movie.
I'll wait for you.
I want that movie.
- Oh, no.
-Jack!
- Hit the button on the left!
- The button on the left,Jack!
- What?
What?
- Hit the button on the left!
There is no left.
The le--
- Come on, get it going faster, will ya?
Is that it?
- I can't.
Please.
- Hey, why are we stopped?
What's the matter?
Huh?
- I don't understand.
- Why is this elevator stopped?
- What do you want?
It's dead.
The whole thing's no good.
I got 'em!
- It ain't running.
It just ain't running.
- What's going on?
- Did you hit the button?
Jesus.
- Yeah, it's dead.
- Oh, boy.
Uncle Peter and Uncle Michael are gonna be plenty ticked off with Daddy.
- Aren't you glad he's on our side?
- What happened?
What happened?
Can you get--
You wait for me.
I know where you live, man!
- Oh, no, no, Vince.

Why?
Okay.

Oh, thanks for the phone call.
Oh, actually it was, uh, Peter's idea.
Hi, guys.

- Hello, Sergeant.
-The guys you want are in that elevator.
-The drugs are up there too.
- Everything you need to know is right here.
- It's very illuminating.
Oh, thanks.
Thanks a lot.
If I have any questions, I know where to reach you guys.
- Yeah.

Goodnight.
Peter, I'm having a lot of trouble sleeping.
Could you sing to me, please?
All right, so, uh--
Thank you.
Thank you.
Great.
- Good morning.
- Hello.
There you go.
Yes?
I'm Sylvia.
Mary's mother.
I've come to get her.
-Just a minute.
- How is she doing?
She's fine.
She's teething.
That can be rough.
- Can I see her?
- Yeah, sure.
Come on in.
I don't believe how wonderful she looks!
Oh!
Hello, Mary.
Hello, my darling.
It's your mommy.
Yes, it's your mommy.
You're very beautiful.
Your hair is growing.
You've changed so much, and I've missed it.
Mommy has missed you.
Oh, I never thought I'd miss her this much.
Hello!
Hello!
Where's my baby?
Is Jack here?
- I'll get him.
- Mary, look how big you've gotten!
Michael.
Michael.
Sylvia's here.
Mary's leaving.
She looks very happy,Jack.
You've obviously taken good care of her.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have left her the way I did.
I hope it didn't cause too much trouble.
Uh, no, no.
No trouble at all.
Sylvia.
There's something I need to know.
Is she really mine?
Yes.
She is.
So, uh, what are you gonna do now?
Do you-
- Do you have any idea?
I, um--
I'm going home.
I can't work and take care of Mary on my own... so, um... we're going to move in with my family.
They said they'd help.
You're going to London?
Yeah.
When?
Tonight.
- Is that what you really want to do?
- Sorry?
Never mind.
- You pack all the bottles?
- Yeah.
And cans of formula?
- You packed 'em.
- Yeah.
What about the blender?
Maybe we should give her that, to mash up bananas and stuff.
Sure.
And diapers?
You pack extra Pampers?
Yeah.
How can he let her go?
If I were Jack, I would not let her go.
Neither would I, Michael.
Neither would I.
But he's the father.
I don't think he wants her to go... but he just can't admit it.
You know, if you want anything, anything at all, you call us, okay?
She'll probably be hungry in an hour.
She's a real good eater, so, uh--
- Like her daddy.
- Some of this stuff's fragile in here.
- Okay, I got it.
- You know, if she-- if she wakes up in the middle of the night... she likes to be sung to.
'50s and '60s music works best.
- Thanks.
I'll remember that.
- You're all set.
Everything's packed.
If there's anything else you need, just, uh, call us.
- Anything.
Okay?
- Thank you.
Well, maybe, uh--
Here, let me, uh-
- Go ahead.
- Gloucester Hotel, please.
- The Gloucester, okay.

Guys like us shouldn't be raising kids anyway.
Right?
Well, should we?
I suppose not.
She's better off with her mother.
And we are definitely better off now that everything's back to normal.
- Right?
- Whatever you say,Jack.
Right.
So how come I feel so bad?
What'd you say?
How come I feel so bad?
I have this ache right here.
I don't know.
What do you think, Mike?
- It could be the wine.
- It's not the wine.
Well, what is it then?
I don't know.
I wish it would go away.
Maybe it's something you ate.
- Maybe you're not getting enough sleep.
- It's not that.
Then what the hell is it?
I miss Mary.
Okay?
I miss Mary.
I just wish there was something I could do.
Well, maybe there is.
- What?
- When's her flight leaving?
- Yo, taxi!
- Taxi!
- Taxi!
- Taxi!
- Kennedy Airport.
- Yeah, Kennedy.
Kennedy Airport.
- Who you guys chasing?
- My baby girl.
- Her mother's taking her to London.
- Oh, yeah?
How old?
- Se-Seven months.
- Seven months.
- Seven months?
That's hard work.
But pretty soon, they start to walk.
And let me tell you, the first time you hear the word "Daddy"...
I don't care who you are, your heart just melts.
- Can you drive a little faster, please?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
- Good luck to you.
Thanks.
Good luck, guys.

- That's it.
Thank you.
Goodnight.
Sylvia, are you all right?
What happened?
- We thought you'd gone.
- I couldn't go,Jack.
I couldn't do it.
I mean, I don't want to make another mistake.
And I knew if I took her away, I'd just be making another mistake.
I mean, I-I have to work.
I mean, I can't do that and take care of Mary alone.
I mean, do you know what it's like?
A one-room flat, on your feet all day... working or auditioning.
And I'm on the job sometimes until 3:00 in the morning.
- And since Mary gets up at 5:30--
- Oh, I know, I know.
It's awful.
- I mean, you can imagine how much sleep I get.
- Yeah.
A-And after the 5:30 bottle, it starts all over again at 9:00.
And by the time I change her and play with her a little, it's already 8:00.
Well, forget about sleeping after that.
It's impossible.
And then the babysitters until 3:00 in the morning.
All my money is sucked down the tubes.
And me so tired.
I can't take Mary to the park.
Oh, tell me about it.
Gettin' time to take her to the park?
That's a bitch.
- Sit down.
- I mean, I love my job, but...
I sometimes feel like I'm just working to pay the sitters... and I run around all day... and I-I don't get enough sleep.
And what's worse, I don't think I'm taking very good care of Mary.
- No, of course you are.
- I am?
I mean, I couldn't cope.
- Sylvia, we know how hard it is.
- Yeah, there's three of us.
We could hardly manage.
And I don't want to go to London.
I want to work in New York.
But I can't do that alone.
I hope I don't have to.
I need help.
I need someone to help me.
We'll help.
We will help.
- Yes, yes, absolutely.
I mean, you can leave her anytime you want.
- Yes.
Yes.
- We'd love to have her.
- Oh, gosh, yeah.
When you go for an audition or-- or you go shopping, or-- or whatever.
- You want to be by yourself.
- I was hoping you would say that.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- Really?
Oh--
- Thank you so much.
Mary.
- Yeah, of course.
Hold it, guys.
I don't think I like this arrangement.
I just don't want to be Mary's babysitter.
I want-
- We want to be able to see her all the time.
May I?
I-I agree.
So what are you saying?
What do you-
- What do you mean?
I'm saying... that I think Mary should move in with us permanently... that we should be her family.
Well, I-I think it's lovely of you to offer, Peter... but I-I couldn't let Mary--
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- Oh, no, you don't understand.
You're right, Sylvia.
She's-
- She's your daughter.
She needs a full-time mother.
- That's why we think that-- that-- that you should move in too.
- We-
- We--
- Oh, it's a great idea.
Oh, Sylvia.
- Yeah!
- I--
- What do you think?
Come on.
- Of course, it's better than-- Four is better than three.
Uh-
- Do you-
- Do you have room?
I'll build you a room.
I'll build Mary a room.
- That's what he does in life.
- Yeah, that's what he does.
He builds rooms.
- Oh, please, say yes.
- Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!

Is it the penthouse?
Yes, ma'am.
Welcome to another edition of...
"Lifestyles of the average and anxious"
we move about the apartment of Peter Mitchell, young architect about town.
It's his late 30s, or is it his early 40s... we'll never know... birthday party.
Entranced by the euphoria and ease...
These glamorous people exude!
I think I spy the birthday boy himself!
How are you, old chum?
You're looking so well, so well.
Over here is his semi-main squeeze,
Rebecca Davidson.
The public wants to know...
What an attractive, successful woman, sees in a bozo like my roommate.
Well, he's uh...
Charming and he's sweet.
He's very thoughtful.
He's sort of boyishly handsome, but...
He has got the most amazing...
Thank you, Rebecca!
You're welcome, Michael.
So Peter, tell me.
Are you and Rebecca still exclusive?
Me and Rebecca?
We both see other people.
Really?
That's nice to know.
Bye.
Hey, birthday boy.
Hi, Adam.
Rebecca's looking sexier than ever.
Yeah.
You two still together?
Yeah, for 5 years now.
Tight.
Tight as ever.
¶ Good love ¶
¶ good love ¶
¶ good love ¶
James!
Whatever happened to the "young rascals"?
They old.
Real old.
Don't say that.
One of them's a senator now.
Oh, God, no!
Real old!
Can I talk to you a minute?
I'm not doing commercials anymore.
No more talking t-bones, or cowboys with heartburn.
I'm only doing serious stuff now.
Hi.
Jack!
Angela... phew!
You look different.
What happened?
I'm dressed.
That's it!
Gentlemen, I'm in love.
You?
Yeah.
In a generic sense.
Right.
So many women...
So little time.
So, Jack...
What's up?
You're not really going to do this movie in Turkey?
Yes, I am.
I leave in a few short hours.
What is it?
"Zalmon the beautician?"
"Zalmon the barbarian."
What about the play in soho you wanted to do?
Excuse me.
You said it was a once-in- a-lifetime opportunity.
You want my inevitably brilliant reviews, or next month's rent?
Forget about next month's rent.
Do the play.
That's sweet of you.
You are a very decent man.
I'm a goddamn Saint.
"Saint" is a bit much.
Hey, how's it going, baby?
Name's Johnny.
Give me five.
I mean, give me three, yeah.
Yeah.
I can't believe you draw "Johnny cool."
Coolest cat in the world, right?
No one cooler, baby.
I can't believe it.
It makes me so happy.
What's wrong?
David.
The guy you broke up with?
The good looking one.
Incredibly good looking.
He used to read me "Johnny cool" every morning.
Hey, hey.
Poor baby.
Know how to get over a lover?
Dance with a stranger.
David's an incredible dancer.
He studied 3 years with the joffrey ballet.
3 years?
Joffrey ballet?
You guys will get back together.
Could I call him and invite him to the party?
Uh, yeah.
Twins!
There it is!
Yeah!
One of the best clutch shots of all time.
Nobody played better than...
Reed, west, Chamberlain, baylor.
I'll run it for you again in slow motion.
People are asking for you.
Let's go mingle.
"Mingle" sounds like something sea lions do before mating.
You are the guest of honor.
They love you.
But these guys need me.
Don't you?
Go on.
Leave your money.
Wait, there it is.
Yeah!
The greatest clutch shot in basketball history.
Unarguably.
The best.
Paul, listen.
You are my friend and a great director, but I'm not doing commercials ever again.
I don't want you to do a commercial.
I need a favor.
All right, shoot.
I'm having a package delivered tomorrow, but I'm going to San Francisco on a shoot.
You're going to shoot in San Francisco?
Yeah.
Who are you using?
Len Peters.
Lennie?
Didn't you like my last dog food commercial?
That was a classic.
Could I have this package delivered here?
Sure, no problem.
Let me ask you something.
Do you think I'm overexposed?
Overexposed?
No, not at all.
It'll be delivered tomorrow and picked up Thursday.
Tomorrow;
Picked up Thursday.
This is a delicate matter.
Don't mention it.
All right.
Delicate.
¶ Happy Birthday, dear Peter ¶
¶ Happy Birthday to you ¶
Speech!
Speech!
Oh, uh...
First of all,
I want to thank Jack and Michael and Rebecca...
For embarrassing me with this flow of sentiment.
Thanks for coming.
All right.
All right.
I think everybody had a great time.
- Don't you.
- I sure did.
Why don't you stick around a while?
I thought sentiment made you uncomfortable.
I can handle it, mm-hmm.
As long as it's disguised as sex.
Stay tonight.
I can't.
I have to be up at 7 am for a pretrial meeting.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Happy Birthday, Peter.
Mmmm.
Yeah, right.
It was a great party.
You know, in this light...
You're kind of ugly.
That rut in the middle of your forehead...
Is getting out of hand.
Why does that happen to you?
What?
As soon as you get a woman in your room, you turn into her brother and solve her problems.
Unlike you, and our sexually insatiable roommate,
I'm a sensitive guy.
I have more on my mind than pronging chicks.
What's a good year for pronging chicks?
The '82 Bordeaux works every time.
Thank you very much.
Did somebody die here?
Rebecca left early.
Michael saved another doomed relationship.
Post-party depression.
Listen, I'm out of here tomorrow, for 10 weeks.
What do you say I get rid of cherise, we hunker down with a bottle of wine and shoot pool?
I got a better idea.
You two hunker down, and I'll... no, no, no.
Just go have a good time.
Enjoy yourself.
Oh, guys, tough job, but it's gotta be done.
He's unbelievable.
The man is one giant gland.
Jack?
Jack?
He left already, cherise.
I think he took my mousse.
That's our boy.
Thanks, Peter.
See you around.
Yeah.
It's me, Jack.
I'm at the airport, but I forgot to tell you something.
A package is going to be delivered today.
Some guys will pick it up Thursday before noon.
Just put it aside, and don't worry about it.
It's a very delicate matter, so don't tell anybody.
I'll bring you back something from Turkey.
Maybe a drumstick.
See you later.
Bye-bye.
Hi, Harry.
Morning, sir.
Michael?
Get out here.
What is it?
Just get out here.
What?
What's going on?
I don't know.
What?
Oh, okay.
Just look in the hall.
Yeah?
Just look out in the hall.
Okay.
That's a baby.
I know it's a baby.
What's it doing there?
It's sleeping.
Who do you suppose it belongs to?
Peter, there's a note.
All right, I'll just go ahead...
And play along.
"Dear Jack, here is our baby."
Oh, no.
You really don't know anything about this?
I knew it.
I knew this would happen to him sooner or later.
"I can't handle this.
I don't know where to turn."
Right.
"Someday I hope you can both forgive me.
Unbelievable.
Her name is Mary.
Love, Sylvia."
Who's Sylvia?
You need a secretary to keep track of all his women.
He left a message about a package...
Being delivered today.
He said to put it aside and not worry about it.
He said that about a baby?
He takes procreation a little lightly.
What are we supposed to do?
Pick it up.
You pick it up.
I'm not picking it up!
You found it!
One of us has to pick it up.
It's not going to be me.
I don't know anything about babies.
Neither do I.
We've got to do something.
Be my guest.
It's not my responsibility.
It's not mine, either.
Don't yell at me!
It can't be that difficult.
Just feed it.
It'll shut up.
I don't know what babies eat!
Soft stuff.
We were babies once.
What did we eat?
It couldn't have been very good;
I can't remember.
Wait!
Where are you going?
To get baby food.
We can't feed it cake and goat cheese.
What am I supposed to do?
Entertain it.
"Entertain it!"
Entertain it?
How do you entertain a baby?
Hey, junior.
Look at my hands.
Look at this.
It's a glass;
A prism.
Look at those colors.
This is nice;
Expensive.
You don't like that.
How about... oh, look.
It's almost like Japanese origami!
It's a bird!
It's a bird!
No, huh?
I'm getting a headache.
You're giving me a headache.
How about this?
A hairy chest!
Like that?
You want one of these?
Excuse me.
Where can I get a jar of baby food?
3rd aisle to the right.
Right.
They gotta be kidding.
What's happening, baby?
How you doing today?
My name is Johnny.
That's right, but you can call me Mr. Cool.
What's your name?
Haven't I seen you around the neighborhood?
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?
Why can't you talk?
Come on, kid.
Laugh it up.
I'm doing my best.
Excuse me.
Is this a good meal for a baby?
That's for toddlers.
What's a toddler?
11/2 to 2 years.
I need something for a baby.
This is your first?
First what?
Baby.
Yeah.
First and last.
No matter how you prepare, you're never ready.
No, you're not.
What an infant eats...
Can you... can determine its entire future.
That's fascinating, but all I need is food.
That's all.
What's the best selling brand?
That white can.
Great.
This is the best?
No, it's the cheapest.
That's why it sells.
How about this one?
That's good, but it's got iron in it.
Is that bad?
If your baby's allergic to it.
How do you know if she's allergic?
They throw up all over you.
But they throw up even if they're not allergic.
Some babies can't hold anything down.
What about this one?
That's for older babies.
How old is your baby?
About that old.
You don't know how old your baby is?
Yes I do.
Is she teething?
Teething?
Does she cry all night, chew her fist and drool?
All right, I'll take 3 of these, and some of these... thanks for your time.
You've been a source of great distress.
If she's less than 3 months old, you've got to sterilize the nipples.
Here it comes.
Hey!
Look!
I'll give you $10 if you stop crying.
10 bucks, huh?
I'm going to pick you up, now.
There you go, Jr.
Is that better?
How about a little walk?
Wait a minute.
Okay.
Hey, how about this?
No, we're not going to keep crying.
No, no, wait.
¶ Rock-a-bye baby on the tree top ¶
¶ when the bough breaks na-na-na-na-na ¶
¶ something like laughing... ¶¶ come on!
Where the hell is he?
Milking the cows or something?
Look!
No crying.
Hey wait a minute!
You can drive a guy to drink.
No, not you.
You're a cute little thing.
How about:
¶ Hush little baby don't you cry ¶
¶ when Peter gets home, I'm gonna punch him in the eye ¶¶ all right, here we are.
Here we are in my room.
Look around here.
This is nice, huh?
We'll sit down here.
Look!
We're going to watch a little TV.
Yeah, just you and me.
Here you go.
Amuse yourself.
Women are wondering, are they having an orgasm?
Men are worried maybe their penis... whoa, whoa.
No, you don't want to hear that.
We'll have a nice conversation with Uncle Peter...
And let him have some fun.
That's a good idea.
Where the hell have you been?
Oh, hi, Mrs. Hathaway.
Oh, what a darling little baby!
Is it yours?
No, it's not mine.
Mr. Mitchell's?
No, someone loaned it to us.
We're watching her for a while.
What's its name?
Its name is uh, uh, Sylvia.
No, Mary, Mary.
We've had a tough morning, and we're tuckered out.
We have to say good-bye.
Bye-bye, Mrs. Hathaway.
By the way, this package just arrived for you downstairs.
All right, great.
Could I hold her?
I don't think so.
I love babies.
- Oh, yes.
- Tch, tch, tch.
I just love babies.
Unfortunately, Mr. Hathaway and I...
Were never able to have any.
Mr. Hathaway has a low sperm count.
Some guys have all the luck.
Oh, you are a cute little bundle, aren't you?
You do realize she did a doodle?
Yes, you did.
Would you like me to change her?
No, I can do it.
I'm used to it.
Thanks, we've got to go now.
We're gonna say bye-bye, now.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye-bye.
If you ever need a baby-sitter...
All right, thanks.
She's a lovely baby.
Adorable.
This baby hasn't stopped crying.
She did a doodle.
What the hell is that?
Don't tell me.
I don't want to know.
You're gonna know, because she did it.
I had to go 3 places and get 4 kinds of formula.
2 kinds of diapers, bottles, towels, nipples... you have no idea how much crap kids need.
How old is she?
You want me to check her driver's license?
You can tell how old she is by feeling her teeth.
I'm not feeling her teeth!
I'm tired of holding her.
I can't hold her and make her bottle.
I'll hold her.
You check the teeth.
Come on!
I can't feel anything.
What's that mean?
She doesn't have any teeth!
Neither did Gabby Hayes, and he was 90.
We'll give her the stuff for newborns...
And hope she's not allergic.
You've no idea what they can be allergic to.
What's that stench?
Hold her.
Just hold her.
This is a girl.
Should we be doing this?
Just hold her, so I can get the diaper off.
How could something so small...
Create something so disgusting?
Beats the shit out of me.
Hand me the other diaper.
Oh!
Shouldn't we wash her?
We'll wash her later.
Get me the cotton.
Oh!
Here it is.
Just give me a little cotton.
I don't need a package.
Get me the cotton wipies.
This is disgusting.
It's all over and it's sticky.
We're going to need some kind of cleaning fluid.
How about after-shave?
Come on, Michael, just get a diaper.
Oh!
Do these tapes go in front or back?
How am I supposed to know?
These are way too big!
What size did you get?
They're ultra absorbent.
The more absorbent, the better!
Hold her!
She's going crazy.
I don't want to.
Come on, Michael!
You're going to rip it.
I'm not going to rip it.
Yes, you are.
Get me another diaper.
I'll use the tape.
I'll tape it up.
I'm an architect, for Christ's sake.
I build 50-story skyscrapers.
I assemble cities of the future.
I can certainly put together a goddamn diaper.
Take it easy, kid.
There, see?
It's working.
A piece of cake.
Yeah.
Nice job, Pete.
The little insect was just waiting...
For that diaper to fall off.
I think we're in trouble.
I'm going to kill Jack.
I'm going to kill him.
This is the deal.
Michael.
What?
You're going to have to wash where the poop was.
Come on.
All righty.
You're not getting anything off that way.
There you go.
That's clean.
I'll rinse her.
Rinse her a little bit.
There we go.
This is for moisturizing... don't use the baby lotion now.
It says, "prevents chapping."
Just wash her.
I'll put some in just to make sure.
We gotta get some help.
Jack said this is a delicate situation, that we shouldn't tell anybody.
Can you believe him putting us through hell...
To save his precious reputation?
I'm not doing it anymore.
Odds.
You're going to have a headache.
Mary, let me have the pen.
I'm later than usual for the deadline.
Come here.
Okay?
Actually, I don't seem to have them after all.
I must have left them at the office.
I'll get them in the morning.
Right.
Your daddy's a dead man.
Rebecca you're...
I came as soon as I could.
Who are you?
This is jan clopatz;
Peter Mitchell.
How do you do.
Jan is a cellist from Hungary.
He's playing at carnegie hall.
What a thrill.
What's the emergency?
Just come with me.
This is the big emergency.
It's a baby.
Why's that the first thing everybody says?
Of course it's a baby.
It's your baby?
It's not mine.
It's Jack's.
Jack has a baby?
I realize that tends to negate...
Our belief in a benevolent God.
It doesn't look like Jack.
He has more hair.
I'm glad you can joke at a time like this.
She needs to be held.
Babies like to be held.
Where is he?
Jack's in Turkey, which is where I'd be if my baby was in New York.
We're dying here.
Michael doesn't know about babies.
I don't know about babies.
I've got deadlines hanging all over me.
I've been reading books about babies.
I can't figure it out.
It says, "feed every 2 hours."
It takes me 2 hours to get her to eat.
Does it mean 2 hours from when I start or finish?
I've been feeding her from when I start, and I'm feeding her all the time.
Which is it?
Why are you asking me?
You're a woman.
That doesn't mean I know about babies.
Rebecca... please stay with me, and help me take care of her.
You want me to take care of her?
Yes.
Now?
No, when she graduates from college.
Yes, now.
I can't do that.
Baby take ...
Very, very much work.
Thanks for telling me.
Is he an idiot savant?
Rebecca, we be late.
Rebecca...
Rebecca, please.
Stay with me.
I have got a date!
Oh?
Excuse me for cramping your romantic style.
Rebecca, we be late!
You can't be serious about him.
You go out with other people;
So do I.
I don't care if you date the whole string section.
Right now, I need you.
I can't be here now.
Oh, she doodled!
Doodled.
Yes, doodled!
Don't babies doodle in Hungary?
We're leaving.
Rebecca!
Wait.
Come on, Rebecca.
Don't go.
You're a very big boy.
You're very capable.
You'll get through this fine.
I hate the cello!
Don't.
I keep waiting for "candid camera"...
To walk through the door.
What'd you cancel for tonight?
Box seats at shea.
You?
Dinner with Cheryl.
Two more days.
Where'd you put the baby powder?
I'll get it.
Why'd you put it there?
We're bathing her in here.
It's just down the hall.
We don't bathe her there.
Maybe we should start, goddamn it!
You're going to clean that up.
What time are they getting here?
Before noon.
Good.
I see my editor about 1:00.
Did you move my blueprints?
I need them.
Sorry.
I think she did a doodle.
Your turn to change her.
I'll give you $1000 if you'll do it.
Check this out.
Coming.
Does Jack holden live here?
Someone asked us to pick up a package.
A package?
I love the way everyone calls it a package.
Tell Sylvia she's got a lot of nerve dumping her problems in our laps.
- Who's Sylvia?
- When she first got here, we considered calling the cops.
Wait, wait, wait.
...totally disrupted our lives.
We haven't worked or slept.
There's been shit all over the place.
Shit?
What?
The package busted?
Busted?
You could say that.
Did you put the shit back?
No, we had it bronzed for posterity.
Michael.
Her next bottle is in 45 minutes.
It's in the basket.
It's a baby.
You're sharp, aren't you?
20 minutes after eating she gets tired.
Put her to bed.
I'll get the powdered milk.
Oh, yeah.
Right, powdered milk.
Yeah, powdered milk.
We'll take the "powdered milk" and get out of here.
You want us to take the baby?
That was the arrangement.
Are you sure?
You're damn straight.
If you say so.
Let's go.
You won't forget what we said?
No.
She likes to be rocked to sleep.
Gently.
Gently.
Absolutely.
I can handle it.
Leave your phone number, in case you need advice.
I'll call you.
Do you hear that, Peter?
Just listen.
Isn't it wonderful?
Isn't what wonderful?
Quiet.
Peace and quiet.
Something screwy is going on.
I've got a funny feeling.
You've been tense the last 5 days.
It's just your nerves unwinding.
Maybe you're right.
Michael...
What is this?
A package.
When did it get here?
Sunday.
Mrs. Hathaway... go to the window.
Stop them.
I'll catch up with them.
You're beautiful.
Want to go for a ride?
Hey, up here!
Where will I put her?
On your lap.
We need a baby car seat.
Put her in the trunk.
You want to ride in the trunk?
Want to go in the trunk?
Umph!
Oh, no.
Oh, my God!
Want to try this?
It's an adventure.
Why do I listen to you?
It's absurd to put a baby in the trunk.
Hey!
Wonderful.
I gave you the wrong package.
I made a terrible mistake.
I gave you the wrong package.
Give me the baby first.
Give me the baby!
You're disturbing the baby.
Give me the baby.
Hey, satch.
This guy's an animal.
I keep him chained and feed him raw meat.
What's going on?
It's Roy and trigger.
What's going on?
Nothing, officer.
You putting the kid in the trunk?
No, it's unhealthy and it's illegal, also.
No, he's not, officer.
Let me see your license and registration.
Why?
You're double-parked, wise guy!
All right.
Wait a minute.
Be gentle.
I'll be right with you.
Come back here!
You, freeze!
I have no intention of moving.
I'm not a criminal.
I'm an architect with a baby, see?
Let me see some I.D.
I don't have any with me.
Up against the car, spread 'em.
My wallet's in my apartment.
You can come up with me.
I'll show you some I.D., but I won't spread 'em because I have a baby.
Let's go, architect.
Here we are.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
No thanks.
I'll just wait here.
I'll just be a second.
Come with me, Michael.
Here we go.
I'm coming.
The package those guys came for...
Is full of drugs.
What?
Drugs!
Here.
Coming.
Do something with it.
Like what?
Hide it!
I'm coming.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Remove that from the cover, please.
Sure.
Thank you.
Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
Shhh.
Shhh.
Thanks for coming up, officer.
If there's anything else I can do, let me know.
I was just doing my job.
Hi.
I'm detective sergeant melkowitz, narcotics.
Officer, you can saddle up now.
I'll handle this.
Aren't you going to ask me in?
Can I get you a cup of coffee, water, beer?
Thanks, I'm fine.
You don't mind me asking a few questions?
No, not at all.
Is that your baby I saw downstairs?
No, it's my roommate Jack's.
Who were those 2 men you were talking to?
Friends...
Of the mother's.
They were going to take her for a ride.
The baby, not the mother.
They couldn't because the car...
Had no baby seat.
Mind if I have a look at that baby?
I just love little babies.
She's sleeping.
Sounds like she's awake.
Mind if I see her?
She doesn't like strangers.
She may not be decent.
I don't think she'll mind.
There she is, and she's got a friend.
This is my other roommate.
Detective melkowitz, Michael kellam.
Hello.
What a cutie.
Mind if I hold her?
I just love kids.
I'd rather not.
Go ahead.
It won't hurt.
You know how she is around people.
Let him hold her.
He won't hurt her.
He's a police officer.
All right.
Ohhh.
You're a heavy little girl, aren't you?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
She really is heavy, isn't she?
She's a good eater.
Good.
It means she won't grow up to be nervous.
You've got nothing to be nervous about, sweetie.
She's ready for a change.
Oh!
You know babies;
Eat, sleep, and poop.
- I'll change her.
- Good idea.
What a cute little baby.
Do you know where her father is?
No.
He's on location doing a TV movie, but I have no idea where.
Do you know this guy?
Not very well.
He's a friend of Jack's.
I don't remember his name.
He's Paul milner.
He directs TV commercials.
On the side, he dabbles in heroin smuggling.
Really?
Yeah.
I don't know him.
I'd appreciate that glass of water now.
Of course.
No problem.
Thank you.
I've got it.
Hi, this is Peter, Michael, and Jack.
We're out playing.
Shit!
Whoever it is, I'm here.
Peter?
Jack.
How are you?
I got a message that you were trying to reach me.
Michael and I really have to talk to you, but you called us at a bad time.
We'll call back later.
I'm calling from Turkey.
It took me an hour to get through.
It's not an easy place to phone from.
This place is amazing.
You will not believe the stuff I bought for you.
This shit is so cheap here.
I probably bought too much, but I can always smuggle it in.
Ha, ha.
I was kidding.
Thanks for calling.
We'll see you when you get back.
Oh!
I gotta get him a glass of water, so his mouth isn't dry when he reads me my rights.
Here you are, sergeant.
Thanks.
Good-bye.
Nice talking to you.
It was very illuminating.
He heard the phone call.
We're dead.
You think Jack's involved?
I don't know.
We gotta talk to Paul milner.
Why?
He is involved.
Couldn't you think of somewhere better to hide the drugs?
It was perfect until you insisted that he hold the baby.
I'm sorry.
Where'd you put 'em now?
In the garbage pail under the dirty diapers.
Nobody's gonna look for it there.
You realize we're in trouble with this cop?
You realize that no one's coming back for this kid?
Jesus, you're right.
We're stuck with her 'til Jack gets back.
This is disconnected.
Oh, I'm late.
Wait a minute.
So am I.
Oh, damn it.
Mr. Kellam?
Mr. Mitchell?
Hello, Mrs. Hathaway.
It seems that a horse...
Has befouled the front walk.
Do you know anything about it?
Mrs. Hathaway, how nice to see you.
Really nice to see you.
Oh.
She can sit 'til 5 P.M. I'll hurry.
Me, too.
I'm worried.
I got the one with the moustache.
I'll tell melkowitz we're moving.
There.
There you go, pal.
What can I do for ya?
I'd like "sports illustrated", "popular science,"
some gum and that giraffe up there.
Which one's the giraffe?
The rubber one.
That's not a giraffe, that's a dinosaur.
Whatever.
The one with the polka dots?
Yeah, that's it.
That's a dinosaur, not a giraffe.
I don't care.
Just gimme the damn thing.
What about your change?
Never mind.
Mrs. Hathaway, I'm home.
Mrs. Hathaway!
Mrs. Hathaway, where's Mary?
I don't know.
Mary?
Oh, my God.
Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
Thank God.
Thank God.
No, everything's fine, darling.
Everything's fine.
Don't you worry.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
No, it's okay.
Peter!
Peter!
She's okay.
She's not hurt.
How are you?
I'm fine, just fine.
Did you see what those bastards did to my videotapes?
We got a message.
What'd it say?
"Next time, we'll take the baby."
It's okay.
It's okay.
Mr. Kellam?
Mr. Mitchell?
"The champ caught Smith with a savage left hook...
"That sent the challenger crashing into the ropes.
"Smith, his left eye swollen,
"and the cut above his right eye now much more bloody, countered with a barrage of vicious body blows."
What are you reading her?
It doesn't matter what I read, it's the tone you use.
She doesn't understand the words, anyway.
Now, where were we?
"The champ began the 5th round like a man possessed,
"going straight for his opponent's body...
With ferocious energy."
Ooohhh!
Jeez!
My face!
Watch out for my face!
Peter!
It's me, Jack!
Jack!
Jesus, Jack!
Jack!
No, wait.
Get him off me.
You irresponsible... what is it with you guys!
We should be asking you that question.
What'd I do?
What the hell are you doing back so soon anyway?
- My part got cut, okay?
- Good!
What is with him?
Look at this place.
What the hell is going on around here?
Aw, shit!
What was that?
I'm not going anywhere...
'Til you tell me what's going on.
We'll be glad to.
That really hurt, Peter.
Ow, ow, ow.
Sunday morning, I come back from jogging...
To find this basket, with this baby in it...
Waiting in the vestibule.
Wha..., what?
Inside is a note from Sylvia saying the baby was yours, and she was leaving it here for you to deal with.
Mine?
Then, along comes another package with your name on it.
Only this time, the package has heroin in it, and the narcotics squad, camped downstairs, knows all about it.
The cops?
I don't believe this.
I don't know anything about any drugs or any police.
I thought I was just doing a favor for Paul.
I didn't know what was in that package.
I certainly don't know anything about that baby.
Somebody drops a baby off, and you assume he's mine?
The child doesn't look anything like me.
I'm bigger...
And I have more hair.
"Dear Jack, here's our baby.
I can't handle this now.
I don't know where else to turn."
"Sylvia."
Oh, my God!
Stratford.
A year and a half ago...
I was doing "taming of the shrew."
She was the shrew.
I did some of my best work in that.
I got great reviews.
Jack, you're such a jerk.
You're always thinking about yourself.
I want to kill you.
Michael, we won't have to.
Jack, I would like to introduce you to your daughter, Mary.
Wait a minute.
You can't be sure this is my kid.
Uh, uh... what the hell am I supposed to do with it?
We've put our lives on hold, Jack, taking care of this kid.
Now, it's your turn.
Okay, all right.
Fine.
Until I straighten this mess out,
I'll take care of her.
Why not?
I'm an actor.
I can do a father.
Yeah.
What can be so difficult?
Good night, Jack.
Good night.
Oh, down we go.
Wait a minute!
What's the matter with her?
Good night, Jack.
Good night, Jack.
Hold still, kid.
Jeez.
How do you put on these goddamn things, anyway?
Figure it out for yourself, dickhead.
Nice shot.
Look at that stuff!
Oh, my God.
What are you guys feeding her, huh?
Oh, no, not on the silk sheets!
Not on the silk sheets!
Maybe I should show him how to put on the diaper.
Oh, no.
I don't believe this.
Why me?
Please!
Come on, baby!
Nope.
Let's give him another half hour.
Let him suffer.
Yes, yes.
I'm trying to reach Paul milner.
No, he was supposed to be in San Francisco, but I can't find him.
Please tell him to call Jack holden as soon as he gets in.
Is this urgent?
Yeah, "urgent's" an understatement...
Lady.
I don't know why I bother to give you this.
It just goes right through you.
Did you get ahold of your friend?
No.
Don't forget to bolt the door.
I won't.
Remember, there's $250,000 in heroin in that diaper pail.
The baby wipes are in the cabinet.
Right.
Heroin's in the diaper pail, baby wipes are in the cabinet.
Where else would they be?
I can't believe this.
You're kidding me?
Thirty-two benningtons in the London area?
Yes, sir.
Uh, I'll get back to you.
I, I... oh, boy.
I know, I know.
Yes, yes, yes.
Sshh.
Oh, God.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, we tried your mommy.
Maybe I should, uh, maybe I should try mine, huh?
Yeah.
Mom!
Well, where is she?
Oh, mom.
Wait 'til you see her.
You won't believe this.
She is so beautiful.
She looks just like you.
You know, you boys live like pigs.
Oh, mom.
Look, there.
Isn't she beautiful?
There she is!
Look at that little baby!
Will you come to me?
I'm gonna pick you right up.
Yes, I'm gonna pick you right up.
Oh, I'm in awe.
I mean, look at you.
You pick her up like a pro.
I pick her up like a grandmother.
That's called experience.
Darling, let's see you.
She's so lovely.
What's her name?
Mary.
Mary!
Well, Mary!
Look at the way she's looking at me.
For a moment, there, I had her laughing.
Yeah, just like me, huh?
Don't ruin this for me, Jack.
Oh, she adores you.
She knows that you're her grandmother.
It's like a biological thing, an instant connection.
Cut the crap, Jack.
What do you want?
Mom, I can't take care of her.
I don't know what to do.
I was hoping that you could take her for a little while, not forever.
You know, until she's ready to vote?
Oh, I would love to.
Do you know, Jack, some people live all their lives...
Without having anything this wonderful to show for it?
I know, mom.
I'm going to do the most wonderful thing for you:
Absolutely nothing.
Why?
Jack, you've always run away from responsibility.
Now you have to turn and face it.
Mom...
I'm a screw-up.
You were a screw-up.
Now you're a father, and you'll be a fine one.
Think so?
I know it.
Your father, God rest his soul, he was a screw-up, and he turned out just fine.
Really?
Don't you remember?
Yeah, I guess.
Now, give me a kiss.
Mary, give me a kiss.
Now, you and your friends...
Clean this place up.
If not for yourselves, do it for my granddaughter.
We will, we will.
Bye.
Thanks anyway, mom.
Well, looks like it's just you and me now, kid.
What?
Oh, Jack?
There's 4 bottles prepared already, so you should be fine until tomorrow morning.
If her bottom gets red, give her a bottle of water.
In about 3 hours...
White as marble.
We'll be in seats d-11 through 14.
If there's a problem, the Usher will get us.
Oh, here's the number.
Wait a minute.
Are you leaving right now?
Yeah, now.
When are you coming back?
Around midnight.
Don't worry about us.
Is this a four?
Yeah.
It's good to have.
So, uh, what do you want to do?
This show's been running longer than Mary's been alive.
Peter, we agreed not to mention her name tonight, right?
Right.
My mistake.
Who did you guys con into sitting for you?
Jack.
Jack?
Daddy?
Wooo... are you hungry?
Well, we're in luck here.
Tonight, the chef has...
Cooked up something very special for you.
He has taken the juice of one cow, and sauteed it with a fine sauce.
It is presented, surrounded by a bottle, and topped off with a delicious rubber nipple, eh?
Excellent choice!
Yes, yes, here we go.
Ah, yes.
What, what?
Here you go.
Come on.
Please?
You don't want it, huh?
I just changed you.
Huh?
And you're not hungry.
What else is there in life?
I always wanted to be a musical comedy star.
- Did you ever try?
- No.
Ladies and gentlemen, act ii will begin in three minutes.
Three minutes.
Michael, have you ever done any acting?
No, no, I leave that to Jack.
The idiot.

J.'S.
Sing us a song from the 2nd act.
Are they always this strange?
Yes...
Since they got involved with another woman.
Wasn't that fun, huh?
Yes.
Ooh, cover that.
Jack, where are you?
Jack!
I'm right here.
What, what?
What are you doing?
What's it look like I'm doing, Peter?
Is everything all right?
Everything's fine, yeah.
Why are you back so soon?
Uh, we thought that we might have left the stove on.
No, no.
The stove's not on.
I think that uncles Peter and Michael...
Are having a nervous breakdown.
I called, Jack.
I let the phone ring for 5 minutes.
Why didn't you answer the phone?
Well, because Mary and I were taking a shower, weren't we?
We didn't hear anything.
Isn't that the truth, mademoiselle?
Oh, you are cute.
I never put a phone in a shower before.
Do you get many calls in here?
A steady stream.
Here.
"Commercial director hospitalized after mugging."
Yeah, take a look at this.
It's your friend, Paul milner.
"Don't let this happen to you.
Be at the phone booth...
At the corner of 81st and Columbus at 8 pm tonight."
They're trying to intimidate us.
I hate that.
I've had enough of this doo-doo!
I want to finish this, okay?
Wa-wa-wa-wa.
Hello?
Yeah, we got your message.
Uh-uh.
No good.
We do it our way.
Because we got the stuff, and if you don't do it our way... come on!
Say it, say it.
We flush it down the toilet!
Okay, now.
Listen, and listen good.
There's a construction site...
Car 20 following suspects, South bound, central park west.
Come on, Peter!
Damn it, Joe, we lost them!
I've got 3 blocks to turn around!
That was great.
That was great.
Everybody remember what they're supposed to do?
Come on, Peter.
It's not that complicated a plan.
Next, he'll want us to synchronize our watches.
Should we do that?
Yes, thank you.
Hello, sergeant melkowitz.
My name is Jack holden.
I think you know my 2 roommates.
I must have been crazy to agree with that guy.
"Orange elevator." Here it is.
"Close door."
Okay. 15, please.
15?
Yeah.
I'm all filthy.
What's wrong, sweetheart?
Come here.
What is it, huh?
Well, you should have told me before we left.
Oh, boy.
This is not a good time to do this.
Hold still.
There you go.
Michael!
They're here.
You know, this is really aggravating.
I'm here, by the pipes.
I don't have a lot of time... hold it, just hold it.
What?
What?
Look, where is the stuff?
Give it to me.
It's in the elevator.
Oh, bullshit!
It's in the control panel.
Check for yourself.
What am I supposed to do, bring my handy tool kit here?
You realize that...
We had absolutely nothing to do with this.
We had no idea what was in the package.
No kidding.
I could've figured that out in 4 seconds.
I mean, you guys don't behave like pros.
Right!
We're not pros.
I just said that, didn't I?
Why make it so complicated?
We've never done this.
I've got it!
Great.
You're forgiven this time.
Very wise of you to cooperate.
Glad it's over.
No happier than I am, believe me.
Dealing with amateurs is a real pain in the ass.
So is dealing with professionals.
No doubt.
Hey, what is that?
What are you, abusing my trust here?
Whoa!
There's someone in there!
Come on!
Come on, Michael!
Oh, no.
Look out!
I lost my balance.
You all right?
Did you get it?
Yeah, I got it!
Who's doing this?
I want that camera, punk!
There's 6 switches!
Aw, these guys wrecked my day!
Jack!
What the hell happened?
He hit the wrong button.
He what?
- Can it go any faster?
- This is it!
You punks!
Jack!
Jack!
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.
I want that home movie.
I'll wait for you...
I want it!
Oh, no.
Jack!
Hit the button on the left!
The one on the left, Jack!
What, what?
Hit the button on the left!
There is no left.
Come on, get it going faster!
I can't!
Please... what's the matter?
Why is this elevator stopped?
I got 'em!
- What's going on?
- It just ain't running'.
- Did you hit the buttons?
- Yeah.
It's dead.
Oh, boy.
Uncles Peter and Michael will be plenty ticked off with daddy.
Aren't you glad he's on our side?
You wait for me!
I know where you live!
Oh, no, Vince.
Why is this happening?
Why is this happening?
Why?
It's okay, guys, it's okay.
Hi.
Are you sergeant melkowitz?
Yeah.
Are you the father?
Yes, yes, I am.
Thanks for the phone call.
It was Peter's idea.
Hi, guys.
She's okay.
Hello, sergeant.
The guys you want are in that elevator.
The drugs are up there, too.
All you need to know is here.
It's very illuminating.
Thanks a lot.
If I have any questions,
I know where to reach you guys.
Can I hold the baby?
No.
No.
Uh, I guess not.

Good morning.
Hello.
There you go.
Yes?
I'm Sylvia...
Mary's mother.
I've come to get her.
Just a minute.
How is she?
She's fine.
She's teething.
That can be rough.
Can I see her?
Sure.
Come on in.
I don't believe how wonderful she looks!
Oh!
Hello, Mary!
Hello, my darling.
It's your mommy.
Yes, it's your mommy.
You're very beautiful.
Your hair is growing.
You've changed so much, and I've missed it.
Mommy has missed you.
Oh, I never thought I'd miss her this much.
Hello!
Hello!
Where's my baby?
Is Jack here?
I'll get him.
Mary, look how big you've gotten!
Ah!
Michael.
Michael.
Sylvia's here.
Mary's leaving.
She looks very happy, Jack.
You've obviously taken good care of her.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have left her the way I did.
I hope it didn't cause too much trouble.
No, no.
No trouble at all.
Sylvia...
There's something I need to know.
Is she really mine?
Yes, she is.
So, what are you going to do now?
Do you have any idea?
I, uh...
I'm going home.
I can't work and take care of Mary on my own, so, uh...
We're going to move in with my family.
They said they'd help.
You're going to London?
Yeah.
When?
Tonight.
Is that what you really want to do?
Sorry?
Never mind.
You pack all the bottles?
Yeah.
And the cans of formula?
You packed 'em.
Yeah.
What about the blender?
Should we give her that, to mash up bananas and stuff?
Sure.
And diapers.
You pack extra pampers?
Yeah.
How can he let her go?
If I were Jack, I would not let her go.
Neither would I, Michael, neither would I.
But he's the father.
I don't think he wants her to go.
But he just can't admit it.
You know, if you want anything at all, you call us.
She'll probably be hungry in an hour.
She's a real good eater, so... like her daddy.
Some of this stuff's fragile.
I got it.
If she wakes up at night, she likes to be sung to.
'50s and '60s music works best.
I'll remember that.
You're all set.
Everything's packed.
If you need anything else, call us.
Anything.
Okay?
Thank you.
Well, here, let me.
Go ahead.
There we go.

I'll write and let you know how we're doing.

Right?
Well, should we?
I suppose not.
She's better off with her mother.
And we are definitely better off...
Now that everything's back to normal.
Right?
Whatever you say, Jack.
Right.
So how come I feel so bad?
What'd you say?
How come I feel so bad?
I have this ache, right here.
I don't know.
What do you think, Mike?
Could be the wine.
It's not the wine.
Well, what is it, then?
I don't know.
I wish it would go away.
Maybe it's something you ate.
Maybe you're not getting enough sleep.
It's not that.
Then what the hell is it?
I miss Mary.
Okay?
I miss Mary.
I just wish there was something I could do.
Well, maybe there is.
What?
When's her flight leaving?
Yo, taxi!
Taxi!
Yeah, Kennedy.
Who are you guys chasing?
My baby girl.
Her mother's taking her to London.
How old?
7 months.
7 months.
That's hard work.
Pretty soon, they start to walk.
The first time you hear the word "daddy,"
your heart just melts.
Can you drive a little faster, please?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Good luck, guys.

Excuse me, sir.
Hold it, fellows.

Thank you, sir, one at a time... 1, 2, 3, 4!
Miss, flight 176?
That's it.
Thank you.
Good night.
Sylvia.
Are you all right?
We thought you'd gone.
I couldn't go, Jack.
I couldn't do it.
I don't want to make another mistake.
I knew if I took her, I'd be making another mistake.
I have to work...
And I can't do that and take care of Mary alone.
Do you know what's it's like?
A one-room flat, on your feet all day, working or auditioning.
I'm on the job sometimes until 3 in the morning.
Since Mary gets up at 5:30, I don't get much sleep.
And after 5:30, it starts over at 9:00.
By the time I change her and play with her, it's 8:00.
Forget about sleep after that.
With baby-sitters, all my money is sucked down the tubes.
And me so tired, I can't take Mary to the park.
Getting time for the park is a bitch!
I mean, I love my job but...
I sometimes feel like I'm just working to pay the sitters...
And I run around all day, and I don't get enough sleep.
I don't think I'm taking very good care of Mary.
- Of course you are.
- I am?
I couldn't cope.
We know how hard it is.
The 3 of us could hardly manage.
I don't want to go to London.
I want to work in New York.
But I can't do that alone.
I hope I don't have to.
I need help.
I need someone to help me.
We'll help.
We will help!
You can leave her anytime you want.
When you go for an audition or shopping, or you want to be by yourself.
I hoped you'd say that.
Really?
Thank you, so much!
Of course!
Hold it, guys.
I don't like this arrangement.
I just don't want to be Mary's baby-sitter.
I want... we want to be able to see her all the time.
I agree, so what are you saying?
What do you mean?
I'm saying...
That I think...
Mary should move in with us permanently, that we should be her family.
It's lovely of you to offer...
But I couldn't let Mary... no, no, no, no... you're right.
She's your daughter.
She needs a full-time mother.
That's why...
We think that you should move in, too.
It's a great idea!
Yeah!
Oh Sylvia, come on.
4 is better than 3.
Uh, do you have room?
I'll build you and Mary rooms.
Yeah, he builds rooms!
Please say yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!

And that is an alternative that is unacceptable, my friend.
Names check out?
Eight names, but no faces.
Doesn't matter.
We're gonna do 'em all.
I swore an oath.
Hey, that must be her by the limo.
The streets'll be moving hard and quick.
With Constantine dead, it's gonna continue to come down hard and quick... until those animals get tired of chewing' on each other.
Sounds like we'll be goin' to lots of funerals.
That'll be great, till the civilians start walkin' out in the cross fire.
Roll up anyone who's makin' the wrong kind of noise.
Here's some more photos.
These are the ones that weren't I.D.'d, so maybe somebody can recognize one of these turkeys.
Didn't we bust this guy a couple years ago?
- Yeah.
Rudy, uh, somethin'.
- Who's this?
No one seems to know her, but she was in the limo behind the hearse.
- Relative?
- Or a girlfriend.
Where's the limo from?
Um, it's rented.
Clevander Limo.
I'm gonna hang onto this one.
Pretty freaky, huh?
I'm comin' at you from the other side, man.
Dead.
You believe it?
Did it happen peaceful in my sleep, or was— or was it like some evil forces?
You know, don't you, Reb?
So take care of it.
Dig?
I mean, some cocaine cowboys done The Wire.
I want you to play Geronimo.
Now I gotta do this other number.
I, Edward Constantine—
How many people even knew my real name, huh?
Being of sound mind and body, do hereby bequeath all my worldly possessions... to my sister, Victoria Elizabeth Constantine.
Reb, you out there, dude?
You gotta take care ofher.
Make sure she gets everything, all right?
I love you, man.
Must be down for the social season.
Look who's here to greet us, Sonny.
A man so happy his eyes are shining.
Maybe it's a permanent condition.
Cheap jokes, cheap cops.
Just get the hell outta here, huh?
I'm clean.
I'm legit.
Next thing you know, I'll be singin'in a choir.
Now, T.J., don't make me play 20 questions.
Otherwise, I'll have to take you in for that drug test like the last time.
Just look on the bright side of things.
Parole violation'll give you plenty of time to get rid of that nasty postnasal drip.
You guys are supposed to have a court order.
My customers value their privacy.
Give me a break.
It was for the guy's sister.
Aw.
Thank you very much.
Now, see, that wasn't so painful, was it?
What are you lookin' at, Julio?
Wash the limo.
- It's okay.
I'm a friend of your brother's.
I'll see you downstairs.
The Wire was my best friend.
He was a great man.
My brother was a criminal.
Maybe he told you about me.
Reb?
Look, I have no interest in ever knowing any of my brother's friends.
- You come from a world I wish never existed.
- Well, you don't understand.
I never will.
I have to give you your inheritance.
I don't want my inheritance.
I don't want anything from his world.
I took an oath.
My loyalty is honor.
You're just as crazy as he was.
I just wish you'd get the hell out of here.
Please!
Please.
Yeah.
Who is it?
Flowers for Mr. Salazar.
- What is this, a joke?
- Yeah.
On you.
That tickles.
You guys brain damaged?
You're in big trouble.
- Where are the Krugerrands?
- You can't buy Krugerrands anymore.
I'm gonna ask you nice once more.
Where are they?
Wet bar, living room.
You got what you want.
Now get out.
It's not that easy, maricón.
What else can I do?
The truth'll set you free.
Truth about what?
The Wire.
It's started, Lieutenant.
What have we got?
Nothing but an ugly way to die.
What about The Wire's sister?
Maybe she's movin' in.
Talk to her.
No, pleasel
Nol No, nol
Nol
Nol
Hey, Reb, where'd you learn about this guy Nietzsche?
Prison?
The will to power, eternal reoccurrence.
The man understood it all.
How much does he know about killin'?
You'll understand in the next life.
You see, it's all part of my mission.
My mission's almost done.
What is this?
First three gorillas, and now you two.
Were these guys friends of your brother's?
Did they happen to mention their names?
Have you ever seen them before?
No.
Look, I had nothing to do with my brother's business.
He was good to me.
I only knew that side.
The rest took place in another universe.
Listen, your brother controlled over a third of the market.
His departure created quite a void.
Like I said, Officer, they live in another universe.
I couldn't remember even if I wanted to.
If you change your mind.
Thank you.
"Kiss me and kiss me again. "
You know what E.E. Cummings said about that.
"Kisses are a better fate than wisdom. "
How many people here are from out of town?
Where are you from, ma'am?
Boca Raton.
No, I mean, where were you born?
Los Angeles, huh?
How about those Lakers, huh?
Buck for M.V.P., huh?
Well, you know what they say.
Hey, nice chopper, man.
Hey, Reb.
Hey, glad to hear you're out on parole, man.
I'm sorry to hear about The Wire.
Hey, listen, anything you want, man.
You want my car?
It's chopped and channeled.
There you go.
It's parked right out in front out there.
Anything you want.
You want a woman?
Huh?
Be good karma for you.
Shut up.
Come here.
Names.
It's Valleriano.
It's Correnti.
Bernier.
No, I don't know their names.
Speak.
That's, uh, Cooper and Burnett.
They're local pond scum, you know?
Real lightweights.
I didn't ask for your opinion.
You're still a worm, Izzy.
Thank you.
It's the path of least resistance, huh?
Hey, thanks for comin' on by, huh?
Uh, any requests?
Doorman's not even sure it was Pena's apartment.
Just a bunch of screams.
We went up and knocked, but there was no answer.
Figured he was one of your guys so we gave you a call.
Did you check inside?
It was quiet.
We've got no probable cause.
Pena is probable cause.
Never in my life I heard screams like this.
What floor's Pena on?
1201.
We'll take 11.
Psst.
We can rule out suicide.
Valleriano, Sutton, Mueller,
Salazar and Pena.
All— No más.
There's gotta be a connection here.
Yeah, there is.
They were all very bad boys.
Constantine's sister mentioned his business associates.
Have we got anything on The Wire's social habits?
Wait a minute.
Didn't he use the Violators for security?
Biker gang?
Yeah.
He's got Einstein runnin' point for him.
Oh, yeah.
Cragun.
Jack Cragun.
Who is that?
Oh, this guy is a beauty.
You'll really like him.
I wanna introduce you to him.
He's bright, articulate, funny—
Intelligent, sweet, caring.
You know, I knew you were in here.
I could smell you all the way outside.
Think it'd be better if I bit your nose off?
Oh, God, I love it when you talk that way.
It makes me so hot.
Shove it.
Ah-ah-ah-ah!
Ah-ah.
Now we're gonna play "name the wacko".
Come on.
I could do this all day, every day.
Who is it?
Give me a name.
Your mama.
Give me the name of the guy who's whacking' the dealers.
Lists.
Eight guys.
Wire's customers the last two weeks.
Reb's gonna kill 'em all.
Thank you.
Big guy.
It's good to be amongst friends.
*For he's a jolly good fellow?
*For he's a jolly good fellow?
Park's closed, folks.
Who the hell do you think you are?
Park rangers.
So you better quit flappin' your jaws and grab some pavement, mama.
Do something!
Don't just sit there, you wimp!
Yeah, do somethin', you wimp.
Hey, no food in the park.
Yeah!
You wimp!
*For he's a jolly good fellow?
Thanks.
The guests say they never heard a shot.
Must've taken Bernier by surprise too.
Hey, that Gustafson would've made a hell of a sniper.
He's a killer.
Your buddy Cragun?
Well, he was right.
Every victim did business with Constantine two weeks before he died.
I wanna catch this psycho.
Call Raiford.
Find out who did his psych workup.
See if he's at all predictable.
Oh, he's predictable.
He never misses.
Why don't we just split up and cover the remaining three?
Yeah?
Who gets yours truly?
A pattern?
Did Genghis Khan have a pattern?
Yeah.
Rape, pillage and burn.
Well, there you have it— a classic psychopath.
Incapable of emotion or regard for human life.
A finely tuned machine, eager to destroy everybody and everything in his path.
You make him sound like a robot.
A robot?
My mistake.
The man is crazy.
He's the devil incarnate.
He makes Manson look like Mr. Rogers.
He seemed to have formed an extraordinary bond... with Edward Constantine.
You know, like Hitler and Himmler.
You mean the late Edward Constantine.
And now he feels he must avenge his friend's death.
Yeah.
By snuffing' everyone on the list until he gets the right one.
Well, in his mind it makes perfect sense.
Process of elimination, in the truest sense of the term.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Hey, Reb, man.
Hope you come to party, man.
Hey, Reb, don't be shy, man.
These ladies have plenty to go around.
I don't swim in dirty water.
What's that supposed to mean?
Have the trash out at 11:00.
We're ridin' tonight.
Hey, man, we're hav— Don't touch me.
Don't talk anymore, and just do as I say.
Understand?
If Reb takes out any more of these guys, you and I are gonna be out of business, partner.
Yeah, and if he completes his list, you're gonna be ridin' solo, pal of mine.
Then maybe I could get, uh, partnered off with a real looker.
You know, long legs, silk stockings and everything.
- Hey, you got something against my legs?
Hi, kids.
Sorry to break up the party.
Victoria just pulled in, and she's alone.
No sign of any degenerate, overactive thyroid case.
Bye.
All right.
Chances are he'll show up here or at Zeferelli's, Rico.
Hold it right there!
This is yours.
Rico?
Your partner carry a rabbit's foot or something?
Is that supposed to be funny?
Just wondering, 'cause he's gotta be the luckiest patient in this hospital.
Another 16th of an inch and you would've been in your dress blues.
He's gonna be okay, right?
Yeah, well, he's fine now, basically.
Just got a bad concussion.
Oh, um, yeah.
If he seems a little disoriented, don't worry about it.
It's just the drugs.
I can't kill him.
Take it easy, Rico.
Like a machine.
Two slugs in him, and he didn't even flinch.
Come on.
Easy.
Hang in there, pal.
I know what you're feelin'.
I want you off the streets.
You're too easy of a target.
Listen, you yank me in now, and we stand to lose Gustafson.
And if he goes underground, I'll be hit the moment he comes up for air.
I want him out in the open where I can deal with him.
Switek's on Gustafson.
I want you staking' the girl.
Yeah, well, tell Switek not to try to take him alone.
He wants me, and we got a better shot at taking him if we let him come and get me.
I'm tryin' to prevent that.
No.
I told you I don't want it.
It's bad money.
Then make somethin' good out of it.
You're in trouble, aren't you?
What trouble?
Next time.
Trudy.
Yeah, it's Switek.
I'm on the end of River Road on Virginia Key.
Yeah.
Look, Gustafson went in there alone, but I'm guessin' the altar boys are in there too.
Got it.
I'll have a team there in two minutes.
Say, Reb.
What?
How many more of these dudes we gonna ace?
Two more.
Then what?
We're outta this pit.
Where we goin'?
Valhalla.
Valhalla?
That's nice.
Always wanted to go to Europe.
Wire's sister goin' with us?
She doesn't hang around with trash like you, Toad.
Yeah?
Just give me an address.
Sonny, Castillo does not want you there.
Damn it, Gina.
What am I supposed to do, wait for a report on this maniac?
Sonny—
Just give me a cross street.
Anything.
All right.
End of River Road and Virginia Key.
Attention, occupants.
This is the Metro Police.
You are to immediately vacate the premises with your hands in plain view.
Exit the house slowly.
Hands above your head.
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
We surrender!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
We surrender!
We surrender!
Don't shoot!
I said, exit the house now!
Hey, Lascoe, you microwaved that sucker!
Two more for The Wire!
Yah!
Aah!
The bastard!
Burnett, look out!
You awake?
Yeah.
Been awake.
You know, it's funny how dawn makes everything look clean.
Yeah, but they're out there.
Who?
The monsters, the freaks, the animals.
You think you know the street, and then every once in a while, you find a whole new level.
What about the sister?
Gone.
Vanished.
I don't know, I don't know.
Maybe she's innocent.
Be nice to think that there's some cosmic balance in the universe.
But there sure isn't any innocence.
We've gotta be better.
Better?
What's with this "better" crap?
You really think we're better?
Better shots.
(theme from the twilight zoneplays)
(heartbeat)
the devil, they say, having so far failed to destroy the human race with nuclear weapons, toxic waste, or elevator music, has finally devised his most cunning weapon-- long-term credit with fine print written... in the twilight zone.
evan, you help me with b.j.'s stroller, okay?
fine.
matthew, don't go too far!
here you go, little fellow.
how you doing?
(baby crying) yeah, yeah... yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, come on.
come on, there we go, there we go.
here it is.
here, this is it.
get the door.
sit down, sit down over there.
hello. my name is linda wolfe.
i have an appointment with catherine foley.
one moment.
ms. foley, linda wolfe is here.
put that down.
yes, i'll tell her.
boy:
ow!
boy:
get away from me. no!
receptionist:
ms. foley, i did take care of all that and we sent them over.
they'll be delivered in about a week.
boy:
like this, do it like this.
yes, ma'am.
right away.
ms. foley will see you now.
oh, thank you.
(boys chatting) you boys wait here and behave yourselves.
thank you.
mrs. wolfe, thank you for taking the time to come in and see us.
please sit down.
well, it's not every day i get a phone call inviting me to be a credit card holder.
it's not every day we make the offer.
would you like some coffee?
oh, no, i'm fine, thank you.
mrs. wolfe, you have a very spotty credit record.
i know.
amex, visa, mastercard have all canceled you in the past.
so have the department stores.
even union 76.
yes, well, that's the past.
i've really...
i-i really think i've learned my lesson.
well, good.
maybe we can do some business.
what do you know about our card?
nothing. uh, until your call, i'd never heard of you.
well, let's say that we understand that modern life cannot be conducted on a cash basis.
so we offer credit to those who can't get it anywhere elsewhere.
you're the credit card of last resort.
(laughter) exactly.
but because of that, we have some very stringent and unusual requirements.
for example, we insist on a minimum payment within seven days of purchase as opposed to the usual 30 days.
that's kind of rough, isn't it?
most of our card holders don't seem to mind.
it's a small percentage, sort of a good faith gesture.
but there are severe penalties and service charges.
they're all spelled out right here in the cardholder's agreement.
what do you say?
where do i sign?
right there.
here's your card.
thank you.
(laughs) thank you very much.
you're welcome.
evan, take boris outside.
you know he makes daddy sneeze.
daddy isn't here.
yes, he is.
come on, evan honey.
take boris outside, outside please.
hey. come on.
(cat meows) hey, babe.
hi.
don't tell me i forget our anniversary.
very funny.
i just bought myself a little present, okay?
well, you deserve a present.
what credit card is this?
matt, since your brother had to take the cat out you got to take the garbage out.
that's my new credit card.
oh, really?
(sighs) are we gonna start fighting about linda's problem again?
no. no.
i don't think that'd be a good idea at all.
good.
please... honey, be careful.
oh, brian, come on.
what are you burning for dinner?
oh, no!
man (on television):
...let's go!
woman (on television):
okay, $400. lower.
man:
$400... (indistinct chatter, voices on tv) boris?
boris?
boy:
don't!
don't!
evan!
evan, the back door was open.
is the cat in the house?
what cat?
our cat, boris. remember?
short, furry, four legs.
okay, kids, come on, time for bed, huh?
time for bed, let's go.
let's go. come on.
linda:
boris!
hubba-hub-bub.
boris!
boris?
linda. linda.
boris.
linda, linda.
what is all this about a cat?
what do you mean, what is all this about a cat?
linda, i cannot get them a cat.
i'm allergic to cats.
well, i know. that's why we keep him on the porch.
you got a cat?
for god's sakes, brian, have you lost your mind?
all right, if we don't have a cat then tell me what's been eating out of this cat dish and sleeping on this ratty old cushion?
(sighs) oh, i get it.
this is someone's idea of a joke?
very funny, brian.
really, very funny.
boris?
boris?
i think you've made an excellent choice with the new refrigerator/freezer.
real top of the line, lots of volume.
will this be cash or charge?
oh, uh, charge, please.
thank you.
you know, if you really want to get the kids a cat there's a pet store on the way home.
a short-haired cat.
i don't want to talk about this anymore.
two days ago, we had a cat.
and now you and the boys are convinced we never did.
well, i didn't think it was funny to begin with and i don't think it's getting any funnier.
mrs. wolfe... mr. wolfe, there seems to be a problem with your credit card.
could you come with me, please?
certainly.
man #2:
yeah, if we could just do that over nine months... i didn't want to discuss this out there but the credit card company refuses to approve the purchase.
why?
why don't you talk to them?
(sighs) hello?
yes, this is mrs. wolfe.
this is a very nice model.
woman:
oh, it is.
oh, yeah.
i'm so sorry.
oh, it's not your fault.
they're very strange.
yeah, they are.
oh, mr. wolfe, the refrigerator should be at your house within seven days.
thank you.
thank you.
thank you very much.
what was that all about?
oh, i forgot to make the first payment on the card.
i guess the slip got thrown out with the box or something.
i don't know.
linda, you told you had that card only a week.
that's right.
that's the way they operate.
anyway, i wrote a check out for it right here.
i don't have any more money, but the credit card people are happy.
if they're happy, i'm happy.
i don't, uh... i don't suppose you'd like to make me a loan, get me through the week?
i don't think that'd be a good idea.
fine.
(baby cooing) there we go. bedtime.
i would like to help.
(baby cooing) oh, there.
night, night, sweetie.
(baby cooing)
hey, what's going on in here?
you guys aren't supposed to up.
it's past your bedtime.
come on.
time for bed.
come on, matt.
let's go, let's go, come on.
come on. all right, all right.
hey, scooby, off the bed.
(dog whimpers) hop in.
that a boy.
under the covers.
let's go, come on.
come on, help me out here.
there we go.
all right, good night, you guys.
good night.
now, mommy and daddy don't want to hear another word out of you.
all right?
good night, guys.
lights out.
i love you.
night, daddy.
good night.
(phone ringing) it's the linda wolfe account.
i know you made an acquisition.
she's late again.
exercise your option.
(chuckles)
(beep)
(beeping)
(humming)
hmm.
evan!
mom!
what, mom?
you think the dog might like some hamburger in his friskies?
where is the dog, anyway?
you guys got him out on the porch?
what's the matter?
cat's got your tongue?
where's the dog?
what dog?
evan wolfe, stop playing games!
mom, i'm not playing games!
well, somebody's playing games.
first boris disappears, and now scooby. matt?
"scooby"?
who took the dog food?
(sighs)
scooby!
scooby!
(sighs) scooby!
(sighs)
well, the boys are finally in bed, and b.j.'s sound asleep.
good.
linda, we have to talk.
i suppose the boys told you that their mother is cracking up.
imagining that we have a cat and dog when obviously we don't.
when i came home, i found them hiding in their room.
they didn't say anything.
look, you're cooped up here all day long by yourself with two pre-school delinquents and a teething baby.
it'd be unusual if you didn't get a little upset.
oddly enough, i'm not cheered up by that.
would you like to talk to someone else?
a professional?
a psychiatrist.
would you like to?
brian, i'm not cracking up.
i admit there's something weird going on here but let's not make a federal case out of it.
okay?
okay.
is this the credit card bill for the refrigerator?
i thought you had to make a payment within a week.
so?
so, we bought the refrigerator eight days ago.
three of those days were weekends, honey.
they can't count that.
okay, i'll mail it out tomorrow.
and i have no plans to use that card anymore.
thank you.
that would be nice.
(sighs)
(strange engine noise)
(engine thunking)
(engine stalling)
(steam hissing)
(distant horn honks)
(sighs)
(horn honking)
(sighs) tow driver:
lady, at the very least you're looking at a new water pump.
parts and labor's gonna run you $300.
$300?
!
plus, uh, 60 bucks for my tow.
well, i... i've only got, uh... twelve dollars.
unhook it, bill!
wait!
wait!
wait!
i, uh... i have a credit card, okay?
well, why didn't you say so?
jack it back up, bill.
let's get it out of here.
jerk.
(beeping, computer keys clicking)
yes?
she used it even though she was delinquent?
no. no, no.
we have no choice.
do it now.
brian?
boys?
anybody home?
brian?
hi. what happened to you?
oh, the car broke down, i had to get it towed.
and then, they couldn't find the right water pump so i had to wait forever.
well, babe, why didn't you call?
so you could drag b.j. and the boys out to a gas station?
i had enough to deal with.
who's b.j.?
including this moron driving the tow...
"who's b.j.?"
(sighs) brian, "who's b.j.?"
oh, no!
oh, my...!
my baby!
evan!
matthew!
oh!
brian... something's happened to the boys' rooms.
i don't know what you're talking about, honey.
the baby... brian, stop it, stop it, stop it!
stop it!
i need...
i want my children!
stop it!
wait a minute. stop!
we don't have any children.
we never had any children.
we don't have a cat.
we don't have a dog.
look, linda, honey, i can't do this all by myself.
i can't. i have to call somebody.
no, no, no, no, no, no, baby, please!
no, no, no!
don't call anybody, please!
i'll do it. i'll call somebody in the morning.
i promise i'll call a doctor. please.
(panting) i'll be all right.
i just... i just... need to calm down.
(sighs) i just need to relax.
(panting) i'll be all right.
i'll be all right.
okay.
please, just leave me alone.
just go to bed. i'll be in in a while.
please!
just...
(sobbing) (muttering)
(sighs)
?
?
evan!
matthew!
?
?
(sighs)
(crying)
i want my babies.
?
?
i want to see that foley person.
i want to see her now!
just one moment, please.
ms. foley, linda wolfe is in here demanding to see you.
my kids!
those are my kids!
matthew!
oh!
evan!
my baby!
evan!
matthew!
secretary:
bill, bill, take care of this, please.
my baby!
you better let me in or i'll tear this place apart!
come in here with me, mrs. wolfe.
yes, those were your children.
earlier this week we acquired your cat and your dog.
what seems to be the problem?
you've just taken my children away from me, and no one even remembers that i had them!
look... we acquire the experiential matrix along with the principal.
it wouldn't be fair to give someone a cat or a person... what are you saying?
...without the accompanying memories, would it?
what kind of people are you?
well, you said it yourself.
we're "the credit card of last resort."
now, you signed a business agreement with us.
and you failed to make the good faith payments.
and we collected.
it's all in the cardholder agreement.
i don't give a damn about your cardholder agreement!
assuming for the moment that i even understood what you people are capable of doing, that doesn't make it right.
you can't just take someone's children away!
we can take anything we like, mrs. wolfe.
as long as you fail to make the minimum payment.
oh!
now, if it's any consolation to you, we make every effort to place the principal in a better environment.
oh, no!
our disbursement division is very good at that.
no, ma'am, my children don't need a better environment.
they need me, i'm their mother.
really?
you've already proven that you're a compulsive spender.
you demonstrated to me considerable irresponsibility, signing a contract that you didn't bother to read or understand?
okay, all right... i'll go to your disbursement division.
i'll buy my children back.
with what?
your bank indicates that your personal account is overdrawn.
this is on our joint checking account.
is that enough?
okay, when can i have my children back?
you do understand that this check must clear, of course.
if it doesn't, there will be another penalty assessment.
that's no problem.
i'll be back.
i'll be back, and my children better be here.
brian!
brian!
oh, brian!
thank god you're home.
i had to do something today, honey.
where the hell have you been?
i wrote a check on the joint account.
i know. the bank called me.
what-what do you mean?
linda, why don't you talk to me?
!
what did you do at the bank?
what's wrong with me?
!
what did you do?
what did you do at the bank?
i canceled the check.
no!
no!
(gasps)
hello. yes, i need the number of the... (gasps)
brian!
oh, my!
brian!
?
?
?
?
(theme from the twilight zoneplays)
you still here?
i'll come back and get my things after my shift.
yeah, well, you just might find 'em in the front yard.
want breakfast?
well, i was going to go up and eat at the cafe.
no, you don't.
now, you can go and tell les and bobby and charlie that i threw you out, but i ain't going to have you going to work eating cafe breakfasts. here.
thank you.
i appreciate it.
hmm.
melissa, melissa, look, this whole thing just one big mistake, baby.
i swear that girl don't mean nothing to me.
she meant enough for you to go and sleep with her.
how many times i got to say it?
i am ashamed of what i did!
you ashamed of what you did, or you ashamed 'cause you got caught?
well, what'd you want me to do, huh?
i mean, you want me to beg you for forgiveness for the rest of my life?
how the hell you want your eggs?
ba... charlie:
they told me i could have the night shift if i wanted to.
that way i'd never have to see another sunrise again.
bobby:
yeah, unless it's because you late.
les:
like you were this morning.
i'm not kidding, though, 'cause my boy jeffrey-- he's going to be all-conference football and basketball this year, and i'm not going to miss one of his games.
yeah, you betcha.
bobby:
?
oh, my darling... ?
charlie:
oh, come on, don't start singing this early in the morning.
?
oh, my darling clementine... ?
wilson, parker, you two guys hang on a second.
i'm taking you guys out of shaft 15 this morning.
that's great, schmidt.
hey, we get to work on our golf.
we need a crew in the junction.
junction?
what the hell for?
that's the oldest part of the mine, schmidt.
it was robbed before we was even born.
it's a good thing you guys aren't running this company.
we had a geophysical team from the university down here last month, and they say there's several million dollars' worth of coal in those trenches.
gasification.
yeah, coal gasification.
got a pilot plant over in charleston starting up to do just that.
get to it, boys.
(bell rings) and then they squish it all together, you see, and they make gas.
now, you make yourself enough gas, you see, and the next time they raise them oil prices, you can just tell those fellas to go kiss your sweet patootie.
now, we're not going to listen to this all morning, are we?
yeah, gasification ain't important.
it's high school football.
john:
what you say you read-- i don't know about this.
charlie:
best that article tell you, this part of the mine's about 100 years old.
well, maybe it did, and maybe it didn't.
les:
charlie, maybe it's not too late to change shifts.
(laughter) charlie:
13-c.
(knocking) 13-d-- that- that ain't right.
now what's the matter, charlie?
something wrong?
well, that last turn should've put us at pillar 11.
this says 13.
well, maybe somebody changed the numbers when they closed the junction.
no, more likely we took a serious wrong turn back there.
uh, les, bobby, you track back to the shaft and get old schmidt on the phone.
okay.
all right, and hey, charlie, if we're not back by noon, you start without us.
get out of here.
see you around.
we could be digging down here for the rest of our lives.
why worry?
you're not going anywhere, john.
you could make this a home away from home.
way i hear, you're going to need one anyway.
charlie, you ought to take a look at this.
(grunts) hey, charlie, i think you ought to take a look at this...
john, look out!
(gasping)
(coughing)
charlie?
charlie?
charlie?
!
charlie!
charlie!
charlie!
(coughs):
help!
help.
charlie?
charlie?
charlie!
help!
somebody there?
who's there?
somebody there?
here.
i think i could use a hand.
who's there?
(gasp of pain) just hold it.
(gasps) boy... (grunts) come on. just close your eyes.
get up. come on.
(grunting) thanks.
no problem.
i think i broke my leg.
yeah?
let me take a look.
don't touch me.
hey, come on, let me take a look at it.
(groans) yeah, now, look, i think it is broken.
i'm going to make you a splint.
you ready?
what's that?
what?
on your wrist?
that's a wristwatch.
(beeps) come on, man, i need that.
now, you ready?
yeah.
all right, hold on.
just hold it.
(panting) when you're done, you turn out that fire.
huh?
turn out the lamp.
it'll start an explosion.
this ain't going to cause no explosion.
i'm just hoping that the batteries'll hold out.
now, you hold this for me.
yeah.
right there.
no heat.
hey, come on, man.
right there.
what are you doing?
that's our light!
i've never seen a lantern like this before.
yeah, well, you can pick one up at any hardware store.
cost you about 150 bucks.
$150?
that's three months' pay.
did you say 150 bucks is three months' pay?
uh-huh.
hey, they're still up there.
they got to be looking for us.
yeah. hey, hey!
somebody help!
we're down here!
we're here!
hey, you think they're still looking for us?
they always do.
yeah, well, it sound like you been through a few of these.
i seen it happen.
i spent a lot of time digging my friends out of spots like this.
i can't understand it.
i don't know what happened.
well, i don't rightly know.
one minute, i was swinging a pick, and the next, i was buried under there...
a pick?
you had a pick?
where is it?
!
somewhere up there.
(grunts):
oh, god.
how could you lose a thing like that?
!
we could dig our way out of here!
save your breath!
it's under a ton of rock.
i don't believe i know you.
i didn't know we had colored working in the mine.
yeah, well, we're all over the place, buddy.
and i don't think i know you, either.
i ain't never seen you, not on the day shift.
you work the day shift, and you don't know ray dobson?
no, i don't!
i'm the senior man here.
are you, ray?
!
and making what you make?
!
well, you ought to talk to your union rep, man.
the only union men in this mine are dead men, sir.
now, ray, this is stupid.
we got a hell of a lot more to worry about, instead of you and me down here fighting.
you're right.
yeah, right.
i'm sure your daddy told you the same thing that mine told me.
just like religion and politics, you don't ask a man what he makes.
i wouldn't know.
my pappy died when i was born.
cholera got him in 1877.
yeah, well, i'm s... did you say 1877?
i did.
yeah, well, ray, that makes you about 109 years old, buddy.
on my last birthday, i was 35.
now, come on, ray!
i wasn't that good in math, but i do know that if you was born in 1877, and you just turned 35, well, that just brings you out to 1912.
that's right. september 16, 1912.
there you are, dotty.
did we ever get that letter from the school board?
why are you looking at me like that?
reverend bailey, it is not my place to tell you exactly how to do your job.
oh, come on, dotty, why should you be any different?
i thought you were going to deliver this letter to melissa parker yesterday.
well, i was going to do just that, dotty, when mrs. ritter's husband called about her stroke.
i had to spend the rest of the day at the hospital with the poor woman.
oh, i understand.
i-i'm just... dotty, this thing's been sitting here how long?
60-some years?
since 1912.
and for all we know, it's just some kind of prank.
i mean, no one's ever steamed it open to see what was inside it.
i don't believe anyone's ever bothered to tell melissa parker it exists.
so it's... so it's a day late.
reverend... reverend!
reverend bailey, this letter was entrusted to the church because the instructions were to be followed.
and besides, until their wedding several years ago, there was no melissa parker.
(sighs):
i'm duly chastened, mrs. clark.
of course instructions should be followed.
although i must confess, i see no reason to worry that it was delivered a day late.
(horn sounding) oh.
(horn sounding loudly)
woman:
there must've been an accident at the mine.
yeah, that might work.
what the devil?
come on. you're the one that was worried about flames.
now, you just leave that alone.
what's this?
the last time i checked, it was a five-dollar bill.
oh, yeah?
what do you call this?
counterfeit.
this is a perfectly good silver certificate.
are we going to sit here and talk about this, or are we going to try and dig our way out of here?
you can dig till doomsday, if you want, but you still won't get five feet from where you're standing.
besides, you're using air.
why don't you sit down and rest?
save your strength.
somebody is coming.
trust in the lord.
the lord helps those who help themselves.
i don't like this.
maybe i ought to be dead.
maybe i'm already dead.
then what does that make me?
you're another ghost.
yeah.
there's been a lot of cave-ins down here.
maybe you died in 1912.
well, maybe you're the devil himself.
(alarm blaring) d-13!
we want it in d-13.
oxygen in d-13.
the whole tunnel collapsed.
we're trying to get the men out.
keep them out of there so we can get the work done.
we'll let 'em know them who's safe as soon as we can.
now, move out, boys.
bobby, bobby!
who's with you?
just les.
what about charlie and the parker kid?
they were way back in the junction when the whole thing came down.
damn it!
watch out!
stretcher coming through.
hey, did you see johnny down there?
did you find parker, too?
man:
we were lucky to find this one.
the whole thing is down!
great. gotta search for one man whose air's running out in a hundred square yards of tunnels.
we may never find him in that.
what are you going to do, give up?
no. we've got a few tricks.
hirsch... get the rescue team over to the junction.
bobby will show you the way.
les, pull that crew out of shaft six.
get 'em over to the junction from the other side.
have 'em get some picks and shovels.
that's the only way.
let's move, people.
ray, this air is getting stale.
tastes like coal.
(coughing) got to take it easy.
stretch out the supply.
can we talk at least?
if you can't talk, you might as well die.
anyway, i was seeing abby carter at the time.
she had this sister, sarah, her twin.
they was always pulling the switch on me.
just so happened, they pulled it the very night i was going to propose to abby.
i guess i was so nervous i couldn't tell the difference.
i went right ahead and proposed to sarah.
she said yes.
abby was so mad at me, she wouldn't talk to me for weeks.
which one is that?
is that abby or sarah?
it's sarah, of course.
she's the one that said yes.
she looks like a good woman to me.
yeah.
married, john?
yeah. been married several years.
her name is melissa.
she was my high school sweetheart.
sarah and i have been married five years.
five happy years, i hope.
we had our ups and downs.
well, right now i'm having one of my downs.
i've been making mistakes-- mistakes i'll be paying for the rest of my life.
my mama used to say every night when the sun went down it was the death of the sky.
but at dawn, it's reborn.
she's beautiful.
thank you.
there is color in this picture.
mrs. parker?
melissa parker?
i'm not ready to see you yet, reverend.
this has nothing to do with the mine.
i been looking for you.
it's about a letter addressed to you.
i don't understand.
it's old.
74 years old, to be exact.
what is this?
no one knows.
but you're melissa parker, as it says.
i was supposed to deliver this letter to you yesterday, so you could open it.
go ahead.
"dear mrs. parker,
"this will strike you as madness,
"but there's no other way to put it.
"if you are reading this on september 15, 1986,
"then you must stop your husband john
"from going to the cassutt mine.
"on september 16, he will be trapped in a cave-in."
i don't want excuses.
i want equipment and i want it here right now!
melissa's on her way in here and she's got the reverend with her.
that guy works fast.
what about the vent shaft?
can't we check those?
junction's an old dig, bobby.
they didn't drop as many vent shafts as we do now.
we're just gonna have to face facts.
our chances of finding parker are nonexistent.
i'm sorry, melissa.
please, listen to this.
"john parker is trapped in a junction
"in a tunnel opened september 2, 1912, approximately 25 yards north of pillar 11."
let me see that.
where did this thing come from?
it's been in a safe at my church for some 70 years.
reverend watts showed it to me when i took over.
good god, reverend, i can't pull my crews out of shaft 12 right now.
you don't just pick up and move a crew like that on some goofball idea.
parker is dying down there.
do it.
do what the letter says.
melissa... you're the one who sent him down there.
(digging sounds) ray. ray.
ray, do you hear that?
what is it?
that sound.
listen.
there's somebody up there.
we're here!
we're here!
we're here.
come on. keep coming.
we're alive.
we're here.
man:
we've got him.
i'm down here!
you've got to go back down there.
i'm telling you you've got to go down.
he's still in there.
will you listen to me?
i'm telling you, he's still down there!
what's he talking about?
he's the only one missing.
too much dust, i suppose.
makes him see things.
oh, ray, you're safe.
thank god. oh, god.
sarah... sarah, this man saved me.
his name is john parker.
he didn't know me.
he didn't have to help me.
but he's still down there.
no, ray, it's all right.
you're safe now.
we can go home.
i can't just leave him down there.
ray, they say that you were the only one down there.
no. here's a picture of his wife.
he told me all about her.
the picture is painted.
i know this sounds crazy, honey.
but this man's from the future.
and somewhere...
somehow... she's worrying about him just like you worried about me.
i've got to help him, honey, even though it may mean interfering with the lord's plan.
ray... no.
will you get me a pencil and a piece of paper?
i don't understand any of this, but i love you and i will help you.
"your husband saved my life, mrs. parker.
"and if you believe that a man facing death
"thinks only of those things that are important and true,
"you should know that john was thinking of you.
"he's too good a man
"to spend his life begging forgiveness.
sincerely, ray dobbs."
(shouting and whistling) this guy will do anything to get out of work for a day.
you done real good.
it's okay, melissa.
i'm all right.
melissa... i'm sorry.
i'm so... uh-uh.
let's go home.

- Durex is t'proper name for 'em.
- (Sue) Oh, I didn't know.
I've never had any use for 'em meself.
Can you put one on?
I wouldn't know what to do with one.
Would either of you like to try?
- Not me.
- Or me.
You can just tell us.
I thought you might like to try for yourselves.
No, I don't think we should.
OK.
- First you need an erection.

- An erection.
- What's that?
I don't know.

OK, first you need an 'ard-on, and then you take the rubber johnny as you call it out the packet.
You didn't think we thought you could put packet on, did ya?
So, what happens if it tears?
Not good, then.
The sperm can get out and fertilise the egg.
We haven't got eggs inside us.
We're not ducks, you know.
- Can this come off inside you?
- No.
What do mean exactly when you say "the sperm"?
It's what a man ejaculates.
Shoots his muck, you'd say.
Nobody ever tell you that?
- No.
- All we did at school were drawings of the male and female sex organs.
Didn't your mam or dad tell you owt?
Talk like that's dirty in our house.
If say owt like that, I get a belt.
My mam never wants to talk about it neither.
(Sue) Anyway, what have we stopped here for?
And what we talking about rubber johnnies for?
You were supposed to take us for a ride.
We stopped cos I just wanted to talk to you.
- Find out more about you.
- What for?
Well, things haven't been going too well with me and the wife.
Tell us another one.
It's got reclining seats, this car.
What you want us to do about it?
What do you think, then?
I'll let you know.
Try laying on it if you want.
Might as well.
What do you think you're doing?
- Don't you like it?
- Yeah.
- Why don't you do it to her?
- I will...
After I finish with you.
- Are you sure you can manage two?
- You bet your boots I can.
Get your knickers off.
- Do I have to?
- I can't do nothing with them on.
- Can't I put 'em halfway down?
- You won't be able to move.
I'll tell you what, I'll take 'em off on one leg.
I'll just watch if it's all right.
Right.
Lay down.
Jesus, it looks like a frozen sausage.
- Shift your bum up a bit.
- You what?
- I'm talking to Sue.
- I'm sorry.
That's not much better, but it'll do.
- How long will you be?
- As long as it takes.
OK.
OK!
- Can you shift your leg, Sue?
- What you doing?
I'm trying to get it in, if you'd shut your mouth for a minute.
(Rita tuts) Can I turn the cassette on?
For fuck's sake!
What do you want that on for?
I want to listen to it.
- (Music starts)
- Rita!
(Music stops)
- What?
- Shut up, or you'll stand outside.
I'm sorry, but I'm bored.
You won't be when I've finished here.
Well, go on then, get on with it!
(Sue breathes heavily)
(Sue moans)
(Moaning intensifies)
(Car horn)
- Go on!
- (Moaning)
(Moaning increases)
Yeah!
(Gasps)
(Bob breathes rapidly, then grunts)
(They chuckle)
Ohh.
Did you enjoy that, Sue?
Yeah.
(Cows bellow)
Right, come on then, moaning Minnie!
(Rita) I'm coming!
Hey, you haven't got much room to do it in here, have you?
- It's all me and Sue had.
- I'm not complaining, just saying.
- Will you get your head off me leg!
- I'm sorry!
Come on now, Rita, if you don't want to do it, just say.
I do want to do it.
Hey, Reet, I should move your leg over, it'll hurt you like mad.
Go on, Bob, get stuck in there!
(Moaning)
- (bob) Go on!
- (Rita groans)
(Cows bellow, Rita and Bob moan)
(Bob) Go on!
Go on!
- (Moaning intensifies) - (Bob) Yes, yes!
- (Bob) Ohh, ohh, oh.
- (Rita groans)
Is that all she's getting?
I thought I were great.
(Urine splashes)
- (Sue whispers) Did you like it?
- (Rita) His legs weren't half hairy.
(They snigger)
I think he's great.
He certainly knows how to give a lass a good time.
Can't half go like t'clappers.
I wonder if he'll bring us here again.
Oh, he will.
Make no mistake about that.
(Whistling)
(Door creaks)
- Where the fuck have you been?
- Babysitting.
Not till two o'clock in the fuckin' morning you haven't.
- Don't lie to me, lass.
- I'm not.
You ask me mum.
Well, your mum's a lying bastard an' all.
- I'll wrap this round your neck.
- Oh!
- Mum!
- What?
- Come and tell him!
- (Dad) You're a lying little shit!
Oh, I'm fucking fed up on him.
I wish he'd take his bloody hook.
- (Sue) Don't we all?
- What are you playing at?
Do not try to tell me that she's been babysitting till this fucking time.
- (Mum) How do you know she hasn't?
- Because there's nowt open.
- There is!
- Nightclubs.
I don't fucking believe you, and next time I will wrap it round your neck.
Just be careful I don't bloody wrap it around yours.
Why don't you fuck off back to bed?
I'm sleeping in here.
You're sleeping on your bloody own.
- Do what you like.
- I bloody will.
Don't worry.
Anyhow.
- Fuck it, I'm going to bed.
- Oh, go on.
Aren't you going to bed?
I'm not getting in with him.
I've summat to say to you.
- What's that?
- You're up to summat, you are.
I'm not.
I've been babysitting, that's all.
Not till this time you haven't.
Anyway, get off to bed, I'll see you in't morning.
You're a lying swine, so you must think I fell out the bloody tree.
Oh.
- Mum!
- (Dad mumbles drunkenly)
- Can I borrow ya cardigan?
- No.
Oh, Mum, where's me homework gone?
- It's on there, in't it?
- Please!
- Oh, it's not, it's gone!
- It were on there when I got up.
- Go on, Sue.
- Well, it can't just disappear.
- Are you gonna lend it?
- No!
See if it's dropped down t'back.
(Brother) I'm having a 5p Round Robin.
(Toilet flushes)
- Any of you two seen me homework?
- I'll try Yankee.
Oi, is this it?
- Yeah, it fucking is.
Give it back.
- We're using it.
Oh, Mum, tell him, I'll get done.
I've got to hand it in.
Can I have me cookery money?
What fucking cookery money?
No, you can't.
If that teacher wants you to make buns, tell her to give you t'money.
I'm not gonna tell her that.
- I'll tell her.
- You bloody won't!
I don't want everybody to know what I can and cannot afford.
Fuck it!
(Dog barking)
Thank you.
I thank you.
Thank you, all.
Thank you.
Thank you, now.
Morning.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
(Tinny music through headphones)
Thank you.
I thank you.
I thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
- I've got mine, have you got yours?
- Thank you.
What's this?
2.45, Miss Love, Ripon.
- (Rita) Horse-racing, sir.
- (Laughter)
Horse-racing?
(Sue) Me brothers were using it to write their bets on, sir.
(Laughter)
This looks like a lively piece, Sue.
Should be.
Took me long enough to do.
(Giggling)
Is it worth me putting anything on Miss Love, do you think?
Well, it's strongly fancied.
(Laughter)
What are we going to do tonight, then?
Oh, fuck knows.
Not much we can do, is there?
So we'll just be walking round again.
Well, can you come up with any better ideas?
- Bob's really nice, in't he?
- (They chuckle)
I could live with a fella like that, as long as he weren't doing wi' me what he's doing with his wife.
Ooh, you can't expect owt else, can you?
Cor, if I had a fella like him, I'd expect him to do it.
You wouldn't be bothered if he was goin' with all t'lasses he could get?
Well, what you don't know don't hurt you, does it?
(Both laugh)

Luna Kars.
Yeah, where do you want to go?
Right, it's on its way.
Driver three, a passenger at the Exchange called Saunders.
Wants to go to Leeds.
What are you staring at?
- Just looking at you.
- Don't bother.
You wouldn't like me staring at you, would ya?
That's what you're doing now.
- She's all right, in't she?
- I wanna take her to bed.
You wouldn't know what to do with her.
(Man) I want a taxi now.
- Where do you want to go?
- Take me to Thorpe Edge.
- Bet I get her first.
- Bet you don't.
- (Sue) Driver five, Thorpe Edge.
- How much?
- Fiver.
- (Sue) Luna Kars.
All right, you're on.
Where do you want to go?
What time do you want it for?
It's on its way.
- Can I take you out tonight?
- Why?
So you can get me in bed?
He sleeps on a bed of nails.
Spikes.
You'll wake up covered in little pricks.
You're better off with me.
A big one, don't you mean?
I'm serious, you know.
I'm not like him.
You can get lost.
(Phone)
Luna Kars?
Yeah, where'd you want to go?
OK, it's on its way.
Bye.
Here, have a swig of that.
- No, thanks.
- Get it down you.
It's good for you.

(Background chatter, whistle blows)
(Both hum)
(Girl) I'm going to teacher.
(Whistle blows)
(Rita groans)
(Whispers) Rita.
Rita.
Bob.
Go on.
Hello, Sue.
You all right?
- What do you want?
- Miss, can I go to toilet, please?
You should have gone before the lesson.
- Ahh, take no notice of her.
- I'd be pleased if you'd shut up.
And you can go back and get on with the game.
- Let me go to toilet, miss, please.
- Get back to your game.
I can't.
Rita's not there.
I haven't got a partner.
- You'd better play with Sylvia.
- Aw, do I have to?
Yes.
Now get going, the pair of you.
Well, come on then!
(Girl) Ow!
That was my hand!
Go on, girls, keep it going!
That's it you two.
Just keep it going!
Are you sure they won't mind us being here?
No, or they wouldn't have given me t'key.
- Where'd you say they'd gone?
- Spain.
They must have a fair bit of money to have a house like this.
They're not short of a bob or two.
(He snorts)
Are we going to do something then, cos I've got to get home soon?
- I'm not bothered.
- That's what we came for, in't it?
Yeah.
Go on, then.
Get undressed.
Not if you're gonna watch me.
You haven't got nothing I haven't seen before.
Have you?
Pull the curtains, then, so nobody can see us.
Them over t'road might find it strange, seeing someone pulling curtains this time of day.
Might think we're burglars.
Well, what we going to do, then?
We could, erm...
get under the bed clothes.
Yeah, why not?
(Giggling)
(They laugh)
(Radio) 'Janet would like to say happy birthday to her husband Jim.
'They've been married four years, and not a day of it she regrets.
'Happy birthday, Jim.
He's that many years old.
'I'm not one to say.
'Also from twins...'

Me and Joe were having a laugh at the pub blowing them up.
- Sorry, but I don't believe you.
- Go and ask Joe yourself.
You're a lying bastard.
You've been out and about again.
- Don't be silly.
- Do you think I'm thick?
I know you been pissing about.
How do you know anything?
Staying out till all hours in the morning.
- Making stupid excuses.
- So what?
I bet it was that dirty little bitch you were screwing before.
The trouble with you, Bob, is you're sex mad.
- Oh, don't be daft, woman.
- (Doorbell)
It'd better not be Susan or Rita...
What's the...?
Do you think I'd play about with those two?
Well, it's funny.
When you take them home, you take a long time for such a short journey.
I'll tell you why I went with someone else, but let's get one thing clear.
It's not Susan or Rita.
(Doorbell)
And I'm blaming you for this.
Blaming me?
What for?
For me having ask for sex off other people, cos I don't get any off you.
Don't tell lies.
OK, I try, but when we have sex, it feels like shagging a bag of spuds.
You just lay there like a bit of wet rag.
- You didn't used to be like that.
- What do you expect?
I want us to enjoy it.
What's the use of doing it if you're not going to enjoy it?
- It's not dirty.
Everybody does it.
- I know, but you expect too much.
You what?
Once a week?
- Is that too much?
- I think it is.
- Well, I don't.
- Please don't argue with me, Bob.
I'll try.
I promise you.
But why couldn't you talk to me about it?
What's the use?
You wouldn't have listened.
It's only when I do something you listen to me.
Well, I'm sorry, but it's not an easy subject for me to talk about.
There's nowt to be ashamed of.
(Footsteps going upstairs)
(Doorbell)
Well, don't just stand there.
Come in.
- Didn't you hear us?
- I'll have to fix that door bell.
I keep telling Michelle to remind me, but does she?
She forgets.
- Where is she, anyway?
- In the bedroom.
Go up if you want.
She might start asking you questions, so be careful what you say.
I'll tell you when I take you home later.
(TV) 'So, quarter of an hour to go, nil-nil.'
Don't you think it's a bit low at the bust.
Is it 'ell.
I think it'd look better if you didn't have a bra on.
I'll have to wear a bra.
When I'm dancing, all the fellas'll be watchin' me tits wobbling'.
- I can't do with that.
- (All laugh)
I think I'll wear this one.
(Both) Mm.
Yes, that's better.
What time does Bob usually drop you off home?
- 'Bout a quarter past eleven.
- Yeah, something like that.
Why, is there something wrong?
Don't say anything to Bob, will you?
- We hardly talk to him, do we?
- No.
I think he's playing about.
Found a packet of Durex in his pocket tonight.
- He might've bought 'em for you.
- If he did, there was no need.
I was sterilised two and a half years ago.
- Oh.
- I've dreaded this happening again.
- (Both) He's done it before?
- Only the once.
Did you know her?
She used to babysit for me.
To look at her, you wouldn't think butter would melt in her mouth.
You know what they say, quietest are t'worst.
How did you find out?
- She left her bracelet in the bed.
- Your bed?
Otherwise, I still wouldn't have known to this day.
- Who'd you think it is this time?
- Same one.
What you going to do about it?
- Nothing.
- Nothin'?
That's the best thing I can do.
I don't want Bob to leave me.
I love him too much.
I know he didn't mean it.
He'd never leave me.
Or if he did, he'd be back in a couple of days.

(Rita) Did you hear her say, "Bob will never leave me"?
- Yeah!
- I'd piss meself laughing if he did.
Oh!
Oh, no.
I don't think I would.
I don't think I'd actually like to see 'em split up meself.

What would you do if she did find out?
I'd deny it.
If it came to it, and she stood there and asked me,
I think I'd tell her.
I'd worm me way out of it.
Well, it'd save a lot of trouble all round, wouldn't it?
(Giggling)
(Door opens)
Would either of you like a cup of tea?
- Yes, please.
- Yes, please.
Are we going to have a jump tonight?
Shh.
Keep your voice down.
- Well, are we?
- I'll see what I can do.
We know what you can do.
- Right, Sue?
- Right, Reet.
Shh, shh, shh.
Can you babysit for us a week on Wednesday?
Er, yeah, what time?
Well, we'll be going out between 7.30 and 8:00, so if you could come over between 7:00 and 7.30.
It's our Julie's engagement party.
Oh, was she here the first time we babysat?
- That was Angela.
- Is she married?
She was.
She got divorced about a year or so ago.
Two of my brothers are also divorced.
There's three divorced in the same family?
There might be four yet.
- Don't be so bloody funny.
- Ooh, you're a moody sod.
- I was only joking with you.
- You shouldn't say things like that.
- Not in front of other people.
- Sorry, I didn't mean nothing wrong.
Watch what you say.
You and me will fall outwith one another.
I said sorry.
Will you keep quiet?
You'll start an argument again.
- That won't be nowt fresh, will it?
- You love to do this to me.
Do what?
Make me look small in front of other people.
And I don't know what you two are grinning about.
I don't find it so funny.
(Bob) Stop getting funny with them.
Well, if you'd keep your mouth shut, they wouldn't need to laugh at me, would they?
Don't be silly.
They're not laughing at you.
It's just a nervous laugh, because they don't know what else to do.
Make your own fucking tea.
(Alarm rings)
That Michelle pissed it right up, didn't she?
Never mind.
We'll see him soon.
We're not babysitting till next Wednesday.
- We won't get a jump for a week.
- You're not that desperate, are you?
- No.
- Well, shut up then.
(Bob) Can't you turn that bloody light off?
I want to go to sleep.
I'll turn it off in a minute, love.
Just let me finish reading this page.
I don't see why I should after the way you behaved tonight.
Look, Bob, I didn't mean that.
I just thought you were going with Susan and Rita.
Oh, how many times do I have to tell you?
I am not and have never been with Susan or Rita.
- Do we have to talk about this?
- Yes, we do.
If you've got anything to ask, you better do it, now.
Do you love me, Bob?
- You what?
- I said, do you love me?
Oh, Michelle, course I do.
If I didn't I wouldn't be here, would I?
I don't know.
Would ya?
- Don't be silly.
- I'm not being silly.
You know what I think about you.
I know.
But you got to realise, all this is very hard for me.
Getting accused of going with other people.
It's not very nice.
I know you like sex, but Why'd you have to go with somebody else?
Let's face it.
You're not being very good about it, are you?
I just don't seem to like it nowadays.
I know I should try.
It's not hard to do.
Just relax.
Enjoy it.
OK, I'll try.
Give us a kiss.
Turn the lamp off, Bob.
(Michelle) I wish you wouldn't put your tongue in my mouth.
(Girls giggle)
Come on, girls.
Keep going, now.
No talking.
Give me those cigarettes!
- (Rita) Oh, look at state of that.
- Crap, innit?
Can you imagine trying to have a jump wi' that on?
Forgot to ring me boyfriend.
He'll do his nut.
- Rung mine earlier.
- I'll be glad to see him.
Why?
Can't you wait to get to bed with him?
- We don't do things like that.
- Haven't you been to bed with him?
We don't believe in sex before marriage.
I'm still a virgin.
They don't call me Susan.
Watch what you say or I'll knock your head off.
Yeah?
You and whose army?
I don't need nobody.
I can do it meself.
- Don't argue with her.
- Keep out of it, you.
At least I don't do it with married men.
- Nor do I.
- Liar.
I've seen you get in his car.
What's it to do with you anyway?
Do you want him?
I wouldn't touch him with a barge pole.
He's been near you.
You're only jealous.
He'd take one look at you and run.
Who'd you think you are?
Miss World?
- I'm the best, so don't forget it.
- (All) Oooooh!
(Church bell)
- Look at that slut.
- Don't.
She's not worth it.
She's a stuck-up bastard.
She won't be with my fist down her throat.
- You're a pair of dirty slags!
- Don't call me a slag, you bitch!
- Take your 'ands off me!
- What you going to do about it?
- Someone'll get the teacher.
- Go on.
See if I'm bothered.
You can't do it now!
Can't I?
How do you like that, then?
- Sir!
- Call me a slag if you dare.
- Slag!
- What?
- Susan's just hit me.
- What for?
I told her I know she's bothering with a married man.
Is this true?
Take no notice, sir.
She's dreaming.
She called me a slag so I hit her.
(Teacher) Get back to the coach.
I'm sick of this.
- Come on, girls, it's a disgrace.
- Come on, back to the coach.
Call this a day out?
You've wrecked it.
Get a move on!
Come on!
- Come on, girls, get a move on!
- (Laughter)
Get a move on, girls, come on!
Never mind talking.
Move yourselves down.
(Laughter)
I hope my mum doesn't find out I'm off school.
- She'll keep me in all week.
- She won't.
Hurry up.
I've never seen you move so quick.
Are you that desperate for a jump?
- I could be.
- I could shag the arse off him too.
I bet you could!
(Sue) Right, last one over the Wall's an ugly cow!
Whoo!
- (Bob) Come on, Rita.
- (Rita) That's not fair!
You had a better start.
(Bob and Sue laugh)
(Bob) Come on, Rita, we're over here!
- (Bob and Sue) Boo!
- (Rita yelps, Sue laughs)
Why do you two always leave me behind?
- We don't mean to, do we, Sue?
- Course not.
She's knows that.
- Ooh, what's that on your shoe?
- It's cow shit!
Oh, where the bleeding hell did that come from?
- It didn't fall out of sky.
- Ohhh!
- Wipe your shoe on the grass.
- Dirty pissing cow.
- (Bob) Watch where you walk.
- Cows shouldn't shit everywhere.
(Sue) What do you expect them to do?
Go in one corner of the field?
Or shall I ask the farmer to install a toilet and train 'em to shit in it?
I wish they bleedin' would.
God, it don't half pong.
Here, Sue!
- Oh, piss off, Rita.
- Bob!
I don't want to smell it, thanks.
- He don't want to smell it, thanks.
- Well, I don't!
Anyway, you might have sweaty feet.
You cheeky bleeder!
I had a bath last night, I'll have you know!
You'll be needing another one when you get home with t'cow shit here.
I hope I don't get any on me and Michelle sees it.
Oh, look, there's a fresh dollop of shit.
Look at all t'flies on it.
Next time, you know, they'll be in your house.
Walking all over your tea.
Give over, Rita.
- (Rita) Bob?
- What?
Are we gonna... well, you know?
What's "Well, you know?"
What's she means is, are we going to have a jump?
- Why?
- That's what we're here for, innit?
- Oh, it is, it is, yeah.
- I'm going first.
- Why can't I?
- Because you can't.
I always have to go second!
What difference does it make?
You get the same thing.
- That's not fair.
I wanna go first.
- Why?
Because when I go second, it's not so good.
You're knackered.
- Why can't Sue go second?
- Will you go second, Sue?
If it'll stop her complaining, I suppose I'll have to.
- Why should you always get the best?
- There's no need to argue.
- I only wanna go first for a change.
- (Sue) Nobody's stoppin' you.
One of you stop outside t'car.
I'm sick of getting squashed.
(Sue) Let Rita go first.
I'll wait outside t'car.
You randy little basket.
- Reet.
- Ohh.
(Laughter)
(Rita) on.
I hope you're not going to be all day.
(Bob muffled) I can't do it like this.
I'm too squashed.
(Rita) Can you take the weight off me legs?
They're killing me.
- What you doing?
- (Bob) Trying to get comfortable.
I can't hear a word you're saying!
I said I'm trying to get comfortable.
Oh.
What's the matter, Bob?
I can't get an 'ard-on.
- Course you can.
- I'm telling you I can't.
Why not?
It don't seem to want to.
- Does that mean I can't have a jump?
- Looks that way.
- What's going on in there?
- He can't get an 'ard-on!
(Laughs)
It's not bloody funny!
- I find this rather embarrassing.
- Never mind.
At least you tried.
For the first time I get to go first and you can't get an 'ard-on.
- I'm sorry.
- Never mind.
Get dressed.
I want to go home.
- Better luck next time, Reet.
- Shut your face, you!
- I'm glad I didn't go first now.
- I'm sorry.
I really am.
I feel so embarrassed.
I wouldn't let it worry you.
Poor Rita.
Will you get lost, you?
It's not bleeding funny!
You wouldn't like it if it happened to you!
It didn't, did it?
You should've let me go first.
We'd have been OK then.
- Piss off.
- Poor little Rita.
- Bob, tell her.
- Give over now.
It's not funny.
- (Sue) I know it's not.
- Don't joke about it then!
(Sue) I'm sorry.
(Sue stifles laughter)
I don't know why it is.
Just feeling a bit off today.

Yes, come in.

What are they doing here?
What the fuck have you been up to?
- Pinching husbands!
- You dirty little bastard.

- (Rita) Nowt!
That's what you get for mixing with sluts like her.
You tell her!
Go on, Sue!
- Give over shouting, you!
- I want you.
- What a fucking daughter you've got.
- What about your dirty husband?
What the fuck's been...
You with these two?
- I haven't been doin' fuck all.
- My husband is not a dirty bastard.
It's your daughter and her mate.
Are you satisfied now?
Stop blaming me.
It's as much your fault as it is mine.
- (Dad) It's all you's fault.
- It's your husband.
It's your daughter.
If it's put there on a plate, he's going to take it.
He wouldn't be much of a man if he did owt else.
All of you's to blame.
I want to find out what's been going on!

Ha-ha!
Up the IRA!
Don't you stick your oar in.
I'll flatten you, you bastard!

- Keep your mouth shut!
- Well...
Is that what you've been saying, you dirty bastard?
See what you've tried to cause.
Now you've done it.
- (Sue) Get fucked, will you?
- Fuck you and your mate.
21 Manningham Lane!
- It's the best place for 'em!
- It's the best place for you!
- Will you let me go?
- Can't stand trouble you've caused?
Me and Sue's caused.
No, that's why I'm going.
You're not.
I 'aven't finished wi' you yet, you slut.
(Man on balcony whistles)
(Bob) Let her fucking go.
Better than Match Of The Day, this.
(Both) Well?
(Both) Well?
(Horn)
(Horns blaring, shouting)
(Screaming and yelling)
Come on, Rita!
Get on.
(Dogs barking, yelling, horns blaring)
Mavis, we're going home.
You dirty, mucky, filthy, lying, fucking bastard of a husband!
I hate you.
(Car horn)
Is that the lot?
You won't get much more in there.
That'll do for now.
(Tyres screech)
Michelle?
Michelle!
You bitch!
- Reet!
- Oh, hiya, come in!
Oh, get ready.
We're going to be late.
Oh, fuck school.
I'm not going any more.
- Why not?
- Because I'm not.
Oh, and don't start getting on at me.
I had enough yesterday.
We've only got two weeks and then we leave.
Well, I'm leaving two weeks early.
Anyway, I've got summat to tell you about Bob.
What?
In't he meeting us no more?
- I'm moving in with him.
- You're what?
- He asked me and I said yeah.
- The dirty bastard!
He wants me to go today.
Well, of all the dirty tricks.
- I never thought he'd do this.
- I never thought he'd ask me.
You maybe, but me?
I can hardly believe it.
- And are you going?
- Course I am.
- You dirty cow.
- Why am I?
- Just leaving me like that.
- He asked me.
Anyway, what's your mum have to say about this?
Only the usual crap.
I'm too young.
It won't last.
All that stuff.
I thought she might have stopped it.
Well, it's a bit late now, Sue.
I'm pregnant.
Don't talk bleeding daft.
How can you be?
He always used johnnies.
Oh, no, he didn't.
I used to meet him, many a time, and never told you.
- Didn't he tell you that?
- No, he fucking didn't, the sly bastard!
Do what you want!
I'm not bothered!
Don't be like that, Sue.
We can still be friends.
No point.
You'll only be accusing me of getting off wi' him.
Don't be silly.
How would you feel if it were the other way round?
Bet you wouldn't be chuffed, would you?
No, you're right.
I wouldn't.
I'm sorry, Sue.
(Car horn)
Jesus, it's Bob.
I'm not even dressed.
You better hurry up then.
Huh.
You don't want him to see you like that.
Why not?
From now on, he'll see me like this every morning.
(Car horn)
- Has she told you, then?
- Yeah, why?
- Well, aren't you bothered?
- Should I be?
- I thought you would've been.
- Course I'm fucking bothered.
That's my best mate you're going off with.
Well, you can still see her.
And me... if you'll still meet me.
No, thanks.
I won't be meeting you no more.
- Why not?
- I'm not doing the dirty on Rita.
And I don't think you should.
- Well, it's ta-ra, then.
- Never mind the ta-ras, get gone.
- See you, Sue.
- (Sue) Yeah, sure.
See ya, Reet.
Wish ya all the luck in the world.
(Speaking Urdu)
What they saying, Aslam?
He's just telling her how much he loves her.
Why can't it have subtitles?
Because it's a Pakistani cinema.
What's she doing that for?
As soon as she stops, they kill her boyfriend.
- Does she stop?
- Don't talk while film's showing.
- Does she?
- I don't know.
- Would you do that for me?
- Would I hell.
(Audience) Shh!
Sue?
Will you be me girlfriend?
I don't know yet.
We'll think about it.
I like you a lot.
That's nice.
- Will you, then?
- We'll see.
There's plenty of time to think about it.
I won't bother you that much.
I've never been out with a Paki before.
Then again, I don't suppose you'd be different from any other man.
Can I, er, put my arm round you?
- What for?
- I just want to.
That's all.
Well, go on, then.
If you want to.
You don't mind, do you?
Not really.
How about a...
lay down now?
Can do.
(Aslam rubs his hands)
Can I kiss you?
Why do ya keep asking me if you can do this or do that?
- Just do it if you must.
- Thanks.
I don't mean you can strip me naked or anything like that.
(He chuckles)
(They giggle)
(Thumping rock music)
Get out!
Go on!
Get out!
Get out!
Bloody mutt.
(Dog barks)
(TV) '...and the fight is all about man's best friend.
'This danger to our children's health is a threat.
'We've asked the council to do something, 'we go to endless meetings, nothing has been done.'
(Mum) Watch me ornaments.
They're all right.
You'll not get a bleeding job sitting on your arse in here.
Listen who's talking.
You haven't done a day's work in years.
There's no way I'm workin' all week for £27.30 on some bleedin' training' scheme.
You should be thankful for it.
(Mum) Give over.
Even I wouldn't work for that.
I used to work for 18 shillings.
That were in t'days of Methuselah.
Money were worth more then.
You get nowt for 27.30 nowadays.
(Aslam) Yes, I must say, I agree with Sue.
You keep out of this, you black bastard.
- There's no need for that.
- Get out!
Go on!
Get out!
And don't come back!
Else I'll smash them fucking black brains out your black head!
- I can't help being a Paki.
- Yes, you fucking can.
- You shouldn't interfere.
- Nor should you.
You always tell folk what they should do and you haven't done it yourself.
I've done some things.
You've done nowt and you've been nowt all your life.
Anyhow...
I'm going to have a lie down.
And when I get up, I want them two out of it.
Oh, go to bed!
Fucking going.
Come on, Aslam.
We're going.
He won't remember what he said when he gets up.
I don't care.
I'm not stopping around to listen to him every time he's been out drinking.
If you want, we can go to me sister's.
At least we'll be welcome there.
(Toilet flushes)
(Farting)
(Speaks Urdu)
You like Pakistan?
You go with Aslam?
Yes?
I don't know.
I've never been abroad.
(Aslam translates)
(Speaks Urdu)
Nice place.
Nice people.
See Aslam mum.
- I don't like flying.
- (Aslam translates)
(Speaks Urdu)
Nice, not hurt.
I don't know.
I might go some day.
(Aslam translates)
(Speaks Urdu)
OK, think.
Why won't you come to Pakistan?
Cos I've read it in t'paper, about Paki fellas taking their women and children over and fucking leaving them.
- Don't be silly.
- I 'ave!
You'd probably sell me to some old Paki who couldn't walk.
I wouldn't sell you.
Nobody" 'ave you.
Well, you'll never get me there anyway, will you?
(Both laugh)
- So, what you doing now then?
- I'm living with a lad, Aslam.
- Who?
- A Paki?
- We live at his sister's.
- Do you like it?
Not really.
It's not the place.
It's his sister I can't stand.
She won't let us sleep together.
- When you coming out?
- Tomorrow, I hope.
- Sorry you lost the baby, Reet.
- It's all right.
Course it is.
We'll be able to have others.
Oh, have you 'eard it?
I know.
He'd love it for me to be banged up all t'time.
Yeah, think about all t'family allowance we'd get.
Fuck the family allowance.
It's not you that'd look after 'em.
You tell him, Reet.
I've missed you, you know.
I bet you have.
I'm not taking you straight home.
- I'm taking you up on t'moors.
- You are not!
Come on, don't be so rotten.
I'm dying for a jump.
That's your problem.
Not mine.
I like you.
A lot.
Don't talk rubbish.
Just take me home.
Whoo!
- (Car horn)
- Go on!
You thought I didn't see you, didn't you?
See what?
You've been with that fella, haven't you?
You haven't been to the hospital.
It were just an excuse!
That was Rita's fella.
He was giving me a lift home from t'hospital.
I bet he was.
Ask Rita when you see her if you don't believe me.
- I will.
- Ow!
Don't let me see you with another fella or I'll break your neck.
Fucking hell.

- What do you want?
Can I speak to Susie?
Please open the door.
I only want to talk to her for a minute.
Please, open the door.
I beg of you.
(Mouths words)
No.
Please, I promise, I won't try owt.
She's not opening that door.
Go on, please.
Just for one minute.
- (Sue) Why'd you want me to?
- So I can speak to you.
(Rita) Speak to her through the window.
What do you want to speak to me about?
Please.
Come back.
I won't do it again.
Please.
Sure.
You've said that before, you lying bastard.
I know.
I promise you this time.
Take no notice.
They all say that.
Please, you're breaking my heart!
Quick!

Aah!
I hope somebody breaks yours one day!
Yeah, but it won't be you, will it?
Please come back.
I'll give you anything.
Can't you get it into your head she don't want to?
Now, get lost!
I'll do something to meself if she doesn't.
(Sue) Like what?
I've got tablets.
I'll take 'em if you don't come back.
Well, go on, then.
See if I'm bothered.
Pass us some water, then.
It'll be my pleasure.

Here's your water.
Where's your tablets?

Go on then.
Rita didn't get you the water for nowt.
- What's he doing?
- Taking tablets.
- What's he take tablets for?
- He doesn't.
- He reckons he's taking an overdose.
- Oh!
I'm takin' 'em.
You'll stand there and watch me do it, won't you?
Yeah, if I bloody had to!
I've got a stomach ache.

I will not.

- What you calling it a Durex for?
- Durex is t'proper name for 'em.
- Oh, I didn't know.
I've never had any use for 'em meself.
Can you put one on?
I wouldn't know what to do with one.
Would either of you like to try?
- Not me.
- Or me.
You can just tell us.
I thought you might like to try for yourselves.
No, I don't think we should.
OK.
- First you need an erection.
- An e-what-tion?
- An erection.
- What's that?
I don't know.
- Do you know what an 'ard-on is?
- Yeah.
OK, first you need an 'ard-on, and then you take the rubber johnny as you call it out the packet.
You didn't think we thought you could put packet on, did ya?
So, what happens if it tears?
Not good, then.
The sperm can get out and fertilise the egg.
We haven't got eggs inside us.
We're not ducks, you know.
- Can this come off inside you?
- No.
What do mean exactly when you say "the sperm"?
It's what a man ejaculates.
Shoots his muck, you'd say.
Nobody ever tell you that?
- No.
- All we did at school were drawings of the male and female sex organs.
Didn't your mam or dad tell you owt?
Talk like that's dirty in our house.
If say owt like that, I get a belt.
My mam never wants to talk about it neither.
Anyway, what have we stopped here for?
And what we talking about rubber johnnies for?
You were supposed to take us for a ride.
We stopped cos I just wanted to talk to you.
- Find out more about you.
- What for?
Well, things haven't been going too well with me and the wife.
Tell us another one.
It's got reclining seats, this car.
What you want us to do about it?
What do you think, then?
I'll let you know.
Try laying on it if you want.
Might as well.
What do you think you're doing?
- Don't you like it?
- Yeah.
- Why don't you do it to her?
- I will...
After I finish with you.
- Are you sure you can manage two?
- You bet your boots I can.
Get your knickers off.
- Do I have to?
- I can't do nothing with them on.
- Can't I put 'em halfway down?
- You won't be able to move.
I'll tell you what, I'll take 'em off on one leg.
I'll just watch if it's all right.
Right.
Lay down.
Jesus, it looks like a frozen sausage.
- Shift your bum up a bit.
- You what?
- I'm talking to Sue.
- I'm sorry.
That's not much better, but it'll do.
- How long will you be?
- As long as it takes.
OK.
OK!
- Can you shift your leg, Sue?
- What you doing?
I'm trying to get it in, if you'd shut your mouth for a minute.
Can I turn the cassette on?
For fuck's sake!
What do you want that on for?
I want to listen to it.
Rita!
- What?
- Shut up, or you'll stand outside.
I'm sorry, but I'm bored.
You won't be when I've finished here.
Well, go on then, get on with it!
Go on!
Yeah!
Ohh.
Did you enjoy that, Sue?
Yeah.
Right, come on then, moaning Minnie!
I'm coming!
Hey, you haven't got much room to do it in here, have you?
- It's all me and Sue had.
- I'm not complaining, just saying.
- Will you get your head off me leg!
- I'm sorry!
Come on now, Rita, if you don't want to do it, just say.
I do want to do it.
Hey, Reet, I should move your leg over, it'll hurt you like mad.
Go on, Bob, get stuck in there!
Go on!
Go on!
Go on!
Yes, yes!
Ohh, ohh, oh.
Is that all she's getting?
I thought I were great.
- Did you like it?
- His legs weren't half hairy.
I think he's great.
He certainly knows how to give a lass a good time.
Can't half go like t'clappers.
I wonder if he'll bring us here again.
Oh, he will.
Make no mistake about that.
- Where the fuck have you been?
- Babysitting.
Not till two o'clock in the fuckin' morning you haven't.
- Don't lie to me, lass.
- I'm not.
You ask me mum.
Well, your mum's a lying bastard an' all.
- I'll wrap this round your neck.
- Oh!
- Mum!
- What?
- Come and tell him!
- You're a lying little shit!
Oh, I'm fucking fed up on him.
I wish he'd take his bloody hook.
- Don't we all?
- What are you playing at?
Do not try to tell me that she's been babysitting till this fucking time.
- How do you know she hasn't?
- Because there's nowt open.
- There is!
- Nightclubs.
I don't fucking believe you, and next time I will wrap it round your neck.
Just be careful I don't bloody wrap it around yours.
Why don't you fuck off back to bed?
I'm sleeping in here.
You're sleeping on your bloody own.

- I bloody will.
Don't worry.
Anyhow.

Aren't you going to bed?
I'm not getting in with him.

- What's that?
- You're up to summat, you are.
I'm not.
I've been babysitting, that's all.
Not till this time you haven't.
Anyway, get off to bed, I'll see you in't morning.
You're a lying swine, so you must think I fell out the bloody tree.

Oh, Mum, tell him, I'll get done.

No, you can't.
If that teacher wants you to make buns, tell her to give you t'money.

Horse-racing, sir.
Horse-racing?
Me brothers were using it to write their bets on, sir.
This looks like a lively piece, Sue.
Should be.
Took me long enough to do.
Is it worth me putting anything on Miss Love, do you think?
Well, it's strongly fancied.
What are we going to do tonight, then?
Oh, fuck knows.
Not much we can do, is there?
So we'll just be walking round again.
Well, can you come up with any better ideas?
Bob's really nice, in't he?
I could live with a fella like that, as long as he weren't doing wi' me what he's doing with his wife.
Ooh, you can't expect owt else, can you?
Cor, if I had a fella like him, I'd expect him to do it.
You wouldn't be bothered if he was goin' with all t'lasses he could get?
Well, what you don't know don't hurt you, does it?
Luna Kars.
Yeah, where do you want to go?
Right, it's on its way.
Driver three, a passenger at the Exchange called Saunders.
Wants to go to Leeds.
What are you staring at?
- Just looking at you.
- Don't bother.
You wouldn't like me staring at you, would ya?
That's what you're doing now.
- She's all right, in't she?
- I wanna take her to bed.
You wouldn't know what to do with her.
I want a taxi now.
- Where do you want to go?
- Take me to Thorpe Edge.
- Bet I get her first.
- Bet you don't.
- Driver five, Thorpe Edge.
- How much?
- Fiver.
- Luna Kars.
All right, you're on.
Where do you want to go?
What time do you want it for?
It's on its way.
- Can I take you out tonight?
- Why?
So you can get me in bed?
He sleeps on a bed of nails.
Spikes.
You'll wake up covered in little pricks.
You're better off with me.
A big one, don't you mean?
I'm serious, you know.
I'm not like him.
You can get lost.
Luna Kars?
Yeah, where'd you want to go?
OK, it's on its way.
Bye.
Here, have a swig of that.
- No, thanks.
- Get it down you.
It's good for you.
I'm going to teacher.
Rita.
Rita.
Bob.
Go on.
Hello, Sue.
You all right?
- What do you want?
- Miss, can I go to toilet, please?
You should have gone before the lesson.
- Ahh, take no notice of her.
- I'd be pleased if you'd shut up.
And you can go back and get on with the game.
- Let me go to toilet, miss, please.
- Get back to your game.
I can't.
Rita's not there.
I haven't got a partner.
- You'd better play with Sylvia.
- Aw, do I have to?
Yes.
Now get going, the pair of you.
Well, come on then!
Ow!
That was my hand!
Go on, girls, keep it going!
That's it you two.
Just keep it going!
Are you sure they won't mind us being here?
No, or they wouldn't have given me t'key.
- Where'd you say they'd gone?
- Spain.
They must have a fair bit of money to have a house like this.
They're not short of a bob or two.
Are we going to do something then, cos I've got to get home soon?
- I'm not bothered.
- That's what we came for, in't it?
Yeah.
Go on, then.
Get undressed.
Not if you're gonna watch me.
You haven't got nothing I haven't seen before.
Have you?
Pull the curtains, then, so nobody can see us.
Them over t'road might find it strange, seeing someone pulling curtains this time of day.
Might think we're burglars.
Well, what we going to do, then?
We could, erm...
get under the bed clothes.
Yeah, why not?
'Janet would like to say happy birthday to her husband Jim.
'They've been married four years, and not a day of it she regrets.
'Happy birthday, Jim.
He's that many years old.
'I'm not one to say.
'Also from twins...'
'...husband Jim, daughter Sarah...'

What the bloody hell are you doing with a packet of these?
Me and Joe were having a laugh at the pub blowing them up.
- Sorry, but I don't believe you.
- Go and ask Joe yourself.
You're a lying bastard.
You've been out and about again.
- Don't be silly.
- Do you think I'm thick?
I know you been pissing about.
How do you know anything?
Staying out till all hours in the morning.
- Making stupid excuses.
- So what?
I bet it was that dirty little bitch you were screwing before.
The trouble with you, Bob, is you're sex mad.
Oh, don't be daft, woman.
It'd better not be Susan or Rita...
What's the...?
Do you think I'd play about with those two?
Well, it's funny.
When you take them home, you take a long time for such a short journey.
I'll tell you why I went with someone else, but let's get one thing clear.
It's not Susan or Rita.
And I'm blaming you for this.
Blaming me?
What for?
For me having ask for sex off other people, cos I don't get any off you.
Don't tell lies.
OK, I try, but when we have sex, it feels like shagging a bag of spuds.
You just lay there like a bit of wet rag.
- You didn't used to be like that.
- What do you expect?
I want us to enjoy it.
What's the use of doing it if you're not going to enjoy it?
- It's not dirty.
Everybody does it.
- I know, but you expect too much.
You what?
Once a week?
- Is that too much?
- I think it is.
- Well, I don't.
- Please don't argue with me, Bob.
I'll try.
I promise you.
But why couldn't you talk to me about it?
What's the use?
You wouldn't have listened.
It's only when I do something you listen to me.
Well, I'm sorry, but it's not an easy subject for me to talk about.
There's nowt to be ashamed of.
Well, don't just stand there.
Come in.
- Didn't you hear us?
- I'll have to fix that door bell.
I keep telling Michelle to remind me, but does she?
She forgets.
- Where is she, anyway?
- In the bedroom.
Go up if you want.
She might start asking you questions, so be careful what you say.
I'll tell you when I take you home later.
'So, quarter of an hour to go, nil-nil.'
Don't you think it's a bit low at the bust.
Is it 'ell.
I think it'd look better if you didn't have a bra on.
I'll have to wear a bra.
When I'm dancing, all the fellas'll be watchin' me tits wobbling'.
I can't do with that.
I think I'll wear this one.
Mm.
Yes, that's better.
What time does Bob usually drop you off home?
- 'Bout a quarter past eleven.
- Yeah, something like that.
Why, is there something wrong?
Don't say anything to Bob, will you?
- We hardly talk to him, do we?
- No.
I think he's playing about.
Found a packet of Durex in his pocket tonight.
- He might've bought 'em for you.
- If he did, there was no need.
I was sterilised two and a half years ago.
- Oh.
- I've dreaded this happening again.
- He's done it before?
- Only the once.
Did you know her?
She used to babysit for me.
To look at her, you wouldn't think butter would melt in her mouth.
You know what they say, quietest are t'worst.
How did you find out?
- She left her bracelet in the bed.
- Your bed?
Otherwise, I still wouldn't have known to this day.
- Who'd you think it is this time?
- Same one.
What you going to do about it?
- Nothing.
- Nothin'?
That's the best thing I can do.
I don't want Bob to leave me.
I love him too much.
I know he didn't mean it.
He'd never leave me.
Or if he did, he'd be back in a couple of days.
♪ I can't disguise it I'm so excited
♪ Hey, boy, ooh... ♪
Imagine being married to a woman who won't have sex.
Did you hear her say, "Bob will never leave me"?
- Yeah!
- I'd piss meself laughing if he did.
Oh!
Oh, no.
I don't think I would.
I don't think I'd actually like to see 'em split up meself.

What would you do if she did find out?
I'd deny it.
If it came to it, and she stood there and asked me,
I think I'd tell her.
I'd worm me way out of it.
Well, it'd save a lot of trouble all round, wouldn't it?
Would either of you like a cup of tea?
- Yes, please.
- Yes, please.
Are we going to have a jump tonight?
Shh.
Keep your voice down.
- Well, are we?
- I'll see what I can do.
We know what you can do.
- Right, Sue?
- Right, Reet.
Shh, shh, shh.
Can you babysit for us a week on Wednesday?
Er, yeah, what time?
Well, we'll be going out between 7.30 and 8:00, so if you could come over between 7:00 and 7.30.
It's our Julie's engagement party.
Oh, was she here the first time we babysat?
- That was Angela.
- Is she married?
She was.
She got divorced about a year or so ago.
Two of my brothers are also divorced.
There's three divorced in the same family?
There might be four yet.
- Don't be so bloody funny.
- Ooh, you're a moody sod.
- I was only joking with you.
- You shouldn't say things like that.
- Not in front of other people.
- Sorry, I didn't mean nothing wrong.
Watch what you say.
You and me will fall outwith one another.
I said sorry.
Will you keep quiet?
You'll start an argument again.
- That won't be nowt fresh, will it?
- You love to do this to me.
Do what?
Make me look small in front of other people.
And I don't know what you two are grinning about.
I don't find it so funny.
Stop getting funny with them.
Well, if you'd keep your mouth shut, they wouldn't need to laugh at me, would they?
Don't be silly.
They're not laughing at you.
It's just a nervous laugh, because they don't know what else to do.
Make your own fucking tea.
That Michelle pissed it right up, didn't she?
Never mind.
We'll see him soon.
We're not babysitting till next Wednesday.
- We won't get a jump for a week.
- You're not that desperate, are you?
- No.
- Well, shut up then.
Can't you turn that bloody light off?
I want to go to sleep.
I'll turn it off in a minute, love.
Just let me finish reading this page.
I don't see why I should after the way you behaved tonight.
Look, Bob, I didn't mean that.
I just thought you were going with Susan and Rita.
Oh, how many times do I have to tell you?
I am not and have never been with Susan or Rita.
- Do we have to talk about this?
- Yes, we do.
If you've got anything to ask, you better do it, now.
Do you love me, Bob?
- You what?
- I said, do you love me?
Oh, Michelle, course I do.
If I didn't I wouldn't be here, would I?
I don't know.
Would ya?
- Don't be silly.
- I'm not being silly.
You know what I think about you.
I know.
But you got to realise, all this is very hard for me.
Getting accused of going with other people.
It's not very nice.
I know you like sex, but Why'd you have to go with somebody else?
Let's face it.
You're not being very good about it, are you?
I just don't seem to like it nowadays.
I know I should try.
It's not hard to do.
Just relax.
Enjoy it.
OK, I'll try.
Give us a kiss.
Turn the lamp off, Bob.
I wish you wouldn't put your tongue in my mouth.
Come on, girls.
Keep going, now.
No talking.
Give me those cigarettes!
- Oh, look at state of that.
- Crap, innit?
Can you imagine trying to have a jump wi' that on?
Forgot to ring me boyfriend.
He'll do his nut.
- Rung mine earlier.
- I'll be glad to see him.
Why?
Can't you wait to get to bed with him?
- We don't do things like that.
- Haven't you been to bed with him?
We don't believe in sex before marriage.
I'm still a virgin.
They don't call me Susan.
Watch what you say or I'll knock your head off.
Yeah?
You and whose army?
I don't need nobody.
I can do it meself.
- Don't argue with her.
- Keep out of it, you.
At least I don't do it with married men.
- Nor do I.
- Liar.
I've seen you get in his car.
What's it to do with you anyway?
Do you want him?
I wouldn't touch him with a barge pole.
He's been near you.
You're only jealous.
He'd take one look at you and run.
Who'd you think you are?
Miss World?
- I'm the best, so don't forget it.
- Oooooh!
- Look at that slut.
- Don't.
She's not worth it.
She's a stuck-up bastard.
She won't be with my fist down her throat.
- You're a pair of dirty slags!
- Don't call me a slag, you bitch!
- Take your 'ands off me!
- What you going to do about it?
- Someone'll get the teacher.
- Go on.
See if I'm bothered.
You can't do it now!
Can't I?
How do you like that, then?
- Sir!
- Call me a slag if you dare.
- Slag!
- What?
- Susan's just hit me.
- What for?
I told her I know she's bothering with a married man.
Is this true?
Take no notice, sir.
She's dreaming.
She called me a slag so I hit her.
Get back to the coach.
I'm sick of this.
- Come on, girls, it's a disgrace.
- Come on, back to the coach.
Call this a day out?
You've wrecked it.
Get a move on!
Come on!
Come on, girls, get a move on!
Get a move on, girls, come on!
Never mind talking.
Move yourselves down.
I hope my mum doesn't find out I'm off school.
- She'll keep me in all week.
- She won't.
Hurry up.
I've never seen you move so quick.
Are you that desperate for a jump?
- I could be.
- I could shag the arse off him too.
I bet you could!
Right, last one over the Wall's an ugly cow!
Whoo!
- Come on, Rita.
- That's not fair!
You had a better start.
Come on, Rita, we're over here!
Boo!
Why do you two always leave me behind?
- We don't mean to, do we, Sue?
- Course not.
She's knows that.
- Ooh, what's that on your shoe?
- It's cow shit!
Oh, where the bleeding hell did that come from?
- It didn't fall out of sky.
- Ohhh!
- Wipe your shoe on the grass.
- Dirty pissing cow.
- Watch where you walk.
- Cows shouldn't shit everywhere.
What do you expect them to do?
Go in one corner of the field?
Or shall I ask the farmer to install a toilet and train 'em to shit in it?
I wish they bleedin' would.
God, it don't half pong.
Here, Sue!
- Oh, piss off, Rita.
- Bob!
I don't want to smell it, thanks.
- He don't want to smell it, thanks.
- Well, I don't!
Anyway, you might have sweaty feet.
You cheeky bleeder!
I had a bath last night, I'll have you know!
You'll be needing another one when you get home with t'cow shit here.
I hope I don't get any on me and Michelle sees it.
Oh, look, there's a fresh dollop of shit.
Look at all t'flies on it.
Next time, you know, they'll be in your house.
Walking all over your tea.
Give over, Rita.
- Bob?
- What?
Are we gonna... well, you know?
What's "Well, you know?"
What's she means is, are we going to have a jump?
- Why?
- That's what we're here for, innit?
- Oh, it is, it is, yeah.
- I'm going first.
- Why can't I?
- Because you can't.
I always have to go second!
What difference does it make?
You get the same thing.
- That's not fair.
I wanna go first.
- Why?
Because when I go second, it's not so good.
You're knackered.
- Why can't Sue go second?
- Will you go second, Sue?
If it'll stop her complaining, I suppose I'll have to.
- Why should you always get the best?
- There's no need to argue.
- I only wanna go first for a change.
- Nobody's stoppin' you.
One of you stop outside t'car.
I'm sick of getting squashed.
Let Rita go first.
I'll wait outside t'car.
You randy little basket.
- Reet.
- Ohh.
on.
I hope you're not going to be all day.
I can't do it like this.
I'm too squashed.
Can you take the weight off me legs?
They're killing me.
- What you doing?
- Trying to get comfortable.
I can't hear a word you're saying!
I said I'm trying to get comfortable.
Oh.
What's the matter, Bob?
I can't get an 'ard-on.
- Course you can.
- I'm telling you I can't.
Why not?
It don't seem to want to.
- Does that mean I can't have a jump?
- Looks that way.
- What's going on in there?
- He can't get an 'ard-on!
It's not bloody funny!
- I find this rather embarrassing.
- Never mind.
At least you tried.
For the first time I get to go first and you can't get an 'ard-on.
- I'm sorry.
- Never mind.
Get dressed.
I want to go home.
- Better luck next time, Reet.
- Shut your face, you!
- I'm glad I didn't go first now.
- I'm sorry.
I really am.
I feel so embarrassed.
I wouldn't let it worry you.
Poor Rita.
Will you get lost, you?
It's not bleeding funny!
You wouldn't like it if it happened to you!
It didn't, did it?
You should've let me go first.
We'd have been OK then.
- Piss off.
- Poor little Rita.
- Bob, tell her.
- Give over now.
It's not funny.
- I know it's not.
- Don't joke about it then!
I'm sorry.
I don't know why it is.

Hi, Bob!
Enjoying yourself, are you?
More!
More!
More!
Don't go talking to people.
Mum'll be here in a minute.
- It's OK.
I know him.
- What you doing here?
Well, I'm not waiting for you.
We'll take you for a ride round.
- Go on...
- You're out of luck.
- What's up with you?
- Everything.
I'm taking you two straight home.
Michelle's mate were in there.
Fat fucking Mavis.
She has got a right mouth on her.
Yoo-hoo!
- Hello, Mavis.
- Can I have a word with you?
Yes, come in.
Will you fucking let go?
Open the back door, would you, Mavis?
- Where the hell are we going?
- To see that slut, Sue.
And where the fuck are the kids?
With your mother.
Where do you think?
- What's going on here?
- That's Rita.
What are they doing here?
What the fuck have you been up to?
- Pinching husbands!
- You dirty little bastard.
- What have you said?
- Nowt!
That's what you get for mixing with sluts like her.
You tell her!
Go on, Sue!
- Give over shouting, you!
- I want you.
- What a fucking daughter you've got.
- What about your dirty husband?
What the fuck's been...
You with these two?
- I haven't been doin' fuck all.
- My husband is not a dirty bastard.
It's your daughter and her mate.
Are you satisfied now?
Stop blaming me.
It's as much your fault as it is mine.
- It's all you's fault.
- It's your husband.
It's your daughter.
If it's put there on a plate, he's going to take it.
He wouldn't be much of a man if he did owt else.
All of you's to blame.
I want to find out what's been going on!
Go on, Kevin, you tell them!
Ha-ha!
Up the IRA!
Don't you stick your oar in.
I'll flatten you, you bastard!
You tell him, man, you tell him!
It's your fault!
If you had sex with him, he wouldn't go elsewhere.
- Keep your mouth shut!
- Well...
Is that what you've been saying, you dirty bastard?
See what you've tried to cause.
Now you've done it.
- Get fucked, will you?
- Fuck you and your mate.
21 Manningham Lane!
- It's the best place for 'em!
- It's the best place for you!
- Will you let me go?
- Can't stand trouble you've caused?
Me and Sue's caused.
No, that's why I'm going.
You're not.
I 'aven't finished wi' you yet, you slut.
Let her fucking go.
Better than Match Of The Day, this.
Well?
Well?
Come on, Rita!
Get on.
Mavis, we're going home.
You dirty, mucky, filthy, lying, fucking bastard of a husband!
I hate you.
Is that the lot?
You won't get much more in there.
That'll do for now.
Michelle?
Michelle!
You bitch!
- Reet!
- Oh, hiya, come in!
Oh, get ready.
We're going to be late.
Oh, fuck school.
I'm not going any more.
- Why not?
- Because I'm not.
Oh, and don't start getting on at me.
I had enough yesterday.
We've only got two weeks and then we leave.
Well, I'm leaving two weeks early.
Anyway, I've got summat to tell you about Bob.
What?
In't he meeting us no more?
- I'm moving in with him.
- You're what?
- He asked me and I said yeah.
- The dirty bastard!
He wants me to go today.
Well, of all the dirty tricks.
- I never thought he'd do this.
- I never thought he'd ask me.
You maybe, but me?
I can hardly believe it.
- And are you going?
- Course I am.
- You dirty cow.
- Why am I?
- Just leaving me like that.
- He asked me.
Anyway, what's your mum have to say about this?
Only the usual crap.
I'm too young.
It won't last.
All that stuff.
I thought she might have stopped it.
Well, it's a bit late now, Sue.
I'm pregnant.
Don't talk bleeding daft.
How can you be?
He always used johnnies.
Oh, no, he didn't.
I used to meet him, many a time, and never told you.
- Didn't he tell you that?
- No, he fucking didn't, the sly bastard!
Do what you want!
I'm not bothered!
Don't be like that, Sue.
We can still be friends.
No point.
You'll only be accusing me of getting off wi' him.
Don't be silly.
How would you feel if it were the other way round?
Bet you wouldn't be chuffed, would you?
No, you're right.
I wouldn't.
I'm sorry, Sue.
Jesus, it's Bob.
I'm not even dressed.
You better hurry up then.
Huh.
You don't want him to see you like that.
Why not?
From now on, he'll see me like this every morning.
- Has she told you, then?
- Yeah, why?
- Well, aren't you bothered?
- Should I be?
- I thought you would've been.
- Course I'm fucking bothered.
That's my best mate you're going off with.
Well, you can still see her.
And me... if you'll still meet me.
No, thanks.
I won't be meeting you no more.
- Why not?
- I'm not doing the dirty on Rita.
And I don't think you should.
- Well, it's ta-Ra, then.
- Never mind the ta-ras, get gone.
- See you, Sue.
- Yeah, sure.
See ya, Reet.
Wish ya all the luck in the world.
What they saying, Aslam?
He's just telling her how much he loves her.
Why can't it have subtitles?
Because it's a Pakistani cinema.
What's she doing that for?
As soon as she stops, they kill her boyfriend.
- Does she stop?
- Don't talk while film's showing.
- Does she?
- I don't know.
- Would you do that for me?
- Would I hell.
Shh!
Sue?
Will you be me girlfriend?
I don't know yet.
We'll think about it.
I like you a lot.
That's nice.
- Will you, then?
- We'll see.
There's plenty of time to think about it.
I won't bother you that much.
I've never been out with a Paki before.
Then again, I don't suppose you'd be different from any other man.
Can I, er, put my arm round you?
- What for?
- I just want to.
That's all.
Well, go on, then.
If you want to.
You don't mind, do you?
Not really.
How about a...
lay down now?
Can do.
Can I kiss you?
Why do ya keep asking me if you can do this or do that?
- Just do it if you must.
- Thanks.
I don't mean you can strip me naked or anything like that.
Get out!
Go on!
Get out!
Get out!
Bloody mutt.
'...and the fight is all about man's best friend.
'This danger to our children's health is a threat.
'We've asked the council to do something, 'we go to endless meetings, nothing has been done.'
Watch me ornaments.
They're all right.
You'll not get a bleeding job sitting on your arse in here.
Listen who's talking.
You haven't done a day's work in years.
There's no way I'm workin' all week for £27.30 on some bleedin' training' scheme.
You should be thankful for it.
Give over.
Even I wouldn't work for that.
I used to work for 18 shillings.
That were in t'days of Methuselah.
Money were worth more then.
You get nowt for 27.30 nowadays.
Yes, I must say, I agree with Sue.
You keep out of this, you black bastard.
- There's no need for that.
- Get out!
Go on!
Get out!
And don't come back!
Else I'll smash them fucking black brains out your black head!
- I can't help being a Paki.
- Yes, you fucking can.
- You shouldn't interfere.
- Nor should you.
You always tell folk what they should do and you haven't done it yourself.
I've done some things.
You've done nowt and you've been nowt all your life.
Anyhow...
I'm going to have a lie down.
And when I get up, I want them two out of it.
Oh, go to bed!
Fucking going.
Come on, Aslam.
We're going.
He won't remember what he said when he gets up.
I don't care.
I'm not stopping around to listen to him every time he's been out drinking.
If you want, we can go to me sister's.
At least we'll be welcome there.
You like Pakistan?
You go with Aslam?
Yes?
I don't know.
I've never been abroad.
Nice place.
Nice people.
See Aslam mum.
I don't like flying.
Nice, not hurt.
I don't know.
I might go some day.
OK, think.
Why won't you come to Pakistan?
Cos I've read it in t'paper, about Paki fellas taking their women and children over and fucking leaving them.
- Don't be silly.
- I 'ave!
You'd probably sell me to some old Paki who couldn't walk.
I wouldn't sell you.
Nobody" 'ave you.
Well, you'll never get me there anyway, will you?
- So, what you doing now then?
- I'm living with a lad, Aslam.
- Who?
- A Paki?
- We live at his sister's.
- Do you like it?
Not really.
It's not the place.
It's his sister I can't stand.
She won't let us sleep together.
- When you coming out?
- Tomorrow, I hope.
- Sorry you lost the baby, Reet.
- It's all right.
Course it is.
We'll be able to have others.
Oh, have you 'eard it?
I know.
He'd love it for me to be banged up all t'time.
Yeah, think about all t'family allowance we'd get.
Fuck the family allowance.
It's not you that'd look after 'em.
You tell him, Reet.
I've missed you, you know.
I bet you have.
I'm not taking you straight home.
- I'm taking you up on t'moors.
- You are not!
Come on, don't be so rotten.
I'm dying for a jump.
That's your problem.
Not mine.
I like you.
A lot.
Don't talk rubbish.
Just take me home.
Whoo!
Go on!
You thought I didn't see you, didn't you?
See what?
You've been with that fella, haven't you?
You haven't been to the hospital.
It were just an excuse!
That was Rita's fella.
He was giving me a lift home from t'hospital.
I bet he was.
Ask Rita when you see her if you don't believe me.
- I will.
- Ow!
Don't let me see you with another fella or I'll break your neck.
Fucking hell.

In 1944 I was 12 years.
and I felt ugly, what I was between the majority.
Although my nose had not reached maturity, and was on track.
and as all the "four eyes" "Carrot head"
"Dwarf", "chubby" "Chubby midget" and "big nose"
had only one ambition:
find a tactic to seduce the prettiest girl in the world.

OUR FATHER LAWS AND GRANDFATHER.
Do not stay there, children.
Take cover!
You too, Alfred!
Do not stand there!
Hurry!
Be safer on the porch.
Mom!
- Never!
Emile never leave to a gunfight.
Mom, is ridiculous:
are bombing us.
You do what you want.
He never recede before the enemy.
What enemies!
We are bombarding the British.
Well, I agree to retire, but not as Capitulants SOME people I know.
Hurry!
Alfred, can not you leave your horse out?
And how do you want me buried if he dies?
I've always said he prefers Christians animals.
You're right.
Brothers, we pray:
Our Father ...
Do you fear for your home?
Sure.
I hope this time finally give that damn bridge.
Oh, my foot!
Where is your shoe?
Answers to your mother.
I think I've lost.
And they were the last ones you were made of leather.
You will now have to wear clogs.
I do not care!
Do not be cool!
Sing, brothers!
Thank God!
I was so scared!
What did he say?
Just ask Pierre-Marie.
Have damaged the lower the city, as always.
Are you okay, Raymond?
Pierre-Marie!
But how did you happen?
And all for a shoe!
This time also did not have given the bridge.
What horror!
Not have given the bridge but the hearse.
They have killed a second time.
At least the second time not be sustained.
My deepest condolences, ma'am.
I also have lost everything.
I have only him.
Goodbye.
My condolences, ma'am.
I will pray for you.
Jocelyne, I found your shoe.
Thank you.
Thanks, Pierre-Marie.
Tomorrow will have a cardinal.
Raise the nose.
Grandma, do you think now stop growing?
It is not so great.
Nose beautiful, weeny big.
Nature is wise.
At least you who has inherited the nose and not your sister.
What do you mean?
Nothing, nothing.
That for a girl is ugly.
Thank you very much, Louise.
I was not referring to you, Marguerite.
I hope, because with regard to that Madeleine is well endowed.
- Gifted?
- Ivette!
I'll go.
When I think how nice it would have been the funeral in St. Malo ...
If bubiese died a little earlier ...
We are all refugees in this hotel.
The important thing in life is to arrive on time.
There, young man.
Let me see.
This is your grandfather in the war of 14.
How handsome he was.
You were lucky that marry you.
You do not say, Pierre-Marie.
Why?
I know me not going to marry anyone.
What a fool!
"Good morning.
"Good morning, dear.
This is from my mother.
To thank what of my shoe.
An egg!
And it's cool.
Do not break.
Say thank you, do not stay stands as a stud.
Oh!
A stud.
"Thanks.
"Nothing.
Take the box.
You can use.
Goodbye, ladies.
What gallantry?
Join Jocelyne.
This guy will end up with manners farmer if I have no care.
My mother says you're a nice guy.
It's true.
I hope to meet with guys like you in Combourg.
- In Combourg?
"Yes.
Dad sends us home my aunt.
It is by the bridge.
We are too close.
It has been dropped another piece of our roof.
So you do not see you again?
Wait, I can see you tomorrow?
No, I have to help my mother to pack.
"Oh, are you?
"I was expecting.
Climb.
Until then, big nose.
You've been screwed, eh?
Shit, pretty girls like the pretty boys.
In the ugly, too.
There is little left for us.
At least you have good plant.
Do not complain.
In that or fixed.
Have you seen Paolo ... and your bike?
You still would find an ugly, at least.
Of that, nothing.
You know what this means?
Well, see you later.
Is luckier than her sister.
A funeral, a barrage ...
It is too much for her.
You, too, Mado.
Take it calmly, not look well.
Get changed, you're going to get dirty.
- Is it contagious, doctor?
- Jaundice?
No.
Not for Madeleine, or the baby.
I will start testing Fidelioanddid not want...
I told you there is no danger.
My friend.
Adios, Mado.
Back tomorrow.
You do not think spending quarantine in the basement.
Kidding, honey.
Do not touch me, you catch.
Hamon House FINE LINGERIE
Threemonthsof bloodycombat.
The British 8th Army, supported by the5thU.S.Army has succeeded in taking Monte Cassino.
Yvette, the window.
From the outside no sound.
Not that, it's my throat.
Mother, we are waiting.
"This is good news.
"Yes.
Before you get here.
Change station.
He's a menace.
They have spent months through a minefield.
When I think that my Emile spent whole nights clearing minefields with his bayonet, command of its 300 Senegalese.
Oh, my God!
I can still see her face black with soot.
In those days were really brave.
That's Wagnerian, Mom.
These elbows!
What Verdun?
Two years versus without moving an inch in front.
"And the night that took the famous cliff?
You were too young to remember.
He was wounded shoulder.
He had lost at least two thousand blacks.
But it took that damn cliff!
Yes, yes ...
But he lost the next morning.
I thought that was only 300 men.
Two thousand.
They died like flies.
It was hell, Louise.
Thousands dead for nothing.
Want mine?
I'm just saying that war is useless.
I can not hear anything with this noise.
What did you say?
I'm in my house Marguerite.
No need to repeat it constantly, dear.
I know that here we're just refugees.
Pierre-Marie, stands guard at the door.
Hurry, I can.
Go with your sister.
What's wrong?
Nothing, the child has moved.
Take care of your sister dammit!
And do not give such a hurry by all devils.
Do not go, I have fear.
I'm hoping that you're older.
I'm older.
Already a guy kissed me.
Shut up, I'm thinking.
Do not you want to know who?
I do not care.
Would you be long?
"Yes.
His name is Robert.
It was in Saint Malo, last year.
Do you kiss well, or so, that Roger?
So.
It proves that has kissed.
And not called Roger, but Robert.
Maybe you can not beat that nose, but he did.
Anyway, never kiss your Jocelyne.
- What about you, do you know?
"She's going in two days.
Not yet gone.
"I can go with you, Mama?
- What about school?
"It's Thursday.
Take the bike grandmother.
It is a girl bike.
I'll take Dad's.
Ask permission.
"Wait.
"Hurry.
"If I have not yet finished.
"It was so beautiful.
Really?
I think I've been mediocre at Augenblik .
"Not bad.
- Can you teach me to sing?
If we were in St. Malo, would go to my class.
If you really care, we will that when finished with Fidelio .
Really?
Formidable!
Tell me, would you mind borrow your bike?
Ah, that was why ...
No way!
Take the grandmother.
It has a flat tire.
Mine do not lend it.
Now, let me work.
Jo.
I'll tell my mom I do not want help.
A scratch and I pull out skin to strip, okay?
Thanks, Dad.
Do not waste time and hurry.
Do you think the bridge is solid?
It is made with the best granite.
Could destroy a bomb?
Why ask?
As long ago that you are bombing ...
It must be hard to hit.
So they have to go Jocelyne's parents.
So just giving up?
With a well-placed bomb be achieved.
Well, let's go from here.
- Jean-Marie!
- Yes, Mom?
Wait a bit.
It is increasingly difficult.
- I Want to carry the suitcase?
-No.
"We stopped for five minutes?
The baby weighs each day.
How did the baby there?
It's the magic of love.
Is that what you mean fuck?
I forbid you to use the word.
It's rude.
Tell me ...
Dad and you do you want?
Of course, son.
Why do you ask?
I do not know ...
Do not you kiss.
Do not call to see us.
These things are not done in public.
It hurts to go Jocelyne, Right?
Not yet gone.
Look lady, six napkins and a tablecloth.
Pure cotton.
You can wash without shrinking.
We do not need those things on a farm.
Look at them.
They are precious.
Would be nice to use the Sundays.
Or in a communion.
We could ...
We have no means.
A pair of silk stockings?
For me?
No.
Try La Posada of Happiness .
They rub shoulders with pájaras Germans do not lack anything.
- Gaston Truth?
"Well.
Too bad.
Wait.
Among French we must help.
- How much do you want?
"Not much.
Two dozen eggs, a pound of manqtequilla, five kilos of potatoes and a pound of bacon.
"Half a pound.
"Okay.
The means, too.
And what's your wonderful idea?
Speak up:
nobody here.
I know how to prevent Jocelyne that go.
Yes?
How?
Are you able to save a secret?
"Yes.
"A secret truth.
"I'm your friend, right?
- Even if you tortured?
Depends.
Come, I show something.
- Will you speak?
I can not.
- What now?
- Still do not know anything!
You're an idiot!
Shit!
It was just to know whether endure.
"You swear you will not say anything to anyone?
Not even your old?
Yes, shit, I swear!
Spit.
Are you already happy?
It is the bridge so they are bombing his home, right?
Yes.
If the bridge was destroyed would stop bombing and
Jocelyne would no longer to go.
Yes.
Well you know what we must do.
There are only blow up the bridge.
You're kidding, right?
You're completely crazy.
Completely crazy!
It's crazy!
It's crazy!
Wait until you see mom out here.
It is unbearable!
Come, Fredo.
My grandmother gave me the idea.
Your grandmother has pumps?
"No, we will use a mine.
- A mine?
Yes, there in the field, under the bridge.
Do not worry, Fredo, I know what to do.
If you know, do not need me.
It is best done by two.
"Conspiring, eh?
More than one girl ears are buzzing.
This is impossible to have a minute's peace.
Come, Fredo.
We're going.
And drink up as men.
So, do you agree?
Well, you do it by Jocelyne, but what about me?
Have I not hard to understand ...
If we fly bridge do not call again "Big nose" or "chubby."
We will be heroes.
Fuck you the girls you want.
"Even with Jeanne?
You'll have to hide to leave you in peace.
But what if we die?
We must not get caught.
Well?
"Well, okay.
"Swear.
- Again?
"I've said I swear.
I swear you blow up the bridge and if not I die and go to hell.
Are not you ashamed?
The church is not spitting.
How hard you are!
What a plague!
"Have no fear, I am.
- What are you doing?
No I tell you, you always goats.
Well, I call Mom.
I'll get mine.
Why?
To blow up the bridge.
"I want you.
-No.
Never take me anywhere.
It is very dangerous.
Even We can die for France.
Why I can not I die for France?
You're too small and you also have jaundice.
I can never do anything.
If you want to help, lie down and shut up.
I do not want help, I go with you.
Look, if I die, I give all my toys.
The soldiers, animals, everything.
How far the slingshot?
Provided you go to bed.
So, okay.
So long.
I told you is full of Germans.
Only four.
And the bridge is enormous.
At night it looks bigger.
About everything.
Are you sure?
Look, forget it.
I'm going home.
If you go, scream.
You're an idiot.
- See that tree?
"Yes.
Will post mine there.
From there you can not see us.
I'm out.
You can not beat it before starting.
"Choose.
- What for? "
To decide who will to put the mine.
I'm not going.
In addition, I do not know how.
It's easy.
Stuck in the ground.
When you bump into something hard ...
It is a mine.
And then take it out carefully.
Fredo!
Let me, I want to go home.
I'll break the sock.
Quick two men right.
Pierre-Marie, do not want to die.
Raise your hands and not kill us.
Pierre-Marie, I did.
- What?
"I've screwed up.
areupthere.
twochildren.
What a scare they gave me.
-What?
"There are two children.
Givethemakickintheass and throw them.
I told you it would not work, asshole.
Go heroes, huh?
It's your fault, just wanted to escape.
I'm full of shit, all for having ignored.
My father made me cry and spank me again.
I have another idea.
Do not tell me I long.
Gallina.
Pichablanda.
Cagamierda.
-Nose.
-Barrel of tallow.
That son of a bitch already.
There has been alarm.
Have you heard planes?
-No.
- And that chair?
- What?
"I do not know, Ivette.
"Put something.
- Are not you cold?
- What?
"A very strange noise.
There have been awakened.
"And now what?
I do not know.
- What are you doing here?
"Nothing, Dad.
-Account.
"Nothing, why?
What you give me if I dont talk?
If you speak, say Robert kissed you.
So what?
Not true.
But if you're sleeping like an angel.
- Incredible!
- What?
- What have you done?
"I was asleep.
Senegalese Disguised!
Why blow up the bridge?
"It's not true.
"Yes it is, a liar.
Sincere as his grandfather.
Mozart wanted a and have a Bonaparte.
They are kid things.
Could not blow up the bridge.
Where were you during the explosion?
"In the lobby.
"Liar.
Ivette was in the kitchen.
You see I was home.
But someone has blown up the bridge.
- Do you have flown?
"Exactly.
And you've discussed your plan with everyone.
If the Germans hear, will believe it was you.
And you.
What can we do?
Nothing.
Hopefully soon caught the real saboteurs.
What a way to see it.
Last week, at least shot ten men.
How?
Since the accident had not supports the slightest shock.
Have you looked at naked Ivette in the kitchen!
At the porch!
Germans are coming.
Corre, forget the books.
Why do you stand?
Hide-Pierre-Marie.
"From the German.
What the hell you are!
Thanks to you, Jocelyne no longer has to go.
It's true.
You're a great guy, you know?
"Tell us in the playground.
"See you at noon.
They stopped the British who blew up the bridge.
And they're going to shoot this morning.
Of shit.
"Hero of cheesy.
"I never said that he should make me.
Neither has denied.
Stop fighting.
Enough is enough.
Hey big nose, save your back.
Everyone inside.
Jewish pig!
Pierre-Marie, what are you doing there?
If you saw your mother ...
If your parents hear you're playing truant 're going to make soup.
What goes on inside that head?
Just like your grandfather ...
Stubborn as a mule.
Instead of making silly, come with me to the grave
Distract you.
Clean your grandfather minefields in 14 does not mean you have to.
To be honest, it was his black.

A Jew is someone it's not like us.
Why?
Well, blacks are not as us, but you can tell at a glance.

So, what is recognize them?
For your nose, maybe.
What happens to your nose?
It is long and hooked.
And because they are rich and do nothing.
How is it possible?
Nobody knows.

"Thank you, ma'am.
These ladies are very generous.
Vulgar, but generous.
With the money from the Germans.

The prisoners do not want Money collaborator.
How?
Do not you like money?
This is the house of the Lord.
Collect your money.
Do not make a scene, please.
You do not like letting go your money.
This bill stinks.

Do you hear what I say?
My wife is right:

Still you are there?
So, your mother wants recover their stockings?
My brother has squealed.
Have you heard, Blanche?
Fredo wants you back stockings.
Come by them.
Come on, outside.
Why are you so quiet?
Wait, that damn farm is so far away.
I have to go back or I will collect.
What if the farmer no longer has the means?
If it does not, never coming home.
You're crazy.
Spank you, and you're done.
There!
German is the bike.
Entered in all bars instead of going to Saint Malo.

"Because I lost.
We will go to buy other Robillard.
Mom, I lied.
Pierre-Marie, say it is not true.
That seemed.
A little big, right?
Or take it or leave it, That's all we have.
What a shame.
What happens here?
Bonaparte has been doing barter with the girls
TheInnof Happiness.
The earrings, stockings silk.
That was it.
Your father would kill you.
This is too much.
Why do not you tell me?
Should paid by those damn earrings.
"I'll talk with those pájaras.
"We're not ashamed.
In your state or talk.
I'm your mother and I forbid you to go.
And those, probably already have broken the half.
Go to your room and do not move from there!
It is incorrigible.
Excuse me, what do I do now?
Come back when you have the biggest tits.
What impudence!
I will not tread this store.
Still not gone?
Did you sleep well?
Luisa, I understand that this is not my home but hide the potty is a bit strong.
When I went back to bed I could not sleep.
I would never do that.

Last night there were more than half loaf.
I wrapped myself.
The bacon is gone and I do not like.
Not me.
Have you seen the soap?
Everything disappears in this house.
It is always my fault.
And this time, what have you done?
And we'll have to wait another child.
All of my misspent youth by pulp ...
To mourn for your mother!
You, to school.
're Sick or not.
And if you go, be careful.
And acábate that.
Was it you?

Mother, take your shawl.
Madeleine, your scarf.
Everyone below.
It may not be for us.
Why, down?
Loss could drop a bomb .. y.
In the basement, no.
I have to do homework.
Better a live donkey a dead genius.
Do not make me angry, I said below.
This really is a novelty you want to do homework.
Yvette, the basement!
I can not pass.
Watch your head, Madeleine.
Pierre-Marie, come.
And this, what are you doing here?
Say something.
Talk.
One second.

"I'm scared.
Do not be afraid, honey.
Want a drink?
I do not speak French.
And that these wild been here four years.
Not for us.
Alert over, planes away.
No more, dear.
Do not be afraid.
You can go.
"I thought you were talking German.
CANTO I German.
So 20 years ago do not know what you sing.
What matters is the accent.
I, prisoner.
What does that mean?
No, you are free.
I, prisoner.
He's crazy.
Tell the commander is crazy in our basement.
Mother is right.
Try to distract him while I go.
Do not go, Dad.
It is crazy, is my prisoner.
Look at me.
A is not true.
It is impossible.
Look at your child.
Yes, indeed.
But it's not my fault.
Tell the truth.
Please do not start to use their methods.
Yvette, up to Thérèse.
I demand the truth.
I, a prisoner of him.
I'm waiting.
Ivette, do not go:
I have fear.
Me, too.
What can we do?
Giving to the deserter own.
They know how to punish him.
Can you imagine Jean-Charles diciçendoles to SS:
"I have a deserter in my basement to three days I have been feeding?
And he will say contrary, naturally.
It's a plot to I run.
Aunt Melissa's farm is very isolated.
And he would love such a gift.
We could all go there.
And the other stay here while.
And if you scream and reach their peers hide his machine gun and say that we captured.
And we shoot them all.
We are trapped.
And all because of your son.
Now I can forget Fidelio .
Two years of preparations.
Even my wardrobe is prepared.
"Not entirely.
"Okay.
Fate is cruel.
"That's not very nice.
"What a pity.
Contact Resistance.
Brilliant idea!
They get us out of it.
Fucking great!
Do you know where to hide maybe?
What?
He hurt his side.
Or your back or stomach.
Want suckers.
They are in the closet.
My jars of jam.
I will not hold your manners much longer.
Oh, no?
I'm dying of laughter.
Bar will be better than everything.
This radio is mine and will stay there.
But he wants.
German pork.
A white wine, please.
A foul weather, right?
Could be worse.
Have one with me.
Yes, thanks.
"Lord, too?
Salud!
Could you do me a favor?
Depends.
I want to contact with the Resistance.
"With the FFI or the FTP?
What you suggest?
It depends on what you want.
Anyway, I could not tell.
You can not run a business and blow up trains.
- What do you want?
"Look for the Resistance.
Why?
Do you think singers need?
You will find them easily:
go to the forest and sing "Uh, uh ..., Resistance."
Not for me.
Good, because here there of those.
My brother has spent fifteen days looking for them.
He has more luck.
Drop bombs is fine, but who pay the price?
We, of course.
We are not pro-German but certainly should remain calm.
They will end up killing many of us as Germans.
Go Heroes!
And you, Roger, what do you think?
It has its pros and cons.
I do not interfere.
It is Norman.
Thanks anyway.
I count on your discretion.
What?
Got a light?
Do not smoke.
It's bad for the throat.
No matter, I have no cigarettes.
Looking for the Resistance?
Do not listen to these charlatans.
I know where to find the Resistance.
Go see Mr. Guivard.
On my part.
Does the policeman?
- Who are you?
"Roger Gonnet.
Why look for the Resistance Mr Tézé?
I have a friend
an acquaintance that something strange has happened.
An unfortunate adventure.
I had thought that you may help.
And as I do, thought ...
You were right.
It has a stowaway in the basement.
- Who knows?
"Nobody.
How long that houses?
Three days.
Is your friend here?
Lately they have not demolished no plane around.
How did you come home Your friend?
"Precisely.
"Never mind.
You have given with the right person.
We will take Broualan.
They need instructors.
Is it English or American?
The problem is that is not one of the two.
It is a German.
"German?
It is German, is armed and friend lives on Main Street.
And what does making the resistance?
If attacked, the Germans retaliation.
"That's what I said.
"Three days ago, eh?
HansHermann, disappearedbetweenRennesand Saint Bad Sunday night ...
If the Germans find out that is here, will be a disaster.
What advice would you ...
my friend?
Hide until the storm passes.
Are not you serious?
Good luck, Mr. Tézé.
If I hear anything, of course inform "his friend."
It's a bad job.
It's a bad job.
We can not get rid of that gross until the end of the war.
And all thanks to your son.
It is unfair.
How many families French can boast to take a prisoner German in the basement?
No responsibility is yours, Mother.
What happens now?
Want a corkscrew.
Yes, right?
We feed, but this really is not.
Do not drink the good wine.
Could you tell?
Wait.
It is capable of breaking my best bottles.

But while ...

Will you rub my back as before?
Do you, I'm tired.
Mom, talk to me, please.
I will not.
And do not call me mom.
I'm sick of you.

It's not my fault.
So who is, mine?
No, Jocelyne.
I do not want.
You, either.
Nobody loves me.
What are you saying?
Only, Fredo.
My small.
Why continue this?
It makes no sense.
What?
Hello, where have you been?
So what is in your basement?
I heard your father talking with mine.

"Better.
"Much better, thank you.
Go and do business.
I was doing a dictation.
Are you good at spelling?
"How nice.

It is my father's wardrobe.
Fredo gave me your letter.
You are very kind, but I've already explained ...
But if the next day gave me a kiss.
In appreciation.
It is not the same.
It is, of chocolate, right?
It does not matter.
Anyway, I had not believed.

I hope so, ma'am.
Excuse me.
Suplíqueme forgiveness.
I beg you to forgive me.
What?

I can not congratulate him.
He will tell you what you have done.
"No, young man?
I spat on his hat.
Are you aware of the penalties that may be worth?
We'll make.
Silk stockings for the officer.
Think you can buy the honor a German officer with silk?
He must be mad.
"No, I just ...
In the basement, hurry!
But if the basement is flooded.
Sorry sir, but not we can offer shelter.
I did not ask anything, ma'am.
Protect yourself from you his American friends.

Wait.

Want a ride on my bike?
I do not understand why do all this.
But it seems a bit my fault.
I have not had enough time for you.
Already almost a man,

I promise I will not do more nonsense, Mom.
These times are hard for everyone, but after the war will make a long journey.

Americans are in Normandy
On June 6, 1944, Americans landed in Normandy and were to put an end to all my concerns.
Americans!
They're coming.
Goodbye, Fidelio !
They have waited four years;
few weeks, so what?
And goodbye to the tenant.

"Your prisoner.
This is for you.
Where were you a month ago?
We have done what we could, ma'am.

"I'm not that geeky names.
If you want to know something, ask me.
Like when we did prisoner ...
I said
"Take him the machine gun." German I was scared to death.
This is my cousin Laurence, Avranches.
Pierre-Marie, I tell you something.
Wait a minute.
Would you like chocolate?
"Chewing gum?
What I like are oranges.
Are the oranges?
I can get all you want.
Hey, Fredo?
In May 1944, I was 12 years old.
I was classified as ugly, by far the largest category.
My nose had not yet attained maturity, but it already showed promise.
And like all the cross-eyed, the flaming redheads, the short, the fat, the stubby and other big-noses, my only concern was...
How, by what strategy, could I seduce the one who was for me the most beautiful girl in the world?
I promise...
I swear!
To our captain. 3rd regiment Infantry of Senegal.
To my husband, a hero who fell for his country.
To our father, father and grandfather of distressed children.
Don't stand there, kids.
Get in the shelter.
Alfred, you too.
Really, don't stand there.
Come on.
To be safer we should go to the porch.
Mom!
Never!
I'm not leaving Émile to the pellets.
Mom, you can't stay under the bombs.
You go.
He never recoiled from the enemy.
What enemy?
These are the English.
Okay.
I retreat but I'm not surrendering.
- Not like some...
- Let's go.
Mamadou, let's go.
Mamadou!
My God, couldn't you leave your nag outside?
How can I bury you if he dies?
He prefers his animals over Christians.
Calm down my brothers and pray.
Our Father, who art in Heaven Hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
(Mamadou prays in Arabic)
And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Deliver us from evil.
Amen.
- Afraid for your house?
- Yes
I hope the damned bridge gets hit this time.
Ouch, my foot.
Where's your shoe?
Answer.
Where's your shoe?
- I lost it.
- Your last leather pair.
She'll wear sandals then.
- What do I care.
- Don't be insolent!
Let us sing, my brothers.
Thank you, God!
What is she saying?
I don't know.
Only Pierre-Marie can understand her.
Pierre-Marie?
- Have you seen him?
- No.
Pierre-Marie!
Pierre-Marie!
Pierre-Marie!
Pierre-Marie!
Are you okay?
- Pierre-Marie.
- He's bleeding.
- What was he thinking?
- Are you hurt?
- And that for a shoe.
- They missed the bridge again.
How awful!
They missed the bridge, but didn't miss the hearse.
They killed him again.
He's been murdered twice.
Poor Marguerite.
He didn't suffer the second time, at least.
Sincere condolences, Madam.
I lost everything, too.
He's all I have left.
I'm no longer needed.
My condolences.
I will pray for you.
Jocelyne, I found your shoe.
Thank you, dear Pierre-Marie.
- Poor Marguerite.
- It's horrible.
What a story.
Does this hurt?
It will get blue.
Keep your nose up.
Will this prevent it from growing big?
It's not that big.
A big nose means a strong willy.
- Yvette!
- It's true.
Nature knows best.
Better you and not your sister.
Poor girl.
What do you mean, Louise?
- Nothing...
It's awkward for a girl.
- Thank you, Louise.
How nice!
- I'm not talking about you.
- I hope so.
In that respect, Madeleine is well provided for.
What, "well provided"?
Really, Yvette!
I'll get it.
We could've had a beautiful funeral in Saint-Malo.
If only Émile had died sooner.
Marguerite!
Before coming to this god-forsaken hole.
God-forsaken hole?
That's life!
Nobody chooses when to die.
Okay, go ahead little man.
Let me see.
This is your grandfather during the war of 1914.
Oh, he was handsome.
You were lucky he married you.
Pierre-Marie!
Don't say those things!
Why?
Nobody will want to marry me.
- You're being silly.
- I'm not.
- Hello, ladies.
- Hello, darling.
Hello, Pierre-Marie.
- It's from my mother.
- For me?
She wanted to thank you for my shoe.
Oh, what a beautiful egg!
- It's fresh.
You can eat it soft boiled.
- Don't break it.
Say thank you!
Don't stand there like an asparagus.
Oh, an asparagus...
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Take the box.
You can reuse it.
Thanks.
Goodbye, ladies.
Goodbye, Jocelyne.
Bye, Pierre-Marie.
Show some gallantry!
Walk Jocelyne out.
He'd behave like a hick, if I didn't keep an eye.
My mother says you're a nice guy.
It's true.
You're nice.
I hope I'll find boys like you in Combourg.
- Combourg?
- Yes.
Dad sends us to my aunt.
Because of the bridge.
We're too close.
Part of the roof fell down.
We won't see each other anymore.
Wait!
Can we meet tomorrow?
No, I have to help my mother with the trunks.
- Ah, it's you.
- I was waiting for you.
Sit down.
See ya, Big-Nose.
Bastard.
You got screwed again.
Disgusting.
Pretty girls only want pretty boys.
Ugly girls too.
You're right.
Nothing much left for us.
Look, you can't complain.
You're not bad... your body.
They don't care.
Have you seen Paulo's face?
- And his bike.
- Yeah.
So they say, but...
- Would you like to screw an ugly girl?
- Not really.
- You know what that means?
- Yes.
- Okay, see ya.
- See ya.
That rascal is doing better than his sister.
They have been through a lot.
So have you.
Take it easy now.
You don't look well.
Get changed before you get dirty.
- Is it contagious, doctor?
- Jaundice?
No.
No risk for Madeleine or the baby.
It's just that...
I'll be rehearsing Fidelio and...
I'm telling you that there is no risk.
- Dear friend.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Paul.
- Goodbye, Mado.
I'll come tomorrow.
Are you putting yourself in quarantine?
I was joking.
Don't touch me, you'll catch the disease.
After six months of fighting, the British army, backed by the Americans, just conquered the strategic town Monte Cassino.
Yvette, the window.
Nobody can hear us.
It's bad for my throat.
Mom, come to the table.
- A job well done.
- They will be here soon.
Change station, it could be dangerous.
So many months to get through a bloody minefield!
My Émile spent nights to clear mines... with a bayonet.
In charge of his 300 Senegalese.
Oh my God!
I won't forget his handsome face, black with soot.
- They had courage in those days.
- That's from Wagner, Mom.
Your elbows!
At Verdun, they stayed 2 years face to face not moving an inch.
And the night he captured the bloody peak?
You can't remember.
You were still small.
That night he was wounded in the shoulder, he lost at least 2000 Negroes, but he captured the damned peak.
Yes, but it was re-captured the next day.
I thought he had only 300 men?
Men died everywhere, Louise.
It was hell.
Thousands died for nothing.
Do you want mine?
War serves no purpose...
I can't hear with that noise.
What?
Well...
I'm in my house, Marguerite.
No need to repeat it again and again.
I know we are just refugees in your house.
Pierre-Marie, come and stand guard.
Pierre-Marie, it's urgent.
Pierre-Marie, go guard your sister.
- What's wrong, my darling?
What is it?
- Nothing.
The baby moved.
Pierre-Marie.
Pierre-Marie, go guard your sister!
Bloody hell!
Don't rush.
Drag your feet more!
Don't go away, huh?
I'm scared.
I hope you grow up soon.
I'm grown up.
Proof is, a boy kissed me.
Shut up.
I'm thinking.
- You want to know who?
- I don't care.
- Are you going to take long?
- Yes.
His name is Robert.
It was last year in Saint-Malo.
Did Roger kiss you like this, or like that?
Like that.
He never kissed you, then.
His name is not Roger, but Robert.
You can't kiss like that because of your nose.
- You won't be able to kiss Jocelyne.
- What do you know?
- She's leaving in two days.
- She hasn't left yet.
Mom!
- Can I come with you?
- What about school?
- It's Thursday.
- Then take granny's bike.
Not that's a girl's bike.
I prefer dad's.
- Go ask permission.
- Wait for me, huh.
- Hurry up.
- Wait for me.

- It was great.
- You think so?
- Yeah.
- The "Augenblick" was so-so.
- What?
You know, the... ♪Ha!
Welch' ein Augenblick
- It's not bad.
- It's much better.
Could you teach me to sing?
If we were in Saint-Malo, I'd take you in my class.
If you're still interested, we'll talk after Fidelio.
Really?
That would be wonderful.
- Say... could I borrow your bike?
- Ah, that was it!
- Out of the question!
- But, Dad...
- Take granny's.
- It has a flat.
You manage somehow, but you can't have my bike.
- Now let me work.
- Well, too bad...
I'll tell Mom you don't want me to help her with the food supplies.
I warn you.
Not a single scratch, or I skin you.
Thanks, Dad.
Come on Pierre-Marie, don't trail behind.
Do you think that bridge is sturdy?
Yes, it's granite from Lanhélin.
Do you think a bomb could break it?
Why do you ask?
Because they've been bombing it for so long.
It must be hard to hit from high above.
That's why Jocelyne's parents want to go.
But if they hit the bridge directly?
A well-planted bomb, surely.
Come on.
Warning, MINES.
- Pierre-Marie!
- Yes, Mom?
Wait a minute.
Oh my!
It's getting hard.
Shall I carry the bag?
No, no.
- We can stop for 5 minutes.
- No, no.
The baby is getting heavy.
How did the baby get there?
That's the magic of love.
- Is that "to screw"?
- I forbid you to say such things!
- It's bad manners.
- Ah.
Okay.
Say, do you and Dad love each other?
But of course, darling.
Why are you asking?
Dunno...
You never kiss each other.
We just don't call you whenever we want to kiss.
You don't do it in front of everybody.
You're sad that Jocelyne is leaving, eh?
- She's not gone yet.
- Ah, okay.
What about this?
Look at this.
It's a set.
Towels and tablecloth, all in cotton.
Wash them all you want, they won't fade.
We don't need ornaments on the farm.
Look at this.
Look.
It's nice to eat on a beautiful tablecloth on Sundays.
- Or for a communion.
- We could...
We can't afford it.
And a pair of stockings?
Real silk.
Not for me!
Perhaps for the chicks at the Inn of Happiness.
They flirt with the Krauts and have everything.
Right, Gaston?
Okay.
Never mind.
Wait.
Among French, we should help each other.
- How much do you want?
- Not much.
Two dozen eggs, a pound of butter,
5 kg of potatoes and a pound of bacon.
A half pound of bacon.
- Okay.
- And the stockings, too.
So, what's this big thing?
(Prevent Jocelyne from leaving.)
Speak up.
There's nobody here.
We'll prevent Jocelyne from leaving.
- But how?
- Can you keep a secret?
- Well, yeah.
- But a real secret.
Well, yeah.
I'm your buddy, right?
Even if they torture you?
Well...
It depends.
Come here.
I'll show you something.
So, you got something to say?
- Are you gonna talk?
- But you haven't even told me anything.
You're stupid!
Shit!
It was just a test.
Do you swear not to tell anyone?
- Not even your folks?
- Yes, I swear.
What the hell!
Spit.
There.
Are you happy now?
Bombs fall on Jocelyne's house because of the bridge.
Yes.
If the bridge were destroyed, the bombing would stop.
Yes.
Then Jocelyne won't have to go away.
Yes.
- That's what we have to do.
- Really?
We have to blow up the bridge.
You must be joking!
You're completely nuts.
But you're completely nuts!
He's nuts!
He's nuts!
If Mom sees you outside with your jaundice...
She is annoying.
Come, Frédo.
My grandmother gave me the idea.
Does she have bombs?
- No.
You use a mine.
- A mine?
There are mines in the field under the bridge.
Oh my!
I know how to do it.
Don't worry, Frédo.
If you know how, you don't need me.
Two are better than one.
Aha!
I smell conspiracy.
Some girls' ears must be burning now.
Can't have peace in this shack.
Come, Frédo.
We're out of here.
They even drink like men.
So you agree?
You're funny.
You're doing it for Jocelyne, but I...
You still don't get it...
If we blow up the bridge, goodbye "chubby", "big-nose"...
We'll be heroes.
You could screw all the girls you want.
Even Jeanne?
You'll have to hide from her to have some peace.
What if we die?
Only if we get caught.
So?
- Okay, agreed.
- Swear.
- Again?
- Swear, I said.
I swear to blow up the bridge with you.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Little thug!
Not in a church.
I never know what you mean.
- Oh, it stinks!
- Shh!
- It's me.
Don't get scared.
- What are you doing?
I'm not telling you.
You blabbermouth.
Tell me or I call Mom.
I'm getting a mine, with Frédo.
- What for?
- To blow up the bridge.
I want to come with you.
- No.
- You never take me anywhere.
It's dangerous.
You know.
If caught, we could die for France.
Why can't I die for France?
You're too small.
And you got jaundice.
I'm fed up.
I can never do anything.
Listen.
If you want to help me, get in bed and shut up.
I don't want to help you, I want to come with you.
If I die, I'll give you all my toys.
The tin-soldiers, the wooden animals...
Everything.
And even your slingshot?
Yes, but you must get in bed.
Thanks.
Deal.
Bye.
Oh boy!
I told you.
It's full of Krauts.
No.
There're only four.
Yes, but the bridge... it is huge.
No.
That's because it's night.
Everything looks big, you know.
- You think so?
- Yeah.
I don't care.
I'm going back home.
- Get serious!
If you leave I scream.
- You're such a bastard.
Do you see that tree?
Yes.
We bend it, put a mine on top, and hop, on their heads.
Look, they can't see us here.
I think I have diarrhea.
Don't shit your pants before we start.
- Take your pick.
- What for?
To know who's going to dig up the mine.
I'm not going.
I don't even know how.
It's easy...
You poke it in.
And when it's hard, it's a mine.
And then, very, very slowly... you get it out.
Frédo!
Let me go.
Stop, I wanna go home.
Stop.
You're going to tear my sock.
Light over there!
No, more to the right!
Hurry!
Pierre-Marie...
I don't want to die.
Just raise your hands, and they won't kill us.
- Pierre-Marie...
- What?
- That's it!
- "That's it" what?
I shat myself.
It's coming from up there.
There!
Just two kids.
When I think that I was afraid...
- Well?
- It's just two kids.
"Two kids"?
Get them out of there!
Alright, chief.
Come on, kids.
Let's go.
You rascals.
- Move.
- Little thugs.
Little prick, prick, prick.
I told you it wasn't possible.
"We'll be heroes" he said.
It's your fault for not getting out of there.
Why did I listen to you?
I'm in big trouble.
My father will yell at me, and even slap me.
- I think I have another idea.
- Oh...
Not with me.
Some other stupid thing.
I'm splitting.
Chicken shit.
Pussy ass.
Shit stinker.
- Big-Nose!
- Fatso!
Take this.
Oh, the idiot.
He did it.
Not even a warning.
- Did you hear planes?
- No.
- Why is that chair there?
- I don't know.
- What happened?
- We don't know, Yvette, dear.
- Go get dressed.
- Don't catch cold.
Hush!
The kids.
It was quite a strange sound.
They're sound asleep.
Alfred!
What are you doing like that?
Nothing, Dad.
- Speak.
- Well...
Nothing...
What?
- What do I get for not telling?
- Nothing.
- Or I'll tell you kissed Robert.
- I don't care.
Here they come.
I assure you, he slept like an angel.
- What is it?
- Stop pretending.
What have you done?
- I was sleeping.
- Disguised as a Senegalese?
- Frédo told me about the bridge.
- He's lying.
- It's true.
Liar!
- Like father, like son.
- Okay, Mom.
- Instead of Mozart, you got Bonaparte.
A child alone cannot blow up the bridge.
Where were you when it exploded?
- In the hallway.
- Liar.
It's true.
Yvette was taking a bath in the kitchen.
You see.
He hasn't left the house.
The bridge is really blown up.
- The bridge is blown up?
- That's right.
They're on alert everywhere.
If the Germans hear about it, they'll think it was him...
and you.
What can we do?
Nothing at all.
Let's hope the real saboteurs get caught soon.
- Nice attitude.
- Madam!
Hostages were shot last week for much less.
Excuse her, brigadier.
Since the accident she's very emotional.
- You were watching Yvette naked?
- Ouch!
The Krauts!
Quick!
The Krauts are here.
What are you doing?
- We're hiding Pierre-Marie.
- Because of the Krauts.
You've got balls.
Thanks for the bridge.
Now Jocelyne won't have to leave.
It's true Pierre-Marie, you're really a good guy.
You can tell us at recess.
At noon, as usual.
Hey!
They caught the English who blew up the bridge.
The Krauts shot them this morning.
Dirty liar.
- Pretentious twit.
- A hero, right!
- I never said it was me.
- You didn't deny it either.
What's this fight about?
Rascals!
Are we done?
- Hey, Big-Nose, prepare to be butchered.
- Come on, get in.
Filthy Jew.
Pierre-Marie?
What are you doing here?
If mother Gendron saw you breaking bottles in her dining room.
If your parents know you are playing hookey, you're going to be in a lot of trouble.
What is going on in that head?
You're a real Tézé.
Stubborn as a mule.
Come with me to your grandfather's grave.
It'll clear your mind.
Your grandfather dug up mines in 1914, but you don't have to.
In fact, his Negroes did it.
Congratulations!
Great sight.
I don't hold the English in my heart, but now I say:
Well done, Tommies.
The "fritz" are cooked.
Let's pick some flowers for your grandfather.
- White or blue?
- Whatever.
A pretty bouquet.
- Say, granny...
- Yes?
What's a Jew?
Ah!
A Jew...
That's someone...
That's someone who isn't like us.
Why?
For example, Negroes are not like us, and we can see they're not like us.
With Jews it's worse, because you can't see it.
But how can we recognize them?
Perhaps by their nose.
What about their nose?
It is hooked.
It is long and hooked.
And also because they're rich doing nothing.
- How can they be rich doing nothing?
- That we don't know.
Granny, when I grow up, I want to be Jewish.
No.
You're French, Catholic, and proud to be so.
What are they doing?
Will you please stop immediately!
It's an order!
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?
As you can see, Madam, we're filling the hole.
What hole?
This is my husband's grave.
We can't leave the road like this.
You rather have everyone trample his grave?
No.
But we were given orders.
Well, go ahead.
- Grandma!
- You stay there.
Bury me with him, since you got your orders.
But Madam...
- Get out.
- No!
Ask the mayor to put a plaque there for your husband.
- A plaque?
With his name?
- Yes, Madam.
Good.
Pierre-Marie, you go back to school.
I'll take care of your grandfather.
See you soon, Émile.
Jocelyne!
Hey, Jocelyne?
"Jocelyne!
Jocelyne..."
- Here, this is for you.
- Processed chocolate?
Thank you, but I hate it.
It smells like vomit.
Thank you.
Hey, I like it.
Here.
No.
That's enough, or I'll get sick.
You like it, huh?
- I can tell you never had real chocolate.
- Why?
You like it?
Once, my father brought me some from Paris.
- I've never eaten anything so good.
- I can get you as much as you want.
- Really?
- I swear.
How many you want?
2, 3 bars?
- What does Big-Nose want?
- He says he can get me chocolate.
If it's like the bridge, you're not getting any.
- You bloody...
- Stop, Pierre-Marie!
Stop!
- We'll meet again.
- Yeah.
Count on it.
You're lucky they stopped me.
Blondie!
Have you seen your schnoz?
You're a real bastard for not telling me you had chocolate.
You have for the chicks, but for your pal, zilch!
It's just bogus, I don't have any.
But we'll find a way to get some.
You will.
Not me.
- Looking for someone?
- I was just walking...
Go walk elsewhere, little thug.
Where did you pinch this?
It's silk.
It's for sale if you're interested.
You sell stockings?
Come over here, little bunny.
- Here's your shandy, kiddo.
- Thanks, Madam.
Sit down.
Thanks, Madam.
You're awfully well-behaved, I must say.
Nice stuff.
Can I ask where it comes from?
You swiped it, eh?
Whatever.
I don't care.
The problem is, it's not my size.
Blanche!
Blanche, come here for one second.
You like it?
- Yes, Mrs. Dora?
- Look at that.
Oh!
- Wow, it's silk.
- Of course.
Try them on.
Thank you, Mrs. Dora.
Haven't seen such nice ones since I left Brest.
They're so soft.
It's so nice.
Good.
How much do you want?
Isn't it enough?
You'll do well in business.
Nice.
A gift?
"Gift"...
That's easily said.
- So, how much do you want?
- I don't want money, Madam.
Hey, you're an early bloomer!
You like her, huh?
I'd like chocolate.
The real stuff...
One bar, please.
We have none, kiddo.
- But they said that...
- "They" talk nonsense.
Here is the news bulletin.
Wait, honey.
We have no chocolate, but perhaps we can find some.
Huh, Blanche?
- What's your name again?
- Uh...
Frédo.
Blanche?
The German troops fled, blending in with the refugee convoys.
In Ukraine, after the annihilation...
Russia "gross".
Um...
And "Deutschland, kaputt."
Okay, Frédo.
If you bring another pair in two days, and one pair size 44...
remember that!
I'll get the chocolate.
One bar of real chocolate.
Let's shake on it, little bunny.
Word of honor!
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- A drink.
- Please, dear.
Blanche!
Frédo!
In the meantime, give this to your mother.
Come on.
Thank you, Madam.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
What are you doing here?
I have a present for you.
A present?
- What is it?
- Open it.
- You nicked them from your mother?
- Not at all.
I bought them for your birthday.
- That was in January.
- I know.
I'm really late, but as they say...
Damn, I dunno what they say.
- Put them on.
- Okay.
- They look good on you!
- Thank you.
I'll have the chocolate tomorrow as planned.
Okay.
- Why do you like Paulo better?
- I dunno.
I like you too.
You make me laugh.
You're a good friend.
And Paulo makes you laugh as well?
No...
Well...
It's not the same.
Good.
I must go home.
Thank you.
- Goodbye.
- You're welcome.
Fidelio hasn't been decided yet.
The Kommandantur is stalling.
Even Beethoven is subversive now...
Where's your mother?
Madeleine, come eat!
Show your hands.
It's okay.
Ah!
Oh, Madeleine!
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
I just want to look pretty.
- I forgot a special date.
- Not at all.
- And those trinkets?
- These?
Ask your son.
Paulette brought them just now.
He gave them to Jocelyne.
Where do they come from?
- They have the same at Robillard.
- Nobody asked you.
- You stole them?
- Perhaps he found them.
- Gold jewelry in the street?
- They're not real gold.
Did you steal them?
Okay.
Tomorrow we go to Robillard to find out.
I didn't steal them, I traded them.
With whom?
With Fernande.
Jeanne Blanchet's big sister.
For what?
For what?
You won't be pleased.
- Silk stockings.
- Oh!
I did like you, I took the stockings.
- Barter is a bad example for these kids.
- How would you eat, if I didn't barter?
As for you!
Silk stockings are not cheap.
So please undo the exchange tomorrow.
Okay?
Not tomorrow.
She left.
She'll be back in two days.
- We'll see.
For now, off to bed.
- Go!
Pierre-Marie.
There!
You didn't steal that one!
Little heathen.
To bed hungry will teach him!
For our prisoners.
- Till this evening, my bunny.
- Thank you, Madam.
Those ladies are very generous.
- Vulgar, but generous.
- With the Krauts' money...
- Prisoners don't mind.
- You're wrong, Louise.
Prisoners don't like collaborators' money.
- What?
- Mom...
- You don't like my money?
- Not in front of the Lord's house.
Ladies, take your money.
Please, Dora, no scandal.
You usually leave your money with an elastic.
This note smells like a "tart".
- Are you calling me a tart?
You old bat!
- Please, Madam.
A little dignity.
Tone it down.
You are not morally superior.
What does that mean?
Did you hear that, darling?
My wife is right.
A little dignity.
Dignity...
She's tough, that one.
- We know you deal with the local hicks.
- We're at war, Madam.
We get by.
What do you think I do?
Lace is my specialty, and my ass is all I have for defense.
You can be proud of the show you offer the occupier.
Here!
That's what poor Gabriel would have done!
And you, go home!
Kiddo.
- That was a close call.
- Why?
- I know those girls.
- Oh?
Yes.
Upon leaving, she gave me the earrings.
I understand your fear.
If she doesn't return the stockings, you're screwed.
You'll see, she's really nice.
You think she'll show her thighs?
I'm gonna get a boner.
Wow, what a ride!
- It's the G engine.
- Yeah, it is.
Come on.
- Go ahead.
- After you, Pierre-Marie.
- You first.
- You know the place better.
No!
Poor kid, there's no chocolate.
And I'll tell you, He doesn't care for your stockings.
He won't need them in Russia.
Aren't you Tézé's son by any chance?
Ah, if your mother only knew!
Right, she wants the stockings back.
Well, your earrings.
Now be nice, big guy.
It will be dark, and you haven't made it to Saint-Malo.
Another one.
Don't start any problems.
- Go outside.
- No.
I'm not leaving.
Room.
I'm staying.
You're becoming a pain in the ass.
Get out!
Raus!
I'm telling you this... for you.
I'm not the one going to jail.
Good luck, big guy.
You're both still here?
Your mother wants her stockings back?
My brother spilled the beans.
Did you hear, Blanche?
Frédo here wants his stockings back.
Well my bunny, come and get them.
Come on, scram.
Well then, I can't hear you back there!
Stop.
Your damned farm is too far away.
I have to go home.
Or else my dad is gonna yell at me again.
You're such a pain.
The farmer may not have the stockings anymore.
Go back if you want.
I won't go home without the stockings.
But you're stupid.
You'll just get a beating and that's it.
This is a bad time to...
Look.
It's the Kraut's bike from the inn.
He won't make it to Saint-Malo, if he stops at every bar along the way.
Let's get out of here.
Wait, I have an idea.
Oh...
What?
- What if we puncture his tires?
- You're crazy.
- I don't care.
It's none of my business.
- Look.
He can't see us.
- If he leaves we have time to run away.
- I don't want to.
You'll see, we'll have a good laugh.
- No.
I don't want to.
- Come on.
Okay, here we go.
It's okay.
Come on, come on.
Take the front wheel.
- Did you find the valve?
- Yes.
- He left his machine gun.
- Damn, don't touch that!
Oh my.
It's heavy.
What are you doing?
Friends...
Stop!
Don't move.
Stop.
Please don't kill me, sir!
- Me prisoner.
- "Prisoner"?
Me, your prisoner.
- It's not possible.
You go.
I go.
- No, no.
House.
Your house.
But I can't.
Huh?
Papa terrorist, huh?
No.
Papa opera singer.
What?
Okay, okay.
Let's go to your house.
- Your house.
- No.
- Your house.
- No.
House.
Cellar.
- What's that?
- House.
House...
If you talk, me house,
You "kaput",
Mom "kaput",
Dad "kaput".
Everyone "kaput".
Do you understand?
Do you understand me?
Ah!
Good morning, ladies.
Hope you slept well.
What a lovely day.
Hello, Mother.
Hello, young Yvette.
The sun is shining, the sky is blue, and I have good news.
Madeleine?
Hello.
How is young Tézé?
The authorization has arrived.
Rehearsals begin in 2 weeks.
Young Yvette, coffee.
- You're not ready yet?
- I think I'm sick.
What are you coming down with?
- He's not hot.
- Should take his temperature.
- You got a headache?
- Don't know.
I feel pretty bad.
- I'll give him a mustard plaster.
- We'll keep him home.
- And me?
- But you're not sick.
- Yvette, there's no more butter.
- I'll go to the cellar.
- No, I'll go.
- Surely not.
You'd catch a cold.
Yvette, go ahead.
Thank you.
- Jean Charles?
- Yes, please.
Ah...
- The whistling friends are there.
- I'll go...
Stay!
I'll get it.
What does Fidelio say?
Hello, Alfred.
Hello, I'm here for Pierre-Marie.
He's sick.
He's not going to school.
Can you tell the Principal, and bring his homework?
- Yes, Madam.
- Thank you.
Goodbye, Madam.
Here's the butter.
- It's all that's left?
- Yes.
That ran out quickly.
Go, my daughter.
Don't forget your schoolbag.
Yvette, is it all okay?
Yes.
Why do you ask?
- There's nothing more in the cellar.
- Already?
- I'll go to the farm tomorrow.
- It's urgent.
- Is there really nothing?
- We are many.
It goes quickly.
- I mean, is it empty?
- Yes.
What do you want there to be?
Nothing.
It must be the fever.
I'm going to bed.
Did you look behind the green boxes?
I looked everywhere.
Pierre-Marie?
Come here a second.
Weren't you in bed?
- Where are you going?
- To the yard.
If you can go to the yard, you can go to school.
Exactly, I'm off to bed.
I have a headache.
The last two pairs of stockings.
The last two.
By the way...
Did you return the earrings to Fernande?
- Well, just...
- I think you're not sick at all.
You're just afraid of meeting Fernande.
- No, Mom, I swear!
- Go get dressed, we'll go together.
- But it's not possible.
- Why not?
- I lost them.
- No problem.
We'll buy new ones.
Get moving!
Mom...
- I lied.
- Ah, there you go!
It's not true!
Pierre-Marie, tell me it's not true!
- Isn't it a bit too big?
- Take it or leave it.
It's the last one.
What a disgrace!
What's going on?
Your grand-son, Bonaparte, traded with the girls at the Inn of Happiness.
What?
The earrings, the silk stockings...
- If his father finds out, he'll kill him.
- He is reaching new heights, I must say.
Why you kept quiet?
I would've paid for the damned earrings.
I'm gonna give them a piece of my mind!
No, Madeleine.
Not in your condition.
I forbid you.
I am your mother.
I bet those whores have ruined the stockings by now.
Go to your room right now and stay there.
He's incorrigible!
Excuse me?
Excuse me...
Well, what shall I do?
Come back when you have bigger tits.
Oh!
What nerve!
I won't set foot in this shop again.
Come here, boy.
You haven't left?
I'm hungry.
I'm hungry!
Get me something to eat.
Come on!
Hush.
- Oh!
- Did you sleep well, Marguerite?
Listen, Louise.
I know this not my home, but still.
I find it petty to hide my bucket...
Your bucket?
- I had to get up and couldn't fall asleep.
- It wasn't me.
I'd never do such a thing.
- What, it wasn't you?
- Of course not.
That's impossible.
There are no rats here.
Yvette, there was more than half a loaf yesterday.
I wrapped it myself.
- The bacon is also gone.
I dislike bacon.
- Me too.
What the hell!
There is no soap?
Everything's disappearing in this house.
- Pierre-Marie?
- So is it always me?
Yes, it's always you.
What have you cooked up now?
And I'm expecting another one that will annoy me for years.
All my youth wasted because of...
Here!
That'll teach you to make your mother cry.
Madeleine!
Okay.
Go to school now!
I'll deal with you when you get back, buddy!
And clean that!
Oh, Madeleine!
Did you do it?
I'm not talking to snitches.
♪ When you are there at cherry time
♪ if you're scared of heartaches
♪ avoid the pretty girls.
♪ I, who am not afraid of harsh treatment,
♪ I won't live without suffering some day.
♪ When you are there...
- Bomb alarm.
- It's starting again.
Mom, take your shawl.
Come on, everybody goes downstairs.
Maybe it's not for us...
A stray bomb, and bang!
Not the cellar.
I have homework.
- Better a live donkey than a dead scholar.
- Don't get me mad!
I said downstairs!
It's the first time he wants to do his homework.
Yvette, to the cellar!
How can I possibly get in?
Watch your head, Madeleine.
- Oh, my God!
- I am scared!
- What's he doing here?
- Well, say something.
Jean-Charles.
- Jean-Charles, talk to him.
- Wait a second.
Jean-Charles Tézé.
War, not good.
This is our home.
He had to take shelter.
- How did he get in?
- He must've gone through the yard.
You can stay with us during the raid.
You stay calm.
In safety.
Mom!
- I'm scared.
- Don't be scared.
You want to drink?
He doesn't understand French.
Yet these barbarians have been here for 4 years.
Well, it's not for us.
Phew!
Alarm over.
Planes left.
It's over, darling.
You can leave.
- I thought you spoke German.
- No.
I sing in German.
So you don't understand what you sing, after 20 years.
What matters is the accent.
I, prisoner.
- What does he mean?
- I dunno.
No, no.
You're free.
You're free.
I, prisoner.
He's crazy.
Go tell the Kommandantur there's a nutter in our cellar.
Mom is right.
Try to distract him, I'm going.
Don't go, Dad.
He's not crazy.
I took him prisoner.
What?
Look at me.
Tell me it's not true?
But that's impossible.
Look at your son.
It's true, but it's not my fault.
There!
- Tell the truth!
- I beg you, don't use their methods.
Yvette, go up with Thérèse.
I demand the truth.
Me, prisoner of him.
Let's hear it.
Yvette, don't leave.
I'm scared.
I'm scared as well.
What can we do?
We should hand over this deserter to his own.
Imagine Jean-Charles telling an SS: "I've been hiding a deserter for 3 days."
Not to mention the he'll say exactly the opposite.
That will put you in front of a firing squad in no time.
What if we ask aunt Mélise?
She would be thrilled with the gift.
No.
We would all take refuge there.
And the other would stay downstairs?
You're kidding!
If his yells and his comrades show up, he'll hide his gun and say that he's our prisoner, and we'll still be in front of a firing squad.
We're stuck.
We're stuck.
And all because of your "venerable" son.
To think that Bourdonnet will pinch Fidelio from me...
I can just forget about it!
Two years of preparation.
- My costume is ready.
- Not quite.
Well... almost.
Destiny is sometimes cruel.
(Speaks with quivering voice, mocking her)
- That's not nice.
- That's how it is.
- What if we contact the Resistance?
- Good idea.
- Will they help us?
- Yes.
And do you know where your Resistance is?
Duh.
(He speaks German)
What's he saying?
He has sore ribs.
Well, that's good.
And his back and kidneys.
- Ah, he wants suction cups.
- Obviously.
- Suction cups.
- They're over there.
In the cupboard.
My jam jars!
Come!
Come on.
I don't know if I'll tolerate his manners very long.
Ah, you don't know?
It makes me die laughing.
There's sweeping to do.
That'll be the day!
It's my radio.
It'll stay here.
He wants it.
Filthy Fritz.
Put it on!
What are you waiting for?
Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Some white wine, Mr. Pierre, please.
- I'll get it for you.
We can't say that spring spoils us.
Yes, it could be worse.
- Will you raise a glass with me?
- I don't mind if I do.
The gentleman too?
You want a drink, Roger?
- With pleasure.
- Cheers.
- Ladies gentlemen.
- Cheers.
Could you do me a favor?
That depends.
Excuse me.
Could you tell me where I can find the Resistance?
FFI or FTP?
- What do you recommend?
- It depends on what you want.
But I can't help you.
You can't have a business and blow up trains.
- What does he want?
- He's looking for the Resistance.
Do they need singers in the underground?
You can't miss them.
You go into the woods and sing:
Yahoo, the Resistance!
But it's not for me.
There are none of these birds in the countryside.
My brother-in-law was looking for them for 15 days.
It's just as well.
They stick bombs everywhere...
- but whose ass is on the line?
- That's us.
We're not in favor of the Krauts, but they should keep quiet.
- They have killed as many as the Fritz.
- Nice Resistance!
Your turn.
So Roger, what do you think of this?
I am not interested in these stories myself.
He's from Normandy.
Okay, thank you anyway.
I count on your discretion.
You know what I mean?
- Keep the rest.
- Thank you, Mr. Tézé.
- Goodbye.
- Gentlemen.
I've got to go as well.
Bye, Pierre.
Bye, Roger.
What is it?
- Do you have a light?
- No.
I don't smoke.
It's bad for my throat.
That's okay, I don't have cigarettes.
Are you looking for the Resistance?
You shouldn't listen to them.
They are chatterboxes.
I know where you can find the Resistance.
- Really?
- Go see Mr. Guivard on my behalf.
Wait, wait.
- Guivard... the constable?
- Yes.
- Who are you?
- Roger Gonet.
Roger Gonet...
Police station.
The Resistance?
Why are you looking for the Resistance?
Well, just imagine I have a friend... well, an acquaintance, who happened to have a funny adventure.
Rather a mishap, I should say.
It's possible you could help him.
As I know you a little, I took the liberty...
You have done well, Mr. Tézé.
- I...
- Yes?
He has a stowaway in his basement.
- Have you talked about it?
- Of course not.
How long has he been harboring him?
Three days.
Does your friend live around here?
Yes.
No plane was shot down in the region.
How did he get there?
- Exactly...
- Never mind.
You've come to the right place.
We'll get him back to camp Broualan.
They need instructors there.
- English or American?
- You see...
- This is important.
- Please...
That's the problem.
He's neither one nor the other.
He's German.
German?
Not only is the German armed, but your friend also lives in the main street.
The Resistance can't attack.
At the first shot, his colleagues will show up.
- I said so!
- Three days?
Hans Hermann, disappeared between Rennes and Saint-Malo on the night of May 18.
If the Germans learn that he's here, it will be a disaster.
What would you advise my friend?
I would keep him nice and warm and let the storm pass.
It's terrible what you're telling me.
Good luck, mister Tézé.
If I have news, I'll let you know.
For your friend.
It's terrible.
Oh, it's terrible.
It's terrible.
Here we are with this Ostrogoth until the end of the war.
- All that thanks to your son.
- But you're wrong.
You should be proud to have a German prisoner at home.
I beg you, it's not you who has to look after him.
What is it?
The German wants a corkscrew.
It's getting worse!
If he's thinking he can drink my good bottles...
- Wouldn't you rather tell him?
- Get out.
Wait.
He's quite capable of breaking my good bottles.
After the war, you'll enlist as a cabin boy.
Stop yelling at him.
Don't you realize?
We are the hostages.
- You'll leave with the children.
- Certainly not.
If we change our habits, people will ask questions.
The shop will remain open and you go on with Fidelio.
But we can send Thérèse and grandmother to my aunt.
To a farm?
Rather death than defilement.
- Mom, it's for your own good.
- Never!
- You can be proud of yourself, murderer!
- You exaggerate!
We shouldn't send them to school.
- A good chickenpox...
- Nice!
More importantly, we keep quiet.
You understand, Yvette?
- It's a matter of life or death.
- Yes, Madam.
Let me tell you...
This will all work out.
After the war we'll laugh.
In the meantime, I'll empty his shit.
Mom?
Mom, will you wash my back, like before?
Do it yourself.
I don't want to hear you.
- Mom, talk to me, please.
- I don't want to talk to you anymore.
Stop calling me Mom.
I've had it with your stupidities.
You're incorrigible.
It's not my fault.
- Is it mine perhaps?
- It's Jocelyne's fault.
- Jocelyne?
- She doesn't love me.
You don't love me either.
- Nobody loves me.
- What's that you're telling me?
Only Frédo.
My darling.
I don't see why we go on, everything is ruined.
- What is it?
- Hush.
Go, scram.
Ah, there you are.
It's been a while.
- So, is he in your cellar?
- Who?
You phoney bastard!
I heard your father speak to mine.
I know everything.
- Where you going?
- Go see the Kraut.
- Stop.
- Why?
- He's not only yours.
He's our prisoner.
- I took him prisoner.
Thanks to me.
I left him to you.
You had the gun.
You ran away.
Coward.
I can see what you're after!
You'll tell everyone you did everything.
Not a chance.
If this gets out, we all get shot.
Oh?
Are you sure?
- Have you told anyone?
- No, I didn't have time.
- So you shut up.
Mum's the word.
- Yes, I swear.
- So you want to see him?
- Oh, your bowl.
Darn it.
Oh, jackass!
You'll see when we meet again!
Sorry!
I didn't mean to.
Excuse me, sir.
I won't do it again.
Cabbage soup.
She's a pretty girl.
Yeah.
I screwed her.
"I screwed her?"
I screwed her.
You, you slept with her?
Now, really...
Not well up there, eh?
Yes...
Like that.
Oh, like that?
Man.
Woman...
Woman... not like this, like that.
Woman like this.
Man, woman.
That is screwing.
Baby, like this, like that.
Scram.
"In the attack of 31 August 1918, before Crécy..."
That's good.
"Under machine gun fire..."
"and artillery,"
"he led his company..."
Pay attention to the "p".
"With an unusual energy..."
What a man!
No.
Don't write that.
"With..."
Ah!
Someone's there.
- Hello, Madam.
- Hello.
- Is Mrs. Hamon there?
- No.
- Ah.
And Madeleine?
- Not either.
They left to try to get food supplies.
I'm keeping the store.
I brought an old dress of mine... and I want it tailored for Jocelyne.
Ah, they grow so fast.
Unfortunately, I know nothing about sewing.
- But they won't be long.
- We'll wait.
- How's Pierre-Marie?
He's never around.
- Better.
Much better, thanks.
You can visit with him, keep him company.
- Can I?
- Go.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I was doing a dictation.
- Are you good in spelling?
- So-so.
- It's beautiful.
- And look at this.
It would suit me well.
It's for my father's costume.
Frédo gave me your letter.
It's very nice, but I already told you.
- But you kissed me the other day.
- It was to thank you.
It's not the same.
- You dislike me because of the chocolate.
- I don't care about the chocolate.
- And I never believed you.
- You're wrong.
I almost had it.
- You don't believe me?
- You talk a lot, but you don't do much.
Don't do much?
Come, you'll see.
- Where to?
- You'll see.
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll see.
- Let me go.
Come on.
- No!
- You think I cannot read your intentions?
- I just want to show you something.
You think I'm an idiot?
Paulo already pulled the cellar trick on me.
I beg you.
- I won't go in the cellar with you.
- Why not?
- I don't want to.
- Come on.
No.
You'll see what I've done for you.
- Pierre-Marie!
- Yes, Mom?
Go to your room.
- What did he want?
- Nothing.
- What were you talking about?
- Nothing.
We were playing.
Okay, come help me.
Ah, she looks pretty.
What do you think?
It's a bit long, right?
She's a young girl.
Krauts straight ahead.
- Damn!
- There's a kid up there.
This is an insult to the German army!
You are a living example of the collapse of your country.
Do you understand?
A people that neglects the education of their children is a decadent people.
- He's a child, sir.
He'll apologize.
- I should hope so.
I'm sorry.
Ask me to forgive you.
It's not the same thing.
Please forgive me.
What's wrong?
- What did you do?
- Is this your son?
I won't congratulate you.
He will tell you what he did.
Right, young man?
I spat on the gentleman's cap.
And you are aware of the possible sanctions.
We will compensate you, sir.
You must have some pretty silk stockings for the officer.
Do you think you can buy the honor of a German officer with silk?
But you are talking nonsense.
No, but I just wanted...
Quick, Thérèse, to the cellar.
Go quickly...
- Don't you know the cellar is flooded?
- Oh...
Sorry, sir, we won't be able to shelter you.
I didn't ask anything, Madam.
Only you can protect yourselves from your American friends.
Good luck.
It will be crowded.
You're asking for it!
What on earth were you thinking?
- What if they had come down?
- Jean Charles!
- We are tired of your foolishness.
- Stop.
What!
He's my son!
Come.
Come.
- Just what we needed.
- Mado, my matches.
I see you.
And the little Missy.
You...
Not good.
Little Missy...
You...
I, many "fräulein".
Pierre-Marie
Pierre-Marie.
Come, that's enough.
- What did he want?
- I don't know.
He was speaking German.
Everybody scram.
Raus.
What?
Raus!
- He thinks he's at home.
- They are at home.
Of course.
Our home is their home.
Château Margaux 1932...
Oh well.
(Singing in Latin)
Dad!
Excuse me, Madam.
What's up?
- It's the German.
- What?
Hush.
- He's coughing.
- Really?
He's coughing so hard he can heard from the street.
- He wants honey for...
- Good.
Okay...
I took your bike to get here.
I'm just saying so you don't worry.
- Be careful.
- Sure, Dad.
- Your son is cute.
- Oh yes.
Shall we go on?
Jocelyne?
Jocelyne?
- I brought you something.
- What?
- A letter.
- From whom?
- From me.
- Never mind, I know what's in it.
I doubt it.
Read.
- I've already said no.
- Go ahead.
Read.
I wrote it.
"My dear Jocelyne, I thought it well."
"You're not for me."
"You shouldn't play with the heart of men."
"I don't want to see you anymore."
- What did you write here?
- "Raus"?
Yeah. "Raus" means "scram".
"Raus!" Why have you written "Raus"?
- Do you speak German now?
- No.
It's like that.
"Raus!"
"Raus!"
Wait.
Well, you told me "raus", so...
You want a ride on my bike?
Goodbye, "Raus".
I don't understand why you're doing all this.
I feel it's a bit my fault.
I don't have much time to take care of you, big guy.
It's true that you grew up.
You're almost a man, huh.
But you will always be my little one.
- I promise I'll never do anything stupid.
- Yes.
It's hard for everyone now.
But after the war, we'll go on a big trip together.
Really?
- To China?
- Maybe not, no.
But we'll take a big boat.
How big?
As big as a house.
Madeleine?
Go sleep.
I'll come hug you.
And behave yourselves.
- Please Mom, go on.
- Yes, tell us more.
I'm going to help Dad rehearse.
- Where are you going?
- None of your business.

- Dad...
- I hate to be disturbed.
The German wants you to stop singing.
He cannot sleep.
Great.
You see?
Tell your German friend to fuck himself!
- Better that than being deaf.
- Are you referring to me?
No.
No.
It's for the...
- I don't know why I don't slap you?
- Go to bed.
Go!
- Mom, will you tell us a story?
- Yes.
- Shall we go on?
- Don't think so!
I'm upset!
That cut me off!
And I lost interest.
There!
- How did you do it?
- I told him to shut up.
- And he didn't slap you?
- I know a trick.
Wow!
You're really good!
- Don't go sleep, Mom will be back.
- Great!
Pierre-Marie?
Pierre-Marie?
Pierre-Marie, answer me.
Come on.
I know you're there.
I don't want to see you either.
But I would like to tell you in person.
Come on!
Finally, everything got better.
I had become a prophet in my land by virtue of my stupidity.
My father feared me like the plague, and my mother was affectionate again.
As for Jocelyne, I just had to snap my fingers.
Then disaster struck.
The Americans are in Normandy.
On June 6, 1944, allied forces landed in Normandy, annihilating all my efforts, all of a sudden.
However, some weeks later...
Well?
The Americans...
They are on the road.
Farewell, Fidelio.
Just a few more weeks...
Farewell also to the German in the cellar.
♫ Singing the Marseillaise, the French National Anthem ♫
Hush!
Mr. Tézé!
Mr. Tézé!
- It's the Resistance.
- They arrive when the show's over.
- Better late than never.
- What is it?
Nothing.
Mr. Tézé?
- Yes?
- We come for the merchandise.
- What merchandise?
- Your prisoner.
- We got you you an armband.
- You arrive a month late.
We did what we could.
- Where's your German?
- Right, you're too late.
The bastard fled into the night.
- He was the only one we had.
- Put yourself in his place.
Keep it.
You've earned it.
Do you have 5 minutes for a drink?
That's nice of you, but we don't have time.
Get off me!
Raus.
Bravo, Hans!
We sure fooled them.
Still we had a good laugh.
Good luck, buddy.
Look.
Look what they gave me.
- You know why?
- Oh yes.
- You want some?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
- You really are a funny guy.
- Right.
Next time you want me to go into the cellar, I'll think about it.
- What about Paulo?
- Oh, he's a jerk.
That's my buddy.
Just ask me if you have any questions.
That's him.
My cousin Laurence.
Hello.
Are you coming, Pierre-Marie?
I'd like to tell you something.
Give me a minute.
- You want some chocolate?
- Chocolate?
No.
What I've been dreaming of, is an orange.
Oranges?
I can get you as many as you want.
Right, Frédo?
Yes!

Bye-bye Bye-bye
Maniac!
Come on...!
Come on!
George, George!
You scared me!
I'll kill you!
What's wrong?
You're blocking the road
Drive it away!
Quick!
Quick!
Buddy, go and answer it!
I've just gone to bed.
Take it easy!
Has your wife left you?
You take much interest in that dancing girl case
There was another similar case last night
That means 4 altogether but the police have been silent about this
You'll have much to gain from such coverage
Chen used to be in charge of it, but I've transferred him to other cases
Why are you always so pragmatic?
Turn it down if you're so sympathetic.
But don't blame me if you can't get on
If I won a No.1 lottery, I'd quit right away
Well, it's up to you.
Take it or leave it
Who'd act if there was no first hand info?
The boss has given orders to get going
Let me finish
The address?
Ming's waiting at Te Yi Site, Homantin.
Go now
Get going!
Go now
Ming.
What happened?
A homicide!
Are you the first arrival at the spot?
Yes, sir
Are you sure no one has been there?
Don't patrol anymore Yes, sir
Report back to Ad Hoc Committee at once Yes, sir
Don't divulge what you've seen to a third party
Yes, sir Unless you've my order
Yes, sir Go back now
Yes, sir
Remove the body from the scene quickly
Keep it a secret and stop reporters from taking photos
Yes, sir Follow me
Yes, sir
Only an ordinary case
And there's female corpse upstairs
Don't exaggerate.
To you, all cases are serious
But the police are taking them seriously
It is about a taxi dancer?
Almost right.
Get a scoop at once
Catch the wind for me
Halt!
Strep!
Jump down!
How did you come up?
I run
This district is now barred from entry
You're the first man who told me of it
Give me the camera!
Search him!
Turn around
Stop!
Stop!
You've no right to do that.
I'll sue you for
Obstructing news freedom and destroying private property
Do it to complaint!
The number is 855051
Report against me!
Let him go
Take him away!
Don't!
You can't hide the truth
Something will happen sooner or later
Fat Piao, you're the cockiest reporter
Next time I'll suspend your certificate
Kill me then, Inspector Chen
Don't raise your head.it's nothing
News!
A car accident occurred last night
A girl driver run down a man who disappeared
Have you got that girl's address?
Yes.
Contact the deceased family.
I'll do that girl
Who are you looking for?
Are you Miss Lin, please?
You ran down a man in Homantin last night but he disappeared
May I know the details?
Which dept, are you from?
I'm a reporter
Right!
Miss Lin
My hand...
Are you alright?
It was so abrupt that I didn't see him clearly
I got out to see how he was
At the moment a dual-purpose van passed
I turned around and he was out of sight
It was so eerie that I still feel scared
Could you be dizzy due to the strain?
You don't believe me then?
I was quite sober, I couldn't be wrong
Could it be a cat or a dog you hit?
Impossible!
And when I reported to the police, they interrogate me the whole night, then told me to forget what happened
Did they tell you why?
Next time I see them, I'll ask them
Could you have accidentally hit a killer?
It sounds there is a possibility
Sorry
Sorry for the disturbance.
I must leave
Wish I could taste your nice coffee
You must go.
My half day's leave is over
Bye-bye Bye-bye
Sorry for the accident
No.
You look plump and ok
Bye-bye
Bye-bye.
What a compliment!
Director
So it's you
I have news!
I don't want it!
It's firsthand information!
Don't be in my way!
I'm watching
Brother!
Director!
Give him $200
He gets nothing but phoney news
Don't begrudge this.
You paid more to a dancer
Take it for a loan from me
Well, you've already been paid for the info.,
Yes, Fatty of the Lab says all the deceased died of over bleeding, and this is a fact
Did you inform this to other people?
No, you're the first to get the info.,
Director!
I must have a word with you
Don't block me from watching the show
You have nothing to lose, Come here
Just now that man told me all the deceased died of over bleeding
But there's no bloodstain on the scene
How could it be over bleeding?
Could it be a blood-sucker?
That killer may like human blood
You've seen too many vampire series
Miss, give him tomato juice.
Take it slowly
Director!
You're friend!
Another Teenage Girl Killed by Sex Maniac
The police are helplessly vague about it
What do you mean by that?
We're only reporting the truth
I warn you, Fat Piao, don't try to hog the limelight by dirty means
A young man shouldn't be so impulsive
You may be cursed with a freak son
How vulgar for a policeman
Devote your energy to finding the killer
Don't waste taxpayers money on drinking
Right!
And you!
Sir, is it worthwhile to adopt such dirty means for the sake of circulation?
Don't frame me.
I can finish you off
It's a pity we stand no chance
Inspector, you haven't finished yet
Inspector, don't get excited!
His looks show he was mad with rage
Angie!
Time to be off!
Still 5 minutes, more
It takes time to clock-out!
Have a date with Dennis for the 5:30 show?
Today's the last
Go then
Well.
I'll host breakfast for you tomorrow
May I borrow several books, please?
I'm borrowing these for 2 for my auntie, these 2 for my nurse, and these for my godmother
They're heavy
Why can't you come again for the others?
No, I've not yet borrowed enough for my self
The form's here, sign it!
Is Liao Chi Piao your real name?
Yes, my daddy says the strokes are good
Here I am.
Thank you.
Don't mention it
Any more question?
No, I think
Bye-bye!
Bye-bye!
Miss Lin?
Yes?
There's a party for Saturday.
Shall I call you?
Don't take the trouble
I know you won't be free
Pick me up at 8
I'm punctual.
Bye-bye...
See you then
Don't make mistake in captions or news or these may mislead the readers
Why are you hiding in the typesetting room?
Someone in a bar told everyone...
He saw the deceased in the taxi dancer case
You believe him then?
There's no harm in checking
No, it's okay
Fat Piao!
Anybody in?
Anybody in, please?
Miss
Miss, Miss...
Don't!
Don't!
Listen!
Stop that, or I'll fight back!
Stop that!
I've to find someone
Why were you acting so sneakily?
I called several times without any answer, so I went up to see what happened
You were only trying to make advances
Who on earth are you looking for?
A contact man
Who are you?
I'm a reporter
Look closely
Why didn't you say so?
I could've finished you off
Why do you want to see me?
They say you saw those deceased!
In the taxi dancer case.
I want the details
You've come to the right person
Have you got a cigarette?
A different brand!
Never mind
Hows that case'?
Have you eaten?
Not yet
I can talk freely as a guest
I enjoy being a host
I wish I could bring my girlfriend
Okay, I'll like her
May, eat
You've found a new darling?
My girlfriend is straightforward
Good!
I like straightforward girls
Suicide for love, robberies, rape, accidents
Always the same thing.
Is there nothing new?
Such boring stuff!
Right!
Take it!
Boss, all fixed.
The truth's out
What?
Has the killer surfaced?
Do you know how the deceased died?
Over bleeding
Right, and they were bitten to death
I can prove my inference is correct and he's a blood-sucking monster
You must be out of your mind!
A monster in this enlightened age?
Let me finish
A girl saw him moving furtively on the scene all the deceased died of over bleeding with no bloodstain left
Stop arguing for a while
All the deceased have tooth marks on their necks
Did he tell you that?
He's an eye-witness
Welcome!
Your last name, please?
Mao
Sit down, Mr. Mao.
Serve him
How did it happen?
Speak up!
You'll get your pay
One night, I was ready to go home after drinking
When I came to a car and opened the door, a female corpse dropped out with a bang
And her neck bore toothmarks
Are you sure?
Did you look closely?
Who'd did that when it was nauseating?
Didn't you say it was toothmarks?
Somehow I felt it was toothmarks
Would you do it if this happened in your car?
I was dead scared and fled
Did you inform the police?
Police?
You must be joking
That car is not mine
Whose is it?
No idea
I only enjoy opening car doors
Thank you.
You're...
I'm Mao Mr. Mao
I've many things to do
Let's go out to have coffee
Thank you.
You're...
Don't thank him
You always judge a man by his appearance
No, his behaviour betrays it
After all these years, I've seen much
Only a few years.
I've been in it for a few years
Why are you quiet?
Still angry with me?
In fact, I did not do it purposely
I kept quiet because, you didn't ask me
No, I mean, why does the killer like blood?
He must be a nut.
There's plenty of blood at Red Cross
Why did he kill to get it?
Get in!
Show me your hand!
No
Over there!
You're careless!
Stand up!
What's the matter?
Why are you blood stained?
Why?
Follow me
Open it!
Plenty of blood!
Hush!
Go over there
It's me!
It's me!
You nearly scared me to death!
With so many things in my way, I can't see
Look from below
Quiet...
Go up!
Go!
Why is it missing?
Fatty!
Fatty!
Broker!
Broker!
Broker!
Broker, where are you?
Broker?
Broker...
Where are you?
Broker?
Broker, run!
Broker, watch out!
Broker, run, run!
Come here!
What happened?
Inspector, look!
Stop!
Give chase!
Stop!
Watch out!
Crouch down!
All, crouch down!
What do you mean?
Sit down
I now sue you for intrusion with intent to rob, helping a fugitive, and suspected murder
You did a good frame-up
He's covered with blood.
Take him for a killer
Nonsense
Fatty, you've framed me up
You failed in your mission with so many men and you're blaming it on us
Had you not intervened, he wouldn't have fled
And because, of you, I still have men lying in hospital
You cooked up a ghost story in the hope of getting popular
I can sue you for rumor-mongering too
You fired so many shots without killing him
How could he be human?
You missed!
Shut up if you're smart
Missed?
What a shameless frame-up
Someone saw the deceased with toothmarks, and they all died due to over bleeding
Tell him!
Think it over!
A convict can't testify
Don't worry, we've a lawyer for him
Fatty, don't push me!
Wen Yes, sir
Yes, sir
Only a misunderstanding,fatty.
Forget it
What do you say?
You know it's hard for the police
You make things harder for me then
Well...
Only if you cooperate by keeping last nights case secret, the rest can easily be settled the rest can easily be settled
I trust you only this time
Okay
Take Mr Mao to process
Fatty
I want to know if the shots really missed
Yes, sir
Miss Li, why are you so late?
I had to finish all the trifles.
Bye
Bye-bye
I lost 5 sets of chips to that fatty
So little?
Right
Did you use my perfume for your bath?
I only got smeared with a little
When are you two going to move out?
We won't move out without you
Well, I'm yearning to have a grand child
Do you prefer a boy or a girl?
It makes no difference
Tell me, so I'll act prudently
What a nut!
Bye-bye

Come out!
Come out!
What an idiot!
Why stand there?
Lend a hand
Don't be afraid!
Don't be afraid!
Are you alright?
Yes, but I drank a bit too much
All died for same cause.
How horrible!
I must unveil the case to alarm the public
We can't without knowing the killer's looks
With your help, I'll have a way
Bring them back to position!
Come and get your things now!
Don't drink anymore or you'll be unfit
Don't worry, the wine fits me better
Okay?
Where?
Over there?
Let's go
Do you need my help?
No need.
You did well to have found this
They're all unoccupied pre-war premises
Photograph them before they're pulled down
It's deal for a horror atmosphere
So much the better.
Are you afraid?
Take care of your self!
Go up 2 more floors
What happened?
What happened?
That cat scared me, that's all

Calm down...
Stand up!
How dare you'?
Sir, I was pursued by a ghost!
Go back first
It works!
Great!
Fat Piao, take a photo Why so many men?
Is that case covered by you true?
Buy a news paper and you'll know
The police have seized all the news paper
They even claimed to sue you
Boss, what's your view?
The police operation is unreasonable
We've made faithful coverage
The police are obstructing news freedom
We won't submit, we'll take legal action
The Inspector's here
Why are the police calling an urgent press conference?
Is a vampire linked with the dancing Girl case?
What action will the police take?
Find an exorcist?
Ladies and gentlemen, go in.
I won't let you down
You'll reap what you've sown
I can sue you for blackmailing
Don't delight.
You'll see in a min.
Everybody's here, sir
Commence!
To save time, the press conference starts
Scoop:
Reporter Fighting Blood-Sucking Monster
Police Hiding Truth to Beguile Public
This is an absurd and irresponsible coverage
I've brought you all here to clarify this to avoid unnecessary speculation and unnecessary trouble
The police will take action against rumor mongers
Sorry
What have you got to accuse us?
Your coverage of blood-sucking is beguiling
According to Italian Anthropologists account in 1930, blood suckers have appeared in S. America
He was referring to witchcraft
They called them Resurrected Corpses
Inspector, can you elaborate?
Let me explain
They anesthetized the dying natives to make them look like dead, then unearthed to sell them as slaves
This is similar to corpse-walking in Hunan
They're not blood suckers as he suggested
I'll only stress the truth
What's that half-human half-ghost monster?
Silence!
Silence!
Silence, please!
A good question.
I'll answer right away
Blood Sucker, please come out!
Fat Piao, is that Blood Sucker?
Fatty!
Director, Director!
Wait, I still have a question to ask you
Piao?
Ming, have you seen Piao?
How do I know?
It's a girl!
Girl?
Let me take it
Who's that?
Would you leave a message?
Say that he's committed suicide
Suicide?
He won't do that
No?
Would he have face to see me?
He goes to bars when he's free
Whore-mongering!
Where?
Temple street...
A bar at no. 73, Tsimshatsui
Let me talk to her if you dare not
He's gone whore-mongering in Temple Street
What's so funny?
Well, have you got it?
Have one more drink first!
Thank you
Don't you know the Inspector's trying to frame us?
Those 2 girls come here everyday
All our men get it free from them
Why don't you try?
The black for me, the red for you
Why are you so elated?
Hello, miss
Why are you so late?
Better late than never
Are you interested?
Alone?
We m,ay kill you.
Have that Fatty join you
She really is open-minded
Fatty, come here!
Don't put on airs
Sit down
Sit down,Fatty, you've nothing to lose
Sit down, Fatty
Come here!
Let me introduce myself
I'm Banana
I'm Papaya
Brandy
You must be Whisky
No, I'm Wu Cha Pi
Cheers...
Cheers!
How many of you?
I'm looking for someone
Angie!
Fatty!
Angie, I'll take you home
No need.
Go on with your duty
Don't misunderstand
Those girls may be linked with that case
I want to check
I thought you'd given up
I'm reporter, I must clear my self
In fact, they can never rival you
I'm not as good as you thought
I'm married, with a 4-year-old daughter
The marriage was okay at the start
Then he changed, and we parted because, he sought only bodily consolation
Several years later, I met another man and thought I could settle down with him
until one morning when he disappeared with my jewelery
It's not too late to tum
It pays to have a ready-made-son
It's true!
I didn't lie
Idiot!
I was joking
Luckily I'm sensible enough
Thank you, father
Fat Piao, did you really see it?
Ever read of Christ and Satan in the Bible?
The body disappeared 2 days after burial
I reported to the police, but there's no news
Don't worry, we've been investigating
It's going to be alright, sir
Thank you
ls your mommy hard to get along with?
We've had no visitor's for 7 years
I'll come next time
Don't leave me in the church

Throw!
You know nothing but earning money from us
Mommy, mine is yours
A pity you don't have anything
Miss Lin, never trust a man
I never do Good!
Mommy, only a game.
Don't take it seriously
You're pushing me to desperation
It its real, I may have to kill myself
How narrow-minded women are
Right!
Right!
Play it yourself
We'll go to the room
Don't make fun of us
Just now you called me "male"
Angie, why are you pulling a long face
Why did you of-fend me?
I've been taking your side
Don't keep making your mommy angry
That's one way to cheer her up
It's me!
It's me!
Stop that for a change!
You scared me!
Nonsense, I have news
Angie, excuse me
You mean that corpse is the killer?
No idea
Have you got guts to check?
Fatty, you've never brought me anything good
That address, give me the lift
Take a taxi
Be careful!
Aren't you coming with me?
Why is your friend actling so sneakily?
He's trying to borrow money from me
Borrowing money?
Yes, he often came to do that
Go to bed.
Good night
Where to, miss?
Follow that car in front
Would there be trouble?
No.
That man's my husband
This road doesn't lead to Kowloontong
That one in front is it
Don't worry.
There's no girl inside
Probably a ghost
No need to find
Thank you
Taxi, wait!
Piao!
Piao!
Angie!
Piao, Piao!
Let me help you
No need I can still walk
Be careful!
Why have you come here?
I saw you moving sneakily
Does it hurt badly?
It's great
Hold it
Wait.
What if he's not a ghost?
Take it for my vengeance for the deceased
You'll become a murderer then
Watch out, Angie!
Come here, come here quick!
Go to hell!
Piao!

It works!
Angie, look.
It seems he's dead
Watch out!
A human voice!
Let's go and see!
Inspector, there seems someone on the roof
Who's up there?
Inspector, you're late We're here!
All police vans have flat tires.
We wont wait
They're all scum, sir.
Shall we continue?
No Yes, sir
Tell all men to retreat Yes, sir
Let's retreat
It's over!
What about the next move?
I have something in mind, but I must keep it confidential now
Fat Piao, why were you in that house?
I must know what happened
Tell me frankly
This is my private affair
This is not conducive to police public relations
Tell the Officers at once
Okay
Take his statement
The thought of it still scares me
It was... about 11:45 a.m.
More or less
I was driving my girlfriend home
I heard some strange sounds on the way
Click, click...
It ebbed when I slowed down and rose when I increased speed
Suddenly my car stopped.
It was pitch dark
Then a strong light flashed
Tow big eyes were staring at me
They were horrible and red with veins, gazing at me
I knew he wouldn't forgive me for trying to make fool of him
Don't delight!
Listen, if I read it in the paper, you'd be finished
I knew you'd flare up
Police public relations are not easy
Come on Angie, Let's go
I must leave, bye-bye Bye-bye
Hungry?
Can I make you noodles?
No need
I must return to avoid mommy's worries.
Bye
Bye-bye
What's so funny?
It was a such a pleasant and exciting memory
Exciting maybe, but not pleasant!
Yes, with your company
Would you care for a cup of coffee?
No, I don't drink coffee at night
It's too stimulating.
Bye-bye Bye-bye
Stop aside
Get out!
Put both hands on the door!
What's it, Pal?
Come out!
I'm a reporter
Hands on the door!
Crouch down
Don't move!
Open the trunk
I've an identity certificate
No more nonsense.
Open the trunk
Open it!
Open it quick!
Sir, this is no human blood
Someone can prove it for me No more nonsense.
Crouch down!
Don't move!
Why don't you listen to me?
Don't try anything!
Angie
Return to the police first
Policeman No. 12647 calling control
The program will start on 6th January
Hurry up!
Come here, sonny.
Lend me a hand
Answer the phone and you can make money
He must be mad
Who cares?
There are three of us
We can cope with one fatty
Don't be afraid!
Don't be afraid!
Go now
Okay!
Come here!
It's easy
Just say over the phone "The ghost's coming.
Go away!"
Remember that!
Fatty, how come?
Miss Li, what are you going to tell us?
Today's my birthday
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!
Let me tell you how I first met my husband
I'm still young
It takes so long.
We'd better leave
We can't, we've taken his money
Be serious. it's no fun
Someone's answering it!
Watch out!
A ghost's coming up for you
I'm serious!
Run quick!
Maniac!
Piao!
Angie, stay where you are!
Piao!
Piao!
I'm alright
Put down, Piao.
Now you can't laugh
Put it down, quick!
Angie, nail it with mahogany nail
Angie, mahogany nail!
Angie, careful!
Inspector, now I can laugh
Great!
No hurry!
Angie, easy...
Easy...
Good!
Great...
Good...
This one for the director
One full cup for you, Director
Cheers!
Let's have another bottle, okay?
No, director.
Its already past three
Never mind.
I'll make you the Chief Editor
This calls for a celebration!
Right'?
Champagne, miss!
Champagne, champagne!
Give me one more champagne
Good.You know them well?
No!
I've been here several times with the director
I don't like wine
Right, he came to feast his eyes only
Director, Director!
He said he can't move out after knowing you
You're drunk!
Shut up!
Every man moves around somehow
Right
Go out every night then
I do, but I don't fool around
You don't?
Fat Piao
Inspector, just in time for a drink
Don't be formal
We want to have a word with you
Please go there, if convenient
Yes
Miss Lin, please come together
Okay Well, go over...
Over there
Four Eyes Chen, smells of gun powder
That was only a maniac, not a ghost
A maniac a killer?
You can't hide it.
I'll publish it
I was present, I can prove it was a ghost
Miss, no one has ever proved the existence of ghost.
Have you got any proof?
Let's resort to legal means
Had Angie not nailed him, you'd have died
Nonsense, I shot him to death
You didn't?
What?
We can sue you for murder then
Murder?
Go ahead
At worst I close down to make the lawsuit
Director, not as simple as that
You may even land in jail
The blood-sucker, imposer case's still outstanding
I've lots of evidence against you
In fact, I've come to bring you the reward
I never imagined that
Don't try to buy me.
You can't
Sometimes it's better to keep secret
It's over.
Why alarm the public?
It won't do you any harm not to reveal it
Please take our advice.
Here's $100,000
Well, we don't mind keeping it a secret
We can change the caption to Oranky Chopper
It's equally attractive
Let's use it to redecorate the house
Good idea
Why are you so greedy?
I don't want you to suffer
Let's go out for a drink
Angie, what are you doing?
I did nothing
No?
Only a slight nudge Why take it seriously?
Fat Piao, let's forget the past I'm not trying to remember it
Don't fight anymore
Let bygones be bygones
Come on, cheers!
You really are generous
I was born like that
Don't be cocky
Not my fault now!
...she pushed me

"Oh dear, oh dear, I shall be late," said the White Rabbit.
"I shall be too late," sighed the White Rabbit.
Please, sir.
"Oh dear, how late it's getting," sighed the White Rabbit.
Sir?
Please?
"Oh dear, oh dear," muttered the White Rabbit.
"Oh, he'll have my head off," sighed the White Rabbit.
Sir, please!
Wait for me, sir.
"That's going too far," said Alice to herself.
"Oh, the Queen will be furious," muttered the White Rabbit.
Watch out, sir!
Wait for me, sir.
"Mary Anne, what are you doing here?
Run and bring me some new scissors,"
said the White Rabbit.
But I'm not Mary Anne.
"Don't argue.
Run along," ordered the White Rabbit, firmly.
"Oh dear, oh dear," muttered the White Rabbit to himself.
"Mary?
Mary?" the White Rabbit called.
"Mary Anne?
Mary Anne?"
"Mary, Mary, so where are those scissors?"
demanded the White Rabbit.
"Ow!
"Ow, ow, ow!" cried the White Rabbit.
"If I can't get in the door, then I'll go in through the window,"
said the White Rabbit.
"Now I'm certain to be late," complained the White Rabbit.
"Mind your step, Bill.
Go up the roof, Bill,"
chorused the animals.
"Bill, mind that loose slate.
"Do be careful, Bill," shouted the animals.
"Why, they seem to put everything on Bill," thought Alice to herself.
"Bill, go down the chimney," called the animals.
"I hope I haven't forgotten how to kick," said Alice to herself.
"There she is, after her!" called the animals.
"No more cakes or ink this time," thought Alice to herself.
"Who are you?" said the Caterpillar.
And who are you?
"Why?" asked the Caterpillar.
"Come back, I've something very important to tell you,"
demanded the Caterpillar.
"Keep your temper," said the Caterpillar.
Is that all?
"No," said the Caterpillar.
"One side will make you grow, the other side will make you shrink."
One side, the other side, of what?
"The mushroom," said the Caterpillar.
"Now leave me in peace to sleep,"
said the Caterpillar faintly.
"I think it worked quite well, though not entirely as I'd expected,"
thought Alice to herself.
Come in.
"An invitation for Alice from the Queen," said the Fish footman.
"An invitation from the Queen for Alice," repeated the Frog footman.
"Alice?
But that's me," Alice thought to herself.
Sir, please.
"No room, no room, no room!"
cried out the Mad Hatter and the March Hare.
"Why is a raven like a writing desk?" said the Mad Hatter.
"I want a clean cup, let's all move round one place,"
said the Mad Hatter.
"Have some wine," said the March Hare.
I don't see any wine.
"Because there isn't any!" said the March Hare.
"Your hair wants cutting," said the Mad Hatter.
"Oh dear, she'll have me beheaded!" sighed the White Rabbit.
Wait!
Please, sir!
"I want a clean cup.
Let's all move round one place,"
said the Hatter.
"What day is it today?" said the Hatter.
Thursday.
"Two days wrong again."
"I told you, butter would not suit the works,"
said the Mad Hatter.
"But it was the best butter," protested the March Hare.
"I want a clean cup,"
said the Mad Hatter.
"Well, why is a raven like a writing desk?" said the Mad Hatter.
"I want a clean cup,"
said the Mad Hatter.
"Your hair wants cutting," said the March Hare.
"Pour yourself a glass of wine," said the Mad Hatter.
"No room, no room, no room, no room, no room,"
cried the Mad Hatter and the March Hare.
"Oh dear, oh dear," muttered the White Rabbit.
Wait for me, please.
"Now off with their heads," said the Queen of Hearts.
"Off with their heads!" screamed the Queen.
"Can you play croquet?" said the Queen of Hearts.
Are you asking me?
"Yes," said the Queen of Hearts.
I do.
"Then come with me!" roared the Queen of Hearts.
"Would you please pick a flamingo?" ordered the Queen of Hearts.
"Off with their heads!" screamed the Queen.
"You are to learn this off by heart," said the White Rabbit.
Please wait for me.
"Let the accused step forward," said the King.
Do you mean me?
"Off with her head!" roared the Queen of Hearts.
"But, my dear, the sentence must come last,"
the King reminded the Queen.
"Why did you eat these here tarts?" said the King.
I...
But, but...
"Answer yes or no," said the King.
"Off with her head," screamed the Queen.
But I didn't eat anything.
Well, hardly anything.
"Give it here," ordered the King.
"Start reading here," said the King.
"I'm profoundly sorry for what I did."
"Your apology will be taken into account," said the King.
I'm not sorry for anything.
Well, hardly anything at all.
"Say what you're supposed to say.
You should have said,
"'I ask the court for the severest punishment,"' said the King wearily.
What do you take me for?
"Stick to the text or I'll have the court cleared,"
exclaimed the King.
But you can see, the tarts are all here.
Almost all of them.
"The evidence is not to be touched!" screamed the King.
"Off with her head!
Off with her head!"
screamed the Queen of Hearts.
"My dear, you're right as usual, of course.
"Off with her head!" ordered the King of Hearts.
"Off with her head!
"Which one?
Which one?"
"He's late as usual.
I think I'll cut his head off,"
thought Alice to herself.

... Alice thought for herself: now we will see a film done for children perhaps.
But you do not forget that you must close the eyes because otherwise you will not see anything.
Oh Dear!
Oh Dear!
I am going to be late!
- the white rabbit said.-
I am going to be late too much!
- the white rabbit said.-
Please, gentleman!

Wait me, gentleman!
Mary Ann, what you are doing here?
Bring me other scissors.
- the white rabbit said.-
This time not Mary Ann
I do not speak with you
Leave me alone.
- the white rabbit said at last.
Good heavens!
Repeated the white rabbit.
Mary, Mary!
- the White Rabbit shouted
Mary Ann!
Mary Ann!
Mary!
Mary!
Where is the scissor?
- the White Rabbit asked.-
- the white rabbit screamed.-
If I cannot enter from the door, I will enter from the window
- the white rabbit said.-
Now surely that I am late.
- the white rabbit said.-
Can you climb, Bill?
Climb to the ceiling Bill!
Poor animals.
Bill, look with that loose roofing tile!
Be careful, Bill.
Shut up animals
Why they put all responsibility on Bill?
- Alice thought by herself.-
Bill!
Low by the chimney.
- the animals shouted -
I hope not to have forgotten as a kick occurs.
- Alice said herself.-
There is she!
Catch her!
- the animals said.-
Nothing of treats this time!
- Alice thought for herself.-
Who are you?
- the caterpillar said.-
and... who are you?
Why?
- the caterpillar asked.-
Get in!
I have something important to say!
- the caterpillar said.-
Keep away from that badly genius!
- the caterpillar said.-
Is that all?
No!
- the caterpillar said.-
One side will let you grow, another side will make you shrink.
"One side... the other side... of what"
Of the fungus.
- the caterpillar said.-
Leave me alone now, so that I can sleep.
- the caterpillar said weakly.-
It works well...
But not as much as I hoped
- thought Alice at the same time.-
Enter... an invitation for Alice from Queen.
- the lacayo-fish said.-
an invitation from Queen, for Alice.
- the lacayo-toad repeated.-
Alice?
Alice?
But that one is me.
- said Alice at the same time.-
Sir, please.
There is no place!
There is no place!
- shouted the crazy hatter and March the rabbit.-
In what looks like a crow to a writing-desk?
- the hatter asked.-
I want a clean cup.
We are going to change the chair.
- the crazy hatter said.-
Want a little wine?
- March the rabbit said.-
I do not see any wine.
Because there is not!
- March the rabbit said.-
You need a haircut!
- the crazy hatter said.-
Oh dear, I will be decapitated!
- the white rabbit said.-
Wait!
Please, gentleman!
I want a clean cup.
We are going to change the chair.
- the hatter said.-
What is the day today?
- the hatter asked.-
Today is Thursday.
This clock has been 2 days of delay already.
I said that butter would not seat to him well.
- the hatter said.-
But it is the best butter.
-protested March the rabbit.-
I want a clean cup.
- the crazy hatter said.-
Well...
In what it looks like a crow to a writing-desk?
- asked Crazy hatter.-
I want a clean cup.
- the crazy hatter said.
You need a haircut.
- said March the rabbit.-
Serve you a glass of wine.
- crazy hatter said.-
There is no place!
There is no place!
- shouted the hatter crazy person and March the rabbit.-
Oh dear, oh dear.
- the white rabbit said.-
Wait me, please.
Cut the heads of them!
- Queen said to Hearts.-
Cut the heads of them!
- Queen said.-
You play croquet?
- Queen asked to Hearts.-
Asking to me?
Yes.
- Queen said to Corazones.-
Yes that game.
Then come with me.
- Queen said to Hearts.-
Please, catch a flamenco.
- Queen ordered to Hearts.-
Cut the heads of them!
- Queen shouted.
You must aprendértelo of memory.
- the white rabbit said.-
Please, wait me.
Stop coming near to the defendant.
- the King said.-
Talksing to me?
Cut the head of him!
- Queen said to Hearts.-
But affection... the first sentence...
- the King remembered to Queen.-
Why one ate present cakes here?
- the King asked.-
I...
I... answer yes or no!
- King said in serious tone.-
Cut the head of him!
- Queen shouted.-
I did not eat anything!
Or almost nothing... give me that.
- the King ordered.-
Begin to read from here.
- the King said.-
Hear much what I did...
Their excuses will be considered.
- the King said.-
But I do not regret anything!
Good, good... of almost nothing... tell us which assumes that it must say.
You should have said:
Ask to the Court the most severe punishment.
- the King with confidence said.-
Why they have brought to me?
Go by the text.
- the King said.
But see the cakes is all here!
All the cakes...
The tests cannot be touched!
- the King shouted.-
Cut the head of him!
- Queen of hearts shouted.-
Beloved, you are right, as always...
Is evident!
Cut the head of him!
- the King ordered to hearts.-
Cut the head of him!
Which of them...
Which of them...
Comes late, as always...
I believe that I will cut the head of him.
- Alice thought by herself.-
Life is like a hurricane
Here in Duckburg
Racecars, lasers, aeroplanes
It's a duck blur
Might solve a mystery
Or rewrite history
DuckTales Ooh-ooh
Every day they're out there making
DuckTales Ooh-ooh
Tales of derring-do bad and good luck tales
D-D-D-Danger!
Watch behind you
There's a stranger out to find you
What to do?
Just grab on to some DuckTales
Ooh-ooh
Every day they're out there making
DuckTales Ooh-ooh
Tales of derring-do bad and good luck tales
Ooh-ooh
Not ponytails or cottontails, no
DuckTales Ooh-ooh
Aah, there's nothing like a quiet evening at home.
Love is a many-feathered thing
And it's as sweet as the song I sing
What's going on here?
It's almost Valentine's Day, Uncle Scrooge.
- So we're making valentines.
- Or something like that.
Bah!
If you ask me, this Valentine's Day business is a waste of time and postage stamps.
Say, Huey, have you got any more glue?
No, but I think I know where we can find some.
Ah, come on.
There's nothing in that dusty old closet but mothballs.
Uh, hello, kids.
I was checking to see if any change fell out of my pockets.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
Hmm...
Ah, Uncle Scrooge, I thought you said valentines were a waste of stamps.
They are.
This old valentine was hand-delivered to me on a mountaintop back when my wallet was as skinny as my legs... back when I was a prospector in the days of the Great Klondike Gold Rush.
I don't know which was wilder in those days - the wolves or me.
And it was there that I met Glittering Goldie, the greediest gal in the Klondike.
I'm just a poor girl
Bashful and shy
Honest and truthful
I can't tell a lie
My needs are quite simple
They're modest and small
Just listen while I tell you all
Yeah
Don't care for diamonds, rubies or pearls
Don't care for fur coats like some other girls
Just give me the one thing that's easy to spend
Gold nuggets are my own friend
Yeah!
Gold nuggets are my truest friend
Mm, I love that sound.
Now, there's a gal with good sense.
Give me a mint soda, heavy on the mint and heavy on the soda.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't Scrounge McDuck.
Do I get my soda or not, Dangerous Dan?
How are you gonna pay for it - with gold dust or trail dust?
Now, I want drinks for everyone in the house who didn't laugh at me.
I'd never laugh at a duck with a gold nugget like this.
Care to join me and the boys for a friendly little card game, feather face?
Your nugget can join us, too.
That's enough for me.
That cleans me out.
Doggone it!
Shee-oot!
Don't mind if I do.
Well, Goldie, the only way you can win is with the ace of hearts.
Ooh!
What do you know?
This is my lucky day.
Too bad it isn't yours.
Well, knock me over with a twig.
Out of a whole deck of cards, what are the chances of Goldie getting... an ace of hearts?
An ace of hearts?
An ace of hearts?
Come back here, you little cheater!
Ooh!
You wanna dance?
I sure cooled him off, didn't I?
Ha-ha!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Huh?
- I'll trouble you for my gold nugget, ma'am.
- I haven't got it, sourdough.
Then I'll be forced to call the mounted police.
Wait.
Don't call the police.
I'll, uh, I'll dig you another gold nugget.
Ha!
With all due respect, ma'am, you wouldn't know how to earn an honest living if you tried.
Oh, yeah?
Just watch me.
Last one to your claim is a worthless nugget.
Where is your claim, anyway?
White Agony Creek.
Gold nuggets are my truest friend
Goldie turned out to be the hardest worker I ever knew.
Next to myself.
We worked my claim together through all kinds of weather.
I grew very fond of that gal.
When spring came, we had a big pile of gold... and even bigger plans for the future.
I'll meet you at the train station at midnight, partner.
I'll be there, partner.
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ee!
Duckburg, here we come!
Oh, Goldie, Goldie
Give me your answer due
I love nuggets
Almost as much as you
Curse me kilts!
We've been robbed!
Have you seen Goldie?
I've got to tell her - we've been robbed!
Why, Goldie skipped town.
Said she came into a stash of gold.
Wants to start a honky-tonk of her own.
And so I moved far, far away to Red Agony Creek, where I became a hermit and mined my fortune alone.
'Course, I never was as happy at Red Agony Creek as I was at White Agony.
Aw, you miss her, don't you, Uncle Scrooge?
Sometimes, Webby.
Do you still think there's gold at White Agony, Uncle Scrooge?
Could be, Dewey.
I only took a wee bit out of that claim.
Wait a minute.
It's still my claim.
Boys, back your bags.
We're going to the Klondike!
Yippee!
I'll show you the town, and we'll go to my claim.
And who knows?
We might even find Goldie!
Uh, gold.
Ah, lads, I can't wait to show you Dangerous Dan's Honky-tonk.
It's the wildest, rootin' tootin'-est on Earth!
Uh...
Where's all the rootin' and tootin', Uncle Scrooge?
Obviously, someplace else, kids.
Scrooge is back!
And I smell money.
No, I think it's my aftershave.
Ah, here we are, White Agony Creek, my old home, sweet home.
Well, knock me out with a raindrop.
Someone's living in my cabin, rent-free!
Egad!
Must be cutthroat claim-jumpers!
Lay low, lads.
I'll wait till nightfall to sneak up and disarm the rogues.
I know this place like the back of my head.
Now, don't get your fur up, you great brute.
This land you've been sleeping on belongs to me.
Let me show you around the place.
Ohh!
Climb a tree, Uncle Scrooge!
He's way too big to climb up after you!
Climb higher, Uncle Scrooge!
How in the world did my top hat get way up here?
Uh-oh.
Ye-ow!
Unfortunately, according to the Junior Woodchucks Guidebook, chapter 22, paragraph nine...
Bears can swim.
Whoa!
Hey!
That bear and that claim-jumper are friends with each other.
Well, they sure aren't friends with Uncle Scrooge.
Ohh...
Hmm.
Scrooge McDuck didn't come back to the Klondike for his health.
That's for sure.
There must still be gold on this old claim!
According to the Junior Woodchucks Guidebook, bears are attracted to honey.
As soon you see him coming, stop running, Uncle Scrooge.
Don't worry, lads.
Anything else I should know?
Yeah!
That bear's not wasting any time.
I sure hope this works.
Ah, don't worry, Louie.
The Junior Woodchucks bear-catching plan is foolproof.
Foolproof, yes.
Bear-proof, no!
There's only one way to stop that bear.
Come on!
Quackerooni!
You're a lady claim-jumper!
And darn proud of it.
What do you yahoos want?
Hey, lady, you gotta call off your bear before he eats Uncle Scrooge.
Scrooge?
As in Scrooge McDuck?
Uh-huh.
So, the no-good varmint is back.
Oh, I can't let him see me like this.
Holy smoke!
Why, you must be Glittering Goldie.
That's right.
And I can still glitter with the best of 'em.
Are you going to help Uncle Scrooge?
Nope.
I'm gonna try to get another shot at him.
Ah-whoo!
Start running, Scrooge McDuck.
I'll give you a sporting chance.
Why, Glittering Goldie.
You're the claim-jumper?
Had no place else to go when they closed up the town.
The gold in these parts ran out right after you left.
I left to forget, but a day hasn't gone by I haven't thought of you.
Oh, really?
You could always charm the quills off of a porcupine.
Oh, yuck!
He's holding hands with her.
Well, it's better than holding hands with that bear.
If you say so.
Remember how we planned to leave the Klondike together?
But you left with our gold instead of leaving with me.
I did not.
You left without me.
Only because you left without me.
I didn't steal your gold, you varmint!
Come out of there, you rat!
Hold your fire, Goldie, girl!
You just wounded about a million dollars in gold!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
She chased him over this hill.
There's only one thing I hate worse than holding hands with a girl - dancing with one.
We'll mine it together, just like the last time.
Aye.
And your share should be just enough to pay me back for what you took from me the last time.
- I didn't take that gold.
- Oh, come now, Goldie.
I'm not the young fool I used to be.
Nah.
Now you're just an old fool.
Well, I believe both of them.
Come one, Blackjack.
Let's go stay in town a while.
Are you sure she took your gold, Uncle Scrooge?
Come on, lads.
Nothing like hard work to clear the head.
We'll let them do all the work, but we'll be the ones spending Scrooge's gold.
Heard you were back in town, Goldie.
Dangerous Dan!
- Got any plans for tonight?
- Yep.
And as usual, they ain't gonna be with you!
Ah, come on, Goldie.
We'll take a little ride, shoot a little target-practice, rob a little train.
Scrooge is on that train.
Ohh!
Does that bother you?
Shoot.
He's a bigger knothead than you are.
And I want nothing to do with him or his gold.
Ah, she's not coming.
- Still in love with Scrooge, huh?
- Nah.
She hates him even worse than she hates me.
Ah!
You lucky guy.
- Hah!
- Hah!
Well, I guess I'll never see Goldie again.
It's safer that way, Uncle Scrooge.
Ahh.
But she sure was pretty.
Dangerous Dan!
Hey, watch out!
Whoa!
One of them's on the roof, Uncle Scrooge!
If they stop the train, we're done for.
Scrooge!
End of the line, pal.
It's not polite to point.
Let's dance.
Whoa!
I've been waiting a long time for this.
Huh?
I should have caught a different train.
Takes more than you to put me down, Dangerous Da...
Looks like I got the best of you again, Scrooge McDuck.
Again?
You've never got the best of me, Dangerous Dan!
Oh, yeah?
Years ago, I stole your last shipment of Klondike gold.
Then when you came looking for Goldie...
I made you think she did it!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Dangerous Dan, you're so low, you have to look up to see a snake.
I figure, now that I'm rich, maybe Glittering Goldie will be my valentine.
Maybe not.
Scrooge, are you all right?
I am now, lassie.
But for all these years, I've been all wrong.
The moon looks like a big gold nugget.
Oh, Scroogie-pooh, there is a romantic side to you.
Sure you won't come with me?
I'm sorry, Scrooge.
White Agony is my home now.
I understand.
There's something I want you to have.
Ooh.
A valentine.
No, Goldie.
Something better.
It's the deed to my claim and all the gold left in it.
You sure are something, Scrooge McDuck.
Oh, it's the least I can do, Goldie girl.
You didn't steal my gold, but I'm afraid you've stolen my heart.
(music) Thank you for being a friend
(music) Traveled down the road and back again
(music) Your heart is true
(music) You're a pal and a confidant
(music) And if you threw a party
(music) Invited everyone you knew
(music) You would see
(music) The biggest gift would be from me
(music) And the card attached would sat
(music) Thank you for being a friend (music)
Ma, if you didn't like the dress, you should have just told me.
I was trying to be helpful.
Asking if it came with a sign saying "Wide Load" is not being helpful.
I will never ever take you shopping with me again.
Fine, I'll shop at the mall by myself.
Then I'll be able to pee when I'm good and ready.
Dorothy, you found the dress for the banquet.
Oh, do you just adore it?
Does it stir emotions deep within you?
Could you just throw yourself down and die for it?
It's a dress, Blanche, it's not the Alamo.
It must be pretty special.
It took you five weeks to find it.
That's because I'm hard to fit.
I can see that, Dorothy, I'm not blind.
I didn't mean anything by that, honey.
Actually, I tend to fall between sizes myself.
Usually, I'm smack dab between a four...
And a 16.
- Hi, girls.
- [Dorothy] Hi, Rose.
Oh, Dorothy, is that your dress for the museum fundraiser?
- Uh-huh.
- Well, let's see it.
Oh, all right, but I warn you, it is very simple.
Well, what do you think?
I think... you're my best friend, so let's change the subject.
I think it's beautiful.
Exactly what I would have picked.
That settles it.
It goes back tomorrow.
What are you wearing, Blanche?
I'll probably grab some dazzling little number from my closet, that these people have not been privileged to see.
Maybe the red, sequined, strapless, backless, low-cut mini.
Why don't you just tie a scarf around your waist?
[Dorothy] Oh, Ma, good news.
They changed the flavor of Haley's MO.
- I'm taking the dress back.
- So?
So I'm sorry I lost my temper before.
And Ma,
I really would like you to go with me and help me pick out a dress.
What do you say?
What do I say?
I'm your mother, Dorothy.
I was there for you when you needed a communion dress.
I was there when you needed a prom dress.
[Sophia] I was there when you needed a wedding dress.
And frankly, I'm sick of it.
Buy your own damn dress.
I'll be over at Mildred's.
Rose Nylund?
No, if I start acting like her, pull the plug.
Rose Nylund.
Forty-three years and I'd know you anywhere.
Are you...
You're not...
Could you...
Buddy Rourke.
- Buddy Rourke!
- Yeah.
Oh, Blanche, Dorothy, it's Buddy Rourke.
Oh, come on in.
Buddy, these are my two best friends, Dorothy and Blanche.
- How do you do?
- Hi, there.
Buddy Rourke, after all these years.
You don't know who he is, do you, Rose?
Haven't a clue.
Please, don't be embarrassed.
We never met before.
Then how exactly would you have known her anywhere?
Charlie never stopped talking about her.
- You knew Charlie?
- Yeah.
- Please, sit down.
- I served with your husband in the war.
82nd Airborne.
Fort Bragg to Nottingham to Normandy and back, thank the Lord.
Charlie Nylund was one of the finest men I ever met.
[Buddy] I often wonder why he put up with a wise guy like me, from the backstreets of Boston.
I'm sorry I didn't know who you were, but Charlie didn't talk about the war.
I always hoped Charlie and I would hook up again one day.
But, uh, well, believe it or not,
I never had the occasion to visit St. Olaf.
Really?
You mean, not even to change planes for St. Gustav?
Oh, you can't get to St. Gustav by plane, Dorothy.
You have to go by toboggan.
Course, traveling in the summer is really rough on the old heinie.
It's a great way to rack up lots of frequent tobogganer mileage.
This is just amazing.
How did you ever find Rose after all this time?
I got Rose's address from Charlie's army pension records.
And I realized a lifetime had passed and I never laid eyes on my old chum's favorite girl.
So, I made myself a promise.
If I was ever in the area,
- I'd pay my respects.
- Would you stay for dinner?
I'm making sweet and sour smelt kabobs.
Smelt kabobs.
Oh, darn, I had them for lunch.
Me too.
They served them on the plane.
And I'm awfully tired after the trip, but I was hoping that, uh, you might let me invite you to lunch tomorrow.
- That is, if you're free.
- Oh, that'd be wonderful.
And if you have time, I'd like to show you around Miami.
- I'll pick you up around noon.
- Great.
Ladies, it's been a pleasure meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.
- Likewise.
Rose, you're every bit as lovely as the picture Charlie used to carry.
[Buddy] See you tomorrow.
- What a sweet man.
- Absolutely charming.
And he obviously idolized your Charlie.
And more importantly, he wasn't wearing a wedding ring.
Oh, Blanche, don't be silly.
I merely checked it out and I noticed him giving me the eye.
Blanche, have you ever met a man you didn't think was giving you the eye?
Once, in 1976.
But it was only two days later that Mr. President Jimmy Carter announced to the American people he had secretly lusted in his heart.
[Rose] You can't be serious.
Charlie read you every one of my letters?
Selected passages.
He selfishly kept the more intimate sections to himself.
One, please.
I used to write him every Sunday, after church.
That way I'd have all the latest gossip around town.
No, he read me the gossip.
In fact, and I remember there was some kind of a scandal.
Uh, with a neighbor, I think.
Uh, the name was, uh, let's see.
Oh, thank you.
Phineas Wigley?
I can't believe you remember that.
Well, in all fairness, Phineas Wigley is a hard name to forget.
Oh, I know what you mean.
The Wigleys were a revered family.
Yeah, until the scandal.
Oh, it was just terrible.
The Navy came to town to take bids for a big submarine contract.
[Rose] They said they wanted three submarines built for a million.
Well, Finneas said he could make 100 for half the money.
So, of course, he got the contract.
[Rose] When the Navy came to check on the progress, six months later, they discovered there'd been a misunderstanding.
Finneas had made 100 hoagie heroes for $500,000.
He claimed the reason they were so expensive was he used all imported meats and cheeses.
You know, that story still tickles me.
Just as much as the first time Charlie told it to me.
It just amazes me, how much you know about my life with Charlie.
Rose I don't think you realize how very much you meant to him.
Or... how very much you meant to me.
To you?
I don't understand.
I didn't have a wife or a sweetheart back home.
And when Charlie would read me your letters,
I felt like...
Well, that someone cared.
And that meant a lot to me.
[Buddy] I spent a long time searching for someone exactly like Rose Nylund.
I never found her.
And now I know why.
There's no one exactly like Rose Nylund.
- Oh, Buddy.
- Charlie carried those letters in his jacket through the war.
I carried them in my heart for a lifetime.
And I think I fell in love with the woman who wrote them.
Dorothy, you gonna show me the dress or not?
- [Dorothy] Be right there.
- Get a move on.
If you hurry up, I can give you an honest unbiased opinion.
You'll still have time to return it before the mall closes tonight.
- Well, Ma, what do you think?
- Pussycat,
- you look sensational.
- You really think so, Ma?
I really think so.
I've never seen you look so beautiful.
- Thanks, Ma.
- Who's the designer?
He deserves a Nobel Prize for miracles.
Why do I even ask you?
I'm your mother, I'm gonna tell you whether you ask me or not.
By the way, the sleeves are too long.
- I'll ask Rose to shorten them.
- If you can find her.
Ever since that guy hit town, she spends most of her time polishing his shillaly.
Ma, Rose and Buddy are just friends.
Sure, and Michael Jackson was born with that cleft in his chin.
[Blanche] Girls!
Just wait until you see the little number I picked up for the museum banquet.
Here I come!
- I don't believe it.
- [Stammering] It can't be.
Don't panic.
Pick up one for Rose, you can go as the Pointer Sisters.
You were going to wear something out of your closet.
Well, I was.
But as it turned out, nothing fit me.
What did you expect, Blanche?
Last weekend, you ate so many pudding pops, you could have built the Eiffel Tower from the sticks.
That is not what I meant.
I meant everything just hangs on me.
Of course.
That's why you have to cover it with a dress.
All right, Dorothy, what are we gonna do about this?
We are not going to do anything.
Blanche, it has taken me a whole month to find this dress, you are simply going to have to take yours back.
Dorothy, be reasonable.
This dress looks so much better on me than it does on you.
Hi, girls.
I love your dress.
- I am not taking mine back.
- I am not taking mine back.
Girls, I really need to talk to you.
This is crazy.
Since when do you care how you look?
I think it started when I came down from the bell tower and had my hump fixed.
Buddy's going back to Boston on Saturday.
This dress looks sensational on me.
People expect to see me in a sensational dress.
What do they expect to see me in, a yarmulke and a Hefty bag?
He wants me to go with him.
To live with him.
And I think I might.
Rose, honey, you can't be serious.
- [Rose] Why not?
- You hardly know the man.
I feel like I've known him all my life.
I talk to him about Charlie, I talk to him about St. Olaf,
I talk to him about my family, my animal friends,
I talk to him about life on the farm...
If that man didn't get a medal in the war, he deserves one now.
[Sophia] Wait a minute!
Did she just say "live with him"?
That's right, Sophia.
Not marry him, live with him.
[All] Yes.
Two World Wars, a Polish pope and now this.
I may live to see CBS come up with a morning show yet.
I just don't know what to do.
Well, frankly, Rose, I think you're just rushing things.
But, I don't know.
Maybe it's better to live with Buddy than to just charge full steam ahead and marry him.
No, it isn't.
This is morally wrong.
It is epically offensive.
It's an out and out sin.
Why do I feel like I just fell through the looking glass?
Blanche, how can you, of all people, say something like that?
Well, Rose Nylund, I have never lived with a man without the benefit of marriage.
Excuse me, Blanche, I think what you mean is you have never lived with a man without benefit of room service.
Being with a man is not the same thing as living with a man.
You're right, Blanche.
Living with a man eliminates the need for an overnight bag and a stop at the drugstore.
And the need for marriage.
Family and tradition.
Not to mention wedding showers, catered affairs, the bridal registry at Burdines.
Well, I know what you mean, Blanche, but there's another side to this.
If I had lived with Stan before we got married
I could have spared us both some very painful times.
And a bitter divorce.
And possibly given birth to reasonably attractive children.
It does seem like the right thing to do.
I'm comfortable with Buddy.
Everything seems so natural.
It's easier being with him because he already knows
- so much about me.
- Yeah, but Rose,
- do you love him?
- I... think so.
- What about money?
- Everyone loves money.
Oh, I mean, have you talked about financial arrangements?
If you were married, you could have a prenuptial agreement.
But just living together, all you can do is steal money out of his wallet while he's in the shower.
We've agreed to keep our finances separate.
- He insisted on it.
- That's good, at least.
He suggested that since we'll need a bigger place to live,
I should give him my half of the money now before I get there.
So that it'll be our place, not his, right from the start.
Sounds like you've made up your mind.
I guess I have.
Oh, but I feel awful about leaving you guys.
I feel like I'm breaking up the Three Musketeers.
Honey, you go with your heart.
We just want you to be happy.
I am happy.
And I want you to be happy.
That's why I want you to settle this dress business.
Oh!
There is nothing to settle.
Now, I am wearing this dress.
Dorothy!
It deserves to be displayed on a devastatingly beautiful body.
Who are you gonna send it to, Kim Basinger?
What is that supposed to mean?
Why don't you think about it while inhaling your next cheese cake.
How dare she imply that I overeat.
Makes me so mad!
Oh, darn.
We're out of Chips Ahoy.
I'm gonna get out of this girdle and go down to the market for some cookies and bean dip.
Oh, hell, I'll just take the damn thing off in the car.
Oh, Blanche, I'm glad you're here.
I have something to tell you.
- What are you holding?
- A new gown.
Oh, no!
I wanted to be the nice one.
I bought a new dress too.
[Laughs]
Mr. Marty's?
On Market Street?
Where every dress is a guaranteed one of a kind original?
If we have the same dress, Mr. Marty's gonna be left with one of a kind.
Oh, thank goodness!
Everything's all right.
Except for what I have to tell you.
It wasn't about the dress?
It was about Rose and Buddy.
That business of giving him money has been bothering me.
So I've decided to do some checking on Buddy Rourke.
And after a couple of phone calls I found out he had just retired after 45 years in the records department of the Army Pension Office.
I don't get it.
That's how he knew about Charlie.
They never served together.
He just read his file.
But he knew all those things about Rose.
He knew that she came from St. Olaf.
I mean, everything else, Rose probably volunteered.
You know her, a stranger says hello, and suddenly he's hearing the life story of Uncle Fingerbinger and his 30-pound rutabaga.
Then this is all just a scam to bilk Rose out of some money?
Absolutely, and it is not the first time he's tried it.
Where is Rose?
I mean, we have to tell her.
Dorothy, she said she had to go to the bank and then go to meet Buddy.
What are we gonna do?
There's nothing we can do.
Wait until she gets home.
- Oh, good Lord.
- [Sophia] Hey, girls.
How do you like this spiffy little number I picked up?
Sophia, that's the same dress I got.
Well, now you know how it should look.
[Rose] I wrote the kids about you.
- [Buddy] Really?
- Oh, not about us.
About you.
About how you knew their father.
- They found it unbelievable.
- What do you mean?
Well, that you and I finally met.
Oh, I thought you meant they wouldn't believe there were any dinosaurs still around
- from World War II.
- Speaking of dinosaurs, did Charlie ever tell you about how they found the dinosaur bones right outside St. Olaf?
- Rose...
- Karl Nickerson was teaching his German shepherd to bury a herring bone.
- Karl was...
- Rose!
You haven't even mentioned about moving to Boston.
Are you avoiding the subject?
- I can't go with you, Buddy.
- But, Rose...
It wouldn't be fair.
I've given it a lot of thought and I realize,
I'm not being honest with you.
- Or with myself.
- Rose, how could this be?
- We've been so happy.
- Oh, I am happy.
Happy with the memories of Charlie that you rekindled.
Oh!
Sometimes I put those memories too far away because I'm afraid they'll be painful.
It's the hardest on holidays or when I'm lying in bed, alone at night.
But remembering Charlie with you is wonderful.
I'm glad I met you, Buddy.
But I don't love you.
[Rose] I...
I'm sorry.
Listen, I went to the bank and I got something for you.
- It's a gold watch.
- It's Charlie's gold watch.
I want you to have it.
But this is a very expensive piece of jewelry.
Please, Buddy.
I think I've taken enough from you and Charlie already.
- What?
- Listen, I hate emotional scenes.
I'm the only Irishman in Boston who avoids wakes and political rallies.
So, I'm just gonna run, you understand?
- But Buddy...
- I'll write.
I will.
No, I won't.
I always say that.
I never do.
You take care of yourself, Rose.
You're a special lady.
[Opera plays]
[Dorothy knocking] Ma?
- Ma, I need to talk to someone.
- Sure, come in.
I can hear Pavarotti live from the Met anytime.
[Sophia] What's the problem?
Ma, I'm upset about Rose.
Me too.
I thought I was finally gonna get a room with some sunlight.
I'm upset because we haven't told her the truth about Buddy.
Everything turned out all right.
She gave him the brush off, she didn't give him any money,
- he didn't even take the watch.
- I know.
But we're letting her live with a lie.
So, a little lie gave her a lot of pleasure.
- What harm does that do?
- Oh, I don't know.
- Then what's the problem?
- It doesn't seem right.
Dorothy, let me tell you a story.
Picture it.
Sicily, 1922.
A young military officer stationed far from home.
He wanders the streets seeking a friendly face and a glass of Chianti.
Finally, he happens into a dusty little cafe where he finds both.
The man laughs for the first time in months.
And finds inspiration in a beautiful peasant girl, wise beyond her years.
When the cafe is closed, she takes him home with her.
Three glorious days, they make love and drink wine.
He returns to his command prepared to lead his people through whatever battles need to be fought.
Dorothy, that young peasant girl was me.
And that young man was Winston Churchill.
Ma, you made that whole thing up, now what is your point?
That I made it up.
It was a little lie that gave me a lot of pleasure.
If Rose is happy, and there was no harm done, let her have that.
You know something, Ma...
You may be right.
[Turns on opera music]
Good night, Charlie.
I love you.

Well, I was.
But as it turned out, nothing fit me.
What did you expect, Blanche?
Last weekend, you ate so many pudding pops, you could have built the Eiffel Tower from the sticks.
That is not what I meant.
I meant everything just hangs on me.
Of course.
That's why you have to cover it with a dress.
All right, Dorothy, what are we gonna do about this?
We are not going to do anything.
Blanche, it has taken me a whole month to find this dress, you are simply going to have to take yours back.
Dorothy, be reasonable.
This dress looks so much better on me than it does on you.
Hi, girls.
I love your dress.
- I am not taking mine back.
- I am not taking mine back.
Girls, I really need to talk to you.
This is crazy.
Since when do you care how you look?
I think it started when I came down from the bell tower and had my hump fixed.
Buddy's going back to Boston on Saturday.
This dress looks sensational on me.
People expect to see me in a sensational dress.
What do they expect to see me in, a yarmulke and a Hefty bag?
He wants me to go with him.
To live with him.
And I think I might.
Rose, honey, you can't be serious.
- [Rose] Why not?
- You hardly know the man.
I feel like I've known him all my life.
I talk to him about Charlie, I talk to him about St. Olaf,
I talk to him about my family, my animal friends,
I talk to him about life on the farm...
If that man didn't get a medal in the war, he deserves one now.
[Sophia] Wait a minute!
Did she just say "live with him"?
That's right, Sophia.
Not marry him, live with him.
[All] Yes.
Two World Wars, a Polish pope and now this.
I may live to see CBS come up with a morning show yet.
I just don't know what to do.
Well, frankly, Rose, I think you're just rushing things.
But, I don't know.
Maybe it's better to live with Buddy than to just charge full steam ahead and marry him.
No, it isn't.
This is morally wrong.
It is epically offensive.
It's an out and out sin.
Why do I feel like I just fell through the looking glass?
Blanche, how can you, of all people, say something like that?
Well, Rose Nylund, I have never lived with a man without the benefit of marriage.
Excuse me, Blanche, I think what you mean is you have never lived with a man without benefit of room service.
Being with a man is not the same thing as living with a man.
You're right, Blanche.
Living with a man eliminates the need for an overnight bag and a stop at the drugstore.
And the need for marriage.
Family and tradition.
Not to mention wedding showers, catered affairs, the bridal registry at Burdines.
Well, I know what you mean, Blanche, but there's another side to this.
If I had lived with Stan before we got married
I could have spared us both some very painful times.
And a bitter divorce.
And possibly given birth to reasonably attractive children.
It does seem like the right thing to do.
I'm comfortable with Buddy.
Everything seems so natural.
It's easier being with him because he already knows
- so much about me.
- Yeah, but Rose,
- do you love him?
- I... think so.
- What about money?
- Everyone loves money.
Oh, I mean, have you talked about financial arrangements?
If you were married, you could have a prenuptial agreement.
But just living together, all you can do is steal money out of his wallet while he's in the shower.
We've agreed to keep our finances separate.
- He insisted on it.
- That's good, at least.
He suggested that since we'll need a bigger place to live,
I should give him my half of the money now before I get there.
So that it'll be our place, not his, right from the start.
Sounds like you've made up your mind.
I guess I have.
Oh, but I feel awful about leaving you guys.
I feel like I'm breaking up the Three Musketeers.
Honey, you go with your heart.
We just want you to be happy.
I am happy.
And I want you to be happy.
That's why I want you to settle this dress business.
Oh!
There is nothing to settle.
Now, I am wearing this dress.
Dorothy!
It deserves to be displayed on a devastatingly beautiful body.
Who are you gonna send it to, Kim Basinger?
What is that supposed to mean?
Why don't you think about it while inhaling your next cheese cake.
How dare she imply that I overeat.
Makes me so mad!
Oh, darn.
We're out of Chips Ahoy.
I'm gonna get out of this girdle and go down to the market for some cookies and bean dip.
Oh, hell, I'll just take the damn thing off in the car.
Oh, Blanche, I'm glad you're here.
I have something to tell you.
- What are you holding?
- A new gown.
Oh, no!
I wanted to be the nice one.
I bought a new dress too.
[Laughs]
Mr. Marty's?
On Market Street?
Where every dress is a guaranteed one of a kind original?
If we have the same dress, Mr. Marty's gonna be left with one of a kind.
Oh, thank goodness!
Everything's all right.
Except for what I have to tell you.
It wasn't about the dress?
It was about Rose and Buddy.
That business of giving him money has been bothering me.
So I've decided to do some checking on Buddy Rourke.
And after a couple of phone calls I found out he had just retired after 45 years in the records department of the Army Pension Office.
I don't get it.
That's how he knew about Charlie.
They never served together.
He just read his file.
But he knew all those things about Rose.
He knew that she came from St. Olaf.
I mean, everything else, Rose probably volunteered.
You know her, a stranger says hello, and suddenly he's hearing the life story of Uncle Fingerbinger and his 30-pound rutabaga.
Then this is all just a scam to bilk Rose out of some money?
Absolutely, and it is not the first time he's tried it.
Where is Rose?
I mean, we have to tell her.
Dorothy, she said she had to go to the bank and then go to meet Buddy.
What are we gonna do?
There's nothing we can do.
Wait until she gets home.
- Oh, good Lord.
- [Sophia] Hey, girls.
How do you like this spiffy little number I picked up?
Sophia, that's the same dress I got.
Well, now you know how it should look.
[Rose] I wrote the kids about you.
- [Buddy] Really?
- Oh, not about us.
About you.
About how you knew their father.
- They found it unbelievable.
- What do you mean?
Well, that you and I finally met.
Oh, I thought you meant they wouldn't believe there were any dinosaurs still around
- from World War II.
- Speaking of dinosaurs, did Charlie ever tell you about how they found the dinosaur bones right outside St. Olaf?
- Rose...
- Karl Nickerson was teaching his German shepherd to bury a herring bone.
- Karl was...
- Rose!
You haven't even mentioned about moving to Boston.
Are you avoiding the subject?
- I can't go with you, Buddy.
- But, Rose...
It wouldn't be fair.
I've given it a lot of thought and I realize,
I'm not being honest with you.
- Or with myself.
- Rose, how could this be?
- We've been so happy.
- Oh, I am happy.
Happy with the memories of Charlie that you rekindled.
Oh!
Sometimes I put those memories too far away because I'm afraid they'll be painful.
It's the hardest on holidays or when I'm lying in bed, alone at night.
But remembering Charlie with you is wonderful.
I'm glad I met you, Buddy.
But I don't love you.
[Rose] I...
I'm sorry.
Listen, I went to the bank and I got something for you.
- It's a gold watch.
- It's Charlie's gold watch.
I want you to have it.
But this is a very expensive piece of jewelry.
Please, Buddy.
I think I've taken enough from you and Charlie already.
- What?
- Listen, I hate emotional scenes.
I'm the only Irishman in Boston who avoids wakes and political rallies.
So, I'm just gonna run, you understand?
- But Buddy...
- I'll write.
I will.
No, I won't.
I always say that.
I never do.
You take care of yourself, Rose.
You're a special lady.
[Opera plays]
[Dorothy knocking] Ma?
- Ma, I need to talk to someone.
- Sure, come in.
I can hear Pavarotti live from the Met anytime.
[Sophia] What's the problem?
Ma, I'm upset about Rose.
Me too.
I thought I was finally gonna get a room with some sunlight.
I'm upset because we haven't told her the truth about Buddy.
Everything turned out all right.
She gave him the brush off, she didn't give him any money,
- he didn't even take the watch.
- I know.
But we're letting her live with a lie.
So, a little lie gave her a lot of pleasure.
- What harm does that do?
- Oh, I don't know.
- Then what's the problem?
- It doesn't seem right.
Dorothy, let me tell you a story.
Picture it.
Sicily, 1922.
A young military officer stationed far from home.
He wanders the streets seeking a friendly face and a glass of Chianti.
Finally, he happens into a dusty little cafe where he finds both.
The man laughs for the first time in months.
And finds inspiration in a beautiful peasant girl, wise beyond her years.
When the cafe is closed, she takes him home with her.
Three glorious days, they make love and drink wine.
He returns to his command prepared to lead his people through whatever battles need to be fought.
Dorothy, that young peasant girl was me.
And that young man was Winston Churchill.
Ma, you made that whole thing up, now what is your point?
That I made it up.
It was a little lie that gave me a lot of pleasure.
If Rose is happy, and there was no harm done, let her have that.
You know something, Ma...
You may be right.
[Turns on opera music]
Good night, Charlie.
I love you.
[Tubbs On Speaker] Yeah, I could go for galletas, chicharones, malta.
No, no.
Get me guayaba con galletas.
Man, that's a little over the top, Rico.
[Laughs] You wanna just stop and eat?
Why not?
'Cause if you bring crackers in here, you're not gonna be able to get those crackers out of the carpet.
[Laughs] There are more important things to worry about.
Let other people worry about, uh, gettin' crackers out of the carpet.
Oye, Paco.
Stop by the first bodega you see.
You don't get the point, huh?
I get it.
No, no, no, no, no.
It's the details.
The tiny details.
You take care of those, big things take care of themselves.
Hey, Paco, hand me the buster.
Buster?
[Loud Whirring]
[Man On Speaker] Now, tell me.
Tell me if you can't eat off of that rug.
Go ahead.
[Laughing]
What can I say?
What can I say?
The man is a dummy, you know?
Be a miracle if he can remember the cigarettes, the guayaba con galletas and the nose spray.
Now, how can I trust him to keep dope off of the floor?
Huh?
It's a tough life, huh, pal?
- Man, I'm humiliated.
- What you talkin' about, man?
He's always got cash.
Look, I can take this with pride.
The door.
Close the door.
Hurry.
Party time, Mr. Limousine.
Your money.
You got an exemption?
Your cash!
All right.
- I'll take that.
- There's nothing in the case.
Something for you in there.
The armrest compartment.
Here?
Yeah.
Here's the lights, man.
Okay, I'll take the case now.
- Be satisfied with the 20 grand.
- I'll kill you!
Okay.
Take the case.
[Man On Earpiece] Come on, your guns.
Hurry up.
I'm not packin', man.
I'm not packin'.
Okay, get out of here.
Open the door!
[Tires Screeching] What are you, crazy?
Stupid!
[Spits]
¡Oye, Pacol ¡Pacol
You're dead!
You hear me?
Dead!
Get in the car!
I'm gonna kill 'em.
I'm gonna kill 'em forever.
[Engine Starts]
?
[Whistling]
The key to this guy is in that briefcase.
He turned green when they took it.
He called it his business.
He acted like they took the whole building or something.
What else do we have on him?
He's got an obsession for details.
He likes to do his own vacuuming.
All right, so we got a major crack manufacturer... gives up 20K in cash happily... and considers dying for a briefcase.
What's in it?
Maybe business details, manufacturing plans.
More like a distribution chain or a list of wholesalers.
So he'll be lookin' for it as hard as we will.
Get to it first.
Keep me posted.
All right, gang, what have we got?
We got a couple of guys who make up to look exactly alike.
They hit a limo, only the guy is a major crack dealer.
Brown shorts for your average mugger.
These guys do it like trick-or-treat.
So what does that tell ya?
It's crazy.
Yeah, I'd say.
Wait a minute.
There can only be so many places in this town that have professional makeup.
[Bells Dinging]
Look at this place.
[Screaming] [Laughing]
Come on!
That's not funny!
Do you want me to shoot it?
[Laughing Continues] Oh, that's not funny.
[Laughs] Look, don't worry about Ricky Lee.
I fed him earlier.
Oh, yeah?
My name's Ochborg.
What can I do for you?
Uh, um, Officer Calabrese.
Oh, you're the lady that called earlier about my list.
No, I'm the lady that called.
You're the lady that called about my customer list.
You know, I'm the only place in all of Miami that sells the kind of makeup you described on the phone.
Yeah.
So?
So, uh, I have a list.
Would you like to see it?
Yeah.
Great.
There it is.
Oh, great.
[Laughing]
Oh, fool.
[Laughing]
You.
Oh, boy.
Wait a minute.
This is, uh, all of Florida.
You think you could narrow it down a bit— like, uh, Coconut Grove?
Oh, oh, sure.
Um, come here.
Uh—
No, no, no, no.
I'm not gonna do any more jokes.
It's on Palmetto Drive.
Biscayne Epicure and Dinner Theater.
We gonna eat or see a movie?
It's a dinner theater.
They do plays.
Oh.
We're gonna eat and see a play.
Mm-hmm.
You're gonna go see a play.
That's why Ruiz and his friends are with us, you know?
Didn't you know?
They're the new theater critics for the Miami Sun.
[Laughs] Congratulations, Ruiz.
I didn't know he could write.
No?
[Laughs]
The men who took my case were wearing theatrical makeup.
If I don't get that case back, you're out of a job, buddy.
Rainer Werner Fassbinder, who was a German filmmaker, got so jacked up that his heart gagged.
Before that he said, "Film is the language of the illiterate."
Right idea.
Wrong medium.
You see, film belongs to the dilettante children of millionaires.
Theater is the language of the illiterate.
This is the first chance you get at social expression that won't land yourself in the joint.
That, homeboys, is a feeling you ain't had before.
Okay, let's go.
Let's get that board set up.
[Whistles]
[Chattering]
Hey, Crockett.
So what about it, Mikey?
What is it?
You got a death wish or something?
Hey, not me, man.
I'm rehabilitated.
Welcome to the ex-con theater of life, a place to come through, you know, when you get cut loose.
Work out the stress, understand yourself.
Mm-hmm.
Well, maybe you want to make me understand why a smart guy like you... would want to do something crazy like ripping off Don Gallego.
Life's a puzzle.
[Laughs]
I thought it was a stage.
[Laughing]
I'm gonna need that attaché case.
You ought to come down off the ceiling, man.
No games, Mike.
You got a warrant, Crockett?
I know this guy.
I busted him three times in the last five years.
I've got the warrant.
?
[Whistling]
[Chattering]
That guy with the white socks and slippers on fits the description, but I wouldn't swear to it.
You want a warrant, Mikey?
Come on, man.
Make it easy on us.
We just want the case and what's inside it.
If there's any money in it, I don't give a damn.
You can have it.
I just need the information in the case.
Your friend's hallucinating.
Mikeyl I know you took it.
I know you did.
And if Don Gallego finds you out, he's gonna kill you.
Why don't you wake up, Crockett?
I don't know any Gallego.
I ain't seen no case.
I ain't been in no limo.
And I could care less about your problems.
I got my own.
What limo?
Did I say limo?
You're under arrest, buddy.
Mikey.
Sometimes you are such a chump.
Wait!
You can't do that!
[Tubbs] Back off, chumpl You can't do it.
Back off!
Wait.
Wait.
You can't do that.
Come on.
Leave him alone, man!
They're gonna keep him in!
Leave him alone!
All right, Mikey, get up there.
You know the drill.
Yeah, squawk or walk!
That's the game.
He's my brother!
Leave him alone!
Mmm, leather.
Mikey, cool it, man.
Leave him alone.
Come on.
Hey, that's a good way to lose some teeth!
Hey!
Get outta there!
Get over here.
Come on, man.
Hey, they're gonna— They're gonna keep him this time.
You just couldn't leave it alone.
There was an easy way to do this, chump.
He don't do things the easy way.
Neither does he.
So I misread you.
We're gonna search this, boys.
Make it easy.
Here on the streets you give me the speech about freedom.
About the future, promise and gain.
It goes to the ear, ringing' of fear.
What falls on my body is pain.
To maintain my frail form, to weather the storm,
I respond to your babble in manifest rabble.
Ajunkie, a thief, a mugger I've been.
Committed every known sin.
I murdered.
I raped.
I maimed.
I told you what to do with my shamel
You say this gives you the right to my life!
But what I've got to give up is existing in strife!
You throw me away, forget that I've beenl
But you nurture my seed, and I will come back... again, again, againi
Again!
Again!
Again!
Again!
Come on, Mikey.
Again!
Again!
Again!
[Indistinct]
If he hid the briefcase here, we're not gonna find it.
I hear that.
Damn.
We're gonna need a unit to shake this place down.
Hmm.
Forget that I've been!
But I'll come back!
You nurture my seed!
But I'll come back!
Come on.
Again!
Again!
Again!
Again!
Again!
Again!
Again!
The man's got snakes in his head.
And Gallego on his tail.
So what is it, Mikey?
Hmm.
You get tired of the good life?
You don't know my life, man.
You've won every major theater award.
Three years ago, you were earning $20,000 a month.
Yeah, well, I make that much in one night now.
Is it gonna make a difference— like with this guy gone, there's no more crack?
This guy kills kids.
Everybody dies.
[Sighs]
I'm putting Switek undercover at the theater.
I want you and Crockett back on Gallego.
Yeah, replace that gel, and then that light just a hair over.
Just switch it over a hair.
Right.
Right.
Okay, now bring it—
Excuse me.
Yo, what do you want?
Hold tight a second.
I got out of Kansas State on an early release.
My dad died, and I'm here to work off some stress.
Oh, look, man.
We can barely keep it together for ourselves.
Well, if that's the problem, uh, I got a couple of bucks I can kick in for food.
Welcome to Mi Vida Loca, partner.
Thank you very much.
[Hammer Cocks]
Hey, these must be the lights I'm paying for.
Gentlemen.
I... have been robbed... by two men... wearing makeup.
These men took a case... necessary... to my business.
So I hope... that you understand when I say... that if I don't get this case back within 24 hours,
I will kill the men who took it.
What's your name?
Con— Conejo.
Are you one of these men?
Shh.
[Muttering]
Don't lie, okay?
You don't have to lie.
You know why?
'Cause I'm gonna give you three hours.
And if I don't get that case back by tonight,
I'm gonna kill you.
Tonight.
Well, this oughta give Mikey plenty to write about.
[Sighs]
If Mikey doesn't get killed first.
[Phone Rings]
Yeah, it's Tubbs.
Yeah?
Who?
Damn!
What is it?
Mikey just posted bail.
Oh, man.
Thanks.
[Handset Settles In Cradle] Who was it?
One of Gallego's men?
No, his agent.
You're so fine to me, Marty.
Oh, wake up, Mikey.
The party's over.
Party's never over.
It's over.
You have an autobiography due in six weeks.
You written a word yet?
It'll come to me.
It's an autobiography, Mikey!
It's already come to you, and gone, just like the advance.
Now, you have to give him one thing or the other.
Hey, man, I'm sorry to see you like this.
Don't you patronize me.
The world opened up to you, and you spit in its face.
It's no longer cool, Mikey.
It's pathetic.
I'm not writin'a bookl
'Cause I don't live in the past, manl
You worried about the advance?
I spent it one night!
Gave the Lower East Side a shot of life!
[Engine Starts]
They want their money, they can sell my organs in a couple of months!
And the street lamps... can't light the potholes in the sidewalk... or the traffic jams at night.
The hollerin'... and the horrors,
silent, except inside my head.
So I go deaf in destitution... and make the floor my bed.
I can lie on the two-lane blacktop, embrace the wheels of chance.
[Thunder Rumbling] One more blast of dying, and my soul will live forever, 'cause my body lives inside my mind.
[Thunder Rumbling] When you're dead, you're dead, Mikey.
What's it gonna be?
Is that what you want?
I don't know, man!
My soul is slogging' through oatmeal!
[Grunting]
You had it all, Mikey.
You had it all.
You know, I really wanna do business with you.
'Cause your supply has a reputation of being good.
But I can't wait forever.
I got a hundred-key order to fill.
What's your name again?
Cooper.
Well, Cooper, there's only a slight problem.
I don't jeopardize myself, and I don't jeopardize my people.
And until I get that case back, there's no business to be done.
Well, in that case,
I think that Don Gallego is retired.
Well?
He shut down.
It's that important to him?
So it seems.
No deal.
He's not sellin'... until he gets his briefcase back.
If he gets it back, then he's willing to deal.
100 keys of crack next week.
He's also onto Mikey.
I don't think we can wait for Switek to come up with something.
I say we gotta press real hard on Mikey.
Do it.
Keep Switek's cover.
Guys, bring up number seven.
Okay, lock up number seven.
Bring up number four.
Hey, what are you doin'?
That's not number four.
?
[Singing]
?
[Stops]
What is this?
Huh?
Who in the hell are you, and what are you doing?
I'm with them.
What are you, a new homeboy?
Yeah.
What are you doing?
Elvis.
That ain't Elvis, man.
That's a nickel-and-dime impersonation of an Elvis impersonator.
You wanna see Elvis, huh?
You wanna see Elvis?
I'll show you Elvis.
Watch.
You got somethin' for this, Dr. Kick?
Huh?
Yeah.
Yeah!
I am the king.
[Sobbing]
[Continues]
Mama.
Mama.
Mama, Mama, I hate this place.
They love me till I got nothin'.
Mommy.
Mommy.
I can't do this no more.
[Sobbing]
Mikey, Mikey!
Mikey, Mikey.
Pleasel Mikeyl Call a doctorl Somebody.
Please call a doctor!
[Crockett] "I love this deadly thing.
"Big white wall of locomotion tightening my veins.
"Independence Day in my arm.
"Wild mousing' up my shoulder and into my chest.
SweetJesus, make me stop."
You did that good.
Man, how can you be so sensitive and such an idiot about Don Gallego?
Pito, get him his own copy.
Look at this.
That's so neat, it looks like an altar compared to the rest of this joint.
It is an altar.
He copies everything.
Do you worship your copy machine, Mikey?
I convey what I see.
Get off it, will ya.
You can't see your hand in front of your face, man.
Don Gallego was here, and he's comin' back.
He's gonna do you.
I'll eat Gallego.
I'll chew him up.
I'll eat you.
I do not exist in fear.
No!
You know where you exist?
Self-indulgence.
And stupidity.
Other people are gonna die, Mikey.
Let me talk to him in private.
I did time with the brother.
I just need to talk to him in private.
Just a minute.
Excuse me.
You know how much that case is worth?
We got the big jackpot, man.
Now, where is it?
It's a dream, man.
It's a dream.
A dream, man?
I ain't lived with you in the joint for nothin', man.
Hey, man, don't get nuts.
Give it to me.
I'll deal with Gallego.
You don't know how to handle business, Conejo.
What are you talkin' about?
I'll take care of it.
Mikey.
Mikey, just lay down, man.
I'll take care of business.
I'm all right.
I don't want you doin' nothin'.
Let me handle it.
You ain't gonna make it to the street.
I'll go to the moon then.
Watch me.
[Laughing]
This guy really gets to you, doesn't he?
First time I busted him, six months later he sent me a thank-you note.
[Chuckles]
And tickets to a play he had written... about goin' cold turkey in the joint.
Called TheJolt.
I'm tellin' you, Rico, his stuff is—
[Sighs] So real, so honest.
Tells you so much.
You find a— You find a light in a guy like that, and you wanna cut through the crap—
Sonny.
Sonny, man.
- Once a junkie—
- Yeah.
Always— Ajunkie.
Gallego will kill Mikey.
Look.
That's where I found it.
You know Mikey.
He copies everything.
He's in trouble now.
Whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You work for Gallego.
If I was workin' for him, you'd be dead right now.
I'm a cop.
You're a cop?
I'm here to help.
Help who?
[Phone Rings]
It's like talk radio around here, huh?
Yeah.
Crockett.
You found what?
Yeah, hurry up.
We're waitin'.
Switek thinks he's found copies of what's in the case.
He figures Mikey's on his way to sell it.
Hey, Paco, wait up.
Wait up.
Stop the car.
Don Gallego.
I can help you, man.
You can help me?
Yeah, yeah, man.
How can you help me?
Um, I can take you to your case.
If you pay a premium.
Now, you know what happens if you're lyin'.
Hey, man, look.
I'm not lyin', man.
Come on.
Let's go.
Okay.
But you gotta ride in the trunk, okay?
What you talkin' about, ridin' in the trunk?
You stink.
You smell.
I got velour in there.
You think I want stink on my velour?
I'm not ridin' in nobody's trunk, you know.
You're not?
[Lock Clicks]
Your friend doesn't mind.
You blew it, Conejo.
I had this man's money.
You was born stupid.
You die stupid.
Come here, okay?
I wanna talk to you for a second, okay?
Come on.
Listen, Gallego.
What?
You know, maybe we could, like, talk, you know?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
About what?
Work out somethin'.
What?
You know, like, uh—
What if I turn over the rest of the papers?
You wanna tell me somethin'?
Why don't you do somethin' with your hair?
Hey, come on, man.
What are you doin'?
Looks a mess.
What are you doin', man?
You should do somethin' with your hair.
[Grunts]
This guy's got contacts as far north as Bangor, Maine.
Look at this.
Higher Light Funeral Home.
Higher Light Funeral Home and Higher Light Funeral Home.
How many funerals is this guy paying' for?
How many of'em cost $75,000?
Where's Mikey?
Well, I'm pretty sure him and his pal took the case to Gallego.
Why the funeral home?
It's a cover for a crack lab.
The embalming room acts as a lab.
And they got cold vaults there to store the property in.
Yeah, and a crematorium to reduce it to ash... if it even looked like it was gonna become evidence.
And nobody just wanders in there by accident.
Get on Gallego now.
I'll get the warrants for the mortuary.
[Woman Screaming] Oh, my Godl
Oh!
Ohl Heyl
Oh, Godl Lookl
There's a body!
Oh, man.
?
[Man Singing]
Get some help.
I'll kill you, man.
I'll kill you.
Oh, Mikey.
?
[Continues]
[Police Radio, Indistinct]
[Phone Rings]
Crockett.
Yeah, we're on our way.
He's at the funeral home.
Let's go.
?
[Continues]
Switek, where are we?
[Switek On Walkie-talkie] Waiting for backup.
- Trudy?
- We're in position.
A shoe.
Did the man say "shoe"?
Yeah, it's a shoe.
It's from the trunk of Gallego's limo.
Wanna bet on who it fits?
Look at that.
Guys, check out the rooftop.
[Gina] Where there's smoke, there's bound to be something burning in there.
All right.
We can't wait.
Let's go.
- What about backup?
- The hell with backup.
Let's go.
Freeze!
[Siren Wailing]
Drop your weapons!
Freezel Miami Vicel Drop your gunsl
[Switek] Freezel
Sonnyl
[Shouting In Spanish] Let's go!
[Shouting In Spanish]
Let's gol
Move!
Move!
Move!
Rico?
Ricol
[Tubbs] Go, manl
Switek, take him down!
Let's go!
Boy, I tell you.
I'm gettin' sick and tired of this clean-up detail.
You know what I mean?
[Shouts In Spanish] Open it up!
Hit it!
[Gas Ignites]
Freeze!
Don't shoot.
Shut it down!
Shut it down!
Put it down!
Now!
Against the wall.
Up against the wall.
Someone's missing.
Take 'em down.
Turn around!
Hands up against the wall.
Need a lift?
Don't even twitch, sucker, or I'll shoot your ears off.
Put your hands on your head.
Put 'em up there!
He's dying, isn't he?
I'm sorry.
There's nothing else we can do.
?
[Continues]
You know, Mikey started a hundred good things, and he screwed up every damn one of them.
But it doesn't have to be that way with the theater.
Whether it lives or dies is up to y'all.
He's asking for a couple of undercover... pigs.
?
[Continues]
So, you didn't tell me you killed Gallego.
No.
But we got him locked up.
Stupid.
Kill him.
Save your energy.
For what?
Tomorrow we play touch football?
I don't wanna die this way.
I came into this world bloody and broke.
[Panting] I swore I'd die with money in my pocket.
Till I'm gone... let me hold some for five minutes.
?
[Fades]
He's not gonna make it through the night.
Yeah.
Look, uh, can you see to it that we get the money back?
"Ajunkie, a thief, a mugger I've been.
I've committed every known sin."
I don't know how the guy could get out of bed, much less break into the pharmacy and steal 50 grams of Dolophine.
How far can he get?
Nearly dead, no money.
You take a check?
Bob, I'm gonna catch me some breakfast.
- I'll see you in about an hour.
- Okay.
Look at the time.
I gotta run, Mom.
Michele, sit down and wait for your father.
- I'm gonna be late.
- You have plenty of time.
He keeps complaining that he doesn't see you anymore.
He says he thinks he saw more of you when you were away at college.
Good morning, hon.
Oh, hi, your eggs are ready.
Does our daughter live here, Marge, or does she just drop in for breakfast?
Daddy, I've been working late at the newspaper.
You're always asleep by the time I get home.
You're right, pumpkin.
I can't remember the last time I was up past 9.
Thank you.
On mornings like this, I'm sure not feeling any younger.
You know, you never think of yourself anymore.
You should really take a rest sometime.
She's right.
Why don't we take the day off?
I'll make us a picnic lunch and we can sit on the beach like we used to.
Well, I sure would like to, hon, but Tony's expecting me.
All right, all right.
Let's go to the 6:00 show, the new one, if you want.
Tony sure loved hearing about the one we saw together last week.
Dad, you've been there every day since I've been home.
You should think of yourself sometimes.
I do think of myself.
I seem to be the only one in this family who thinks of Tony.
Gene, Michele, let's not argue again.
My son needs me.
So do your wife and daughter.
He doesn't even know you're there.
This is perfect timing.
The half-day charter just got in.
I'm looking for some bloodworms.
An old friend of mine once told me that's what the big ones bite on.
Mark.
Mark Gordon.
I can't believe my eyes.
It's great to see you.
You're looking great.
Well, you're looking good too.
This is Jonathan Smith.
This is Gene Malloy.
This man right here taught me everything I know about fishing.
Nice to meet you.
Heard a lot about you.
Thanks.
What a surprise.
I've gotta get Marge out here.
She'll never believe it.
We gotta rent you an outfit.
Why?
I like what I got on.
I'm talking about fishing equipment.
You knew that.
Mark, I thought Gene was imagining things.
I can't remember the last time I saw you.
- It's been too long.
- Yeah.
- Jonathan Smith.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.
- What brings you guys to these parts?
Well, I wanna see my old buddy and maybe get in a little fishing.
What time does the afternoon charter go out?
No, no, we don't do afternoon charters anymore.
Oh, well, we got the easy life now.
How about you and me going out?
You know, we could make a little wager or two.
I'd like to, but I was just heading out to see Tony.
Tony?
He must be out of school and working by now.
I haven't seen him since high school.
What a great kid.
Tony went to college on scholarships in track and music.
- What's he doing now?
- He's over at the Convalescent Home.
Say, would you guys like to come along with me?
- Might do him some good to see you.
- Convalescent Home?
What's he doing there?
What happened?
Well, there was an accident a few years ago.
Tony and Michele, they were swimming.
You know, those kids were around water all their lives.
Michele's okay, but Tony's had a rough time of it.
He's been in a coma ever since.
Anyway, look, would you guys like to come along?
- Yeah, sure.
- We'll see you later, darling.
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.
You guys gonna stay for supper?
When we come back,
I can fix up some of that fish stew you like so much.
Sounds good to me.
Look who's here, son.
My old fishing buddy, Mark Gordon.
And that's his friend Jonathan Smith.
Remember, you used to call him Uncle Mark.
Come here.
Come here, Mark.
Come here.
Come on.
Say something to him.
Take his hand.
Hi, Tony.
Do you remember me?
Of course he remembers you.
I knew you would.
You remember how mad Mark used to get when you'd out-fish him?
- And you were just a little fella then.
- Listen...
He's had a rough time, like I said, but he's hanging in there.
He's a fighter.
Aren't you, son?
We're gonna be back fishing together someday.
The boat's just sitting there in the water--
Gene...
Is there a bathroom in the hall?
Yes, back down the hall on the right.
We'll be back, Gene.
I just--I can't go back in there.
It's the saddest thing I've ever seen.
Why can't he see that he's hopeless?
Because to Gene, he's just having a rough time of it.
- I mean, Tony can't hear him.
- We don't know that.
He's unconscious.
Mark, people have come out of comas and remembered what they heard.
People they love talking to them.
I just can't handle Gene not being able to deal with it.
He is dealing with it in his own way.
Well, I can't.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Okay.
I'll tell him something came up.
We'll come back, pick him up later and take him back to the house.
It's almost four years, but I remember it like it was yesterday.
When the police came to the door and told us the kids were in the hospital.
Well, it's a parent's worst nightmare.
How'd it happen?
I mean, Tony was always such a good swimmer.
They were both like two fish in the water.
But Michele got a cramp and she called to Tony to help her.
He was a lifeguard.
Before he could get to her, he was caught in the undertow.
Another swimmer heard her and got to her in time, but by the time they found Tony, it was...
Couldn't they do anything for him?
Michele finally, after a year, convinced us that Tony wouldn't wanna live like that anymore.
So it was the hardest decision we ever had to make, but we decided to take him off the life-support system.
It didn't change anything.
And Gene goes to see him every day?
Doesn't miss a day.
Not one.
Maybe having somebody there could help in Tony's recovery.
That's all Gene had to hear, and so he just--
He'll never give up.
Never, even if it kills him.
Well, I can't go and see my son like that.
And that's what's killing me.
I can't understand why things like this happen to nice people.
That's a question I can't answer.
I mean, Tony was such a bright kid with a great future ahead of him.
It just doesn't seem fair.
Come on, let's go get Gene.
- What happened?
- Looks like a heart attack.
My God.
I'd better call Marge.
I was feeling fine.
I don't know how this happened to me.
The doctor said you were very lucky this time that it wasn't a heart attack.
You're not as young as you used to be.
You try to do too much.
We told you, Daddy, you needed to rest.
You know, you haven't taken a vacation in years.
If you take care of yourself, the doctor said this doesn't have to happen again.
It won't happen again.
I just wanna know when I can get out of this place.
- You've only been here for five days.
- Well, I've got things to do.
Like going to see Tony?
I don't suppose either of you have been there.
- Daddy, you're really being un-
- Oh, no, please.
Michele, let's not start.
Will you quit faking?
Hey, Mark, come on in.
Listen, old buddy, if you didn't wanna go fishing with me, that's all you had to do was just say so.
Some visit this turned out to be.
You guys were gonna surprise me, and look what I pulled on you.
Hey, don't worry about it.
You'll be out of here in no time.
Can't be soon enough for me.
This man can't sit still for two minutes.
Well, unless he's got a fishing pole in his hand.
Mark, you done any fishing yet?
No, not yet, but we're gonna hang on for a while.
So if there's anything we can do to help...
No, no, no.
Everything's under control.
Happy to give you a hand with the boat.
- No, we can handle everything.
- Gene, it might not be a bad idea.
I mean, if Mark and Jonathan don't mind.
Mind?
No, we'd be happy to.
Are you sure?
You guys are supposed to be on vacation.
Will you quit arguing?
Okay, okay, I won't argue.
- Good night.
- Michele.
Look, I don't wanna say goodbye like this.
- I don't wanna say goodbye at all.
- That's not what you said an hour ago.
I was angry.
Do you blame me?
Yes, I blame you.
You could've been more understanding.
How long do I have to be understanding?
How many times are you gonna tell me we have to postpone the wedding?
This has been going on for two years now.
- My father needs me now.
- Michele, I need you now.
First, it was your brother, now your father.
I'm tired of being in third place in your life.
I mean, you act like everything that's happened was your fault.
The conversation's over.
- Hi.
- Mr. Smith.
Trouble with having houseguests, you can't even have an argument in private, I'm sorry.
Don't be.
It's been coming on for a while now.
Can't blame him.
He loves you.
Then he should understand.
Come on, you can marry him now.
You can still help your father financially.
I can't.
Not until...
Not until what?
I can't.
Michele.
You deserve happiness too, you know.
Good night.
It's great to be out in the fresh air again.
I can't wait to get back to the old routine.
Hey, will you slow down, pal?
It's that old routine that got you in that condition in the first place.
No, I'm as good as new.
I feel like I had a vacation.
A few nights in a hospital bed is not a vacation.
You heard what the doctor said.
A little trip will do you good.
That is a great idea, a little trip.
That's just what the doctor ordered.
I've got things to do, that's all.
Jonathan and I have got everything under control.
You've got nothing to worry about.
Maybe.
Let me think about it.
But first, I wanna stop off and see Tony.
Mark, you take him, okay?
I wanna get back to the store.
You just don't realise how much you enjoy your own bed until you've been away from it for a few days.
You never had trouble sleeping up at Valhalla Waters.
As a matter of fact, we could be sleeping up there by tomorrow night, since Mark and Jonathan are going to take care of things down here.
They don't know how to run the business.
And business has been bad enough.
But it's only for a few days.
Remember how much we enjoyed the last visit?
A little rest would do us a world of good.
Honey, I know it would, but I just couldn't enjoy myself right now.
- I feel so far behind with everything.
- Why don't you say it?
It's because of Tony you won't go.
- No, it's not just because of Tony.
- Then why?
What about all our plans?
The time we dreamed of together when the kids were little?
- We still have time for all that.
- When?
Gene, we've had a scare.
It's a sign.
It's time to take care of us.
Then who's going to take care of Tony?
He could outlive all of us.
What then?
He will.
He will get better, and he will take care of himself.
Gene, stop fooling yourself.
This is it.
This is the way our son's life is going to be.
And I can't stand to watch this anymore.
We've got a full load this morning.
- Isn't Marge here yet?
- No, I haven't seen her.
What's going on?
She knows the three of us are going out this morning.
Gene, don't worry about it.
I can stay here and watch the store.
No, no, no.
No answer.
She's on her way, I'm sure.
Daddy.
Michele, did you see your mother this morning?
She's gone.
That's why I'm here.
- What are you talking about?
- She packed up and left.
Where did she go?
She wouldn't tell me.
Don't act surprised.
What did you expect?
You know, Mom hasn't even existed these past two years.
It's Tony, always Tony.
Day after day, sitting with someone who doesn't even know you're there, while your wife sits alone.
She doesn't have to sit alone.
She can come along with me.
And do what?
Stare at what used to be her son?
What do you mean, used to be?
He's my son.
I just wish you could see the progress he is making.
You know the doctors would tell you if there were any change in his condition.
The doctors don't know everything.
They don't sit with him every day.
I do.
Oh, Daddy.
The other day, I was telling him about a movie we liked.
I saw him move his finger.
He was telling me he liked it.
Daddy, Tony can't tell you anything.
He's a vegetable, and he always will be.
Why don't you take the day off?
We got the boat covered.
- Hey, you got trouble?
- Yeah, the stupid thing won't start.
Pop the hood, I'll take a look.
I shouldn't have said those things.
No, you shouldn't.
Doesn't he see what he's doing to his family?
All we do is argue.
I'm telling you, it's always the same.
Tony, Tony.
I mean, doesn't he know that I love my brother as much as he does?
Then why don't you go see him?
Michele, if you'd just visit Tony, then maybe your dad would have some time for himself and for your mother.
I'm telling you, it's hopeless.
He doesn't feel anything, he doesn't know anything, he doesn't remember anything.
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.
Try the engine again.
Wayne.
It's good to see you.
Mrs. Malloy, welcome back.
Haven't seen you in quite a few years.
Oh, I know it has been quite a while.
I didn't make a reservation.
This was kind of spur-of-the-moment.
There's always room for you.
Where's the mister?
- Gene couldn't make this trip.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Your favourite room is vacant.
Oh, thank you.
I think I'll take a walk.
- Just put my bags in the room, okay?
- You bet.
Hello, Marge.
Jonathan, how did you know where to find me?
You talked about coming here.
I just took a chance.
What's happened?
What's wrong?
- Gene, is he all right?
- No, no, no, he's fine.
I didn't mean to alarm you.
We came here on our honeymoon.
And then for years afterwards with the kids.
This was our special place.
We thought that we might live here one day and...
Then everything changed the last few years.
I know.
Something like this can do one of two things to a family, either bring them closer together or tear them further apart.
The three of you are letting it tear you apart.
Jonathan, you don't know what it's like.
My son died.
- I can't even bury him.
- Marge, he's not dead.
He's not alive.
I love my son.
But I can't-- I just cannot go on living this way.
- Then do something about it.
- What, for God's sake?
Go see him.
Go see him.
I did for over a year.
Then why did you stop?
Because it was no use.
Why do you think that I convinced Gene to tell the doctors to take him off the machine?
Is that when you stopped seeing him?
Yes.
That was the hardest decision I've ever had to make in my life.
Sometimes you wish he was dead, don't you, Marge?
- What?
- You heard me.
Don't you wish that sometimes?
Yes, yes, yes, damn it, yes!
So that we could stop the suffering and the waiting and the praying.
Yes, yes.
Marge...
Marge, don't avoid seeing your son because of guilt.
That's what you're doing.
But guilt is such a waste, it's so useless.
Marge, you love your son.
I-
- I--
Then see him.
Marge, see him and love him.
Michele sends her love, son.
I wish you could see what a beautiful young woman your kid sister's turned out to be.
No more tomboy.
I'm real proud of her.
She's got a big job as a reporter at the DailyTribune.
And she wants to get married real soon.
Married, my baby daughter.
Maybe you'll be able to come to the wedding, son.
We'd all like that.
I'm really worried about your mom, son.
She'd never done anything like this, not in 25 years of marriage.
I really miss her.
I love your mom and sister.
Well, thanks for listening.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
I love you, Tony.
How long have you been here?
Not long.
No.
Long enough.
Look, Gene.
I know it's none of my business, man, but when is the last time you said that to your wife or daughter?
Said what?
What you just said to Tony.
That you're proud of Michele, you're worried about Marge.
And that you love them.
Of course I love them.
They know all that.
Maybe they do, but we all need to hear it once in a while.
It's not easy to say.
Who said it was?
You don't seem to have any trouble saying it to Tony.
He's easy to talk to.
Why?
Why, Gene?
Because he doesn't answer back?
Gene, listen to me.
Tony needs to know how you feel.
But so does Michele and so does Marge.
I don't know what to say anymore.
We always end up in an argument.
But you can't stop trying.
If you stop trying, then this whole family may as well be in a coma.
I don't wanna be the only one who has hope anymore.
Gene, you need to tell them.
Tell your wife and daughter how much you need them before it's too late.
- Jonathan.
- In here.
Jonathan, did Marge call by any chance?
- No, but I saw her today.
- Where?
Up at the Valhalla lodge.
The lodge?
So that's where she went.
I should have known.
Gene, you gotta go up there.
Just for a few days.
She needs you away from all this.
I can't, not now.
Oh, come on, what did we talk about back there?
You have got a daughter.
She can visit Tony while you're gone.
She won't go.
I've already asked her.
No, you accuse her, you yell at her.
Have you ever just sat her down and asked her?
Told her how much it would mean to you and her mother?
Have you?
All right.
I'll try.
- I waited up for you last night.
- I was working on a story.
Your mother's up at the lodge.
Jonathan talked to her.
Well, good for her.
I was thinking about driving up there to join her.
- Daddy, do you mean that?
- Yeah.
I thought I'd drive up there this morning to surprise her.
- That would be great.
- But there is one thing, though.
I can help Jonathan and Mark with anything that comes up at the pier.
They can call me at work if they need me.
Thanks.
That's not what it is, though.
Oh, no.
Dad, not Tony.
Don't ask me to do that.
- Michele, he's your brother.
- That body is not my brother.
My brother is dead.
Don't you ever say that again.
Tony.
I brought you some new tapes.
I thought you'd like them.
You are going to get better.
I don't care what anyone says.
I'll always be with you, son.
I won't let you go.
Never, never, never.
How you doing?
It's really lovely, isn't it?
Oh, yes.
Yes, it is.
You got the best seat in the house to watch the sunset.
I bet I've watched a thousand sunsets from this spot.
This must've been a fun place to grow up in.
- Like being on vacation all the time.
- I didn't grow up here.
My dad bought this place when I was in high school.
I guess we've lived here about eight years.
Where'd you live before that?
Another little town by the ocean.
With my dad's business, we always live near the water.
Your dad's a great guy.
I bet your brother Tony is a lot like him.
Was, not is.
I think you're writing your brother off a little too soon.
- Now, you sound just like my dad.
- What's wrong with that?
My dad blames me for what happened to Tony.
Does he?
It sounds to me like the only one blaming you is yourself.
Oh, no.
He blames me.
If Tony wasn't trying to save me, this never would've happened.
Come on, you don't know that.
He was out there swimming.
He could've been by himself and the same thing would've happened.
But he wasn't.
And I called to him for help, and look what happened.
That's why he thinks it's my fault.
You can't go through your whole life feeling guilty.
I don't feel guilty.
My father's just never gonna forgive me.
I know that.
He doesn't blame you.
He never says it, but he does.
All he cares about is Tony.
He's not even gonna leave him to go up and see Mom.
Well, he would if you'd help out a little bit.
- I've already told him no.
- Why?
That's my business.
You wouldn't understand.
You talk a lot about wanting to help your family.
Why don't you do something for a change?
I mean, what's it gonna hurt?
A few visits.
Unless it is you that feels guilty.
I said I don't.
I have no reason to.
Then prove it.
Tell your father he can go to the lodge.
Tell him you'll go see Tony.
All right.
All right.
I'll go stay with Tony.
Satisfied now?
Look, leave me alone, will you?
Will you smell that fish?
I mean, there is nothing like it.
Are you sure you got enough?
The last time I saw a fish that large, Gregory Peck was on his back.
Well, that's very funny.
Listen, Gene is getting along better with his family, so I got my appetite back.
See you later.
I'm going to visit Tony.
- Hey, want some company?
- No, don't worry about it.
I made a promise, remember?
Boy, what a change.
I think that's the first time I've seen her smile since we've been here.
Yeah, she's a good actress.
What do you mean?
I mean, tonight Michele is gonna have her moment of truth.
The real truth.
More beautiful than ever.
Yes, it is.
I meant you.
I missed you.
I missed you too.
I don't wanna talk about anything except to say, it's always been Tony, nothing for you.
And I'm gonna try to change, but you have to help me.
You have to let me keep my hope.
You understand?
I need us to hope and pray as a family.
Will you try?
God, it seems like yesterday.
Come on, scaredy-cat.
The red flag is not up as a joke, you know.
- There's a riptide today.
- Will you stop?
That flag's for babies and old people, and you know it.
It's for everybody, sis.
Well, nobody's here and I just wanna get wet.
- See you.
- Hey, I told you no.
My supervisor comes, I can get fired.
- Michele.
- Tony.
- Michele!
- Tony!
- Michele!
- Tony!
Michele!
Tony!
- Oh, God, oh, God.
- No more running.
- Please, I can't stay here.
- Yes, you can.
No, I can't.
- God, forgive me.
- He has nothing to forgive you for.
What happened happened.
You couldn't have known.
But Tony told me not to go in, and I did and I killed him.
He isn't dead.
Michele, your brother isn't dead, and he doesn't blame you.
Yes, he does.
That's why I can't look at him.
You have to.
You have to look at him, and you have to tell him how you feel.
Michele, he's your brother.
You have to tell him.
Do it.
Tell him.
Go on, he's your brother.
Tell him.
Tony...
You know, what happened was all my fault.
I did this to you.
God, I wish I had died that day.
You should have let me.
Oh, God, forgive me, Tony.
Please forgive me.
Jonathan.
Jonathan.
He loves you.
Your brother loves you.
I'll tell you something, Jonathan.
I always knew.
Deep down inside, I always knew.
Just don't expect too much.
Don't worry, I'm realistic.
But the doctors are shocked.
They said he'd never move again and he has.
I'm gonna keep praying and I'm gonna keep talking.
We all are.
As long as he knows we love him, he's gonna keep on fighting, I know it.
- Hi, hon.
- I'm going over to see Tony.
You want me to take those new tapes you bought him?
You went by this morning.
I'll take them over.
No, no, it's okay.
I'm going anyway.
Rick got off early, and I thought it was about time
Tony met his future brother-in-law.
Hey, let her take them, will you?
We haven't had our afternoon of fishing yet, you know.
Oh, okay, okay.
You take them over, honey.
Tell Tony I'll see him tomorrow.
Okay, see you later.
- Hey, Marge.
- Yeah?
You wanna go fishing?
What do you say?
What about the store?
Just put up the sign:
"Gone Fishing."
Hey, you wanna spend time with your husband or don't you?
I'll be right back.
WHITE LION MANE

Vienna is something touching and crazy.
For the horrible teacher.
Thank you thank you.
Let me,.
-Quita.
Come on, Leo, dance.
-Come on man.
Come one, two, one, two.
He spent seven years working as a slave in his Jenufa.
Brno is not enough, now wants to Prague.
Humming sound of the human voice and birds.
Leos, are you thinking about that again?
-In which?
-In Jenufa.
'What you want me to think?
-On my feet.
You know I can not dance. -lnténtalo at least.
I lntentarlo ...
Who is with Olga?
It is our medical student.
Is our?
It is an unknown.
Leos do not tell me you're jealous.
Falling in love at seventeen is immoral, Olga.
¿Ycuántos old was mom when you married?
When he said he wanted me, I was fourteen.
You were sixteen when we married.
That's it.
And that was immoral?
Dislike.
That man is not enough for you.
- And how do you know?
Calm down.
You not even know him.
Olga.
Please.
Do what you want.
Well, I will.
Like when someone says what you're thinking.
So I felt with Antonin Dvorak.
Acantar should learn from the birds, nature.
Musical notes which reveal the truth of life and vice versa.
How to take your Jenufa, Leos?
Pronto finish the score, maestro.
I really want to hear at the National Theatre.
Have you already become the ride?
Sorry, but I can not breathe.
Suddenly, he could not breathe.
It was horrible.
It was not my fault sick of typhus in Petrograd.
It was you who sent there.
You were afraid of her suitors.
I blame my own enough.
I fear for his life.
We lost our Vladirmir.
Do not mention it, please.
-Leos, That was fate.
-Destiny?
It was one of yours irresponsibility.
'I'll take and how you take ...
No, no, no.
Of course.
You will not escape.
'I've escaped.
Wait.
Easy, no issues.
It's a ghost.
At your house, you idiot dog.
What is that for?
A opera?
For a melody of the word, a window to the soul.
At your house, you idiot dog.
I've heard that before.
Do you know when?
At that ride.
Oh yeah.
At your house, you idiot dog.
Maybe this is my last Christmas.
Do not Cry.
I know I'm going to die.
Papi ... touching, please.
You do not want to wait for the premiere?
I can not be in the theater.
It would be the best gift.
Protect my Shtevushka.
Stay at his side.
Oh, mercy mother.
Who is it?
Honey, are you awake?
Open the window.
You have to Shtevushka in arms?
Take the key.
Open, open the door.
My hands are shaking cold.
Where is Shtevushka?
Why did you let him in the mill?
You left in the mill.
Shteva may come.
Dear mother, poor baby.
You're delirious.
God help you.
But you do not know what happened.
Get two days sleeping fever.
What, Dad?
It's very sad, Olga.
But I want to hear it.
Do not worry, I can handle it.
You've been sleeping for two days with fever ... and your son is dead.
He has died.
He has died.
Has died... has died.
My son, who gave me so much joy.
My small, he has died.
My heart is full of pain.
But you've always said that it would be best for him.
I could never give him that God would give him.
So it is dead.
Now he is an angel.
But I am lonely without him.
How hard is.
I have to mourn ...
Thank God.
Give thanks to God.
You are now free again.
It's beautiful, it's a shame.
I will not see.
Doctor, come on, quick.
It has to help.
How?
There has to be solved.
I beg you, doctor.
I can not do anything.
I do not want to die.
I want to live.
Does it hurt much?
I have fear alone.
I will die, I will die.
What are you writing?
They are melodies.
I'm pointing your words.
Let me see it.
How good.
I am with you even after ...
Do you hear?
The cars go to the dance.
Olga, dear.
-But I...
¿Me perdonarás?
You have not been cheerful.
You have not enjoyed.
I have been very strict with you, but I've done for love.
I have to go.
Vladimir died at eleven o'clock.
And I also.

Too bad that is not going to view it.

No good at all.
-Do not Cry.

Mother.
Why do you sleep in bed Olga?
To dream about it.

Under the tree Annie Janicek and played cards.
Both passionately they played.

It's a pretty patient, right?
Have you been searching for his health or lovers?
Do you know her?
The Roses is Mila Urvalkova.
Her husband left yesterday.
What is your diagnosis?
She had a lover and was a scandal.
I think it was a composer Leos.
A portrait is spectacular.
Does it matter if I do not wear the national costume?
What attracts strangers?
What mysterious magnetism joins two lonely hearts?
Love.
Will not the destination?
You and me here ...

Miss Maria Calma.
Charmed.
It is my fiancee.
Congratulations, Frankie.
Calma is a singer.
¿Singer?
Frankie always tells me about you and your Jenufa.
If you please, could firmármela, master?
In the piano part.
This was published by Frantisek.
It was not just because of me.
-Thanks, teacher.
-Take.
Because you are a singer, why do we not sing something?
Of course, sing.
-¿Se You know my opera?
-Do not.
-¿La Will sing reading it?
-Yes.
I start?
Santa Maria...
Mother of grace.
Sweetness woman ... your art is our hope.
Santa Maria.
Santa Maria, we ... the exiled children of Eve ...
We adore you.
It was a very special evening.
For me too.
His teacher was the great Karel Kovarovic.
Sorry.
I forgot your hatred for the director of the National Theatre.
It's your fault.
Any nonsense you know better than my work.
Someday you'll hear singing Calma Jenufa in Prague.
Someday...
Someday and will soon master.
How pretty.
Marino, do not laugh like a child.
What are you doing awake?
Someone has to clean.
When a woman works he was not upset.
I am working!
I do not know what you write.
Anyway, no one will touch.
The opera without arias never be famous.
What nonsense.
The arias are no longer useful.
The arias make opera arias.
Drama.
Opera is drama.
Be quiet!
What is this, gentlemen?
What happened, Hudecek?
Professor, has published the book ...
Modern Czech opera after Smetana.
And so you fight like animals?
They have written about you.
Read to Me.
Because I?
-Léemelo.
-Lee.
Begins.
Come on.
" In Jenufa, Janarek wanted to write a drama according to their theories.
But only he managed to take them to the realm of the absurd.
A drama without emotional depth.
Obviously Janarek is a formalist.
It's antagonist Smetana ... and applying primitive ... melodies evokes something unnatural.
It is a fateful experiment in which we do not appreciate the lack of humanity. "
Throw it in the bin.
It composed as if in battle.
Toss it.
Have not you slept, Leos?
Leave me alone.
Out!
What happened?
Tell me.
Even my own students to teach me music.
No reviews have been written in Libuse.
Does everyone have to write like Smetana?
I can not express my opinion without worrying about retaliation?
There are things that should not be criticized.
I do not know lie and I will not.
Well, do not talk.
Nor do I think silent.
Then he suffers.
You also think that what I write is useless, right?
-Leos.
-Let me.
I will not cry.
I will not give them that pleasure.
If Dvorak was alive ...
Beautiful, Leos, beautiful.
I'm like an old tune piano.
-Do not say that.
Mozart became famous as a kid.
But at what price?
¿Envidias his untimely death?
No, not his death.
You should not fear it so much.
I sometimes close the notice.
It will not come until you have not squeezed the last note.
How I can give everything if anyone touches my music?
And you are not.
You can not write opera to write, you have to touch it.
Leos, go home.
Than?
You'll catch cold.
I go.
Leos.
Your disease is called Jenufa.
No, Frankie.
It's over, poor Olga.
Soon I will be with her again.
Yes, after the premiere in Prague.
-Because what you say?
Know something?
You have many enemies there.
They are pedants who venerate the dead and not rely on the new.
I can not see you Jenufa, Calma.
Yes me see.
-I do not think so.
I do not want celebrations, please.
Profesor Janacek ...
Good thank you.
Sit down.
I have always said that plasmaseis reality in your music.
Have I taught well despite not receiving good reviews?
However, what today is rejected ... or even ridiculed ... tomorrow will be...
Well, whatever.
Congratulations, Professor.
We will help you.
For real.
We are on your side.
I know thanks.
You are good guys.
Leos Janacek.
Leos Janacek.
¡Leos Janacek!
'I accuse of stealing people voices.
-That is not true.
Leos Janacek, has stolen the music of the Moravian songs.
I have not taken a single note of folklore, not one.
Get him out of here, the temple of art!
No, no.
Did you get something in Prague?
Your student, Mr. Hudecek, has come to say goodbye.
Goodnight.
What this means, Hudecek?
I have to go to the front, master.
My son...
Mara, fix him something good that can be carried on the train.
Hurry up.
The main thing is to come back healthy.
The bells are carried.
Run.
Slow down, slow down.
I do not know what I could have done ... if you had not come ... on time.
I do not know, I do not know...
I could have done ...
I could have done.
Do you also think that what I have against Janacek's staff?
No.
His criticisms were harsh, but did not offend me.
Janacek much respected.
The score of Jenufa is technically incomplete.
But it could be improved.
Es demasiado stubborn.
-A Dvorak was easy to tell.
-A You also make you case.
Lady defends why so much?
Has he promised the lead role?
No, but I think I'm the only one who can play the character.
Yes.
I see.
He has composed the music with their blood.
It is new, different, it's beautiful.
But a lot:
" I do not know, I know, I know, I know, me too, me too. "
It's unnatural, very unnatural.
What did you say?
Go?
People unknowingly repeats.
The most important thing is to be a success.
You've got it.
It's a miracle.
Beware, Leos, or not arrive at the " great day ".
Frankie.
What Kovarovic?
He's excited.
I do not think so. ¿Kovarovic excited?
The only... he wants to make some corrections in the score.
I was also made to Dvorak, right?
Oh yeah?
Well, why not?
You need your consent.
Kovarovic is an excellent musician.
I've always said.
Kovarovic is our expert on opera.
I give the child to God.
It will be faster and easier.
In spring with the thaw, so they will not be footprints.
It will go with God, because he knows nothing of this.
It will go with God, because he knows nothing of this.
Then we cast all the blame on Jenufa and me.
Then we cast all the blame on Jenufa and me.
Look at her.
Look at Kostelnicka.
Born in sin, dear God.
Steva's soul lives steeped in sadness.
iMuy well!
ibravo!
ibravo, master!
You've been great, excellent, incredible and charming.
So Kostelnicka imagined.
For real?
Yes.
A parent, beautiful woman.
I am happy to play such a beautiful role.
No, you are my Kostelnicka.
Mine, mine.
And you are my ...
It is my temper.
You just got here and already you go again.
I have to go to trial.
Kovarovic is amazing.
Have not you've fallen for him?
And Calma?
Will Jenufa?
No.
Why?
She was the one who got you accept it.
Yes, but not part of the cast of the National Theatre.
You promised it.
I can not promise anything.
I had to wait thirty years for this.
And I appreciate you being on stage.
She has fought for this.
You do not know how it is.
Nobody gets what he wants.
Even Kovarovic.
No, I do not want to go to church.
So little do you want God, Leos?
To me the church means death.
Death?
So what do you think?
God and nature.
Come On.
Come On.
¿Ves?
Pictures of torture ... crosses ...
Here death breathe.
So much have to fear death?
I hate her.
He took my two children.
Jelcha ...
I even went to the funeral of my own mother.
I need money for the house.
Money, only you want money.
-Prague Is costing you a lot.
Yes, life in Prague is more expensive.
I know very well why you go there much.
Are you jealous again?
Just for your eyes Kostelnicka.
Jelcha is a great woman.
The call by his nickname.
It is a magnificent soprano ... and respects me.
Do you respect?
As an actress.
Respects you ...
For you what I write is nonsense.
You did not want to come to the National Theatre.
You'd want to go to visit the grave.
Money money.
As a market.
Lord, will catch cold.
I'm not that old, do not help me with my coat.
Recently the master Janacek was dying.
That is the past.
I like to look ahead.
I Ique well!
All are getting married to avoid the army.
But I will not marry the army I'm not afraid.
I Ique well!
The rich pay to get rid ...
But I am poor and have to be a soldier.
The rich pay to avoid going to the army.
I have to be a soldier and that means ... there will be no women in my life.
He eventually love.
He will finish the ... -iBasta!
This can not be.
Be quiet.
What can not be?
The choir can not sing " I have to be a soldier " ... and then back to say:
" I have to be a soldier. "
What do you mean, " I will "?
We are at war.
It would be an honor!
An honor?
Nobody wants to be a soldier.
Would you like to go to war to kill?
The revised text would read:
" I want to be a soldier. "
Do I make myself clear?
The choir will sing: " I want to be a soldier, " and you say:
" I will be a soldier a great honor. " Try as well.
I will be a soldier very honored ... and love will end.
Go?
Even it fits.
I Ique well!
All are getting married to avoid the army.
But I will not marry the army I'm not afraid.
I Ique well!
The rich pay to get rid ...
But I am poor and have to be a soldier.
iQue well!
I have to be a soldier ...
-...
And love will end.
He eventually love.
Love will end.
Steva, Steva dear.
It will not come until you have not squeezed the last note.
I loved myself more than I wanted you.
You can no longer say: " Dear Mother, dear mother. "
You can not inherit my blood and my character.
Now I take my strength ...
I suffer, suffer.
El Salvador see my baseness.
God help you.
Come on, Mayor.
Take me.
God help you.
Jenufa ... my beloved, I can soportartodo porti this.
For you I can endure all this.
What we care about the world ... if we have each other.
Laco me Amado ...
Friend, friend.
Finally, love has joined us ... this great love in the eyes of God.
It's a shame that you will not be able to see it.
iBravo!
ibravo!
iMaravillosa, Leo!
ibravo!
Are you going to see?
I want to know where Jenufa born.
Why do not you take all the National Theatre?
Does the teacher have chickens?
Son home.
Come here, buff, see The teacher loves!
Get out of here.
You can not give me what she did.
I'm going to file for divorce.
Well, go ahead.
Removed.
Your wife is great, Leos, have everything ready in the suitcase.
Even he puts us some scones for the trip.
This medicine is better than the mineral water you drink.
Being with itself.
Why are you so sad suddenly?
Jelcha ...
You're my last passionate desire.
-The last?
For real?
-Yes.
Zdenchi ... what have you done to me?
Morphine.
You made a nonsense.
-Excuse me.
You did silly.
I felt very alone, Leos superfluous.
The true love is not achieved only ennobling love?
Our love keeps me alive.
You're the only thing I think.
I am happy because we live together ... and because I can be good to you.
Zdenchi ... you are delusional.
-Are you.
Leos, honey.
-It's me.
You're still a student.
Come, come, come.
Here.
Once you sent me eight letters from Leipzig in one day.
Yes, I'm a little crazy.
I loved you very much.
No I'll never leave, Zdenchi.
I have to make up for lost time.
But I still do not know how.
Congratulations, Mrs. Calma.
-Good Morning.
-Good Morning.
How are you, Mrs. Calma?
-Welcome.
Am I that old?
Will this be the end?
My spa.
Here I have been very happy.
-Are you?

Are you sure you are?
He's my son Otto.
I also had a child, Vladimir.
Sit with us.
Thank You.
Toma.
You are alone.

You are not in the path.
I love the sun.
Yel is better here, right?

It's a shame, but I have a brewery.
I'm a composer.
Do you compose songs?
That is also very good.
The army called my husband ... para que se people.
I ytengo afraid to send him to form rows.
I also had a family.
And his sons?
You do not have grandchildren?
I lost everything, I can only music.
Music?
How sad.
Very sad.
May all be happy, like me.
Buy happiness.
Buy happiness.
