Bye.
She can't forgive me for what I put them through.
To be honest, I don't blame her.
Well, when the Captain finds the right place for us to put ashore,
maybe you can all start again on more solid ground.
Captain, I've got baltimore.
A Mrs. Granderson is on the line.
Did you say Granderson?
- Yes, sir.
- Well, put her through.
They're trying to use the vidcom, but so far it can only get audio, sir.
- Go ahead, sir.
- This is Tom Chandler,
Commanding Officer of the U.S.S. Nathan James, over.
Captain Chandler.
You have no idea how good it is to hear your voice.
We thought you were lost at sea.
No, ma'am, we're alive and well.
- Oh!
There you are.
- I got it.
You must be nearby.
I'm Amy Granderson.
And I suppose an explanation is in order.
As vice-chair of the President's Defense Policy Board,
I was briefed on your mission to the Arctic.
I knew the risks of the coming pandemic, and I had my daughter transferred to your ship.
You must forgive me.
No apology needed, ma'am.
Your daughter's been an incredible asset.
Pleased to hear from you.
We had no word from the presidential bunker.
President Geller invited me underground.
I declined.
I-I felt the risk was too big to have so much of our civilian and military command in one confined space.
Unfortunately, I was right.
So the government is gone.
For the most part, yes.
Since the bunker went silent, there has been a breakdown of infrastructure, general panic, and, of course, a tremendous loss of life.
I have tried to execute a contingency plan working with the state and local police to create safe zones.
We have been hanging on as best we can.
And I have been praying every day for your return.
Ma'am, we can be in Baltimore in the matter of hours.
In the meantime,
I'm sure there is someone you'd like to speak with.
Mom?
Alisha!
Mom, I don't...
I don't understand...
What are you doing?
Where are you?
I'm here, darling.
Oh, I knew you were out there.
I just knew it.
Thorwald.
We've intercepted a transmission.
A U.S. Navy ship is due to make port in a matter of hours in Baltimore harbor.
- What kind of ship?
- I don't know, sir.
Well, is it a tug?
A destroyer?
A 5,000-sailor aircraft carrier?
The signal was spotty.
All we know is the name.
Nathan James.
It's the ship they've been hailing for weeks.
Granderson's sending out a greeting party.
Well, if they're having a party... then let's party.
We are cleared, Baltimore.
...the port distance 1,000 yards.
No threats, no contact.
All commands reporting...
V.B.S.S. on the way to designated meeting point.
E.W. reports negative rackets of interest.
Nothing moving on surface plot.
Clean picture.
Bridge?
C.I.C.
A.T.T.W.O. reports S.C.A.T. team manned and ready at all crew-served weapon stations port and starboard.
All right, let's move.
- Fan out.
- Aye, sir.
Secure a perimeter.
Dennis and Rowler, left flank.
Cruz, you take right.
Keep your hands on the swivel, fellas.
Perimeter secure.
Keep eyes on upper structures.
Copy.
Here they come.
I'm Lieutenant Pete Norris of the Maryland state police.
Inside my vehicles are my assistant Barrack commander, my criminal section supervisor, and a few surviving state troopers.
You don't need the masks.
We're not sick.
I'm Lieutenant Green, this is Lieutenant Burk.
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lieutenant.
Bridge, Burk.
The pier is secure.
All clear, over.
Understand.
All clear on the beach.
Landing party underway.
- Welcome to Baltimore.
- Hey, it's great to be here.
Looks like the troopers just got themselves a couple hundred U.S. sailors.
A few dozen Tomahawks, too.
Looks like a landing party arriving.
Including the captain.
You must be Lieutenant Norris.
Tom Chandler, C.O, Nathan James.
Pleasure to meet you.
This is Lieutenant Landau.
- Ma'am.
- Sir.
Hey.
How y'all doin'?
Just fine, now that you're here.
We can escort you guys back to our H.Q.
Here comes another van.
Cobra 1 in place.
All clear on the beach.
Holy shit.
What?
Mom?
I had to come see for myself.
Oh, my baby girl.
It's her.
It's Granderson.
She came out herself.
I am so glad to have you back.
Captain Chandler, thank you.
Thank you for returning my daughter to me.
Privilege, ma'am.
We wouldn't be here without her.
Take the shot.
Mrs. Granderson, we really need to get you back in the vehicle.
She's blocked.
Come.
Everyone's eager to meet you.
I can take out the fat man.
No!
You only have one shot.
- I want her.
- Nathan James, looks like we're having a bit of a family reunion here.
We're headed out with the group.
Sending Lieutenant Norris and some troopers back with the V.B.S.S to update you on the situation on the ground, Sir.
Roger that.
We'll arrange a welcome for Lieutenant Norris.
Oh, and say "Hi" to mom for us.
Damn it!
I lost her.
Talk to your friends on the inside.
Find out what they're doing here.
We were fortunate to find this building.
There's only one coal-fired plant still operational, and we have a direct line.
Plus, strategically we're far enough from the city to avoid infection.
You'll be safe here.
Come.
Mom, this is amazing.
Oh, yes, but it's been a battle.
And who's the enemy?
Warlords, they call themselves.
And recently, they've killed more people than the actual virus.
Do you know they raided the National Archives?
They actually tried to steal original copies of the Constitution.
As if that could take away who we are as a people.
Captain.
I didn't want to broadcast about the virus over an open radio feed, but... the President told me that you had the materials to produce a vaccine.
Is that true?
Yes, ma'am.
We've actually made a little more progress than that,
Mrs. Granderson.
We have the cure.
Fort Detrick was our first option, too.
They had the lab and all, but, uh,
- Thorwald got there first.
- Thorwald.
Former Baltimore P.D.
Turned self-proclaimed leader of the warlords.
Been a real pain in our ass since this whole thing started.
I shouldn't complain.
I imagine you've been through a hell of a time yourselves.
Listen, Lieutenant, last I talked to my wife, she said was taking the family to Deer Park.
Safe zone.
Heard of it.
You know if it's still there?
There was fighting, but there are survivors.
I can get you there as soon as we get you off the ship.
Ooh!
Thanks, doc.
You have no idea how good that felt.
Well, I have some idea.
Yeah.
What were the results of the test...
See, these results are consistent...
Now this is the main reason we chose this building.
We've worked for months trying to develop a cure.
But now you're here.
It's heavenly.
You're not gonna like this, boss.
My guy inside Granderson's said the ship came back with a cure.
It could be bullshit.
We've heard this before.
Not from the U.S. Navy.
If that's true, Granderson will spread out, go anywhere she wants.
We will lose the city.
We need to get our hands on the cure.
It's probably locked away somewhere on the ship.
The only way is to take Granderson on directly.
We have to take her lab.
Extraordinary.
Look at her.
She's in love with a toaster.
You still haven't made your move yet?
Oh, I've been making my move since Gitmo.
She ain't buying what I'm selling.
I thought once she saved the world, she'd let loose a little.
Nathan James, this is Vulture One.
Do you copy?
This is her letting loose.
I repeat...
Nathan James, this is Vulture One.
Do you copy?
I can't get through, Sir.
You won't get a signal here, Master Chief.
The Warlords are jamming the local frequencies.
They have a radio room, Sir.
I let the X.O. know where we are.
Ma'am, uh, if that radio room is still available,
I'd like to get word to my family,
See if they're still out there.
I think it's time you thought of yourself.
Meanwhile, we can work with your team to arrange safe transit here for your ship's crew.
- Due to warlord activity...
- This is Tom Chandler, listening on a spread spectrum, looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater, Virginia,
- or parts nearby, over.
- Citizens are advised to avoid these areas until further notice.
- Power has been...
- This is Tom Chandler, listening on a spread spectrum, looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater, Virginia, or parts nearby, over.
...and some city services are set to resume.
This is Tom Chandler, looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater, Virginia, over.
This is Tom Chandler, looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater, Virginia, over.
Howdy.
Tex.
Hey, listen, just wanted to let you know that I'm heading off.
Heading off?
What are you talking about?
I'm moving on.
By yourself?
But it's chaos out there.
I've seen worse.
And thanks to you, I can travel wherever I like.
Where will you go?
I, uh, got things to take care of.
The young girl whose picture that you keep in your locket.
Among other things, yeah.
Anyway, you seem to have things plenty well in hand here.
Right then.
Oh, you're a special woman, you know that?
You take care now.
What the hell.
This is Tom Chandler, looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater, Virginia, over.
This is Tom Chandler, U.S. Navy, looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater, Virginia, over.
- Tom?
- Dad?
Dad?
Are you there?
It's me.
It's Tom.
I'm back!
- Tom?
- I'm here, dad.
Tommy?
Are you at the cabin?
- We're going to...
Baltimore.
- Baltimore?
!
Are you with the kids?
!
Darien?
!
We're sick.
We had to leave the cabin.
Going to Olympia.
It's our only hope for a cure...
Come quick.
We're sick!
Tell me exactly where you are.
What do you see?
- Onyx Truck Stop.
- Truck stop?
What happened?
Are you on the road?
Onik truck stop.
It's a tire shop downtown.
We can get you there.
Listen to me.
Stay put.
I'm coming for you.
Put these jackets on.
You'll blend in better.
We're in and out, gentlemen.
Dad!
Dad?
- Let's get eyes. 360.
- Darien?
Dad?
!
Darien?
!
Where did you get this radio?
Where did you get this radio?
!
Answer me!
It's mine now.
The man you took this radio from, where did he go?
!
- Man, everybody's going to the same place
- Where did he go?
!
- The arena!
- Where?
!
What arena?
!
- Olympia!
- Olympia.
Come on!
Let's go!
- Can't do that, sir.
- What do you mean?
Olympia's off-limits.
It's for sick people.
But we're immune.
You got the shots, too.
Get back in the car.
We're going back to base.
We're going to Olympia.
You don't give the orders, captain.
Get back in the cars!
Drop your weapons!
- Get back in the car!
- Drop your weapons!
You don't want to do this, trooper!
We're on the same side!
Everybody calm down!
Master chief!
I'm all right!
I'm okay.
Nathan James, this is vulture two.
Come in!
Damn it, still can't get through!
Take the truck, get the master chief back to the ship.
- And tell the X.O. what's going on!
- What is going on?
!
Find a way to get the others back to the ship.
We're getting out of Baltimore.
You okay?
What about us?
We're going to Olympia.
You'll inform the others then?
Very good.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
All good.
Everthing's under control.
I want to try and look for Sarah.
I-if you survived, there's a chance that maybe she's still okay.
Alisha...
Your friend lived in Wisconsin.
There's no way to get there now.
- Soon, maybe.
- But if we make...
Soon.
Now...
Tell me this...
What kind of man is Captain Chandler?
He's amazing.
Without him, we wouldn't have gotten through any of this.
So he hasn't the let the power go to his head?
I'm not sure I understand the question.
I'm asking if he will still follow orders.
Follow orders from whom?
Mother, what's going on?
Michael, have you seen these protocols?
Of course.
Why?
Well, Dr. Hamada claims that his treatment prolongs the lives of the infected.
But his whole assumption about the virus seems to be wrong.
I'm just a statistician, but the data he's given me suggests the treatment's working.
No, that's impossible.
- Is something wrong?
- Dr. Hamada, you're using ribavirin to introduce higher error rates to the virus' D.N.A. replication.
In a chemical cocktail, yes.
Yes, but the pandemic virus is error-free.
Your treatment wouldn't have any positive effect whatsoever.
In fact, these dose levels are highly toxic.
Go through the turnstile and wait for assessment.
Daddy?
Daddy?
- Daddy!
- Ashley!
- Daddy!
- Ashley!
- Daddy!
- Oh, my god.
Sammy...
Sammy...
Daddy... daddy... we're sick.
I know, baby.
I know.
Daddy's gonna make it better, okay?
Where's mommy?
Tommy...
Where's your mother?
- Tommy...
- Dad, why didn't you wait for me?
Sam, a little pinch.
A little pinch.
This is gonna make you feel better.
Tommy...
Where is she?
Son, I'm sorry.
Dad, where's Darien?
!
She's gone, son.
She's gone.
I tried to do everything I could to save her.
I tried.
I tried.
I know you did, pop.
I know you did.
But right now I gotta give you this.
You stack the cases by the hangar door, we'll put 'em on a pallet and unload 'em dockside as soon as we make port.
I'm not sure exactly when that's gonna be...
Oh, hey, Norris, answer a question for us if you could.
Yes, sir.
Commander.
Commander!
I want you to get on the horn and give the order to drop anchor.
You muster your entire crew on the flight deck and you open up the door to the helo bay where you're storing the cure.
I'm not giving you a goddamn thing, you son of a bitch.
I don't know what your plan is here, but this is my ship!
- You'll do exactly what I say, or I'll pick off your entire crew one-by-one.
My troopers are everywhere.
This ship is mine now.
Please, he needs help.
Call Doc Rios!
Nobody moves!
Nobody moves!
Put down that weapon!
Everyone heard that gunshot.
They're gonna come running.
You don't think I'll do it, X.O.?
!
Put down that weapon!
You think I won't do it, X.O.?
Just try me!
I'm not gonna tell you again, commander.
Muster your crew.
Doctor.
My troopers say they experienced no side effects from the cure.
It's amazing what you've created.
I wish I could say the same in return.
I understand you have some questions about the way we've been treating the sick.
What you are giving the sick is anything but a treatment of that I am sure.
Doctor...
You know this.
In the 14th century, the black death wiped out 60% of the European population.
The plague killed indiscriminately... the artists, scientists, thinkers, so few and precious to begin with, were wiped out.
It upended the social order and prolonged the dark ages 150 years.
I cannot let that happen here.
I understand your allegiance to your friends.
You've gone through so much together.
But you've seen nothing of the chaos here at home.
The hysteria, the cruelty, the savagery.
You must try to see the situation from our point of view.
There are people out there who would use this crisis to take what does not belong to them.
They are the barbarians at the gate who would send us into a new dark age.
We have the power to stop them, to keep them in their place.
It is my duty to help the right people first, the people whose survival will ensure the future of our entire society... and all that we hold dear.
So you gather your elite few within these walls.
And the rest...
What happens to them?
The virus doesn't discriminate.
That unfortunate task falls to me.
Pl...
Plea... plea...
Please...
Hey, what are you doing?
You can't be here!
You're killing them.
Get the hell back behind the curtain!
- You're killing them!
- Stay back!
- You sick bastards!
- Hey, you can't be here!
Captain, we gotta move!
Security breach in section 12.
Repeat... security breach in section 12.
I don't...
I don't...
I don't get it.
They're burning 'em.
They're burning the bodies to power the city.
I know it's hard to understand.
You've been away so long.
But in time, Rachel, you'll see it's the only way.
She was trying to run.
Dr. Scott, I swear I had no idea this was happening.
- I swear...
- Hush, dear.
You can't replicate my work with the doses that I've given you.
Everything that you need is locked up on that ship.
And the captain will never give it up.
You let me worry about the captain.
Daddy...
We have to go.
Nathan James, come in.
Do you read me?
Nathan James, come in.
Do you read me?
Nathan James, this is the captain.
Come in.
Do you read me?
Nathan James, come in.
Do you read me?
Nathan James, this is the captain.
Come in.
Do you read me?
Nathan James, where are you?
Come in, anyone.
Anybody out there?
[SOBBING]
We're sick.
I'm broadcasting in the blind.
Mama?
Mama?
JED:
In the blind!
- Mama, please don't fall asleep.
Mama, we're gonna get you help.
- Wake up, Mama, please!
JED:
Anyone, come in, please.
Anyone out there?
Anyone, damn it!
SAM:
Mama, please don't fall asleep.
Wake up, Mama.
Mama!
What's your name?
You sure you have enough for the whole crew?
And 50 or 60 more.
When we get home, we can use this as a vaccine and a cure?
Well, the uninfected will be immunized... and the sick can be cured... providing they're not too far gone.
After all the failures and the false starts...
I just feel so...
Happy?
[SCOFFS]
I can't remember the last time that I felt that emotion.
Still so much to do.
We have to mass-produce it...
- we have to distribute it.
My God.
- Rachel.
You did it.
Let's enjoy the moment.
I told her how I feel.
I mean, basically, I spilled my guts to her.
I mean, sure, I'm spiking a hundred-and-four-degree fever... but still, you know.
"You make me wanna love again."
I actually said that.
And what does she give me?
Zip.
What I understand about women, you'd fit in a shot glass.
I don't need to tell you.
[WHIMPERS]
Hey, how are you feeling?
I don't get seasick, so...
I've never seen morning sickness on a DDG before.
Have you seen a nursery?
No.
Form up.
[SIGHS]
Okay, here's the deal.
We're attempting to make contact... with the infectious disease lab at Fort Detrick... as it is just the facility Dr. Scott requires for mass-producing the cure.
So far we've had no joy.
I'll be honest... knowing how deadly this plague is and how fast it spreads...
I don't have any confidence that there's gonna be any survivors, so...
That being said, there's a reason they call it a fort.
And if anyone can hold their own... it's our friends in the U.S. Army.
- Master chief.
- Thank you, sir.
I wanna address the issue that's on all of our minds.
On our way up the coast, our ship will be passing right by Norfolk.
By home.
Our comms team tells us we could pick up... some orphan signals from random cell towers... or servers still online.
You may even get a phone call if they've restored power on land.
It's unlikely, but I just wanna prepare you.
We don't know what to expect when we get back to the States.
Only way to help the people we love is to deliver Dr. Scott and the cure... to a secure and workable lab.
Detrick's our best bet, so that's our mission.
ALL:
Aye, sir.
- Carry on.
Any station in vicinity of Fort Detrick...
USAMRIID, this is USS Nathan James, over.
Aye, sir.
Captain, SSES reports that the keyhole satellite... will be flying over our whiskey in 50 seconds.
Unable to steer... but they did manage to break the uplink encryption.
Bringing up the feed now.
- It's traveling fast.
- Too fast, sir.
There's no one left to control it.
When it gets over the area, we'll have a minute to capture the images.
We'll just need enough to chart a route from the land to the lab.
We've tapped into one of the Air Force's spy satellites to check the traffic to Fort Detrick.
Well, why not send your helicopter or drone?
No more fuel.
They spent it all looking for me.
KARA:
Satellite passing over us.
MAN:
This is USS Nathan James, over.
- Any station in this net...
- Come on, give us something.
- This is USS Nathan James.
Over.
- There it is.
Home.
SLATTERY:
That's Interstate 70.
- If clear, it'll get us all the way to Detrick.
There'll be some image blur, but I'll get you closer, sir.
That's a mass evacuation.
- Take us north a mile.
- Aye, sir.
Any station in this vicinity of Fort Detrick...
USAMRIID, this is USS Nathan James.
That red X, some sort of quarantine?
More like a warning sign to stay away.
Looks like people took it seriously.
Sir, the satellite's approaching Fort Detrick.
I say again, anyone at Fort Detrick, please respond.
The laboratory building's in the center of campus.
Roger that, ma'am.
Zooming in.
Oh, my God.
It's been completely destroyed.
The lab, the containment areas... the equipment, everything.
Nothing else on the base was burned.
That lab was targeted.
Who would've done that?
Slow down.
Slow down.
Stop the car.
- Where you going?
- My family's sick.
They need help.
- You can't go this way.
Turn around.
JED:
Please.
- Please, we're trying to get to Olympia.
McGREGOR:
Olympia can't help you.
Go back where you came from, old man.
Get down.
[SCREAMS]
Should we go after them?
No.
They'll be dead soon.
MASON:
Sir!
Sir!
Take a breath.
What is it?
I caught a new broadcast.
It's another loop, but this one was updated today.
And there's something you need to hear.
WOMAN:
Winds are coming southwest... and temperatures will reach 50 degrees in Baltimore.
How come we're hearing this now?
A weak FM transmitter.
It must've just come into range.
There are reports of an outbreak of the Red Flu...
Red Flu.
Is that what they're calling it?
- Doesn't do it justice, somehow.
- It's looping around.
Here it comes.
Nathan James, we are aware of your mission and we have secured the facility you require.
If you are within range of the signal, we urge you to reply over channel 1-6.
I repeat, USS Nathan James... if you are still out there, please reply on VHF channel 1-6.
- Get them on the line.
- Yes, sir.
This is U.S. Naval warship Nathan James hailing you on channel 1-6.
We have heard your call, over.
This is U.S. Naval warship Nathan James hailing you on channel 1-6.
We have heard your call, over.
Baltimore.
We'll set a course in that direction.
Agreed.
We may still be too far out.
Then let me know as soon as you find out.
Good work, son.
WOMAN [ON RADIO]:
Schools have reopened in Sector 3... and some city services are set to resume.
[COUGHING]
Attention, attention.
This call goes out to the crew of the USS Nathan James.
We are aware of your mission and we have secured the facility you may require.
If you are in range of the signal we urge you to reply over channel 1-6.
I repeat, USS Nathan James, if you are still out there...
- Jed?
- Did you hear that, Darien?
Tom's still out there... and people are waiting for him.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
You're gonna make it.
You hang in there.
QUINCY:
I had to do what was best...
KELLY:
Best for who?
QUINCY:
Please listen.
KELLY:
How could that...
SCOTT:
Ava?
KELLY:
Quincy, we have been through it.
QUINCY:
This is not fair.
- They're at it again.
KELLY:
Tell me what this is.
QUINCY:
You know that I love you.
Events, just, they keep happening and have a mind of their own...
I know that things are better now... but I don't think they'll be the same again.
- Hello, Kelly.
- Hi.
- Ava, darling, shall we find something to eat?
- All right.
- I'll see you later.
- I'll see you later.
Bye.
She can't forgive me for what I put them through.
And to be honest, I don't blame her.
Well, when the captain finds the right place for us to put ashore... maybe you can all start again... on more solid ground.
MASON:
Captain, I've got Baltimore.
- A Mrs. Granderson is on the line.
- Did you say Granderson?
- Yes, sir.
- Well, put her through.
They're trying to use the VIDCOM, but can only get audio, sir.
- Go ahead, sir.
- This is Tom Chandler... commanding officer of the USS Nathan James, over.
GRANDERSON [OVER RADIO]:
Captain Chandler.
You have no idea how good it is to hear your voice.
We thought you were lost at sea.
No, ma'am, we're alive and well.
Oh, there you are.
- I got it.
- You must be nearby.
I'm Amy Granderson... and I suppose an explanation is in order.
As vice-chair of the President's Defense Policy Board...
I was briefed on your mission to the Arctic.
I knew the risks of the coming pandemic... and I had my daughter transferred to your ship.
You must forgive me.
No apology needed, ma'am.
Your daughter's been an incredible asset.
I'm pleased to hear from you.
We had no word from the presidential bunker.
President Geller invited me underground.
I declined.
I thought the risk was too big... to have so much of our civilian and military command in one confined space.
Unfortunately, I was right.
So the government is gone?
For the most part, yes.
Since the bunker went silent... there has been a breakdown in infrastructure... general panic, and, of course, a tremendous loss of life.
I have tried to execute a contingency plan... working with the state and local police to create safe zones.
We have been hanging on as best we can.
And I have been praying every day for your return.
Ma'am, we can be in Baltimore in a matter of hours.
In the meantime, I'm sure there is someone you'd like to speak with.
Mom?
Alisha.
Mom, I don't...
I don't understand.
What are you doing?
Where are you?
I'm here, darling.
Oh, I knew you were out there.
I just knew it.
Thorwald.
We've intercepted a transmission.
A U.S. Navy ship is due to make port in a matter of hours in Baltimore Harbor.
- What kind of ship?
- I don't know, sir.
Well, is it a tug?
A destroyer?
A 5000-sailor aircraft carrier?
The signal was spotty.
All we know is the name.
Nathan James.
It's the ship they've been hailing for weeks.
Granderson's sending out a greeting party.
Well, if they're having a party... then let's party.
MAN 1 [OVER RADIO]:
We cleared Baltimore, port distance 1000 yards.
No threats, no contacts.
MAN 2:
All commands reporting forced rigging.
VBSS on the way to designated meeting point.
WOMAN:
E-W reports negative rackets of interest.
Nothing moving on surface plot.
Clean picture.
MAN 3:
Bridge, CIC.
ATTWO reports SCAT team manned and ready... at all crew-served weapon stations port and starboard.
All right, let's move.
Fan out.
- Aye, sir.
- Secure perimeter.
Dennis and Rowler, left flank.
Cruz, we take right.
Keep your heads on a swivel, fellas.
MAN 4:
Perimeter secure.
MAN 5:
Keep eyes on upper structures.
MAN 4:
Copy.
SLATTERY:
Here they come.
Contact the front.
Hi.
Hey.
I'm Lieutenant Pete Norris of the Maryland State Police.
Inside my vehicles are my assistant barrack commander... my criminal section supervisor, and a few surviving state troopers.
You don't need the masks.
We're not sick.
I'm Lieutenant Green, this is Lieutenant Burk.
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, lieutenant.
Bridge, Burk.
The pier is secure.
All clear, over.
Understand.
All clear on the beach.
Landing party underway.
- Welcome to Baltimore.
BURK:
It's great to be here.
McGREGOR:
Looks like the troopers just got a couple hundred U.S. sailors.
A few dozen Tomahawks too.
McGREGOR:
Second landing party arriving.
THORWALD:
Including the captain.
You must be Lieutenant Norris.
Tom Chandler, CO, Nathan James.
Pleasure to meet you.
This is Lieutenant Landau.
CHANDLER:
Ma'am.
- Sir.
Hey.
How y'all doing?
Just fine, now that you're here.
NORRIS:
We can escort you guys back to our HQ.
THORWALD:
Here comes another van.
MAN [OVER RADIO]:
Cobra 1 in place.
All clear on the beach.
- Holy shit.
- What?
Mom?
I had to come see for myself.
Oh, my baby girl.
It's her.
It's Granderson.
THORWALD:
She came out herself.
GRANDERSON:
I am so glad to have you back.
Captain Chandler, thank you.
Thank you for returning my daughter to me.
Privilege.
We wouldn't be here without her.
Take the shot.
Mrs. Granderson, we really need to get you back in the vehicle.
She's blocked.
Come.
Everyone's eager to meet you.
I can take out the fat man.
No.
You only have one shot.
I want her.
Nathan James, we're having a family reunion here.
We're headed out with the group.
Sending Lieutenant Norris back with the VBSS to update you... with the situation on ground, sir.
Roger that.
We'll arrange a welcome for Lieutenant Norris.
Oh, and say hi to Mom for us.
Damn it.
I lost her.
Talk to your friends on the inside.
Find out what they're doing here.
GRANDERSON:
We were fortunate to find this building.
There's only one coal-fired plant still operational... and we have a direct line.
Plus, strategically, we're far enough from the city to avoid infection.
You'll be safe here.
Come.
Mom, this is amazing.
- Yes, but it's been a battle.
- And who's the enemy?
Warlords, they call themselves.
And recently, they've killed more people than the actual virus.
Do you know they raided the National Archives?
They actually tried to steal original copies of the Constitution.
As if that could take away who we are as a people.
Captain.
I didn't wanna broadcast about the virus over an open radio feed... but the president told me that you had the materials to produce a vaccine.
Is that true?
Yes, ma'am.
We've actually made a little more progress than that, Mrs. Granderson.
We have the cure.
Fort Detrick was our first option too.
They had the lab and all, but Thorwald got there first.
- Thorwald?
- A former Baltimore P.D... turned self-proclaimed leader of the warlords.
Been a real pain in our ass since this whole thing started.
I shouldn't complain.
I imagine you've been through a hell of a time yourselves.
Listen, lieutenant, last I talked to my wife...
- she was taking the family to Deer Park.
- Safe zone, heard of it.
You know if it's still there?
There was fighting, but there are survivors.
I can get you there as soon as we get you off the ship.
Thanks, doc.
You have no idea how good that felt.
- Oh, I have some idea.
- Yeah.
What were the results of Test 37?
See, these results are consistent...
GRANDERSON:
Now, this is the main reason we chose this building.
We've worked for months trying to develop a cure... but now you're here.
It's heavenly.
McGREGOR:
You're not gonna like this, boss.
My guy inside Granderson's said the ship came back with a cure.
It could be bullshit.
We've heard this before.
Not from the U.S. Navy.
If that's true, Granderson will spread out.
Go anywhere she wants.
We will lose the city.
We need to get our hands on the cure.
It's probably locked away somewhere on the ship.
The only way is to take Granderson on directly.
We have to take her lab.
SCOTT:
Extraordinary.
Look at her.
She's in love with a toaster.
- You still haven't made your move?
- I've been making my move since Gitmo.
She ain't buying what I'm selling.
I thought once she saved the world, she'd let loose a little.
BURK:
Nathan James, this is Vulture 1.
Do you copy?
This is her letting loose.
I repeat, Nathan James, this is Vulture 1.
Do you copy?
- I can't get through, sir.
- You won't get a signal.
Warlords are jamming local frequencies.
They have a radio room, sir.
I let the XO know where we are.
Ma'am, if that radio room's still available...
I'd like to get word to my family, see if they're out there.
I think it's time you thought of yourself.
Meanwhile, we can work with your team... to arrange safe transit here for your ship's crew.
This is Tom Chandler listening on a spread spectrum, looking for Jed Chandler... in Clearwater, Virginia or parts nearby.
Over.
This is Tom Chandler listening on a spread spectrum... looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater, Virginia or parts nearby.
Over.
And some city services are set to resume.
This is Tom Chandler looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater, Virginia.
Over.
This is Tom Chandler looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater, Virginia.
Over.
Howdy.
Tex.
Hey, listen, just wanted to let you know that I'm heading off.
Heading off?
What are you talking about?
I'm moving on.
By yourself?
But it's chaos out there.
I've seen worse.
And thanks to you, I can travel wherever I like.
Where will you go?
I got things to take care of.
The young girl whose picture that you keep in your locket.
Among other things, yeah.
Anyway, you seem to have things plenty well in hand here.
Right, then.
Uh, you're a special woman, you know that?
You take care, now.
What the hell.
This is Tom Chandler looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater, Virginia.
Over.
[SIGHS]
This is Tom Chandler, U.S. Navy, looking for Jed Chandler... in Clearwater, Virginia.
Over.
JED [OVER RADIO]:
Tom?
- Dad?
Dad?
Are you there?
It's me.
It's Tom.
I'm back.
- Tom.
- I'm here, Dad.
Tommy?
[JED COUGHING]
Are you at the cabin?
We 're going to Baltimore.
Baltimore?
- Are you with the kids?
Darien?
- We're sick.
We had to leave the cabin.
Going to Olympia.
It's our only hope for a cure.
Please, Tom, come quick.
We're sick.
Tell me exactly where you are.
What do you see?
- Onik's Truck Stop.
- Truck stop?
- What happened?
Are you on the road?
WOMAN:
Onik Truck Stop.
- It's a tire shop downtown.
- We can get you there.
Listen to me.
Stay put.
I'm coming for you.
Put these jackets on.
You'll blend in better.
We're in and out, gentlemen.
Dad?
- Dad?
BURK:
Let's get eyes 360.
- Darien?
- Sir.
CHANDLER:
Dad?
Darien?
Where did you get this radio?
- Where did you get this radio?
Answer me!
- It's mine now.
The man you took this radio from, where'd he go?
- Where did he go?
Where?
- The arena.
- What arena?
- Olympia.
Olympia.
Come on.
Let's go.
- Can't do that, sir.
CHANDLER:
What do you mean?
- Olympia's for sick people.
- But we're immune.
- You got the shots too.
- Get back in the car.
We're going back to base.
- We're going to Olympia.
- You don't give the orders, captain.
[ALL SHOUTING]
- Drop your weapon!
- Don't wanna do this.
We're on the same side.
Everybody calm down.
Master chief!
I'm all right.
I'm okay.
Nathan James, this is Vulture 2.
Come in.
Damn it.
Still can't get through.
Take the truck, get the master chief back to the ship.
- Tell the XO what's going on.
- What is going on?
Find a way to get the others back to the ship.
We're getting out of Baltimore.
You Okay?
What about us?
We're going to Olympia.
You'll inform the others, then?
Very good.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
All good.
Everything's under control.
I wanna try and look for Sarah.
If you survived, there's a chance...
- that maybe she's still okay.
- Alisha.
Your friend lived in Wisconsin.
There's no way to get there now.
- Soon, maybe.
- But if we make...
Soon.
Now... tell me this.
What kind of man is Captain Chandler?
He's amazing.
Without him, we wouldn't have gotten through any of this.
So he hasn't let the power go to his head?
I'm not sure I understand the question.
I'm asking if he will still follow orders.
Follow orders from whom?
Mother, what's going on?
Michael.
Have you seen these protocols?
Of course.
Why?
Well, Dr. Hamada claims that his treatment prolongs the lives of the infected.
But his whole assumption about the virus seems to be wrong.
Heh.
I'm a statistician.
The data he's given suggests treatment's working.
- No, impossible.
- Is something wrong?
Dr. Hamada.
You're using Ribavirin to introduce higher error rates to the virus' DNA replication.
- In a chemical cocktail, yes.
- The pandemic virus is error-free.
Your treatment wouldn't have any positive effect whatsoever.
In fact, these dose levels are highly toxic.
Uh...
WOMAN [ON PA]:
Enter quietly and follow instructions once inside.
You will be told which section to wait for treatment.
You will receive medication in sequence of arrival.
Left through the turnstile and wait for assessment.
Do not mass in front of doors.
Enter quietly and follow instructions once inside.
You will be told which section to wait for treatment.
You will receive medication in sequence of arrival.
ASHLEY:
Daddy?
Daddy?
- Daddy.
- Ashley.
- Daddy.
Daddy.
- Ashley.
Oh, my God.
- Sammy.
- Daddy.
- Daddy, we're sick.
- I know, baby.
I know.
Daddy's gonna make it better, okay?
Where's Mommy?
- Tommy.
- Where's your mother?
- Tommy.
- Dad, why didn't you wait for me?
Sam, a little pinch.
A little pinch.
This is gonna make you feel better.
- Tommy.
- Where is she?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Dad, where's Darien?
She's gone, son.
She's gone.
I tried to do everything I could to save her.
- I tried to.
I tried to.
- I know you did, Pop.
I know you did.
But right now I gotta give you this.
Stack the cases by the door.
We'll put them on a pallet.
Unload them dockside as we make port.
I'm not sure exactly when that's gonna be...
Hey, Norris.
- Answer a question for us if you could.
- Yes, sir.
- Commander.
Commander.
- Whoa!
Get on the horn, and give the order to drop anchor.
You muster your entire crew on the flight deck.
Open up the door to the helo bay...
- where you're storing the cure.
- I'm not giving you a thing.
- I don't know your plan...
- You do exactly what I say.
Or I'll pick off your crew one-by-one.
My troopers are everywhere.
This ship is mine now.
Please, he needs help.
- Call Doc Rios.
- Nobody moves.
- Nobody move.
- Put down that weapon.
- You don't think I'll do it?
- Put down that weapon.
You think I won't do it, XO?
Just try me.
[SCREAMING]
I'm not gonna tell you again, commander.
Muster your crew.
[SIGHS]
Doctor.
My troopers say they experienced no side effects from the cure.
It's amazing what you've created.
I wish I could say the same in return.
I understand you have some questions... about the way we've been treating the sick.
What you are giving the sick is anything but a treatment.
- Of that, I am sure.
- Doctor.
You know this.
In the 14th century... the Black Death wiped out... 60 percent of the European population.
The plague killed indiscriminately.
The artists, scientists... thinkers... so few and precious to begin with, were wiped out.
It upended the social order... and prolonged the Dark Ages a hundred and fifty years.
I cannot let that happen here.
I understand your allegiance to your friends.
You've gone through so much together... but you've seen nothing of the chaos here at home.
The hysteria.
The cruelty.
The savagery.
You must try to see the situation from our point of view.
There are people out there who would use this crisis... to take what does not belong to them.
They are the barbarians at the gate... who want to send us into a new Dark Age.
We have the power to stop them.
To keep them in their place.
It is my duty to help the right people first.
The people whose survival... will ensure the future of our entire society... and all that we hold dear.
So you gathered your elite few within these walls.
And the rest... what happens to them?
The virus doesn't discriminate.
That unfortunate task... falls to me.
Please.
MAN:
Hey, what are you doing?
You can't be here.
- You're killing them.
- Get the hell back behind the curtain.
- You're killing them.
- Stay back.
You sick bastards.
[GUNSHOTS]
BURK:
Captain, we gotta move.
MAN:
Security breach in Section 12.
Repeat, security breach in Section 12.
I don't get it.
They're burning them.
They're burning the bodies to power the city.
GRANDERSON:
I know it's hard to understand.
You've been away so long.
But in time, Rachel, you'll see it's the only way.
- She was trying to run.
- Dr. Scott, I had no idea this was happening.
- I swear it...
- Hush, dear.
You can't replicate my work with the doses that I've given you.
Everything that you need is locked up on that ship.
And the captain will never give it up.
You let me worry about the captain.
ASHLEY:
Daddy.
We have to go.
Nathan James, come in.
Do you read me?
Nathan James, come in.
Do you read me?
Nathan James, this is the captain.
Come in.
Do you read me?
Nathan James, come in.
Do you read me?
Nathan James, this is the captain.
Come in.
Do you read me?
Nathan James, where are you?
Come in.
Anyone?
Anybody out there?
[Crying]
We're sick.
I'm broadcasting in the blind.
Mama?
- Mama?
- In the blind!
- [Coughing]
- Mama, please don't fall asleep.
Sam:
Mama, we're gonna get you help.
- [Coughs]
- Wake up, mama, please!
Jed:
Anyone, please?
Anyone out there?
Anyone... damn it!
[Coughing]
Mama, please don't fall asleep!
Wake up, mama!
[Echoes] Mama!
[Click]
[Clicks]
What's your name?
[Click, beep]
[Clicks]
[Clicks]
[Clicks]
You sure you have enough for the whole crew?
And 50 or 60 more.
When we get home, we can use this as a vaccine and a cure?
The uninfected will be immunized, and...
The sick can be cured, providing they're not too far gone.
After all the failures and the false starts,
I just feel so...
Happy?
[Exhales sharply]
I can't truly remember the last time that I felt that emotion.
Still so much to do.
We have to mass produce it, we have to distribute it.
- Thank God...
- Rachel...
You did it.
Let's enjoy the moment.
I told her how I feel.
I mean... [exhales]
Basically spilled my guts to her.
I mean, sure, I'm spiking a 104-degree fever, but still.
"You make me wanna love again."
I actually said that.
And what does she give me?
Zip.
What I understand about women, you fit in a shot glass.
I don't need to tell you.
[Whines]
[Indistinct conversations]
Hey, how are you feeling?
I don't get seasick, so...
[Exhales]
I've never seen morning sickness on a D.D.G. before.
[Exhales] Have you seen a nursery?
[Chuckles] No.
- [Door opens]
- Form up.
[Sighs]
Okay, here's the deal.
We are presently attempting to make contact with the infectious disease lab at Fort Detrick, as it has just the facility Dr. Scott requires for mass producing the cure.
So far we've had no joy.
I'll be honest...
Knowing how deadly this plague is and how fast it spreads,
I don't have any confidence that there's gonna be any survivors, so...
That being said, there's a reason they call it a fort.
And if anyone can hold their own, it's our friends in the U.S. army.
Master Chief.
Thank you, sir.
I want to address the issue that's on all of our minds.
On our way up the coast, our ship will be passing right by Norfolk... by home.
And our comms team tells us we could pick up some orphan signals from random cell towers or servers still online.
You may even get a phone call if they've restored power on land.
It's unlikely, but I just wanna prepare you.
We don't know what to expect when we get back to the states.
The only way to help the people we love is to deliver Dr. Scott and the cure to a secure and workable lab.
Detrick's our best bet, so that's our mission.
All:
Aye, sir.
Carry on.
Any station in this net vicinity of Fort Detrick U.S.A.M.R.I.I.D., this is U.S.S. Nathan James, over.
Aye, sir.
Captain, S.S.E.S. reports that the keyhole satellite will be flying over our whiskey in 50 seconds.
Unable to steer, but they did manage to break the uplink/downlink encryption.
Bringing up the feed now.
[Beeping]
- [Exhales deeply] It's traveling fast.
- Too fast, sir.
There's no one left at home to control it.
When it gets over the area, we'll have less than a minute to capture the images we can.
We just need enough to chart a clear route from the land to the lab.
We've tapped into one of the air force's spy satellites to check the traffic to Fort Detrick.
Well, why not send your helicopter or drone?
No more fuel.
They spent it all looking for me.
Kara:
Satellite passing over us.
[Static]
Mason:
Any station...
Come on, give us something.
There it is.
[Beeps]
Home.
That's interstate 70.
If it's clear, it'll get us all the way to detrick.
There'll be some image blur, but I'll get you closer, sir.
[Clicks]
That's a mass evacuation.
- Take us north a mile.
- Aye, sir.
[Typing]
Any station this net vicinity of Fort Detrick U.S.A.M.R.I.I.D., this is U.S.S. Nathan James...
That red "X"...
Some sort of quarantine?
More like a warning sign to stay away.
Looks like people took it seriously.
Sir, the satellite's approaching Fort Detrick.
I say again, anyone at Fort Detrick, please respond.
The laboratory building's in the center of campus.
Roger that, ma'am.
Zooming in.
[Whispers] Oh, my God.
[Normal voice] It's been completely destroyed.
The lab, the containment areas, the equipment, everything.
Nothing else on the base was burned.
That lab was targeted.
Who would've done that?
Slow down!
Slow down!
Stop the car.
Where you goin'?
My family's sick.
They need help.
Can't go this way.
Turn around.
Please.
Please, we're just trying...
- Trying to get to Olympia.
- Olympia can't help you.
Go back where you came from, old man.
[Window whirs]
Get down.
- [Shifts gear] - [Gasps]
[Engine revs, tires screech]
- [Children scream] - [Gunshots]
[Machine gunfire in distance]
[Engine revs, tires screech]
[Man shouts indistinctly]
Should we go after 'em?
No.
They'll be dead soon.
Sir!
Sir!
Take a breath.
What is it?
I caught a new broadcast.
It's another loop.
But this one was updated today.
And there's something you need to hear.
Woman:
Winds are coming out of the southwest, and temperatures will reach 50 degrees in Baltimore...
How come we're just hearing this now?
Probably a weak F.M. transmitter, sir.
It must've just come into range.
There are reports of a fresh outbreak of the red flu
- in sector 9.
- "Red flu."
Is that what they're calling it?
Doesn't do it justice somehow.
It's looping around.
Here it comes.
U.S.S. Nathan James, we are aware of your mission and we have secured the facility you may require.
If you are within range of this signal, we urge you to reply over channel 1-6.
I repeat, U.S.S. Nathan James, if you are still out there, please reply on V.H.F. channel 1-6.
- Get them on the line.
- Yes, sir.
This is U.S. naval warship Nathan James hailing you on channel 1-6.
We have heard your call, over.
This is U.S. naval warship Nathan James hailing you on channel 1-6.
We have heard your call, over.
Baltimore.
We should set a course in that direction.
Agreed.
- [Door closes]
- We may still be too far out.
You let me know as soon as you find out.
Good work, son.
- [Door alert dinging]
- Schools have reopened in sector 3, and some city services are set to resume.
[Coughs]
Attention, attention, this call goes out to the crew of the U.S.S. Nathan James.
We are aware of your mission and we have secured the facility you may require.
If you are in range of the signal, we urge you to reply over channel 1-6.
I repeat...
U.S.S. Nathan James,
- if you are still out there...
- Jed?
Did you hear that, Darien?
Tom's still out there.
People are waiting for him.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
You're gonna make it.
You hang in there.
[Keys jangle]
[Engine sputters, turns over]
- Quincy:
I had to do what was best...
- [Door opens]
- Kelly:
Best for whom?
- Please listen to that.
Rachel:
Ava?
Kelly:
We have been through it.
They're at it again.
Quincy:
You know that I love you.
Events... they just happen on a mind of their own...
I know that things are better now.
But...
I don't think they'll be the same again.
Hello, Kelly.
Hi.
Ava, darling, shall we go and find something to eat?
All right.
I'll see you later.
I'll see you later.
Bye.
She can't forgive me for what I put them through.
To be honest, I don't blame her.
Well, when the Captain finds the right place for us to put ashore, maybe you can all start again on more solid ground.
Captain, I've got Baltimore.
A Mrs. Granderson is on the line.
Did you say Granderson?
- Yes, sir.
- Well, put her through.
They're trying to use the vidcom, but so far it can only get audio, sir.
- Go ahead, sir.
- This is Tom Chandler, commanding officer of the U.S.S. Nathan James, over.
Captain Chandler.
You have no idea how good it is to hear your voice.
We thought you were lost at sea.
No, ma'am, we're alive and well.
- Oh!
There you are.
- I got it.
You must be nearby.
I'm Amy Granderson.
And I suppose an explanation is in order.
As vice-chair of the President's defense policy board,
I was briefed on your mission to the Arctic.
I knew the risks of the coming pandemic, and I had my daughter transferred to your ship.
You must forgive me.
No apology needed, ma'am.
Your daughter's been an incredible asset.
Pleased to hear from you.
We had no word from the presidential bunker.
President Geller invited me underground.
I declined.
I-I felt the risk was too big to have so much of our civilian and military command in one confined space.
Unfortunately, I was right.
So the government is gone.
For the most part, yes.
Since the bunker went silent, there has been a breakdown of infrastructure, general panic, and, of course, a tremendous loss of life.
I have tried to execute a contingency plan working with the state and local police to create safe zones.
We have been hanging on as best we can.
And I have been praying every day for your return.
Ma'am, we can be in Baltimore in the matter of hours.
In the meantime,
I'm sure there is someone you'd like to speak with.
Mom?
Alisha!
Mom, I don't...
I don't understand...
What are you doing?
Where are you?
I'm here, darling.
Oh, I knew you were out there.
I just knew it.
- Thorwald.
- [Water splashing]
We've intercepted a transmission.
A U.S. Navy ship is due to make port in a matter of hours in Baltimore harbor.
- What kind of ship?
- I don't know, sir.
Well, is it a tug?
A destroyer?
A 5,000-sailor aircraft carrier?
The signal was spotty.
All we know is the name.
Nathan James.
It's the ship they've been hailing for weeks.
Granderson's sending out a greeting party.
Well, if they're having a party...
Then let's party.
Man:
We are cleared, Baltimore.
[Speaks indistinctly]
The port distance 1,000 yards.
No threats, no contact.
Man:
All commands reporting...
Man:
V.B.S.S. on the way to designated meeting point.
Kara:
E.W. reports negative rackets of interest.
Nothing moving on surface plot.
Clean picture.
Bridge?
C.I.C.
A.T.T.W.O. reports S.C.A.T. team manned and ready at all crew-served weapon stations port and starboard.
Jeter:
All right, let's move.
- Fan out.
- Aye, sir.
Secure a perimeter.
Dennis and Rowler, left flank.
Cruz, you take right.
Keep your hands on the swivel, fellas.
[Man speaks indistinctly]
Man:
Perimeter secure.
Man:
Keep eyes on upper structures.
Copy.
Slattery:
Here they come.
[Men speaking indistinctly]
Hi!
Hey.
I'm Lieutenant Pete Norris of the Maryland state police.
Inside my vehicles are my assistant barrack commander, my criminal section supervisor, and a few surviving state troopers.
You don't need the masks.
We're not sick.
I'm Lieutenant Green, this is Lieutenant Burk.
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lieutenant.
Bridge, Burk.
The pier is secure.
- All clear, over.
- [Radio static]
Understand.
All clear on the beach.
- Landing party underway.
- [Radio chirps]
- Welcome to Baltimore. [Laughs]
- Hey, it's great to be here.
Looks like the troopers just got themselves a couple hundred U.S. sailors.
A few dozen tomahawks, too.
Looks like a landing party arriving.
Thorwald:
Including the Captain.
You must be Lieutenant Norris.
Tom Chandler, C.O., Nathan James.
Pleasure to meet you.
This is Lieutenant Landau.
Ma'am.
Sir.
Hey.
How y'all doin'?
Just fine, now that you're here.
We can escort you guys back to our H.Q.
Thorwald:
Here comes another van.
Man:
Cobra 1 in place.
All clear on the beach.
[Engine turns off, doors close]
Holy shit.
What?
- [Voice breaking]
- Mom?
I had to come see for myself.
Oh, my baby girl.
It's her.
It's Granderson.
She came out herself.
I am so glad to have you back.
Captain Chandler, thank you.
Thank you for returning my daughter to me.
Privilege, ma'am.
We wouldn't be here without her.
Take the shot.
Mrs. Granderson, we really need to get you back in the vehicle.
She's blocked.
Come.
Everyone's eager to meet you.
I can take out the fat man.
No!
You only have one shot.
- I want her.
- Danny:
Nathan James, looks like we're having a bit of a family reunion here.
We're headed out with the group.
Sending Lieutenant Norris back with the V.B.S.S.
To update you on the situation on the ground, sir.
Roger that.
We'll arrange a welcome for Lieutenant Norris.
Oh, and say "hi" to Mom for us.
Damn it!
I lost her.
Talk to your friends on the inside.
Find out what they're doing here.
[Click]
- Man:
Let's go!
- [Dog barking in distance]
[Doors close]
We were fortunate to find this building.
There's only one coal-fired plant still operational, and we have a direct line.
Plus, strategically we're far enough from the city to avoid infection.
You'll be safe here.
Come.
Mom, this is amazing.
Oh, yes, but it's been a battle.
And who's the enemy?
Warlords, they call themselves.
And recently, they've killed more people than the actual virus.
Do you know they raided the National Archives?
They actually tried to steal original copies of the Constitution.
As if that could take away who we are as a people.
Captain.
I didn't want to broadcast about the virus over an open radio feed, but...
The President told me that you had the materials to produce a vaccine.
Is that true?
Yes, ma'am.
We've actually made a little more progress than that,
Mrs. Granderson.
[Inhales sharply]
We have the cure.
Fort Detrick was our first option, too.
They had the lab and all, but, uh,
- Thorwald got there first.
- Thorwald.
Former Baltimore P.D. turned self-proclaimed leader of the Warlords.
Been a real pain in our ass since this whole thing started.
I shouldn't complain. [Chuckles]
I imagine you've been through a hell of a time yourselves.
Listen, Lieutenant, last I talked to my wife, she said was taking the family to Deer Park.
Safe zone.
Heard of it.
You know if it's still there?
There was fighting, but there are survivors.
I can get you there as soon as we get you off the ship.
- [Click, hiss]
- Ooh!
Thanks, Doc.
You have no idea how good that felt.
Well, I have some idea.
- Yeah.
- [Click]
Man:
What were the results of the test...
[Speaks indistinctly]
See, these results are consistent...
Now this is the main reason we chose this building.
[Speaking indistinctly]
We've worked for months trying to develop a cure.
But now you're here.
[Exhales] It's heavenly.
[Clapping]
- [Door opens]
- You're not gonna like this, boss.
My guy inside Granderson's said the ship came back with a cure.
It could be bullshit.
We've heard this before.
Not from the U.S. Navy.
If that's true, Granderson will spread out, go anywhere she wants.
We will lose the city.
We need to get our hands on the cure.
It's probably locked away somewhere on the ship.
The only way is to take Granderson on directly.
We have to take her lab.
Rachel:
Extraordinary.
- Look at her.
- [Speaks indistinctly]
She's in love with a toaster.
You still haven't made your move yet?
Oh, I've been making my move since Gitmo.
She ain't buying what I'm selling.
I thought once she saved the world,
- she'd let loose a little.
- [Chuckles]
Jeter:
Nathan James, this is Vulture One.
Do you copy?
[Lowered voice] This is her letting loose.
I repeat...
Nathan James, this is Vulture One.
Do you copy?
I can't get through, sir.
You won't get a signal here, Master Chief.
The Warlords are jamming the local frequencies.
They have a radio room, sir.
I let the X.O. know where we are.
Ma'am, uh, if that radio room is still available,
I'd like to get word to my family, see if they're still out there.
I think it's time you thought of yourself.
Meanwhile, we can work with your team to arrange safe transit here for your ship's crew.
- Due to warlord activity...
- This is Tom Chandler, listening on a spread spectrum, looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater, Virginia,
- or parts nearby, over.
- Citizens are advised to avoid these areas until further notice.
This is Tom Chandler, listening on a spread spectrum, looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater, Virginia, or parts nearby, over.
And some city services are set to resume.

This is Tom Chandler, looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater, Virginia, over. [Clicks]
[Sighs deeply]
Howdy.
Tex.
Hey, listen, just wanted to let you know that I'm heading off.
- Heading off?
- Mm-hmm.
[Huffs] What are you talking about?
I'm moving on.
By yourself?
But it's chaos out there.
I've seen worse.
And thanks to you, I can travel wherever I like.
Where will you go?
I, uh, got things to take care of.
The young girl whose picture that you keep in your locket.
Among other things, yeah.
Anyway, you seem to have things plenty well in hand here.
Right then.
[Chuckles, breathes sharply]
Oh, you're a special woman, you know that?
You take care now.
[Mutters] What the hell.
[Door closes]
[Exhales]
This is Tom Chandler, looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater, Virginia, over.

This is Tom Chandler, U.S. Navy, looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater, Virginia, over.
- Tom?
- Dad?
Dad?
Are you there?
It's me.
It's Tom.
I'm back!
- Tom?
- I'm here, Dad.
- Tommy?
[Coughing] - [Sighs]
[Static crackling]
Are you at the cabin?
- We're going to... [Coughs] Baltimore.
- Baltimore?
!
Are you with the kids?
!
Darien?
!
[Pants] We're sick.
We had to leave the cabin.
[Coughing] Going to Olympia.
It's our only hope for a cure...
Come quick.
We're sick!
Tell me exactly where you are.
What do you see?
- Onyx truck stop.
- Truck stop?
- What happened?
Are you on the road?
- Onyx truck stop.
- It's a tire shop downtown.
- We can get you there.
Listen to me.
Stay put.
I'm coming for you.
Put these jackets on.
You'll blend in better.
We're in and out, gentlemen.
[Tires screeching]
Dad!
Dad?
- Burk:
Let's get eyes. 360.
- Darien?
[Men speaking indistinctly]
Dad?

Darien?

- Where did you get this radio?
- [Coughs]
- Where did you get this radio?
!
Answer me!
- It's mine now.
The man you took this radio from, where did he go?
!
Man, everybody's going to the same place...
Where did he go?
!
- The arena!
- Where?
!
What arena?
!
- Olympia!
[Coughs]
- Olympia.
Come on!
Let's go!
- Can't do that, sir.
- What do you mean?
Olympia's off-limits.
It's for sick people.
But we're immune.
You got the shots, too.
Get back in the car.
We're going back to base.
- We're going to Olympia.
- You don't give the orders, Captain.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Get back in the cars!
- Whoa!
- Drop your weapons!
- Get back in the car!
- Drop your weapons!
You don't want to do this, trooper!
We're on the same side!
- Everybody calm down!
- [Gun cocks]
Aah!
Aah!
Master Chief!
I'm all right!
I'm okay.
Nathan James, this is Vulture Two.
Come in!
- Damn it, still can't get through!
- [Tires screech]
Take the truck, get the Master Chief back to the ship.
- And tell the X.O. what's going on!
- What is going on?
!
Find a way to get the others back to the ship.
We're getting out of Baltimore.
- [Engine starts]
- You okay?
What about us?
We're going to Olympia.
You'll inform the others then?
Very good.
- [Hangs up telephone]
- Everything okay?
Yeah.
All good.
I want to try and look for Sarah.
I-if you survived, there's a chance that maybe she's still okay.
Alisha...
Your friend lived in Wisconsin.
There's no way to get there now.
[Pouring coffee]
- Soon, maybe.
- But if we make...
Soon.
Now...
Tell me this...
What kind of man is Captain Chandler?
He's amazing.
Without him, we wouldn't have gotten through any of this.
So he hasn't the let the power go to his head?
I'm not sure I understand the question.
I'm asking if he will still follow orders.
Follow orders from whom?
Mother, what's going on?
Michael, have you seen these protocols?
Of course.
Why?
Well, Dr. Hamada claims that his treatment prolongs the lives of the infected.
But his whole assumption about the virus seems to be wrong.
[Huffs] I'm just a statistician, but the data he's given me suggests
- the treatment's working.
- No, that's impossible.
- Is something wrong?
- Dr. Hamada, you're using ribavirin to introduce higher error rates to the virus' D.N.A. replication.
In a chemical cocktail, yes.
Yes, but the pandemic virus is error-free.
Your treatment wouldn't have any positive effect whatsoever.
In fact, these dose levels are highly toxic.
Um...
[Indistinct chatter over P.A.]
[Turnstiles clacking]
Man:
Go through the turnstile and wait for assessment.
[Indistinct conversations, chatter over P.A. continues]

Where's mommy?

A little pinch.
This is gonna make you feel better.
- Ahh!
[Whines]
- Tommy...
Where is she?
Son, I'm sorry.
Dad, where's Darien?
!
She's gone, son.
She's gone.
[Crying]
I tried to do everything I could to save her.
I tried.
I tried.
I know you did, Pop.
I know you did.
But right now I gotta give you this.
[Gasps]
[Sobbing]
Slattery:
You stack the cases by the hangar door, we'll put 'em on a pallet and unload 'em dockside as soon as we make port.
I'm not sure exactly when that's gonna be...
Oh, hey, Norris, answer a question for us if you could.
Yes, sir.
- Hey!
- Whoa!
Whoa!
Commander.
Commander!
I want you to get on the horn and give the order to drop anchor.
You muster your entire crew on the flight deck and you open up the door to the helo bay where you're storing the cure.
I'm not giving you a goddamn thing, you son of a bitch.
I don't know what your plan is here,
- but this is my ship!
- You'll do exactly what I say, or I'll pick off your entire crew one-by-one.
My troopers are everywhere.
This ship is mine now.
- Please, he needs help.
- Hey...
- Call Doc Rios!
- Nobody moves!
- [Shouting indistinctly]
- Nobody moves!
Put down that weapon!
Everyone heard that gunshot.
- They're gonna come running.
- You don't think I'll do it, X.O.?
!
- Put down that weapon!
- You think I won't do it, X.O.?
Just try me!
- [Gunshot]
- Ahh!
- No!
- Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahh!
I'm not gonna tell you again, Commander.
Muster your crew.
- [Exhales] - [Door opens]
Doctor.
My troopers say they experienced no side effects from the cure.
It's amazing what you've created.
I wish I could say the same in return.
I understand you have some questions about the way we've been treating the sick.
What you are giving the sick is anything but a treatment...
Of that I am sure.
Doctor...
You know this.
In the 14th century, the Black Death wiped out 60% of the European population.
The plague killed indiscriminately...
The artists, scientists, thinkers, so few and precious to begin with, were wiped out.
It upended the social order and prolonged the dark ages 150 years.
I cannot let that happen here.
[Breathing erratically]
Granderson:
I understand your allegiance to your friends.
You've gone through so much together.
But you've seen nothing of the chaos here at home.
The hysteria, the cruelty, the savagery.
You must try to see the situation from our point of view.
There are people out there who would use this crisis to take what does not belong to them.
They are the barbarians at the gate who would send us into a new dark age.
We have the power to stop them, to keep them in their place.
It is my duty to help the right people first, the people whose survival will ensure the future of our entire society...
And all that we hold dear.
So you gather your elite few within these walls.
And the rest...
What happens to them?
The virus doesn't discriminate.
That unfortunate task falls to me.
[Indistinct chatter over P.A.]
[Man coughs in distance]
[Clicks]
Pl... [Breathing erratically]
Plea... plea...
Please...
[Whimpering]
[Gasping]
Hey, what are you doing?
You can't be here!
You're killing them.
Get the hell back behind the curtain!
- You're killing them!
- Stay back!
- You sick bastards!
- Man:
Hey, you can't be here!
[Gunfire]
Captain, we gotta move!
Man:
Security breach in section 12.
Repeat... security breach in section 12.
[Truck engine revving]
I don't...
I don't...
I don't get it.
They're burning 'em.
They're burning the bodies to power the city.
- [Clicks]
- I know it's hard to understand.
You've been away so long.
But in time, Rachel, you'll see it's the only way.
She was trying to run.
Dr. Scott, I swear I had no idea this was happening.
- I swear...
- Hush, dear.
You can't replicate my work with the doses that I've given you.
Everything that you need is locked up on that ship.
And the Captain will never give it up.
You let me worry about the Captain.
Daddy...
We have to go.
- [Radio static]
- Nathan James, come in.
Do you read me?
[Radio static crackling]
Nathan James, come in.
Do you read me?
Nathan James, this is the Captain.
Come in.

We're sick.
I'm broadcasting in the blind.

Wake up, mama, please!

What's your name?

You sure you have enough for the whole crew?
And 50 or 60 more.
When we get home,
We can use this as a vaccine and a cure?
The uninfected will be immunized, and...
The sick can be cured,
Providing they're not too far gone.
After all the failures and the false starts,
I just feel so --
Happy?
[ exhales sharply ]
I can't truly remember the last time
That I felt that emotion.
Still so much to do.
We have to mass produce it,
We have to distribute it.
Thank god -- rachel...
You did it.
Let's enjoy the moment.
I told her how I feel.
I mean... [ exhales ]
Basically spilled my guts to her.
I mean, sure, I'm spiking a 104-degree fever,
But still.
"you make me wanna love again."
I actually said that.
And what does she give me?
Zip.
What I understand about women, you fit in a shot glass.
I don't need to tell you.
[ whines ] [ indistinct conversations ]
Hey, how are you feeling?
I don't get seasick, so... [ exhales ]
I've never seen morning sickness on a d.D.G. Before.
[ exhales ] have you seen a nursery?
[ chuckles ] no.
[ door opens ] form up.
[ sighs ]
Okay, here's the deal.
We are presently attempting to make contact
With the infectious disease lab at fort detrick,
As it has just the facility dr.
Scott requires
For mass producing the cure.
So far we've had no joy.
I'll be honest --
Knowing how deadly this plague is and how fast it spreads,
I don't have any confidence
That there's gonna be any survivors, so...
That being said,
There's a reason they call it a fort.
And if anyone can hold their own,
It's our friends in the u.S. Army.
Master chief.
Thank you, sir.
I want to address the issue that's on all of our minds.
On our way up the coast,
Our ship will be passing right by norfolk -- by home.
And our comms team tells us we could pick up
Some orphan signals from random cell towers
Or servers still online.
You may even get a phone call
If they've restored power on land.
It's unlikely, but I just wanna prepare you.
We don't know what to expect when we get back to the states.
The only way to help the people we love
Is to deliver dr.
Scott and the cure
To a secure and workable lab.
Detrick's our best bet, so that's our mission.
All:
Aye, sir.
Carry on.
Any station in this net vicinity
Of fort detrick u.S.A.M.R.I.I.D.,
This is u.S.S. Nathan james, over.
Aye, sir.
Captain, s.S.E.S. Reports that the keyhole satellite
Will be flying over our whiskey in 50 seconds.
Unable to steer,
But they did manage to break the uplink/downlink encryption.
Bringing up the feed now.
[ beeping ] [ exhales deeply ] it's traveling fast.
Too fast, sir.
There's no one left at home to control it.
When it gets over the area,
We'll have less than a minute to capture the images we can.
We just need enough to chart a clear route
From the land to the lab.
We've tapped into one of the air force's spy satellites
To check the traffic to fort detrick.
Well, why not send your helicopter or drone?
No more fuel.
They spent it all looking for me.
Kara:
Satellite passing over us.
[ static ]
Mason:
Any station...
Come on, give us something.
There it is.
[ beeps ]
Home.
That's interstate 70.
If it's clear, it'll get us all the way to detrick.
There'll be some image blur, but I'll get you closer, sir.
[ clicks ]
That's a mass evacuation.
Take us north a mile.
Aye, sir.
[ typing ]
Any station this net vicinity of fort detrick u.S.A.M.R.I.I.D.,
This is u.S.S. Nathan james...
That red "x" -- some sort of quarantine?
More like a warning sign to stay away.
Looks like people took it seriously.
Sir, the satellite's approaching fort detrick.
I say again,
Anyone at fort detrick, please respond.
The laboratory building's in the center of campus.
Roger that, ma'am.
Zooming in.
[ whispers ] oh, my god.
[ normal voice ] it's been completely destroyed.
The lab, the containment areas, the equipment, everything.
Nothing else on the base was burned.
That lab was targeted.
Who would've done that?
Slow down!
Slow down!
Stop the car.
Where you goin'?
My family's sick.
They need help.
Can't go this way.
Turn around.
Please.
Please, we're just trying --
Trying to get to olympia.
Olympia can't help you.
Go back where you came from, old man.
[ window whirs ]
Get down.
[ shifts gear ] [ gasps ] [ engine revs, tires screech ] [ children scream ] [ gunshots ] [ machine gunfire in distance ] [ engine revs, tires screech ] [ man shouts indistinctly ]
Should we go after 'em?
No.
They'll be dead soon.
Sir!
Sir!
Take a breath.
What is it?
I caught a new broadcast.
It's another loop.
But this one was updated today.
And there's something you need to hear.
Woman:
Winds are coming out of the southwest,
And temperatures will reach 50 degrees in baltimore...
How come we're just hearing this now?
Probably a weak f.M. Transmitter, sir.
It must've just come into range.
There are reports of a fresh outbreak of the red flu
In sector 9.
"red flu."
Is that what they're calling it?
Doesn't do it justice somehow.
It's looping around.
Here it comes.
U.S.S. Nathan james, we are aware of your mission
And we have secured the facility you may require.
If you are within range of this signal,
We urge you to reply over channel 1-6.
I repeat, u.S.S. Nathan james, if you are still out there,
Please reply on v.H.F. Channel 1-6.
Get them on the line.
Yes, sir.
This is u.S. Naval warship nathan james
Hailing you on channel 1-6.
We have heard your call, over.
This is u.S. Naval warship nathan james
Hailing you on channel 1-6.
We have heard your call, over.
Baltimore.
We should set a course in that direction.
Agreed.
[ door closes ] we may still be too far out.
You let me know as soon as you find out.
Good work, son.
[ door alert dinging ] schools have reopened in sector 3,
And some city services are set to resume.
[ coughs ]
Attention, attention,
This call goes out to the crew of the u.S.S. Nathan james.
We are aware of your mission
And we have secured the facility you may require.
If you are in range of the signal,
We urge you to reply over channel 1-6.
I repeat -- u.S.S. Nathan james,
If you are still out there...
Jed?
Did you hear that, darien?
Tom's still out there.
People are waiting for him.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
You're gonna make it.
You hang in there.
[ keys jangle ] [ engine sputters, turns over ]
Quincy:
I had to do what was best -- [ door opens ]
Kelly:
Best for whom?
Please listen to that.
Rachel:
Ava?
Kelly:
We have been through it.
They're at it again.
Quincy:
You know that I love you.
Events -- they just happen on a mind of their own...
I know that things are better now.
But...
I don't think they'll be the same again.
Hello, kelly.
Hi.
Ava, darling, shall we go and find something to eat?
All right.
I'll see you later.
I'll see you later.
Bye.
She can't forgive me for what I put them through.
To be honest, I don't blame her.
Well, when the captain finds the right place
For us to put ashore,
Maybe you can all start again
On more solid ground.
Captain, I've got baltimore.
A mrs.
Granderson is on the line.
Did you say granderson?
Yes, sir.
Well, put her through.
They're trying to use the vidcom,
But so far it can only get audio, sir.
Go ahead, sir.
This is tom chandler,
Commanding officer of the u.S.S. Nathan james, over.
Captain chandler.
You have no idea how good it is to hear your voice.
We thought you were lost at sea.
No, ma'am, we're alive and well.
Oh!
There you are.
I got it.
You must be nearby.
I'm amy granderson.
And I suppose an explanation is in order.
As vice-chair of
The president's defense policy board,
I was briefed on your mission to the arctic.
I knew the risks of the coming pandemic,
And I had my daughter transferred to your ship.
You must forgive me.
No apology needed, ma'am.
Your daughter's been an incredible asset.
Pleased to hear from you.
We had no word from the presidential bunker.
President geller invited me underground.
I declined.
I-I felt the risk was too big
To have so much of our civilian and military command
In one confined space.
Unfortunately, I was right.
So the government is gone.
For the most part, yes.
Since the bunker went silent,
There has been a breakdown of infrastructure,
General panic, and, of course, a tremendous loss of life.
I have tried to execute a contingency plan
Working with the state and local police
To create safe zones.
We have been hanging on as best we can.
And I have been praying every day for your return.
Ma'am, we can be in baltimore in the matter of hours.
In the meantime,
I'm sure there is someone you'd like to speak with.
Mom?
Alisha!
Mom, I don't -- I don't understand --
What are you doing?
Where are you?
I'm here, darling.
Oh, I knew you were out there.
I just knew it.
Thorwald.
[ water splashing ]
We've intercepted a transmission.
A u.S. Navy ship is due to make port in a matter of hours
In baltimore harbor.
What kind of ship?
I don't know, sir.
Well, is it a tug?
A destroyer?
A 5,000-sailor aircraft carrier?
The signal was spotty.
All we know is the name.
Nathan james.
It's the ship they've been hailing for weeks.
Granderson's sending out a greeting party.
Well, if they're having a party...
Then let's party.
Man:
We are cleared, baltimore.
[ speaks indistinctly ] ...The port distance 1,000 yards.
No threats, no contact.
Man:
All commands reporting...
[ speaks indistinctly ]
Man:
V.B.S.S. On the way to designated meeting point.
Kara:
E.W. Reports negative rackets of interest.
Nothing moving on surface plot.
Clean picture.
Bridge?
C.I.C.
A.T.T.W.O. Reports s.C.A.T. Team manned and ready
At all crew-served weapon stations port and starboard.
Jeter:
All right, let's move.
Fan out.
Aye, sir.
Secure a perimeter.
Dennis and rowler, left flank.
Cruz, you take right.
Keep your hands on the swivel, fellas.
[ man speaks indistinctly ]
Man:
Perimeter secure.
Man:
Keep eyes on upper structures.
Copy.
Slattery:
Here they come.
[ men speaking indistinctly ]
Hi!
Hey.
I'm lieutenant pete norris of the maryland state police.
Inside my vehicles are my assistant barrack commander,
My criminal section supervisor,
And a few surviving state troopers.
You don't need the masks.
We're not sick.
I'm lieutenant green, this is lieutenant burk.
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, lieutenant.
[ chuckles ]
Bridge, burk.
The pier is secure.
All clear, over.
[ radio static ]
Understand.
All clear on the beach.
Landing party underway.
[ radio chirps ]
Welcome to baltimore.
[ laughs ] hey, it's great to be here.
Looks like the troopers just got themselves
A couple hundred u.S. Sailors.
A few dozen tomahawks, too.
Looks like a landing party arriving.
Thorwald:
Including the captain.
You must be lieutenant norris.
Tom chandler, c.O., nathan james.
Pleasure to meet you.
This is lieutenant landau.
Ma'am.
Sir.
Hey.
How y'all doin'?
Just fine, now that you're here.
We can escort you guys back to our h.Q.
Thorwald:
Here comes another van.
Man:
Cobra 1 in place.
All clear on the beach.
[ engine turns off, doors close ]
Holy shit.
What?
[ voice breaking ] mom?
I had to come see for myself.
Oh, my baby girl.
It's her.
It's granderson.
She came out herself.
I am so glad to have you back.
Captain chandler, thank you.
Thank you for returning my daughter to me.
Privilege, ma'am.
We wouldn't be here without her.
Take the shot.
Mrs. Granderson,
We really need to get you back in the vehicle.
She's blocked.
Come.
Everyone's eager to meet you.
I can take out the fat man.
No!
You only have one shot.
I want her.
Danny:
Nathan james,
Looks like we're having a bit of a family reunion here.
We're headed out with the group.
Sending lieutenant norris back with the v.B.S.S.
To update you on the situation on the ground, sir.
Roger that.
We'll arrange a welcome for lieutenant norris.
Oh, and say "hi" to mom for us.
Damn it!
I lost her.
Talk to your friends on the inside.
Find out what they're doing here.
[ click ]
Man:
Let's go!
[ dog barking in distance ]
[ doors close ]
We were fortunate to find this building.
There's only one coal-fired plant still operational,
And we have a direct line.
Plus, strategically we're far enough from the city
To avoid infection.
You'll be safe here.
Come.
Mom, this is amazing.
Oh, yes, but it's been a battle.
And who's the enemy?
Warlords, they call themselves.
And recently, they've killed
More people than the actual virus.
Do you know they raided the national archives?
They actually tried to steal
Original copies of the constitution.
As if that could take away who we are as a people.
Captain.
I didn't want to broadcast about the virus
Over an open radio feed, but...
The president told me that you had the materials
To produce a vaccine.
Is that true?
Yes, ma'am.
We've actually made a little more progress than that,
Mrs. Granderson.
[ inhales sharply ]
We have the cure.
Fort detrick was our first option, too.
They had the lab and all, but, uh,
Thorwald got there first.
Thorwald.
Former baltimore p.D. Turned self-proclaimed leader
Of the warlords.
Been a real pain in our ass since this whole thing started.
I shouldn't complain.
[ chuckles ]
I imagine you've been through a hell of a time yourselves.
Listen, lieutenant, last I talked to my wife,
She said was taking the family to deer park.
Safe zone.
Heard of it.
You know if it's still there?
There was fighting, but there are survivors.
I can get you there as soon as we get you off the ship.
[ click, hiss ] ooh!
Thanks, doc.
You have no idea how good that felt.
Well, I have some idea.
Yeah.
[ click ]
Man:
What were the results of the test... [ speaks indistinctly ]
See, these results are consistent...
Now this is the main reason we chose this building.
[ speaking indistinctly ]
We've worked for months trying to develop a cure.
But now you're here.
[ exhales ] it's heavenly.
[ clapping ]
[ door opens ] you're not gonna like this, boss.
My guy inside granderson's said the ship came back with a cure.
It could be bullshit.
We've heard this before.
Not from the u.S. Navy.
If that's true, granderson will spread out,
Go anywhere she wants.
We will lose the city.
We need to get our hands on the cure.
It's probably locked away somewhere on the ship.
The only way is to take granderson on directly.
We have to take her lab.
Rachel:
Extraordinary.
Look at her.
[ speaks indistinctly ]
She's in love with a toaster.
You still haven't made your move yet?
Oh, I've been making my move since gitmo.
She ain't buying what I'm selling.
I thought once she saved the world,
She'd let loose a little.
[ chuckles ]
Jeter:
Nathan james, this is vulture one.
Do you copy?
[ lowered voice ] this is her letting loose.
I repeat -- nathan james, this is vulture one.
Do you copy?
I can't get through, sir.
You won't get a signal here, master chief.
The warlords are jamming the local frequencies.
They have a radio room, sir.
I let the x.O. Know where we are.
Ma'am, uh, if that radio room is still available,
I'd like to get word to my family,
See if they're still out there.
I think it's time you thought of yourself.
Meanwhile, we can work with your team
To arrange safe transit here for your ship's crew.
Due to warlord activity...
This is tom chandler,
Listening on a spread spectrum,
Looking for jed chandler in clearwater, virginia,
Or parts nearby, over.
Citizens are advised
To avoid these areas until further notice.
Power has been...

Howdy.
Tex.
Hey, listen, just wanted to let you know
That I'm heading off.
Heading off?
Mm-hmm.
[ huffs ] what are you talking about?
I'm moving on.
By yourself?
But it's chaos out there.
I've seen worse.
And thanks to you, I can travel wherever I like.
Where will you go?
I, uh, got things to take care of.
The young girl whose picture that you keep in your locket.
Among other things, yeah.
Anyway, you seem to have things plenty well in hand here.
Right then.
[ chuckles, breathes sharply ]
Oh, you're a special woman, you know that?
You take care now.
[ mutters ] what the hell.
[ door closes ] [ exhales ]
This is tom chandler, looking for jed chandler

Tom?

Dad?
Are you there?
It's me.
It's tom.
I'm back!
Tom?
I'm here, dad.
Tommy?
[ coughing ] [ sighs ] [ static crackling ]
Are you at the cabin?
We're going to...
[ coughs ] baltimore.
Baltimore?
!
Are you with the kids?
!
Darien?
!
[ pants ] we're sick.
We had to leave the cabin.
[ coughing ] going to olympia.
It's our only hope for a cure --
Come quick.
We're sick!
Tell me exactly where you are.
What do you see?
Onyx truck stop.
Truck stop?
What happened?
Are you on the road?
Onik truck stop.
It's a tire shop downtown.
We can get you there.
Listen to me.
Stay put.
I'm coming for you.
Put these jackets on.
You'll blend in better.
We're in and out, gentlemen.
[ tires screeching ]
Dad!
Dad?
Burk:
Let's get eyes. 360.
Darien?

Dad?

Darien?

Where did you get this radio?
[ coughs ]
Where did you get this radio?
!
Answer me!
It's mine now.
The man you took this radio from, where did he go?
!
[ mutters, coughs ]
Man, everybody's going to the same place -- where did he go?
!
The arena!
Where?
!
What arena?
!
Olympia!
[ coughs ] olympia.
Come on!
Let's go!
Can't do that, sir.
What do you mean?
Olympia's off-limits.
It's for sick people.
But we're immune.
You got the shots, too.
Get back in the car.
We're going back to base.
We're going to olympia.
You don't give the orders, captain.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Get back in the cars!
Whoa!
Drop your weapons!
Get back in the car!
Drop your weapons!
You don't want to do this, trooper!
We're on the same side!
Everybody calm down!
[ gun cocks ]
Aah!
Aah!
Master chief!
I'm all right!
I'm okay.
Nathan james, this is vulture two.
Come in!
Damn it, still can't get through!
[ tires screech ]
Take the truck, get the master chief back to the ship.
And tell the x.O. What's going on!
What is going on?
!
Find a way to get the others back to the ship.
We're getting out of baltimore.
[ engine starts ] you okay?
What about us?
We're going to olympia.
You'll inform the others then?
Very good.
[ hangs up telephone ] everything okay?
Yeah.
All good.
I want to try and look for sarah.
I-if you survived, there's a chance
That maybe she's still okay.
Alisha...
Your friend lived in wisconsin.
There's no way to get there now.
[ pouring coffee ]
Soon, maybe.
But if we make --
Soon.
Now...
Tell me this --
What kind of man is captain chandler?
He's amazing.
Without him, we wouldn't have gotten through any of this.
So he hasn't the let the power go to his head?
I'm not sure I understand the question.
I'm asking if he will still follow orders.
Follow orders from whom?
Mother, what's going on?
[ equipment whirring ]
Michael, have you seen these protocols?
Of course.
Why?
Well, dr.
Hamada claims that his treatment
Prolongs the lives of the infected.
But his whole assumption about the virus
Seems to be wrong.
[ huffs ] I'm just a statistician,
But the data he's given me suggests
The treatment's working.
No, that's impossible.
Is something wrong?
Dr. Hamada,
You're using ribavirin to introduce
Higher error rates to the virus' d.N.A. Replication.
In a chemical cocktail, yes.
Yes, but the pandemic virus is error-free.
Your treatment wouldn't have any positive effect whatsoever.
In fact, these dose levels are highly toxic.
Um... [ indistinct chatter over p.A. ]
[ turnstiles clacking ]
Man:
Go through the turnstile and wait for assessment.
[ indistinct conversations, chatter over p.A. Continues ]
[ child crying in distance ] [ indistinct conversations ]
Daddy?

Daddy...
We're sick.
I know, baby.
I know.
Daddy's gonna make it better, okay?

Where's mommy?
[ panting ] tommy...
Where's your mother?
[ crying ] [ gasps, whines ]
Tommy -- dad, why didn't you wait for me?
[ crying ] sam, a little pinch.
A little pinch.
This is gonna make you feel better.
Ahh!
[ whines ] tommy --
Where is she?
Son, I'm sorry.
Dad, where's darien?
!
She's gone, son.
She's gone.
[ crying ]
I tried to do everything I could to save her.
I tried.
I tried.
I know you did, pop.
I know you did.
But right now I gotta give you this.
[ gasps ] [ sobbing ]
Slattery:
You stack the cases by the hangar door,
We'll put 'em on a pallet and unload 'em dockside
As soon as we make port.
I'm not sure exactly when that's gonna be --
Oh, hey, norris, answer a question for us if you could.
Yes, sir.
Hey!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Commander.
Commander!
I want you to get on the horn
And give the order to drop anchor.
You muster your entire crew on the flight deck
And you open up the door to the helo bay
Where you're storing the cure.
I'm not giving you a goddamn thing, you son of a bitch.
I don't know what your plan is here, but this is my ship!
You'll do exactly what I say,
Or I'll pick off your entire crew one-by-one.
My troopers are everywhere.
This ship is mine now.
Please, he needs help.
Hey --
Call doc rios!
Nobody moves!
[ shouting indistinctly ] nobody moves!
Put down that weapon!
Everyone heard that gunshot.
They're gonna come running.
You don't think I'll do it, x.O.?
!
Put down that weapon!
You think I won't do it, x.O.?
Just try me!
[ gunshot ] ahh!
No!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahh!
I'm not gonna tell you again, commander.
Muster your crew.
[ exhales ] [ door opens ]
Doctor.
My troopers say they experienced no side effects
From the cure.
It's amazing what you've created.
I wish I could say the same in return.
I understand you have some questions
About the way we've been treating the sick.
What you are giving the sick
Is anything but a treatment -- of that I am sure.
Doctor...
You know this.
In the 14th century, the black death
Wiped out 60% of the european population.
The plague killed indiscriminately --
The artists, scientists, thinkers,
So few and precious to begin with,
Were wiped out.
It upended the social order
And prolonged the dark ages 150 years.
I cannot let that happen here.
[ breathing erratically ]
Granderson:
I understand your allegiance to your friends.
You've gone through so much together.
But you've seen nothing of the chaos here at home.
The hysteria,
The cruelty, the savagery.
You must try to see the situation
From our point of view.
There are people out there who would use this crisis
To take what does not belong to them.
They are the barbarians at the gate
Who would send us into a new dark age.
We have the power to stop them,
To keep them in their place.
It is my duty to help the right people first,
The people whose survival will ensure
The future of our entire society...
And all that we hold dear.
So you gather your elite few
Within these walls.
And the rest --
What happens to them?
The virus doesn't discriminate.
That unfortunate task falls to me.
[ indistinct chatter over p.A. ]
[ man coughs in distance ] [ clicks ]
Pl-- [ breathing erratically ]
Plea-- plea--
Please... [ whimpering ] [ gasping ]
Hey, what are you doing?
You can't be here!
You're killing them.
Get the hell back behind the curtain!
You're killing them!
Stay back!
You sick bastards!
Man:
Hey, you can't be here!
[ gunfire ]
Captain, we gotta move!
Man:
Security breach in section 12.
Repeat -- security breach in section 12.
[ truck engine revving ]
I don't -
- I don't -- I don't get it.
They're burning 'em.
They're burning the bodies to power the city.
[ clicks ] I know it's hard to understand.
You've been away so long.
But in time, rachel, you'll see it's the only way.
She was trying to run.
Dr. Scott, I swear I had no idea this was happening.
I swear -- hush, dear.
You can't replicate my work
With the doses that I've given you.
Everything that you need is locked up on that ship.
And the captain will never give it up.
You let me worry about the captain.
Daddy...
We have to go.
[ radio static ] nathan james, come in.
Do you read me?
[ radio static crackling ]
Nathan james, come in.
Do you read me?
Nathan james, this is the captain.
Come in.
Do you read me?
[ whirring ]
Chandler:
Nathan james, come in.
Do you read me?
Nathan james, this is the captain.
Come in.
Do you read me?
Nathan james, where are you?
Come in, anyone.
Anybody out there?
We're sick.
I'm broadcasting in the blind.
Mama?
Mama?
- In the blind!
- Mama, please don't fall asleep.
Mama, we're gonna get you help.
- Wake up, Mama, please!
- Anyone, come in, please.
Anyone out there?
Anyone, damn it!
Mama, please don't fall asleep.
Wake up, Mama.
Mama!
What's your name?
Ripped By mstoll
You sure you have enough for the whole crew?
And 50 or 60 more.
When we get home, we can use this as a vaccine and a cure?
Well, the uninfected will be immunized and the sick can be cured providing they're not too far gone.
After all the failures and the false starts I just feel so--
Happy?
I can't remember the last time that I felt that emotion.
Still so much to do.
We have to mass-produce it we have to distribute it.
My God.
- Rachel.
You did it.
Let's enjoy the moment.
I told her how I feel.
I mean, basically, I spilled my guts to her.
I mean, sure, I'm spiking a hundred-and-four-degree fever but still, you know.
"You make me wanna love again."
I actually said that.
And what does she give me?
Zip.
What I understand about women, you'd fit in a shot glass.
I don't need to tell you.
Hey, how are you feeling?
I don't get seasick, so...
I've never seen morning sickness on a DDG before.
Have you seen a nursery?
No.
Form up.
Okay, here's the deal.
We're attempting to make contact with the infectious disease lab at Fort Detrick as it is just the facility Dr. Scott requires for mass-producing the cure.
So far we've had no joy.
I'll be honest knowing how deadly this plague is and how fast it spreads I don't have any confidence that there's gonna be any survivors, so...
That being said, there's a reason they call it a fort.
And if anyone can hold their own it's our friends in the U.S. Army.
- Master chief.
- Thank you, sir.
I wanna address the issue that's on all of our minds.
On our way up the coast, our ship will be passing right by Norfolk.
By home.
Our comms team tells us we could pick up some orphan signals from random cell towers or servers still online.
You may even get a phone call if they've restored power on land.
It's unlikely, but I just wanna prepare you.
We don't know what to expect when we get back to the States.
Only way to help the people we love is to deliver Dr. Scott and the cure to a secure and workable lab.
Detrick's our best bet, so that's our mission.
- Aye, sir.
- Carry on.
Any station in vicinity of Fort Detrick USAMRIID, this is U.S.S. Nathan James, over.
Aye, sir.
Captain, SSES reports that the keyhole satellite will be flying over our whiskey in 50 seconds.
Unable to steer but they did manage to break the uplink encryption.
Bringing up the feed now.
- It's traveling fast.
- Too fast, sir.
There's no one left to control it.
When it gets over the area, we'll have a minute to capture the images.
We'll just need enough to chart a route from the land to the lab.
We've tapped into one of the Air Force's spy satellites to check the traffic to Fort Detrick.
Well, why not send your helicopter or drone?
No more fuel.
They spent it all looking for me.
- Satellite passing over us.
- This is U.S.S. Nathan James, over.
- Any station in this net...
- Come on, give us something.
- This is U.S.S. Nathan James.
Over.
- There it is.
Home.
- That's Interstate 70.
- If clear, it'll get us all the way to Detrick.
There'll be some image blur, but I'll get you closer, sir.
That's a mass evacuation.
- Take us north a mile.
- Aye, sir.
Any station in this vicinity of Fort Detrick USAMRIID, this is U.S.S. Nathan James.
That red X, some sort of quarantine?
More like a warning sign to stay away.
Looks like people took it seriously.
Sir, the satellite's approaching Fort Detrick.
I say again, anyone at Fort Detrick, please respond.
The laboratory building's in the center of campus.
Roger that, ma'am.
Zooming in.
Oh, my God.
It's been completely destroyed.
The lab, the containment areas the equipment, everything.
Nothing else on the base was burned.
That lab was targeted.
Who would've done that?
Slow down.
Slow down.
Stop the car.
- Where you going?
- My family's sick.
They need help.
- You can't go this way.
Turn around.
- Please.
- Please, we're trying to get to Olympia.
- Olympia can't help you.
Go back where you came from, old man.
Get down.
Should we go after them?
No.
They'll be dead soon.
Sir!
Sir!
Take a breath.
What is it?
I caught a new broadcast.
It's another loop, but this one was updated today.
And there's something you need to hear.
Winds are coming southwest and temperatures will reach 50 degrees in Baltimore.
How come we're hearing this now?
A weak FM transmitter.
It must've just come into range.
There are reports of an outbreak of the Red Flu...
Red Flu. ls that what they're calling it?
- Doesn't do it justice, somehow.
- It's looping around.
Here it comes.
Nathan James, we are aware of your mission and we have secured the facility you require.
If you are within range of the signal, we urge you to reply over channel 1-6.
I repeat, U.S.S. Nathan James if you are still out there, please reply on VHF channel 1-6.
- Get them on the line.
- Yes, sir.
This is U.S. Naval warship Nathan James hailing you on channel 1-6.
We have heard your call, over.
This is U.S. Naval warship Nathan James hailing you on channel 1-6.
We have heard your call, over.
Baltimore.
We'll set a course in that direction.
Agreed.
We may still be too far out.
Then let me know as soon as you find out.
Good work, son.
Schools have reopened in Sector 3 and some city services are set to resume.
Attention, attention.
This call goes out to the crew of the USS.
Nathan James.
We are aware of your mission and we have secured the facility you may require.
If you are in range of the signal we urge you to reply over channel 1-6.
I repeat, USS.
Nathan James, if you are still out there...
- Jed?
- Did you hear that, Darien?
Tom's still out there and people are waiting for him.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
You're gonna make it.
You hang in there.
I had to do what was best-- Best for who?
- Please listen.
- How could that...
Ava?
- Quincy, we have been through it.
- This is not fair.
- They're at it again.
- Tell me what this is.
You know that I love you.
Events, just, they keep happening and have a mind of their own...
I know that things are better now but I don't think they'll be the same again.
- Hello, Kelly.
- Hi.
- Ava, darling, shall we find something to eat?
- All right.
- I'll see you later.
- I'll see you later.
Bye.
She can't forgive me for what I put them through.
And to be honest, I don't blame her.
Well, when the captain finds the right place for us to put ashore maybe you can all start again on more solid ground.
Captain, I've got Baltimore.
- A Mrs. Granderson is on the line.
- Did you say Granderson?
- Yes, sir.
- Well, put her through.
They're trying to use the VIDCOM, but can only get audio, sir.
- Go ahead, sir.
- This is Tom Chandler...
Captain Chandler.
You have no idea how good it is to hear your voice.
We thought you were lost at sea.
No, ma'am, we're alive and well.
Oh, there you are.
- I got it.
- You must be nearby.
I'm Amy Granderson and I suppose an explanation is in order.
As vice-chair of the President's Defense Policy Board I was briefed on your mission to the Arctic.
I knew the risks of the coming pandemic and I had my daughter transferred to your ship.
You must forgive me.
No apology needed, ma'am.
Your daughter's been an incredible asset.
I'm pleased to hear from you.
We had no word from the presidential bunker.
President Geller invited me underground.
I declined.
I thought the risk was too big to have so much of our civilian and military command in one confined space.
Unfortunately, I was right.
So the government is gone?
For the most part, yes.
Since the bunker went silent there has been a breakdown in infrastructure general panic, and, of course, a tremendous loss of life.
I have tried to execute a contingency plan working with the state and local police to create safe zones.
We have been hanging on as best we can.
And I have been praying every day for your return.
Ma'am, we can be in Baltimore in a matter of hours.
In the meantime, I'm sure there is someone you'd like to speak with.
Mom?
Alisha.
Mom, I don't-
- I don't understand.
What are you doing?
Where are you?
I'm here, darling.
Oh, I knew you were out there.
I just knew it.
Thorwald.
We've intercepted a transmission.
A U.S. Navy ship is due to make port in a matter of hours in Baltimore Harbor.
- What kind of ship?
- I don't know, sir.
Well, is it a tug?
A destroyer?
A 5000-sailor aircraft carrier?
The signal was spotty.
All we know is the name.
Nathan James.
It's the ship they've been hailing for weeks.
Granderson's sending out a greeting party.
Well, if they're having a party then let's party.
We cleared Baltimore, port distance 1000 yards.
No threats, no contacts.
All commands reporting forced rigging.
VBSS on the way to designated meeting point.
E-W reports negative rackets of interest.
Nothing moving on surface plot.
Clean picture.
Bridge, CIC.
ATTWO reports SCAT team manned and ready at all crew-served weapon stations port and starboard.
All right, let's move.
Fan out.
- Aye, sir.
- Secure perimeter.
Dennis and Rowler, left flank.
Cruz, we take right.
Keep your heads on a swivel, fellas.
Perimeter secure.
- Keep eyes on upper structures.
- Copy.
Here they come.
Contact the front.
Hi.
Hey.
I'm Lieutenant Pete Norris of the Maryland State Police.
Inside my vehicles are my assistant barrack commander my criminal section supervisor, and a few surviving state troopers.
You don't need the masks.
We're not sick.
I'm Lieutenant Green, this is Lieutenant Burk.
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, lieutenant.
Bridge, Burk.
The pier is secure.
All clear, over.
Understand.
All clear on the beach.
Landing party underway.
- Welcome to Baltimore.
- It's great to be here.
Looks like the troopers just got a couple hundred U.S. sailors.
A few dozen Tomahawks too.
Second landing party arriving.
Including the captain.
You must be Lieutenant Norris.
Tom Chandler, CO, Nathan James.
Pleasure to meet you.
This is Lieutenant Landau.
- Ma'am.
- Sir.
Hey.
How y'all doing?
Just fine, now that you're here.
We can escort you guys back to our HQ.
Here comes another van.
Cobra 1 in place.
All clear on the beach.
- Holy shit.
- What?
Mom?
I had to come see for myself.
Oh, my baby girl.
It's her.
It's Granderson.
She came out herself.
I am so glad to have you back.
Captain Chandler, thank you.
Thank you for returning my daughter to me.
Privilege.
We wouldn't be here without her.
Take the shot.
Mrs. Granderson, we really need to get you back in the vehicle.
She's blocked.
Come.
Everyone's eager to meet you.
I can take out the fat man.
No.
You only have one shot.
I want her.
Nathan James, we're having a family reunion here.
We're headed out with the group.
Sending Lieutenant Norris back with the VBSS to update you with the situation on ground, sir.
Roger that.
We'll arrange a welcome for Lieutenant Norris.
Oh, and say hi to Mom for us.
Damn it.
I lost her.
Talk to your friends on the inside.
Find out what they're doing here.
We were fortunate to find this building.
There's only one coal-fired plant still operational and we have a direct line.
Plus, strategically, we're far enough from the city to avoid infection.
You'll be safe here.
Come.
Mom, this is amazing.
- Yes, but it's been a battle.
- And who's the enemy?
Warlords, they call themselves.
And recently, they've killed more people than the actual virus.
Do you know they raided the National Archives?
They actually tried to steal original copies of the Constitution.
As if that could take away who we are as a people.
Captain.
I didn't wanna broadcast about the virus over an open radio feed but the president told me that you had the materials to produce a vaccine.
Is that true?
Yes, ma'am.
We've actually made a little more progress than that, Mrs. Granderson.
We have the cure.
Fort Detrick was our first option too.
They had the lab and all, but Thorvvald got there first.
- Thorvvald?
- A former Baltimore P.D turned self-proclaimed leader of the warlords.
Been a real pain in our ass since this whole thing started.
I shouldn't complain.
I imagine you've been through a hell of a time yourselves.
Listen, lieutenant, last I talked to my wife she was taking the family to Deer Park.
- Safe zone, heard of it.
You know if it's still there?
There was fighting, but there are survivors.
I can get you there as soon as we get you off the ship.
Thanks, doc.
You have no idea how good that felt.
- Oh, I have some idea.
- Yeah.
What were the results of Test 37?
See, these results are consistent...
Now, this is the main reason we chose this building.
We've worked for months trying to develop a cure but now you're here.
It's heavenly.
You're not gonna like this, boss.
My guy inside Granderson's said the ship came back with a cure.
It could be bullshit.
We've heard this before.
Not from the U.S. Navy.
If that's true, Granderson will spread out.
Go anywhere she wants.
We will lose the city.
We need to get our hands on the cure.
It's probably locked away somewhere on the ship.
The only way is to take Granderson on directly.
We have to take her lab.
Extraordinary.
Look at her.
She's in love with a toaster.
- You still haven't made your move?
- I've been making my move since Gitmo.
She ain't buying what I'm selling.
I thought once she saved the world, she'd let loose a little.
Nathan James, this is Vulture 1.
DO you copy?
This is her letting loose.
I repeat, Nathan James, this is Vulture 1.
Do you copy?
- I can't get through, sir.
- You won't get a signal.
Warlords are jamming local frequencies.
They have a radio room, sir.
I let the XO know where we are.
Ma'am, if that radio room's still available I'd like to get word to my family, see if they're out there.
I think it's time you thought of yourself.
Meanwhile, we can work with your team to arrange safe transit here for your ship's crew.

Hey, listen, just wanted to let you know that I'm heading off.
Heading off?
What are you talking about?
I'm moving on.
By yourself?
But it's chaos out there.
I've seen worse.
And thanks to you, I can travel wherever I like.
Where will you go?
I got things to take care of.
The young girl whose picture that you keep in your locket.
Among other things, yeah.
Anyway, you seem to have things plenty well in hand here.
Right, then.
Uh, you're a special woman, you know that?
You take care, now.
What the hell.
This is Tom Chandler looking for Jed Chandler in Clearwater, Virginia.

- Tom?
- Dad?
Dad?
Are you there?
It's me.
It's Tom.
I'm back.
- Tom.
- I'm here, Dad.
Tommy?
Are you at the cabin?
- We 're going to Baltimore.
- Baltimore?
- Are you with the kids?
Darien?
- We're sick.
We had to leave the cabin.
Going to Olympia.
It's our only hope for a cure.
Please, Tom, come quick.
We're sick.
Tell me exactly where you are.
What do you see?
- Onik's Truck Stop.
- Truck stop?
- What happened?
Are you on the road?
- Onik Truck Stop.
- It's a tire shop downtown.
- We can get you there.
Listen to me.
Stay put.
I'm coming for you.
Put these jackets on.
You'll blend in better.
We're in and out, gentlemen.
Dad?
- Dad?
- Let's get eyes 360.
- Darien?
- Sir.
Dad?
Darien?
Where did you get this radio?
- Where did you get this radio?
Answer me!
- It's mine now.
The man you took this radio from, where'd he go?
- Where did he go?
Where?
- The arena.
- What arena?
- Olympia.
Olympia.
Come on.
Let's go.
- Can't do that, sir.
- What do you mean?
- Olympia's for sick people.
- But we're immune.
- You got the shots too.
- Get back in the car.
We're going back to base.
- We're going to Olympia.
- You don't give the orders, captain.
- Drop your weapon!
- Don't wanna do this.
We're on the same side.
Everybody calm down.
Master chief!
I'm all right.
I'm okay.
Nathan James, this is Vulture 2.
Come in.
Damn it.
Still can't get through.
Take the truck, get the master chief back to the ship.
- Tell the XO what's going on.
- What is going on?
Find a way to get the others back to the ship.
We're getting out of Baltimore.
You Okay?
What about us?
We're going to Olympia.
You'll inform the others, then?
Very good.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
All good.
Everything's under control.
I wanna try and look for Sarah.
If you survived, there's a chance...
- ...that maybe she's still okay.
- Alisha.
Your friend lived in Wisconsin.
There's no way to get there now.
- Soon, maybe.
- But if we make--
Soon.
Now tell me this.
What kind of man is Captain Chandler?
He's amazing.
Without him, we wouldn't have gotten through any of this.
So he hasn't let the power go to his head?
I'm not sure I understand the question.
I'm asking if he will still follow orders.
Follow orders from whom?
Mother, what's going on?
Michael.
Have you seen these protocols?
Of course.
Why?
Well, Dr. Hamada claims that his treatment prolongs the lives of the infected.
But his whole assumption about the virus seems to be wrong.
Heh.
I'm a statistician.
The data he's given suggests treatment's working.
- No, impossible.
- Is something wrong?
Dr. Hamada.
You're using Ribavirin to introduce higher error rates to the virus' DNA replication.
- In a chemical cocktail, yes.
- The pandemic virus is error-free.
Your treatment wouldn't have any positive effect whatsoever.
In fact, these dose levels are highly toxic.
Uh...
Enter quietly and follow instructions once inside.
You will be told which section to wait for treatment.
You will receive medication in sequence of arrival.
Left through the turnstile and wait for assessment.
Do not mass in front of doors.
Enter quietly and follow instructions once inside.
You will be told which section to wait for treatment.
You will receive medication in sequence of arrival.
Daddy?
Daddy?
- Daddy.
- Ashley.
- Daddy.
Daddy.
- Ashley.
Oh, my God.
- Sammy.
- Daddy.
- Daddy, we're sick.
- I know, baby.
I know.
Daddy's gonna make it better, okay?
Where's Mommy?
- Tommy.
- Where's your mother?
- Tommy.
- Dad, why didn't you wait for me?
Sam, a little pinch.
A little pinch.
This is gonna make you feel better.
- Tommy.
- Where is she?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Dad, where's Darien?
She's gone, son.
She's gone.
I tried to do everything I could to save her.
- I tried to.
I tried to.
- I know you did, Pop.
I know you did.
But right now I gotta give you this.
Stack the cases by the door.
We'll put them on a pallet.
Unload them dockside as we make port.
I'm not sure exactly when that's gonna be-
- Hey, Norris.
- Answer a question for us if you could.
- Yes, sir.
- Commander.
Commander.
- Whoa!
Get on the horn, and give the order to drop anchor.
You muster your entire crew on the flight deck.
Open up the door to the helo bay...
- ...where you're storing the cure.
- I'm not giving you a thing.
- I don't know your plan--
- You do exactly what I say.
Or I'll pick off your crew one-by-one.
My troopers are everywhere.
This ship is mine now.
Please, he needs help.
- Call Doc Rios.
- Nobody moves.
- Nobody move.
- Put down that weapon.
- You don't think I'll do it?
- Put down that weapon.
You think I won't do it, XO?
Just try me.
I'm not gonna tell you again, commander.
Muster your crew.
Doctor.
My troopers say they experienced no side effects from the cure.
It's amazing what you've created.
I wish I could say the same in return.
I understand you have some questions about the way we've been treating the sick.
What you are giving the sick is anything but a treatment.
- Of that, I am sure.
- Doctor.
You know this.
In the 14th century the Black Death wiped out 60 percent of the European population.
The plague killed indiscriminately.
The artists, scientists thinkers so few and precious to begin with, were wiped out.
It upended the social order and prolonged the Dark Ages a hundred and fifty years.
I cannot let that happen here.
I understand your allegiance to your friends.
You've gone through so much together but you've seen nothing of the chaos here at home.
The hysteria.
The cruelty.
The savagery.
You must try to see the situation from our point of view.
There are people out there who would use this crisis to take what does not belong to them.
They are the barbarians at the gate who want to send us into a new Dark Age.
We have the power to stop them.
To keep them in their place.
It is my duty to help the right people first.
The people whose survival will ensure the future of our entire society and all that we hold dear.
So you gathered your elite few within these walls.
And the rest what happens to them?
The virus doesn't discriminate.
That unfortunate task falls to me.
Please.
Hey, what are you doing?
You can't be here.
- You're killing them.
- Get the hell back behind the curtain.
- You're killing them.
- Stay back.
You sick bastards.
Captain, we gotta move.
Security breach in Section 12.
Repeat, security breach in Section 12.
I don't get it.
They're burning them.
They're burning the bodies to power the city.
I know it's hard to understand.
You've been away so long.
But in time, Rachel, you'll see it's the only way.
- She was trying to run.
- Dr. Scott, I had no idea this was happening.
- I swear it--
- Hush, dear.
You can't replicate my work with the doses that I've given you.
Everything that you need is locked up on that ship.
And the captain will never give it up.
You let me worry about the captain.
Daddy.
We have to go.
Nathan James, come in.
Do you read me?
Nathan James, come in.
DO you read me?
Nathan James, this is the captain.
Come in.
Do you read me?
Nathan James, come in.
Do you read me?
Nathan James, this is the captain.
Come in.
Do you read me?
Nathan James, where are you?
Ripped By mstoll
And then, he or she leaves the money with the cashier and then brings home the items you requested.
Ian, it's impossible.
You can't train a dog to go grocery shopping.
I can't even train you to go grocery shopping.
- Because that's dog work.
- Hey, wait, wait.
Aren't you gonna offer to help Mr. Norwood with his bags?
Dad, if I offered to help every person carry their bags for them, they...
I could be rich.
That's a great idea.
You know why it works?
'Cause you can picture it on the side of an arena.
- Ah, let me help you with these.
- Thanks, Mike.
Next time, I'll splurge.
I'll buy some with wheels.
Ah, sorry.
Ian would've helped you with your bags, but he...
I don't even know how to finish that sentence.
Sorry.
It's all right.
Kids these days.
You know, they're in their own world.
This whole twerking, you know, I mean, is that a hell of a thing?
Okay, is this it?
I think we're over the weight limit.
Hopefully, that's a ballpark number.
You must be going on quite a trip.
You know, I love New York.
But there's one thing New York doesn't have:
- waterslides.
- Yeah, that's why they call it the...
- city that never slides.
- When I was a kid, I loved waterslides.
So as a treat to my younger self,
I'm gonna take a waterslide tour of the lower Southwest.
So if anybody comes looking for me,
- you tell 'em that's where I am.
- I'll be sure to spread the word.
Hands up, Norwood!
You're under arrest.
Man, they must take that weight limit thing pretty seriously.
1x13
- Secret
There's a lotta cops down there.
I can't believe there was a fugitive living 10 feet from our children.
I can't believe I missed the story.
Channel 6 got the scoop on this, and their weather map still shows the Soviet Union.
Eh, don't beat yourself up, Dad.
So you missed the fact that our neighbor was an infamous mobster who's been in hiding for the last 20 years.
I mean, where's the story there?
This just in..."local man's love for daughter fading fast."
Hey, if it makes you feel any better,
- Norwood had everyone fooled.
- Not me.
I always knew
- there was something up with that guy.
- You knew?
The guy whose shirt is on backwards and inside out.
- And it's my shirt.
- Yeah, well, I found it in my drawer.
Makes the guns pop.
Bingo.
Bango.
Okay, what do we tell Graham?
Because he was friends with Norwood.
- There are a lot of police outside.
- That's true.
They're here to take Mr. Norwood to a farm.
- A farm?
- That worked with his gerbil.
I thought they were taking him to jail for being a mobster.
And they're pretty much raising themselves
- at this point.
- Yeah, yep.
Hey, Harris.
What are you doing here?
Hey, Leigh.
This is a little awkward, but after our thing the other night,
- I think I left my watch.
- Oh, yeah.
I can't tell you how my guys have left stuff here.
I mean, not that many.
Just like the regular amount for a woman my... come in.
- I'll just look for the watch.
- Oh, this is a nice place.
It looks different with my clothes on.
Well, I don't see any watches, but it could...
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Maybe I could interest you in some cufflinks.
No, well, if the watch turns up, you know where to find me.
Look, the other night was a lot of fun.
- Huh?
- But it can't happen again.
- Can you imagine with Mike?
- Oh, yeah.
With his boss and best friend sleeping with his sister?
He would not handle that well.
Let's just chalk this up to a one-time thing.
Or maybe a two-time thing.
- But now, really, this has got to be it.
- Otherwise, what?
We start sneaking around so Mike won't find out?
Running off at odd hours of the night, you know, coming up with elaborate cover stories.
Wearing wigs to each other's apartments
- so we wouldn't be recognized.
- Yeah.
It sounds... awful.
Okay.
So a three-time thing.
Hey, buddy.
How you doing?
So according to Cha...
Channel 6, our old neighbor stole a lotta money over the years, most of which is unaccounted for.
Luckily, we had someone on the inside.
You know, Graham, sometimes the best way to deal with losing a friend is to talk about everything he's ever said to you.
A few days ago, he gave me a statue, told me to hang on to it for safekeeping.
Those are his exact words?
"Hold on to it for safekeeping"?
Graham, do you know how valuable this statue could be?
- Where'd you put it?
- Um...
Maybe we'll get lucky and it'll be on top.
- At least it's dry.
- Yeah, it...
I don't think they're gonna find it.
And you know how they say that no one ever makes it out of a North Korean prison alive.
I may have missed the Norwood story, but my intuition was still sharp enough to know that Susan was about to rip into me.
Well, it's true.
I mean, when I finally left there,
I was clinically dead.
I mean, I saw god.
- Hi, Mike.
- Damn it!
Excuse me for a minute.
Hey, Mike, you have a second?
All right, let's hear it.
I know you've probably been saving up Norwood jokes all morning.
- Give me your best shot.
- What are you talking about?
That could've happened to anyone, I mean, all we have to care about now is where Norwood stashed that cash.
Wow.
Cool.
I appreciate your professionalism.
- I'm right on it.
- Good.
If you need any help, just ask my new assistant Al.
- Al Capone.
- I'm her assistant, see?
I'm sorry, Mike, she's making me do this.
This is all you got?
You got Doug in a cheap, rented suit?
- This is my suit.
- I was expecting phone calls from Tony Soprano all day, or a horse's head on my chair.
- You're losing your touch.
- Yeah, maybe.
But then again, you know, I'm not the investigative journalist who had no idea that there was a fugitive right under my nose.
At least I've been working with the same nose
- my whole career.
- Ooh.
Golly, Mike.
You always manage to get the last laugh.
And there's a stuffed horse's head on my chair.
Harris.
- Huh?
- There you are.
Listen, I know what you're thinking, buddy, and let me just promise you...
I haven't lost my touch.
Mike, I guarantee you that's not what I was thinking.
Because the thing is I thought I could come back to work and just pick up where I left off, but that's unfair to me.
- Yeah, totally unfair, so...
- What it boils down to is...
- Right, right.
Boil it.
- I've been out of the game for a while, but like any great athlete, it's gonna take me a while to get those muscles back in shape again.
Yeah, so get back out there, champ!
Immediately.
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna get an exclusive interview with Norwood, and I'm gonna find out where that money is.
No need to know the process.
Just dazzle me with the results.
I will, 'cause from now on...
nothing gets by me.
That was close.
Maybe we shouldn't do this at your office anymore.
Yeah, you're right.
Anyone can see us.
It's just an...
unnecessary... risk.
- I'll lock the door.
- Don't.
You wanna be bad?
You wanna be bad?
You wanna be bad, huh?
I've been worried Norwood may had a bad influence on the kids.
I was making a statement to the police when they were taking him away.
Graham accused me of flipping.
Annie, you're a great mother.
One mobster isn't gonna undo years of loving and attentive parenting.
- What's going on?
- What do you mean?
You're acting super weird today.
You didn't second-guess my parenting.
You didn't call any of the girls at anthropologie a bitch.
You haven't complained about the royal baby once.
- You're seeing someone.
- No.
Yes, you are!
You're seeing someone!
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Since when?
You always talk about the guys you date!
You even told me about the undercover CIA agent you were seeing,
- and that was technically treason.
- He wasn't a CIA agent.
He played a CIA agent...
in a confidence scheme... that I fell for.
So why would you wanna keep this guy a secret?
Unless... you think maybe he's the one, but you're afraid you'll jinx it.
That's it.
Exactly.
Now, let's change the subject before we ruin my relationship.
Hey, say no more!
I totally respect your privacy.
What's Leigh's email password?
I thought you were gonna respect her privacy.
Well, that's just something people say.
Yeah, something people who respect privacy say.
I know who it is.
It's the doorman.
I've definitely noticed them flirting.
Oh, Mike.
He would be so good for her.
He's courteous, responsible, always opens the door for you.
You realize you're just describing a doorman, right?
Besides, if he's into anyone, he's into me.
No, I'm serious.
Whenever he has a delivery, he always puts a little spin on the word "package."
- Nice.
- That's what he says.
- You have enough questions for Norwood?
- I...
I think so.
I had to strong-arm the D.A. to get an hour with this guy.
I gotta make it count.
The people deserve answers.
My husband, so noble and relentless.
Then I'm gonna rub those answers in Susan's stupid face.
- Also a little bit petty.
- It's "penis", by the way.
I'm in.
So it must get lonely down here, opening doors for people all day.
You have anybody special at home opening doors for you?
- I have a, uh, doorman at my place.
- No, I mean...
- I mean, are you seeing anybody?
- Ah.
Andy, it's me!
It's Mrs. Henry from 5A!
I used to call you Adam for a while.
- You can talk to me.
- Okay, yes.
There is someone, but we're trying to keep it quiet.
- My job makes it... complicated.
- Complicated.
Gotcha.
Just so you know...
I'm rooting for you and Leigh.
Leigh?
The woman in 1A that keeps badmouthing the royal baby?
No.
No.
No, my girlfriend's name is Tricia.
The mail lady?
Why does that need to be a secret?
Oh, it would be quite the scandal in the lobby community.
It really would.
- Harris?
- Hey!
Annie!
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here to see, uh...
Mike.
And bring him flowers.
- Flowers?
- Yeah, that's right.
You know, I think it's sad that a male friend can't bring another male friend flowers just because.
I mean, I don't mean to direct this at you.
It's about society as a whole.
Well, anyway, what's new with you?
Give me the latest on Annie Henry.
Oh, I'm just preoccupied with this whole Leigh thing.
Oh, Leigh, your sister-in-law, right?
Yeah, what about her?
She's dating some guy, won't say who it is.
And apparently... he's the one.
Really?
The one?
Uh, yeah, yeah, what...
what fun for her... and whoever the guy might be.
Listen, I gotta go.
So make sure Mike puts those in water with a crushed aspirin.
They'll last longer.
- You have to pu...
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and you go through it.
- Ease out...
Mike.
Mikey!
You are a sight for sore eyes.
- I gotta tell you, prison's really rough.
- Not enough waterslides for you?
You know, they say that you should beat up a guy the first day.
Heh.
Easier said than done.
A lot of these guys, they're really strong.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Norwood.
Or should I say Joey "the Lip" Baldino?
This guy was going down.
Two men enter, one man leaves.
Of course, the other man was handcuffed to the table, but still.
Let's dive right in.
Millions of dollars are unaccounted...
Before we get into that, can I ask you something?
Shoot, Joey.
Uh, figure of speech.
You really didn't know who I was?
I mean, really?
How could you not know?
!
You lived next door to me for ten years!
That, sir, is a bald-faced lie.
It was actually 11.
So you had no clue.
I mean, whenever we would watch Goodfellas together,
I'd sit on the couch.
I'd be yelling...
- "No!
No!
No!
They got it all wrong!"
- Well, I definitely noticed you were a bad person to watch a movie with.
But it's not like we spent that much time together.
What are you talking about?
You used to come over to play poker.
Man, you'd clean up.
Yeah, when you move as much as I do, everything seems like a tell.
Yeah.
That's why the guys loved you so much, which is probably why they never shook you down.
So these poker games involved some of your associates?
- On occasion.
- So would you say
I successfully infiltrated your poker game?
- Not really.
- Could you say it?
...how bad I smell?
Ugh, is there still yogurt in my hair?
- Yes, everywhere.
- Ugh.
- Hey, guys, great seeing you.
- Yeah, great for you, maybe.
We spent the last two days in the garbage.
You know, a lot of people throw out handfuls of band-aids down that chute.
In the future when a mobster gives you a statue,
- you don't throw it out.
- Well, again, great seeing you.
Why arare you being so weird?
Hey.
- Hey, what's under that pillow?
- This is my private space.
Oh.
Well, yeah, that checks out.
All right, then.
Hey, we'll just be on our...
Sneak attack!
- Aghh!
- The statue!
- Graham!
Why did you lie to us?
- Because you said it was valuable, and I'm gonna trade it to friend Ben for a cool rock.
- No!
- Are you crazy?
Graham!
There's probablyomething really valuable inside, like a stolen diamond or an even more valuable owl statue!
We gotta break it open!
N...you can't break this open.
This is crime memorabilia.
We can sell this online and get like $500.
You know what's cooler than $500?
$5 million.
Uh, yeah.
No one's arguing the other side of that.
I'm just saying if we break this open, and there's nothing inside, then it will be totally worthless.
- You're worthless!
- I want the rock!
Whoa!
No!
Don't just stand there!
Graham!
I caught it!
Did you see that?
Wait, I wanted it to break.
Oh!
Could you guys kill each other more quietly?
I'm trying to get through Aunt Leigh's emails.
Oh!
Great.
Mom can be the tiebreaker.
Okay, so Mr. Norwood gave Graham this owl a few days before he was arrested.
- Ian wants to break it open.
- Yeah.
Graham wants to trade it for a rock, and I want to sell it on ebay.
All good ideas.
I'm gonna go with none of them.
- Okay, we're taking that to the police.
- Oh, Mom.
You're the worst.
- Hey.
Never speak against the family.
- Thank you, Graham.
Maybe Norwood wasn't such a bad influence.
- Forget about it.
- Okay, I think he... yeah, he was.
- Leigh.
- Damn it!
You knew it was me?
I thought for sure this would throw people off the scent.
You know, this is why you never cheap out on a wig.
No, I was just not expecting to see you tonight.
I don't feel so great.
Do not eat scallops in winter.
Oh.
We don't have to go to dinner.
We could just stay in and watch a show on Netflix.
I've heard good things about Lilyhammer, but it's two seasons so it's kind of a commitment.
- I don't want a commitment!
- Oh.
All right, this is weird.
- What's going on?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
You know, Annie told me what you said about me being "the one,"
and don't take this personally, but uh-uh.
Oh, relax, buddy.
I just said that to Annie so that she would get off my back.
Believe me, if there is "a one", it is definitely not you.
Oh, thank god.
You know, it's just...
I'm happy with the way things are going.
You know, actually,
I can't remember the last time I had this much fun.
To tell you the truth, this is all I think about when we're not together.
Yeah, me too.
I can't get you off my mind.
And I can't concentrate at work because I'm...
Just thinking of ways to sneak off to see you.
Yeah!
- Does that mean...
- Maybe you are the one.
- Damn it.
- Damn it.
It's all right.
Oh, hey, Mike, what are you doing, looking at the footage of your interview?
- Yep.
It's a triumph.
- Oh, good.
- So much good stuff.
- Don't you remember?
You gave me that spare key to your apartment?
Mike:
Yeah, but that was just to water my plants.
And when I get home, I'm counting them.
Almost too much.
Let me turn this off.
- Mm-hmm.
- Bill!
Randall!
Come here!
Come here!
- This is the guy I was telling you about!
- Oh, no!
No, no, no.
This is Mike Henry!
He had no clue!
Honest to god.
It turns out Bill and Randall were big fans.
Mm-hmm.
Well, that's good, Because they're our key demographic.
- I signed a few autographs.
- Uh-huh.
In crayon, 'cause it's hard to make a shiv out of a crayon.
Yeah, I know how to make a shiv, Mike.
You know what, Mike?
I think you've done enough on this project.
I'm gonna follow the money trail from here on out, okay?
- We'll see about that.
- He had no idea they were
- filled with cash.
- Could somebody turn this off?
Susan wants take over the Norwood story.
I don't know.
Maybe it's for the best.
I'm tired of dealing with that sociopath.
And Norwood.
Mike, the interview's gonna cut together fine.
I mean, you got a great angle.
What you don't know about your neighbor may surprise you.
Ooh!
Am I on the wrong side of the mic?
- Because that sounded good.
- I don't know, Harris.
Maybe five years is too long to be out of the game.
There was a time when nothing would get by me.
Like the creases in your shirt tell me it's the spare one from your desk, which means you slept over at a woman's last night.
Maybe I just sat weird.
And apparently, her apartment is near mine.
W-w-what would make you say that?
You got a poppy seed in your tooth, and you only like the poppy seed bagels from the deli in my neighborhood.
I had a craving.
And it's only 40 blocks.
Well, that explains that.
But what it doesn't explain... is this.
- Well, this isn't marshalls.
- How did you know she was in there?
I didn't even know she was in there.
I was waiting for the right moment to surprise you.
Well, it would've been more of a surprise
If you didn't reset the thermostat to 75.
- Harris likes it cool.
- You know, he does run hot.
He usually has to take a cold shower right after we...
Well, I should've known.
I can't keep a secret from Mike Henry.
You haven't lost a step.
I mean, you're like Batman crossed with the Mentalist.
Ooh, I watched the hell out of that show.
Well, objectively speaking, that thermostat thing was inspired.
- I scare myself sometimes.
- You know what?
- The bat mentalist, he doesn't gloat.
- Mike, what about us?
Are you mad?
What, about you two?
No, you're both... sort of adults.
What do you have to say about that?
I guess we don't have to sneak around anymore.
Yeah.
- We don't have to sneak around anymore.
- No more wigs...
- Huh.
- Huh.
Sorry we got your statue taken away.
But we found some cool stuff from the tra...
- Store.
From the store.
- Yeah.
All right.
We're square.
Life's funny.
You wake up every day with no idea of what you might discover.
Maybe it's love.
What do you mean, you can't get me in to see Norwood?
Oh, it didn't pan out?
Well, maybe you're not gonna pan out.
Oh man, you've gotta stop crying.
Listen, a lot of people's wives are pregnant.
Or sometimes, it's the answer to a mystery.
If you're still following the money trail, you might check into the house Norwood's mother bought last month.
It's a pretty big purchase for a woman who's been dead for five years.
Wh... there's no... there's no...
How did... how did you know this?
Well, it's an old money laundering trick.
It's something you pick up if you play poker with your neighbors.
And sometimes these things turn out to be a surprise.
So Harris and Leigh broke up.
And sometimes they play out pretty much how you expected.
Did you know he was the one she was dating?
Of course, I knew.
I gave them my blessing.
I figure if I hadn't, they would've gotten married just to spite me.
So what are we gonna do with this guy?
Well, I told the kids we were taking him to the police, so...
- Break it wide open?
- That's what I'm thinking.
Oops.
- Parkinson's.
- Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
What's this?
It's a letter.
"But no matter what you find, never stop searching."
Well, that's...
total nonsense.
"Bet on endless summer to win the derby."
Wait a minute.
This is...
Five years old.
Already checked.
Damn it!
So, Jim, how are you feeling?
Dr. Pinsky told me that you are having some issues?
Dr. Pinsky?
Oh, that's Dr. Drew's real name.
Why wouldn't he just call himself Dr. Drew?
Drew's short for Andrew.
Yeah, but Dr. Pinsky's a good name.
Is Drew so snappy that he... what?
What... he got an ego on him, does he?
Does he like to be called after his first name?
Does he think he's Madonna or Cher or some...
Do you want to spend the whole session talking about Dr. Drew?
There you go.
Even you call him Dr. Drew.
He... he says I'm, uh...
I'm depressed.
Are you?
Well, my career is not where I want it to be, you know?
Um, I've sort of plateaued.
Actually, no, let's be honest.
It has dropped.
I live with my two friends Billy and Steve.
Um...
Billy has muscular dystrophy.
And, uh, Steve... he's drinking way too much.
So...
It's like I'm taking care of two disabled people.
Oh, while you're writing...
Dr. Drew thinks I'm a sex addict...
'Cause I wank on planes.
And he says that's wrong.
But I've never seen a sign that said not to.
Oh, the... the little "No Smoking" sign... that's always up there.
There's never been a "No Wanking" sign right next to it that bleeps on.
"Wanking... you can't do it on the plane.
"We have detectors in the bathroom in case you do.
It's a federal offense."
I... you know, I don't see what the big problem is there.
It's not like I do it in my seat.
You know, Jim, while you're sorting through this rut, this funk of yours,
I think it would be good for you to be of service to others, not just your roommates.
I think you'll find it very rewarding.
I don't know about this whole therapy thing.
They don't really do anything.
They give you no practical advice.
Everything's just, like, talking.
It's like, "How does that make you feel?"
"Why would you do that?" "Please put that down."
"Does that make you angry?" You know?
Yeah, it makes me angry.
I'd rather just talk to you guys.
What's wrong with him?
Danny.
Spazzy Danny?
Yes, spazzy Danny.
What's up with spazzy Danny, besides muscular dystrophy?
He can't play video games anymore.
Why can't he play video games anymore?
- His thumbs.
- Thumbs?
Yeah.
You know, the thumbs are usually the last thing to go.
Billy, when did your thumbs stop working?
Stop it, Jim.
Billy's thumbs went years ago.
Billy used to go over there all the time and watch him play.
He was kind of like a coach to him.
Huh.
Well, I guess neither of them could play the Wii, so...
Steve, let's go.
- Jim, you're an asshole.
- You are.
Billy, I'm joking.
It was just a joke.
Where are you going?
I'm going over there to try to cheer him up.
Maybe I'll go over there and cheer him up.
How are you gonna cheer him up?
Welcome to the Shady Grove residential care comedy show.
I'm actually here to, uh, support my friend Danny here.
G'day, Danny.
Okay, so, there's two types of couples in the world, isn't there?
There's the couples that have dogs, you know... those annoying couples?
They have a dog.
And then there's the other couples that have actual children.
So, the people that have dogs, they act like it's their child, but it's really not their child, is it, 'cause what happens if the girlfriend's away on work and the dog dies?
What do you do?
You go off and buy another dog that looks very similar to the original dog, and you try to pass it off as the same dog.
No, no, no.
Rodney, mate, that's, uh...
that's not the end of the joke.
Okay.
You sure?
Pr... yeah.
Yep.
Sure.
So, okay, so, you go off and buy a dog looks very similar to the original dog, try to pass it off as the same dog.
But what happens if your girlfriend's away on work and the baby dies?
_
Hilarious!
No, that's... please, Rodney, n...
I get it!
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.
- That's not the end.
- Yes, it is.
Look.
When the joke ends,
I'll make it very obvious, but don't laugh until I...
I'll point it out, okay?
I'll give you a signal, and then laugh.
So I'll go like this, and then you laugh.
Not now!
At the end of the joke.
So don't do it right now when I do that.
But I'll...
I'll be...
Some of his best stuff.
- He's shit!
- All right, let's just wrap this up.
The dog's already dead.
They replaced the dog.
So what happens if your girlfriend goes away on work and the baby dies?
Very hard to get a baby that looks exactly the same in the short period of time that you have.
All right, Danny's getting it.
Yeah.
Yeah, eas... easier if they're black or Asian.
Hey!
Hey, Danny, don't be racist.
I'm not saying 'cause they look the same.
I'm saying 'cause they're easier to purchase.
Crash cart to the rec room, stat.
Am I right?
If... if Angelina Jolie and Madonna has taught us anything, it's that you can buy black and Asian...
Children.
- Hey!
Hey!
Stop talking.
Oxygen.
Danny?
Yeah, look, uh, I want to point out that...
- Shut up!
- ...that's not a racist joke.
- It's more of a commentary on society.
- Breathe.
Danny, come on.
- Jim, stop it!
- I'm not racist, so you know.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Take a breath.
Breathe.
Thank God Danny saved me.
I was dying.
Danny, breathe!
Danny.
He's gone.
- I killed.
- Stop it.
Laughter is the best medicine.
You kill him!
That was the last one...
last one in my original group.
There were six of us.
We all got diagnosed around the same time, shared the same pain, same trials.
We really bonded.
All five of them are dead.
The funky bunch.
Oh, that's right.
I'm sorry, Rodney?
They were called the funky bunch.
Funky bunch?
Marky Mark was very popular at the time.
Of course.
That's why you were called the funky bunch.
We were 14!
Stop!
The funky bunch is over!
Honey?
Honey, I just heard.
Are you okay?
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, mom, it happened so suddenly.
I mean, Jim was just up there telling jokes, and then...
Jim, you killed Danny?
No.
No, I went down there to help.
I was doing a show.
That's all.
- What was the joke?
- Walter!
What?
I want to know!
The one where Angelina Jolie buys blacks.
And the Asians.
- That's a good one.
- Walter!
That's a good j... you got any beer?
The fridge.
He killed him, Walter!
No, he didn't, mom.
Danny was old!
He was like 34!
He never should've lived past 30!
Good one.
Nice, Steve.
You know, every day that Billy's still with us, it's a blessing and a curse, I'll tell you.
You know, on the one hand, he's around so we can enjoy him, but on the other, the poor guy's suffering.
Yeah, dad, we get it.
"Billy's suffering.
Billy lost his friend."
Stevie boy... don't "Stevie boy" me, dad.
What is the matter with you?
I'll tell you what's the matter with me.
I'm sick and tired of everybody pretending like Billy's the only one with problems.
Oh, Steve, everybody is well-aware that you have problems... huge problems!
Yeah, but yours are self-inflicted, Steve.
That's a funny one, Jim.
Yeah, I get it. "Yeah, Steve can take it." Yeah.
Oh, come on, Steve.
No, y come on, Jim!
You know I've been dealing with this shit my whole life?
And all I ever ask for is for somebody to just listen maybe, maybe even empathize a little!
- Mom, please, I just want to be alone.
Oh, honey, Steve doesn't mean it.
He's an idiot.
Mom...
Alone.
Okay.
Okay.
I didn't get a normal childhood, dad.
We never went on a normal vacation.
We never went camping, to an amusement park!
We didn't go anywhere that didn't have a ramp!
Look, Steve.
Steve, I'm sorry.
I...
I really tried, but...
- I once had that idea for a theme park.
- Jesus.
- Ramp world.
- Oh, God.
Oh, yeah.
You go up, you go down... just like life!
It's exactly like life.
- Just shut the hell up, dad, please.
- Ah, ramp world.
Stop encouraging him.
Oh, could've been millionaires.
Jesus, God, dad, shut the hell up, please!
That's, uh, still a good idea.
You know I've seen Jerry Lewis live seven times?
- Never seen him at ramp world.
- Shut up!
- Well...
- There's times I thought that I knew Jerry Lewis better than I knew my own dad!
Ah, Steve, you've seen me more than seven times!
You know how many times I prayed that I'd get sick just so I could get some attention?
- Ohh, man!
- Jesus.
Really, Steve?
No, not really.
I don't want to be sick.
That shit sucks.
- But the point is that sometimes...
- I got to go.
I got... you guys make me feel like I'm not even here!
I got to go check on Billy.
Just...
- Okay?
- Oh, there you go.
- Thanks for proving my point, Jim.
- All right, look.
A half-hour, we're gonna go watch some cartoons.
What do you think?
You know, your mother's a wonderful woman!
The stuff she's done for you kids over the years...
- She's gone home, Walter.
- Oh, thank God.
Hey, buddy.
Dad and I were just having a little chat.
Yeah.
I heard.
Look, uh...
Emotions are running a little bit high.
Rodney...
Could you... could you grab us some beers, please, buddy?
- Yes, sir!
- All right.
Life, huh?
Hey, it's tough everywhere.
Ah.
Thank you, Rodney.
You got this brutal thing going on.
You know, I've been living with your mother for 38 years.
Steve lost his wife and kid.
And Jim... he's nowhere near having a grounded human existence.
No wife, no kids, nothing.
This guy's like the black hole of humanity.
But at the end of the day,
I'd say he might be the luckiest of us all.
Thanks, Walter.
Let me draw it for you.
Oh, God.
Here we go.
All right, now...
This line...
Represents blowjobs.
This line...
Is time.
Over here, we have money.
Cashola, moola.
This line...
Represents relationships.
Now, over time, the more money we spend... we cause the lines to intersect, which represents...
Children.
Now, at the end of all this...
We have...
Death.
And as we lie in our coffin...
Our wives... dance on top with everything that's left.
Now, that's heterosexual.
Homosexual... blowjobs, money.
The two lines never intersect.
They got it made in the shade!
Dad, what does this mean?
"Rodney and Dokken were here."
Well, I did what you asked me to do.
I went down to a home to do some shows for a bunch of MDs and disabled people, and one of them had a heart attack and died.
How'd it make you feel?
When spazzy Danny died?
You can call him Danny.
I'm going to say...
Sad.
The funeral's coming up.
I don't think I'm gonna go.
Why not?
People don't want the killers of their children at the funeral.
And, plus, Danny's not my friend.
He was my friend's friend.
Well, don't you think it would be nice to go with your friend to support him?
I mean, it would be the nice, kind, compassionate thing to do.
Maybe I could go and tell a few jokes...
Kill a few more of them off.
Is this gonna be a big funeral?
I don't know.
Pretty big.
I think a lot of people are gonna be there.
The funky bunch won't.
- Oh, shut up, Rodney.
- But they won't.
After the viewing, he's being cremated.
Yeah?
Where are they spreading his ashes?
The ocean.
He really loved the water, which reminds me of a favor I need to ask.
Because none of us can swim,
I was hoping that you guys could do it.
- No, no.
- No, no, no.
No way.
Not gonna happen, mate.
That's not my responsibility.
- But you killed him, Jim.
- This is true.
I want to be spread on a sandwich.
- Why is it so hot in here?
- It's the devil, man.
Hey, Jerry, no cuts!
Hey, come on!
What are you doing?
Look at the little bastard.
He's cutting!
Yeah, but, Steve, we're at a funeral, right?
We're not at the DMV.
We're not at six flags.
- Who gives a shit?
- It doesn't matter.
It's the principle.
Look at how he's cutting.
Yeah, you're right.
Hey, Jerry, you dick licker, get to the back of the line!
You kill him!
- He did not.
- Yeah, he did!
- Steve!
- Why do they keep saying that I killed him?
- I didn't kill anyone.
- Ah, they're just on edge.
It's a funeral, man.
Tell you what, though... these disabled funerals are the best, man.
You know, 'cause the chicks are sad, but they're not too sad, because they saw it coming, you know?
And they're emotional, but they're not so emotional that a couple wine coolers and a little loving wouldn't cheer them up.
- Okay, Jerry, that's enough.
At the beginning of that sentence,
I thought you were disgusting, but maybe you're right.
Dude, let go.
Yeah, I've been to a lot of these things.
Ever been laid at one?
- Nope.
- Okay.
Jesus.
This is taking too long.
Who is that girl?
Okay.
Let go of her right now.
It's Danny's sister, Sara.
Sara.
I bet her name's spelled S-a-r-a.
- What?
Bet there's no "h" on the end.
You put the "h" on the end of a girl's name, it adds like 30 pounds.
See, Sara, S-a-r-a... hot girl.
Sarah, S-a-r-a-h...
it's a fat chick.
Are you kidding me?
Look at this guy.
He's cooling off by the body, and we're sweating over here.
It's not just... not just girls' names.
Boys' names.
Noah...
I never met a thin Noah.
Ralph's a fat prick.
Isn't he?
I'm sorry for your loss.
Look at this guy giving me the stink eye!
Who does he think he is?
Bring it.
I have to meet that girl.
She's amazing.
I told you, man... disabled funerals.
Danny and I grew up together.
We played together.
He was the 67th best "halo" player in the world for a while.
In many ways, he was the brother I never had.
- What?
- It's true.
♪ Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow ♪
♪ 'Tis I'll be here
What's the matter?
♪ In sunshine or in shadow
- It looks like he's just sitting in front of fun.
- You're right.
♪ Oh, Danny boy
♪ Oh, Danny boy
- I love you so.
- ♪ I love you so
Ladies and gentlemen, the funky bunch no more.
Come on!
Feel the vibration!
Hey, there.
Oh, hi.
Um, I'm...
I-I... sorry, I didn't say hello.
I'm...
I'm Jim.
Hi, Jim.
Sara.
I'm sorry for...
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.
I'm...
Danny's sister.
I guess I'm nobody.
- Steve!
- Eh.
Look, he's upset, you know?
This has really hit home for us, what with Billy, and...
I...
I'm really sorry about your brother.
Well, you should be.
From what I hear, you're the one who killed him.
Why does everyone...
I didn't kill anyone!
- You kill him!
- Shut up, Jerry!
I went down there to entertain him.
It's not your fault.
You were just telling bad jokes.
Not bad jokes... good jokes!
- Bad jokes!
- Bad audience!
- People that don't know comedy!
- I know comedy!
He does, Jim.
He really does.
Shut up, Rodney.
I can't tell if I'm drunk or just sad.
Yeah, probably both.
He just started taking an experimental drug.
It seemed to be helping.
Hope it didn't kill him.
So...
Danny told me you took Billy to a brothel?
Yes.
That's great.
- That makes me happy.
- Really?
I could never have done that for my brother, so I just used to blow him.
It's okay.
He was adopted.
- I'm kidding!
- Oh!
Come on.
Who adopts disabled kids?
No one would.
You kill him.
That's...
Ah, you're great!
You're great!
Jim, I've really enjoyed talking to you, but I got to go.
I got to find someone to scatter these ashes, so...
I can do that for you.
Really?
Yeah, I can do that!
- Hey, Jim.
- Hey, Ramona.
Excuse me.
I have to go.
She's great.
Yeah, she's a piece of work.
You know, I had to go to a psychiatrist to tell me to be nice to people.
You just do it, mate.
Here.
You've been taking care of Billy...
For 30 years.
You think he doesn't notice that?
You think your parents don't notice that?
I definitely notice it.
You've done something worthwhile with your life.
Well, it's kind of hard to feel good about anything right now.
But I don't know how to help you, you know?
I-I... there's nothing I can do.
It's easy for me to help Billy.
Y-you just got to keep him clean.
You feed him.
You wash him.
You help him go to the bathroom.
But with you, I don't know what to do.
Maybe it's worse to be hurt in the head, eh?
Yeah, I don't know about that, Jim, but thanks, man.
When's Sara getting here?
Don't worry.
She'll be here.
You like her, don't you?
Like her?
I think I love her.
- Oh, God.
- What's not to like, man?
Where have you been?
- The reading of the will.
- Yeah?
You get anything good?
He left me his video-game collection.
I have his hula hoop.
I'm gonna wear it as a belt.
Great, something you can both use.
Maybe.
Come on, Billy.
No, I'm serious.
I'm thinking about taking that drug.
Danny took it.
I-it could've killed him.
What?
Well, Sara was talking...
You talking about me?
Nah.
It's really great that you're doing this for us.
I'm a helper.
That's what I do.
Well, I'll be waiting for you up there when you get back.
Thank you.
I'll just carry your brother!
Unbelievable.
I think I love her.
What?
Well, she's nice.
She's charming.
- She's caring.
- Yeah, good luck with that.
Are you allowed to pee in these suits?
Look at Steve.
He looks so stupid!
Here we go.
Ohh!
Aah!
God.
Oh, man!
Aah!
this is for you, Danny!
Danny!
Okay, okay.
You ready?
Okay, okay.
Okay, I got it!
Oh, Danny...
Danny...
Danny, you had a horrible life!
That's good.
spazzy Danny!
For spazzy Danny!
Ohh!
Oh!
Ohh!
Hey, Jim!
I know comedy!
We do, Jim!
We really do!
We get somebody to do this at every funeral!
Funky bunch strikes again, yo!
Boom!
That's for you, Danny.
Danny!
Danny!
Danny!
Danny!
Danny!
Danny!
Danny!
Danny!
Aah.
Well, well done.
Yeah, you got us.
It was very good.
Well done.
Oh, it was very sweet what you did.
Well, you're welcome.
I was hoping someone would go for a walk with me on the pier.
See you later.
Yeah, you got us pretty good.
Those ashes, that was, uh... that was a good joke.
It's always funny.
I-I just...
I just don't know what to say right now.
Look, Jim, I think you're a really great guy.
I'm really not.
Then why are you waiting so long to kiss me?
Look at her.
She's perfect.
She's funny.
She's pretty.
She's caring.
She might be the one.
I can't find a single problem with her.
Man!
Can you believe all these niggers?
You coming?
So, Jim, how are you feeling?
Dr. Pinsky told me that you are having some issues?
Dr. Pinsky?
Oh, that's Dr. Drew's real name.
Why wouldn't he just call himself Dr. Drew?
Drew's short for Andrew.
Yeah, but Dr. Pinsky's a good name.
Is Drew so snappy that he... what?
What... he got an ego on him, does he?
Does he like to be called after his first name?
Does he think he's Madonna or Cher or some...
Do you want to spend the whole session talking about Dr. Drew?
There you go.
Even you call him Dr. Drew.
He... he says I'm, uh...
I'm depressed.
Are you?
Well, my career is not where I want it to be, you know?
Um, I've sort of plateaued.
Actually, no, let's be honest.
It has dropped.
I live with my two friends Billy and Steve.
Um...
Billy has muscular dystrophy.
And, uh, Steve... he's drinking way too much.
So...
It's like I'm taking care of two disabled people.
Oh, while you're writing...
Dr. Drew thinks I'm a sex addict...
'Cause I wank on planes.
And he says that's wrong.
But I've never seen a sign that said not to.
Oh, the... the little "No Smoking" sign... that's always up there.
There's never been a "No Wanking" sign right next to it that bleeps on.
"Wanking...
you can't do it on the plane.
"We have detectors in the bathroom in case you do.
It's a federal offense."
I... you know, I don't see what the big problem is there.
It's not like I do it in my seat.
You know, Jim, while you're sorting through this rut, this funk of yours,
I think it would be good for you to be of service to others, not just your roommates.
I think you'll find it very rewarding.
I don't know about this whole therapy thing.
They don't really do anything.
They give you no practical advice.
Everything's just, like, talking.
It's like, "How does that make you feel?"
"Why would you do that?" "Please put that down."
"Does that make you angry?" You know?
Yeah, it makes me angry.
I'd rather just talk to you guys.
What's wrong with him?
Danny.
Spazzy Danny?
Yes, spazzy Danny.
What's up with spazzy Danny, besides muscular dystrophy?
He can't play video games anymore.
Why can't he play video games anymore?
- His thumbs.
- Thumbs?
Yeah.
You know, the thumbs are usually the last thing to go.
Billy, when did your thumbs stop working?
Stop it, Jim.
Billy's thumbs went years ago.
Billy used to go over there all the time and watch him play.
He was kind of like a coach to him.
Huh.
Well, I guess neither of them could play the Wii, so...
Steve, let's go.
- Jim, you're an asshole.
- You are.
Billy, I'm joking.
It was just a joke.
Where are you going?
I'm going over there to try to cheer him up.
Maybe I'll go over there and cheer him up.
How are you gonna cheer him up?
Welcome to the Shady Grove residential care comedy show.
I'm actually here to, uh, support my friend Danny here.
G'day, Danny.
Okay, so, there's two types of couples in the world, isn't there?
There's the couples that have dogs, you know... those annoying couples?
They have a dog.
And then there's the other couples that have actual children.
So, the people that have dogs, they act like it's their child, but it's really not their child, is it, 'cause what happens if the girlfriend's away on work and the dog dies?
What do you do?
You go off and buy another dog that looks very similar to the original dog, and you try to pass it off as the same dog.
No, no, no.
Rodney, mate, that's, uh...
that's not the end of the joke.
Okay.
You sure?
Pr... yeah.
Yep.
Sure.
So, okay, so, you go off and buy a dog looks very similar to the original dog, try to pass it off as the same dog.
But what happens if your girlfriend's away on work and the baby dies?
_
Hilarious!
No, that's... please, Rodney, n...
I get it!
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.
- That's not the end.
- Yes, it is.
Look.
When the joke ends,
I'll make it very obvious, but don't laugh until I...
I'll point it out, okay?
I'll give you a signal, and then laugh.
So I'll go like this, and then you laugh.
Not now!
At the end of the joke.
So don't do it right now when I do that.
But I'll...
I'll be...
Some of his best stuff.
- He's shit!
- All right, let's just wrap this up.
The dog's already dead.
They replaced the dog.
So what happens if your girlfriend goes away on work and the baby dies?
Very hard to get a baby that looks exactly the same in the short period of time that you have.
All right, Danny's getting it.
Yeah.
Yeah, eas... easier if they're black or Asian.
Hey!
Hey, Danny, don't be racist.
I'm not saying 'cause they look the same.
I'm saying 'cause they're easier to purchase.
Crash cart to the rec room, stat.
Am I right?
If... if Angelina Jolie and Madonna has taught us anything, it's that you can buy black and Asian...
- Hey!
Hey!
- Children.
- Stop talking.
- Oxygen.
- Danny?
Yeah, look, uh, I want to point out that
- Shut up!
- that's not a racist joke.
- It's more of a commentary on society.
- Breathe.
Danny, come on.
- Jim, stop it!
- I'm not racist, so you know.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Take a breath.
Breathe.
Thank God Danny saved me.
I was dying.
Danny, breathe!
Danny.
He's gone.
- I killed.
- Stop it.
Laughter is the best medicine.
You kill him!
That was the last one... last one in my original group.
There were six of us.
We all got diagnosed around the same time, shared the same pain, same trials.
We really bonded.
All five of them are dead.
"The Funky Bunch."
Oh, that's right.
I'm sorry, Rodney?
They were called "The Funky Bunch."
"Funky Bunch?"
Marky Mark was very popular at the time.
Of course.
That's why you were called "The Funky Bunch."
We were 14!
Stop!
"The Funky Bunch" is over!
Honey?
Honey, I just heard.
Are you okay?
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, mom, it happened so suddenly.
I mean, Jim was just up there telling jokes,
- and then...
- Jim, you killed Danny?
No.
No, I went down there to help.
I was doing a show.
That's all.
What was the joke?
Walter!
What?
I want to know!
The one where Angelina Jolie buys blacks.
And the Asians.
That's a good one.
Walter!
That's a good j... you got any beer?
The fridge.
He killed him, Walter!
No, he didn't, mom.
Danny was old!
He was like 34!
He never should've lived past 30!
Good one.
Nice, Steve.
Now, every day that
Billy's still with us, it's a blessing and a curse, I'll tell you.
You know, on the one hand, he's around so we can enjoy him, but on the other,
the poor guy's suffering.
Yeah, dad, we get it.
"Billy's suffering.
Billy lost his friend."
Stevie boy... don't "Stevie boy" me, dad.
What is the matter with you?
I'll tell you what's the matter with me.
I'm sick and tired of everybody pretending like Billy's the only one with problems.
Oh, Steve, everybody is well-aware that you have problems... huge problems!
Yeah, but yours are self-inflicted, Steve.
That's a funny one, Jim.
Yeah, I get it.
"Yeah, Steve can take it." Yeah.
Oh, come on, Steve.
No, you come on, Jim!
You know I've been dealing with this shit my whole life?
And all I ever ask for is for for was somebody to just listen maybe,
- maybe even empathize a little!
- Mom, please, I just want to be alone.
Oh, honey, Steve doesn't mean it.
He's an idiot.
Mom...
Alone.
Okay.
Okay.
I didn't get a normal childhood, dad.
We never went on a normal vacation.
We never went camping, to an amusement park!
We didn't go anywhere that didn't have a ramp!
Look, Steve.
Steve, I'm sorry.
I...
I really tried, but...
I once had that idea for a theme park.
Jesus.
- Ramp world.
- Oh, God.
Oh, yeah.
You go up, you go down just like life!
It's exactly like life.
- Just shut the hell up, dad, please.
- Ah, ramp world.
Stop encouraging him.
Oh, could've been millionaires.
Jesus, God, dad, shut the hell up, please!
That's, uh, still a good idea.
You know I've seen Jerry Lewis live seven times?
Never seen him at ramp world.
Shut up!
- Well...
- There's times I thought that I knew Jerry Lewis better than I knew my own dad!
Ah, Steve, you've seen me more than seven times!
You know how many times I prayed that I'd get sick just so I could get some attention?
- Ohh, man!
- Jesus.
Really, Steve?
No, not really.
I don't want to be sick.
That shit sucks.
- But the point is that sometimes...
- I got to go.
I got... you guys make me feel like I'm not even here!
I got to go check on Billy.
Just...
- Okay?
- Oh, there you go.
Thanks for proving my point, Jim.
All right, look.
A half-hour, we're gonna go watch some cartoons.
What do you think?
Well, your mother's a wonderful woman!
The stuff she's done for you kids over the years...
- She's gone home, Walter.
- Oh, thank God.
Hey, buddy.
Dad and I were just having a little chat.
Yeah.
I heard.
Look, uh...
Emotions are running a little bit high.
Rodney...
Could you, could you grab us some beers, please, buddy?
Yes, sir!
All right.
Life, huh?
Hey, it's tough everywhere.
Ah.
Thank you, Rodney.
You got this brutal thing going on.
You know, I've been living with your mother for 38 years.
Steve lost his wife and kid.
And Jim... he's nowhere near having a grounded human existence.
No wife, no kids, nothing.
This guy's like the black hole of humanity.
But at the end of the day,
I'd say he might be the luckiest of us all.
Thanks, Walter.
Let me draw it for you.
Oh, God.
Here we go.
All right, now
This line...
Represents blowjobs.
This line...
Is time.
Over here, we have money.
Cashola, moola.
This line...
Represents relationships.
Now, over time, the more money we spend
we cause the lines to intersect, which represents
Children.
Now, at the end of all this
We have
Death.
And as we lie in our coffin
Our wives dance on top with everything that's left.
Now, that's heterosexual.
Homosexual... blowjobs, money.
The two lines never intersect.
They got it made in the shade!
Dad, what does this mean?
"Rodney and Dokken were here."
Well, I did what you asked me to do.
I went down to a home to do some shows for a bunch of MDs and disabled people, and one of them had a heart attack and died.
How'd it make you feel?
When spazzy Danny died?
You can call him Danny.
I'm going to say...
Sad.
The funeral's coming up.
I don't think I'm gonna go.
Why not?
People don't want the killers of their children at the funeral.
And, plus, Danny's not my friend.
He was my friend's friend.
Well, don't you think it would be nice to go with your friend to support him?
I mean, it would be the nice, kind, compassionate thing to do.
Maybe I could go and tell a few jokes...
Kill a few more of them off.
Is this gonna be a big funeral?
I don't know.
Pretty big.
I think a lot of people are gonna be there.
"The Funky Bunch" won't.
Oh, shut up, Rodney.
But they won't.
After the viewing, he's being cremated.
Yeah?
Where are they spreading his ashes?
The ocean.
He really loved the water, which reminds me of a favor I need to ask.
Because none of us can swim,
I was hoping that you guys could do it.
- No, no.
- No, no, no.
No way.
Not gonna happen, mate.
That's not my responsibility.
But you killed him, Jim.
This is true.
I want to be spread on a sandwich.
- Why is it so hot in here?
- It's the devil, man.
Hey, Jerry, no cuts!
Hey, come on!
What are you doing?
Look at the little bastard.
He's cutting!
Yeah, but, Steve, we're at a funeral, right?
We're not at the DMV.
We're not at "Six Flags."
Who gives a shit?
It doesn't matter.
It's the principle.
Look at how he's cutting.
Yeah, you're right.
Hey, Jerry, you dick licker, get to the back of the line!
You kill him!
He did not.
Yeah, he did!
Steve!
Why do they keep saying that I killed him?
I didn't kill anyone.
Ah, they're just on edge.
It's a funeral, man.
Tell you what, though these disabled funerals are the best, man.
You know, 'cause the chicks are sad, but they're not too sad, because they saw it coming, you know?
And they're emotional, but they're not so emotional that a couple wine coolers and a little loving wouldn't cheer them up.
- Okay, Jerry, that's enough.
At the beginning of that sentence,
I thought you were disgusting, but maybe you're right.
Dude, let go.
Yeah, I've been to a lot of these things.
Ever been laid at one?
Nope.
Okay.
Jesus.
This is taking too long.
Who is that girl?
Okay.
Let go of her right now.
It's Danny's sister, Sara.
Sara.
I bet her name's spelled S-a-r-a.
What?
Bet there's no "h" on the end.
You put the "h" on the end of a girl's name, it adds like 30 pounds.
See, Sara, S-a-r-a... hot girl.
Sarah, S-a-r-a-h... it's a fat chick.
Are you kidding me?
Look at this guy.
He's cooling off by the body, and we're sweating over here.
It's not just... not just girls' names.
Boys' names.
Noah...
I never met a thin Noah.
Ralph's a fat prick.
Isn't he?
I'm sorry for your loss.
Look at this guy giving me the stink eye!
Who does he think he is?
Bring it.
I have to meet that girl.
She's amazing.
I told you, man... disabled funerals.
Danny and I grew up together.
We played together.
He was the 67th best "Halo" player in the world for a while.
In many ways, he was the brother I never had.
What?
It's true.
ｶ Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow ｶ
ｶ 'Tis I'll be here ｶ
What's the matter?
ｶ In sunshine or in shadow ｶ
It looks like he's just sitting in front of fun.
You're right.
ｶ Oh, Danny boy ｶ
ｶ Oh, Danny boy ｶ
- I love you so.
- ｶ I love you so ｶ
Ladies and gentlemen,
"The Funky Bunch" no more.
Come on!
Feel the vibration!
Hey, there.
Oh, hi.
Um, I'm...
I-I... sorry, I didn't say hello.
I'm...
I'm Jim.
Hi, Jim.
Sara.
I'm sorry for...
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.
I'm...
Danny's sister.
I guess I'm nobody.
- Steve!
- Eh.
Look, he's upset, you know?
This has really hit home for us, what with Billy, and...
I...
I'm really sorry about your brother.
Well, you should be.
From what I hear, you're the one who killed him.
Why does everyone...
I didn't kill anyone!
- You kill him!
- Shut up, Jerry!
I went down there to entertain him.
It's not your fault.
You were just telling bad jokes.
Not bad jokes... good jokes!
- Bad jokes!
- Bad audience!
- People that don't know comedy!
- I know comedy!
He does, Jim.
He really does.
Shut up, Rodney.
I can't tell if I'm drunk or just sad.
Yeah, probably both.
He just started taking an experimental drug.
It seemed to be helping.
Hope it didn't kill him.
So...
Danny told me you took Billy to a brothel?
Yes.
That's great.
- That makes me happy.
- Really?
I could never have done that for my brother, so I just used to blow him.
It's okay.
He was adopted.
- I'm kidding!
- Oh!
Come on.
Who adopts disabled kids?
No one would.
You kill him.
Yeah so that's...
Ah, you're great!
You're great!
Jim, I've really enjoyed talking to you, but I got to go.
I got to find someone to scatter these ashes, so...
I can do that for you.
Really?
Yeah, I can do that!
Hey, Jim.
Hey, Ramona.
Excuse me.
I have to go.
She's great.
Yeah, she's a piece of work.
You know, I had to go to a psychiatrist to tell me to be nice to people.
You just do it, mate.
Here.
You've been taking care of Billy...
For 30 years.
You think he doesn't notice that?
You think your parents don't notice that?
I definitely notice it.
You've done something worthwhile with your life.
Well, it's kind of hard to feel good about anything right now.
But I don't know how to help you, you know?
I-I... there's nothing I can do.
It's easy for me to help Billy.
Y-you just got to keep him clean.
You feed him.
You wash him.
You help him go to the bathroom.
But with you, I don't know what to do.
Maybe it's worse to be hurt in the head, eh?
Yeah, I don't know about that, Jim, but thanks, man.
When's Sara getting here?
Don't worry.
She'll be here.
You like her, don't you?
Like her?
I think I love her.
- Oh, God.
- What's not to like, man?
Where have you been?
The reading of the will.
Yeah?
You get anything good?
He left me his video-game collection.
I have his hula hoop.
I'm gonna wear it as a belt.
Great, something you can both use.
Maybe.
Come on, Billy.
No, I'm serious.
I'm thinking about taking that drug.
Danny took it.
I-it could've killed him.
What?
Well, Sara was talking...
You talking about me?
Nah.
It's really great that you're doing this for us.
I'm a helper.
That's what I do.
Well, I'll be waiting for you up there when you get back.
Thank you.
I'll just carry your brother!
Unbelievable.
I think I love her.
What?
Well, she's nice.
She's charming.
- She's caring.
- Yeah, good luck with that.
Are you allowed to pee in these suits?
Look at Steve.
He looks so stupid!
Here we go.
Ohh!
Aah!
God.
Oh, man!
Aah!
This is for you, Danny!
Danny!
Okay, okay.
You ready?
Okay, okay.
Okay, I got it!
Oh, Danny...
Danny...
Danny, you had a horrible life!
That's good.
Spazzy Danny!
For spazzy Danny!
Ohh!
Oh!
Ohh!
Hey, Jim!
I know comedy!
We do, Jim!
We really do!
We get somebody to do this at every funeral!
"Funky Bunch" strikes again, yo!
Boom!
That's for you, Danny.
Danny!
Danny!
Danny!
Danny!
Danny!
Danny!
Danny!
Danny!
Aah.
Well, well done.
Yeah, you got us.
It was very good.
Well done.
Oh, it was very sweet what you did.
Well, you're welcome.
I was hoping someone would go for a walk with me on the pier.
See you later.
Yeah, you got us pretty good.
Those ashes, that was, uh... that was a good joke.
It's always funny.
I-I just...
I just don't know what to say right now.
Look, Jim, I think you're a really great guy.
I'm really not.
Then why are you waiting so long to kiss me?
Look at her.
She's perfect.
She's funny.
She's pretty.
She's caring.
She might be the one.
I can't find a single problem with her.
Man!
Can you believe all these niggers?
You coming?
Caversham Manor in Berkshire.
The year is 1219.
William Marshall is the most powerful knight in the land and Regent of England.
The 11-year-old boy at his bedside is the fourth Plantagenet king to rule England -
Henry III.
The Plantagenets were a French Dynasty, who ruled England and much of France for 50 years.
But Henry's father, King John, had lost most of their lands in France.
And when Henry came to the throne at the age of nine, half of England was under French occupation.
William Marshall had sworn to protect the young king.
"Even if the whole world abandons the boy," he said,
"I will not fail him."
William Marshall kept his word.
He defeated the French, fought off the rebellious English barons, and ensured that the young Plantagenet would hold on to his crown.
But now, William Marshall was dying and the fate of the Plantagenets rested on the shoulders of a child.
Many predicted disaster.
Instead, something remarkable happened.
The Plantagenet dynasty not only survived, it grew stronger.
Under their rule, over the next 150 years, medieval England reached its peak.
Parliament was born and a clear sense of national identity emerged.
Their roots were in France, French was their language, but the Plantagenet family helped foster a new sense of English nationhood.
Out of their dynastic ambitions would grow an English empire.
For the first 50 years of Plantagenet rule, the English Channel acted as a bridge, connecting the king and his barons to the lands they owned in France.
But, by the reign of Henry III, most of their ancestral homelands in France had been lost.
The English barons were forced to make a commitment to one side of the Channel or the other.
The kings of England and France presented the barons with a stark choice - give up their lands in England and do homage to the King of France or give up their lands in France and swear allegiance to the King of England.
The Channel was no longer a bridge, but a barrier between competing powers.
Possession of French lands always drove the Plantagenet dynasty but, for now, they turned their energies to the country they still ruled - to England.
Henry III was not by nature a warrior.
The Boy King grew up to be a pious ruler, devoted to pilgrimage and prayer.
In 1245, he began rebuilding Westminster Abbey, a project that would occupy him for the rest of his life.
The old Romanesque Basilica was replaced with an immense gothic structure.
This was an architecture of light and sophistication.
The style was French but it was dedicated to the memory of an English king.
The majesty of Westminster Abbey today is the result of Henry III's devotion to Edward the Confessor and his desire to glorify him.
Henry saw Westminster as the centre of the Plantagenet kingdom, and in the heart of the abbey itself, he constructed an elaborate new shrine to the saintly Anglo-Saxon king.
Edward the Confessor is the only English king to have been canonised.
Henry was aligning himself with both God and England.
Edward's golden coffin sat on base of Purbeck marble.
These niches were carved for pilgrims to kneel in prayer.
But the Abbey also served a worldly purpose.
Henry's piety hadn't extinguished his dynastic ambition.
He wanted Westminster Abbey to rival the great churches of the French Kings.
His vision of the Abbey was as the place of coronation and burial for all future Plantagenet kings.
Westminster Abbey would be forever associated with Henry, as his crowning achievement.
But Plantagenet ambition came at a price.
Its rebuilding cost more than twice Henry's annual royal income.
And he had other expensive plans.
Like all his predecessors, Henry was determined to expand his Plantagenet empire, whatever the cost.
Henry wasn't a warrior king, but he could use the revenues of England to add to the Plantagenet dominions.
The Pope was inviting Henry to purchase the rights to the Kingdom of Sicily, and he couldn't refuse the chance to add to the family's lands.
He accepted on behalf of his younger son, Edmund.
The only snag was the price tag.
We know what happened next, because of a contemporary account of Henry's reign.
Kept at Corpus Christi College Cambridge is a manuscript written and illustrated by a St Albans monk, Matthew Paris.
It's called the Chronica Majora, The Great Chronicle.
He tells us Henry agreed to pay the Pope three times his annual income, for the chance to secure Sicily as a Plantagenet land.
It was a huge sum of money, and a great risk.
If Henry defaulted on payment, he faced excommunication from the Church.
For a pious man like Henry, excommunication would be unbearable, but still he pursued the policy.
Even his own brother thought he'd gone mad.
He compared the Pope's offer to a man saying,
"I sell you the moon, now climb up and take it."
It was an ambitious plan to expand Plantagenet power, but it placed royal family interests against those of the barons, and it backfired badly.
The barons were the land-owning nobility of England.
They provided the King with armies to fight his wars.
And he needed their agreement to raise taxes to fund his ambitions.
Yet Henry was alienating his barons by pursuing Sicily.
And they held another grievance against the King.
Henry had filled his court with foreign-born relatives from Savoy and Poitou.
The barons bitterly resented them.
French remained the language of court, but there was a growing suspicion of all things foreign.
Plantagenet dynastic ambitions were still international, but they increasingly came up against a new force - national feeling.
You can see it in the works of Matthew Paris.
Here he shows a French invasion fleet being defeated by English forces.
While the bishops bless those who are fighting, as it says,
"for the liberation of England".
And here he praises a patriotic baron, who would struggle to preserve Anglia Anglis.
England for the English.
National feeling was a growing force Henry couldn't ignore.
He'd taken a huge risk in mortgaging his kingdom to expand a Plantagenet empire in the Mediterranean.
But now, he was bankrupt and the English barons were on the point of rebellion.
Things came to a head one April morning in 1258.
Seven barons in full armour confronted Henry, here in Westminster Hall.
The King was startled, "What is this, my Lords, am I your captive?"
They reassured him that they were not rebels, but friends of the Crown, but they insisted that the King dismiss his foreign relatives and take back their castle and lands.
The King's relatives protested noisily, but the barons warned them, "Know for a fact
"that you will either return the castles or lose your head."
Henry had little choice but to agree.
The King's submission to the barons triggered a chain of reforming legislation that would transform the way England was governed.
The reforms would be agreed by a committee of 24, 12 chosen by the King and 12 by the barons.
For the first time in English history, power would be shared by the King with a 15-member council.
These historic reforms are known as the Provisions of Oxford.
Medieval kings had always claimed to rule by the grace of God, but Henry now reluctantly swore an oath to share power with the barons, in the name of le Commune d'Angleterre, the Community of England.
Provoked by Plantagenet extravagance, the Provisions of Oxford mark an important moment in the history of England, and of the limitation of royal power.
For 20 years, the assemblies where the King consulted with his bishops and barons had been known by a term derived from the French, "parler", to talk.
This gave us the name of a new institution, Parliament.
Henry appealed to the Pope to extricate himself from the Provisions of Oxford.
But his own brother-in-law, Simon De Montford, condemned Henry as a king who had lost touch with his people.
De Montfort saw himself as England's saviour.
The King knew he was in danger.
He told De Montfort,
"I fear thunder and lightning beyond measure, but by God's head.
"I dread you more than all the thunder and lightning in the world."
He was right to be afraid.
From his base here in Kenilworth Castle,
De Montfort raised an army against the King.
In 1264, Simon De Montfort confronted royal troops, led by the King and his son Prince Edward, outside Lewes.
De Montfort's men were outnumbered, but they inflicted a humiliating defeat on Henry, and took Prince Edward prisoner.
Henry remained king in name only.
For the next 15 months, England was ruled, not by a Plantagenet, but by Simon De Montfort.
And he did so through Parliament.
De Montfort's Parliament of 1265 is often regarded as the forerunner of the modern Parliament.
As always, it included barons and bishops, who sit nowadays as the House of Lords.
But for the first time, knights and burgesses were sent from the Shires and from the Boroughs, elected to Parliament by the property owners of England.
Parliament now had the beginnings of a second House, later to be known as The Commons.
Henry III seemed to be a spent force, but his son Edward was a warrior, prepared to defend his Plantagenet birthright to the death.
With the help of men loyal to his cause,
Edward escaped his captivity in Hereford.
He raised an army and confronted De Montfort at Evesham.
At the battle of Evesham,
Edward re-asserted Plantagenet rule in England.
De Montfort's supporters were slaughtered and De Montfort himself killed in the battle.
His hands and feet were cut off.
His testicles severed and hung scornfully over his nose.
Then his head was sent to the wife of one of his chief enemies.
De Montfort's rule was over.
But the English Parliament lived on, and future Plantagenet kings would ignore it at their peril.
Henry had had a lucky escape.
He returned to the life of religious devotion and pilgrimage.
He'd gambled with the Plantagenet crown, and his actions had provoked the opening up of Parliament to elected representatives of the English people.
Henry's England had a growing sense of national spirit.
But when he died, Henry revealed his own true allegiance.
Henry's body was laid to rest in Westminster Abbey, to spend eternity alongside his beloved Anglo-Saxon hero,
Edward the Confessor.
But his heart was sent to be buried with his Plantagenet ancestors, at the Abbey of Fontevraud in Anjou.
An English King, but a French heart, a Plantagenet to the last.
Edward, the warrior prince, now became King Edward I of England.
Tall and intimidating, with a mop of curly hair,
Edward was known as Longshanks.
He inherited a country recovering from turmoil.
Edward also inherited the famous Plantagenet temper.
Reputedly he once frightened an unfortunate Archbishop of York, literally to death.
But he'd learned two things from his father's mistakes - to keep the barons happy, and not to run out of money.
And he sought to find ways to attain both those goals.
Like his ancestors, Edward encouraged the planning of new towns to generate wealth and taxes.
Towns like Hull and Winchelsea nurtured a new society based on trade, and trade became the lifeblood of the Plantagenet dynasty.
Medieval England reached its economic peak under Edward I.
But there was a darker side to its growing sense of national identity.
England's Jewish population had arrived from France shortly after the Norman Conquest.
The Pope had decreed that lending money at interest was a sin for Christians, so the Jews became the chief source of credit for the King and his barons.
Jews were often resented, they were frequently persecuted and attacked.
And by the reign of Edward I, in this age of crusades,
England had become an increasingly militant Christian nation.
The King himself was a conventional Christian with no sympathy for the plight of the Jews.
At a time when English national feeling was growing,
Edward's vision of England was a fiercely Christian one - this England had no place for the Jews.
With the support of his barons, Edward decided to expel the entire Jewish population from his realm.
Some 2,000-3,000 Jews departed from the shores of England.
There was to be no resident Jewish population in the country for the next 370 years.
Yet Plantagenet ambitions always extended beyond England.
Edward was inspired by King Arthur, a popular figure in folklore, who was said to have once ruled over a united Britain.
Edward wanted to align the Plantagenet dynasty with this legendary, all-conquering leader.
And he had the conquest of Wales in his sights.
Wales had troubled the Plantagenet kings for generations, its rugged terrain made it hard to conquer and control, and they regarded its inhabitants as little more than barbarians.
But Edward I was a man who never gave up what he saw as his rights.
And these included, in his eyes, overlordship of Wales.
But a rival dynasty stood in the way of Plantagenet ambition.
The Princes of Gwynedd had ruled here for centuries.
Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, and his younger brother Dyfed, were the latest in a long line of warrior leaders who held a crown said to be King Arthur's.
Edward's father Henry, recognised Llywelyn as Prince of Wales, as long as he paid homage to the English crown.
But when Edward took the throne, Llywelyn refused to pay homage.
Edward declared Llywelyn a rebel and a disturber of the peace.
And in 1277 set off westward from Chester at the head of a powerful army of 800 knights, crossbow men from Gascony and 16,000 infantry.
Along the way, they were supplied by a fleet of ships sent up from the royal ports of the south coast, like Winchelsea.
The Welsh were hopelessly outnumbered.
Edward's army captured Anglesey, the bread basket of Wales.
At a stroke, this provided food for his own men and cut off supplies to the Welsh.
Llywelyn had no choice but to surrender and pay homage to Edward.
An uneasy truce followed.
But it was broken, when Dafydd ap Gruffydd led a new rebellion against English rule.
For over a year, the Plantagenet army clashed with Welsh defenders.
But in 1282, disaster struck for the Welsh dynasty.
Llywelyn was killed in battle.
His head cut off and sent to London.
Dafydd ap Gruffydd held out here at Dolbadarn Castle for a few months more.
Finally he was captured and tried by the English.
Condemned to death as the last survivor of a family of traitors, he was hanged and then cut down and disembowelled, his entrails were burned in front of him, his body was quartered and then his head was cut off
and sent to the Tower of London to be displayed alongside that of his brother.
As a final act of ritual humiliation the Welsh surrendered to the English King the crown of King Arthur.
Wales was now a Plantagenet dominion.
Edward had confronted a rival dynasty, and emerged victorious.
Now, to stamp his authority, he began building and repairing a chain of castles across North Wales.
These fortresses represent the peak of medieval castle building.
Edward personally chose the site for each of his castles, and the most impressive of all arose above the River Seiont at Caernarfon.
This twin-towered gatehouse, known as the King's Gate, was built according to the designs of King Edward himself.
The approach to the castle was guarded by arrow slits, and by spy holes.
And once here, you would have been confronted with a drawbridge, six portcullises and five sets of gates.
This was Plantagenet military architecture at its most intimidating.
Edward engaged the most famous castle architect in Europe.
Master James of St George.
King Edward was keen to associate the Plantagenet dynasty with the glories of the Christian Roman empire.
And so he commanded Master James to base his designs on the great walls of Constantinople.
This meant building many-sided towers instead of the more usual round ones.
The walls are up to 20-feet thick, and patterned with bands of coloured stone, a byzantine design not previously seen in the British Isles.
Caernarfon Castle was a bold statement of Plantagenet domination.
For the Welsh it was a painful reminder of conquest and oppression.
Edward was also preparing for the future, and laying a Plantagenet dynastic claim to Wales.
In 1284, the King's 11th child, a son named Edward, was born here.
At the age of 16, Edward of Caernarfon would be declared Prince of Wales, a title stolen from Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, which has been borne by the eldest son of the English sovereign ever since.
It looked at one point as though Scotland would go the way of Wales, swallowed up by the English kingdom.
But a different dynastic problem had arisen there.
When the King of Scotland died in 1286, he left no male heir.
The bloodline of Scottish kings was broken.
The dead king's three-year-old granddaughter,
Margaret of Norway, was next in line for the throne.
Edward came up with a neat Plantagenet solution.
Margaret would return to Scotland to marry his own infant son.
The situation would be resolved by diplomacy in marriage, not by war.
And Britain would be united under the Plantagenets.
It remains one of the great "what ifs" of British history.
No marriage took place, little Margaret died in Orkney on her way to Scotland, and with her, died Edward's plan for a bloodless Plantagenet takeover of Scotland.
After the death of Margaret, Edward agreed to tolerate a subordinate king in Scotland.
But as soon as he showed signs of independence,
Edward reacted with typical Plantagenet brutality.
His troops sacked Berwick and defeated a Scottish army at Dunbar.
English garrisons and officials were installed across Scotland to intimidate and control.
For Edward, the Kingdom of Scotland had ceased to exist.
As he handed the royal seal of Scotland to one of his barons he said, "A man does good business when he rids himself of a turd."
But Scotland did not go the way of Wales.
This wasn't a battle between dynasties, but between two countries with a growing sense of national identity and pride.
No-one displayed this more than one of the Scottish resistance leaders,
William Wallace.
Wallace was a proud and charismatic figure.
He refused to pay homage to Edward.
To crush Wallace, the English army had to cross the River Forth.
On a 13th century map of Britain, by Matthew Paris,
Scotland is shown dramatically divided by the River Forth.
And the only place to cross was the bridge at Stirling.
It was here that William Wallace confronted the English army, to preserve Scotland's freedom.
At this time, the bridge here was just wide enough for the English forces to cross two abreast.
Once half the army had crossed, the Scots swooped down and cut off the bridge.
The English stranded on the Northern bank were surrounded.
The result was slaughter.
Around 5,000 English infantrymen died at Stirling Bridge.
The battle didn't decide the issue, but Wallace's defiance shook Edward.
International dynasties, like the Plantagenets, struggled to understand national feeling.
Edward underestimated the strength of resistance it could produce.
He was riding to confront another Scottish leader, Robert Bruce, when he died in 1307.
Plantagenet determination to subdue Scotland was undiminished.
But Edward II's defeat by Robert Bruce at Bannockburn seven years later, set the limits to Plantagenet ambitions in Britain.
They would never conquer the Scots.
And they provoked a deepening of Scottish national pride, and a sense of independence that survives to this day.
The new Plantagenet king lacked his father's warrior instincts.
Edward II preferred gardening to fighting.
He would fail to build on his father's legacy, and his lapses of judgement would threaten to destroy the Plantagenet dynasty.
Edward's reign began well.
He secured a great prize in the marriage market,
Isabella, daughter of the King of France.
She was just 12 years old, but already considered a beauty of beauties and very wise.
A month after their wedding,
Westminster Abbey was the setting for Edward's coronation.
This was his first opportunity to show off his new Queen.
Instead, Isabella was upstaged.
As Edward and Isabella walked down the aisle, it wasn't the young Queen who caught the eye.
Walking just ahead of them and leading the procession was a young man called Piers Gaveston.
He was dressed in clothes of imperial purple, studded with pearls.
And in his hands he cradled the crown of St Edward the Confessor, the most sacred of the royal regalia.
There was no more privileged position in the royal procession.
Gaveston was being honoured as the most important noble in the land.
At the banquet that followed,
Edward and Gaveston shocked the guests with their display of affection for each other.
Isabella's uncles walked out in disgust.
Every medieval king had court favourites, but none had ever achieved the power and influence Piers Gaveston exercised over Edward II.
The King claimed he loved him like a brother.
But the St Paul's chronicler noted that the King frequented.
Piers's couch more than the Queen's.
We can never know for sure if there was a sexual relationship between Edward II and Piers Gaveston, but we do know that there are no mentions of homosexuality during their lifetimes, and they had plenty of enemies who would have brought it up.
The earliest references come after Edward's downfall, and from men who were deeply hostile to him.
What can't be doubted is that Edward was infatuated with Gaveston, to a degree that compromised his Kingship, and provoked the baron's hatred.
But Gaveston displayed no fear of the barons.
Famed for his quick and sarcastic tongue,
Gaveston gave the barons nicknames.
The Earl of Lancaster was The Fiddler.
The Earl of Lincoln, Burstbelly,
And the Earl of Warwick, whose seat was here at Warwick Castle, was the Black Dog of Arden.
But this was a dangerous game.
The Black Dog could bite.
Once again, the Plantagenet rule was under threat because of foreign-born court favourites.
Once again, the barons felt compelled to act.
Gaveston was captured and put in the custody of the Earl of Pembroke who guaranteed his safety.
But in his absence, the Black Dog pounced.
The Earl of Warwick seized Gaveston.
After a token trial, he was led out on the road to Kenilworth.
When they reached Blacklow Hill, here on the land of the Earl of Lancaster,
Gaveston was first stabbed and then beheaded.
His body was left on the hillside until claimed by two Dominican friars.
"And that was the end of Piers," commented a contemporary chronicler,
"who had risen on high, but now fell into nothingness."
If Edward had now concentrated his energies on being king, his infatuation with Gaveston might have been quickly forgotten.
Instead, to Isabella's horror, he began to shower favours on another young noble -
Hugh Dispenser.
Dispenser and Edward became inseparable.
Angry barons said he bewitched the King's mind.
But Dispenser made an enemy yet more dangerous than the barons -
Edward's Queen, Isabella.
Isabella came to despise Dispenser, in the words of a contemporary chronicle, "with a more than perfect hatred".
But Edward still needed Isabella.
In 1324, the French invaded Gascony, the last of the Plantagenet lands in France.
Isabella's brother was now the King of France, so Edward asked his wife to travel to Paris to sue for peace.
Isabella's brother welcomed her warmly, and promised to restore Gascony on condition that Edward did homage for the Duchy.
With his barons threatening rebellion at home,
Edward was reluctant to leave England, but he sent his son in his place.
And so here, at the Chateau de Vincennes outside Paris, in the company of his mother, the young Edward knelt at the feet of Charles IV of France.
But then, instead of returning to England, he remained in France with his mother.
When Edward requested their return, Isabella refused.
She finally revealed her feelings about her husband's relationship with Hugh Dispenser.
"I feel that marriage is a joining together of man and woman,
"and someone has come between my husband and me,
"trying to break this bond."
Edwards's letters to his son became increasingly violent.
"We will take such measures that you will feel it
"all the days of your life, and all other sons will learn what it means
"to disobey their lords and fathers."
A Plantagenet family crisis was about to turn into a political disaster.
News reached the king that the rebel baron Roger Mortimer was now Isabella's lover.
According to the Bishop of Hereford, Edward determined to strike back with true Plantagenet vindictiveness.
If he had no other weapon, he would crush her with his teeth.
Isabella and Mortimer landed on the Suffolk coast, and quickly found support from disaffected barons.
Edward's cause was lost.
Hugh Dispenser paid the price for his closeness to the king.
He was tied to a ladder and his genitals sliced off.
His entrails were removed, and along with his heart, thrown into a fire.
The King was taken prisoner.
According to the English chronicler Geoffrey Le Baker, the imprisoned king was told that if he refused to abdicate in favour of his son, someone other than a Plantagenet would take the throne.
Weeping and barely able to stand,
Edward eventually agreed to sacrifice himself for his dynasty.
He stood down in favour of his son, the first abdication of a King of England.
But the Plantagenet bloodline had been protected.
On the 1st of February, 1327, his son, Prince Edward, was crowned.
He was 14 years old.
His mother, Isabella, was appointed regent.
She and Mortimer now ruled England on Edward's behalf.
But a deposed former king was a new dynastic problem.
Edward was brought here, to Berkeley Castle, and these are original documents from the castle at that time.
Here we read about the delivery of chickens to the kitchen of the King's father, which is what Edward now was.
And here is a record of his daily expenses -
£5 a day, quite a generous amount.
And here is a report of a messenger being sent to Nottingham to inform Isabella concerning "morte patris regis".
The death of the king's father.
The death of Edward II solved Isabella and Mortimer's problems.
But there were already questions about how Edward died.
And killing a king was an offence against God and the natural order.
The most plausible cause of death to be suggested was suffocation, but other, more lurid accounts soon circulated.
Within 30 years, Geoffrey Le Baker and other chroniclers were writing that Edward had had a red-hot poker inserted into his anus.
It's no surprise which version has caught the public imagination.
No-one knows for sure, but with either the red-hot poker or suffocation, no mark would be visible, when the king's body was displayed to show that he was truly dead.
To all appearances, Edward II died of natural causes.
The fate of the Plantagenet dynasty now lay in the hands of Isabella and Roger Mortimer.
But three years later, tired of the corrupt rule of his mother and her lover, the young King Edward decided to take action.
One night in October 1330, two dozen supporters of the young King crept through a secret tunnel.
Above, in Nottingham castle, slept Isabella and Roger Mortimer.
The leader of the conspirators warned the young King,
"It is better to eat the dog than to be eaten by the dog."
But Mortimer hadn't got to rule England without a killer's instincts.
The King's supporters knew that if their plans failed, they would be hanged as traitors.
The young conspirators entered the castle and made for the queen's bedchamber.
As they drew their swords and entered,
Edward stood quietly outside the room.
Suspecting her son's presence, Isabella called out,
"Good son, good son, have mercy on noble Mortimer."
But there was to be no mercy,
Mortimer was taken to the Tower of London, and within a few weeks he was hanged like an ordinary criminal.
And out of the shadow of his mother and her lover stepped the new Plantagenet King.
Edward III.
In the uncertain world of medieval politics people looked to omens and portents for guidance.
One place they found it was in ancient prophesies about the fates and fortunes of kings.
The prophecy of the Six Kings drew on the legend of King Arthur.
In it, Merlin characterised the future Plantagenet Kings as animals.
Henry III was a pious lamb, Edward I a battling dragon,
Edward II was a lascivious goat, but his son, who would grow up to be Edward III, was a glorious wild boar with the heart of a lion, who would conquer more than any of his blood in this world.
The message was clear -
England once again had a Plantagenet king to rally behind.
Edward III would not make the mistakes of his father.
He set out to unify the English barons around him, and at his birthplace, Windsor Castle, he spent a royal fortune, transforming it into the heart of his kingdom.
He turned it from a castle into a palace.
It became the most expensive single building project by any Plantagenet king, and the perfect setting for royal displays of chivalry.
Under Edward III, the rituals of chivalry became central to the Plantagenet court.
Chivalry was a code of behaviour that proudly fused military and Christian ethics.
The word refers to the customs and values of the Chevaliers, the French term for those who rode into battle, the knights.
And it demanded that these knights be brave, loyal and devoted to their ladies.
Edward III understood the power of chivalry like no-one else, and he used it to bind together the knights, the nobles and the Plantagenet crown.
Like his grandfather, Edward I,
Edward was inspired by the legend of King Arthur.
Lavish Arthurian tournaments were held in the Quadrangle at Windsor Castle.
With staged displays of horsemanship and fighting skills.
Windsor castle became the Plantagenet Camelot.
Along with Arthur,
Edward chose a Christian hero to represent his ambition -
Saint George.
Saint George was a warrior saint and he was the patron of knights throughout Christendom.
But Edwards's troops were already marching with the red cross of Saint George at their head, and it flew also from the masts of his ships.
It was becoming a symbol of England and the English King.
And Saint George would be the war cry of the English armies in Edwards's next great conflict.
He was determined to win back the old Plantagenet dynastic lands in France.
The French royal family had seen son succeed father for 320 years.
But in 1328, Charles IV of France died without a son to succeed him.
Edward III was the dead king's nephew.
He believed he had as strong a claim to the French throne as anyone.
Could Edward III of England become Edward I of France?
It wasn't so far-fetched.
Ever since King John had lost their old lands in France over a century before, the Plantagenet kings had nursed the ambition of recovering them.
To acquire the whole of France would be an even greater glory.
Edward saw an opportunity to succeed where his Plantagenet forefathers had failed.
In 1340, he announced his claim to the French throne.
This began an era of slaughter and bloodshed that went on for generations.
In July 1346, an army of around 10,000 men, led by Edward III, landed in Normandy.
Edward may have claimed to be King of France, but this was clearly an English invasion.
The battle was no longer just one between dynasties, it was now a battle between nations.
The English rampaged unopposed through Normandy.
Finally the two great armies confronted each other by the forest of Crecy in the Somme.
The English were drawn up on this ridge.
The French advanced from that direction.
As the battle began, a great storm broke.
Huge flocks of crows flew into the air above the armies.
Then the English archers stepped forward.
Their longbows had a range of 200 metres and a rate of fire three times that of the crossbow.
The crossbowmen on the French side were routed.
And Edward had another shock in store for the French, a primitive but spectacular new weapon in his armoury.
For the first time on a European battlefield, the English used gunpowder to fire cannonballs at the French forces.
The French knights now faced volleys of thousands of arrows amidst the crash of cannon.
They had never seen anything like it.
The King's 16-year-old son, Edward Prince of Wales, later known as the Black Prince fought his way to the heart of the battle.
The chronicler Froissart reports that a man was sent back from the Black Prince's division to the King to ask for help.
Edward III asked him if his son were dead or wounded, and when he heard that he was not, replied, "Send no more to me today,
"let him earn his spurs."
Most of the French knights fought to the death, they preferred the glory of being killed in action to the shame of fleeing the battlefield.
Fighting on the French side was John, the blind King of Bohemia.
Despite his blindness, he wanted to strike at least one blow in the battle.
His knights tied the reins of their horses to the reins of his to guide him into the thick of the fighting.
The Black Prince saw him ride to his death.
In order to honour the King's reckless bravery, the Black Prince adopted as his own badge, the King's emblem.
That emblem was the ostrich feather, which has been the badge of the Princes of Wales ever since.
Around 2,000 French knights died at Crecy.
A whole generation of French noblemen.
In contrast, it's said that as few as 40 English men at arms lost their lives.
The battle for the French crown would continue, but fighting beneath the flag of Saint George, the English army was now the most feared in Europe.
At the end of the battle, King Edward embraced the Black Prince,
"My son," he said, "you have acquitted yourself nobly.
"You are worthy to rule a kingdom."
The Black Prince returned to Windsor an English national hero.
But he would never become King.
Like many a Plantagenet warrior, he was later cut down by dysentery.
But Crecy marked a high point of the Plantagenet dynasty, and its legacy remains.
After their triumphant victory at Crecy, the king and the Black Prince founded the Order of the Garter.
Its origins were in a great tournament at Windsor.
Two teams of 12 knights took part, one headed by the King, and one by the Prince.
The Order was to meet here, in its own chapel, every year on Saint George's Day, the 23rd of April.
The structure of the Order has remained the same to the present day - the monarch, the Prince of Wales and 24 knights.
One set of stalls is designated the King's, the facing set, the Prince's.
Many of the original founding members of the Order of the Garter were companions of arms who had fought together at Crecy.
Now every noble in the land wanted to be bound to the King in this most exclusive of clubs.
The Order of the Garter wasn't just another show of pageantry, it was also a shrewd Plantagenet tool.
For 200 years, Plantagenet dynastic ambition had often clashed with the interests of the English barons.
Now Edward III had brought the noblemen of England behind him in his campaign to win the throne of France.
He had harnessed England's growing sense of nationhood to his own Plantagenet dynastic vision, to create an extraordinary fighting force.
By 1360, the English army had regained large swathes of the Plantagenet lands in France.
Now, to dynastic ambition, emerged the foundations of an English empire.
In 1362, Edward celebrated his 50th birthday.
He marked the occasion by introducing one of the Plantagenets' most significant reforms.
It was known as the Statute of Pleading, and it formally changed the language spoken in the law courts from French to English.
In the same year, parliament was opened for the first time, with a speech made not in French, but in English.
When Henry II, the first Plantagenet King, took the throne in 1154, he spoke scarcely a word of English.
Two centuries later, a dynasty that had regarded England as a possession rather than a nation, now saw England as its home and English as its language.
English was no longer spoken just by the peasants who worked the land.
The knights spoke it, the nobles spoke it, even the King spoke it.
England and the Plantagenets were united as never before.
In the next programme, the death of kings, royal bloodletting divides the dynasty into the warring houses of Lancaster and York.
Henry V fulfils the Plantagenets' greatest ambition at Agincourt, and Richard III makes the Plantagenets' last stand.
Caversham Manor in Berkshire.
The year is 1219.
William Marshall is the most powerful knight in the land and Regent of England.
The 11-year-old boy at his bedside is the fourth Plantagenet king to rule England -
Henry III.
The Plantagenets were a French Dynasty, who ruled England and much of France for 50 years.
But Henry's father, King John, had lost most of their lands in France.
And when Henry came to the throne at the age of nine, half of England was under French occupation.
William Marshall had sworn to protect the young king.
"Even if the whole world abandons the boy," he said,
"I will not fail him."
William Marshall kept his word.
He defeated the French, fought off the rebellious English barons, and ensured that the young Plantagenet would hold on to his crown.
But now, William Marshall was dying and the fate of the Plantagenets rested on the shoulders of a child.
Many predicted disaster.
Instead, something remarkable happened.
The Plantagenet dynasty not only survived, it grew stronger.
Under their rule, over the next 150 years, medieval England reached its peak.
Parliament was born and a clear sense of national identity emerged.
Their roots were in France, French was their language, but the Plantagenet family helped foster a new sense of English nationhood.
Out of their dynastic ambitions would grow an English empire.
For the first 50 years of Plantagenet rule, the English Channel acted as a bridge, connecting the king and his barons to the lands they owned in France.
But, by the reign of Henry III, most of their ancestral homelands in France had been lost.
The English barons were forced to make a commitment to one side of the Channel or the other.
The kings of England and France presented the barons with a stark choice - give up their lands in England and do homage to the King of France or give up their lands in France and swear allegiance to the King of England.
The Channel was no longer a bridge, but a barrier between competing powers.
Possession of French lands always drove the Plantagenet dynasty but, for now, they turned their energies to the country they still ruled - to England.
Henry III was not by nature a warrior.
The Boy King grew up to be a pious ruler, devoted to pilgrimage and prayer.
In 1245, he began rebuilding Westminster Abbey, a project that would occupy him for the rest of his life.
The old Romanesque Basilica was replaced with an immense gothic structure.
This was an architecture of light and sophistication.
The style was French but it was dedicated to the memory of an English king.
The majesty of Westminster Abbey today is the result of Henry III's devotion to Edward the Confessor and his desire to glorify him.
Henry saw Westminster as the centre of the Plantagenet kingdom, and in the heart of the abbey itself, he constructed an elaborate new shrine to the saintly Anglo-Saxon king.
Edward the Confessor is the only English king to have been canonised.
Henry was aligning himself with both God and England.
Edward's golden coffin sat on base of Purbeck marble.
These niches were carved for pilgrims to kneel in prayer.
But the Abbey also served a worldly purpose.
Henry's piety hadn't extinguished his dynastic ambition.
He wanted Westminster Abbey to rival the great churches of the French Kings.
His vision of the Abbey was as the place of coronation and burial for all future Plantagenet kings.
Westminster Abbey would be forever associated with Henry, as his crowning achievement.
But Plantagenet ambition came at a price.
Its rebuilding cost more than twice Henry's annual royal income.
And he had other expensive plans.
Like all his predecessors, Henry was determined to expand his Plantagenet empire, whatever the cost.
Henry wasn't a warrior king, but he could use the revenues of England to add to the Plantagenet dominions.
The Pope was inviting Henry to purchase the rights to the Kingdom of Sicily, and he couldn't refuse the chance to add to the family's lands.
He accepted on behalf of his younger son, Edmund.
The only snag was the price tag.
We know what happened next, because of a contemporary account of Henry's reign.
Kept at Corpus Christi College Cambridge is a manuscript written and illustrated by a St Albans monk, Matthew Paris.
It's called the Chronica Majora, The Great Chronicle.
He tells us Henry agreed to pay the Pope three times his annual income, for the chance to secure Sicily as a Plantagenet land.
It was a huge sum of money, and a great risk.
If Henry defaulted on payment, he faced excommunication from the Church.
For a pious man like Henry, excommunication would be unbearable, but still he pursued the policy.
Even his own brother thought he'd gone mad.
He compared the Pope's offer to a man saying,
"I sell you the moon, now climb up and take it."
It was an ambitious plan to expand Plantagenet power, but it placed royal family interests against those of the barons, and it backfired badly.
The barons were the land-owning nobility of England.
They provided the King with armies to fight his wars.
And he needed their agreement to raise taxes to fund his ambitions.
Yet Henry was alienating his barons by pursuing Sicily.
And they held another grievance against the King.
Henry had filled his court with foreign-born relatives from Savoy and Poitou.
The barons bitterly resented them.
French remained the language of court, but there was a growing suspicion of all things foreign.
Plantagenet dynastic ambitions were still international, but they increasingly came up against a new force - national feeling.
You can see it in the works of Matthew Paris.
Here he shows a French invasion fleet being defeated by English forces.
While the bishops bless those who are fighting, as it says,
"for the liberation of England".
And here he praises a patriotic baron, who would struggle to preserve Anglia Anglis.
England for the English.
National feeling was a growing force Henry couldn't ignore.
He'd taken a huge risk in mortgaging his kingdom to expand a Plantagenet empire in the Mediterranean.
But now, he was bankrupt and the English barons were on the point of rebellion.
Things came to a head one April morning in 1258.
Seven barons in full armour confronted Henry, here in Westminster Hall.
The King was startled, "What is this, my Lords, am I your captive?"
They reassured him that they were not rebels, but friends of the Crown, but they insisted that the King dismiss his foreign relatives and take back their castle and lands.
The King's relatives protested noisily, but the barons warned them, "Know for a fact
"that you will either return the castles or lose your head."
Henry had little choice but to agree.
The King's submission to the barons triggered a chain of reforming legislation that would transform the way England was governed.
The reforms would be agreed by a committee of 24, 12 chosen by the King and 12 by the barons.
For the first time in English history, power would be shared by the King with a 15-member council.
These historic reforms are known as the Provisions of Oxford.
Medieval kings had always claimed to rule by the grace of God, but Henry now reluctantly swore an oath to share power with the barons, in the name of le Commune d'Angleterre, the Community of England.
Provoked by Plantagenet extravagance, the Provisions of Oxford mark an important moment in the history of England, and of the limitation of royal power.
For 20 years, the assemblies where the King consulted with his bishops and barons had been known by a term derived from the French, "parler", to talk.
This gave us the name of a new institution, Parliament.
Henry appealed to the Pope to extricate himself from the Provisions of Oxford.
But his own brother-in-law, Simon De Montford, condemned Henry as a king who had lost touch with his people.
De Montfort saw himself as England's saviour.
The King knew he was in danger.
He told De Montfort,
"I fear thunder and lightning beyond measure, but by God's head.
"I dread you more than all the thunder and lightning in the world."
He was right to be afraid.
From his base here in Kenilworth Castle,
De Montfort raised an army against the King.
In 1264, Simon De Montfort confronted royal troops, led by the King and his son Prince Edward, outside Lewes.
De Montfort's men were outnumbered, but they inflicted a humiliating defeat on Henry, and took Prince Edward prisoner.
Henry remained king in name only.
For the next 15 months, England was ruled, not by a Plantagenet, but by Simon De Montfort.
And he did so through Parliament.
De Montfort's Parliament of 1265 is often regarded as the forerunner of the modern Parliament.
As always, it included barons and bishops, who sit nowadays as the House of Lords.
But for the first time, knights and burgesses were sent from the Shires and from the Boroughs, elected to Parliament by the property owners of England.
Parliament now had the beginnings of a second House, later to be known as The Commons.
Henry III seemed to be a spent force, but his son Edward was a warrior, prepared to defend his Plantagenet birthright to the death.
With the help of men loyal to his cause,
Edward escaped his captivity in Hereford.
He raised an army and confronted De Montfort at Evesham.
At the battle of Evesham,
Edward re-asserted Plantagenet rule in England.
De Montfort's supporters were slaughtered and De Montfort himself killed in the battle.
His hands and feet were cut off.
His testicles severed and hung scornfully over his nose.
Then his head was sent to the wife of one of his chief enemies.
De Montfort's rule was over.
But the English Parliament lived on, and future Plantagenet kings would ignore it at their peril.
Henry had had a lucky escape.
He returned to the life of religious devotion and pilgrimage.
He'd gambled with the Plantagenet crown, and his actions had provoked the opening up of Parliament to elected representatives of the English people.
Henry's England had a growing sense of national spirit.
But when he died, Henry revealed his own true allegiance.
Henry's body was laid to rest in Westminster Abbey, to spend eternity alongside his beloved Anglo-Saxon hero,
Edward the Confessor.
But his heart was sent to be buried with his Plantagenet ancestors, at the Abbey of Fontevraud in Anjou.
An English King, but a French heart, a Plantagenet to the last.
Edward, the warrior prince, now became King Edward I of England.
Tall and intimidating, with a mop of curly hair,
Edward was known as Longshanks.
He inherited a country recovering from turmoil.
Edward also inherited the famous Plantagenet temper.
Reputedly he once frightened an unfortunate Archbishop of York, literally to death.
But he'd learned two things from his father's mistakes - to keep the barons happy, and not to run out of money.
And he sought to find ways to attain both those goals.
Like his ancestors, Edward encouraged the planning of new towns to generate wealth and taxes.
Towns like Hull and Winchelsea nurtured a new society based on trade, and trade became the lifeblood of the Plantagenet dynasty.
Medieval England reached its economic peak under Edward I.
But there was a darker side to its growing sense of national identity.
England's Jewish population had arrived from France shortly after the Norman Conquest.
The Pope had decreed that lending money at interest was a sin for Christians, so the Jews became the chief source of credit for the King and his barons.
Jews were often resented, they were frequently persecuted and attacked.
And by the reign of Edward I, in this age of crusades,
England had become an increasingly militant Christian nation.
The King himself was a conventional Christian with no sympathy for the plight of the Jews.
At a time when English national feeling was growing,
Edward's vision of England was a fiercely Christian one - this England had no place for the Jews.
With the support of his barons, Edward decided to expel the entire Jewish population from his realm.
Some 2,000-3,000 Jews departed from the shores of England.
There was to be no resident Jewish population in the country for the next 370 years.
Yet Plantagenet ambitions always extended beyond England.
Edward was inspired by King Arthur, a popular figure in folklore, who was said to have once ruled over a united Britain.
Edward wanted to align the Plantagenet dynasty with this legendary, all-conquering leader.
And he had the conquest of Wales in his sights.
Wales had troubled the Plantagenet kings for generations, its rugged terrain made it hard to conquer and control, and they regarded its inhabitants as little more than barbarians.
But Edward I was a man who never gave up what he saw as his rights.
And these included, in his eyes, overlordship of Wales.
But a rival dynasty stood in the way of Plantagenet ambition.
The Princes of Gwynedd had ruled here for centuries.
Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, and his younger brother Dyfed, were the latest in a long line of warrior leaders who held a crown said to be King Arthur's.
Edward's father Henry, recognised Llywelyn as Prince of Wales, as long as he paid homage to the English crown.
But when Edward took the throne, Llywelyn refused to pay homage.
Edward declared Llywelyn a rebel and a disturber of the peace.
And in 1277 set off westward from Chester at the head of a powerful army of 800 knights, crossbow men from Gascony and 16,000 infantry.
Along the way, they were supplied by a fleet of ships sent up from the royal ports of the south coast, like Winchelsea.
The Welsh were hopelessly outnumbered.
Edward's army captured Anglesey, the bread basket of Wales.
At a stroke, this provided food for his own men and cut off supplies to the Welsh.
Llywelyn had no choice but to surrender and pay homage to Edward.
An uneasy truce followed.
But it was broken, when Dafydd ap Gruffydd led a new rebellion against English rule.
For over a year, the Plantagenet army clashed with Welsh defenders.
But in 1282, disaster struck for the Welsh dynasty.
Llywelyn was killed in battle.
His head cut off and sent to London.
Dafydd ap Gruffydd held out here at Dolbadarn Castle for a few months more.
Finally he was captured and tried by the English.
Condemned to death as the last survivor of a family of traitors, he was hanged and then cut down and disembowelled, his entrails were burned in front of him, his body was quartered and then his head was cut off
and sent to the Tower of London to be displayed alongside that of his brother.
As a final act of ritual humiliation the Welsh surrendered to the English King the crown of King Arthur.
Wales was now a Plantagenet dominion.
Edward had confronted a rival dynasty, and emerged victorious.
Now, to stamp his authority, he began building and repairing a chain of castles across North Wales.
These fortresses represent the peak of medieval castle building.
Edward personally chose the site for each of his castles, and the most impressive of all arose above the River Seiont at Caernarfon.
This twin-towered gatehouse, known as the King's Gate, was built according to the designs of King Edward himself.
The approach to the castle was guarded by arrow slits, and by spy holes.
And once here, you would have been confronted with a drawbridge, six portcullises and five sets of gates.
This was Plantagenet military architecture at its most intimidating.
Edward engaged the most famous castle architect in Europe.
Master James of St George.
King Edward was keen to associate the Plantagenet dynasty with the glories of the Christian Roman empire.
And so he commanded Master James to base his designs on the great walls of Constantinople.
This meant building many-sided towers instead of the more usual round ones.
The walls are up to 20-feet thick, and patterned with bands of coloured stone, a byzantine design not previously seen in the British Isles.
Caernarfon Castle was a bold statement of Plantagenet domination.
For the Welsh it was a painful reminder of conquest and oppression.
Edward was also preparing for the future, and laying a Plantagenet dynastic claim to Wales.
In 1284, the King's 11th child, a son named Edward, was born here.
At the age of 16, Edward of Caernarfon would be declared Prince of Wales, a title stolen from Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, which has been borne by the eldest son of the English sovereign ever since.
It looked at one point as though Scotland would go the way of Wales, swallowed up by the English kingdom.
But a different dynastic problem had arisen there.
When the King of Scotland died in 1286, he left no male heir.
The bloodline of Scottish kings was broken.
The dead king's three-year-old granddaughter,
Margaret of Norway, was next in line for the throne.
Edward came up with a neat Plantagenet solution.
Margaret would return to Scotland to marry his own infant son.
The situation would be resolved by diplomacy in marriage, not by war.
And Britain would be united under the Plantagenets.
It remains one of the great "what ifs" of British history.
No marriage took place, little Margaret died in Orkney on her way to Scotland, and with her, died Edward's plan for a bloodless Plantagenet takeover of Scotland.
After the death of Margaret, Edward agreed to tolerate a subordinate king in Scotland.
But as soon as he showed signs of independence,
Edward reacted with typical Plantagenet brutality.
His troops sacked Berwick and defeated a Scottish army at Dunbar.
English garrisons and officials were installed across Scotland to intimidate and control.
For Edward, the Kingdom of Scotland had ceased to exist.
As he handed the royal seal of Scotland to one of his barons he said, "A man does good business when he rids himself of a turd."
But Scotland did not go the way of Wales.
This wasn't a battle between dynasties, but between two countries with a growing sense of national identity and pride.
No-one displayed this more than one of the Scottish resistance leaders,
William Wallace.
Wallace was a proud and charismatic figure.
He refused to pay homage to Edward.
To crush Wallace, the English army had to cross the River Forth.
On a 13th century map of Britain, by Matthew Paris,
Scotland is shown dramatically divided by the River Forth.
And the only place to cross was the bridge at Stirling.
It was here that William Wallace confronted the English army, to preserve Scotland's freedom.
At this time, the bridge here was just wide enough for the English forces to cross two abreast.
Once half the army had crossed, the Scots swooped down and cut off the bridge.
The English stranded on the Northern bank were surrounded.
The result was slaughter.
Around 5,000 English infantrymen died at Stirling Bridge.
The battle didn't decide the issue, but Wallace's defiance shook Edward.
International dynasties, like the Plantagenets, struggled to understand national feeling.
Edward underestimated the strength of resistance it could produce.
He was riding to confront another Scottish leader, Robert Bruce, when he died in 1307.
Plantagenet determination to subdue Scotland was undiminished.
But Edward II's defeat by Robert Bruce at Bannockburn seven years later, set the limits to Plantagenet ambitions in Britain.
They would never conquer the Scots.
And they provoked a deepening of Scottish national pride, and a sense of independence that survives to this day.
The new Plantagenet king lacked his father's warrior instincts.
Edward II preferred gardening to fighting.
He would fail to build on his father's legacy, and his lapses of judgement would threaten to destroy the Plantagenet dynasty.
Edward's reign began well.
He secured a great prize in the marriage market,
Isabella, daughter of the King of France.
She was just 12 years old, but already considered a beauty of beauties and very wise.
A month after their wedding,
Westminster Abbey was the setting for Edward's coronation.
This was his first opportunity to show off his new Queen.
Instead, Isabella was upstaged.
As Edward and Isabella walked down the aisle, it wasn't the young Queen who caught the eye.
Walking just ahead of them and leading the procession was a young man called Piers Gaveston.
He was dressed in clothes of imperial purple, studded with pearls.
And in his hands he cradled the crown of St Edward the Confessor, the most sacred of the royal regalia.
There was no more privileged position in the royal procession.
Gaveston was being honoured as the most important noble in the land.
At the banquet that followed,
Edward and Gaveston shocked the guests with their display of affection for each other.
Isabella's uncles walked out in disgust.
Every medieval king had court favourites, but none had ever achieved the power and influence Piers Gaveston exercised over Edward II.
The King claimed he loved him like a brother.
But the St Paul's chronicler noted that the King frequented.
Piers's couch more than the Queen's.
We can never know for sure if there was a sexual relationship between Edward II and Piers Gaveston, but we do know that there are no mentions of homosexuality during their lifetimes, and they had plenty of enemies who would have brought it up.
The earliest references come after Edward's downfall, and from men who were deeply hostile to him.
What can't be doubted is that Edward was infatuated with Gaveston, to a degree that compromised his Kingship, and provoked the baron's hatred.
But Gaveston displayed no fear of the barons.
Famed for his quick and sarcastic tongue,
Gaveston gave the barons nicknames.
The Earl of Lancaster was The Fiddler.
The Earl of Lincoln, Burstbelly,
And the Earl of Warwick, whose seat was here at Warwick Castle, was the Black Dog of Arden.
But this was a dangerous game.
The Black Dog could bite.
Once again, the Plantagenet rule was under threat because of foreign-born court favourites.
Once again, the barons felt compelled to act.
Gaveston was captured and put in the custody of the Earl of Pembroke who guaranteed his safety.
But in his absence, the Black Dog pounced.
The Earl of Warwick seized Gaveston.
After a token trial, he was led out on the road to Kenilworth.
When they reached Blacklow Hill, here on the land of the Earl of Lancaster,
Gaveston was first stabbed and then beheaded.
His body was left on the hillside until claimed by two Dominican friars.
"And that was the end of Piers," commented a contemporary chronicler,
"who had risen on high, but now fell into nothingness."
If Edward had now concentrated his energies on being king, his infatuation with Gaveston might have been quickly forgotten.
Instead, to Isabella's horror, he began to shower favours on another young noble -
Hugh Dispenser.
Dispenser and Edward became inseparable.
Angry barons said he bewitched the King's mind.
But Dispenser made an enemy yet more dangerous than the barons -
Edward's Queen, Isabella.
Isabella came to despise Dispenser, in the words of a contemporary chronicle, "with a more than perfect hatred".
But Edward still needed Isabella.
In 1324, the French invaded Gascony, the last of the Plantagenet lands in France.
Isabella's brother was now the King of France, so Edward asked his wife to travel to Paris to sue for peace.
Isabella's brother welcomed her warmly, and promised to restore Gascony on condition that Edward did homage for the Duchy.
With his barons threatening rebellion at home,
Edward was reluctant to leave England, but he sent his son in his place.
And so here, at the Chateau de Vincennes outside Paris, in the company of his mother, the young Edward knelt at the feet of Charles IV of France.
But then, instead of returning to England, he remained in France with his mother.
When Edward requested their return, Isabella refused.
She finally revealed her feelings about her husband's relationship with Hugh Dispenser.
"I feel that marriage is a joining together of man and woman,
"and someone has come between my husband and me,
"trying to break this bond."
Edwards's letters to his son became increasingly violent.
"We will take such measures that you will feel it
"all the days of your life, and all other sons will learn what it means
"to disobey their lords and fathers."
A Plantagenet family crisis was about to turn into a political disaster.
News reached the king that the rebel baron Roger Mortimer was now Isabella's lover.
According to the Bishop of Hereford, Edward determined to strike back with true Plantagenet vindictiveness.
If he had no other weapon, he would crush her with his teeth.
Isabella and Mortimer landed on the Suffolk coast, and quickly found support from disaffected barons.
Edward's cause was lost.
Hugh Dispenser paid the price for his closeness to the king.
He was tied to a ladder and his genitals sliced off.
His entrails were removed, and along with his heart, thrown into a fire.
The King was taken prisoner.
According to the English chronicler Geoffrey Le Baker, the imprisoned king was told that if he refused to abdicate in favour of his son, someone other than a Plantagenet would take the throne.
Weeping and barely able to stand,
Edward eventually agreed to sacrifice himself for his dynasty.
He stood down in favour of his son, the first abdication of a King of England.
But the Plantagenet bloodline had been protected.
On the 1st of February, 1327, his son, Prince Edward, was crowned.
He was 14 years old.
His mother, Isabella, was appointed regent.
She and Mortimer now ruled England on Edward's behalf.
But a deposed former king was a new dynastic problem.
Edward was brought here, to Berkeley Castle, and these are original documents from the castle at that time.
Here we read about the delivery of chickens to the kitchen of the King's father, which is what Edward now was.
And here is a record of his daily expenses -
£5 a day, quite a generous amount.
And here is a report of a messenger being sent to Nottingham to inform Isabella concerning "morte patris regis".
The death of the king's father.
The death of Edward II solved Isabella and Mortimer's problems.
But there were already questions about how Edward died.
And killing a king was an offence against God and the natural order.
The most plausible cause of death to be suggested was suffocation, but other, more lurid accounts soon circulated.
Within 30 years, Geoffrey Le Baker and other chroniclers were writing that Edward had had a red-hot poker inserted into his anus.
It's no surprise which version has caught the public imagination.
No-one knows for sure, but with either the red-hot poker or suffocation, no mark would be visible, when the king's body was displayed to show that he was truly dead.
To all appearances, Edward II died of natural causes.
The fate of the Plantagenet dynasty now lay in the hands of Isabella and Roger Mortimer.
But three years later, tired of the corrupt rule of his mother and her lover, the young King Edward decided to take action.
One night in October 1330, two dozen supporters of the young King crept through a secret tunnel.
Above, in Nottingham castle, slept Isabella and Roger Mortimer.
The leader of the conspirators warned the young King,
"It is better to eat the dog than to be eaten by the dog."
But Mortimer hadn't got to rule England without a killer's instincts.
The King's supporters knew that if their plans failed, they would be hanged as traitors.
The young conspirators entered the castle and made for the queen's bedchamber.
As they drew their swords and entered,
Edward stood quietly outside the room.
Suspecting her son's presence, Isabella called out,
"Good son, good son, have mercy on noble Mortimer."
But there was to be no mercy,
Mortimer was taken to the Tower of London, and within a few weeks he was hanged like an ordinary criminal.
And out of the shadow of his mother and her lover stepped the new Plantagenet King.
Edward III.
In the uncertain world of medieval politics people looked to omens and portents for guidance.
One place they found it was in ancient prophesies about the fates and fortunes of kings.
The prophecy of the Six Kings drew on the legend of King Arthur.
In it, Merlin characterised the future Plantagenet Kings as animals.
Henry III was a pious lamb, Edward I a battling dragon,
Edward II was a lascivious goat, but his son, who would grow up to be Edward III, was a glorious wild boar with the heart of a lion, who would conquer more than any of his blood in this world.
The message was clear -
England once again had a Plantagenet king to rally behind.
Edward III would not make the mistakes of his father.
He set out to unify the English barons around him, and at his birthplace, Windsor Castle, he spent a royal fortune, transforming it into the heart of his kingdom.
He turned it from a castle into a palace.
It became the most expensive single building project by any Plantagenet king, and the perfect setting for royal displays of chivalry.
Under Edward III, the rituals of chivalry became central to the Plantagenet court.
Chivalry was a code of behaviour that proudly fused military and Christian ethics.
The word refers to the customs and values of the Chevaliers, the French term for those who rode into battle, the knights.
And it demanded that these knights be brave, loyal and devoted to their ladies.
Edward III understood the power of chivalry like no-one else, and he used it to bind together the knights, the nobles and the Plantagenet crown.
Like his grandfather, Edward I,
Edward was inspired by the legend of King Arthur.
Lavish Arthurian tournaments were held in the Quadrangle at Windsor Castle.
With staged displays of horsemanship and fighting skills.
Windsor castle became the Plantagenet Camelot.
Along with Arthur,
Edward chose a Christian hero to represent his ambition -
Saint George.
Saint George was a warrior saint and he was the patron of knights throughout Christendom.
But Edwards's troops were already marching with the red cross of Saint George at their head, and it flew also from the masts of his ships.
It was becoming a symbol of England and the English King.
And Saint George would be the war cry of the English armies in Edwards's next great conflict.
He was determined to win back the old Plantagenet dynastic lands in France.
The French royal family had seen son succeed father for 320 years.
But in 1328, Charles IV of France died without a son to succeed him.
Edward III was the dead king's nephew.
He believed he had as strong a claim to the French throne as anyone.
Could Edward III of England become Edward I of France?
It wasn't so far-fetched.
Ever since King John had lost their old lands in France over a century before, the Plantagenet kings had nursed the ambition of recovering them.
To acquire the whole of France would be an even greater glory.
Edward saw an opportunity to succeed where his Plantagenet forefathers had failed.
In 1340, he announced his claim to the French throne.
This began an era of slaughter and bloodshed that went on for generations.
In July 1346, an army of around 10,000 men, led by Edward III, landed in Normandy.
Edward may have claimed to be King of France, but this was clearly an English invasion.
The battle was no longer just one between dynasties, it was now a battle between nations.
The English rampaged unopposed through Normandy.
Finally the two great armies confronted each other by the forest of Crecy in the Somme.
The English were drawn up on this ridge.
The French advanced from that direction.
As the battle began, a great storm broke.
Huge flocks of crows flew into the air above the armies.
Then the English archers stepped forward.
Their longbows had a range of 200 metres and a rate of fire three times that of the crossbow.
The crossbowmen on the French side were routed.
And Edward had another shock in store for the French, a primitive but spectacular new weapon in his armoury.
For the first time on a European battlefield, the English used gunpowder to fire cannonballs at the French forces.
The French knights now faced volleys of thousands of arrows amidst the crash of cannon.
They had never seen anything like it.
The King's 16-year-old son, Edward Prince of Wales, later known as the Black Prince fought his way to the heart of the battle.
The chronicler Froissart reports that a man was sent back from the Black Prince's division to the King to ask for help.
Edward III asked him if his son were dead or wounded, and when he heard that he was not, replied, "Send no more to me today,
"let him earn his spurs."
Most of the French knights fought to the death, they preferred the glory of being killed in action to the shame of fleeing the battlefield.
Fighting on the French side was John, the blind King of Bohemia.
Despite his blindness, he wanted to strike at least one blow in the battle.
His knights tied the reins of their horses to the reins of his to guide him into the thick of the fighting.
The Black Prince saw him ride to his death.
In order to honour the King's reckless bravery, the Black Prince adopted as his own badge, the King's emblem.
That emblem was the ostrich feather, which has been the badge of the Princes of Wales ever since.
Around 2,000 French knights died at Crecy.
A whole generation of French noblemen.
In contrast, it's said that as few as 40 English men at arms lost their lives.
The battle for the French crown would continue, but fighting beneath the flag of Saint George, the English army was now the most feared in Europe.
At the end of the battle, King Edward embraced the Black Prince,
"My son," he said, "you have acquitted yourself nobly.
"You are worthy to rule a kingdom."
The Black Prince returned to Windsor an English national hero.
But he would never become King.
Like many a Plantagenet warrior, he was later cut down by dysentery.
But Crecy marked a high point of the Plantagenet dynasty, and its legacy remains.
After their triumphant victory at Crecy, the king and the Black Prince founded the Order of the Garter.
Its origins were in a great tournament at Windsor.
Two teams of 12 knights took part, one headed by the King, and one by the Prince.
The Order was to meet here, in its own chapel, every year on Saint George's Day, the 23rd of April.
The structure of the Order has remained the same to the present day - the monarch, the Prince of Wales and 24 knights.
One set of stalls is designated the King's, the facing set, the Prince's.
Many of the original founding members of the Order of the Garter were companions of arms who had fought together at Crecy.
Now every noble in the land wanted to be bound to the King in this most exclusive of clubs.
The Order of the Garter wasn't just another show of pageantry, it was also a shrewd Plantagenet tool.
For 200 years, Plantagenet dynastic ambition had often clashed with the interests of the English barons.
Now Edward III had brought the noblemen of England behind him in his campaign to win the throne of France.
He had harnessed England's growing sense of nationhood to his own Plantagenet dynastic vision, to create an extraordinary fighting force.
By 1360, the English army had regained large swathes of the Plantagenet lands in France.
Now, to dynastic ambition, emerged the foundations of an English empire.
In 1362, Edward celebrated his 50th birthday.
He marked the occasion by introducing one of the Plantagenets' most significant reforms.
It was known as the Statute of Pleading, and it formally changed the language spoken in the law courts from French to English.
In the same year, parliament was opened for the first time, with a speech made not in French, but in English.
When Henry II, the first Plantagenet King, took the throne in 1154, he spoke scarcely a word of English.
Two centuries later, a dynasty that had regarded England as a possession rather than a nation, now saw England as its home and English as its language.
English was no longer spoken just by the peasants who worked the land.
The knights spoke it, the nobles spoke it, even the King spoke it.
England and the Plantagenets were united as never before.
In the next programme, the death of kings, royal bloodletting divides the dynasty into the warring houses of Lancaster and York.
Henry V fulfils the Plantagenets' greatest ambition at Agincourt, and Richard III makes the Plantagenets' last stand.
(playing lively jazz music)
(whoops)
Hey, Lieutenant, you okay?
Take a load off, man!
Relax!
I'm, uh...
I'm fine.
Yeah!
(whoops)
Hey.
How you doin' tonight?
You look like you could use something cold.
Yeah.
Just... some water, please.
That's all.
Thank you.
Darlin', why don't you go get some air, okay?
Relax a little.
Hey.
Navy.
Navy, you all right?
My God!
(grunts) Whoa, easy.
(panting)
(yells)
(tires screeching)

New Orleans 1x02 ♪ Carrier Original Air Date on September 30, 2014
You concentrate any harder, you're gonna strain a muscle.
I am learning about New Orleans.
Coming from the Great Lakes,
I want to soak up all the history and culture that I can.
It'll make me a better agent.
Well, you don't need a book to do that.
I'm new to the Gulf.
I need all the help I can get.
Tell me one thing you know that I can't read about.
Chicken Fried Raymond.
Who?
Chicken Fried Cornelius Raymond.
Street musician.
Corner of Dauphine and Conti.
Been standing' there for years.
Got kicked in the mouth by a buggy horse.
Tooth flew into the newly repaved concrete.
Still there now, crown and all.
That's disgusting.
You can't find that in a history book.
Got another one.
Streetcar 952 that ran on the Desire line started right here.
A little slice of Americana.
(phone rings) In all the nooks and crannies.
Pride here.
When?
Call the morgue.
Tell 'em we'll be right there.
What we got?
USS Geronimo's in port, and the crew's on liberty.
One of her officers got hit by a taxi early this morning in the French Quarter.
Are you going to speak to his XO?
Next on my to-do list.
Grab your things.
Did you know in 1923 there was a train accident?
This horse-drawn delivery truck was crossing the rails when out of nowhere...
Are you gonna do this all day?
Do what?
(exhales)
(camera shutter clicking)
My mother always said, "Look both ways before crossing."
Now I realize she meant physically and metaphorically.
Why did the chicken cross the road, Loretta?
In this instance,
"to get to the other side" is clearly a misnomer.
LASALLE:
A simple case of man versus car.
Bartender says Navy Lieutenant Lewis Collier was behaving erratically, having trouble focusing.
Seem like he was on something?
Drugged?
I won't know till I do a full blood panel back at the morgue.
Something had him jacked-up.
Had to be something in his system.
Either he took it...
Or was forced to.
WADE:
Blood alcohol levels indicate he wasn't inebriated.
Petechial hemorrhaging could have been from impact but... the whites of his eyes, yellow and jaundiced like he overdosed.
The lieutenant is a plethora of contradictions.
Let me rephrase the question.
Why did the sailor cross the road?
Let me rephrase the answer.
The sailor crossed against his will.
Something made him do it.
Now he's dead.
(sighs) Anything?
Collier's XO, Commander Bates, is currently back on board the Geronimo.
We're meeting in an hour.
Details from Loretta?
She and Sebastian have started the autopsy.
Anything on the lieutenant?
(phone rings) LASALLE:
Lieutenant Lewis Collier, 32 years old.
Born and raised in Chatham, Virginia.
Straight "A"s in college.
No flags on the play.
Engaged to be married.
Navy record?
Spotless.
Not even a rental car parking ticket.
Somebody could've had their eye on Collier the minute he stepped ashore.
Could've followed him, drugged him at dinner.
It's happened before.
It fits the M.O.
Wait for the drugs to kick in, follow him back to port, mug him along the way.
He just... never got that far.
It'll show up in the labs.
Maybe.
Pride, Collier's fiancée just flew in.
Let's see what she can tell us.
WOMAN:
You didn't know Lewis.
He was... so sweet, so gentle.
You're right.
I-I didn't know the lieutenant.
But I know his shipmates were having a good time last night.
A-And I know he might've taken something accidentally.
Or someone gave him something.
Lewis liked to have fun, but he was super careful.
He worked out, watched his diet, took great care of himself.
Navy records don't disagree.
He was the most responsible man that I've ever known.
And yet something happened.
When he was in that bar, everything changed.
Lewis cared about us.
He wanted a family.
He wouldn't do anything stupid to risk that.
Something made him run in front of that car.
Autopsy's happening as we speak.
I loved him.
(sobs)
I'm truly sorry for your loss.
Agent Pride, my fiancé's dead.
Please find out why.
Talk to me, Loretta.
Steinbeck.
Pardon?
Gone are the days when people died of... working too hard in the fields, and old age was a legitimate medical diagnosis.
I bring up Mr. Steinbeck because those were simpler times.
Now it's all about peeling back the layers.
Cases like this are mysteries wrapped in... complex enigmas.
I take it you're curious about this one.
So far all I can determine of the lieutenant is that he had some kind of upper respiratory infection.
Labs back?
Yeah.
A basic analysis.
Nothing out of the ordinary.
White cells, slightly elevated.
Antihistamines were found in his system.
Decongestants.
He must have been feeling flu-ish.
As I said before, no alcohol and no hallucinogenics.
What about a chemical imbalance or TIA?
Something to account for the behavior.
A stroke's doubtful but worth checking.
Pride, Hmm?
you know, there's a snowball truck in the parking lot.
Is that you being polite?
You want me to go?
I appreciate...
You know I appreciate the... guesswork, but you need to let us do our jobs.
Why are you so antsy about him anyway?
He was a good man, good officer.
No signs of bad behavior.
I got a feelin' there's more to it.
As do I.
Mango or chocolate?
(chuckles):
Neither.
Until the lieutenant provides me with some much-needed answers,
I prefer to remain sugar-free.
Go.
(ship horn blows)
I think the immigration monument is not far from here.
It's just down the road from here.
I used to patrol this area when I was a deputy.
You know, the late 1800s was a very interesting time in local history.
Yesterday I was reading about the Italian community in New Orleans...
You're really gettin' into this.
There's just so much.
I'm like a sponge.
I want to soak up everything I can.
Don't believe everything you read, Brody.
History's fun, but it's not always accurate.
I want to hear about your days in the sheriff's department.
Nothing much to hear.
Alabama boy moves to New Orleans and does some good.
You're being modest.
Got to be more to it than that.
Some things are better in small bites.
I guess I'm one of 'em.
Commander Bates.
Agent Lasalle, Agent Brody, NCIS.
You're here about Collier.
He was a gifted officer and a good man.
It's a terrible loss.
This is Dr. Mitchell Hufcutt, one of our medical consultants.
He was just offering some grief counseling to my crew.
Glad I was here and available to help.
How are they doing, Doctor?
Wounds take time to heal, whether they're accidental or during times of conflict.
Posttraumatic symptoms will surface eventually.
All we can do is address them one day at a time.
If there's anything more I can do for you, Commander, don't hesitate to ask.
People say Collier was behaving erratically last night, like he was on something.
Does that surprise you?
Very much.
Collier was a pro.
All business.
Does he have any enemies?
None, as far as I know.
But we work under a lot of pressure.
Issues come up on occasion.
What are you getting at?
Wondering if the lieutenant was targeted.
By whom?
We're all mourning this loss together.
You know, I've been in the Navy 15 years, and I've never lost a sailor until now.
You always know it's a possibility in war time, but not during a port visit.
And not like this.
Sebastian?
Oh, nice to see you, Agent Pride.
Everything all right?
Well, yes and no.
Mind telling me about the "no"?
(sighs)
For thousands of years, Agent Pride, people have been reaping the benefits of yoga.
Scholars have traced its roots back to Stone Age shamanism.
It increases blood flow to the brain.
Helps me and others focus in times of trouble.
You troubled about something?
There are certain things that I've come to count on in life.
The Rebirth at the Maple Leaf every Tuesday, the fact that I can do a speed run of Super Mario Bros. 2 in eight and a half minutes, and my trusty Mass Spectrometer, though, not necessarily in that order.
What are you getting at, Sebastian?
Well, I had prepped a sample of Lieutenant Collier's stomach contents for analysis, but I'm getting readings that don't make any sense.
A bacteria that I didn't expect to encounter.
What kind of bacteria?
Oh, I'm not talking about a good kind of bacteria, like in live yogurt cultures, or that Jamie Lee Curtis stuff, but like a real nasty-looking bacteria.
The kind that destroys small cities in Japanese monster movies.
So, anyway, I thought I'd take a moment, center myself, do dolphin pose.
Did it help?
Not especially, no.
But it did give me time to focus and prepare to explore the accuracy of my data.
Something's-something's definitely miscalculated.
How far along is Loretta?
Concluding her autopsy.
She should be handing me all kinds of pertinent information in a matter of... (alarm sounding) Uh-oh.
Dr. Wade.
Stop right there!
Go back!
Both of you, get back!
You need a mask in here.
Loretta, what is it?
Are you all right?
Go on, get back!
Both of you!
Wh... hold on.
I've detected septicemia and bacteria in the decedent's lungs.
The sinuses are full of bloody mucus, the bleeding is into the dermis and the internal organs.
Can you make a hypothesis, Mr. Lund?
Well, I mean, it-it could be any number of things really.
Although, the bacteria that you're mentioning explains my Mass Spec concern.
And?
But without definitive sampling I could...
Oh, my.
I got to get my orange vest!
I'm very focused right now.
I know the protocol.
Loretta, what the hell is this?
This man isn't drugged.
He has bubonic plague!
VANCE:
Before I continue, were you all checked?
Head to toe.
Vaccinated, too.
This is the first confirmed case of bubonic plague in a U.S. metropolitan city in decades.
Course of action is Yumen, China.
Happened in Yumen last July.
Man died of the plague, and they closed down the whole city.
Quarantines, roadblocks, you name it.
Swift action prevented an outbreak.
Of course, we're not there yet, but we need to follow it.
We need to track Collier's path through the city.
Figure out all the people he came in contact with, where he ate, even which bathrooms he used.
Hospitals are on alert.
BOLO's out on anyone showing symptoms.
New Orleans knows how to take on a crisis.
It should.
You've been to hell and back.
And yet, we're still here, Director.
Can't get rid of us that easy.
All right, we're following standard, bio-attack emergency protocol.
Where are we with the Geronimo's
Ship is on lockdown, and we're rounding up sailors from liberty.
Round faster.
Enlist the help of local law enforcement.
If the contagion happened on board, they're all carriers.
I'm on it.
PRIDE:
We're gonna need help from the CDC.
Details on symptoms and treatments.
Incubation is two to six days.
Since the crew just started liberty, that means it had to originate on board at sea.
Doc Wade said flu medication was in Collier's blood work.
He was sick, just didn't know how bad.
Mayor, governor, who else knows?
The goal is to keep this orderly, calm and focused.
Sir, it says here that the bubonic plague, going back to the late Middle Ages, was primarily spread by fleas associated with mice and rats.
Water rat could have been on board the whole time.
Or snuck on with food or supplies.
Pride, it's clear we need to contain this situation fast.
If word gets out, a citywide panic would be just as deadly as the plague itself.
(quietly):
Yeah.
PRIDE:
That'd be 34 unaccounted for, right?
(Wade speaks indistinctly) I got them, I got them.
All right, can I have everybody's attention, please?
We have the full support of the Navy, the Pentagon, and the national health organizations.
Now, as of roll call half an hour ago, there are 34 sailors from the Geronimo still at liberty in the city of New Orleans.
They're all being contacted.
NCIS, in conjunction with local law enforcement, is looking to pick up each and every one of them.
And I can assure you that we won't stop until every crew member is safely returned to the ship and tested.
Doc Wade.
Have there been any reports at local hospitals of civilian patients exhibiting symptoms?
None.
We're in constant communication with the emergency rooms, and there's nothing yet.
HUFCUTT:
We've gathered as much antibiotic and live-attenuated EV76 vaccine as we can.
Bubonic isn't something we had stockpiled.
No one saw this coming.
All we can do is hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
Copies of my autopsy on Lieutenant Collier are being distributed.
As laboratory specifics are determined, you'll be the first to know.
Based on your initial examinations, Dr. Wade, how physically destructive is this bubonic strain?
It's the worst I've ever seen.
(indistinct chatter)
Six crew members from the Geronimo were found in the Garden District.
No visible sign of illness.
That's good news.
Sheriff offering air support?
Mounted officers in the Quarter, air and patrol units everywhere else.
Why is finding sailors like herding cats?
I got to say-- murderers, drug dealers, terrorists-- I can take 'em all down.
But chasing a germ scares the hell out of me.
We'll do it together.
Let's get out there and stop this.
We're gonna stop it before it stops New Orleans.
That was Pride.
They just picked up five more from the Geronimo.
Fishing trip on a charter in the gulf.
All of 'em was together.
Any symptoms?
Nothing yet.
Docs are checking.
Local sheriff and NOPD units divided the city into different search quadrants.
Hospitals got phone banks going.
Reaching out to locals, asking if they've seen anything.
We put tracking software on every sailor's cell phone.
Brody, you've been a big help.
Pride and I want you to know we kind of like having you around.
There's been way too much testosterone in this office for too long.
Oh.
You two know I needed a change.
I guess I got lucky.
(beeping) Cell tracker.
Got a bead on one of the missing crewmen.
It's trying to lock in.
(beeping)
Phone belongs to...
Ensign Jerome Diggs out of Cleveland, Ohio.
Somewhere on the bayou.
It'll be daylight before we reach him.
I'll call Pride, tell him to meet us there?
Let's move.
(music playing)
(coughing)
(coughs)
(laughs)
Another hand.
No limit, Texas Hold 'Em.
Little blind's 25, big's 50.
Antes doubled every 15 minutes.
Little late to be upping the stakes, hey, big man?
It's my game, my rules.
Hey, look, we're just trying to have some fun.
(coughing)
Fun.
You want fun, there's a casino downtown.
Boy, I am prepared to advance you some betting money.
(clears throat)
What's the vig?
(coughing) Double the advance every hand.
It's too rich for my blood.
You here to complain or win?
(door bangs open)
NCIS.
Hands where I can see 'em.
You Ensign Diggs?
Yes, sir.
What's going on?
More than you realize.
Come on.
Let's go, everybody up.
Come on, let's go, everybody!
You too, Junior.
Get a move on.
I ain't going nowhere.
Not with all my money sitting here.
I had a feeling.
(laughing):
We were just playing a friendly game.
It really smells awful in here.
Smells like stupidity to me.
You know what, uh...
I think you best leave.
You need to put your hands up.
We're shutting this game down.
You're under arrest.
(grunts)
Damn, Christopher.
(grunting)
That was pretty.
But if he's infected, we're gonna have some sick gators on our hands.
Talk to us, Brody.
That's what I'm talking about.
Also heard from the quarantine at the vets hospital.
Ensign Diggs did test positive for bubonic, but they got to him in time.
Fatality rate decreases by 50% once the antibiotic is administered.
They're pretty sure he'll make it.
11 to go.
Let's find us some sailors.
(phone rings) Call coming in.
PRIDE:
That's the crisis center.
Update, Doctors.
Agent Pride, the antibiotics seem to be working with the crewmen showing positive symptoms.
The EV76 vaccine is being administered to everyone else on board the ship.
So far we have only one isolated civilian case connected to a woman, a tourist, staying at a downtown hotel, but we think we got to her in time.
How far outside of the city does the vaccine need to reach?
We're prepared, pharmaceutically, to go all the way to the state border if necessary.
All of the manufacturers have been contacted and they're standing by.
But we still haven't found ground zero.
Agent Lasalle's right.
We can't guarantee it's controlled until we know where it started.
Thank you, Doctors.
We need to get back on that ship.
If it started there, we have to forensically determine the origin of the bacteria.
Okay, I like y'all and I love this job, but...
Relax.
I already volunteered.
When?
As long as the Hazmat suit fits,
I'm good to go.
And Director Vance has sent some qualified help down, too.
Who?
Someone who's built up a possible tolerance having been exposed to bubonic plague ten years ago.
And he's willing to roll the dice again?
I don't know if that agent's brave or just plain pigheaded and foolish.
BATES:
Are you some sort of infectious disease expert, Agent DiNozzo?
Ah.
Do I detect sarcasm, Commander?
I've had my brush with a particularly virulent strain a few years back, but...
I came through smelling like a daisy.
Ah.
You're a lucky man.
I've heard that.
Well, every time something like this pops up, they call me in.
They call me the plague whisperer.
Ah.
Agent Pride.
Don't you look protected.
I feel like an andouille sausage in an extra small casing.
All I heard was "sausage."
But you're dressed correctly because, of course, you have a daughter and this is ground zero, which makes it dangerous.
By the way, Commander, did you shut the ventilation down all over the ship?
Of course.
We followed all standard operating procedures.
What's the status of the crew, Commander?
Everyone remains on lockdown in their assigned berthings.
Our corpsmen are still making rounds, giving every person a thorough exam and administering the vaccine as necessary.
So where was the ship recently?
We've been conducting training exercises nonstop the last few months.
Started off Cape Horn, up the Peru-Chile Trench to the Panama Canal.
Passed Cuba to the Tropic of Cancer and back into the Gulf.
Make any stops along the way?
Just for fuel and supplies but no one left the pier.
New Orleans was the first liberty the crew has had in weeks.
We're going to need to see the manifest and ship's log.
That's not a problem.
We should start with Lieutenant Collier's stateroom.
Well, that's in O-Country.
All right.
Here we go.
Appreciate the company.
I appreciate you coming down.
Not exactly a social call.
You kidding me?
Every time I get a gig like this, they double my vacation time.
Is it worth it?
You've never been on vacation with me.
Hello.
You must be Sebastian Lund.
I could spot a forensic geek from a mile away.
Sebastian, allow me to introduce
Carol Wilson, lab tech extraordinaire from the CDC.
You keep laying on that Southern charm, Doc, and I might not leave when this case is over.
(chuckles) It's nice to meet you, sweetie.
Pleasure.
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm not used to working with strangers in my lab.
Especially not on a case as significant as this.
Oh, well, Carol is no stranger.
She's probably one of the sharpest minds in bacterial immunology.
And who doesn't get excited about a plague?
Best in the business.
Dr. Wade's been filling me in.
Look, I'm here to help in any way I can.
See, the thing is what we need is an expert in Yersinia pestis.
So...
Well, that's funny because I minored in pestis in college.
If there's a bad germ out there, this bad girl's gonna find it.
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have some equipment to decontaminate.
No...
You two... carry on.
All right.
Uh, well, let's... dive in.
Ms. Wilson, feel free to get acquainted with my equipment.
Uh, no.
Well,
I wasn't... (clears throat) I wasn't trying to suggest that you actually...
Let's get these synapses fired up, Lund, okay?
Uh, mm...
Lieutenant Collier was something of a neat freak.
Collier led by example.
He was always a squared-away officer.
Wish I could have seen this coming.
Nothing you could have done about it, Commander.
I'm responsible for everyone on this ship.
If the contagion started here, I want to know how and why.
Trash collecting.
Who knew there'd be a Fred Sanford element to my very special career?
Bad news, gentlemen.
Come with me.
Any vitals?
Same signs.
Same plague.
And no one noticed?
Duncan apparently said he was tired.
He went to sleep.
He never woke.
We're gonna have to search his whole quarters.
(soft squeaking) Top to bottom.
Shh.
Hold on.
(soft squeaking) What is it, DiNozzo?
Do you hear that?
Something...
Is it coming from the walls?
(squeaking, scratching)
It's like a scra...
It's over here.
(scratching) What is that?
Oh, boy.
Oh!
Hey, look out!
Look out.
There it is.
Get it.
BATES:
Where is it?
Here... here it goes.
(squeaking) Well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.
Can I go home now?
How can something so small be so dangerous?
Actually, Agent Brody, he's innocent.
And totally healthy.
Blood work came back negative.
No plague at all?
That's right.
No sign of bacterial infection.
Well, if it wasn't a rat, what else could it be?
(computer beeping) Uh-oh.
BRODY:
What's uh-oh?
I don't like "uh-oh."
Skin samples from both Lieutenant Collier and the ensign appear to be the same.
Both men were infected by the same strain of plague.
That's not exactly a surprise.
Yeah, but the purity of the strain is.
Guys, this is a version of the plague that couldn't have come from a flea or a cute little rat.
This abomination didn't occur naturally.
It happened in a lab.
It's a synthesized and manufactured bacteria.
So neither of our victims were infected by accident.
This ship was targeted, as in military terrorism.
And by sending them out on liberty...
Our own sailors become weapons of mass destruction.
(low, indistinct chatter)
I've been calling your cell.
You're not answering.
Left my phone on my desk.
Sorry.
You want some coffee?
There's... a fresh pot.
The beans are from Spitfire.
You're clearly not planning on getting any sleep.
Too much on my mind.
Didn't sleep in 2005.
No point trying now.
Two dead.
How many more...
infected?
How much can the... city take?
How much more can the city handle?
Dwayne Cassius Pride, you listen to me.
You want to see strength?
You ain't seen nothin' yet.
I'll get the coffee.
ABBY:
Only a handful of laboratories in the world have access to a strain this powerful.
The question is, which one did it come from?
I know the bubonic and this offspring are crazy potent.
Don't you just love her?
We know for sure that... the Geronimo was circling South America, right?
In Chincha, Peru, it's common to eat cat.
Cats can carry Toxoplasma that can cause toxoplasmosis.
Okay, okay, okay.
True but gross.
And why?
Well, toxoplasmosis just happens to be one of the many diseases
Navy Medical Research Unit 6 studies in their lab at Lima.
Including plague.
Number Six is like the Fort Knox of bad germs.
It's like the world's most secure petri dish.
Yeah, and no one on the ship had any business being there.
How did it get on board?
I mean, it didn't just hitch a ride.
Or did it?
The evidence that Agent Pride brought in-- what did the victims have in their trash cans?
Well, there was some dental floss, gum wrappers, one questionable magazine.
Someone left some chewing tobacco gnawed up in a big ball.
That's nasty.
And there were muffin wrappers in both.
One blueberry and one... bran.
Uh-huh.
Now prove they were tampered with.
Yeah, running them.
Looks like both foil wrappers had tiny needle punctures in the outer paper.
Yeah, and I'm picking up a high concentration of Yersinia pestis in the remaining crumbs.
They must have come from the ship's galley or ward room.
Okay, so connect baked goods to darkest Peru.
Sebastian, you're a genius.
Namru Six in Lima had a security breach two weeks ago.
They kept it on the down low, but someone entered the live contagion unit.
Muffins?
Bad ones.
Filled with the plague.
Where'd they come from?
The galley.
It says in the manifest
Culinary Specialist,
Second Class Petty Officer Linus Warren signed for supplies in port in Lima.
Who is he?
Petty Officer Warren.
One of the three sailors still missing.
Linus is up to his eyeballs in debt.
Headed for bankruptcy.
That's motive.
Yeah, but he's got a history of charity work.
He volunteers all over the world, including a place in Central City the last time he was here.
Café Reconcile.
Read about it in one of my books.
It was started years ago as a youth support center.
PRIDE:
Call them.
Find out if he's there.
(siren chirps)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hands in the air!
Don't move!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
NCIS!
Hands up!
Turn around!
Petty Officer Linus Warren, we've been looking for you.
Why?
What did I do?
I was on liberty;
I didn't do anything wrong, I swear!
What happened to these guys?
They're dead.
Bubonic plague, not pretty.
You a baker, Linus?
Yes, sir, that's what I do.
Hm, and I'm sure you not answering a dozen calls from your XO,
NCIS and Navy HQ is just a coincidence.
My phone broke.
I was planning on being back at the ship when liberty ended.
People are dying,
Petty Officer Warren, and we think you're responsible.
We think you poisoned them.
How?
Namru Six ring a bell?
Nam...
I don't know what you're talking about!
I didn't kill anybody.
I just bake.
I needed to chill and unwind.
I called some friends at the café here in town, and they said to come on over.
This is messed up, man.
This is crazy.
I couldn't kill anybody.
You just bake.
Yes, sir, I just bake.
What do you mean, it came from the mess?
Muffins, to be exact, Commander.
And somebody had to get to them.
And you think one of my crew did this?
Somebody from my ship?
It had to be somebody on board.
You tell me.
Agent Pride, I don't understand what you're asking.
Did anybody else board the Geronimo, Commander?
No.
All crew and passengers aboard were registered in the manifest.
Then forgive my redundancy, but... could you please run me through things one more time?
As we discussed, the ship stopped in Lima to refuel and get supplies.
And no crew left the pier?
No one.
But there was an adjustment.
There was an adjustment to the ship's medical team.
Dr. Hufcutt?
You offer rides to civilians sometimes?
He transferred via helo.
While we were already at sea, not in port.
But close enough, Commander.
Can you tell me where I might find the doctor?
Well, if he's not at the crisis center, he lives in Baton Rouge.
That's where his pharmaceutical company is based.
You don't think...
I don't think, ma'am.
I know.
Give me something.
Dr. Mitchell Hufcutt, founder of Hufcutt Pharmaceuticals.
The company smartly made alliances with the military, providing combat meds to field hospitals for the past few years.
His reputation alone gave him access to the labs in Lima.
How's business now?
Terrible.
Several bad investments have him on the verge of collapse.
Is that a big ol' motive I hear around the corner?
Hufcutt takes advantage of the navy to steal and create a plague he can vaccinate against.
Like the bird flu scare a few years ago.
He'd make hundreds of millions on the antibiotics alone.
He manufactured the vaccine, too.
Doesn't sound like a coincidence to me.
So where is he now?
No one knows.
We called his home, his office.
He's vanished, fell off the grid.
All right, track everything, credit cards, cell phones.
I want to know when he unzips his fly in the men's bathroom.
Find the son of a bitch.
Where you going?
Need to see a doctor, stat.
DR. HALEY:
Look, I'm sorry, Agent Pride, but I don't know.
I came home to take a shower.
The last two days have been difficult, to say the least.
I need to get back to the crisis center.
I don't doubt that, Dr. Haley, I just...
You and I have been through plenty over the years.
I just need to know if there's anything you talked with Dr. Hufcutt about.
(sighs)
He mentioned he had an important event to go to in Jackson.
A convention of some kind.
Something he said we actually relevant to our dire situation.
What kind of convention?
I assume something medical.
There's a gathering of physicians from all over the world happening.
I suppose it's possible.
But why now?
Why when he's needed so badly here?
Germs travel, Doctor.
Bigger crisis means more vaccine.
More medicine means more money.
(car door closes)
Tell me about the convention in Jackson.
An organization called Doctors International Outreach.
Doctors from around the globe get together and share cases.
And then they go home.
Infected and carrying a bacteria Hufcutt's company can medicate.
Treating thousands of victims.
The doctor's going global.
And the clue trail is next to impossible to track.
Not if we can stop him.
Dr. Hufcutt just turned his cell phone on for a minute.
I got him.
Can you track it?
I can do one better.
I can run his ass off the road.
(bells clanging)
NCIS.
Where the hell do you think you're going, Doctor?
Hey, what are you doing?
!
Huh?
I didn't do anything.
Let me go.
Dr. Mitchell Hufcutt, you are under arrest for murder and domestic terrorism.
What?
Where's the bacteria you stole?
And be careful what you say, because I might just ram it right down your pathetic little throat.
I don't know what you're talking about.
This is crazy!
Let me go!
Wait...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, you can't do this.
Hey, whoa, whoa.
Stop!
I can't swim!
No!
No!
Please.
Please don't do this.
I made a mistake.
The bacteria's safe;
it's in the car.
Aah!
King.
Please.
(Hufcutt panting)
BRODY:
This place is kind of beautiful.
I'm getting some serious reading done.
LASALLE:
Well, I'm getting some bites.
A lot to be grateful for.
People are healthy, bacteria's contained.
Catfish don't know I'm using my secret weapon.
What is it?
Moldy cheese and fatback.
And you expect me to eat what you catch?
If you don't, I will.
Come on, baby.
Come on.
You know you want it.
Take it.
Come on, baby.
Come to Daddy.
Come on now.
I'm right here waiting for you.
Is he really talking to that fish like he's Barry White?
LASALLE:
Come on.
Called foreplay, Brody.
Every good fisherman knows how to tease with the best of them.
(phone ringing)
This is Pride.
One marine's been shot?
Call the morgue.
We'll reach out to the family.
This is an NCIS case now.
And we're back to work.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Hey, Lieutenant, you okay?
Take a load off, man!
Relax!
I'm, uh...
I'm fine.
Yeah!
Hey.
How you doin' tonight?
You look like you could use something cold.
Yeah.
Just... some water, please.
That's all.
Thank you.
Darlin', why don't you go get some air, okay?
Relax a little.
Hey.
Navy.
Navy, you all right?
My God!
Whoa, easy.

New Orleans 1x02 ♪ Carrier Original Air Date on September 30, 2014
You concentrate any harder, you're gonna strain a muscle.
I am learning about New Orleans.
Coming from the Great Lakes,
I want to soak up all the history and culture that I can.
It'll make me a better agent.
Well, you don't need a book to do that.
I'm new to the Gulf.
I need all the help I can get.
Tell me one thing you know that I can't read about.
Chicken Fried Raymond.
Who?
Chicken Fried Cornelius Raymond.
Street musician.
Corner of Dauphine and Conti.
Been standing' there for years.
Got kicked in the mouth by a buggy horse.
Tooth flew into the newly repaved concrete.
Still there now, crown and all.
That's disgusting.
You can't find that in a history book.
Got another one.
Streetcar 952 that ran on the Desire line started right here.
A little slice of Americana.
In all the nooks and crannies.
Pride here.
When?
Call the morgue.
Tell 'em we'll be right there.
What we got?
USS Geronimo's in port, and the crew's on liberty.
One of her officers got hit by a taxi early this morning in the French Quarter.
Are you going to speak to his XO?
Next on my to-do list.
Grab your things.
Did you know in 1923 there was a train accident?
This horse-drawn delivery truck was crossing the rails when out of nowhere...
Are you gonna do this all day?
Do what?
My mother always said, "Look both ways before crossing."
Now I realize she meant physically and metaphorically.
Why did the chicken cross the road, Loretta?
In this instance,
"to get to the other side" is clearly a misnomer.
A simple case of man versus car.
Bartender says Navy Lieutenant Lewis Collier was behaving erratically, having trouble focusing.
Seem like he was on something?
Drugged?
I won't know till I do a full blood panel back at the morgue.
Something had him jacked-up.
Had to be something in his system.
Either he took it...
Or was forced to.
Blood alcohol levels indicate he wasn't inebriated.
Petechial hemorrhaging could have been from impact but... the whites of his eyes, yellow and jaundiced like he overdosed.
The lieutenant is a plethora of contradictions.
Let me rephrase the question.
Why did the sailor cross the road?
Let me rephrase the answer.
The sailor crossed against his will.
Something made him do it.
Now he's dead.
Anything?
Collier's XO, Commander Bates, is currently back on board the Geronimo.
We're meeting in an hour.
Details from Loretta?
She and Sebastian have started the autopsy.
Anything on the lieutenant?
Lieutenant Lewis Collier, 32 years old.
Born and raised in Chatham, Virginia.
Straight "A"s in college.
No flags on the play.
Engaged to be married.
Navy record?
Spotless.
Not even a rental car parking ticket.
Somebody could've had their eye on Collier the minute he stepped ashore.
Could've followed him, drugged him at dinner.
It's happened before.
It fits the M.O.
Wait for the drugs to kick in, follow him back to port, mug him along the way.
He just... never got that far.
It'll show up in the labs.
Maybe.
Pride, Collier's fiancée just flew in.
Let's see what she can tell us.
You didn't know Lewis.
He was... so sweet, so gentle.
You're right.
I-I didn't know the lieutenant.
But I know his shipmates were having a good time last night.
A-And I know he might've taken something accidentally.
Or someone gave him something.
Lewis liked to have fun, but he was super careful.
He worked out, watched his diet, took great care of himself.
Navy records don't disagree.
He was the most responsible man that I've ever known.
And yet something happened.
When he was in that bar, everything changed.
Lewis cared about us.
He wanted a family.
He wouldn't do anything stupid to risk that.
Something made him run in front of that car.
Autopsy's happening as we speak.
I loved him.
I'm truly sorry for your loss.
Agent Pride, my fiancé's dead.
Please find out why.
Talk to me, Loretta.
Steinbeck.
Pardon?
Gone are the days when people died of... working too hard in the fields, and old age was a legitimate medical diagnosis.
I bring up Mr. Steinbeck because those were simpler times.
Now it's all about peeling back the layers.
Cases like this are mysteries wrapped in... complex enigmas.
I take it you're curious about this one.
So far all I can determine of the lieutenant is that he had some kind of upper respiratory infection.
Labs back?
Yeah.
A basic analysis.
Nothing out of the ordinary.
White cells, slightly elevated.
Antihistamines were found in his system.
Decongestants.
He must have been feeling flu-ish.
As I said before, no alcohol and no hallucinogenics.
What about a chemical imbalance or TIA?
Something to account for the behavior.
A stroke's doubtful but worth checking.
Pride, Hmm?
you know, there's a snowball truck in the parking lot.
Is that you being polite?
You want me to go?
I appreciate...
You know I appreciate the... guesswork, but you need to let us do our jobs.
Why are you so antsy about him anyway?
He was a good man, good officer.
No signs of bad behavior.
I got a feelin' there's more to it.
As do I.
Mango or chocolate?
Neither.
Until the lieutenant provides me with some much-needed answers,
I prefer to remain sugar-free.
Go.
I think the immigration monument is not far from here.
It's just down the road from here.
I used to patrol this area when I was a deputy.
You know, the late 1800s was a very interesting time in local history.
Yesterday I was reading about the Italian community in New Orleans...
You're really gettin' into this.
There's just so much.
I'm like a sponge.
I want to soak up everything I can.
Don't believe everything you read, Brody.
History's fun, but it's not always accurate.
I want to hear about your days in the sheriff's department.
Nothing much to hear.
Alabama boy moves to New Orleans and does some good.
You're being modest.
Got to be more to it than that.
Some things are better in small bites.
I guess I'm one of 'em.
Commander Bates.
Agent Lasalle, Agent Brody, NCIS.
You're here about Collier.
He was a gifted officer and a good man.
It's a terrible loss.
This is Dr. Mitchell Hufcutt, one of our medical consultants.
He was just offering some grief counseling to my crew.
Glad I was here and available to help.
How are they doing, Doctor?
Wounds take time to heal, whether they're accidental or during times of conflict.
Posttraumatic symptoms will surface eventually.
All we can do is address them one day at a time.
If there's anything more I can do for you, Commander, don't hesitate to ask.
People say Collier was behaving erratically last night, like he was on something.
Does that surprise you?
Very much.
Collier was a pro.
All business.
Does he have any enemies?
None, as far as I know.
But we work under a lot of pressure.
Issues come up on occasion.
What are you getting at?
Wondering if the lieutenant was targeted.
By whom?
We're all mourning this loss together.
You know, I've been in the Navy 15 years, and I've never lost a sailor until now.
You always know it's a possibility in war time, but not during a port visit.
And not like this.
Sebastian?
Oh, nice to see you, Agent Pride.
Everything all right?
Well, yes and no.
Mind telling me about the "no"?
For thousands of years, Agent Pride, people have been reaping the benefits of yoga.
Scholars have traced its roots back to Stone Age shamanism.
It increases blood flow to the brain.
Helps me and others focus in times of trouble.
You troubled about something?
There are certain things that I've come to count on in life.
The Rebirth at the Maple Leaf every Tuesday, the fact that I can do a speed run of Super Mario Bros. 2 in eight and a half minutes, and my trusty Mass Spectrometer, though, not necessarily in that order.
What are you getting at, Sebastian?
Well, I had prepped a sample of Lieutenant Collier's stomach contents for analysis, but I'm getting readings that don't make any sense.
A bacteria that I didn't expect to encounter.
What kind of bacteria?
Oh, I'm not talking about a good kind of bacteria, like in live yogurt cultures, or that Jamie Lee Curtis stuff, but like a real nasty-looking bacteria.
The kind that destroys small cities in Japanese monster movies.
So, anyway, I thought I'd take a moment, center myself, do dolphin pose.
Did it help?
Not especially, no.
But it did give me time to focus and prepare to explore the accuracy of my data.
Something's-something's definitely miscalculated.
How far along is Loretta?
Concluding her autopsy.
She should be handing me all kinds of pertinent information in a matter of...
Uh-oh.
Dr. Wade.
Stop right there!
Go back!
Both of you, get back!
You need a mask in here.
Loretta, what is it?
Are you all right?
Go on, get back!
Both of you!
Wh... hold on.
I've detected septicemia and bacteria in the decedent's lungs.
The sinuses are full of bloody mucus, the bleeding is into the dermis and the internal organs.
Can you make a hypothesis, Mr. Lund?
Well, I mean, it-it could be any number of things really.
Although, the bacteria that you're mentioning explains my Mass Spec concern.
And?
But without definitive sampling I could...
Oh, my.
I got to get my orange vest!
I'm very focused right now.
I know the protocol.
Loretta, what the hell is this?
This man isn't drugged.
He has bubonic plague!
Before I continue, were you all checked?
Head to toe.
Vaccinated, too.
This is the first confirmed case of bubonic plague in a U.S. metropolitan city in decades.
Course of action is Yumen, China.
Happened in Yumen last July.
Man died of the plague, and they closed down the whole city.
Quarantines, roadblocks, you name it.
Swift action prevented an outbreak.
Of course, we're not there yet, but we need to follow it.
We need to track Collier's path through the city.
Figure out all the people he came in contact with, where he ate, even which bathrooms he used.
Hospitals are on alert.
BOLO's out on anyone showing symptoms.
New Orleans knows how to take on a crisis.
It should.
You've been to hell and back.
And yet, we're still here, Director.
Can't get rid of us that easy.
All right, we're following standard, bio-attack emergency protocol.
Where are we with the Geronimo's
Ship is on lockdown, and we're rounding up sailors from liberty.
Round faster.
Enlist the help of local law enforcement.
If the contagion happened on board, they're all carriers.
I'm on it.
We're gonna need help from the CDC.
Details on symptoms and treatments.
Incubation is two to six days.
Since the crew just started liberty, that means it had to originate on board at sea.
Doc Wade said flu medication was in Collier's blood work.
He was sick, just didn't know how bad.
Mayor, governor, who else knows?
The goal is to keep this orderly, calm and focused.
Sir, it says here that the bubonic plague, going back to the late Middle Ages, was primarily spread by fleas associated with mice and rats.
Water rat could have been on board the whole time.
Or snuck on with food or supplies.
Pride, it's clear we need to contain this situation fast.
If word gets out, a citywide panic would be just as deadly as the plague itself.
Yeah.
That'd be 34 unaccounted for, right?
I got them, I got them.
All right, can I have everybody's attention, please?
We have the full support of the Navy, the Pentagon, and the national health organizations.
Now, as of roll call half an hour ago, there are 34 sailors from the Geronimo still at liberty in the city of New Orleans.
They're all being contacted.
NCIS, in conjunction with local law enforcement, is looking to pick up each and every one of them.
And I can assure you that we won't stop until every crew member is safely returned to the ship and tested.
Doc Wade.
Have there been any reports at local hospitals of civilian patients exhibiting symptoms?
None.
We're in constant communication with the emergency rooms, and there's nothing yet.
We've gathered as much antibiotic and live-attenuated EV76 vaccine as we can.
Bubonic isn't something we had stockpiled.
No one saw this coming.
All we can do is hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
Copies of my autopsy on Lieutenant Collier are being distributed.
As laboratory specifics are determined, you'll be the first to know.
Based on your initial examinations, Dr. Wade, how physically destructive is this bubonic strain?
It's the worst I've ever seen.
Six crew members from the Geronimo were found in the Garden District.
No visible sign of illness.
That's good news.
Sheriff offering air support?
Mounted officers in the Quarter, air and patrol units everywhere else.
Why is finding sailors like herding cats?
I got to say-- murderers, drug dealers, terrorists-- I can take 'em all down.
But chasing a germ scares the hell out of me.
We'll do it together.
Let's get out there and stop this.
We're gonna stop it before it stops New Orleans.
That was Pride.
They just picked up five more from the Geronimo.
Fishing trip on a charter in the gulf.
All of 'em was together.
Any symptoms?
Nothing yet.
Docs are checking.
Local sheriff and NOPD units divided the city into different search quadrants.
Hospitals got phone banks going.
Reaching out to locals, asking if they've seen anything.
We put tracking software on every sailor's cell phone.
Brody, you've been a big help.
Pride and I want you to know we kind of like having you around.
There's been way too much testosterone in this office for too long.
Oh.
You two know I needed a change.
I guess I got lucky.
Cell tracker.
Got a bead on one of the missing crewmen.
It's trying to lock in.
Phone belongs to...
Ensign Jerome Diggs out of Cleveland, Ohio.
Somewhere on the bayou.
It'll be daylight before we reach him.
I'll call Pride, tell him to meet us there?
Let's move.
Another hand.
No limit, Texas Hold 'Em.
Little blind's 25, big's 50.
Antes doubled every 15 minutes.
Little late to be upping the stakes, hey, big man?
It's my game, my rules.
Hey, look, we're just trying to have some fun.
Fun.
You want fun, there's a casino downtown.
Boy, I am prepared to advance you some betting money.
What's the vig?
Double the advance every hand.
It's too rich for my blood.
You here to complain or win?
NCIS.
Hands where I can see 'em.
You Ensign Diggs?
Yes, sir.
What's going on?
More than you realize.
Come on.
Let's go, everybody up.
Come on, let's go, everybody!
You too, Junior.
Get a move on.
I ain't going nowhere.
Not with all my money sitting here.
I had a feeling.
We were just playing a friendly game.
It really smells awful in here.
Smells like stupidity to me.
You know what, uh...
I think you best leave.
You need to put your hands up.
We're shutting this game down.
You're under arrest.
Damn, Christopher.
That was pretty.
But if he's infected, we're gonna have some sick gators on our hands.
Talk to us, Brody.
That's what I'm talking about.
Also heard from the quarantine at the vets hospital.
Ensign Diggs did test positive for bubonic, but they got to him in time.
Fatality rate decreases by 50% once the antibiotic is administered.
They're pretty sure he'll make it.
11 to go.
Let's find us some sailors.
Call coming in.
That's the crisis center.
Update, Doctors.
Agent Pride, the antibiotics seem to be working with the crewmen showing positive symptoms.
The EV76 vaccine is being administered to everyone else on board the ship.
So far we have only one isolated civilian case connected to a woman, a tourist, staying at a downtown hotel, but we think we got to her in time.
How far outside of the city does the vaccine need to reach?
We're prepared, pharmaceutically, to go all the way to the state border if necessary.
All of the manufacturers have been contacted and they're standing by.
But we still haven't found ground zero.
Agent Lasalle's right.
We can't guarantee it's controlled until we know where it started.
Thank you, Doctors.
We need to get back on that ship.
If it started there, we have to forensically determine the origin of the bacteria.
Okay, I like y'all and I love this job, but...
Relax.
I already volunteered.
When?
As long as the Hazmat suit fits,
I'm good to go.
And Director Vance has sent some qualified help down, too.
Who?
Someone who's built up a possible tolerance having been exposed to bubonic plague ten years ago.
And he's willing to roll the dice again?
I don't know if that agent's brave or just plain pigheaded and foolish.
Are you some sort of infectious disease expert, Agent DiNozzo?
Ah.
Do I detect sarcasm, Commander?
I've had my brush with a particularly virulent strain a few years back, but...
I came through smelling like a daisy.
Ah.
You're a lucky man.
I've heard that.
Well, every time something like this pops up, they call me in.
They call me the plague whisperer.
Ah.
Agent Pride.
Don't you look protected.
I feel like an andouille sausage in an extra small casing.
All I heard was "sausage."
But you're dressed correctly because, of course, you have a daughter and this is ground zero, which makes it dangerous.
By the way, Commander, did you shut the ventilation down all over the ship?
Of course.
We followed all standard operating procedures.
What's the status of the crew, Commander?
Everyone remains on lockdown in their assigned berthings.
Our corpsmen are still making rounds, giving every person a thorough exam and administering the vaccine as necessary.
So where was the ship recently?
We've been conducting training exercises nonstop the last few months.
Started off Cape Horn, up the Peru-Chile Trench to the Panama Canal.
Passed Cuba to the Tropic of Cancer and back into the Gulf.
Make any stops along the way?
Just for fuel and supplies but no one left the pier.
New Orleans was the first liberty the crew has had in weeks.
We're going to need to see the manifest and ship's log.
That's not a problem.
We should start with Lieutenant Collier's stateroom.
Well, that's in O-Country.
All right.
Here we go.
Appreciate the company.
I appreciate you coming down.
Not exactly a social call.
You kidding me?
Every time I get a gig like this, they double my vacation time.
Is it worth it?
You've never been on vacation with me.
Hello.
You must be Sebastian Lund.
I could spot a forensic geek from a mile away.
Sebastian, allow me to introduce
Carol Wilson, lab tech extraordinaire from the CDC.
You keep laying on that Southern charm, Doc, and I might not leave when this case is over.
It's nice to meet you, sweetie.
Pleasure.
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm not used to working with strangers in my lab.
Especially not on a case as significant as this.
Oh, well, Carol is no stranger.
She's probably one of the sharpest minds in bacterial immunology.
And who doesn't get excited about a plague?
Best in the business.
Dr. Wade's been filling me in.
Look, I'm here to help in any way I can.
See, the thing is what we need is an expert in Yersinia pestis.
So...
Well, that's funny because I minored in pestis in college.
If there's a bad germ out there, this bad girl's gonna find it.
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have some equipment to decontaminate.
No...
You two... carry on.
All right.
Uh, well, let's... dive in.
Ms. Wilson, feel free to get acquainted with my equipment.
Uh, no.
Well,
I wasn't...
I wasn't trying to suggest that you actually...
Let's get these synapses fired up, Lund, okay?
Uh, mm...
Lieutenant Collier was something of a neat freak.
Collier led by example.
He was always a squared-away officer.
Wish I could have seen this coming.
Nothing you could have done about it, Commander.
I'm responsible for everyone on this ship.
If the contagion started here, I want to know how and why.
Trash collecting.
Who knew there'd be a Fred Sanford element to my very special career?
Bad news, gentlemen.
Come with me.
Any vitals?
Same signs.
Same plague.
And no one noticed?
Duncan apparently said he was tired.
He went to sleep.
He never woke.
We're gonna have to search his whole quarters.
Top to bottom.
Shh.
Hold on.
What is it, DiNozzo?
Do you hear that?
Something...
Is it coming from the walls?
It's like a scra...
It's over here.
What is that?
Oh, boy.
Oh!
Hey, look out!
Look out.
There it is.
Get it.
Where is it?
Here... here it goes.
Well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.
Can I go home now?
How can something so small be so dangerous?
Actually, Agent Brody, he's innocent.
And totally healthy.
Blood work came back negative.
No plague at all?
That's right.
No sign of bacterial infection.
Well, if it wasn't a rat, what else could it be?
Uh-oh.
What's uh-oh?
I don't like "uh-oh."
Skin samples from both Lieutenant Collier and the ensign appear to be the same.
Both men were infected by the same strain of plague.
That's not exactly a surprise.
Yeah, but the purity of the strain is.
Guys, this is a version of the plague that couldn't have come from a flea or a cute little rat.
This abomination didn't occur naturally.
It happened in a lab.
It's a synthesized and manufactured bacteria.
So neither of our victims were infected by accident.
This ship was targeted, as in military terrorism.
And by sending them out on liberty...
Our own sailors become weapons of mass destruction.
I've been calling your cell.
You're not answering.
Left my phone on my desk.
Sorry.
You want some coffee?
There's... a fresh pot.
The beans are from Spitfire.
You're clearly not planning on getting any sleep.
Too much on my mind.
Didn't sleep in 2005.
No point trying now.
Two dead.
How many more...
infected?
How much can the... city take?
How much more can the city handle?
Dwayne Cassius Pride, you listen to me.
You want to see strength?
You ain't seen nothin' yet.
I'll get the coffee.
Only a handful of laboratories in the world have access to a strain this powerful.
The question is, which one did it come from?
I know the bubonic and this offspring are crazy potent.
Don't you just love her?
We know for sure that... the Geronimo was circling South America, right?
In Chincha, Peru, it's common to eat cat.
Cats can carry Toxoplasma that can cause toxoplasmosis.
Okay, okay, okay.
True but gross.
And why?
Well, toxoplasmosis just happens to be one of the many diseases
Navy Medical Research Unit 6 studies in their lab at Lima.
Including plague.
Number Six is like the Fort Knox of bad germs.
It's like the world's most secure petri dish.
Yeah, and no one on the ship had any business being there.
How did it get on board?
I mean, it didn't just hitch a ride.
Or did it?
The evidence that Agent Pride brought in-- what did the victims have in their trash cans?
Well, there was some dental floss, gum wrappers, one questionable magazine.
Someone left some chewing tobacco gnawed up in a big ball.
That's nasty.
And there were muffin wrappers in both.
One blueberry and one... bran.
Uh-huh.
Now prove they were tampered with.
Yeah, running them.
Looks like both foil wrappers had tiny needle punctures in the outer paper.
Yeah, and I'm picking up a high concentration of Yersinia pestis in the remaining crumbs.
They must have come from the ship's galley or ward room.
Okay, so connect baked goods to darkest Peru.
Sebastian, you're a genius.
Namru Six in Lima had a security breach two weeks ago.
They kept it on the down low, but someone entered the live contagion unit.
Muffins?
Bad ones.
Filled with the plague.
Where'd they come from?
The galley.
It says in the manifest
Culinary Specialist,
Second Class Petty Officer Linus Warren signed for supplies in port in Lima.
Who is he?
Petty Officer Warren.
One of the three sailors still missing.
Linus is up to his eyeballs in debt.
Headed for bankruptcy.
That's motive.
Yeah, but he's got a history of charity work.
He volunteers all over the world, including a place in Central City the last time he was here.
Café Reconcile.
Read about it in one of my books.
It was started years ago as a youth support center.
Call them.
Find out if he's there.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hands in the air!
Don't move!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
NCIS!
Hands up!
Turn around!
Petty Officer Linus Warren, we've been looking for you.
Why?
What did I do?
I was on liberty;
I didn't do anything wrong, I swear!
What happened to these guys?
They're dead.
Bubonic plague, not pretty.
You a baker, Linus?
Yes, sir, that's what I do.
Hm, and I'm sure you not answering a dozen calls from your XO,
NCIS and Navy HQ is just a coincidence.
My phone broke.
I was planning on being back at the ship when liberty ended.
People are dying,
Petty Officer Warren, and we think you're responsible.
We think you poisoned them.
How?
Namru Six ring a bell?
Nam...
I don't know what you're talking about!
I didn't kill anybody.
I just bake.
I needed to chill and unwind.
I called some friends at the café here in town, and they said to come on over.
This is messed up, man.
This is crazy.
I couldn't kill anybody.
You just bake.
Yes, sir, I just bake.
What do you mean, it came from the mess?
Muffins, to be exact, Commander.
And somebody had to get to them.
And you think one of my crew did this?
Somebody from my ship?
It had to be somebody on board.
You tell me.
Agent Pride, I don't understand what you're asking.
Did anybody else board the Geronimo, Commander?
No.
All crew and passengers aboard were registered in the manifest.
Then forgive my redundancy, but... could you please run me through things one more time?
As we discussed, the ship stopped in Lima to refuel and get supplies.
And no crew left the pier?
No one.
But there was an adjustment.
There was an adjustment to the ship's medical team.
Dr. Hufcutt?
You offer rides to civilians sometimes?
He transferred via helo.
While we were already at sea, not in port.
But close enough, Commander.
Can you tell me where I might find the doctor?
Well, if he's not at the crisis center, he lives in Baton Rouge.
That's where his pharmaceutical company is based.
You don't think...
I don't think, ma'am.
I know.
Give me something.
Dr. Mitchell Hufcutt, founder of Hufcutt Pharmaceuticals.
The company smartly made alliances with the military, providing combat meds to field hospitals for the past few years.
His reputation alone gave him access to the labs in Lima.
How's business now?
Terrible.
Several bad investments have him on the verge of collapse.
Is that a big ol' motive I hear around the corner?
Hufcutt takes advantage of the navy to steal and create a plague he can vaccinate against.
Like the bird flu scare a few years ago.
He'd make hundreds of millions on the antibiotics alone.
He manufactured the vaccine, too.
Doesn't sound like a coincidence to me.
So where is he now?
No one knows.
We called his home, his office.
He's vanished, fell off the grid.
All right, track everything, credit cards, cell phones.
I want to know when he unzips his fly in the men's bathroom.
Find the son of a bitch.
Where you going?
Need to see a doctor, stat.
Look, I'm sorry, Agent Pride, but I don't know.
I came home to take a shower.
The last two days have been difficult, to say the least.
I need to get back to the crisis center.
I don't doubt that, Dr. Haley, I just...
You and I have been through plenty over the years.
I just need to know if there's anything you talked with Dr. Hufcutt about.
He mentioned he had an important event to go to in Jackson.
A convention of some kind.
Something he said we actually relevant to our dire situation.
What kind of convention?
I assume something medical.
There's a gathering of physicians from all over the world happening.
I suppose it's possible.
But why now?
Why when he's needed so badly here?
Germs travel, Doctor.
Bigger crisis means more vaccine.
More medicine means more money.
Tell me about the convention in Jackson.
An organization called Doctors International Outreach.
Doctors from around the globe get together and share cases.
And then they go home.
Infected and carrying a bacteria Hufcutt's company can medicate.
Treating thousands of victims.
The doctor's going global.
And the clue trail is next to impossible to track.
Not if we can stop him.
Dr. Hufcutt just turned his cell phone on for a minute.
I got him.
Can you track it?
I can do one better.
I can run his ass off the road.
NCIS.
Where the hell do you think you're going, Doctor?
Hey, what are you doing?
!
Huh?
I didn't do anything.
Let me go.
Dr. Mitchell Hufcutt, you are under arrest for murder and domestic terrorism.
What?
Where's the bacteria you stole?
And be careful what you say, because I might just ram it right down your pathetic little throat.
I don't know what you're talking about.
This is crazy!
Let me go!
Wait...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, you can't do this.
Hey, whoa, whoa.
Stop!
I can't swim!
No!
No!
Please.
Please don't do this.
I made a mistake.
The bacteria's safe;
it's in the car.
Aah!
King.
Please.
This place is kind of beautiful.
I'm getting some serious reading done.
Well, I'm getting some bites.
A lot to be grateful for.
People are healthy, bacteria's contained.
Catfish don't know I'm using my secret weapon.
What is it?
Moldy cheese and fatback.
And you expect me to eat what you catch?
If you don't, I will.
Come on, baby.
Come on.
You know you want it.
Take it.
Come on, baby.
Come to Daddy.
Come on now.
I'm right here waiting for you.
Is he really talking to that fish like he's Barry White?
Come on.
Called foreplay, Brody.
Every good fisherman knows how to tease with the best of them.
This is Pride.
One marine's been shot?
Call the morgue.
We'll reach out to the family.
This is an NCIS case now.
And we're back to work.

(playing lively jazz music)
(whoops)
Hey, Lieutenant, you okay?
Take a load off, man!
Relax!
I'm, uh...
I'm fine.
Yeah!
(whoops)
Hey.
How you doin' tonight?
You look like you could use something cold.
Yeah.
Just... some water, please.
That's all.
Thank you.
Darlin', why don't you go get some air, okay?
Relax a little.
Hey.
Navy.
Navy, you all right?
My God!

New Orleans 1x02 ♪ Carrier Original Air Date on September 30, 2014
You concentrate any harder, you're gonna strain a muscle.
I am learning about New Orleans.
Coming from the Great Lakes,
I want to soak up all the history and culture that I can.
It'll make me a better agent.
Well, you don't need a book to do that.
I'm new to the Gulf.
I need all the help I can get.
Tell me one thing you know that I can't read about.
Chicken Fried Raymond.
Who?
Chicken Fried Cornelius Raymond.
Street musician.
Corner of Dauphine and Conti.
Been standing' there for years.
Got kicked in the mouth by a buggy horse.
Tooth flew into the newly repaved concrete.
Still there now, crown and all.
That's disgusting.
You can't find that in a history book.
Got another one.
Streetcar 952 that ran on the Desire line started right here.
A little slice of Americana.
(phone rings) In all the nooks and crannies.
Pride here.
When?
Call the morgue.
Tell 'em we'll be right there.
What we got?
USS Geronimo's in port, and the crew's on liberty.
One of her officers got hit by a taxi early this morning in the French Quarter.
Are you going to speak to his XO?
Next on my to-do list.
Grab your things.
Did you know in 1923 there was a train accident?
This horse-drawn delivery truck was crossing the rails when out of nowhere...
Are you gonna do this all day?
Do what?
(exhales)
(camera shutter clicking)
My mother always said, "Look both ways before crossing."
Now I realize she meant physically and metaphorically.
Why did the chicken cross the road, Loretta?
In this instance,
"to get to the other side" is clearly a misnomer.
LASALLE:
A simple case of man versus car.
Bartender says Navy Lieutenant Lewis Collier was behaving erratically, having trouble focusing.
Seem like he was on something?
Drugged?
I won't know till I do a full blood panel back at the morgue.
Something had him jacked-up.
Had to be something in his system.
Either he took it...
Or was forced to.
WADE:
Blood alcohol levels indicate he wasn't inebriated.
Petechial hemorrhaging could have been from impact but... the whites of his eyes, yellow and jaundiced like he overdosed.
The lieutenant is a plethora of contradictions.
Let me rephrase the question.
Why did the sailor cross the road?
Let me rephrase the answer.
The sailor crossed against his will.
Something made him do it.
Now he's dead.
(sighs) Anything?
Collier's XO, Commander Bates, is currently back on board the Geronimo.
We're meeting in an hour.
Details from Loretta?
She and Sebastian have started the autopsy.
Anything on the lieutenant?
(phone rings) LASALLE:
Lieutenant Lewis Collier, 32 years old.
Born and raised in Chatham, Virginia.
Straight "A"s in college.
No flags on the play.
Engaged to be married.
Navy record?
Spotless.
Not even a rental car parking ticket.
Somebody could've had their eye on Collier the minute he stepped ashore.
Could've followed him, drugged him at dinner.
It's happened before.
It fits the M.O.
Wait for the drugs to kick in, follow him back to port, mug him along the way.
He just... never got that far.
It'll show up in the labs.
Maybe.
Pride, Collier's fiancée just flew in.
Let's see what she can tell us.
WOMAN:
You didn't know Lewis.
He was... so sweet, so gentle.
You're right.
I-I didn't know the lieutenant.
But I know his shipmates were having a good time last night.
A-And I know he might've taken something accidentally.
Or someone gave him something.
Lewis liked to have fun, but he was super careful.
He worked out, watched his diet, took great care of himself.
Navy records don't disagree.
He was the most responsible man that I've ever known.
And yet something happened.
When he was in that bar, everything changed.
Lewis cared about us.
He wanted a family.
He wouldn't do anything stupid to risk that.
Something made him run in front of that car.
Autopsy's happening as we speak.
I loved him.
(sobs)
I'm truly sorry for your loss.
Agent Pride, my fiancé's dead.
Please find out why.
Talk to me, Loretta.
Steinbeck.
Pardon?
Gone are the days when people died of... working too hard in the fields, and old age was a legitimate medical diagnosis.
I bring up Mr. Steinbeck because those were simpler times.
Now it's all about peeling back the layers.
Cases like this are mysteries wrapped in... complex enigmas.
I take it you're curious about this one.
So far all I can determine of the lieutenant is that he had some kind of upper respiratory infection.
Labs back?
Yeah.
A basic analysis.
Nothing out of the ordinary.
White cells, slightly elevated.
Antihistamines were found in his system.
Decongestants.
He must have been feeling flu-ish.
As I said before, no alcohol and no hallucinogenics.
What about a chemical imbalance or TIA?
Something to account for the behavior.
A stroke's doubtful but worth checking.
Pride, Hmm?
you know, there's a snowball truck in the parking lot.
Is that you being polite?
You want me to go?
I appreciate...
You know I appreciate the... guesswork, but you need to let us do our jobs.
Why are you so antsy about him anyway?
He was a good man, good officer.
No signs of bad behavior.
I got a feelin' there's more to it.
As do I.
Mango or chocolate?
(chuckles):
Neither.
Until the lieutenant provides me with some much-needed answers,
I prefer to remain sugar-free.
Go.
(ship horn blows)
I think the immigration monument is not far from here.
It's just down the road from here.
I used to patrol this area when I was a deputy.
You know, the late 1800s was a very interesting time in local history.
Yesterday I was reading about the Italian community in New Orleans...
You're really gettin' into this.
There's just so much.
I'm like a sponge.
I want to soak up everything I can.
Don't believe everything you read, Brody.
History's fun, but it's not always accurate.
I want to hear about your days in the sheriff's department.
Nothing much to hear.
Alabama boy moves to New Orleans and does some good.
You're being modest.
Got to be more to it than that.
Some things are better in small bites.
I guess I'm one of 'em.
Commander Bates.
Agent Lasalle, Agent Brody, NCIS.
You're here about Collier.
He was a gifted officer and a good man.
It's a terrible loss.
This is Dr. Mitchell Hufcutt, one of our medical consultants.
He was just offering some grief counseling to my crew.
Glad I was here and available to help.
How are they doing, Doctor?
Wounds take time to heal, whether they're accidental or during times of conflict.
Posttraumatic symptoms will surface eventually.
All we can do is address them one day at a time.
If there's anything more I can do for you, Commander, don't hesitate to ask.
People say Collier was behaving erratically last night, like he was on something.
Does that surprise you?
Very much.
Collier was a pro.
All business.
Does he have any enemies?
None, as far as I know.
But we work under a lot of pressure.
Issues come up on occasion.
What are you getting at?
Wondering if the lieutenant was targeted.
By whom?
We're all mourning this loss together.
You know, I've been in the Navy 15 years, and I've never lost a sailor until now.
You always know it's a possibility in war time, but not during a port visit.
And not like this.
Sebastian?
Oh, nice to see you, Agent Pride.
Everything all right?
Well, yes and no.
Mind telling me about the "no"?
(sighs)
For thousands of years, Agent Pride, people have been reaping the benefits of yoga.
Scholars have traced its roots back to Stone Age shamanism.
It increases blood flow to the brain.
Helps me and others focus in times of trouble.
You troubled about something?
There are certain things that I've come to count on in life.
The Rebirth at the Maple Leaf every Tuesday, the fact that I can do a speed run of Super Mario Bros. 2 in eight and a half minutes, and my trusty Mass Spectrometer, though, not necessarily in that order.
What are you getting at, Sebastian?
Well, I had prepped a sample of Lieutenant Collier's stomach contents for analysis, but I'm getting readings that don't make any sense.
A bacteria that I didn't expect to encounter.
What kind of bacteria?
Oh, I'm not talking about a good kind of bacteria, like in live yogurt cultures, or that Jamie Lee Curtis stuff, but like a real nasty-looking bacteria.
The kind that destroys small cities in Japanese monster movies.
So, anyway, I thought I'd take a moment, center myself, do dolphin pose.
Did it help?
Not especially, no.
But it did give me time to focus and prepare to explore the accuracy of my data.
Something's-something's definitely miscalculated.
How far along is Loretta?
Concluding her autopsy.
She should be handing me all kinds of pertinent information in a matter of... (alarm sounding) Uh-oh.
Dr. Wade.
Stop right there!
Go back!
Both of you, get back!
You need a mask in here.
Loretta, what is it?
Are you all right?
Go on, get back!
Both of you!
Wh... hold on.
I've detected septicemia and bacteria in the decedent's lungs.
The sinuses are full of bloody mucus, the bleeding is into the dermis and the internal organs.
Can you make a hypothesis, Mr. Lund?
Well, I mean, it-it could be any number of things really.
Although, the bacteria that you're mentioning explains my Mass Spec concern.
And?
But without definitive sampling I could...
Oh, my.
I got to get my orange vest!
I'm very focused right now.
I know the protocol.
Loretta, what the hell is this?
This man isn't drugged.
He has bubonic plague!
VANCE:
Before I continue, were you all checked?
Head to toe.
Vaccinated, too.
This is the first confirmed case of bubonic plague in a U.S. metropolitan city in decades.
Course of action is Yumen, China.
Happened in Yumen last July.
Man died of the plague, and they closed down the whole city.
Quarantines, roadblocks, you name it.
Swift action prevented an outbreak.
Of course, we're not there yet, but we need to follow it.
We need to track Collier's path through the city.
Figure out all the people he came in contact with, where he ate, even which bathrooms he used.
Hospitals are on alert.
BOLO's out on anyone showing symptoms.
New Orleans knows how to take on a crisis.
It should.
You've been to hell and back.
And yet, we're still here, Director.
Can't get rid of us that easy.
All right, we're following standard, bio-attack emergency protocol.
Where are we with the Geronimo's
Ship is on lockdown, and we're rounding up sailors from liberty.
Round faster.
Enlist the help of local law enforcement.
If the contagion happened on board, they're all carriers.
I'm on it.
PRIDE:
We're gonna need help from the CDC.
Details on symptoms and treatments.
Incubation is two to six days.
Since the crew just started liberty, that means it had to originate on board at sea.
Doc Wade said flu medication was in Collier's blood work.
He was sick, just didn't know how bad.
Mayor, governor, who else knows?
The goal is to keep this orderly, calm and focused.
Sir, it says here that the bubonic plague, going back to the late Middle Ages, was primarily spread by fleas associated with mice and rats.
Water rat could have been on board the whole time.
Or snuck on with food or supplies.
Pride, it's clear we need to contain this situation fast.
If word gets out, a citywide panic would be just as deadly as the plague itself.
(quietly):
Yeah.
PRIDE:
That'd be 34 unaccounted for, right?
(Wade speaks indistinctly) I got them, I got them.
All right, can I have everybody's attention, please?
We have the full support of the Navy, the Pentagon, and the national health organizations.
Now, as of roll call half an hour ago, there are 34 sailors from the Geronimo still at liberty in the city of New Orleans.
They're all being contacted.
NCIS, in conjunction with local law enforcement, is looking to pick up each and every one of them.
And I can assure you that we won't stop until every crew member is safely returned to the ship and tested.
Doc Wade.
Have there been any reports at local hospitals of civilian patients exhibiting symptoms?
None.
We're in constant communication with the emergency rooms, and there's nothing yet.
HUFCUTT:
We've gathered as much antibiotic and live-attenuated EV76 vaccine as we can.
Bubonic isn't something we had stockpiled.
No one saw this coming.
All we can do is hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
Copies of my autopsy on Lieutenant Collier are being distributed.
As laboratory specifics are determined, you'll be the first to know.
Based on your initial examinations, Dr. Wade, how physically destructive is this bubonic strain?
It's the worst I've ever seen.
(indistinct chatter)
Six crew members from the Geronimo were found in the Garden District.
No visible sign of illness.
That's good news.
Sheriff offering air support?
Mounted officers in the Quarter, air and patrol units everywhere else.
Why is finding sailors like herding cats?
I got to say-- murderers, drug dealers, terrorists-- I can take 'em all down.
But chasing a germ scares the hell out of me.
We'll do it together.
Let's get out there and stop this.
We're gonna stop it before it stops New Orleans.
That was Pride.
They just picked up five more from the Geronimo.
Fishing trip on a charter in the gulf.
All of 'em was together.
Any symptoms?
Nothing yet.
Docs are checking.
Local sheriff and NOPD units divided the city into different search quadrants.
Hospitals got phone banks going.
Reaching out to locals, asking if they've seen anything.
We put tracking software on every sailor's cell phone.
Brody, you've been a big help.
Pride and I want you to know we kind of like having you around.
There's been way too much testosterone in this office for too long.
Oh.
You two know I needed a change.
I guess I got lucky.
(beeping) Cell tracker.
Got a bead on one of the missing crewmen.
It's trying to lock in.
(beeping)
Phone belongs to...
Ensign Jerome Diggs out of Cleveland, Ohio.
Somewhere on the bayou.
It'll be daylight before we reach him.
I'll call Pride, tell him to meet us there?
Let's move.
(music playing)
(coughing)
(coughs)
(laughs)
Another hand.
No limit, Texas Hold 'Em.
Little blind's 25, big's 50.
Antes doubled every 15 minutes.
Little late to be upping the stakes, hey, big man?
It's my game, my rules.
Hey, look, we're just trying to have some fun.
(coughing)
Fun.
You want fun, there's a casino downtown.
Boy, I am prepared to advance you some betting money.
(clears throat)
What's the vig?
(coughing) Double the advance every hand.
It's too rich for my blood.
You here to complain or win?
(door bangs open)
NCIS.
Hands where I can see 'em.
You Ensign Diggs?
Yes, sir.
What's going on?
More than you realize.
Come on.
Let's go, everybody up.
Come on, let's go, everybody!
You too, Junior.
Get a move on.
I ain't going nowhere.
Not with all my money sitting here.
I had a feeling.
(laughing):
We were just playing a friendly game.
It really smells awful in here.
Smells like stupidity to me.
You know what, uh...
I think you best leave.
You need to put your hands up.
We're shutting this game down.
You're under arrest.
(grunts)
Damn, Christopher.
(grunting)
That was pretty.
But if he's infected, we're gonna have some sick gators on our hands.
Talk to us, Brody.
That's what I'm talking about.
Also heard from the quarantine at the vets hospital.
Ensign Diggs did test positive for bubonic, but they got to him in time.
Fatality rate decreases by 50% once the antibiotic is administered.
They're pretty sure he'll make it.
11 to go.
Let's find us some sailors.
(phone rings) Call coming in.
PRIDE:
That's the crisis center.
Update, Doctors.
Agent Pride, the antibiotics seem to be working with the crewmen showing positive symptoms.
The EV76 vaccine is being administered to everyone else on board the ship.
So far we have only one isolated civilian case connected to a woman, a tourist, staying at a downtown hotel, but we think we got to her in time.
How far outside of the city does the vaccine need to reach?
We're prepared, pharmaceutically, to go all the way to the state border if necessary.
All of the manufacturers have been contacted and they're standing by.
But we still haven't found ground zero.
Agent Lasalle's right.
We can't guarantee it's controlled until we know where it started.
Thank you, Doctors.
We need to get back on that ship.
If it started there, we have to forensically determine the origin of the bacteria.
Okay, I like y'all and I love this job, but...
Relax.
I already volunteered.
When?
As long as the Hazmat suit fits,
I'm good to go.
And Director Vance has sent some qualified help down, too.
Who?
Someone who's built up a possible tolerance having been exposed to bubonic plague ten years ago.
And he's willing to roll the dice again?
I don't know if that agent's brave or just plain pigheaded and foolish.
BATES:
Are you some sort of infectious disease expert, Agent DiNozzo?
Ah.
Do I detect sarcasm, Commander?
I've had my brush with a particularly virulent strain a few years back, but...
I came through smelling like a daisy.
Ah.
You're a lucky man.
I've heard that.
Well, every time something like this pops up, they call me in.
They call me the plague whisperer.
Ah.
Agent Pride.
Don't you look protected.
I feel like an andouille sausage in an extra small casing.
All I heard was "sausage."
But you're dressed correctly because, of course, you have a daughter and this is ground zero, which makes it dangerous.
By the way, Commander, did you shut the ventilation down all over the ship?
Of course.
We followed all standard operating procedures.
What's the status of the crew, Commander?
Everyone remains on lockdown in their assigned berthings.
Our corpsmen are still making rounds, giving every person a thorough exam and administering the vaccine as necessary.
So where was the ship recently?
We've been conducting training exercises nonstop the last few months.
Started off Cape Horn, up the Peru-Chile Trench to the Panama Canal.
Passed Cuba to the Tropic of Cancer and back into the Gulf.
Make any stops along the way?
Just for fuel and supplies but no one left the pier.
New Orleans was the first liberty the crew has had in weeks.
We're going to need to see the manifest and ship's log.
That's not a problem.
We should start with Lieutenant Collier's stateroom.
Well, that's in O-Country.
All right.
Here we go.
Appreciate the company.
I appreciate you coming down.
Not exactly a social call.
You kidding me?
Every time I get a gig like this, they double my vacation time.
Is it worth it?
You've never been on vacation with me.
Hello.
You must be Sebastian Lund.
I could spot a forensic geek from a mile away.
Sebastian, allow me to introduce
Carol Wilson, lab tech extraordinaire from the CDC.
You keep laying on that Southern charm, Doc, and I might not leave when this case is over.
(chuckles) It's nice to meet you, sweetie.
Pleasure.
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm not used to working with strangers in my lab.
Especially not on a case as significant as this.
Oh, well, Carol is no stranger.
She's probably one of the sharpest minds in bacterial immunology.
And who doesn't get excited about a plague?
Best in the business.
Dr. Wade's been filling me in.
Look, I'm here to help in any way I can.
See, the thing is what we need is an expert in Yersinia pestis.
So...
Well, that's funny because I minored in pestis in college.
If there's a bad germ out there, this bad girl's gonna find it.
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have some equipment to decontaminate.
No...
You two... carry on.
All right.
Uh, well, let's... dive in.
Ms. Wilson, feel free to get acquainted with my equipment.
Uh, no.
Well,
I wasn't... (clears throat) I wasn't trying to suggest that you actually...
Let's get these synapses fired up, Lund, okay?
Uh, mm...
Lieutenant Collier was something of a neat freak.
Collier led by example.
He was always a squared-away officer.
Wish I could have seen this coming.
Nothing you could have done about it, Commander.
I'm responsible for everyone on this ship.
If the contagion started here, I want to know how and why.
Trash collecting.
Who knew there'd be a Fred Sanford element to my very special career?
Bad news, gentlemen.
Come with me.
Any vitals?
Same signs.
Same plague.
And no one noticed?
Duncan apparently said he was tired.
He went to sleep.
He never woke.
We're gonna have to search his whole quarters.
(soft squeaking) Top to bottom.
Shh.
Hold on.
(soft squeaking) What is it, DiNozzo?
Do you hear that?
Something...
Is it coming from the walls?
(squeaking, scratching)
It's like a scra...
It's over here.
(scratching) What is that?
Oh, boy.
Oh!
Hey, look out!
Look out.
There it is.
Get it.
BATES:
Where is it?
Here... here it goes.
(squeaking) Well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.
Can I go home now?
How can something so small be so dangerous?
Actually, Agent Brody, he's innocent.
And totally healthy.
Blood work came back negative.
No plague at all?
That's right.
No sign of bacterial infection.
Well, if it wasn't a rat, what else could it be?
(computer beeping) Uh-oh.
BRODY:
What's uh-oh?
I don't like "uh-oh."
Skin samples from both Lieutenant Collier and the ensign appear to be the same.
Both men were infected by the same strain of plague.
That's not exactly a surprise.
Yeah, but the purity of the strain is.
Guys, this is a version of the plague that couldn't have come from a flea or a cute little rat.
This abomination didn't occur naturally.
It happened in a lab.
It's a synthesized and manufactured bacteria.
So neither of our victims were infected by accident.
This ship was targeted, as in military terrorism.
And by sending them out on liberty...
Our own sailors become weapons of mass destruction.
(low, indistinct chatter)
I've been calling your cell.
You're not answering.
Left my phone on my desk.
Sorry.
You want some coffee?
There's... a fresh pot.
The beans are from Spitfire.
You're clearly not planning on getting any sleep.
Too much on my mind.
Didn't sleep in 2005.
No point trying now.
Two dead.
How many more...
infected?
How much can the... city take?
How much more can the city handle?
Dwayne Cassius Pride, you listen to me.
You want to see strength?
You ain't seen nothin' yet.
I'll get the coffee.
ABBY:
Only a handful of laboratories in the world have access to a strain this powerful.
The question is, which one did it come from?
I know the bubonic and this offspring are crazy potent.
Don't you just love her?
We know for sure that... the Geronimo was circling South America, right?
In Chincha, Peru, it's common to eat cat.
Cats can carry Toxoplasma that can cause toxoplasmosis.
Okay, okay, okay.
True but gross.
And why?
Well, toxoplasmosis just happens to be one of the many diseases
Navy Medical Research Unit 6 studies in their lab at Lima.
Including plague.
Number Six is like the Fort Knox of bad germs.
It's like the world's most secure petri dish.
Yeah, and no one on the ship had any business being there.
How did it get on board?
I mean, it didn't just hitch a ride.
Or did it?
The evidence that Agent Pride brought in-- what did the victims have in their trash cans?
Well, there was some dental floss, gum wrappers, one questionable magazine.
Someone left some chewing tobacco gnawed up in a big ball.
That's nasty.
And there were muffin wrappers in both.
One blueberry and one... bran.
Uh-huh.
Now prove they were tampered with.
Yeah, running them.
Looks like both foil wrappers had tiny needle punctures in the outer paper.
Yeah, and I'm picking up a high concentration of Yersinia pestis in the remaining crumbs.
They must have come from the ship's galley or ward room.
Okay, so connect baked goods to darkest Peru.
Sebastian, you're a genius.
Namru Six in Lima had a security breach two weeks ago.
They kept it on the down low, but someone entered the live contagion unit.
Muffins?
Bad ones.
Filled with the plague.
Where'd they come from?
The galley.
It says in the manifest
Culinary Specialist,
Second Class Petty Officer Linus Warren signed for supplies in port in Lima.
Who is he?
Petty Officer Warren.
One of the three sailors still missing.
Linus is up to his eyeballs in debt.
Headed for bankruptcy.
That's motive.
Yeah, but he's got a history of charity work.
He volunteers all over the world, including a place in Central City the last time he was here.
Café Reconcile.
Read about it in one of my books.
It was started years ago as a youth support center.
PRIDE:
Call them.
Find out if he's there.
(siren chirps)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hands in the air!
Don't move!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
NCIS!
Hands up!
Turn around!
Petty Officer Linus Warren, we've been looking for you.
Why?
What did I do?
I was on liberty;
I didn't do anything wrong, I swear!
What happened to these guys?
They're dead.
Bubonic plague, not pretty.
You a baker, Linus?
Yes, sir, that's what I do.
Hm, and I'm sure you not answering a dozen calls from your XO,
NCIS and Navy HQ is just a coincidence.
My phone broke.
I was planning on being back at the ship when liberty ended.
People are dying,
Petty Officer Warren, and we think you're responsible.
We think you poisoned them.
How?
Namru Six ring a bell?
Nam...
I don't know what you're talking about!
I didn't kill anybody.
I just bake.
I needed to chill and unwind.
I called some friends at the café here in town, and they said to come on over.
This is messed up, man.
This is crazy.
I couldn't kill anybody.
You just bake.
Yes, sir, I just bake.
What do you mean, it came from the mess?
Muffins, to be exact, Commander.
And somebody had to get to them.
And you think one of my crew did this?
Somebody from my ship?
It had to be somebody on board.
You tell me.
Agent Pride, I don't understand what you're asking.
Did anybody else board the Geronimo, Commander?
No.
All crew and passengers aboard were registered in the manifest.
Then forgive my redundancy, but... could you please run me through things one more time?
As we discussed, the ship stopped in Lima to refuel and get supplies.
And no crew left the pier?
No one.
But there was an adjustment.
There was an adjustment to the ship's medical team.
Dr. Hufcutt?
You offer rides to civilians sometimes?
He transferred via helo.
While we were already at sea, not in port.
But close enough, Commander.
Can you tell me where I might find the doctor?
Well, if he's not at the crisis center, he lives in Baton Rouge.
That's where his pharmaceutical company is based.
You don't think...
I don't think, ma'am.
I know.
Give me something.
Dr. Mitchell Hufcutt, founder of Hufcutt Pharmaceuticals.
The company smartly made alliances with the military, providing combat meds to field hospitals for the past few years.
His reputation alone gave him access to the labs in Lima.
How's business now?
Terrible.
Several bad investments have him on the verge of collapse.
Is that a big ol' motive I hear around the corner?
Hufcutt takes advantage of the navy to steal and create a plague he can vaccinate against.
Like the bird flu scare a few years ago.
He'd make hundreds of millions on the antibiotics alone.
He manufactured the vaccine, too.
Doesn't sound like a coincidence to me.
So where is he now?
No one knows.
We called his home, his office.
He's vanished, fell off the grid.
All right, track everything, credit cards, cell phones.
I want to know when he unzips his fly in the men's bathroom.
Find the son of a bitch.
Where you going?
Need to see a doctor, stat.
DR. HALEY:
Look, I'm sorry, Agent Pride, but I don't know.
I came home to take a shower.
The last two days have been difficult, to say the least.
I need to get back to the crisis center.
I don't doubt that, Dr. Haley, I just...
You and I have been through plenty over the years.
I just need to know if there's anything you talked with Dr. Hufcutt about.
(sighs)
He mentioned he had an important event to go to in Jackson.
A convention of some kind.
Something he said we actually relevant to our dire situation.
What kind of convention?
I assume something medical.
There's a gathering of physicians from all over the world happening.
I suppose it's possible.
But why now?
Why when he's needed so badly here?
Germs travel, Doctor.
Bigger crisis means more vaccine.
More medicine means more money.
(car door closes)
Tell me about the convention in Jackson.
An organization called Doctors International Outreach.
Doctors from around the globe get together and share cases.
And then they go home.
Infected and carrying a bacteria Hufcutt's company can medicate.
Treating thousands of victims.
The doctor's going global.
And the clue trail is next to impossible to track.
Not if we can stop him.
Dr. Hufcutt just turned his cell phone on for a minute.
I got him.
Can you track it?
I can do one better.
I can run his ass off the road.
(bells clanging)
NCIS.
Where the hell do you think you're going, Doctor?
Hey, what are you doing?
!
Huh?
I didn't do anything.
Let me go.
Dr. Mitchell Hufcutt, you are under arrest for murder and domestic terrorism.
What?
Where's the bacteria you stole?
And be careful what you say, because I might just ram it right down your pathetic little throat.
I don't know what you're talking about.
This is crazy!
Let me go!
Wait...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, you can't do this.
Hey, whoa, whoa.
Stop!
I can't swim!
No!
No!
Please.
Please don't do this.
I made a mistake.
The bacteria's safe;
it's in the car.
Aah!
King.
Please.
(Hufcutt panting)
BRODY:
This place is kind of beautiful.
I'm getting some serious reading done.
LASALLE:
Well, I'm getting some bites.
A lot to be grateful for.
People are healthy, bacteria's contained.
Catfish don't know I'm using my secret weapon.
What is it?
Moldy cheese and fatback.
And you expect me to eat what you catch?
If you don't, I will.
Come on, baby.
Come on.
You know you want it.
Take it.
Come on, baby.
Come to Daddy.
Come on now.
I'm right here waiting for you.
Is he really talking to that fish like he's Barry White?
LASALLE:
Come on.
Called foreplay, Brody.
Every good fisherman knows how to tease with the best of them.
(phone ringing)
This is Pride.
One marine's been shot?
Call the morgue.
We'll reach out to the family.
This is an NCIS case now.
And we're back to work.

Hey, Lieutenant, you okay?
Take a load off, man!
Relax!
I'm, uh...
I'm fine.
Yeah!
(whoops)
Hey.
How you doin' tonight?
You look like you could use something cold.
Yeah.
Just... some water, please.
That's all.
Thank you.
Darlin', why don't you go get some air, okay?
Relax a little.
Hey.
Navy.
Navy, you all right?

I am learning about New Orleans.
Coming from the Great Lakes,
I want to soak up all the history and culture that I can.
It'll make me a better agent.
Well, you don't need a book to do that.
I'm new to the Gulf.
I need all the help I can get.
Tell me one thing you know that I can't read about.
Chicken Fried Raymond.
Who?
Chicken Fried Cornelius Raymond.
Street musician.
Corner of Dauphine and Conti.
Been standing' there for years.
Got kicked in the mouth by a buggy horse.
Tooth flew into the newly repaved concrete.
Still there now, crown and all.
That's disgusting.
You can't find that in a history book.
Got another one.
Streetcar 952 that ran on the Desire line started right here.
A little slice of Americana.
(phone rings) In all the nooks and crannies.
Pride here.
When?
Call the morgue.
Tell 'em we'll be right there.
What we got?
USS Geronimo's in port, and the crew's on liberty.
One of her officers got hit by a taxi early this morning in the French Quarter.
Are you going to speak to his XO?
Next on my to-do list.
Grab your things.
Did you know in 1923 there was a train accident?
This horse-drawn delivery truck was crossing the rails when out of nowhere...
Are you gonna do this all day?
Do what?
(exhales)
(camera shutter clicking)
My mother always said, "Look both ways before crossing."
Now I realize she meant physically and metaphorically.
Why did the chicken cross the road, Loretta?
In this instance,
"to get to the other side" is clearly a misnomer.
LASALLE:
A simple case of man versus car.
Bartender says Navy Lieutenant Lewis Collier was behaving erratically, having trouble focusing.
Seem like he was on something?
Drugged?
I won't know till I do a full blood panel back at the morgue.
Something had him jacked-up.
Had to be something in his system.
Either he took it...
Or was forced to.
WADE:
Blood alcohol levels indicate he wasn't inebriated.
Petechial hemorrhaging could have been from impact but... the whites of his eyes, yellow and jaundiced like he overdosed.
The lieutenant is a plethora of contradictions.
Let me rephrase the question.
Why did the sailor cross the road?
Let me rephrase the answer.
The sailor crossed against his will.
Something made him do it.
Now he's dead.
Collier's XO, Commander Bates, is currently back on board the Geronimo.
We're meeting in an hour.
Details from Loretta?
She and Sebastian have started the autopsy.
Anything on the lieutenant?
(phone rings) LASALLE:
Lieutenant Lewis Collier, 32 years old.
Born and raised in Chatham, Virginia.
Straight "A"s in college.
No flags on the play.
Engaged to be married.
Navy record?
Spotless.
Not even a rental car parking ticket.
Somebody could've had their eye on Collier the minute he stepped ashore.
Could've followed him, drugged him at dinner.
It's happened before.
It fits the M.O.
Wait for the drugs to kick in, follow him back to port, mug him along the way.
He just... never got that far.
It'll show up in the labs.
Maybe.
Pride, Collier's fiancée just flew in.
Let's see what she can tell us.
WOMAN:
Youdidn'tknowLewis.
He was... so sweet, so gentle.
You're right.
I-I didn't know the lieutenant.
But I know his shipmates were having a good time last night.
A-And I know he might've taken something accidentally.
Or someone gave him something.
Lewis liked to have fun, but he was super careful.
He worked out, watched his diet, took great care of himself.
Navy records don't disagree.
He was the most responsible man that I've ever known.
And yet something happened.
When he was in that bar, everything changed.
Lewis cared about us.
He wanted a family.
He wouldn't do anything stupid to risk that.
Something made him run in front of that car.
Autopsy's happening as we speak.
I loved him.
(sobs)
I'm truly sorry for your loss.
Agent Pride, my fiancé's dead.
Please find out why.
Talk to me, Loretta.
Steinbeck.
Pardon?
Gone are the days when people died of... working too hard in the fields, and old age was a legitimate medical diagnosis.
I bring up Mr. Steinbeck because those were simpler times.
Now it's all about peeling back the layers.
Cases like this are mysteries wrapped in... complex enigmas.
I take it you're curious about this one.
So far all I can determine of the lieutenant is that he had some kind of upper respiratory infection.
Labs back?
Yeah.
A basic analysis.
Nothing out of the ordinary.
White cells, slightly elevated.
Antihistamines were found in his system.
Decongestants.
He must have been feeling flu-ish.
As I said before, no alcohol and no hallucinogenics.
What about a chemical imbalance or TIA?
Something to account for the behavior.
A stroke's doubtful but worth checking.
Pride, Hmm?
you know, there's a snowball truck in the parking lot.
Is that you being polite?
You want me to go?
I appreciate...
You know I appreciate the... guesswork, but you need to let us do our jobs.
Why are you so antsy about him anyway?
He was a good man, good officer.
No signs of bad behavior.
I got a feelin' there's more to it.
As do I.
Mango or chocolate?
(chuckles):
Neither.
Until the lieutenant provides me with some much-needed answers,
I prefer to remain sugar-free.
Go.
(ship horn blows)
I think the immigration monument is not far from here.
It's just down the road from here.
I used to patrol this area when I was a deputy.
You know, the late 1800s was a very interesting time in local history.
Yesterday I was reading about the Italian community in New Orleans...
You're really gettin' into this.
There's just so much.
I'm like a sponge.
I want to soak up everything I can.
Don't believe everything you read, Brody.
History's fun, but it's not always accurate.
I want to hear about your days in the sheriff's department.
Nothing much to hear.
Alabama boy moves to New Orleans and does some good.
You're being modest.
Got to be more to it than that.
Some things are better in small bites.
I guess I'm one of 'em.
Commander Bates.
Agent Lasalle, Agent Brody, NCIS.
You're here about Collier.
He was a gifted officer and a good man.
It's a terrible loss.
This is Dr. Mitchell Hufcutt, one of our medical consultants.
He was just offering some grief counseling to my crew.
Glad I was here and available to help.
How are they doing, Doctor?
Wounds take time to heal, whether they're accidental or during times of conflict.
Posttraumatic symptoms will surface eventually.
All we can do is address them one day at a time.
If there's anything more I can do for you, Commander, don't hesitate to ask.
People say Collier was behaving erratically last night, like he was on something.
Does that surprise you?
Very much.
Collier was a pro.
All business.
Does he have any enemies?
None, as far as I know.
But we work under a lot of pressure.
Issues come up on occasion.
What are you getting at?
Wondering if the lieutenant was targeted.
By whom?
We're all mourning this loss together.
You know, I've been in the Navy 15 years, and I've never lost a sailor until now.
You always know it's a possibility in war time, but not during a port visit.
And not like this.
Sebastian?
Oh, nice to see you, Agent Pride.
Everything all right?
Well, yes and no.
Mind telling me about the "no"?
(sighs)
For thousands of years, Agent Pride, people have been reaping the benefits of yoga.
Scholars have traced its roots back to Stone Age shamanism.
It increases blood flow to the brain.
Helps me and others focus in times of trouble.
You troubled about something?
There are certain things that I've come to count on in life.
The Rebirth at the Maple Leaf every Tuesday, the fact that I can do a speed run of Super Mario Bros. 2 in eight and a half minutes, and my trusty Mass Spectrometer, though, not necessarily in that order.
What are you getting at, Sebastian?
Well, I had prepped a sample of Lieutenant Collier's stomach contents for analysis, but I'm getting readings that don't make any sense.
A bacteria that I didn't expect to encounter.
What kind of bacteria?
Oh, I'm not talking about a good kind of bacteria, like in live yogurt cultures, or that Jamie Lee Curtis stuff, but like a real nasty-looking bacteria.
The kind that destroys small cities in Japanese monster movies.
So, anyway, I thought I'd take a moment, center myself, do dolphin pose.
Did it help?
Not especially, no.
But it did give me time to focus and prepare to explore the accuracy of my data.
Something's-something's definitely miscalculated.
How far along is Loretta?
Concluding her autopsy.
She should be handing me all kinds of pertinent information in a matter of... (alarm sounding) Uh-oh.
Dr. Wade.
Stop right there!
Go back!
Both of you, get back!
You need a mask in here.
Loretta, what is it?
Are you all right?
Go on, get back!
Both of you!
Wh... hold on.
I've detected septicemia and bacteria in the decedent's lungs.
The sinuses are full of bloody mucus, the bleeding is into the dermis and the internal organs.
Can you make a hypothesis, Mr. Lund?
Well, I mean, it-it could be any number of things really.
Although, the bacteria that you're mentioning explains my Mass Spec concern.
And?
But without definitive sampling I could...
Oh, my.
I got to get my orange vest!
I'm very focused right now.
I know the protocol.
Loretta, what the hell is this?
This man isn't drugged.
He has bubonic plague!
VANCE:
Before I continue, were you all checked?
Head to toe.
Vaccinated, too.
This is the first confirmed case of bubonic plague in a U.S. metropolitan city in decades.
Course of action is Yumen, China.
Happened in Yumen last July.
Man died of the plague, and they closed down the whole city.
Quarantines, roadblocks, you name it.
Swift action prevented an outbreak.
Of course, we're not there yet, but we need to follow suit.
We need to track Collier's path through the city.
Figure out all the people he came in contact with, where he ate, even which bathrooms he used.
Hospitals are on alert.
BOLO's out on anyone showing symptoms.
New Orleans knows how to take on a crisis.
It should.
You've been to hell and back.
And yet, we're still here, Director.
Can't get rid of us that easy.
All right, we're following standard, bio-attack emergency protocol.
Where are we with the Geronimo?
Ship is on lockdown, and we're rounding up sailors from liberty.
Round faster.
Enlist the help of local law enforcement.
If the contagion happened on board, they're all carriers.
I'm on it.
PRIDE:
We're gonna need help from the CDC.
Details on symptoms and treatments.
Incubation is two to six days.
Since the crew just started liberty, that means it had to originate on board at sea.
Doc Wade said flu medication was in Collier's blood work.
He was sick, just didn't know how bad.
Mayor, governor, who else knows?
The goal is to keep this orderly, calm and focused.
Sir, it says here that the bubonic plague, going back to the late Middle Ages, was primarily spread by fleas associated with mice and rats.
Water rat could have been on board the whole time.
Or snuck on with food or supplies.
Pride, it's clear we need to contain this situation fast.
If word gets out, a citywide panic would be just as deadly as the plague itself.
(quietly):
Yeah.
PRIDE:
That'dbe34 unaccounted for,right?
(Wade speaks indistinctly) I got them, I got them.
Okay.
All right, can I have everybody's attention, please?
We have the full support of the Navy, the Pentagon, and the national health organizations.
Now, as of roll call half an hour ago, there are 34 sailors from the Geronimo still at liberty in the city of New Orleans.
They're all being contacted.
NCIS, in conjunction with local law enforcement, is looking to pick up each and every one of them.
And I can assure you that we won't stop until every crew member is safely returned to the ship and tested.
Doc Wade.
Have there been any reports at local hospitals of civilian patients exhibiting symptoms?
None.
We're in constant communication with the emergency rooms, and there's nothing yet.
HUFCUTT:
We've gathered as much antibiotic and live-attenuated EV76 vaccine as we can.
Bubonic isn't something we had stockpiled.
No one saw this coming.
All we can do is hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
Copies of my autopsy on Lieutenant Collier are being distributed.
As laboratory specifics are determined, you'll be the first to know.
Based on your initial examinations, Dr. Wade, how physically destructive is this bubonic strain?
It's the worst I've ever seen.
(indistinct chatter)
Six crew members from the Geronimo were found in the Garden District.
No visible sign of illness.
That's good news.
Sheriff offering air support?
Mounted officers in the Quarter, air and patrol units everywhere else.
Why is finding sailors like herding cats?
I got to say-- murderers, drug dealers, terrorists-- I can take 'em all down.
But chasing a germ scares the hell out of me.
We'll do it together.
Let's get out there and stop this.
We're gonna stop it before it stops New Orleans.
That was Pride.
They just picked up five more from the Geronimo.
Fishing trip on a charter in the gulf.
All of 'em was together.
Any symptoms?
Nothing yet.
Docs are checking.
Local sheriff and NOPD units divided the city into different search quadrants.
Hospitals got phone banks going.
Reaching out to locals, asking if they've seen anything.
We put tracking software on every sailor's cell phone.
Brody, you've been a big help.
Pride and I want you to know we kind of like having you around.
There's been way too much testosterone in this office for too long.
Oh.
You two know I needed a change.
I guess I got lucky.
(beeping) Cell tracker.
Got a bead on one of the missing crewmen.
It's trying to lock in.
(beeping)
Phone belongs to...
Ensign Jerome Diggs out of Cleveland, Ohio.
Somewhere on the bayou.
It'll be daylight before we reach him.
I'll call Pride, tell him to meet us there?
Let's move.
(music playing)
(coughing)
(coughs)
(laughs)
Another hand.
No limit, Texas Hold 'Em.
Little blind's 25, big's 50.
Antes doubled every 15 minutes.
Little late to be upping the stakes, hey, big man?
It's my game, my rules.
Hey, look, we're just trying to have some fun.
(coughing)
Fun.
You want fun, there's a casino downtown.
Boy, I am prepared to advance you some betting money.
(clears throat)
What's the vig?
(coughing) Double the advance every hand.
It's too rich for my blood.
You here to complain or win?
(door bangs open)
NCIS.
Hands where I can see 'em.
You Ensign Diggs?
Yes, sir.
What's going on?
More than you realize.
Come on.
Let's go, everybody up.
Come on, let's go, everybody!
You too, Junior.
Get a move on.
I ain't going nowhere.
Not with all my money sitting here.
I had a feeling.
(laughing):
We were just playing a friendly game.
It really smells awful in here.
Smells like stupidity to me.
You know what, uh...
I think you best leave.
You need to put your hands up.
We're shutting this game down.
You're under arrest.
(grunts)
Damn, Christopher.
(grunting)
That was pretty.
But if he's infected, we're gonna have some sick gators on our hands.
Talk to us, Brody.
That's what I'm talking about.
Also heard from the quarantine at the vets hospital.
Ensign Diggs did test positive for bubonic, but they got to him in time.
Fatality rate decreases by 50% once the antibiotic is administered.
They're pretty sure he'll make it.
11 to go.
Let's find us some sailors.
(phone rings) Call coming in.
PRIDE:
That's the crisis center.
Update, Doctors.
Agent Pride, the antibiotics seem to be working with the crewmen showing positive symptoms.
The EV76 vaccine is being administered to everyone else on board the ship.
So far we have only one isolated civilian case connected to a woman, a tourist, staying at a downtown hotel, but we think we got to her in time.
How far outside of the city does the vaccine need to reach?
We're prepared, pharmaceutically, to go all the way to the state border if necessary.
All of the manufacturers have been contacted and they're standing by.
But we still haven't found ground zero.
Agent Lasalle's right.
We can't guarantee it's controlled until we know where it started.
Thank you, Doctors.
We need to get back on that ship.
If it started there, we have to forensically determine the origin of the bacteria.
Okay, I like y'all and I love this job, but...
Relax.
I already volunteered.
When?
As long as the hazmat suit fits,
I'm good to go.
And Director Vance has sent some qualified help down, too.
Who?
Someone who's built up a possible tolerance having been exposed to bubonic plague ten years ago.
And he's willing to roll the dice again?
I don't know if that agent's brave or just plain pigheaded and foolish.
BATES:
Areyousomesort of infectious disease expert, Agent DiNozzo?
Ah.
Do I detect sarcasm, Commander?
I've had my brush with a particularly virulent strain a few years back, but...
I came through smelling like a daisy.
Ah.
You're a lucky man.
I've heard that.
Well, every time something like this pops up, they call me in.
They call me the plague whisperer.
Ah.
Agent Pride.
Don't you look protected.
I feel like an andouille sausage in an extra small casing.
All I heard was "sausage."
But you're dressed correctly because, of course, you have a daughter and this is ground zero, which makes it dangerous.
By the way, Commander, did you shut the ventilation down
We followed all standard operating procedures.
What's the status of the crew, Commander?
Everyone remains on lockdown in their assigned berthings.
Our corpsmen are still making rounds, giving every person a thorough exam and administering the vaccine as necessary.
So where was the ship recently?
We've been conducting training exercises nonstop the last few months.
Started off Cape Horn, up the Peru-Chile Trench to the Panama Canal.
Passed Cuba to the Tropic of Cancer and back into the Gulf.
Make any stops along the way?
Just for fuel and supplies but no one left the pier.
New Orleans was the first liberty the crew has had in weeks.
We're going to need to see the manifest and ship's log.
That's not a problem.
We should start with Lieutenant Collier's stateroom.
Well, that's in O-Country.
All right.
Here we go.
Appreciate the company.
I appreciate you coming down.
Not exactly a social call.
You kidding me?
Every time I get a gig like this, they double my vacation time.
Is it worth it?
You've never been on vacation with me.
Hello.
You must be Sebastian Lund.
I could spot a forensic geek from a mile away.
Sebastian, allow me to introduce
Carol Wilson, lab tech extraordinaire from the CDC.
You keep laying on that Southern charm, Doc, and I might not leave when this case is over.
(chuckles) It's nice to meet you, sweetie.
Pleasure.
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm not used to working with strangers in my lab.
Especially not on a case as significant as this.
Oh, well, Carol is no stranger.
She's probably one of the sharpest minds in bacterial immunology.
And who doesn't get excited about a plague?
Best in the business.
Dr. Wade's been filling me in.
Look, I'm here to help in any way I can.
See, the thing is what we need is an expert in Yersinia pestis.
So...
Well, that's funny because I minored in pestis in college.
If there's a bad germ out there, this bad girl's gonna find it.
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have some equipment to decontaminate.
No...
You two... carry on.
All right.
Uh, well, let's... dive in.
Ms. Wilson, feel free to get acquainted with my equipment.
Uh, no.
Well,
I wasn't... (clears throat) I wasn't trying to suggest that you actually...
Let's get these synapses fired up, Lund, okay?
Uh, mm...
Lieutenant Collier was something of a neat freak.
Collier led by example.
He was always a squared-away officer.
Wish I could have seen this coming.
Nothing you could have done about it, Commander.
I'm responsible for everyone on this ship.
If the contagion started here, I want to know how and why.
Trash collecting.
Who knew there'd be a Fred Sanford element to my very special career?
Bad news, gentlemen.
Come with me.
Any vitals?
Same signs.
Same plague.
And no one noticed?
Duncan apparently said he was tired.
He went to sleep.
He never woke.
We're gonna have to search his whole quarters.
(soft squeaking) Top to bottom.
Shh.
Hold on.
(soft squeaking) What is it, DiNozzo?
Do you hear that?
Something...
Is it coming from the walls?
(squeaking, scratching)
It's like a scra...
It's over here.
(scratching) What is that?
Oh, boy.
Oh!
Hey, look out!
Look out.
There it is.
Get it.
BATES:
Where is it?
Here... here it goes.
(squeaking) Well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.
Can I go home now?
How can something so small be so dangerous?
Actually, Agent Brody, he's innocent.
And totally healthy.
Blood work came back negative.
No plague at all?
That's right.
No sign of bacterial infection.
Well, if it wasn't a rat, what else could it be?
(computer beeping) Uh-oh.
BRODY:
What's uh-oh?
I don't like "uh-oh."
Skin samples from both Lieutenant Collier and the ensign appear to be the same.
Both men were infected by the same strain of plague.
That's not exactly a surprise.
Yeah, but the purity of the strain is.
Guys, this is a version of the plague that couldn't have come from a flea or a cute little rat.
This abomination didn't occur naturally.
It happened in a lab.
It's a synthesized and manufactured bacteria.
So neither of our victims were infected by accident.
This ship was targeted, as in military terrorism.
And by sending them out on liberty...
Our own sailors become weapons of mass destruction.
(low, indistinct chatter)
I've been calling your cell.
You're not answering.
Left my phone on my desk.
Sorry.
You want some coffee?
There's... a fresh pot.
The beans are from Spitfire.
You're clearly not planning on getting any sleep.
Too much on my mind.
Didn't sleep in 2005.
No point trying now.
Two dead.
How many more...
infected?
How much can the... city take?
How much more can the city handle?
Dwayne Cassius Pride, you listen to me.
You want to see strength?
You ain't seen nothin' yet.
I'll get the coffee.
ABBY:
Only a handful of laboratories in the world have access to a strain this powerful.
The question is, which one did it come from?
I know the bubonic and this offspring are crazy potent.
Don't you just love her?
We know for sure that... the Geronimo was circling South America, right?
In Chincha, Peru, it's common to eat cat.
Cats can carry Toxoplasma that can cause toxoplasmosis.
Okay, okay, okay.
True but gross.
And why?
Well, toxoplasmosis just happens to be one of the many diseases
Navy Medical Research Unit 6 studies in their lab at Lima.
Including plague.
Number Six is like the Fort Knox of bad germs.
It's like the world's most secure petri dish.
Yeah, and no one on the ship had any business being there.
How did it get on board?
I mean, it didn't just hitch a ride.
Or did it?
The evidence that Agent Pride brought in-- what did the victims have in their trash cans?
Well, there was some dental floss, gum wrappers, one questionable magazine.
Someone left some chewing tobacco gnawed up in a big ball.
That's nasty.
And there were muffin wrappers in both.
One blueberry and one... bran.
Uh-huh.
Now prove they were tampered with.
Yeah, running them.
Looks like both foil wrappers had tiny needle punctures in the outer paper.
Yeah, and I'm picking up a high concentration of Yersinia pestis in the remaining crumbs.
They must have come from the ship's galley or ward room.
Okay, so connect baked goods to darkest Peru.
Sebastian, you're a genius.
Namru Six in Lima had a security breach two weeks ago.
They kept it on the down low, but someone entered the live contagion unit.
Muffins?
Bad ones.
Filled with the plague.
Where'd they come from?
The galley.
It says in the manifest
Culinary Specialist,
Second Class Petty Officer Linus Warren signed for supplies in port in Lima.
Who is he?
Petty Officer Warren.
One of the three sailors still missing.
Linus is up to his eyeballs in debt.
Headed for bankruptcy.
That's motive.
Yeah, but he's got a history of charity work.
He volunteers all over the world, including a place in Central City the last time he was here.
Café Reconcile.
Read about it in one of my books.
It was started years ago as a youth support center.
PRIDE:
Call them.
Find out if he's there.
(siren chirps)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hands in the air!
Don't move!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
NCIS!
Hands up!
Turn around!
Petty Officer Linus Warren, we've been looking for you.
Why?
What did I do?
I was on liberty;
I didn't do anything wrong, I swear!
What happened to these guys?
Bubonic plague, not pretty.
You a baker, Linus?
Yes, sir, that's what I do.
Hm, and I'm sure you not answering a dozen calls from your XO,
NCIS and Navy HQ is just a coincidence.
My phone broke.
back at the ship when liberty ended.
People are dying,
Petty Officer Warren, and we think you're responsible.
We think you poisoned them.
How?
Namru Six ring a bell?
Nam...
I don't know what you're talking about!
I didn't kill anybody.
I just bake.
I needed to chill and unwind.
I called some friends at the café here in town, and they said to come on over.
This is messed up, man.
This is crazy.
I couldn't kill anybody.
You just bake.
Yes, sir, I just bake.
What do you mean, it came from the mess?
Muffins, to be exact, Commander.
And somebody had to get to them.
And you think one of my crew did this?
Somebody from my ship?
It had to be somebody on board.
You tell me.
Agent Pride, I don't understand what you're asking.
Did anybody else board the Geronimo, Commander?
No.
All crew and passengers aboard were registered in the manifest.
Then forgive my redundancy, but... could you please run me through things one more time?
As we discussed, the ship stopped in Lima to refuel and get supplies.
And no crew left the pier?
No one.
But there was an adjustment.
There was an adjustment to the ship's medical team.
Dr. Hufcutt?
You offer rides to civilians sometimes?
He transferred via helo.
While we were already at sea, not in port.
But close enough, Commander.
Can you tell me where I might find the doctor?
Well, if he's not at the crisis center, he lives in Baton Rouge.
That's where his pharmaceutical company is based.
You don't think...
I don't think, ma'am.
I know.
Dr. Mitchell Hufcutt, founder of Hufcutt Pharmaceuticals.
The company smartly made alliances with the military, providing combat meds to field hospitals for the past few years.
His reputation alone gave him access to the labs in Lima.
How's business now?
Terrible.
Several bad investments have him on the verge of collapse.
Is that a big ol' motive I hear around the corner?
Hufcutt takes advantage of the navy to steal and create a plague he can vaccinate against.
Like the bird flu scare a few years ago.
He'd make hundreds of millions on the antibiotics alone.
He manufactured the vaccine, too.
Doesn't sound like a coincidence to me.
So where is he now?
No one knows.
We called his home, his office.
He's vanished, fell off the grid.
All right, track everything, credit cards, cell phones.
I want to know when he unzips his fly in the men's bathroom.
Find the son of a bitch.
Where you going?
Need to see a doctor, stat.
DR. HALEY:
Look,I 'msorry,AgentPride, but I don't know.
I came home to take a shower.
The last two days have been difficult, to say the least.
I need to get back to the crisis center.
I don't doubt that, Dr. Haley, I just...
You and I have been through plenty over the years.
I just need to know if there's anything you talked with Dr. Hufcutt about.
(sighs)
He mentioned he had an important event to go to in Jackson.
A convention of some kind.
Something he said we actually relevant to our dire situation.
What kind of convention?
I assume something medical.
There's a gathering of physicians from all over the world happening.
I suppose it's possible.
But why now?
Why when he's needed so badly here?
Germs travel, Doctor.
Bigger crisis means more vaccine.
More medicine means more money.
(car door closes)
Tell me about the convention in Jackson.
An organization called Doctors International Outreach.
Doctors from around the globe get together and share cases.
And then they go home.
Infected and carrying a bacteria Hufcutt's company can medicate.
Treating thousands of victims.
The doctor's going global.
And the clue trail is next to impossible to track.
Not if we can stop him.
Dr. Hufcutt just turned his cell phone on for a minute.
I got him.
Can you track it?
I can do one better.
I can run his ass off the road.
(bells clanging)
NCIS.
Where the hell do you think you're going, Doctor?
Hey, what are you doing?
!
Huh?
I didn't do anything.
Let me go.
Dr. Mitchell Hufcutt, you are under arrest for murder and domestic terrorism.
What?
Where's the bacteria you stole?
And be careful what you say, because I might just ram it right down your pathetic little throat.
I don't know what you're talking about.
This is crazy!
Let me go!
Wait...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, you can't do this.
Hey, whoa, whoa.
Stop!
I can't swim!
No!
No!
Please.
Please don't do this.
I made a mistake.
The bacteria's safe;
it's in the car.
Aah!
King.
Please.
(Hufcutt panting)
BRODY:
This place is kind of beautiful.
I'm getting some serious reading done.
LASALLE:
Well, I'm getting some bites.
A lot to be grateful for.
People are healthy, bacteria's contained.
Catfish don't know I'm using my secret weapon.
What is it?
Moldy cheese and fatback.
And you expect me to eat what you catch?
If you don't, I will.
Come on, baby.
Come on.
You know you want it.
Take it.
Come on, baby.
Come to Daddy.
Come on now.
I'm right here waiting for you.
Is he really talking to that fish like he's Barry White?
LASALLE:
Come on.
Called foreplay, Brody.
Every good fisherman knows how to tease with the best of them.
(phone ringing)
This is Pride.
One marine's been shot?
Call the morgue.
We'll reach out to the family.
This is an NCIS case now.
And we're back to work.

Hey, Lieutenant, you okay?
Take a load off, man!
Relax!
I'm, uh...
I'm fine.

Yeah.
Just... some water, please.
That's all.
Thank you.

You concentrate any harder, you're gonna strain a muscle.
I am learning about New Orleans.
Coming from the Great Lakes,
I want to soak up all the history and culture that I can.
It'll make me a better agent.
Well, you don't need a book to do that.
I'm new to the Gulf.
I need all the help I can get.
Tell me one thing you know that I can't read about.
Chicken Fried Raymond.
Who?
Chicken Fried Cornelius Raymond.
Street musician.
Corner of Dauphine and Conti.
Been standing' there for years.
Got kicked in the mouth by a buggy horse.
Tooth flew into the newly repaved concrete.
Still there now, crown and all.
That's disgusting.
You can't find that in a history book.
Got another one.
Streetcar 952 that ran on the Desire line started right here.
A little slice of Americana.
In all the nooks and crannies.
Pride here.
When?
Call the morgue.
Tell 'em we'll be right there.
What we got?
USS Geronimo's in port, and the crew's on liberty.
One of her officers got hit by a taxi early this morning in the French Quarter.
Are you going to speak to his XO?
Next on my to-do list.
Grab your things.
Did you know in 1923 there was a train accident?
This horse-drawn delivery truck was crossing the rails when out of nowhere...
Are you gonna do this all day?
Do what?
My mother always said, "Look both ways before crossing."
Now I realize she meant physically and metaphorically.
Why did the chicken cross the road, Loretta?
In this instance,
"to get to the other side" is clearly a misnomer.
A simple case of man versus car.
Bartender says Navy Lieutenant Lewis Collier was behaving erratically, having trouble focusing.
Seem like he was on something?
Drugged?
I won't know till I do a full blood panel back at the morgue.
Something had him jacked-up.
Had to be something in his system.
Either he took it...
Or was forced to.
Blood alcohol levels indicate he wasn't inebriated.
Petechial hemorrhaging could have been from impact but... the whites of his eyes, yellow and jaundiced like he overdosed.
The lieutenant is a plethora of contradictions.
Let me rephrase the question.
Why did the sailor cross the road?
Let me rephrase the answer.
The sailor crossed against his will.
Something made him do it.
Now he's dead.
Anything?
Collier's XO, Commander Bates, is currently back on board the Geronimo.
We're meeting in an hour.
Details from Loretta?
She and Sebastian have started the autopsy.
Anything on the lieutenant?
Lieutenant Lewis Collier, 32 years old.
Born and raised in Chatham, Virginia.
Straight "A"s in college.
No flags on the play.
Engaged to be married.
Navy record?
Spotless.
Not even a rental car parking ticket.
Somebody could've had their eye on Collier the minute he stepped ashore.
Could've followed him, drugged him at dinner.
It's happened before.
It fits the M.O.
Wait for the drugs to kick in, follow him back to port, mug him along the way.
He just... never got that far.
It'll show up in the labs.
Maybe.
Pride, Collier's fiancée just flew in.
Let's see what she can tell us.
You didn't know Lewis.
He was... so sweet, so gentle.
You're right.
I-I didn't know the lieutenant.
But I know his shipmates were having a good time last night.
A-And I know he might've taken something accidentally.
Or someone gave him something.
Lewis liked to have fun, but he was super careful.
He worked out, watched his diet, took great care of himself.
Navy records don't disagree.
He was the most responsible man that I've ever known.
And yet something happened.
When he was in that bar, everything changed.
Lewis cared about us.
He wanted a family.
He wouldn't do anything stupid to risk that.
Something made him run in front of that car.
Autopsy's happening as we speak.
I loved him.
I'm truly sorry for your loss.
Agent Pride, my fiancé's dead.
Please find out why.
Talk to me, Loretta.
Steinbeck.
Pardon?
Gone are the days when people died of... working too hard in the fields, and old age was a legitimate medical diagnosis.
I bring up Mr. Steinbeck because those were simpler times.
Now it's all about peeling back the layers.
Cases like this are mysteries wrapped in... complex enigmas.
I take it you're curious about this one.
So far all I can determine of the lieutenant is that he had some kind of upper respiratory infection.
Labs back?
Yeah.
A basic analysis.
Nothing out of the ordinary.
White cells, slightly elevated.
Antihistamines were found in his system.
Decongestants.
He must have been feeling flu-ish.
As I said before, no alcohol and no hallucinogenics.
What about a chemical imbalance or TIA?
Something to account for the behavior.
A stroke's doubtful but worth checking.
Pride, Hmm?
you know, there's a snowball truck in the parking lot.
Is that you being polite?
You want me to go?
I appreciate...
You know I appreciate the... guesswork, but you need to let us do our jobs.
Why are you so antsy about him anyway?
He was a good man, good officer.
No signs of bad behavior.
I got a feelin' there's more to it.
As do I.
Mango or chocolate?
Neither.
Until the lieutenant provides me with some much-needed answers,
I prefer to remain sugar-free.
Go.
I think the immigration monument is not far from here.
It's just down the road from here.
I used to patrol this area when I was a deputy.
You know, the late 1800s was a very interesting time in local history.
Yesterday I was reading about the Italian community in New Orleans...
You're really gettin' into this.
There's just so much.
I'm like a sponge.
I want to soak up everything I can.
Don't believe everything you read, Brody.
History's fun, but it's not always accurate.
I want to hear about your days in the sheriff's department.
Nothing much to hear.
Alabama boy moves to New Orleans and does some good.
You're being modest.
Got to be more to it than that.
Some things are better in small bites.
I guess I'm one of 'em.
Commander Bates.
Agent Lasalle, Agent Brody, NCIS.
You're here about Collier.
He was a gifted officer and a good man.
It's a terrible loss.
This is Dr. Mitchell Hufcutt, one of our medical consultants.
He was just offering some grief counseling to my crew.
Glad I was here and available to help.
How are they doing, Doctor?
Wounds take time to heal, whether they're accidental or during times of conflict.
Posttraumatic symptoms will surface eventually.
All we can do is address them one day at a time.
If there's anything more I can do for you, Commander, don't hesitate to ask.
People say Collier was behaving erratically last night, like he was on something.
Does that surprise you?
Very much.
Collier was a pro.
All business.
Does he have any enemies?
None, as far as I know.
But we work under a lot of pressure.
Issues come up on occasion.
What are you getting at?
Wondering if the lieutenant was targeted.
By whom?
We're all mourning this loss together.
You know, I've been in the Navy 15 years, and I've never lost a sailor until now.
You always know it's a possibility in war time, but not during a port visit.
And not like this.
Sebastian?
Oh, nice to see you, Agent Pride.
Everything all right?
Well, yes and no.
Mind telling me about the "no"?
For thousands of years, Agent Pride, people have been reaping the benefits of yoga.
Scholars have traced its roots back to Stone Age shamanism.
It increases blood flow to the brain.
Helps me and others focus in times of trouble.
You troubled about something?
There are certain things that I've come to count on in life.
The Rebirth at the Maple Leaf every Tuesday, the fact that I can do a speed run of Super Mario Bros. 2 in eight and a half minutes, and my trusty Mass Spectrometer, though, not necessarily in that order.
What are you getting at, Sebastian?
Well, I had prepped a sample of Lieutenant Collier's stomach contents for analysis, but I'm getting readings that don't make any sense.
A bacteria that I didn't expect to encounter.
What kind of bacteria?
Oh, I'm not talking about a good kind of bacteria, like in live yogurt cultures, or that Jamie Lee Curtis stuff, but like a real nasty-looking bacteria.
The kind that destroys small cities in Japanese monster movies.
So, anyway, I thought I'd take a moment, center myself, do dolphin pose.
Did it help?
Not especially, no.
But it did give me time to focus and prepare to explore the accuracy of my data.
Something's-something's definitely miscalculated.
How far along is Loretta?
Concluding her autopsy.
She should be handing me all kinds of pertinent information in a matter of...
Uh-oh.
Dr. Wade.
Stop right there!
Go back!
Both of you, get back!
You need a mask in here.
Loretta, what is it?
Are you all right?
Go on, get back!
Both of you!
Wh... hold on.
I've detected septicemia and bacteria in the decedent's lungs.
The sinuses are full of bloody mucus, the bleeding is into the dermis and the internal organs.
Can you make a hypothesis, Mr. Lund?
Well, I mean, it-it could be any number of things really.
Although, the bacteria that you're mentioning explains my Mass Spec concern.
And?
But without definitive sampling I could...
Oh, my.
I got to get my orange vest!
I'm very focused right now.
I know the protocol.
Loretta, what the hell is this?
This man isn't drugged.
He has bubonic plague!
Before I continue, were you all checked?
Head to toe.
Vaccinated, too.
This is the first confirmed case of bubonic plague in a U.S. metropolitan city in decades.
Course of action is Yumen, China.
Happened in Yumen last July.
Man died of the plague, and they closed down the whole city.
Quarantines, roadblocks, you name it.
Swift action prevented an outbreak.
Of course, we're not there yet, but we need to follow it.
We need to track Collier's path through the city.
Figure out all the people he came in contact with, where he ate, even which bathrooms he used.
Hospitals are on alert.
BOLO's out on anyone showing symptoms.
New Orleans knows how to take on a crisis.
It should.
You've been to hell and back.
And yet, we're still here, Director.
Can't get rid of us that easy.
All right, we're following standard, bio-attack emergency protocol.
Where are we with the Geronimo's
Ship is on lockdown, and we're rounding up sailors from liberty.
Round faster.
Enlist the help of local law enforcement.
If the contagion happened on board, they're all carriers.
I'm on it.
We're gonna need help from the CDC.
Details on symptoms and treatments.
Incubation is two to six days.
Since the crew just started liberty, that means it had to originate on board at sea.
Doc Wade said flu medication was in Collier's blood work.
He was sick, just didn't know how bad.
Mayor, governor, who else knows?
The goal is to keep this orderly, calm and focused.
Sir, it says here that the bubonic plague, going back to the late Middle Ages, was primarily spread by fleas associated with mice and rats.
Water rat could have been on board the whole time.
Or snuck on with food or supplies.
Pride, it's clear we need to contain this situation fast.
If word gets out, a citywide panic would be just as deadly as the plague itself.
Yeah.
That'd be 34 unaccounted for, right?
I got them, I got them.
All right, can I have everybody's attention, please?
We have the full support of the Navy, the Pentagon, and the national health organizations.
Now, as of roll call half an hour ago, there are 34 sailors from the Geronimo still at liberty in the city of New Orleans.
They're all being contacted.
NCIS, in conjunction with local law enforcement, is looking to pick up each and every one of them.
And I can assure you that we won't stop until every crew member is safely returned to the ship and tested.
Doc Wade.
Have there been any reports at local hospitals of civilian patients exhibiting symptoms?
None.
We're in constant communication with the emergency rooms, and there's nothing yet.
We've gathered as much antibiotic and live-attenuated EV76 vaccine as we can.
Bubonic isn't something we had stockpiled.
No one saw this coming.
All we can do is hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
Copies of my autopsy on Lieutenant Collier are being distributed.
As laboratory specifics are determined, you'll be the first to know.
Based on your initial examinations, Dr. Wade, how physically destructive is this bubonic strain?
It's the worst I've ever seen.
Six crew members from the Geronimo were found in the Garden District.
No visible sign of illness.
That's good news.
Sheriff offering air support?
Mounted officers in the Quarter, air and patrol units everywhere else.
Why is finding sailors like herding cats?
I got to say-- murderers, drug dealers, terrorists-- I can take 'em all down.
But chasing a germ scares the hell out of me.
We'll do it together.
Let's get out there and stop this.
We're gonna stop it before it stops New Orleans.
That was Pride.
They just picked up five more from the Geronimo.
Fishing trip on a charter in the gulf.
All of 'em was together.
Any symptoms?
Nothing yet.
Docs are checking.
Local sheriff and NOPD units divided the city into different search quadrants.
Hospitals got phone banks going.
Reaching out to locals, asking if they've seen anything.
We put tracking software on every sailor's cell phone.
Brody, you've been a big help.
Pride and I want you to know we kind of like having you around.
There's been way too much testosterone in this office for too long.
Oh.
You two know I needed a change.
I guess I got lucky.
Cell tracker.
Got a bead on one of the missing crewmen.
It's trying to lock in.
Phone belongs to...
Ensign Jerome Diggs out of Cleveland, Ohio.
Somewhere on the bayou.
It'll be daylight before we reach him.
I'll call Pride, tell him to meet us there?
Let's move.
Another hand.
No limit, Texas Hold 'Em.
Little blind's 25, big's 50.
Antes doubled every 15 minutes.
Little late to be upping the stakes, hey, big man?
It's my game, my rules.
Hey, look, we're just trying to have some fun.
Fun.
You want fun, there's a casino downtown.
Boy, I am prepared to advance you some betting money.
What's the vig?
Double the advance every hand.
It's too rich for my blood.
You here to complain or win?
NCIS.
Hands where I can see 'em.
You Ensign Diggs?
Yes, sir.
What's going on?
More than you realize.
Come on.
Let's go, everybody up.
Come on, let's go, everybody!
You too, Junior.
Get a move on.
I ain't going nowhere.
Not with all my money sitting here.
I had a feeling.
We were just playing a friendly game.
It really smells awful in here.
Smells like stupidity to me.
You know what, uh...
I think you best leave.
You need to put your hands up.
We're shutting this game down.
You're under arrest.
Damn, Christopher.
That was pretty.
But if he's infected, we're gonna have some sick gators on our hands.
Talk to us, Brody.
That's what I'm talking about.
Also heard from the quarantine at the vets hospital.
Ensign Diggs did test positive for bubonic, but they got to him in time.
Fatality rate decreases by 50% once the antibiotic is administered.
They're pretty sure he'll make it.
11 to go.
Let's find us some sailors.
Call coming in.
That's the crisis center.
Update, Doctors.
Agent Pride, the antibiotics seem to be working with the crewmen showing positive symptoms.
The EV76 vaccine is being administered to everyone else on board the ship.
So far we have only one isolated civilian case connected to a woman, a tourist, staying at a downtown hotel, but we think we got to her in time.
How far outside of the city does the vaccine need to reach?
We're prepared, pharmaceutically, to go all the way to the state border if necessary.
All of the manufacturers have been contacted and they're standing by.
But we still haven't found ground zero.
Agent Lasalle's right.
We can't guarantee it's controlled until we know where it started.
Thank you, Doctors.
We need to get back on that ship.
If it started there, we have to forensically determine the origin of the bacteria.
Okay, I like y'all and I love this job, but...
Relax.
I already volunteered.
When?
As long as the Hazmat suit fits,
I'm good to go.
And Director Vance has sent some qualified help down, too.
Who?
Someone who's built up a possible tolerance having been exposed to bubonic plague ten years ago.
And he's willing to roll the dice again?
I don't know if that agent's brave or just plain pigheaded and foolish.
Are you some sort of infectious disease expert, Agent DiNozzo?
Ah.
Do I detect sarcasm, Commander?
I've had my brush with a particularly virulent strain a few years back, but...
I came through smelling like a daisy.
Ah.
You're a lucky man.
I've heard that.
Well, every time something like this pops up, they call me in.
They call me the plague whisperer.
Ah.
Agent Pride.
Don't you look protected.
I feel like an andouille sausage in an extra small casing.
All I heard was "sausage."
But you're dressed correctly because, of course, you have a daughter and this is ground zero, which makes it dangerous.
By the way, Commander, did you shut the ventilation down all over the ship?
Of course.
We followed all standard operating procedures.
What's the status of the crew, Commander?
Everyone remains on lockdown in their assigned berthings.
Our corpsmen are still making rounds, giving every person a thorough exam and administering the vaccine as necessary.
So where was the ship recently?
We've been conducting training exercises nonstop the last few months.
Started off Cape Horn, up the Peru-Chile Trench to the Panama Canal.
Passed Cuba to the Tropic of Cancer and back into the Gulf.
Make any stops along the way?
Just for fuel and supplies but no one left the pier.
New Orleans was the first liberty the crew has had in weeks.
We're going to need to see the manifest and ship's log.
That's not a problem.
We should start with Lieutenant Collier's stateroom.
Well, that's in O-Country.
All right.
Here we go.
Appreciate the company.
I appreciate you coming down.
Not exactly a social call.
You kidding me?
Every time I get a gig like this, they double my vacation time.
Is it worth it?
You've never been on vacation with me.
Hello.
You must be Sebastian Lund.
I could spot a forensic geek from a mile away.
Sebastian, allow me to introduce
Carol Wilson, lab tech extraordinaire from the CDC.
You keep laying on that Southern charm, Doc, and I might not leave when this case is over.
It's nice to meet you, sweetie.
Pleasure.
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm not used to working with strangers in my lab.
Especially not on a case as significant as this.
Oh, well, Carol is no stranger.
She's probably one of the sharpest minds in bacterial immunology.
And who doesn't get excited about a plague?
Best in the business.
Dr. Wade's been filling me in.
Look, I'm here to help in any way I can.
See, the thing is what we need is an expert in Yersinia pestis.
So...
Well, that's funny because I minored in pestis in college.
If there's a bad germ out there, this bad girl's gonna find it.
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have some equipment to decontaminate.
No...
You two... carry on.
All right.
Uh, well, let's... dive in.
Ms. Wilson, feel free to get acquainted with my equipment.
Uh, no.
Well,
I wasn't...
I wasn't trying to suggest that you actually...
Let's get these synapses fired up, Lund, okay?
Uh, mm...
Lieutenant Collier was something of a neat freak.
Collier led by example.
He was always a squared-away officer.
Wish I could have seen this coming.
Nothing you could have done about it, Commander.
I'm responsible for everyone on this ship.
If the contagion started here, I want to know how and why.
Trash collecting.
Who knew there'd be a Fred Sanford element to my very special career?
Bad news, gentlemen.
Come with me.
Any vitals?
Same signs.
Same plague.
And no one noticed?
Duncan apparently said he was tired.
He went to sleep.
He never woke.
We're gonna have to search his whole quarters.
Top to bottom.
Shh.
Hold on.
What is it, DiNozzo?
Do you hear that?
Something...
Is it coming from the walls?
It's like a scra...
It's over here.
What is that?
Oh, boy.
Oh!
Hey, look out!
Look out.
There it is.
Get it.
Where is it?
Here... here it goes.
Well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.
Can I go home now?
How can something so small be so dangerous?
Actually, Agent Brody, he's innocent.
And totally healthy.
Blood work came back negative.
No plague at all?
That's right.
No sign of bacterial infection.
Well, if it wasn't a rat, what else could it be?
Uh-oh.
What's uh-oh?
I don't like "uh-oh."
Skin samples from both Lieutenant Collier and the ensign appear to be the same.
Both men were infected by the same strain of plague.
That's not exactly a surprise.
Yeah, but the purity of the strain is.
Guys, this is a version of the plague that couldn't have come from a flea or a cute little rat.
This abomination didn't occur naturally.
It happened in a lab.
It's a synthesized and manufactured bacteria.
So neither of our victims were infected by accident.
This ship was targeted, as in military terrorism.
And by sending them out on liberty...
Our own sailors become weapons of mass destruction.
I've been calling your cell.
You're not answering.
Left my phone on my desk.
Sorry.
You want some coffee?
There's... a fresh pot.
The beans are from Spitfire.
You're clearly not planning on getting any sleep.
Too much on my mind.
Didn't sleep in 2005.
No point trying now.
Two dead.
How many more...
infected?
How much can the... city take?
How much more can the city handle?
Dwayne Cassius Pride, you listen to me.
You want to see strength?
You ain't seen nothin' yet.
I'll get the coffee.
Only a handful of laboratories in the world have access to a strain this powerful.
The question is, which one did it come from?
I know the bubonic and this offspring are crazy potent.
Don't you just love her?
We know for sure that... the Geronimo was circling South America, right?
In Chincha, Peru, it's common to eat cat.
Cats can carry Toxoplasma that can cause toxoplasmosis.
Okay, okay, okay.
True but gross.
And why?
Well, toxoplasmosis just happens to be one of the many diseases
Navy Medical Research Unit 6 studies in their lab at Lima.
Including plague.
Number Six is like the Fort Knox of bad germs.
It's like the world's most secure petri dish.
Yeah, and no one on the ship had any business being there.
How did it get on board?
I mean, it didn't just hitch a ride.
Or did it?
The evidence that Agent Pride brought in-- what did the victims have in their trash cans?
Well, there was some dental floss, gum wrappers, one questionable magazine.
Someone left some chewing tobacco gnawed up in a big ball.
That's nasty.
And there were muffin wrappers in both.
One blueberry and one... bran.
Uh-huh.
Now prove they were tampered with.
Yeah, running them.
Looks like both foil wrappers had tiny needle punctures in the outer paper.
Yeah, and I'm picking up a high concentration of Yersinia pestis in the remaining crumbs.
They must have come from the ship's galley or ward room.
Okay, so connect baked goods to darkest Peru.
Sebastian, you're a genius.
Namru Six in Lima had a security breach two weeks ago.
They kept it on the down low, but someone entered the live contagion unit.
Muffins?
Bad ones.
Filled with the plague.
Where'd they come from?
The galley.
It says in the manifest
Culinary Specialist,
Second Class Petty Officer Linus Warren signed for supplies in port in Lima.
Who is he?
Petty Officer Warren.
One of the three sailors still missing.
Linus is up to his eyeballs in debt.
Headed for bankruptcy.
That's motive.
Yeah, but he's got a history of charity work.
He volunteers all over the world, including a place in Central City the last time he was here.
Café Reconcile.
Read about it in one of my books.
It was started years ago as a youth support center.
Call them.
Find out if he's there.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hands in the air!
Don't move!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
NCIS!
Hands up!
Turn around!
Petty Officer Linus Warren, we've been looking for you.
Why?
What did I do?
I was on liberty;
I didn't do anything wrong, I swear!
What happened to these guys?
They're dead.
Bubonic plague, not pretty.
You a baker, Linus?
Yes, sir, that's what I do.
Hm, and I'm sure you not answering a dozen calls from your XO,
NCIS and Navy HQ is just a coincidence.
My phone broke.
I was planning on being back at the ship when liberty ended.
People are dying,
Petty Officer Warren, and we think you're responsible.
We think you poisoned them.
How?
Namru Six ring a bell?
Nam...
I don't know what you're talking about!
I didn't kill anybody.
I just bake.
I needed to chill and unwind.
I called some friends at the café here in town, and they said to come on over.
This is messed up, man.
This is crazy.
I couldn't kill anybody.
You just bake.
Yes, sir, I just bake.
What do you mean, it came from the mess?
Muffins, to be exact, Commander.
And somebody had to get to them.
And you think one of my crew did this?
Somebody from my ship?
It had to be somebody on board.
You tell me.
Agent Pride, I don't understand what you're asking.
Did anybody else board the Geronimo, Commander?
No.
All crew and passengers aboard were registered in the manifest.
Then forgive my redundancy, but... could you please run me through things one more time?
As we discussed, the ship stopped in Lima to refuel and get supplies.
And no crew left the pier?
No one.
But there was an adjustment.
There was an adjustment to the ship's medical team.
Dr. Hufcutt?
You offer rides to civilians sometimes?
He transferred via helo.
While we were already at sea, not in port.
But close enough, Commander.
Can you tell me where I might find the doctor?
Well, if he's not at the crisis center, he lives in Baton Rouge.
That's where his pharmaceutical company is based.
You don't think...
I don't think, ma'am.
I know.
Give me something.
Dr. Mitchell Hufcutt, founder of Hufcutt Pharmaceuticals.
The company smartly made alliances with the military, providing combat meds to field hospitals for the past few years.
His reputation alone gave him access to the labs in Lima.
How's business now?
Terrible.
Several bad investments have him on the verge of collapse.
Is that a big ol' motive I hear around the corner?
Hufcutt takes advantage of the navy to steal and create a plague he can vaccinate against.
Like the bird flu scare a few years ago.
He'd make hundreds of millions on the antibiotics alone.
He manufactured the vaccine, too.
Doesn't sound like a coincidence to me.
So where is he now?
No one knows.
We called his home, his office.
He's vanished, fell off the grid.
All right, track everything, credit cards, cell phones.
I want to know when he unzips his fly in the men's bathroom.
Find the son of a bitch.
Where you going?
Need to see a doctor, stat.
Look, I'm sorry, Agent Pride, but I don't know.
I came home to take a shower.
The last two days have been difficult, to say the least.
I need to get back to the crisis center.
I don't doubt that, Dr. Haley, I just...
You and I have been through plenty over the years.
I just need to know if there's anything you talked with Dr. Hufcutt about.
He mentioned he had an important event to go to in Jackson.
A convention of some kind.
Something he said we actually relevant to our dire situation.
What kind of convention?
I assume something medical.
There's a gathering of physicians from all over the world happening.
I suppose it's possible.
But why now?
Why when he's needed so badly here?
Germs travel, Doctor.
Bigger crisis means more vaccine.
More medicine means more money.
Tell me about the convention in Jackson.
An organization called Doctors International Outreach.
Doctors from around the globe get together and share cases.
And then they go home.
Infected and carrying a bacteria Hufcutt's company can medicate.
Treating thousands of victims.
The doctor's going global.
And the clue trail is next to impossible to track.
Not if we can stop him.
Dr. Hufcutt just turned his cell phone on for a minute.
I got him.
Can you track it?
I can do one better.
I can run his ass off the road.
NCIS.
Where the hell do you think you're going, Doctor?
Hey, what are you doing?
!
Huh?
I didn't do anything.
Let me go.
Dr. Mitchell Hufcutt, you are under arrest for murder and domestic terrorism.
What?
Where's the bacteria you stole?
And be careful what you say, because I might just ram it right down your pathetic little throat.
I don't know what you're talking about.
This is crazy!
Let me go!
Wait...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, you can't do this.
Hey, whoa, whoa.
Stop!
I can't swim!
No!
No!
Please.
Please don't do this.
I made a mistake.
The bacteria's safe;
it's in the car.
Aah!
King.
Please.
This place is kind of beautiful.
I'm getting some serious reading done.
Well, I'm getting some bites.
A lot to be grateful for.
People are healthy, bacteria's contained.
Catfish don't know I'm using my secret weapon.
What is it?
Moldy cheese and fatback.
And you expect me to eat what you catch?
If you don't, I will.
Come on, baby.
Come on.
You know you want it.
Take it.
Come on, baby.
Come to Daddy.
Come on now.
I'm right here waiting for you.
Is he really talking to that fish like he's Barry White?
Come on.
Called foreplay, Brody.
Every good fisherman knows how to tease with the best of them.
This is Pride.
One marine's been shot?
Call the morgue.
We'll reach out to the family.
This is an NCIS case now.
And we're back to work.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
This is the toughest decision that we've made so far.
...as two big names...
Christian.
Cutter.
... exited the MasterChef kitchen.
Tonight, it's a two-hour MasterChef with the ultimate culinary title at stake.
The three best home cooks in America take on the season's most intimidating challenge.
50 chefs representing 50 states.
Wow.
But only two will make the finale.
The pressure is on.
- I loved it.
- I'd put that on my menu.
And the world's biggest cooking competition comes to an end...
Absolutely spot on.
- It's a knockout.
- It leaves me wanting more.
... as this season five MasterChef is crowned.
America's next MasterChef is...
Welcome.
Oh, my god.
I'm in the semifinals.
This time last year I was cooking in my teeny little electric stove kitchen in Philadelphia with my cat, and now this is my chance to shine.
Courtney, Leslie, and Elizabeth, congratulations.
- Thank you, chef.
- Thank you.
You are the final three in the biggest culinary competition in the world.
This is the semifinal, so as well as winning $1/4 million and your very own cookbook, one of you is only a few dishes away from winning this...
The coveted MasterChef trophy.
I did a wonderful job taking care of my wife and my children.
My goal now is to do something for me.
That trophy will change my life forever.
For me, that trophy is my ticket to publish my own cookbook, which I've been dreaming of for years.
For this challenge, we want you to cook a special dish for some very special guests.
Each and every one of those guests is perfectly placed to judge your food because each of tonight's guests are all... chefs.
- What?
- Oy.
We have one amazing professional chef from each and every state in this country... 50 chefs.
Tonight, you have to serve them in the MasterChef restaurant a composed MasterChef-worthy entree.
But prepping and cooking for 50 chefs...
Come on, it's impossible for you to do it alone.
So tonight we've brought you some help.
Ohh.
I see Willie, Daniel,
Ahran, Victoria, Christian, and Jaimee to boot.
I was down in a pressure test with every one of them.
You counted me out.
The old man's still standing.
It's wonderful being back.
Getting the call to come back is totally, like, awesome.
With your future and fortune at stake, there's only really one fair way to decide who you will be working with...
Fortune cookies.
You'll each randomly take two fortune cookies, and whichever name is inside that fortune cookie will be your sous chefs tonight.
Please, all three of you, come up and take two cookies each.
Courtney, please open one of those cookies and tell us who you have.
- Daniel.
- Good job.
- Stand next to Courtney.
- Thank you.
Hey.
Leslie.
I got what I wished for, Ahran.
- Ahran.
- Wow.
Nice!
For some reason, I knew this was gonna happen.
like, something about my fate is always in Leslie's hands.
Elizabeth, please open up one of those fortune cookies.
Jaimee.
- Oh.
- Wow.
- Wow.
- Wow.
Courtney, please open your final fortune cookie.
Big Willie.
Big Willie, wow.
Leslie.
All my dreams come true.
Christian.
Wow.
I know a chef when I see one.
How you doing, brother?
Elizabeth, you have Victoria.
Yeah, what's up, yo?
Hell yeah.
Get over here.
What are the odds?
Now we want restaurant quality, elevated entrees good enough to be eaten by the best chefs in the country.
You will have just 90 minutes to conceive, prep, and plate your stunning dishes.
You are one step away from the finale.
It's all on the line tonight.
Your 90 minutes starts...
Now.
Christian, let's go down here.
There's gonna be 50 chefs from all over the country in the dining room critiquing our food.
I mean, that's crazy.
I'm doing a prime fillet.
I'm gonna make an herb gnocchi.
Lots of butter.
If you can just get the fish out,
I'll meet you over there.
It's a dream come true, but it's also terrifying to cook for that many amazing chefs.
We're gonna make a skin-on pan-seared red snapper fillets with cauliflower three ways and a really awesome Mediterranean relish.
Daniel, have you seen lemon grass yet?
If we think it's hard getting anything past
Chef Ramsay, chef Elliot, and Joe, it's gonna be 50 times harder getting it past all of these chefs.
We're doing a ginger soy-glazed halibut with a beet dashi, golden beets.
Also doing a chile sauce.
- Get to it.
- Okay.
Let's do this.
I think that's it.
Let's go.
Wow, wow, wow.
4 1/2 cups of hot water.
- I need a bigger...
- Bigger pot?
I'll go get it.
You need the Japanese turner so you can start this?
- He's got it right there.
- Okay.
This is it.
What a big night.
I mean, it's as much pressure tonight as there is in the final.
50 chefs in your dining room?
Come on.
Even for a professional chef, it's a big ask.
No, not there yet.
So Courtney picked halibut with kind of an Asian twist.
If there's one thing chefs hate in the best of times, it's overcooked fish.
Yeah, literally, this fish hangs around
- two minutes longer...
- It's like powder.
- Yeah, it goes to mush.
- Mm-hmm.
Elizabeth's dish, she's doing cauliflower.
It's a glazed pan-seared red snapper.
Very seasonal.
It's a dish that caught my attention.
Leslie picked meat.
He's going with a fillet with gnocchi.
I didn't know why he's put those two together.
- What are your herbs for?
- Herb gnocchi.
I think he's looking at the fillet as being a star and then trying to come up with a creative side.
- All right, chives, done.
- Thank you.
This is just the wrong one.
30 minutes gone.
You've now got one hour remaining.
Get organized.
Two minutes from now the chefs are arriving.
- Let's get all of this.
- No, this is more than enough.
Come on, guys, speed up, please.
The chefs are arriving.
Please welcome tonight's judges, some of the greatest chefs in America.
From Mississippi, Cat Cora.
- Oh, my god.
- Oh.
From Maryland, Michael Voltaggio.
From Ohio, Susan Feniger.
From Michigan, Duff Goldman.
Arizona, Suzanne Tracht.
It's like a never-ending parade of famous people that I'm obsessed with.
Representing California, Jet Tila.
Illinois, Mary Sue Milliken.
Oh, my god!
From Nevada, Herb Wilson.
This is absurd.
From Missouri, Anthony Carron.
John Sedlar from New Mexico.
Casey Lane from Texas.
Tom Shields from West Virginia.
This is huge.
We're having some of the best chefs in America sitting down waiting to taste our food.
If I don't bring my "a" game today, man,
I'm gonna be in trouble.
The pressure is on.
Please welcome tonight's judges, some of the greatest chefs in America.
Wow!
It's so incredible.
We are serving 50 chefs from 50 different states.
It's like all of the cookbooks I've been studying from came to life and just walked into the kitchen right by me.
This is amazing.
Seeing my idols walk in...
oh, my god.
Time to step my game up.
It's like, these people don't even know I, like, worship them, and I'm about to cook for them.
It's amazing.
I just took a picture of you taking a picture.
- It's pretty awesome.
- Very exciting.
Okay, guys, just over 50 minutes until service begins.
- Courtney.
- Yes, chef?
Wake up, now, yeah?
Describe the dish.
I'm doing Asian ginger soy-glazed halibut with a beet dashi vermicelli.
Quite modern, very vibrant.
Why halibut?
Halibut has a really nice, white, flaky meat that will complement my sweet sauce.
- Overcooks easily.
- I know that.
- It'll be very unforgiving.
- Yep.
And even when I get two chefs in my restaurants, you know, it's a big deal.
I've never had 50 chefs.
How're you feeling?
The pressure is definitely on, but I'm feeling very confident because I've prepared well, and I know that with good preparation comes good execution.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
Three, baby, only three.
We don't want to crowd you too much.
Here, take a bite.
Whoa, that's awesome.
So what's the dish, Elizabeth?
Tell me.
This is a Mediterranean skin-on red snapper with a watercress puree, a pistachio puree, and cauliflower three ways.
It sounds very contemporary, sounds very restaurant-y.
Is that what you're going for?
Absolutely.
Out of the three of us,
I have the most restaurant-y, chef-y dish, and I think that's the perfect audience for what I'm cooking.
But is it a good strategy to propose such a chef-y dish to 50 chefs?
- Yeah.
- Good luck.
- Leslie.
- Yes, sir.
Tell me what the dish is.
It's an 8-ounce fillet with summer vegetables, herb gnocchi with mushrooms and a demi-glace red wine sauce.
I've never in my life seen fillet and gnocchi mixed together though.
Listen, you told me to reach for the stars.
I'm reaching for the stars.
I'm throwing something down.
- It's very tasty.
- Thank you.
Looks beautiful.
25 minutes remaining.
Let's go.
I'm so excited to have these 50 chefs here.
- It's amazing.
- Amazing.
These chefs will decide who wins this challenge and goes straight to the finale of MasterChef.
To you.
I hope that the home cooks do us proud.
Elizabeth's team is amazing, very harmonious.
She's controlling it.
She's dictating the terms, and they are listening.
Jaimee, test that cauliflower for me.
It's really kind of impressive to watch.
Wow.
I turned off the burners.
They're definitely cooked.
Okay.
Daniel, can you get me a fish spatula?
Thank you.
Courtney's on the other hand, halibut...
You don't really start recommending halibut for a large contingent, especially chefs.
It's not the fish you'd give them, is it?
No, there's no fat in it.
It goes dry right away.
And then to do it in an Asian style for the first time ever in this competition...
One more minute.
I think she's playing without a net.
Get the vegetables squared away.
I need the mushrooms cut too.
Leslie is so confident about this dish.
They got to be almost stiff.
Taste them.
- Stiff?
- You got it.
This is gonna be incredible.
Taste, taste, taste.
You want a nice texture.
He's just in the driver's seat right now.
They're soft enough for me.
- Way too hard.
Way too hard.
- Incredible.
Gnocchi's done.
What can I do for you?
- Set plates up.
- Yeah?
If I had to hire one of these three home cooks as a chef in my restaurant today,
- it would be Leslie.
- Wow.
- He's on fire.
- Wow.
Watch it.
Ah...
Careful, careful, careful.
Come on, Leslie.
Watch out, man.
Take it off.
Take your foot off.
Take your foot off.
Take your foot off.
I've got it, Leslie.
I've got it.
Damn, damn, damn.
Sorry.
When it rains, it pours.
15 minutes remaining.
Got to start clearing down.
Get organized, lay out the plates.
Count the plates.
Let's go.
Letting down my culinary idols would be unthinkable,
So plating is more critical than ever.
So just a little spoonful right in the middle.
let it kind of fall as it will.
Because you are serving it to people who look at every dish with the eyes of a chef.
Beautiful, Ahran, beautiful.
- All right, let's whack it.
- Whack it.
Couple more gnocchi on this plate.
You got it.
Thank you.
Leslie's plating, Elizabeth's plating.
Sauce at the end here.
I got the sauce.
Courtney's got nothing on the plate, bar her name.
Still the same game plan with the plating?
- Daniel.
- Yes, chef?
Is anyone gonna start plating?
- I'm getting directions.
- Yes, sir, getting directions.
But is anybody gonna start plating?
The noodles are ready.
You want them start going...
- Courtney!
- Yes, chef.
Is anybody gonna start plating?
I'm telling him to start plating right now.
We need to step up a gear, guys.
We're going right now.
Guys, don't forget, in the restaurant we have a chef from every state in America.
Let's go, guys.
Come on.
All of you, speed up.
Courtney's got no plates dressed.
We got 12 minutes to go.
All I need to hear is what goes in the vermicelli.
I keep telling you it's all of the noodles and the sauce.
Here, you do it yourself.
Willie and Daniel, do you have any idea what's going on?
That's what I'm trying to get details on, chef.
I've said it more than enough times.
- Say it again.
- So let's do that right now.
- Oh, my god.
- Make it happen.
Make it happen.
- I did what you told me to do.
- Okay.
Eight minutes to go.
- Do it.
- You don't wanna toss it in the broth?
Get going.
No, just get going.
- Put the noodles down.
- Come on.
We got to get it on the plate, okay?
We've got to get it on the plate.
Okay, keep it cool.
This is my worst nightmare coming to life.
Finish all of them.
Oh, my goodness, me.
This is insane.
Eight minutes to go.
With time running out in tonight's semifinal challenge, the final three home cooks must conceive and cook a restaurant-quality dish for 50 of the biggest culinary names in the country.
We're looking for flavor.
We're looking for presentation.
This is MasterChef, and althou ty're home cooks,
I'm looking for raw talent.
I'm expecting culinary magic, and I came here hungry.
Last two minutes.
Make it happen.
Make it happen.
- I did what you told me to do.
- Okay.
This is insane.
You don't wanna toss it in the broth?
- Do it and get going.
- No, just get going.
- Put the noodles down.
- Come on.
We gotta get it on the plate, okay?
- Don't start yelling now.
- We got to get it on the plate.
Okay, keep it cool.
My name is on the plate.
It doesn't say "Daniel" or "Big Willie."
It says "Courtney."
Sauce.
There's no sauce on that one.
We got to do sauces.
Willie, get the... the red sauce is right in front of you.
Turn around.
There's no fish on this one.
And I'm not okay with how they look.
This looks like crap.
45 seconds to go.
All right, let's push it out.
Looking good, you all.
Let's go, guys.
Come on!
Ooh, watch out, watch out.
Ten, nine, eight...
- Let's go!
- Seven, six...
Come on!
- Five...
- Come on, you guys.
Four, three, two, one.
And stop.
Hands in the air.
Here come the servers.
Really careful, guys, 'cause they're stacked pretty tall.
Gentle, like a lover.
Gently.
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.
The fillet came out beautifully.
The gnocchi looks great.
Everything looks perfect.
Courtney, Leslie, and Elizabeth,
Please say good-bye and thank you to your sous chefs.
Bye, you guys.
- I'm so sorry for...
- It's okay, honey.
- Bye.
- See you soon.
Love you.
Bye, you guys.
Having my dream team by my side was amazing, but at the end of the day, this is my plate.
I own it.
I'm proud of it, and I'm hyper-confident.
Okay, Elizabeth,
Leslie, and Courtney,
I'd like all three of you to come with us into the MasterChef restaurant and explain to our 50 chefs from 50 states what you've cooked for them tonight.
Let's go.
As an aerial dancer,
I've been on a stage in front of huge audiences for most of my life, and I'm starting to feel scared right now.
Ladies and gents, chefs, first of all a great honor it is to have you all here.
First ever in the history of this competition that we can get such an elaborate array of talent in one room.
Courtney, describe your dish please.
Tonight I have prepared for you a pan-seared halibut that I've glazed with ginger and soy.
Beneath that is a beet dashi vermicelli and surrounding the plate is a guero chile sauce.
Looks good.
- Thank you.
- Leslie, please.
My plate tonight is a 8-ounce fillet that was pan roasted with a herb gnocchi, and some summer vegetables, and a wine reduction.
Elizabeth, please.
I've made for you a pan-seared skin-on red snapper with cauliflower three ways, harissa-roasted white cauliflower puree, and a purple cauliflower couscous, and a little pistachio puree.
Great.
Courtney, Leslie, Elizabeth, please head back in to the MasterChef kitchen while these amazing chefs taste your dishes.
Please, look at the dishes.
Break it down.
Reward creativity, flare, imagination, and of course, obviously, it's about the taste.
Enjoy, and a big thank you again for making the effort to be here.
Oh, my god, I want to know what they're saying in there.
Ugh.
They're probably loving the idea of your cauliflower couscous.
Being a seafood chef, my first and foremost is gonna be the fish, but she's also taken that same attention to the vegetables.
She really did do cauliflower three ways.
She's got three different textures, three different preparations, three different colors, three different flavors.
Every single component works separately, and it works together.
Could use a little bit of seasoning, but you can taste the cauliflower.
So you kind of went, like, an Asian flavor profile.
That's interesting.
Yeah, the judges kept saying to me,
"What haven't you shown us?"
So I was like, "I'll show you Asian."
Courtney did a good job cooking the fish.
- The halibut's cooked nice.
- Mm-hmm.
I do like this flavor of the broth on the noodles.
Very sophisticated.
You could have this in an upscale restaurant.
She knocked it out of the park with that dish.
It could use more sauce.
When I heard you were doing gnocchi for that many people I was like,
"This man has gone insane."
Mine seemed fine.
Everything, the gnocchi held up.
It was tough though.
Although steak is safe, gnocchi's not safe.
It's a gamble to try to cook a gnocchi for not just chefs, but for anybody.
Flavor-wise, it's delicious.
It's seasoned.
The meat is cooked perfectly.
This would be a dish I'd order in a restaurant, like, beef and mushrooms and red wine, classic combination.
There were, like, good elements, but it's kind of...
it's a little disjointed.
I have to say, this is my choice right here.
Yeah, I would agree.
I-I definitely think Elizabeth stole the show, yeah.
I'd sell this dish in my restaurant.
I'm gonna go with Leslie.
Things are cliches for a reason.
Is it culinary genius?
Maybe not.
I loved it.
Courtney...
look how beautiful this is.
Look at that.
Perfect.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Perfect.
Wow.
When I walk in and I see the chorus line of amazing chefs, they are going to send someone right into the finale.
The home cook that we'd like to invite down here...
My dish should beat Leslie and Elizabeth's because it's original.
It's showing chef-like qualities.
The individual with the dish of the night...
I need to win.
I need to get up on that balcony and be number one, or otherwise I don't know.
Another pressure test, number seven?
I mean, come on, really?
Congratulations goes to...
Wow.
The individual with the dish of the night,
Congratulations goes to...
Elizabeth.
Amazing.
I am so happy.
I get to walk through the hallway of chefs.
I'm in the finale, and I am thrilled beyond words.
Well done.
Please, head up to the balcony.
There's a very cool glass of champagne waiting for you.
Great job.
Leslie and Courtney, please make your way down.
On behalf of everybody here at MasterChef,
I'd like to say a big special thank you to our talented chefs standing behind you.
Much appreciated.
Hope to see you again.
Thank you.
So now it's between me and Courtney.
I am psyched about this.
I'm not gonna let anything get in my way, and I'm gonna get this thing done.
All right, Courtney and Leslie, well done.
Tough challenge tonight.
Unfortunately, not in the same league as Elizabeth.
Now both of you will perhaps the most grueling and the most important pressure test you've ever done in this competition, where only one of you will join Elizabeth in the grand final of MasterChef.
Next time we see you, it's gonna be intense.
There have been seven other people who have tried to send Leslie home in the pressure test, and they've failed.
This is my chance to send him back to Malibu.
Today I'm going into the biggest battle of my life.
I can do this.
I can make this happen.
I will be in the finale.
Welcome.
Good to see you both.
Come on down, please.
Elizabeth is the first person to be catapulted into the MasterChef finale.
The task now is to find out which one of you two will be facing Elizabeth.
In a previous challenge, we had you make an incredibly complex composed entree.
Now it's time for dessert, but not just any dessert.
Three desserts that celebrate the greatness of America, the united cakes of America.
First up, you have something that I am very familiar with, a proud staple of my hometown...
New York cheesecake.
Ooh.
Tangy, rich, cheese filling.
Nestled in a crisp graham cracker crust, topped with a beautiful strawberry coulis.
Next up...
From the great state of Florida, we have key lime pie.
Tangy, smooth, bursting with fresh flavor, and it's all about balance,
Sweet versus tart.
Next up, you have another great American regional dessert.
From the great state of Massachusetts, you have a delicious Boston cream pie.
Two gorgeous layers of sponge with a phenomenal cream filling between them, and then the whole thing is covered in a stunning chocolate ganache.
This is a tall order for anybody, and for someone who doesn't bake, this is a nightmare.
Courtney, Leslie, any last words for each other?
If she wins fair and square, fine with me, but I'm not going down sleeping, that for damn sure.
Now it's time to head to your stations.
You have two hours to make us all three incredibly challenging desserts from different parts of this great country.
You all have everything that you need to make these three difficult desserts.
Bake better than you've ever baked before, because if you don't, it will be the last time you'll be making anything here in the MasterChef kitchen.
Your time starts...
Now.
So Leslie's seventh pressure test tonight.
Wouldn't that freak you out if you were Courtney?
We've always known she's a baker, so she got the luck of the draw.
Yeah, but, I mean, Leslie's excelled too, so it's not like one-sided, like she was given an advantage with this.
No, but tonight's all about nerves of steel.
One mistake, and they're out.
You have to cook with composure.
I'm freaking losing time right now.
I'm gonna beat Leslie because I've been baking cakes forever.
I love baking cakes.
This is one of my favorite things to do.
I can see myself in the finale already.
Months ago, it would take them two hours to do one cake.
Tonight, we're asking them to do all three in two hours.
What cake has to go first?
Get that cheesecake in the oven immediately because you haven't got time.
It's the longest cook time?
- It's an hour to cook.
- An hour?
An hour to cook.
and then cool.
I got to get moving, man.
After that, start tackling the Boston cream pie
- 'cause that sponge...
- got to bake the sponge.
Oh, man, that is a difficult one.
Then from there, start on the easiest one I think, which is the key lime.
Right, you have to have that lime zest and you want that acidity to come through.
But the cheesecake is the big one that needs to go in the oven within the first 20 minutes.
- Oh!
- Sorry.
25 minutes gone.
95 minutes to go.
Just keep this going, Courtney.
Keep it going.
Right, Courtney, how are you feeling?
Oh, I'm feeling incredible.
Cheesecake's in?
Cheesecake is in, chef.
Now, you look composed.
You look together.
Can you do this?
Absolutely.
I can totally do this.
This is what I love to do.
I've never seen anyone so happy in a pressure test.
- I know.
- Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm great.
I'm not just a girl wearing high heels.
I'm a girl that can cook.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
Spoons, spoons, spoons, spoons, spoons.
Gorgeous.
Let's keep this going.
I notice Courtney talking herself through the challenge.
You got to fold it gently.
Yes.
She's like, "It looks beautiful.
Now I just have to put the cream of tartar in."
Beautiful.
Yes.
"Yes, it looks beautiful."
Leslie talks to himself too, but he's like,
Hey, what do I gotta put the...
Eh, I got the cream of tartar, and I got the...the...
gotta whip the lemon meringue."
Mmm.
It's like you feel, like, seven separate voices talking to him in his own head.
Shh-shh-shh.
Leslie, how we doing?
- Not doing so good.
Not doing so good.
- What's wrong?
No, not doing so good, man.
- This is not my strength, man.
- Look, I know.
You just gotta slow down, take a breath.
which cake is that?
This is the cheesecake.
Courtney's cheesecake is cooked already.
Yeah, because she's...
she's a baker, you know?
She's done.
It's cooked.
Yes, I understand.
You want to know what?
Why are you so far behind?
'Cause I don't do this.
This is not my forte.
The timing of the cheesecake leaves you no net.
No.
No net whatsoever.
And it might not even cool down in time.
I am so frazzled.
I got too many things going through my head.
Got to get this thing in the oven or otherwise I'm gonna be screwed.
Unless there's a miracle, this cheesecake is not gonna cook.
The party might be over.
Still to come tonight...
It's the MasterChef finale.
But which of these home cooks will battle Elizabeth for the MasterChef title?
America's next MasterChef is...
Which cake is that?
This is the cheesecake.
This is not my forte.
This is not one of my strengths.
It does set you behind a little bit.
Yes, it does.
Do you have any progress on the other cakes, here you just been doing this?
Yes, I do.
No, I just gotta get...
- I got to get it first.
- Slow down, slow down, slow down.
You got to relax a little bit.
No, I can't.
You know, I'm always on the verge of a nervous breakdown, but I'm not going there.
Lady, who's your daddy?
Leslie is a bit all over the place.
He just put the cheesecake in.
We're not even sure if there's enough time to cool it down.
Leslie has fallen behind on the cheesecake.
He may be trying to make up for the other two.
So key lime pie is the simplest, but also really there's a balancing act between sweet and sour.
How do you manage that?
If it's too acidic, then you add more sugar.
If it's too sweet, then y you need to add a little bit more citrus.
So you've got to find that balance.
The Boston cream pie is a difficult one.
The secret in the sponge is the aeration, incorporating those eggs and the butter and the sugar.
What's a perfect Boston cream?
That is the base of a great pastry cream, but again, too heavy in that, they can split the sponge.
Leslie's pulling his cheesecake out.
But the big question tonight is:
is Leslie's New York cheesecake
- cooked?
- Right.
30 minutes remaining.
Let's go.
Okay, I need to get my cheesecake, and I can finish the cheesecake, and everything will all be good in the world.
Time's a ticking.
I'm taking a licking, but guess what.
These are done, so I'm happy about that.
Oh, my cheesecake is gorgeous.
Courtney, how we doing?
I'm doing so good.
How does it feel to be in here now?
I mean, the semifinal?
This is how I want to do this, this is how I want to enter the finale.
This is just me versus Leslie in the kitchen.
This is how I want to win it.
Awesome.
Good luck.
Thank you, chef Elliot.
Look at Leslie go.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
That looks good.
Oh, he's gonna drop it if he's not careful.
Palette knife.
Palette knife, Leslie.
It will fall off.
It'll slide off.
So tarts are both done.
Cheesecakes are both done.
Now it comes down to the Boston cream pie.
Courtney's just taken her sponge out.
But you can see Leslie right now.
He had these nice, beautiful ones.
It's not gonna be from a lack of trying, that's for freaking damn sure.
You can start to see the stress on Courtney's face.
Yeah.
It's really low right there.
Winning this pressure test is your ticket right to the finale, and Leslie probably has the upper hand just by virtue of the fact that he's been through so many pressure tests.
I mean, it's like his second job at this point, and he seems to be coming back.
Gentle, baby, gentle.
Gentle, gentle, gentle.
Less than 15 minutes to go.
Now is gonna be the most exciting, 'cause that's when they have to start assembling them.
And you just visually will know whether you're going home or going to join Elizabeth in the finale.
Leslie's about to start filling his Boston cream pie.
looks good.
Wow.
Yeah, pastry cream looks nice.
Oh, my god.
- That looks amazing.
- Oh, no.
Oh, my gosh, she's putting it in directly.
Just got to do it like this.
Oh, no.
Courtney's cakes look a little uneven.
Like, her pastry cream is oozing out from the middle.
Right now, Courtney is completely falling apart.
Last five minutes.
Son of a bitch.
He's a mad man.
Last minute, guys.
finishing touches, please.
Come on, place in the final for one of you.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
And stop.
Hands in the air.
Good job.
Courtney's cheesecake looks like you googled the perfect cheesecake.
It is completely flawless.
So the knife is going through very nicely.
It's nice and smooth.
Okay, here we go.
How does that look?
I think it looks delicious.
The crust is crispy.
The cream cheese cake itself is light, airy, rich, smooth.
- Very good.
- Thank you.
- Okay, Leslie.
- Yes.
Less aesthetically appealing, but, as we say, it's all about the taste.
Ooh.
Yes, it looks a little...
See, that looks super creamy, super, like...
- Yes, right there.
- Raw.
Let's taste it though.
The graham cracker crust is a little...is burnt.
Tastes like burnt chocolate chips cookies.
You know that flavor?
Yeah, yeah.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
Given the circumstances,
I would say you both did a pretty good job with those cheesecakes.
Thank you.
One looked much more like the cake we were asking for and tasted closer to what we were expecting.
The best cheesecake tonight belongs to...
Courtney.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Courtney, what do you think?
I was a little overexcited with the blow torch.
Yeah, looks like key lime s'mores.
- It's very sweet.
- Okay.
You know, with key lime pie,
I love that sharp...
Tartness.
Acidic tang coming through, and this is...
it's almost obliterated.
The only lime I'm really getting is from the zest over the top.
Okay.
All right, so, Leslie, anything I should know about this?
Uh, no, this one I kind of, uh, hit it on the mark.
The flavor's awesome.
It's got that zing to it.
The curd baked perfectly, great texture.
You nailed it.
Great job.
Thank you, chef.
Key lime pie, with everything, it comes down to the details.
The winning key lime pie belongs to...
Leslie.
Great job on that key lime pie.
Thank you, chef.
I definitely won the key lime.
Now we got to go to the Boston cream.
Whoever wins this is going into the finale.
I'm watching this pastry cream ooze out the sides, and I'm just seeing myself walking out of the MasterChef doors.
So it comes down to the Boston cream pie.
Courtney.
Courtney, Courtney, Courtney.
I know.
I'll just have a little look at that.
Mine's quite even on the top, at least...
I'm not talking about the unevenness.
I'm talking about the slurry and the sludge
That's oozing out of yours.
That should be stuck together.
Thank you.
- Uh, Leslie.
- Yes, chef.
Lovely ratio.
Sponge slightly too thick, but nice density of pastry cream inside.
Wow.
Thank you.
Please, Courtney, Leslie, come around to the front, thank you.
We now have to work out which one of you moves on to the MasterChef grand finale.
Please, give us a minute.
Thank you.
- Courtney is a mess.
- Yeah.
There's no creamn the, is there?
Boston cream pie is about the cream.
Yeah, it's like a liquid center cake.
Leslie's had a great pastry cream.
There's something really weird tasting at the bottom.
It's like a weird bread.
He needed a little more sugar or something?
Yeah, I think that probably is what's wrong with it.
- Something major.
- Mm-hmm.
It all comes down to the Boston cream pie, and it seems like Leslie's has the edge.
All right, Courtney,
You had highs and lows, insufficient pastry cream, pastry cream slightly liquid, top heavy, it terms of, good ganache, lovely sponge.
Leslie, visually incredible, great pastry cream, ganache delicious, but something very odd came to mind whilst tasting the sponge.
Why don't you just have a taste of that, please.
Do you know what's wrong with that sponge?
You put the salt in place of the sugar.
I may have, yes.
The home cook who made the best Boston cream pie and the person who will now move into the MasterChef finale and face-off against Elizabeth, that person is...
Courtney.
Oh, my god.
Congratulations.
You did an amazing job.
I tried.
I made a simple mistake.
Not a problem.
Thank god.
I was certain that I was going home.
Wow.
I feel bad for Leslie.
It was such an honest mistake.
Seven pressure tests.
Finally one got you.
Yeah, and you know what?
I figured my luck kind of ran out after six, but she just happened to knock me off my pedestal.
Everyone in America who's ever baked more than one cake, including myself, has made the same exact mistake that you made tonight.
Leslie, you have been phenomenal.
And for anybody out there that ever tells me again that cooking is a young man's game, you've turned that around on its head.
Thank you, chef.
Come and say good-bye, big man.
Thank you very much.
It was a pleasure meeting you guys.
You guys are my idols.
Right, two talented individuals.
Who is your money on?
I'm sorry, Courtney, but I would definitely put my money on Elizabeth.
Thank you, Leslie.
- Thank you again, chef.
- Well done.
All right.
I'm the stay-at-home dad that came here to win, and I was doing a pretty damn good job up until the salt part.
This is a great looking pie.
You really nailed it.
Awesome dish.
You're up at the top right now.
All of you, right now, get your ass down here quickly.
That's what I call a box of donuts.
Wow.
I learned a lot.
I mean, I didn't expect to make it this far.
I met interesting people.
Some liked me.
Some didn't like me.
I can hear you.
I don't need to look at you.
I need you to look at me!
You're not sorry at all!
I did not expect to work out my differences with this young lady.
Not only are you becoming a better cook, you're also becoming more likable somehow.
You're my idol.
I love you, man.
I love you too, Leslie.
Outside of getting married and having my children being born, this has to be one of those great things in my life that I will remeer fever.
Right now...
It's the MasterChef finale.
The world's biggest cooking competition comes to an end...
Whoo!
... as Elizabeth and Courtney go head-to-head...
What do you think of Courtney's dessert?
It looks like second place.
... for the most coveted crown in the culinary world.
Only one will walk away with $1/4 million...
Give me my knife, baby.
It's on.
... their own cookbook...
Winning would change everything.
... and the MasterChef title.
America's next MasterChef is...
Welcome to the finale of the biggest culinary competition of the year.
Tonight, the best two home cooks in America will battle it out here in the MasterChef kitchen.
Only one will be crowned MasterChef.
In our search for the absolute best home cook in this country, we went to every corner of this great nation.
MasterChef!
The best home cooks in America entered the MasterChef kitchen all united by their passion for food.
You are the top 22.
They were faced with ferocious challenges.
You got 60 guests, the bride and groom, and they're waiting!
Hut!
I need you on the grill!
You're not sorry at all!
I'm not gonna stand here and be abused.
Some wilted under intense pressure.
- I need a medic.
- Medic.
Quick!
You brought us a dish that you didn't make.
- Others rose...
- Whoo!
Growing stronger with every obstacle.
You're playing the game at a high level.
But to crown the best, we had to find the best.
The person leaving MasterChef tonight is Christian.
Cutter.
Leslie.
Now there are only two home cooks remaining.
Tonight, they will do battle head-to-head in the greatest kitchen in America, but only one will survive what they're about to endure.
Only one will become America's next MasterChef.
The first finalist is Elizabeth...
A 31-year-old advertise executive from Brooklyn, New York.
I grew up in the South, and I spent my entire life obsessing over moving to New York.
I work in advertising, and I enjoy my career, but I'm so ready to win MasterChef and change my life.
This is the last apron.
- After a quiet start...
- Congratulations.
Elizabeth soon rose to become one of the most consistent competitors in the MasterChef kitchen.
The winning mystery box dish...
Elizabeth.
From savory to sweet, comfort food to exotic global flavors...
- Whoo!
- Elizabeth mastered them all.
Wow.
This is like taking a trip to Italy.
Elizabeth has made MasterChef history...
The blue team, ladies and gentlemen.
Having never lost a team challenge.
I'm going to turn this finale into the key that unlocks my culinary dreams.
This is the most important day of my life.
She hasn't cooked in a single pressure test.
Tonight, can Elizabeth handle the pressure of this finale?
The only hurdle that stands in Elizabeth's way is Courtney...
A 25-year-old from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
It's very hard for me to talk about this.
I've done things that I'm not proud of.
Not being able to pay my rent,
I make the difficult, embarrassing decision to work in a gentlemen's club.
But cooking is the start of a new beginning.
I'm gonna do something else that I love and have so much passion for.
I want to make my family so proud.
Courtney made her mark when she became the very first home cook to win a white apron.
- Beautifully done.
Great job.
- Thank you.
She impressed us with her sophisticated European flavors and techniques.
You could taste the love that went into that.
As the pressure intensified...
Courtney, I hope you're joking.
I did that.
She began to stumble.
They're salty.
Eh.
I'm sorry, chef.
But she always managed to step back up to the plate.
Amazing.
You definitely got mojo back.
I want to change my life around, and winning this title is what changes everything.
A win tonight would take Courtney's talents to a very different stage.
Elizabeth and Courtney, congratulations on making it here to the MasterChef finale.
And here to cheer you on are all of your past competitors that you beat to get into this finale.
It's been a long time that you've been on this journey with us.
You've sacrificed so much, especially leaving all of your loved ones back home.
Elizabeth, what do you think that they'd say about you right now being here in the finale?
How proud they are of me.
Let's find out exactly what they would say.
Please welcome your family and friends from Brooklyn:
Your husband Ross, your mom Melissa, your brother Seth, your friends Janine, Jess, and Sarah.
Oh, my god.
Melissa, Elizabeth's under immense pressure tonight.
Any words of encouragement?
Cook your ass off.
Courtney, it's been a long time.
How much do you want to see your family?
I want to see my family so bad.
They want to see you even more.
Here they are.
Hey.
Your mom Lisa, your dad Dennis, sister Collette, Connor, your brother, and your other brother Colby.
Oh, my goodness.
Look at you.
Is Cooper here?
Now we're complete, right?
Captain Cooper, any final words of encouragement you'd like to say to your big sister?
Good luck.
Thanks, baby.
You guys are such an inspiration for these two amazing home cooks.
But now it's time to say good-bye and head up to the gallery.
Bye.
Love you.
Overcome adversity.
Love you, baby.
Hey, you are the best.
For tonight's challenge, we want one appetizer, one entree, and one dessert.
Three identical plates of each course,
One for each of us.
After you're done cooking each course, you'll serve your dishes to us in the MasterChef restaurant where we'll taste your dishes and make some very critical decisions.
You'll each have ten minutes in the MasterChef pantry to get everything you need to cook us the best three-course meal of your entire lives.
Your ten minutes in the pantry starts...
Now.
I want Elizabeth to win.
She's an excellent cook.
Unless she screws up,
I'm seeing her win the whole kit and caboodle.
You can't possibly count Courtney out.
Courtney works good under pressure.
Elizabeth is the terminator, and she's gonna shut Courtney down.
She has to.
It is her fate to stop Courtney.
Somebody has to stop Courtney.
If it was my money on the line,
Courtney got it.
Wow.
Here we go.
First up, your appetizer course.
Elizabeth.
I'll be making a grilled octopus with a warm chorizo and chickpea salad.
And Courtney, what will you be making for your appetizer tonight?
I will be making a crispy pig's ear with dandelion and fennel salad and a quail egg.
You'll both have one hour to make us those stunning appetizers.
Ladies, your time starts...
Now.
Come on, ladies!
- Let's go, you guys.
- Whoo!
- Yeah, Courtney!
- Let's go, sis.
Elizabeth should definitely be worried.
I'm not afraid of Elizabeth.
This is my battle to win, and it's go big or go home.
Come on, Elizabeth!
There are no heels in the kitchen anymore.
It's knives, and it's time to do battle.
Let's do this.
Come on, ladies!
In this season's MasterChef finale,
Elizabeth and Courtney are battling it out over a three-course dinner that they'll serve to the judges.
For their appetizers, Courtney's dish features a crispy pig ear salad with fennel and a quail egg, while Elizabeth has chosen to make grilled octopus with fennel, chorizo, and chickpeas.
Looking good.
All right.
This is it... the battle we've all been waiting for.
Elizabeth's appetizer, for instance, tonight...
A delicious-sounding braised octopus.
She's cooking it in the pressure cooker.
If she's off by even five minutes, we could be eating rubber bands.
Courtney is going out of the box.
Courtney made a pig ear.
Seriously, pig's ear salad?
Pig ears are, like, 99 cents a pound.
They used to be dog chews.
If you don't understand how that ear breaks down, you're gonna be left with a mouthful of cartilage.
But if you get that right, and you cook it beautifully, it's gonna be the dish of the night.
She's taking the biggest chances
I've ever seen a finalist take.
- Yeah, Courtney.
- Whoo!
How you doing, Courtney?
Hey.
I'm doing really good.
We've been through so many seasons of MasterChef, we've never seen pigs' ears in a finale.
Are you taking too much of a risk here tonight?
No, I'm sending a strong message.
Elizabeth should be very scared.
Good luck.
I'm excited to try that.
Thank you, chef.
I'm definitely interested in Courtney's menu.
I mean, the pig ear, I think it's a very awesome,
Trendy way to go, but it's definitely a risk.
It's a very hard dish to elevate.
Go, Elizabeth.
- Right, how you feeling?
- Good, chef.
Describe your appetizer.
I'm doing a grilled octopus with a warm chorizo and chickpea salad.
Why octopus?
There's nothing more impressive than that, and I want to start you on a Mediterranean journey.
Pressure cooker.
How you feeling?
- It's always a little bit of a hope and a prayer.
- I know.
You just got to wait for the last minute.
Quickly cleaning it, grilling it, getting it on the plate.
It's dangerous, but I'm gonna do it.
I'm just amazed that you're leaving this to the very last minute because literally 12 minutes to go.
The octopus is not cooked yet.
Courtney started to plate.
Are you running behind?
No, chef, I'm gonna have everything plated and do the octopus at the very last minute.
You are so daring.
Good luck.
Thanks, chef.
I think Elizabeth has the better menu.
The octopus...
now, that's a challenge.
If you nail it, boom, she's a shoo-in.
Oh, god.
Last ten minutes.
Let's go, ladies.
Courtney's strategy is working.
She put the full-court press on Elizabeth, and I think Elizabeth is beginning to buckle under the pressure.
Elizabeth, you've got to move faster.
- Yes, chef.
- Please.
Okay.
Here's the octopus.
Looks good.
90 seconds left, guys.
Let's go.
You've got to start plating, Elizabeth.
This food is very beautiful.
Exciting.
Oh, my god.
Yeah.
Let's go!
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
Hands in the air!
Now, please bring your dishes down to the front.
Thank you.
Courtney, what do you think of Elizabeth's octopus salad?
The plating's a little haphazard, but it's okay.
Elizabeth, what do you think of Courtney's pig's ear salad?
The pig ear maybe looks a little beige.
Well, we will be the judges of that.
Both of you, please follow us into the MasterChef dining room.
Let's go.
It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks.
It's all in the judges' hands now.
Elizabeth, please present your appetizers, thank you.
I'm taking a huge risk with this octopus.
It's not something that I cook at home all the time, but today, in the finale, big risk, big reward.
Elizabeth, describe your dish, please.
This is a grilled octopus with a warm chickpea and chorizo salad with a piquillo pepper and heirloom tomato sauce.
So I was concerned with the octopus in the pressure cooker, but I have to say that this octopus
Looks better than I would have ever imagined.
This is truly an octopus that I can eat with my eyes.
Thank you.
I very much like the grill portion of the octopus, but I think that you may have slightly overcooked the octopus.
But overall, very punchy, very Mediterranean, very, very strong dish.
- Thank you.
- The flavors are great.
I think that it's aggressively spiced and seasoned, which you've always done throughout the competition.
I think that that shows confidence in your cooking.
You know, if we received it in a restaurant,
I think we'd all be pretty happy with it.
Thank you.
Well, visually the dish is so appealing.
When you're using all those spices with those chickpeas, then you got this perfect foundation for that octopus to sit on the top.
Great flavor on the char.
Love that flavor.
Amazed you got it done in that short period of time.
Bold move, difficult to pull off.
You did just that.
Good job.
Thank you, chef.
Courtney, it's time to taste your appetizer, please.
You've got a very high bar to reach.
Courtney, describe your appetizer, please.
A crispy pig's ear over a dandelion and fennel salad with a quail egg and a guajillo chili sauce.
Is a salad with some fried pig ears enough for an appetizer in the biggest cooking competition in the world, is the question that I'm asking myself.
I believe so.
I believe that the dish is well-balanced.
You might believe that.
I'm asking myself that.
- Oh, sorry.
I thought you were...
- I'm not sure.
Is a salad with some fried pig ears enough?
I believe so.
I believe that the dish is well-balanced.
You might believe that.
I'm asking myself that.
- Oh, sorry, I thought you were...
- I'm not sure.
It's a typically Courtney plate.
It's meticulous, but just a little bit soulless.
Well, it's a really assertive, opinionated dish.
The pigs' ears were very good.
Crispy, salty, rich.
You have a great balance between acidity, heat, oil, and it's certainly one of the most well-dressed salads that I've eaten in recent history.
Thank you, sir.
I love the guajillo pepper sauce.
It's explosive, and it goes great with the rich quail egg.
Tastes great.
Thank you.
Visually it looks elegant.
Pig's ear cooked perfectly.
Shocked them, it sort of solidified all the fat.
The way you treated them was brilliant.
You deliver a punch with flavor.
Great job.
Thank you.
Ladies, you are clearly on another level, and we have some very important things to discuss.
Please prep for the entrees.
Thank you very much.
- Yes, sir.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
Thanks, guys.
Thank you.
Wow, I mean, Elizabeth, great octopus.
I mean, the flavor, delicious.
Yes, it was slightly overcooked, but technically, she pulled it off.
Courtney, out of nowhere, picks a pig ear.
It was a bold, bold statement.
- That's as gutsy as it gets.
- Brilliant.
Two more courses yet to come, so there is lots of culinary gamesmanship still to come to this table for us to taste.
Okay, it's time to get started on your entrees.
You will each have 60 minutes to make us the best main course that you have ever made in your entire life.
Your 60 minutes starts...
Now.
How do you follow those appetizers?
Well, that's the thing is, sometimes after the appetizer you have a clear leader.
- Right now, it's neck and neck.
- Neck and neck.
They're at ground zero again.
Come on, Elizabeth.
For my entree, I'm making spiced lamb and quinoa saute with a carrot puree and a mint yogurt sauce.
Serving the judges an overcooked or undercooked rack of lamb is not gonna fly, so I just need to absolutely nail the cook.
- Come on, Courtney.
- Whoo!
For my entree, I'm doing something that's very, very traditional.
I'm making a sumac duck breast with spring vegetables and farro.
- Whoo!
- Elizabeth!
- Right, how you feeling?
- Feeling good, chef.
How you gonna cook the lamb?
I'm gonna sear it off in a pan and then finish it in the oven until it's medium-rare.
Earlier tonight you left things right to the very last minute for the appetizer.
I mean, are you gonna cut yourself a little bit more time across this one?
Yes, I have plenty of time.
This is not like a pressure cooker situation.
I'm in full control of the lamb.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
- Hello, Courtney.
- Hey.
With this duck, do you think that ii gonna be strong enough to go against a lamb?
'Cause a lamb, a Rolls-Royce cut, restaurant...
But you know what?
So are my duck breasts.
And I started with the pig's ear, and because it was so out there, I wanted to do something that was a little bit more familiar.
- Ah, all right.
- All right, good luck.
Hey, Coop, you want to see some fire?
Yeah!
I mean, I can flambe, but I don't need to.
20 minutes to go.
Let's go.
Courtney's duck is out.
Both Courtney and Elizabeth tonight, with these proteins, have the risk of temperature.
If they don't nail that medium-rare, that will certainly sink their dishes.
Gorgeous.
Looks perfect.
Nice, Courtney.
I think the pressure's getting to Elizabeth.
Courtney's already plating, and Elizabeth's lamb is not even cooked yet.
It's still in the oven.
Tonight, I am struggling with timing more than I have any time previously cooking in the MasterChef kitchen, and I think that it's the added pressure of everyone watching and everything that's at stake.
The lamb's out.
All right, do or die.
Here we go.
Beautiful.
Elizabeth, that looks amazing.
That one looks really rare.
Last three minutes.
Unbelievable.
Elizabeth is leaving everything to the last minute
Just like she did with the appetizer.
90 seconds to go.
Come on.
Very cool, Courtney.
Very cool.
Thanks.
- Looks good, Elizabeth.
- Looks good.
- Come on.
Let's go.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
Push, push.
Come on!
Come on, Courtney!
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
Hands in the air!
Way to go, Courtney!
Please bring those stunning entrees down to the front.
Let's go.
Elizabeth, how are you feeling?
Some of my plating was a little rushed at the end, but I think ultimately it looks beautiful.
Courtney, what do you think of Elizabeth's dish?
I think that her lamb looks raw.
Ooh.
No, it's medium-rare.
Please, Elizabeth, Courtney, and the servers, bring those stunning entrees through to the MasterChef restaurant.
Let's go.
Thank you.
Courtney started something, and at this point, the gloves are off.
My dish is about to knock this bitch out.
It's on.
Let's begin tasting the entrees with Elizabeth.
It's a spiced lamb with red quinoa and rainbow chard, a carrot puree, and a mint yogurt tahini sauce.
I do feel, Joe, that you particularly got a dish where the lamb was a little bit under where I intended.
I wanted to serve it to yo a perfect medium-rare.
Well, if you were shooting for a perfect medium-rare, you didn't get there.
Mine's a rare to black and blue.
Gentlemen, shall we?
Most people probably would want their lamb a little bit more cooked.
Mine was definitely rare.
If cooked properly, it could be fantastic, so a little bit of a letdown.
My lamb's cooked perfectly.
That rub on the lamb is absolutely spot-on.
And what you've nailed here was the quinoa.
Combined with the tahini and that yogurt sauce, delicious.
Puree, wonderful.
Good job.
Thank you.
Visually it's a beautiful dish.
I loved the pop of the carrot puree.
Couldn't have seasoned it any better.
I would absolutely order this again
If I was in a restaurant and got it.
It's a knockout.
Really, really smart dish.
Thank you, chef.
Courtney, will you please present us with your entree?
This is a sumac duck breast with spring vegetables and farro garnished with a pea tendril and a chive blossom pickle, and the sauce is a brandy pan sauce with the duck fat.
Visually gorgeous, and I think it tastes as good as it looks.
The duck breast is crispy and bacon-like and really amazing, and the sauce, buttery and rich, but ve concentrated in flavor, so you get a little bit melting on each bite.
Overall, one of the best dishes I think that you've put up.
- Very commendable.
- Thank you.
The farro is delicious.
It's very nutty.
It's concentrated.
The spring vegetables were cooked perfectly.
It has the shallots.
Everything is really spot-on.
You know, it looks like it came out of a restaurant.
I'm a bit of a stickler when it comes to cooking duck, 'cause it's one of the most difficult proteins to nail.
The duck, beautifully done.
Elegance matched with fragrance, matched with great finesse.
Stunning, absolutely stunning.
- Thanks, Courtney.
- Yeah.
Both of you did amazing jobs.
A lot to discuss, so why don't you go ahead and get ready to do those desserts?
Two phenomenal entrees.
Courtney's duck was ambitious and very chef-driven.
It was well-thought out, and execution was perfect.
Elizabeth's lamb tasted delicious.
The flavors that she was working with were great.
The seasoning was right there.
As always, we're looking at the entire menu as a whole, so nobody is gonna win this based on where we're at right now.
We got to see that dessert.
I think that I made some small technical errors, but I'm still here.
Everything is on the line for this dessert course for me.
I got to nail it.
Elizabeth and Courtney, this next course will seal the deal for one of you.
Elizabeth, please describe your final course tonight.
For dessert, I'm making a grapefruit and olive oil cake with a plum trio.
Wow.
Courtney, please.
I'm doing a cherry meringue with salted chocolate and spiced almonds.
Now, what happens during the next 60 minutes will change one of your lives.
Your one hour starts...
Now.
Come on, Courtney.
Courtney's strong.
She's very strong, and she's a baker, so with desserts, she's a force to be reckoned with.
Courtney!
Courtney!
Yeah, Courtney!
Elizabeth is the real deal.
I've watched her.
I've cooked with her.
And her cake's gonna be a winner.
Elizabeth!
So what's the dish, Elizabeth?
It's an olive oil and grapefruit semolina cake, so it almost has, like, that delicious kind of cornbread texture.
Right, love it.
Courtney obviously has a lot to gain by winning this.
She wants this bad.
This is a game changer for her.
You want it as much as she does?
I absolutely want this as much as she does.
Just because I work in an office and not a nightclub does not mean I don't deserve to win this.
Spot on!
Good luck, Elizabeth.
Whoo!
All right, Courtney.
So a meringue.
I mean, any professional chef tonight would be looking at the meringue and saying, "What, in 60 minutes?"
They take literally hours to dry out.
How are you gonna fast-track these?
They're a nice, small size, so they're not gonna need as much time in the oven.
What is it with you that refuses to play safe?
No reason to play it safe, especially when it's something this big.
You just got to go for it.
- Good luck.
- Thank you, chef.
Let's go.
Come on, Courtney.
Come on.
- Yeah!
Come on, Elizabeth.
- Go, Elizabeth!
Here we go.
The cake's out.
My cake is slightly undercooked in the middle.
Oh, her cake looks like a mess over there.
But I have a plan.
to use the outer edge, so it's gonna be perfectly moist.
Not too dry or overbaked, but still cooked and edible.
Good.
I wanted to make sure that the salt content in my meringue is right,
So I take a bite of it...
- How is that, Courtney?
- It's good.
And then I realize I don't have any extra meringues.
I ate one of the judges' meringues.
Uh-oh, something happened.
I'm gonna look like I've given them an incomplete plate.
Oops.
I have just quite possibly eaten $1/4 million.
I ate one of the judges' meringues.
Uh-oh, something happened.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
I have just possibly eaten $1/4 million.
Let's go, ladies.
Last two minutes.
Come on.
Let's go.
That is beautiful.
Whoo!
30 seconds to go.
Come on.
Let's go.
Come on, guys.
Come on.
Whoo!
Looks beautiful!
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
and stop.
Wow.
Well done.
Bring your delicious desserts to the front of the bench.
Elizabeth, what do you think of Courtney's dessert?
I think it looks like second place.
Ooh.
After this tasting, one of you two will be crowned this year's MasterChef.
Let's get it on.
We're gonna bring those desserts into the restaurant.
Courtney, please bring us your dessert.
Thank you.
I made for you a cherry meringue with salted chocolate and spiced almonds.
Did we miss one?
'Cause it looks like three complete piles, and then we each got one empty one.
I was so concerned with how everything tasted together that I ate one of the meringues that needed to be the top to the third.
Let's hope it tastes better than it looks.
Is there salt in anything else other than the chocolate on this plate?
- The cherries.
- Something tastes salty.
- The cherries taste salty?
- Cherries maybe.
I put a little bit of salt into the black cherries just to bring out that flavor of it.
That's either really brilliant or really stupid.
But after eating it and processing it in my mind,
I have to say that I think...
It's brilliant.
Thank you, sir.
It is really elevating the intellectual component of a dessert to another level and making me not only eat it with my palate in my mouth but also digest it with my brain.
It's very intellectually and physically satisfying.
Thank you, sir.
The presentation obviously not what you wanted, but the taste is delicious.
The pastry cream with the vanilla bean going through it and the salted chocolate, all those are great.
The cherries balanced against the sweetness of those almonds, it's like this perfect harmony.
Kind of eye-opening.
I disagree with Joe.
Don't like salty cherries.
They taste like they're in a brine.
Meringues taste delicious.
I'm amazed you got them crisp on the outside, gooey and just right in the center.
Cooked to perfection, nailed them.
Pastry cream delicious.
The flavors are there, the texture's there, but it's just, sadly, your clumsiest plate.
I don't agree.
I apologize for that, chef.
Well...
Thank you.
Elizabeth, please step forward.
This is a grapefruit and olive oil semolina cake soaked in a grapefruit syrup with poached plums and just a little ground pistachio.
The actual olive oil cake I think is delicious.
I love the flavor.
It's got a great texture.
The puree is great.
The spiced pistachio helps balance the sweetness.
A really delicious dish.
Smart choice with this.
Thank you, chef.
Yeah, I'm putting this within the context of being an Italian dessert because my grandmother makes olive oil cake like this.
It's spot-on.
It's delicious.
It's rustic.
The coulis, the poached plums, the cake, the yogurt on top, fantastic.
It's a top-notch dish.
It fires on all cylinders.
Thank you.
Elizabeth, you knew it was undercooked in the center, yet you did the smartest thing, and you cut from the outside of the cake in.
There are professional chefs tonight watching that wouldn't even have the intelligence or the integrity to stand back and readjust, so I just want to commend you on that.
Thank you.
The cake itself, really delicious.
What makes it for me is the pink grapefruit, because that gives it the tartness, cuts the richness, and just really lifts that citrusy indulgence.
- Lovely.
- Thank you.
We now have to make one of the most difficult decisions
We've ever made in this entire competition, a decision that will affect both your lives.
We'll be crowning one of you the new American MasterChef.
Please give us a moment.
Elizabeth's, first off.
The cake was perfect.
- Her best dish of the night.
- Right.
I'm super proud of what I've done today.
100%, my menu's better.
It has more of a connective thread, and I believe my dessert showed the judges that I deserve to win.
But I think that Courtney's dessert really kind of showed her thinking on another level.
Courtney's dessert was the weakest performing dish of our entire finale.
I disagree, 'cause it takes the parameters of what is a dessert and pushes it to the limits, and if we're not here to do that, then I don't know what we're here to do.
I took risks.
I was daring.
I didn't play anything safe, and to me, that's what a MasterChef is.
We judge based on the entire spectrum of this menu.
App, entree, dessert...
Who has the best collection overall?
So Elizabeth's menu.
For the first 2/3 of this competition tonight, her time management was deplorable except for the last 1/3 where she nailed it on the dessert 100%.
Courtney's menu was the opposite.
She did not go on an ethnic or a regional theme.
Her menu was more enlightened cooking and taking risks.
I've never seen two finalists that were in the zone as much as these two.
We are seeing home cooks come through this kitchen who can, will, and should have an impact on how the rest of the world will eat.
So we agree we have a winner?
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Definitely.
Elizabeth and Courtney, you came to this competition as home cooks with a burning passion for food.
Medic.
Oh, my god.
is he all right?
Elizabeth and Courtney, you came with a burning passion for food.
Medic.
- Oh, my god.
- Is he all right?
Find some water, please, quickly.
- Oh, my god.
- Some water.
Get a chair.
Here we go.
Ross, you okay, bud?
- Here we go.
- Honey, are you okay?
There you go.
There's a chair.
Honey, are you okay?
There's a chair behind you.
- Some water, please.
- He went white.
Oh, my god.
I passed out.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Oh, I-I felt like that was gonna happen.
It's okay.
Have some water, sweetie.
We haven't announced the winner yet, okay?
So thanks for staying with us, okay?
- When I pass out, I really pass out.
- Wait for me, bud.
You got to wait for me.
I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry.
- Welcome back.
Good?
- I'm fine.
My husband loves me so much he passed out.
- Take a little sip of water.
- Okay.
- Take your time.
- Oh, my god.
I'm gonna have a heart attack.
But Gordon Ramsay saves the day yet again.
He gives him some water and picks him up and makes sure he's okay.
- You okay?
- I'm good.
Elizabeth and Courtney, we are so proud of the two of you.
This is my fate.
This is my future.
I think today I gave a really winning performance, and I do think I deserve to win.
It's clear that you have both elevated your skill.
I am the epitome of MasterChef.
You're here to change your life.
Yeah, I worked in a gentleman's club.
That's behind me, because now winning this title is what changes everything.
Tonight confirmed that you two are phenomenal chefs, and that's why we'd like you both to come up here and switch places with us.
Our decision wasn't easy.
It came down to the tiniest of details.
That's how close it was this evening.
But as you know, there can only be one winner.
One of you is about to win
$1/4 million.
One of you will go on to publish your very own cookbook.
And one of you will claim this...
The most coveted title in the culinary world,
The title of MasterChef.
America's next great MasterChef is...
Congratulations...
Courtney.
Well done.
Well done.
- Thank you!
- Oh, my god.
I've never given up.
I've been through the wringer.
I've made so many sacrifices, and this validates all of them.
You said I was worthy, daddy.
You're darn right, honey.
This trophy means no more student loans.
My mom gets a kitchen, and I have a secure future in cooking.
Yeah!
Sorry, guys.
Oh, don't say that.
Ugh, why didn't I put the lamb in sooner?
I'd be $250,000 richer.
But you know what, Courtney deserves it.
But I did things that I didn't think I was ever capable of doing.
I'm really proud of myself.
Mwah!
Who's America's next MasterChef?
Courtney!
Salud.
My mom looking at me winning this title means so much to me.
Louder!
I've had highs and lows.
I've come so far, and I've made her and my father and my siblings so proud of me.
- Whoo!
- Whoo!
Wow, what a night.
Now, if you think you've got what it takes to become America's next MasterChef,
I cannot wait to see you.
I am America's MasterChef!
Yeah!
Sync corrections:
Ajvngou
This is the toughest decision that we've made so far.
...as two big names...
Christian.
Cutter.
... exited the MasterChef kitchen.
Tonight, it's a two-hour MasterChef with the ultimate culinary title at stake.
The three best home cooks in America take on the season's most intimidating challenge.
50 chefs representing 50 states.
Wow.
But only two will make the finale.
The pressure is on.
- I loved it.
- I'd put that on my menu.
And the world's biggest cooking competition comes to an end...
Absolutely spot on.
- It's a knockout.
- It leaves me wanting more.
... as this season five MasterChef is crowned.
America's next MasterChef is...
Welcome.
Oh, my god.
I'm in the semifinals.
This time last year I was cooking in my teeny little electric stove kitchen in Philadelphia with my cat, and now this is my chance to shine.
Courtney, Leslie, and Elizabeth, congratulations.
- Thank you, chef.
- Thank you.
You are the final three in the biggest culinary competition in the world.
This is the semifinal, so as well as winning $1/4 million and your very own cookbook, one of you is only a few dishes away from winning this...
The coveted MasterChef trophy.
I did a wonderful job taking care of my wife and my children.
My goal now is to do something for me.
That trophy will change my life forever.
For me, that trophy is my ticket to publish my own cookbook, which I've been dreaming of for years.
For this challenge, we want you to cook a special dish for some very special guests.
Each and every one of those guests is perfectly placed to judge your food because each of tonight's guests are all... chefs.
- What?
- Oy.
We have one amazing professional chef from each and every state in this country... 50 chefs.
Tonight, you have to serve them in the MasterChef restaurant a composed MasterChef-worthy entree.
But prepping and cooking for 50 chefs...
Come on, it's impossible for you to do it alone.
So tonight we've brought you some help.
Ohh.
I see Willie, Daniel,
Ahran, Victoria, Christian, and Jaimee to boot.
I was down in a pressure test with every one of them.
You counted me out.
The old man's still standing.
It's wonderful being back.
Getting the call to come back is totally, like, awesome.
With your future and fortune at stake, there's only really one fair way to decide who you will be working with...
Fortune cookies.
You'll each randomly take two fortune cookies, and whichever name is inside that fortune cookie will be your sous chefs tonight.
Please, all three of you, come up and take two cookies each.
Courtney, please open one of those cookies and tell us who you have.
- Daniel.
- Good job.
- Stand next to Courtney.
- Thank you.
Hey.
Leslie.
I got what I wished for, Ahran.
- Ahran.
- Wow.
Nice!
For some reason, I knew this was gonna happen.
like, something about my fate is always in Leslie's hands.
Elizabeth, please open up one of those fortune cookies.
Jaimee.
- Oh.
- Wow.
- Wow.
- Wow.
Courtney, please open your final fortune cookie.
Big Willie.
Big Willie, wow.
Leslie.
All my dreams come true.
Christian.
Wow.
I know a chef when I see one.
How you doing, brother?
Elizabeth, you have Victoria.
Yeah, what's up, yo?
Hell yeah.
Get over here.
What are the odds?
Now we want restaurant quality, elevated entrees good enough to be eaten by the best chefs in the country.
You will have just 90 minutes to conceive, prep, and plate your stunning dishes.
You are one step away from the finale.
It's all on the line tonight.
Your 90 minutes starts...
Now.
Christian, let's go down here.
There's gonna be 50 chefs from all over the country in the dining room critiquing our food.
I mean, that's crazy.
I'm doing a prime fillet.
I'm gonna make an herb gnocchi.
Lots of butter.
If you can just get the fish out,
I'll meet you over there.
It's a dream come true, but it's also terrifying to cook for that many amazing chefs.
We're gonna make a skin-on pan-seared red snapper fillets with cauliflower three ways and a really awesome Mediterranean relish.
Daniel, have you seen lemon grass yet?
If we think it's hard getting anything past
Chef Ramsay, chef Elliot, and Joe, it's gonna be 50 times harder getting it past all of these chefs.
We're doing a ginger soy-glazed halibut with a beet dashi, golden beets.
Also doing a chile sauce.
- Get to it.
- Okay.
Let's do this.
I think that's it.
Let's go.
Wow, wow, wow.
4 1/2 cups of hot water.
- I need a bigger...
- Bigger pot?
I'll go get it.
You need the Japanese turner so you can start this?
- He's got it right there.
- Okay.
This is it.
What a big night.
I mean, it's as much pressure tonight as there is in the final.
50 chefs in your dining room?
Come on.
Even for a professional chef, it's a big ask.
No, not there yet.
So Courtney picked halibut with kind of an Asian twist.
If there's one thing chefs hate in the best of times, it's overcooked fish.
Yeah, literally, this fish hangs around
- two minutes longer...
- It's like powder.
- Yeah, it goes to mush.
- Mm-hmm.
Elizabeth's dish, she's doing cauliflower.
It's a glazed pan-seared red snapper.
Very seasonal.
It's a dish that caught my attention.
Leslie picked meat.
He's going with a fillet with gnocchi.
I didn't know why he's put those two together.
- What are your herbs for?
- Herb gnocchi.
I think he's looking at the fillet as being a star and then trying to come up with a creative side.
- All right, chives, done.
- Thank you.
This is just the wrong one.
30 minutes gone.
You've now got one hour remaining.
Get organized.
Two minutes from now the chefs are arriving.
- Let's get all of this.
- No, this is more than enough.
Come on, guys, speed up, please.
The chefs are arriving.
Please welcome tonight's judges, some of the greatest chefs in America.
From Mississippi, Cat Cora.
- Oh, my god.
- Oh.
From Maryland, Michael Voltaggio.
From Ohio, Susan Feniger.
From Michigan, Duff Goldman.
Arizona, Suzanne Tracht.
It's like a never-ending parade of famous people that I'm obsessed with.
Representing California, Jet Tila.
Illinois, Mary Sue Milliken.
Oh, my god!
From Nevada, Herb Wilson.
This is absurd.
From Missouri, Anthony Carron.
John Sedlar from New Mexico.
Casey Lane from Texas.
Tom Shields from West Virginia.
This is huge.
We're having some of the best chefs in America sitting down waiting to taste our food.
If I don't bring my "a" game today, man,
I'm gonna be in trouble.
The pressure is on.
Please welcome tonight's judges, some of the greatest chefs in America.
Wow!
It's so incredible.
We are serving 50 chefs from 50 different states.
It's like all of the cookbooks I've been studying from came to life and just walked into the kitchen right by me.
This is amazing.
Seeing my idols walk in...
oh, my god.
Time to step my game up.
It's like, these people don't even know I, like, worship them, and I'm about to cook for them.
It's amazing.
I just took a picture of you taking a picture.
- It's pretty awesome.
- Very exciting.
Okay, guys, just over 50 minutes until service begins.
- Courtney.
- Yes, chef?
Wake up, now, yeah?
Describe the dish.
I'm doing Asian ginger soy-glazed halibut with a beet dashi vermicelli.
Quite modern, very vibrant.
Why halibut?
Halibut has a really nice, white, flaky meat that will complement my sweet sauce.
- Overcooks easily.
- I know that.
- It'll be very unforgiving.
- Yep.
And even when I get two chefs in my restaurants, you know, it's a big deal.
I've never had 50 chefs.
How're you feeling?
The pressure is definitely on, but I'm feeling very confident because I've prepared well, and I know that with good preparation comes good execution.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
Three, baby, only three.
We don't want to crowd you too much.
Here, take a bite.
Whoa, that's awesome.
So what's the dish, Elizabeth?
Tell me.
This is a Mediterranean skin-on red snapper with a watercress puree, a pistachio puree, and cauliflower three ways.
It sounds very contemporary, sounds very restaurant-y.
Is that what you're going for?
Absolutely.
Out of the three of us,
I have the most restaurant-y, chef-y dish, and I think that's the perfect audience for what I'm cooking.
But is it a good strategy to propose such a chef-y dish to 50 chefs?
- Yeah.
- Good luck.
- Leslie.
- Yes, sir.
Tell me what the dish is.
It's an 8-ounce fillet with summer vegetables, herb gnocchi with mushrooms and a demi-glace red wine sauce.
I've never in my life seen fillet and gnocchi mixed together though.
Listen, you told me to reach for the stars.
I'm reaching for the stars.
I'm throwing something down.
- It's very tasty.
- Thank you.
Looks beautiful.
25 minutes remaining.
Let's go.
I'm so excited to have these 50 chefs here.
- It's amazing.
- Amazing.
These chefs will decide who wins this challenge and goes straight to the finale of MasterChef.
To you.
I hope that the home cooks do us proud.
Elizabeth's team is amazing, very harmonious.
She's controlling it.
She's dictating the terms, and they are listening.
Jaimee, test that cauliflower for me.
It's really kind of impressive to watch.
Wow.
I turned off the burners.
They're definitely cooked.
Okay.
Daniel, can you get me a fish spatula?
Thank you.
Courtney's on the other hand, halibut...
You don't really start recommending halibut for a large contingent, especially chefs.
It's not the fish you'd give them, is it?
No, there's no fat in it.
It goes dry right away.
And then to do it in an Asian style for the first time ever in this competition...
One more minute.
I think she's playing without a net.
Get the vegetables squared away.
I need the mushrooms cut too.
Leslie is so confident about this dish.
They got to be almost stiff.
Taste them.
- Stiff?
- You got it.
This is gonna be incredible.
Taste, taste, taste.
You want a nice texture.
He's just in the driver's seat right now.
They're soft enough for me.
- Way too hard.
Way too hard.
- Incredible.
Gnocchi's done.
What can I do for you?
- Set plates up.
- Yeah?
If I had to hire one of these three home cooks as a chef in my restaurant today,
- it would be Leslie.
- Wow.
- He's on fire.
- Wow.
Watch it.
Ah...
Careful, careful, careful.
Come on, Leslie.
Watch out, man.
Take it off.
Take your foot off.
Take your foot off.
Take your foot off.
I've got it, Leslie.
I've got it.
Damn, damn, damn.
Sorry.
When it rains, it pours.
15 minutes remaining.
Got to start clearing down.
Get organized, lay out the plates.
Count the plates.
Let's go.
Letting down my culinary idols would be unthinkable,
So plating is more critical than ever.
So just a little spoonful right in the middle.
let it kind of fall as it will.
Because you are serving it to people who look at every dish with the eyes of a chef.
Beautiful, Ahran, beautiful.
- All right, let's whack it.
- Whack it.
Couple more gnocchi on this plate.
You got it.
Thank you.
Leslie's plating, Elizabeth's plating.
Sauce at the end here.
I got the sauce.
Courtney's got nothing on the plate, bar her name.
Still the same game plan with the plating?
- Daniel.
- Yes, chef?
Is anyone gonna start plating?
- I'm getting directions.
- Yes, sir, getting directions.
But is anybody gonna start plating?
The noodles are ready.
You want them start going...
- Courtney!
- Yes, chef.
Is anybody gonna start plating?
I'm telling him to start plating right now.
We need to step up a gear, guys.
We're going right now.
Guys, don't forget, in the restaurant we have a chef from every state in America.
Let's go, guys.
Come on.
All of you, speed up.
Courtney's got no plates dressed.
We got 12 minutes to go.
All I need to hear is what goes in the vermicelli.
I keep telling you it's all of the noodles and the sauce.
Here, you do it yourself.
Willie and Daniel, do you have any idea what's going on?
That's what I'm trying to get details on, chef.
I've said it more than enough times.
- Say it again.
- So let's do that right now.
- Oh, my god.
- Make it happen.
Make it happen.
- I did what you told me to do.
- Okay.
Eight minutes to go.
- Do it.
- You don't wanna toss it in the broth?
Get going.
No, just get going.
- Put the noodles down.
- Come on.
We got to get it on the plate, okay?
We've got to get it on the plate.
Okay, keep it cool.
This is my worst nightmare coming to life.
Finish all of them.
Oh, my goodness, me.
This is insane.
Eight minutes to go.
With time running out in tonight's semifinal challenge, the final three home cooks must conceive and cook a restaurant-quality dish for 50 of the biggest culinary names in the country.
We're looking for flavor.
We're looking for presentation.
This is MasterChef, and althou ty're home cooks,
I'm looking for raw talent.
I'm expecting culinary magic, and I came here hungry.
Last two minutes.
Make it happen.
Make it happen.
- I did what you told me to do.
- Okay.
This is insane.
You don't wanna toss it in the broth?
- Do it and get going.
- No, just get going.
- Put the noodles down.
- Come on.
We gotta get it on the plate, okay?
- Don't start yelling now.
- We got to get it on the plate.
Okay, keep it cool.
My name is on the plate.
It doesn't say "Daniel" or "Big Willie."
It says "Courtney."
Sauce.
There's no sauce on that one.
We got to do sauces.
Willie, get the... the red sauce is right in front of you.
Turn around.
There's no fish on this one.
And I'm not okay with how they look.
This looks like crap.
45 seconds to go.
All right, let's push it out.
Looking good, you all.
Let's go, guys.
Come on!
Ooh, watch out, watch out.
Ten, nine, eight...
- Let's go!
- Seven, six...
Come on!
- Five...
- Come on, you guys.
Four, three, two, one.
And stop.
Hands in the air.
Here come the servers.
Really careful, guys, 'cause they're stacked pretty tall.
Gentle, like a lover.
Gently.
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.
The fillet came out beautifully.
The gnocchi looks great.
Everything looks perfect.
Courtney, Leslie, and Elizabeth,
Please say good-bye and thank you to your sous chefs.
Bye, you guys.
- I'm so sorry for...
- It's okay, honey.
- Bye.
- See you soon.
Love you.
Bye, you guys.
Having my dream team by my side was amazing, but at the end of the day, this is my plate.
I own it.
I'm proud of it, and I'm hyper-confident.
Okay, Elizabeth,
Leslie, and Courtney,
I'd like all three of you to come with us into the MasterChef restaurant and explain to our 50 chefs from 50 states what you've cooked for them tonight.
Let's go.
As an aerial dancer,
I've been on a stage in front of huge audiences for most of my life, and I'm starting to feel scared right now.
Ladies and gents, chefs, first of all a great honor it is to have you all here.
First ever in the history of this competition that we can get such an elaborate array of talent in one room.
Courtney, describe your dish please.
Tonight I have prepared for you a pan-seared halibut that I've glazed with ginger and soy.
Beneath that is a beet dashi vermicelli and surrounding the plate is a guero chile sauce.
Looks good.
- Thank you.
- Leslie, please.
My plate tonight is a 8-ounce fillet that was pan roasted with a herb gnocchi, and some summer vegetables, and a wine reduction.
Elizabeth, please.
I've made for you a pan-seared skin-on red snapper with cauliflower three ways, harissa-roasted white cauliflower puree, and a purple cauliflower couscous, and a little pistachio puree.
Great.
Courtney, Leslie, Elizabeth, please head back in to the MasterChef kitchen while these amazing chefs taste your dishes.
Please, look at the dishes.
Break it down.
Reward creativity, flare, imagination, and of course, obviously, it's about the taste.
Enjoy, and a big thank you again for making the effort to be here.
Oh, my god, I want to know what they're saying in there.
Ugh.
They're probably loving the idea of your cauliflower couscous.
Being a seafood chef, my first and foremost is gonna be the fish, but she's also taken that same attention to the vegetables.
She really did do cauliflower three ways.
She's got three different textures, three different preparations, three different colors, three different flavors.
Every single component works separately, and it works together.
Could use a little bit of seasoning, but you can taste the cauliflower.
So you kind of went, like, an Asian flavor profile.
That's interesting.
Yeah, the judges kept saying to me,
"What haven't you shown us?"
So I was like, "I'll show you Asian."
Courtney did a good job cooking the fish.
- The halibut's cooked nice.
- Mm-hmm.
I do like this flavor of the broth on the noodles.
Very sophisticated.
You could have this in an upscale restaurant.
She knocked it out of the park with that dish.
It could use more sauce.
When I heard you were doing gnocchi for that many people I was like,
"This man has gone insane."
Mine seemed fine.
Everything, the gnocchi held up.
It was tough though.
Although steak is safe, gnocchi's not safe.
It's a gamble to try to cook a gnocchi for not just chefs, but for anybody.
Flavor-wise, it's delicious.
It's seasoned.
The meat is cooked perfectly.
This would be a dish I'd order in a restaurant, like, beef and mushrooms and red wine, classic combination.
There were, like, good elements, but it's kind of...
it's a little disjointed.
I have to say, this is my choice right here.
Yeah, I would agree.
I-I definitely think Elizabeth stole the show, yeah.
I'd sell this dish in my restaurant.
I'm gonna go with Leslie.
Things are cliches for a reason.
Is it culinary genius?
Maybe not.
I loved it.
Courtney...
look how beautiful this is.
Look at that.
Perfect.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Perfect.
Wow.
When I walk in and I see the chorus line of amazing chefs, they are going to send someone right into the finale.
The home cook that we'd like to invite down here...
My dish should beat Leslie and Elizabeth's because it's original.
It's showing chef-like qualities.
The individual with the dish of the night...
I need to win.
I need to get up on that balcony and be number one, or otherwise I don't know.
Another pressure test, number seven?
I mean, come on, really?
Congratulations goes to...
Wow.
The individual with the dish of the night,
Congratulations goes to...
Elizabeth.
Amazing.
I am so happy.
I get to walk through the hallway of chefs.
I'm in the finale, and I am thrilled beyond words.
Well done.
Please, head up to the balcony.
There's a very cool glass of champagne waiting for you.
Great job.
Leslie and Courtney, please make your way down.
On behalf of everybody here at MasterChef,
I'd like to say a big special thank you to our talented chefs standing behind you.
Much appreciated.
Hope to see you again.
Thank you.
So now it's between me and Courtney.
I am psyched about this.
I'm not gonna let anything get in my way, and I'm gonna get this thing done.
All right, Courtney and Leslie, well done.
Tough challenge tonight.
Unfortunately, not in the same league as Elizabeth.
Now both of you will perhaps the most grueling and the most important pressure test you've ever done in this competition, where only one of you will join Elizabeth in the grand final of MasterChef.
Next time we see you, it's gonna be intense.
There have been seven other people who have tried to send Leslie home in the pressure test, and they've failed.
This is my chance to send him back to Malibu.
Today I'm going into the biggest battle of my life.
I can do this.
I can make this happen.
I will be in the finale.
Welcome.
Good to see you both.
Come on down, please.
Elizabeth is the first person to be catapulted into the MasterChef finale.
The task now is to find out which one of you two will be facing Elizabeth.
In a previous challenge, we had you make an incredibly complex composed entree.
Now it's time for dessert, but not just any dessert.
Three desserts that celebrate the greatness of America, the united cakes of America.
First up, you have something that I am very familiar with, a proud staple of my hometown...
New York cheesecake.
Ooh.
Tangy, rich, cheese filling.
Nestled in a crisp graham cracker crust, topped with a beautiful strawberry coulis.
Next up...
From the great state of Florida, we have key lime pie.
Tangy, smooth, bursting with fresh flavor, and it's all about balance,
Sweet versus tart.
Next up, you have another great American regional dessert.
From the great state of Massachusetts, you have a delicious Boston cream pie.
Two gorgeous layers of sponge with a phenomenal cream filling between them, and then the whole thing is covered in a stunning chocolate ganache.
This is a tall order for anybody, and for someone who doesn't bake, this is a nightmare.
Courtney, Leslie, any last words for each other?
If she wins fair and square, fine with me, but I'm not going down sleeping, that for damn sure.
Now it's time to head to your stations.
You have two hours to make us all three incredibly challenging desserts from different parts of this great country.
You all have everything that you need to make these three difficult desserts.
Bake better than you've ever baked before, because if you don't, it will be the last time you'll be making anything here in the MasterChef kitchen.
Your time starts...
Now.
So Leslie's seventh pressure test tonight.
Wouldn't that freak you out if you were Courtney?
We've always known she's a baker, so she got the luck of the draw.
Yeah, but, I mean, Leslie's excelled too, so it's not like one-sided, like she was given an advantage with this.
No, but tonight's all about nerves of steel.
One mistake, and they're out.
You have to cook with composure.
I'm freaking losing time right now.
I'm gonna beat Leslie because I've been baking cakes forever.
I love baking cakes.
This is one of my favorite things to do.
I can see myself in the finale already.
Months ago, it would take them two hours to do one cake.
Tonight, we're asking them to do all three in two hours.
What cake has to go first?
Get that cheesecake in the oven immediately because you haven't got time.
It's the longest cook time?
- It's an hour to cook.
- An hour?
An hour to cook.
and then cool.
I got to get moving, man.
After that, start tackling the Boston cream pie
- 'cause that sponge...
- got to bake the sponge.
Oh, man, that is a difficult one.
Then from there, start on the easiest one I think, which is the key lime.
Right, you have to have that lime zest and you want that acidity to come through.
But the cheesecake is the big one that needs to go in the oven within the first 20 minutes.
- Oh!
- Sorry.
25 minutes gone.
95 minutes to go.
Just keep this going, Courtney.
Keep it going.
Right, Courtney, how are you feeling?
Oh, I'm feeling incredible.
Cheesecake's in?
Cheesecake is in, chef.
Now, you look composed.
You look together.
Can you do this?
Absolutely.
I can totally do this.
This is what I love to do.
I've never seen anyone so happy in a pressure test.
- I know.
- Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm great.
I'm not just a girl wearing high heels.
I'm a girl that can cook.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
Spoons, spoons, spoons, spoons, spoons.
Gorgeous.
Let's keep this going.
I notice Courtney talking herself through the challenge.
You got to fold it gently.
Yes.
She's like, "It looks beautiful.
Now I just have to put the cream of tartar in."
Beautiful.
Yes.
"Yes, it looks beautiful."
Leslie talks to himself too, but he's like,
Hey, what do I gotta put the...
Eh, I got the cream of tartar, and I got the...the...
gotta whip the lemon meringue."
Mmm.
It's like you feel, like, seven separate voices talking to him in his own head.
Shh-shh-shh.
Leslie, how we doing?
- Not doing so good.
Not doing so good.
- What's wrong?
No, not doing so good, man.
- This is not my strength, man.
- Look, I know.
You just gotta slow down, take a breath.
which cake is that?
This is the cheesecake.
Courtney's cheesecake is cooked already.
Yeah, because she's...
she's a baker, you know?
She's done.
It's cooked.
Yes, I understand.
You want to know what?
Why are you so far behind?
'Cause I don't do this.
This is not my forte.
The timing of the cheesecake leaves you no net.
No.
No net whatsoever.
And it might not even cool down in time.
I am so frazzled.
I got too many things going through my head.
Got to get this thing in the oven or otherwise I'm gonna be screwed.
Unless there's a miracle, this cheesecake is not gonna cook.
The party might be over.
Still to come tonight...
It's the MasterChef finale.
But which of these home cooks will battle Elizabeth for the MasterChef title?
America's next MasterChef is...
Which cake is that?
This is the cheesecake.
This is not my forte.
This is not one of my strengths.
It does set you behind a little bit.
Yes, it does.
Do you have any progress on the other cakes, here you just been doing this?
Yes, I do.
No, I just gotta get...
- I got to get it first.
- Slow down, slow down, slow down.
You got to relax a little bit.
No, I can't.
You know, I'm always on the verge of a nervous breakdown, but I'm not going there.
Lady, who's your daddy?
Leslie is a bit all over the place.
He just put the cheesecake in.
We're not even sure if there's enough time to cool it down.
Leslie has fallen behind on the cheesecake.
He may be trying to make up for the other two.
So key lime pie is the simplest, but also really there's a balancing act between sweet and sour.
How do you manage that?
If it's too acidic, then you add more sugar.
If it's too sweet, then y you need to add a little bit more citrus.
So you've got to find that balance.
The Boston cream pie is a difficult one.
The secret in the sponge is the aeration, incorporating those eggs and the butter and the sugar.
What's a perfect Boston cream?
That is the base of a great pastry cream, but again, too heavy in that, they can split the sponge.
Leslie's pulling his cheesecake out.
But the big question tonight is:
is Leslie's New York cheesecake
- cooked?
- Right.
30 minutes remaining.
Let's go.
Okay, I need to get my cheesecake, and I can finish the cheesecake, and everything will all be good in the world.
Time's a ticking.
I'm taking a licking, but guess what.
These are done, so I'm happy about that.
Oh, my cheesecake is gorgeous.
Courtney, how we doing?
I'm doing so good.
How does it feel to be in here now?
I mean, the semifinal?
This is how I want to do this, this is how I want to enter the finale.
This is just me versus Leslie in the kitchen.
This is how I want to win it.
Awesome.
Good luck.
Thank you, chef Elliot.
Look at Leslie go.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
That looks good.
Oh, he's gonna drop it if he's not careful.
Palette knife.
Palette knife, Leslie.
It will fall off.
It'll slide off.
So tarts are both done.
Cheesecakes are both done.
Now it comes down to the Boston cream pie.
Courtney's just taken her sponge out.
But you can see Leslie right now.
He had these nice, beautiful ones.
It's not gonna be from a lack of trying, that's for freaking damn sure.
You can start to see the stress on Courtney's face.
Yeah.
It's really low right there.
Winning this pressure test is your ticket right to the finale, and Leslie probably has the upper hand just by virtue of the fact that he's been through so many pressure tests.
I mean, it's like his second job at this point, and he seems to be coming back.
Gentle, baby, gentle.
Gentle, gentle, gentle.
Less than 15 minutes to go.
Now is gonna be the most exciting, 'cause that's when they have to start assembling them.
And you just visually will know whether you're going home or going to join Elizabeth in the finale.
Leslie's about to start filling his Boston cream pie.
looks good.
Wow.
Yeah, pastry cream looks nice.
Oh, my god.
- That looks amazing.
- Oh, no.
Oh, my gosh, she's putting it in directly.
Just got to do it like this.
Oh, no.
Courtney's cakes look a little uneven.
Like, her pastry cream is oozing out from the middle.
Right now, Courtney is completely falling apart.
Last five minutes.
Son of a bitch.
He's a mad man.
Last minute, guys.
finishing touches, please.
Come on, place in the final for one of you.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
And stop.
Hands in the air.
Good job.
Courtney's cheesecake looks like you googled the perfect cheesecake.
It is completely flawless.
So the knife is going through very nicely.
It's nice and smooth.
Okay, here we go.
How does that look?
I think it looks delicious.
The crust is crispy.
The cream cheese cake itself is light, airy, rich, smooth.
- Very good.
- Thank you.
- Okay, Leslie.
- Yes.
Less aesthetically appealing, but, as we say, it's all about the taste.
Ooh.
Yes, it looks a little...
See, that looks super creamy, super, like...
- Yes, right there.
- Raw.
Let's taste it though.
The graham cracker crust is a little...is burnt.
Tastes like burnt chocolate chips cookies.
You know that flavor?
Yeah, yeah.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
Given the circumstances,
I would say you both did a pretty good job with those cheesecakes.
Thank you.
One looked much more like the cake we were asking for and tasted closer to what we were expecting.
The best cheesecake tonight belongs to...
Courtney.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Courtney, what do you think?
I was a little overexcited with the blow torch.
Yeah, looks like key lime s'mores.
- It's very sweet.
- Okay.
You know, with key lime pie,
I love that sharp...
Tartness.
Acidic tang coming through, and this is...
it's almost obliterated.
The only lime I'm really getting is from the zest over the top.
Okay.
All right, so, Leslie, anything I should know about this?
Uh, no, this one I kind of, uh, hit it on the mark.
The flavor's awesome.
It's got that zing to it.
The curd baked perfectly, great texture.
You nailed it.
Great job.
Thank you, chef.
Key lime pie, with everything, it comes down to the details.
The winning key lime pie belongs to...
Leslie.
Great job on that key lime pie.
Thank you, chef.
I definitely won the key lime.
Now we got to go to the Boston cream.
Whoever wins this is going into the finale.
I'm watching this pastry cream ooze out the sides, and I'm just seeing myself walking out of the MasterChef doors.
So it comes down to the Boston cream pie.
Courtney.
Courtney, Courtney, Courtney.
I know.
I'll just have a little look at that.
Mine's quite even on the top, at least...
I'm not talking about the unevenness.
I'm talking about the slurry and the sludge
That's oozing out of yours.
That should be stuck together.
Thank you.
- Uh, Leslie.
- Yes, chef.
Lovely ratio.
Sponge slightly too thick, but nice density of pastry cream inside.
Wow.
Thank you.
Please, Courtney, Leslie, come around to the front, thank you.
We now have to work out which one of you moves on to the MasterChef grand finale.
Please, give us a minute.
Thank you.
- Courtney is a mess.
- Yeah.
There's no creamn the, is there?
Boston cream pie is about the cream.
Yeah, it's like a liquid center cake.
Leslie's had a great pastry cream.
There's something really weird tasting at the bottom.
It's like a weird bread.
He needed a little more sugar or something?
Yeah, I think that probably is what's wrong with it.
- Something major.
- Mm-hmm.
It all comes down to the Boston cream pie, and it seems like Leslie's has the edge.
All right, Courtney,
You had highs and lows, insufficient pastry cream, pastry cream slightly liquid, top heavy, it terms of, good ganache, lovely sponge.
Leslie, visually incredible, great pastry cream, ganache delicious, but something very odd came to mind whilst tasting the sponge.
Why don't you just have a taste of that, please.
Do you know what's wrong with that sponge?
You put the salt in place of the sugar.
I may have, yes.
The home cook who made the best Boston cream pie and the person who will now move into the MasterChef finale and face-off against Elizabeth, that person is...
Courtney.
Oh, my god.
Congratulations.
You did an amazing job.
I tried.
I made a simple mistake.
Not a problem.
Thank god.
I was certain that I was going home.
Wow.
I feel bad for Leslie.
It was such an honest mistake.
Seven pressure tests.
Finally one got you.
Yeah, and you know what?
I figured my luck kind of ran out after six, but she just happened to knock me off my pedestal.
Everyone in America who's ever baked more than one cake, including myself, has made the same exact mistake that you made tonight.
Leslie, you have been phenomenal.
And for anybody out there that ever tells me again that cooking is a young man's game, you've turned that around on its head.
Thank you, chef.
Come and say good-bye, big man.
Thank you very much.
It was a pleasure meeting you guys.
You guys are my idols.
Right, two talented individuals.
Who is your money on?
I'm sorry, Courtney, but I would definitely put my money on Elizabeth.
Thank you, Leslie.
- Thank you again, chef.
- Well done.
All right.
I'm the stay-at-home dad that came here to win, and I was doing a pretty damn good job up until the salt part.
This is a great looking pie.
You really nailed it.
Awesome dish.
You're up at the top right now.
All of you, right now, get your ass down here quickly.
That's what I call a box of donuts.
Wow.
I learned a lot.
I mean, I didn't expect to make it this far.
I met interesting people.
Some liked me.
Some didn't like me.
I can hear you.
I don't need to look at you.
I need you to look at me!
You're not sorry at all!
I did not expect to work out my differences with this young lady.
Not only are you becoming a better cook, you're also becoming more likable somehow.
You're my idol.
I love you, man.
I love you too, Leslie.
Outside of getting married and having my children being born, this has to be one of those great things in my life that I will remeer fever.
Right now...
It's the MasterChef finale.
The world's biggest cooking competition comes to an end...
Whoo!
... as Elizabeth and Courtney go head-to-head...
What do you think of Courtney's dessert?
It looks like second place.
... for the most coveted crown in the culinary world.
Only one will walk away with $1/4 million...
Give me my knife, baby.
It's on.
... their own cookbook...
Winning would change everything.
... and the MasterChef title.
America's next MasterChef is...
Welcome to the finale of the biggest culinary competition of the year.
Tonight, the best two home cooks in America will battle it out here in the MasterChef kitchen.
Only one will be crowned MasterChef.
In our search for the absolute best home cook in this country, we went to every corner of this great nation.
MasterChef!
The best home cooks in America entered the MasterChef kitchen all united by their passion for food.
You are the top 22.
They were faced with ferocious challenges.
You got 60 guests, the bride and groom, and they're waiting!
Hut!
I need you on the grill!
You're not sorry at all!
I'm not gonna stand here and be abused.
Some wilted under intense pressure.
- I need a medic.
- Medic.
Quick!
You brought us a dish that you didn't make.
- Others rose...
- Whoo!
Growing stronger with every obstacle.
You're playing the game at a high level.
But to crown the best, we had to find the best.
The person leaving MasterChef tonight is Christian.
Cutter.
Leslie.
Now there are only two home cooks remaining.
Tonight, they will do battle head-to-head in the greatest kitchen in America, but only one will survive what they're about to endure.
Only one will become America's next MasterChef.
The first finalist is Elizabeth...
A 31-year-old advertise executive from Brooklyn, New York.
I grew up in the South, and I spent my entire life obsessing over moving to New York.
I work in advertising, and I enjoy my career, but I'm so ready to win MasterChef and change my life.
This is the last apron.
- After a quiet start...
- Congratulations.
Elizabeth soon rose to become one of the most consistent competitors in the MasterChef kitchen.
The winning mystery box dish...
Elizabeth.
From savory to sweet, comfort food to exotic global flavors...
- Whoo!
- Elizabeth mastered them all.
Wow.
This is like taking a trip to Italy.
Elizabeth has made MasterChef history...
The blue team, ladies and gentlemen.
Having never lost a team challenge.
I'm going to turn this finale into the key that unlocks my culinary dreams.
This is the most important day of my life.
She hasn't cooked in a single pressure test.
Tonight, can Elizabeth handle the pressure of this finale?
The only hurdle that stands in Elizabeth's way is Courtney...
A 25-year-old from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
It's very hard for me to talk about this.
I've done things that I'm not proud of.
Not being able to pay my rent,
I make the difficult, embarrassing decision to work in a gentlemen's club.
But cooking is the start of a new beginning.
I'm gonna do something else that I love and have so much passion for.
I want to make my family so proud.
Courtney made her mark when she became the very first home cook to win a white apron.
- Beautifully done.
Great job.
- Thank you.
She impressed us with her sophisticated European flavors and techniques.
You could taste the love that went into that.
As the pressure intensified...
Courtney, I hope you're joking.
I did that.
She began to stumble.
They're salty.
Eh.
I'm sorry, chef.
But she always managed to step back up to the plate.
Amazing.
You definitely got mojo back.
I want to change my life around, and winning this title is what changes everything.
A win tonight would take Courtney's talents to a very different stage.
Elizabeth and Courtney, congratulations on making it here to the MasterChef finale.
And here to cheer you on are all of your past competitors that you beat to get into this finale.
It's been a long time that you've been on this journey with us.
You've sacrificed so much, especially leaving all of your loved ones back home.
Elizabeth, what do you think that they'd say about you right now being here in the finale?
How proud they are of me.
Let's find out exactly what they would say.
Please welcome your family and friends from Brooklyn:
Your husband Ross, your mom Melissa, your brother Seth, your friends Janine, Jess, and Sarah.
Oh, my god.
Melissa, Elizabeth's under immense pressure tonight.
Any words of encouragement?
Cook your ass off.
Courtney, it's been a long time.
How much do you want to see your family?
I want to see my family so bad.
They want to see you even more.
Here they are.
Hey.
Your mom Lisa, your dad Dennis, sister Collette, Connor, your brother, and your other brother Colby.
Oh, my goodness.
Look at you.
Is Cooper here?
Now we're complete, right?
Captain Cooper, any final words of encouragement you'd like to say to your big sister?
Good luck.
Thanks, baby.
You guys are such an inspiration for these two amazing home cooks.
But now it's time to say good-bye and head up to the gallery.
Bye.
Love you.
Overcome adversity.
Love you, baby.
Hey, you are the best.
For tonight's challenge, we want one appetizer, one entree, and one dessert.
Three identical plates of each course,
One for each of us.
After you're done cooking each course, you'll serve your dishes to us in the MasterChef restaurant where we'll taste your dishes and make some very critical decisions.
You'll each have ten minutes in the MasterChef pantry to get everything you need to cook us the best three-course meal of your entire lives.
Your ten minutes in the pantry starts...
Now.
I want Elizabeth to win.
She's an excellent cook.
Unless she screws up,
I'm seeing her win the whole kit and caboodle.
You can't possibly count Courtney out.
Courtney works good under pressure.
Elizabeth is the terminator, and she's gonna shut Courtney down.
She has to.
It is her fate to stop Courtney.
Somebody has to stop Courtney.
If it was my money on the line,
Courtney got it.
Wow.
Here we go.
First up, your appetizer course.
Elizabeth.
I'll be making a grilled octopus with a warm chorizo and chickpea salad.
And Courtney, what will you be making for your appetizer tonight?
I will be making a crispy pig's ear with dandelion and fennel salad and a quail egg.
You'll both have one hour to make us those stunning appetizers.
Ladies, your time starts...
Now.
Come on, ladies!
- Let's go, you guys.
- Whoo!
- Yeah, Courtney!
- Let's go, sis.
Elizabeth should definitely be worried.
I'm not afraid of Elizabeth.
This is my battle to win, and it's go big or go home.
Come on, Elizabeth!
There are no heels in the kitchen anymore.
It's knives, and it's time to do battle.
Let's do this.
Come on, ladies!
In this season's MasterChef finale,
Elizabeth and Courtney are battling it out over a three-course dinner that they'll serve to the judges.
For their appetizers, Courtney's dish features a crispy pig ear salad with fennel and a quail egg, while Elizabeth has chosen to make grilled octopus with fennel, chorizo, and chickpeas.
Looking good.
All right.
This is it... the battle we've all been waiting for.
Elizabeth's appetizer, for instance, tonight...
A delicious-sounding braised octopus.
She's cooking it in the pressure cooker.
If she's off by even five minutes, we could be eating rubber bands.
Courtney is going out of the box.
Courtney made a pig ear.
Seriously, pig's ear salad?
Pig ears are, like, 99 cents a pound.
They used to be dog chews.
If you don't understand how that ear breaks down, you're gonna be left with a mouthful of cartilage.
But if you get that right, and you cook it beautifully, it's gonna be the dish of the night.
She's taking the biggest chances
I've ever seen a finalist take.
- Yeah, Courtney.
- Whoo!
How you doing, Courtney?
Hey.
I'm doing really good.
We've been through so many seasons of MasterChef, we've never seen pigs' ears in a finale.
Are you taking too much of a risk here tonight?
No, I'm sending a strong message.
Elizabeth should be very scared.
Good luck.
I'm excited to try that.
Thank you, chef.
I'm definitely interested in Courtney's menu.
I mean, the pig ear, I think it's a very awesome,
Trendy way to go, but it's definitely a risk.
It's a very hard dish to elevate.
Go, Elizabeth.
- Right, how you feeling?
- Good, chef.
Describe your appetizer.
I'm doing a grilled octopus with a warm chorizo and chickpea salad.
Why octopus?
There's nothing more impressive than that, and I want to start you on a Mediterranean journey.
Pressure cooker.
How you feeling?
- It's always a little bit of a hope and a prayer.
- I know.
You just got to wait for the last minute.
Quickly cleaning it, grilling it, getting it on the plate.
It's dangerous, but I'm gonna do it.
I'm just amazed that you're leaving this to the very last minute because literally 12 minutes to go.
The octopus is not cooked yet.
Courtney started to plate.
Are you running behind?
No, chef, I'm gonna have everything plated and do the octopus at the very last minute.
You are so daring.
Good luck.
Thanks, chef.
I think Elizabeth has the better menu.
The octopus...
now, that's a challenge.
If you nail it, boom, she's a shoo-in.
Oh, god.
Last ten minutes.
Let's go, ladies.
Courtney's strategy is working.
She put the full-court press on Elizabeth, and I think Elizabeth is beginning to buckle under the pressure.
Elizabeth, you've got to move faster.
- Yes, chef.
- Please.
Okay.
Here's the octopus.
Looks good.
90 seconds left, guys.
Let's go.
You've got to start plating, Elizabeth.
This food is very beautiful.
Exciting.
Oh, my god.
Yeah.
Let's go!
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
Hands in the air!
Now, please bring your dishes down to the front.
Thank you.
Courtney, what do you think of Elizabeth's octopus salad?
The plating's a little haphazard, but it's okay.
Elizabeth, what do you think of Courtney's pig's ear salad?
The pig ear maybe looks a little beige.
Well, we will be the judges of that.
Both of you, please follow us into the MasterChef dining room.
Let's go.
It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks.
It's all in the judges' hands now.
Elizabeth, please present your appetizers, thank you.
I'm taking a huge risk with this octopus.
It's not something that I cook at home all the time, but today, in the finale, big risk, big reward.
Elizabeth, describe your dish, please.
This is a grilled octopus with a warm chickpea and chorizo salad with a piquillo pepper and heirloom tomato sauce.
So I was concerned with the octopus in the pressure cooker, but I have to say that this octopus
Looks better than I would have ever imagined.
This is truly an octopus that I can eat with my eyes.
Thank you.
I very much like the grill portion of the octopus, but I think that you may have slightly overcooked the octopus.
But overall, very punchy, very Mediterranean, very, very strong dish.
- Thank you.
- The flavors are great.
I think that it's aggressively spiced and seasoned, which you've always done throughout the competition.
I think that that shows confidence in your cooking.
You know, if we received it in a restaurant,
I think we'd all be pretty happy with it.
Thank you.
Well, visually the dish is so appealing.
When you're using all those spices with those chickpeas, then you got this perfect foundation for that octopus to sit on the top.
Great flavor on the char.
Love that flavor.
Amazed you got it done in that short period of time.
Bold move, difficult to pull off.
You did just that.
Good job.
Thank you, chef.
Courtney, it's time to taste your appetizer, please.
You've got a very high bar to reach.
Courtney, describe your appetizer, please.
A crispy pig's ear over a dandelion and fennel salad with a quail egg and a guajillo chili sauce.
Is a salad with some fried pig ears enough for an appetizer in the biggest cooking competition in the world, is the question that I'm asking myself.
I believe so.
I believe that the dish is well-balanced.
You might believe that.
I'm asking myself that.
- Oh, sorry.
I thought you were...
- I'm not sure.
Is a salad with some fried pig ears enough?
I believe so.
I believe that the dish is well-balanced.
You might believe that.
I'm asking myself that.
- Oh, sorry, I thought you were...
- I'm not sure.
It's a typically Courtney plate.
It's meticulous, but just a little bit soulless.
Well, it's a really assertive, opinionated dish.
The pigs' ears were very good.
Crispy, salty, rich.
You have a great balance between acidity, heat, oil, and it's certainly one of the most well-dressed salads that I've eaten in recent history.
Thank you, sir.
I love the guajillo pepper sauce.
It's explosive, and it goes great with the rich quail egg.
Tastes great.
Thank you.
Visually it looks elegant.
Pig's ear cooked perfectly.
Shocked them, it sort of solidified all the fat.
The way you treated them was brilliant.
You deliver a punch with flavor.
Great job.
Thank you.
Ladies, you are clearly on another level, and we have some very important things to discuss.
Please prep for the entrees.
Thank you very much.
- Yes, sir.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
Thanks, guys.
Thank you.
Wow, I mean, Elizabeth, great octopus.
I mean, the flavor, delicious.
Yes, it was slightly overcooked, but technically, she pulled it off.
Courtney, out of nowhere, picks a pig ear.
It was a bold, bold statement.
- That's as gutsy as it gets.
- Brilliant.
Two more courses yet to come, so there is lots of culinary gamesmanship still to come to this table for us to taste.
Okay, it's time to get started on your entrees.
You will each have 60 minutes to make us the best main course that you have ever made in your entire life.
Your 60 minutes starts...
Now.
How do you follow those appetizers?
Well, that's the thing is, sometimes after the appetizer you have a clear leader.
- Right now, it's neck and neck.
- Neck and neck.
They're at ground zero again.
Come on, Elizabeth.
For my entree, I'm making spiced lamb and quinoa saute with a carrot puree and a mint yogurt sauce.
Serving the judges an overcooked or undercooked rack of lamb is not gonna fly, so I just need to absolutely nail the cook.
- Come on, Courtney.
- Whoo!
For my entree, I'm doing something that's very, very traditional.
I'm making a sumac duck breast with spring vegetables and farro.
- Whoo!
- Elizabeth!
- Right, how you feeling?
- Feeling good, chef.
How you gonna cook the lamb?
I'm gonna sear it off in a pan and then finish it in the oven until it's medium-rare.
Earlier tonight you left things right to the very last minute for the appetizer.
I mean, are you gonna cut yourself a little bit more time across this one?
Yes, I have plenty of time.
This is not like a pressure cooker situation.
I'm in full control of the lamb.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
- Hello, Courtney.
- Hey.
With this duck, do you think that ii gonna be strong enough to go against a lamb?
'Cause a lamb, a Rolls-Royce cut, restaurant...
But you know what?
So are my duck breasts.
And I started with the pig's ear, and because it was so out there, I wanted to do something that was a little bit more familiar.
- Ah, all right.
- All right, good luck.
Hey, Coop, you want to see some fire?
Yeah!
I mean, I can flambe, but I don't need to.
20 minutes to go.
Let's go.
Courtney's duck is out.
Both Courtney and Elizabeth tonight, with these proteins, have the risk of temperature.
If they don't nail that medium-rare, that will certainly sink their dishes.
Gorgeous.
Looks perfect.
Nice, Courtney.
I think the pressure's getting to Elizabeth.
Courtney's already plating, and Elizabeth's lamb is not even cooked yet.
It's still in the oven.
Tonight, I am struggling with timing more than I have any time previously cooking in the MasterChef kitchen, and I think that it's the added pressure of everyone watching and everything that's at stake.
The lamb's out.
All right, do or die.
Here we go.
Beautiful.
Elizabeth, that looks amazing.
That one looks really rare.
Last three minutes.
Unbelievable.
Elizabeth is leaving everything to the last minute
Just like she did with the appetizer.
90 seconds to go.
Come on.
Very cool, Courtney.
Very cool.
Thanks.
- Looks good, Elizabeth.
- Looks good.
- Come on.
Let's go.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
Push, push.
Come on!
Come on, Courtney!
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
Hands in the air!
Way to go, Courtney!
Please bring those stunning entrees down to the front.
Let's go.
Elizabeth, how are you feeling?
Some of my plating was a little rushed at the end, but I think ultimately it looks beautiful.
Courtney, what do you think of Elizabeth's dish?
I think that her lamb looks raw.
Ooh.
No, it's medium-rare.
Please, Elizabeth, Courtney, and the servers, bring those stunning entrees through to the MasterChef restaurant.
Let's go.
Thank you.
Courtney started something, and at this point, the gloves are off.
My dish is about to knock this bitch out.
It's on.
Let's begin tasting the entrees with Elizabeth.
It's a spiced lamb with red quinoa and rainbow chard, a carrot puree, and a mint yogurt tahini sauce.
I do feel, Joe, that you particularly got a dish where the lamb was a little bit under where I intended.
I wanted to serve it to yo a perfect medium-rare.
Well, if you were shooting for a perfect medium-rare, you didn't get there.
Mine's a rare to black and blue.
Gentlemen, shall we?
Most people probably would want their lamb a little bit more cooked.
Mine was definitely rare.
If cooked properly, it could be fantastic, so a little bit of a letdown.
My lamb's cooked perfectly.
That rub on the lamb is absolutely spot-on.
And what you've nailed here was the quinoa.
Combined with the tahini and that yogurt sauce, delicious.
Puree, wonderful.
Good job.
Thank you.
Visually it's a beautiful dish.
I loved the pop of the carrot puree.
Couldn't have seasoned it any better.
I would absolutely order this again
If I was in a restaurant and got it.
It's a knockout.
Really, really smart dish.
Thank you, chef.
Courtney, will you please present us with your entree?
This is a sumac duck breast with spring vegetables and farro garnished with a pea tendril and a chive blossom pickle, and the sauce is a brandy pan sauce with the duck fat.
Visually gorgeous, and I think it tastes as good as it looks.
The duck breast is crispy and bacon-like and really amazing, and the sauce, buttery and rich, but ve concentrated in flavor, so you get a little bit melting on each bite.
Overall, one of the best dishes I think that you've put up.
- Very commendable.
- Thank you.
The farro is delicious.
It's very nutty.
It's concentrated.
The spring vegetables were cooked perfectly.
It has the shallots.
Everything is really spot-on.
You know, it looks like it came out of a restaurant.
I'm a bit of a stickler when it comes to cooking duck, 'cause it's one of the most difficult proteins to nail.
The duck, beautifully done.
Elegance matched with fragrance, matched with great finesse.
Stunning, absolutely stunning.
- Thanks, Courtney.
- Yeah.
Both of you did amazing jobs.
A lot to discuss, so why don't you go ahead and get ready to do those desserts?
Two phenomenal entrees.
Courtney's duck was ambitious and very chef-driven.
It was well-thought out, and execution was perfect.
Elizabeth's lamb tasted delicious.
The flavors that she was working with were great.
The seasoning was right there.
As always, we're looking at the entire menu as a whole, so nobody is gonna win this based on where we're at right now.
We got to see that dessert.
I think that I made some small technical errors, but I'm still here.
Everything is on the line for this dessert course for me.
I got to nail it.
Elizabeth and Courtney, this next course will seal the deal for one of you.
Elizabeth, please describe your final course tonight.
For dessert, I'm making a grapefruit and olive oil cake with a plum trio.
Wow.
Courtney, please.
I'm doing a cherry meringue with salted chocolate and spiced almonds.
Now, what happens during the next 60 minutes will change one of your lives.
Your one hour starts...
Now.
Come on, Courtney.
Courtney's strong.
She's very strong, and she's a baker, so with desserts, she's a force to be reckoned with.
Courtney!
Courtney!
Yeah, Courtney!
Elizabeth is the real deal.
I've watched her.
I've cooked with her.
And her cake's gonna be a winner.
Elizabeth!
So what's the dish, Elizabeth?
It's an olive oil and grapefruit semolina cake, so it almost has, like, that delicious kind of cornbread texture.
Right, love it.
Courtney obviously has a lot to gain by winning this.
She wants this bad.
This is a game changer for her.
You want it as much as she does?
I absolutely want this as much as she does.
Just because I work in an office and not a nightclub does not mean I don't deserve to win this.
Spot on!
Good luck, Elizabeth.
Whoo!
All right, Courtney.
So a meringue.
I mean, any professional chef tonight would be looking at the meringue and saying, "What, in 60 minutes?"
They take literally hours to dry out.
How are you gonna fast-track these?
They're a nice, small size, so they're not gonna need as much time in the oven.
What is it with you that refuses to play safe?
No reason to play it safe, especially when it's something this big.
You just got to go for it.
- Good luck.
- Thank you, chef.
Let's go.
Come on, Courtney.
Come on.
- Yeah!
Come on, Elizabeth.
- Go, Elizabeth!
Here we go.
The cake's out.
My cake is slightly undercooked in the middle.
Oh, her cake looks like a mess over there.
But I have a plan.
to use the outer edge, so it's gonna be perfectly moist.
Not too dry or overbaked, but still cooked and edible.
Good.
I wanted to make sure that the salt content in my meringue is right,
So I take a bite of it...
- How is that, Courtney?
- It's good.
And then I realize I don't have any extra meringues.
I ate one of the judges' meringues.
Uh-oh, something happened.
I'm gonna look like I've given them an incomplete plate.
Oops.
I have just quite possibly eaten $1/4 million.
I ate one of the judges' meringues.
Uh-oh, something happened.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
I have just possibly eaten $1/4 million.
Let's go, ladies.
Last two minutes.
Come on.
Let's go.
That is beautiful.
Whoo!
30 seconds to go.
Come on.
Let's go.
Come on, guys.
Come on.
Whoo!
Looks beautiful!
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
and stop.
Wow.
Well done.
Bring your delicious desserts to the front of the bench.
Elizabeth, what do you think of Courtney's dessert?
I think it looks like second place.
Ooh.
After this tasting, one of you two will be crowned this year's MasterChef.
Let's get it on.
We're gonna bring those desserts into the restaurant.
Courtney, please bring us your dessert.
Thank you.
I made for you a cherry meringue with salted chocolate and spiced almonds.
Did we miss one?
'Cause it looks like three complete piles, and then we each got one empty one.
I was so concerned with how everything tasted together that I ate one of the meringues that needed to be the top to the third.
Let's hope it tastes better than it looks.
Is there salt in anything else other than the chocolate on this plate?
- The cherries.
- Something tastes salty.
- The cherries taste salty?
- Cherries maybe.
I put a little bit of salt into the black cherries just to bring out that flavor of it.
That's either really brilliant or really stupid.
But after eating it and processing it in my mind,
I have to say that I think...
It's brilliant.
Thank you, sir.
It is really elevating the intellectual component of a dessert to another level and making me not only eat it with my palate in my mouth but also digest it with my brain.
It's very intellectually and physically satisfying.
Thank you, sir.
The presentation obviously not what you wanted, but the taste is delicious.
The pastry cream with the vanilla bean going through it and the salted chocolate, all those are great.
The cherries balanced against the sweetness of those almonds, it's like this perfect harmony.
Kind of eye-opening.
I disagree with Joe.
Don't like salty cherries.
They taste like they're in a brine.
Meringues taste delicious.
I'm amazed you got them crisp on the outside, gooey and just right in the center.
Cooked to perfection, nailed them.
Pastry cream delicious.
The flavors are there, the texture's there, but it's just, sadly, your clumsiest plate.
I don't agree.
I apologize for that, chef.
Well...
Thank you.
Elizabeth, please step forward.
This is a grapefruit and olive oil semolina cake soaked in a grapefruit syrup with poached plums and just a little ground pistachio.
The actual olive oil cake I think is delicious.
I love the flavor.
It's got a great texture.
The puree is great.
The spiced pistachio helps balance the sweetness.
A really delicious dish.
Smart choice with this.
Thank you, chef.
Yeah, I'm putting this within the context of being an Italian dessert because my grandmother makes olive oil cake like this.
It's spot-on.
It's delicious.
It's rustic.
The coulis, the poached plums, the cake, the yogurt on top, fantastic.
It's a top-notch dish.
It fires on all cylinders.
Thank you.
Elizabeth, you knew it was undercooked in the center, yet you did the smartest thing, and you cut from the outside of the cake in.
There are professional chefs tonight watching that wouldn't even have the intelligence or the integrity to stand back and readjust, so I just want to commend you on that.
Thank you.
The cake itself, really delicious.
What makes it for me is the pink grapefruit, because that gives it the tartness, cuts the richness, and just really lifts that citrusy indulgence.
- Lovely.
- Thank you.
We now have to make one of the most difficult decisions
We've ever made in this entire competition, a decision that will affect both your lives.
We'll be crowning one of you the new American MasterChef.
Please give us a moment.
Elizabeth's, first off.
The cake was perfect.
- Her best dish of the night.
- Right.
I'm super proud of what I've done today.
100%, my menu's better.
It has more of a connective thread, and I believe my dessert showed the judges that I deserve to win.
But I think that Courtney's dessert really kind of showed her thinking on another level.
Courtney's dessert was the weakest performing dish of our entire finale.
I disagree, 'cause it takes the parameters of what is a dessert and pushes it to the limits, and if we're not here to do that, then I don't know what we're here to do.
I took risks.
I was daring.
I didn't play anything safe, and to me, that's what a MasterChef is.
We judge based on the entire spectrum of this menu.
App, entree, dessert...
Who has the best collection overall?
So Elizabeth's menu.
For the first 2/3 of this competition tonight, her time management was deplorable except for the last 1/3 where she nailed it on the dessert 100%.
Courtney's menu was the opposite.
She did not go on an ethnic or a regional theme.
Her menu was more enlightened cooking and taking risks.
I've never seen two finalists that were in the zone as much as these two.
We are seeing home cooks come through this kitchen who can, will, and should have an impact on how the rest of the world will eat.
So we agree we have a winner?
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Definitely.
Elizabeth and Courtney, you came to this competition as home cooks with a burning passion for food.
Medic.
Oh, my god.
is he all right?
Elizabeth and Courtney, you came with a burning passion for food.
Medic.
- Oh, my god.
- Is he all right?
Find some water, please, quickly.
- Oh, my god.
- Some water.
Get a chair.
Here we go.
Ross, you okay, bud?
- Here we go.
- Honey, are you okay?
There you go.
There's a chair.
Honey, are you okay?
There's a chair behind you.
- Some water, please.
- He went white.
Oh, my god.
I passed out.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Oh, I-I felt like that was gonna happen.
It's okay.
Have some water, sweetie.
We haven't announced the winner yet, okay?
So thanks for staying with us, okay?
- When I pass out, I really pass out.
- Wait for me, bud.
You got to wait for me.
I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry.
- Welcome back.
Good?
- I'm fine.
My husband loves me so much he passed out.
- Take a little sip of water.
- Okay.
- Take your time.
- Oh, my god.
I'm gonna have a heart attack.
But Gordon Ramsay saves the day yet again.
He gives him some water and picks him up and makes sure he's okay.
- You okay?
- I'm good.
Elizabeth and Courtney, we are so proud of the two of you.
This is my fate.
This is my future.
I think today I gave a really winning performance, and I do think I deserve to win.
It's clear that you have both elevated your skill.
I am the epitome of MasterChef.
You're here to change your life.
Yeah, I worked in a gentleman's club.
That's behind me, because now winning this title is what changes everything.
Tonight confirmed that you two are phenomenal chefs, and that's why we'd like you both to come up here and switch places with us.
Our decision wasn't easy.
It came down to the tiniest of details.
That's how close it was this evening.
But as you know, there can only be one winner.
One of you is about to win
$1/4 million.
One of you will go on to publish your very own cookbook.
And one of you will claim this...
The most coveted title in the culinary world,
The title of MasterChef.
America's next great MasterChef is...
Congratulations...
Courtney.
Well done.
Well done.
- Thank you!
- Oh, my god.
I've never given up.
I've been through the wringer.
I've made so many sacrifices, and this validates all of them.
You said I was worthy, daddy.
You're darn right, honey.
This trophy means no more student loans.
My mom gets a kitchen, and I have a secure future in cooking.
Yeah!
Sorry, guys.
Oh, don't say that.
Ugh, why didn't I put the lamb in sooner?
I'd be $250,000 richer.
But you know what, Courtney deserves it.
But I did things that I didn't think I was ever capable of doing.
I'm really proud of myself.
Mwah!
Who's America's next MasterChef?
Courtney!
Salud.
My mom looking at me winning this title means so much to me.
Louder!
I've had highs and lows.
I've come so far, and I've made her and my father and my siblings so proud of me.
- Whoo!
- Whoo!
Wow, what a night.
Now, if you think you've got what it takes to become America's next MasterChef,
I cannot wait to see you.
I am America's MasterChef!
Yeah!
All right, guys, let's get to it.
What's that button?
It's something designed to help you get healthy.
Just ignore it.
So, Patrick, did you take the high road and congratulate Wendy on that promotion that you were supposed to get?
Yes, I did.
I even bought her flowers.
Man's voice:
Liar!
What really happened?
I saw her in the break room and I gave her a thumbs up.
Liar!
I flipped her off, that's all.
Liar!
Okay, I started a whisper campaign behind her back that she has irritable bowel syndrome and that she is the one responsible for the "mystery smell" in the elevator.
There you go.
Was that so hard?
Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt.
I couldn't find any orange juice in there.
I feel like I'm coming down with something.
Dude, you're sick.
You're wearing a parka.
It's like 95 degrees outside.
It's way colder with the wind chill.
I'm out of OJ.
You'll have to go to the grocery store.
That is if you can make it there with all this weather we've been having.
Are you making fun of me?
Are you kidding?
I would never do that.
Liar!
All right, Lacey.
You're up.
What's going on with you?
Not too much.
I got my car repainted.
My ex boyfriend who I shot in the balls is getting married to the woman he cheated on me with tonight.
Oh, and I found some old muscle relaxers under a couch cushion, so that should be fun.
I'm a little concerned about this.
Oh, don't worry.
They may have lost a little strength, but you can always recharge them with vodka.
Lacey, you shot this guy.
You must still have some anger towards him.
He's the whole reason you're here.
I know I'm angry at him that you're here.
Notice Charlie didn't hit the button on that.
It's no big deal.
I never even think about Julio anymore or the way his head would look on a stick.
Really?
And how would his head look on that stick?
Great, because he would be surprised.
He'd be like, "How did you find me here at Tarzana Methodist Church?"
Damn, you look good.
"Ow, you shot me again."
I don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but I think we're on to something important here.
Really?
What's that?
"Smellavator"!
What?
That's what Patrick should call the elevator that the lady smells up.
Somebody should put your head on a stick.
Except it'd be a waste of a good stick.
Lacey, it's clear that you're still really angry at this guy.
And if you go to that wedding, nothing good will come from it.
Don't worry, I'm not going.
Just because Julio cheated on me and completely screwed up my life doesn't mean he doesn't deserve to be happy.
Oh, and that bitch he's marrying,
I hope she's happy, too.
Liar
Hey, you're not a doctor.
Hey, Sean.
Where's Charlie?
I've got the clinic budget for him to look at.
He's in with the group.
Oh, okay.
Will you let him know I stopped by?
Okay.
( Sighs ) Not that I care, but are you okay?
I'm so hot and this tile floor is so cool.
( Sighs )
Oh, my God.
You're burning up.
Oh, if you think my head is hot, you should touch my nipples.
Do it soft at first, but then just kind of slowly lean into it.
Listen, there's a really bad flu going around.
You need to go see a doctor.
Will you take me?
Please?
No.
Come on, I know you like taking care of things.
Charlie told me about the bird that you found with the broken wing.
I didn't find it.
It flew into the house when I was trying to shoo it out the window.
I broke its wing.
That's okay.
You let it live with you, right?
Well... it couldn't fly away and I didn't want to touch it, so I just threw worms at it until it died.
Please, come on, just take me to the doctor.
Or you can throw worms at me until I die.
All right, fine.
- Come on.
- Oh.
( Knocks )
- Lacey:
Who is it?
- It's Charlie.
Look, I know tonight's Julio's wedding.
I just want to make sure you're not planning anything crazy.
I'm not going to the wedding.
I'm going to my niece's birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese, so please leave.
I'm not leaving till you open this door.
Fine.
Chuck E. Cheese, huh?
Yeah, it's a new one with bottle service.
They're trying something.
We're gonna talk.
I don't know what there is to talk about, Charlie.
You're going to that wedding.
Somebody's probably gonna get hurt and you'll go to jail.
But maybe if you showed the judge a picture of this place, you could get off pleading insanity.
You're being ridiculous.
I'm going to Chuck E. Cheese.
So the gun's in case you want to jump the line at Skee-Ball?
Charlie, I can explain.
I'm listening.
The gun is in case I want to jump the line at Dance Dance Revolution, which is my jam.
You're not going to that wedding.
Yes, I am.
Julio doesn't deserve to get married and be happy while I sit around in this shoebox with a stoner watching me take a shower through a hole in the wall.
Nolan does that?
And the guy on the other side, too.
Lacey, you already shot Julio once and it didn't give you any satisfaction then.
- Yes, it did.
- Well, not a lot.
- Yes, it did.
- Don't argue with me.
I'm your therapist and I'm telling you you're not satisfied.
Exactly, which is why I want to shoot his other ball off.
This bastard is about to have everything.
He is the lowest scum on earth and someone loves him.
Nobody loves me.
What does that make me?
Lacey, lots of people love you.
But nobody is in love with me.
Now, I'm going to that wedding and nothing you can say will stop me.
I'm in love with you.
What?
It's true.
It's been building up for so long,
I didn't know how to tell you or if you didn't believe me...
I guess you believe me.
My therapist loves me, just like in all the songs.
Anger Management 2x58
- Charlie Spends the Night with Lacey - Original air date April 24, 2014
Can I... can I have this?
Call me old-fashioned, but I'm just not as turned on by gunplay as I used to be.
You know, deep down,
I knew you always loved me.
All those times I was hitting on you and you had to pretend like you weren't into it and you were all like, "I'm your therapist."
"I'll lose my license."
Right, my license.
I have a confession to make.
Sometimes in therapy, I'm not even listening.
I'm shocked.
I'm just fantasizing about us.
I hope that's not what Ed's doing when he's not listening.
( Laughs )
Look at us, just laughing together at the other people in the group.
We're so above them now.
( Knocking )
- Who is it?
- It's me, Nolan.
From next door and your therapy group.
And from knocking on the door right now.
- Should we tell him?
- No, no.
It'll really hurt him.
( Sighs )
Hey, Nolan.
What's going on?
I heard everything through one of the holes I made in the wall.
Can we tell him now?
I don't think we have to.
Forget it, Charlie.
I'm not gonna stay here and let you use your therapy mind control to make me believe this is something it's not because I'll fall for it.
I'm leaving!
I'll go talk to him.
No, don't.
This is our night.
He's gonna be fine.
In a couple minutes he'll be high and playing video games and his friends Mario and Luigi will get him through this.
But I need to tell him how beautiful our love is and how much it means to me.
It'll take, like, 30 seconds.
Sure, go over there because everyone's emotional distress is more important than mine.
( Crying )
Okay, fine, I'll stay.
I'll stay.
Hey, our first fight.
You know what this means?
Makeup sex.
As your mental health professional,
I'm happy to say that you are in peak physical condition.
Jordan!
( Sighs ) What is it now?
I'm out of apple juice.
Did you finish your chicken noodle soup?
I don't like chicken and noodles.
I like chicken and stars.
The stars and the noodles are made from the same thing.
But why do the stars taste so much better?
I can't believe I have to have you at my house.
I didn't ask to come over here, okay?
The doctor said someone needed to take care of me.
( Groans )
I really appreciate that you're doing this.
I know I can be a pain in the ass.
You're not a pain in the ass.
In fact, you're a lot less disgusting when you're sick.
That's what my mom always said.
Can I get another blanket?
Oh, look, it's got horsies.
Now, get some sleep while I try to find a very tiny knife and cut your noodles into stars.
Thank you.
You know, you're like a little Florence Henderson.
Nightingale?
Henderson.
The mom from "The Brady Bunch."
She took care of all those kids.
Half of them weren't even hers.
You know, I think she was banging one of them when the cameras were off.
Good night.
( Sneezes )
Bless you.
( Sneezes )
Ugh, you're getting it all over the room.
( Sneezes )
Oh, crap.
You know, I'm still waiting on those stars.
I don't understand.
Why do you want to wait before we have sex?
- You said you loved me.
- I do.
But I also like romance.
You know, holding hands, long walks on the beach.
You know, stuff on the beach with hands.
We should do all that right after we screw each other's brains out.
Sorry.
I mean make love each other's brains out.
I know you like romance.
Okay.
Okay, look.
I do like romance, but I want to do this right.
Like, do you have any massage oils?
Oh, yeah.
Not the regular ones.
The ones that heat up.
- 'Cause I got to have that.
- Oh, yup.
Got it.
Okay, good, good.
Good, good, good.
What about condoms?
I forgot condoms.
Don't worry, I've got some.
- Ribbed for your pleasure?
- Yes.
- Ribbed on the inside for mine?
- Yes.
They have those?
I just turn them inside out.
Smart.
Ah, flavored.
I insist on being considerate.
I got it.
- Cherry?
- Yes.
- Chocolate?
- Yes.
Mocha Frappuccino?
No.
Well, then how in the hell are we supposed to have sex?
( Knocking ) Patrick:
Let us in.
It's Patrick, Nolan, and Ed.
- Go away.
- No, it's fine.
I got this.
It's the perfect time to explain that this is not going to affect the group.
Good luck.
They're not gonna like it now that I'm the queen of therapy and can tell them to shut up whenever I want.
Yeah, I'll deal with that and you go get dressed.
Okay.
Shut up, everybody!
Well, well, well.
Looks like somebody's been dipping his company pen in the India ink.
I told you.
Is she gonna get to be queen of the group now and tell us all to shut up?
Because if she is...
I don't even know.
No, she's not the queen.
We're not in love.
I'm just pretending to keep her away from that wedding.
Just one more hour.
Play along, guys.
Explain again.
Not clear.
Still confused.
I will explain it to her in a little bit, but for now, just pretend like you're cool with everything and she'll buy it.
Did you tell them about us, Charlie?
- Oh, yeah, congratulations.
- So happy for you.
Thank you.
That means so much to me.
Hey, she bought it!
Bought it?
You lying bastard.
Lacey, I never meant to hurt you.
And clearly I forgot to factor in that Nolan is always high.
What are you worried about?
She bought it.
I got to be careful with the cough syrup.
I'm in recovery.
You already drank half the bottle.
It was good.
( Laughs )
A delightful generic 2014 from the rolling estates of DrugCo Pharmaceuticals.
Mmm.
Well... can I interest you in an after-dinner expectorant, my dear?
You know, Sean, this may be the drugs talking, but...
"Hello, I'm the drugs!"
( Laughs )
( Laughs )
I think my fever broke.
Why do you think that?
Because I am covered in sweat.
Maybe that's because you're sitting next to me.
Then why are you covered in sweat?
Because I am in me.
Shut up and feel my head.
You know, I never noticed this before, but your skin is very clammy.
And your eyes are so... red and watery.
If I throw up on you, don't take it personally.
I never do.
I can't believe you made me think that you loved me.
How could you do that to me?
Lacey, I'm so sorry.
I was desperate.
I was trying to save you from yourself.
I didn't need to be saved.
Even if I got caught, I wasn't going to jail.
Juries love me.
You saw my boobs.
I did.
They're very persuasive.
But I think we've moved beyond a boob-based justice system.
Now it's more about money and racial discrimination.
Oh, my God.
I feel like such a fool.
I threw myself at you.
You saw me naked.
I had no idea that was gonna happen.
And by the way, you get naked way too quick, and that's coming from me.
You know what?
Despite what you think,
I do not get naked in front of men that easy.
Now I could never sit across from you in therapy.
Oh, Lacey, please don't quit.
After all my help tonight, you're gonna need a lot of therapy.
What can I do to make you more comfortable in group?
I can only think of one thing.
Anything.
Get naked in front of me.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Everything... pants to the ground.
That's the only thing that'll put us back on equal footing.
If that's what it's gonna take.
This is worth it, 'cause at least you didn't go to that church and do something stupid.
Like you just did?
Pretty much.
- Ah.
- Oh, my God.
What did we just do?
Didn't your parents ever explain it to you?
Because I can walk you through it again very slowly with a pointer.
This is terrible.
Don't act like you didn't have a good time.
No, I loved it.
That's why it's so terrible.
Baby, stop denying what you're feeling.
You don't know what I'm feeling.
You didn't sleep with you.
The only reason this happened was because I was half crazy off of cough medicine and delusional from having an insanely high fever, which right now is 102.
That's still three degrees till I know what I'm doing.
Let's go.
Lacey, stop.
You don't want to go in there and ruin that wedding.
Just because I'm gonna bash in Julio's face with a tire iron doesn't mean that people still can't hang around and have a good time.
I think it does.
It puts a damper on the festivities.
At the very least, it changes the vibe.
- You don't know what he did, Charlie.
- He cheated on you.
You shot his ball off.
Why ruin his wedding?
You're already sending him off on a one-ball honeymoon.
It was worse than that.
Way worse, okay?
You don't understand.
Make me understand.
He hit me, okay?
And no one should ever hit anybody.
So if you mention this in group,
I swear to God, I will beat you within an inch of your life.
Why didn't you tell me so I could help you with this?
Because I didn't want to create a lot of drama, okay?
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going into that wedding to beat this man in front of God and everyone he knows.
Give me the tire iron.
Okay, good, you hit him with that.
I'll find something else.
Lacey, wait.
I know you'd love to kick his ass, but what I think you need to do is forgive him.
Forgive him?
- Give me back my tire iron.
- No.
This isn't for him.
This is for you.
Until you forgive him and let this go, you're never gonna have any peace of mind.
- Then we might as well go home.
- No.
Don't you know the best time to forgive somebody for a lot of horrible things?
Right in the middle of their wedding.
Julio!
Don't worry, I just came to forgive you.
I forgive you for cheating on me with that ho.
I also forgive you for taking the money
I gave you for your dog's surgery and using it to buy breast implants for that ho.
No, not the bride ho.
The maid of honor ho.
I also forgive you for posting those horrible naked photos of me online when you knew there were a lot of really good ones to choose from.
I forgive you for listening to me when I told you to take ecstasy and make love to your friend Todd.
It wasn't a turn-on for me after all.
Hey, Todd.
But mostly, I forgive you for being a heartless bastard who wasted two years of my life.
And I wish nothing but the best for your bride.
By the way, girlfriend, watch out when he comes home drunk.
He likes to lead with his left.
Oh, yeah, he won't use his right hand.
That's his porn hand.
He likes the granny stuff.
Wow.
So, do you feel better?
Yeah.
Forgiveness is amazing.
I should totally forgive my mother for all the crap she did to me when I was a child.
Oh, she's being honored at a charity luncheon tomorrow.
- I'll do it there.
- You know what?
You know what?
I think we've had enough forgiveness for one week.
Yeah, maybe you're right.
By any chance, is she having a big birthday party anytime soon?
'Cause invite me.
I'd like to see that, too.
All right, guys, let's get to it.
What's that button?
It's something designed to help you get healthy.
Just ignore it.
So, Patrick, did you take the high road and congratulate Wendy on that promotion that you were supposed to get?
Yes, I did.
I even bought her flowers.
Man's voice:
Liar!
What really happened?
I saw her in the break room and I gave her a thumbs up.
Liar!
I flipped her off, that's all.
Liar!
Okay, I started a whisper campaign behind her back that she has irritable bowel syndrome and that she is the one responsible for the "mystery smell" in the elevator.
There you go.
Was that so hard?
Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt.
I couldn't find any orange juice in there.
I feel like I'm coming down with something.
Dude, you're sick.
You're wearing a parka.
It's like 95 degrees outside.
It's way colder with the wind chill.
I'm out of OJ.
You'll have to go to the grocery store.
That is if you can make it there with all this weather we've been having.
Are you making fun of me?
Are you kidding?
I would never do that.
Liar!
All right, Lacey.
You're up.
What's going on with you?
Not too much.
I got my car repainted.
My ex boyfriend who I shot in the balls is getting married to the woman he cheated on me with tonight.
Oh, and I found some old muscle relaxers under a couch cushion, so that should be fun.
I'm a little concerned about this.
Oh, don't worry.
They may have lost a little strength, but you can always recharge them with vodka.
Lacey, you shot this guy.
You must still have some anger towards him.
He's the whole reason you're here.
I know I'm angry at him that you're here.
Notice Charlie didn't hit the button on that.
It's no big deal.
I never even think about Julio anymore or the way his head would look on a stick.
Really?
And how would his head look on that stick?
Great, because he would be surprised.
He'd be like, "How did you find me here at Tarzana Methodist Church?"
Damn, you look good.
"Ow, you shot me again."
I don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but I think we're on to something important here.
Really?
What's that?
"Smellavator"!
What?
That's what Patrick should call the elevator that the lady smells up.
Somebody should put your head on a stick.
Except it'd be a waste of a good stick.
Lacey, it's clear that you're still really angry at this guy.
And if you go to that wedding, nothing good will come from it.
Don't worry, I'm not going.
Just because Julio cheated on me and completely screwed up my life doesn't mean he doesn't deserve to be happy.
Oh, and that bitch he's marrying,
I hope she's happy, too.
Liar
Hey, you're not a doctor.
Hey, Sean.
Where's Charlie?
I've got the clinic budget for him to look at.
He's in with the group.
Oh, okay.
Will you let him know I stopped by?
Okay.
( Sighs ) Not that I care, but are you okay?
I'm so hot and this tile floor is so cool.
( Sighs )
Oh, my God.
You're burning up.
Oh, if you think my head is hot, you should touch my nipples.
Do it soft at first, but then just kind of slowly lean into it.
Listen, there's a really bad flu going around.
You need to go see a doctor.
Will you take me?
Please?
No.
Come on, I know you like taking care of things.
Charlie told me about the bird that you found with the broken wing.
I didn't find it.
It flew into the house when I was trying to shoo it out the window.
I broke its wing.
That's okay.
You let it live with you, right?
Well... it couldn't fly away and I didn't want to touch it, so I just threw worms at it until it died.
Please, come on, just take me to the doctor.
Or you can throw worms at me until I die.
All right, fine.
- Come on.
- Oh.
( Knocks )
- Lacey:
Who is it?
- It's Charlie.
Look, I know tonight's Julio's wedding.
I just want to make sure you're not planning anything crazy.
I'm not going to the wedding.
I'm going to my niece's birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese, so please leave.
I'm not leaving till you open this door.
Fine.
Chuck E. Cheese, huh?
Yeah, it's a new one with bottle service.
They're trying something.
We're gonna talk.
I don't know what there is to talk about, Charlie.
You're going to that wedding.
Somebody's probably gonna get hurt and you'll go to jail.
But maybe if you showed the judge a picture of this place, you could get off pleading insanity.
You're being ridiculous.
I'm going to Chuck E. Cheese.
So the gun's in case you want to jump the line at Skee-Ball?
Charlie, I can explain.
I'm listening.
The gun is in case I want to jump the line at Dance Dance Revolution, which is my jam.
You're not going to that wedding.
Yes, I am.
Julio doesn't deserve to get married and be happy while I sit around in this shoebox with a stoner watching me take a shower through a hole in the wall.
Nolan does that?
And the guy on the other side, too.
Lacey, you already shot Julio once and it didn't give you any satisfaction then.
- Yes, it did.
- Well, not a lot.
- Yes, it did.
- Don't argue with me.
I'm your therapist and I'm telling you you're not satisfied.
Exactly, which is why I want to shoot his other ball off.
This bastard is about to have everything.
He is the lowest scum on earth and someone loves him.
Nobody loves me.
What does that make me?
Lacey, lots of people love you.
But nobody is in love with me.
Now, I'm going to that wedding and nothing you can say will stop me.
I'm in love with you.
What?
It's true.
It's been building up for so long,
I didn't know how to tell you or if you didn't believe me...
I guess you believe me.
My therapist loves me, just like in all the songs.
Anger Management 2x58
- Charlie Spends the Night with Lacey - Original air date April 24, 2014
Can I... can I have this?
Call me old-fashioned, but I'm just not as turned on by gunplay as I used to be.
You know, deep down,
I knew you always loved me.
All those times I was hitting on you and you had to pretend like you weren't into it and you were all like, "I'm your therapist."
"I'll lose my license."
Right, my license.
I have a confession to make.
Sometimes in therapy, I'm not even listening.
I'm shocked.
I'm just fantasizing about us.
I hope that's not what Ed's doing when he's not listening.
( Laughs )
Look at us, just laughing together at the other people in the group.
We're so above them now.
( Knocking )
- Who is it?
- It's me, Nolan.
From next door and your therapy group.
And from knocking on the door right now.
- Should we tell him?
- No, no.
It'll really hurt him.
( Sighs )
Hey, Nolan.
What's going on?
I heard everything through one of the holes I made in the wall.
Can we tell him now?
I don't think we have to.
Forget it, Charlie.
I'm not gonna stay here and let you use your therapy mind control to make me believe this is something it's not because I'll fall for it.
I'm leaving!
I'll go talk to him.
No, don't.
This is our night.
He's gonna be fine.
In a couple minutes he'll be high and playing video games and his friends Mario and Luigi will get him through this.
But I need to tell him how beautiful our love is and how much it means to me.
It'll take, like, 30 seconds.
Sure, go over there because everyone's emotional distress is more important than mine.
( Crying )
Okay, fine, I'll stay.
I'll stay.
Hey, our first fight.
You know what this means?
Makeup sex.
As your mental health professional,
I'm happy to say that you are in peak physical condition.
Jordan!
( Sighs ) What is it now?
I'm out of apple juice.
Did you finish your chicken noodle soup?
I don't like chicken and noodles.
I like chicken and stars.
The stars and the noodles are made from the same thing.
But why do the stars taste so much better?
I can't believe I have to have you at my house.
I didn't ask to come over here, okay?
The doctor said someone needed to take care of me.
( Groans )
I really appreciate that you're doing this.
I know I can be a pain in the ass.
You're not a pain in the ass.
In fact, you're a lot less disgusting when you're sick.
That's what my mom always said.
Can I get another blanket?
Oh, look, it's got horsies.
Now, get some sleep while I try to find a very tiny knife and cut your noodles into stars.
Thank you.
You know, you're like a little Florence Henderson.
Nightingale?
Henderson.
The mom from "The Brady Bunch."
She took care of all those kids.
Half of them weren't even hers.
You know, I think she was banging one of them when the cameras were off.
Good night.
( Sneezes )
Bless you.
( Sneezes )
Ugh, you're getting it all over the room.
( Sneezes )
Oh, crap.
You know, I'm still waiting on those stars.
I don't understand.
Why do you want to wait before we have sex?
- You said you loved me.
- I do.
But I also like romance.
You know, holding hands, long walks on the beach.
You know, stuff on the beach with hands.
We should do all that right after we screw each other's brains out.
Sorry.
I mean make love each other's brains out.
I know you like romance.
Okay.
Okay, look.
I do like romance, but I want to do this right.
Like, do you have any massage oils?
Oh, yeah.
Not the regular ones.
The ones that heat up.
- 'Cause I got to have that.
- Oh, yup.
Got it.
Okay, good, good.
Good, good, good.
What about condoms?
I forgot condoms.
Don't worry, I've got some.
- Ribbed for your pleasure?
- Yes.
- Ribbed on the inside for mine?
- Yes.
They have those?
I just turn them inside out.
Smart.
Ah, flavored.
I insist on being considerate.
I got it.
- Cherry?
- Yes.
- Chocolate?
- Yes.
Mocha Frappuccino?
No.
Well, then how in the hell are we supposed to have sex?
( Knocking ) Patrick:
Let us in.
It's Patrick, Nolan, and Ed.
- Go away.
- No, it's fine.
I got this.
It's the perfect time to explain that this is not going to affect the group.
Good luck.
They're not gonna like it now that I'm the queen of therapy and can tell them to shut up whenever I want.
Yeah, I'll deal with that and you go get dressed.
Okay.
Shut up, everybody!
Well, well, well.
Looks like somebody's been dipping his company pen in the India ink.
I told you.
Is she gonna get to be queen of the group now and tell us all to shut up?
Because if she is...
I don't even know.
No, she's not the queen.
We're not in love.
I'm just pretending to keep her away from that wedding.
Just one more hour.
Play along, guys.
Explain again.
Not clear.
Still confused.
I will explain it to her in a little bit, but for now, just pretend like you're cool with everything and she'll buy it.
Did you tell them about us, Charlie?
- Oh, yeah, congratulations.
- So happy for you.
Thank you.
That means so much to me.
Hey, she bought it!
Bought it?
You lying bastard.
Lacey, I never meant to hurt you.
And clearly I forgot to factor in that Nolan is always high.
What are you worried about?
She bought it.
I got to be careful with the cough syrup.
I'm in recovery.
You already drank half the bottle.
It was good.
( Laughs )
A delightful generic 2014 from the rolling estates of DrugCo Pharmaceuticals.
Mmm.
Well... can I interest you in an after-dinner expectorant, my dear?
You know, Sean, this may be the drugs talking, but...
"Hello, I'm the drugs!"
( Laughs )
( Laughs )
I think my fever broke.
Why do you think that?
Because I am covered in sweat.
Maybe that's because you're sitting next to me.
Then why are you covered in sweat?
Because I am in me.
Shut up and feel my head.
You know, I never noticed this before, but your skin is very clammy.
And your eyes are so... red and watery.
If I throw up on you, don't take it personally.
I never do.
I can't believe you made me think that you loved me.
How could you do that to me?
Lacey, I'm so sorry.
I was desperate.
I was trying to save you from yourself.
I didn't need to be saved.
Even if I got caught, I wasn't going to jail.
Juries love me.
You saw my boobs.
I did.
They're very persuasive.
But I think we've moved beyond a boob-based justice system.
Now it's more about money and racial discrimination.
Oh, my God.
I feel like such a fool.
I threw myself at you.
You saw me naked.
I had no idea that was gonna happen.
And by the way, you get naked way too quick, and that's coming from me.
You know what?
Despite what you think,
I do not get naked in front of men that easy.
Now I could never sit across from you in therapy.
Oh, Lacey, please don't quit.
After all my help tonight, you're gonna need a lot of therapy.
What can I do to make you more comfortable in group?
I can only think of one thing.
Anything.
Get naked in front of me.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Everything... pants to the ground.
That's the only thing that'll put us back on equal footing.
If that's what it's gonna take.
This is worth it, 'cause at least you didn't go to that church and do something stupid.
Like you just did?
Pretty much.
- Ah.
- Oh, my God.
What did we just do?
Didn't your parents ever explain it to you?
Because I can walk you through it again very slowly with a pointer.
This is terrible.
Don't act like you didn't have a good time.
No, I loved it.
That's why it's so terrible.
Baby, stop denying what you're feeling.
You don't know what I'm feeling.
You didn't sleep with you.
The only reason this happened was because I was half crazy off of cough medicine and delusional from having an insanely high fever, which right now is 102.
That's still three degrees till I know what I'm doing.
Let's go.
Lacey, stop.
You don't want to go in there and ruin that wedding.
Just because I'm gonna bash in Julio's face with a tire iron doesn't mean that people still can't hang around and have a good time.
I think it does.
It puts a damper on the festivities.
At the very least, it changes the vibe.
- You don't know what he did, Charlie.
- He cheated on you.
You shot his ball off.
Why ruin his wedding?
You're already sending him off on a one-ball honeymoon.
It was worse than that.
Way worse, okay?
You don't understand.
Make me understand.
He hit me, okay?
And no one should ever hit anybody.
So if you mention this in group,
I swear to God, I will beat you within an inch of your life.
Why didn't you tell me so I could help you with this?
Because I didn't want to create a lot of drama, okay?
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going into that wedding to beat this man in front of God and everyone he knows.
Give me the tire iron.
Okay, good, you hit him with that.
I'll find something else.
Lacey, wait.
I know you'd love to kick his ass, but what I think you need to do is forgive him.
Forgive him?
- Give me back my tire iron.
- No.
This isn't for him.
This is for you.
Until you forgive him and let this go, you're never gonna have any peace of mind.
- Then we might as well go home.
- No.
Don't you know the best time to forgive somebody for a lot of horrible things?
Right in the middle of their wedding.
Julio!
Don't worry, I just came to forgive you.
I forgive you for cheating on me with that ho.
I also forgive you for taking the money
I gave you for your dog's surgery and using it to buy breast implants for that ho.
No, not the bride ho.
The maid of honor ho.
I also forgive you for posting those horrible naked photos of me online when you knew there were a lot of really good ones to choose from.
I forgive you for listening to me when I told you to take ecstasy and make love to your friend Todd.
It wasn't a turn-on for me after all.
Hey, Todd.
But mostly, I forgive you for being a heartless bastard who wasted two years of my life.
And I wish nothing but the best for your bride.
By the way, girlfriend, watch out when he comes home drunk.
He likes to lead with his left.
Oh, yeah, he won't use his right hand.
That's his porn hand.
He likes the granny stuff.
Wow.
So, do you feel better?
Yeah.
Forgiveness is amazing.
I should totally forgive my mother for all the crap she did to me when I was a child.
Oh, she's being honored at a charity luncheon tomorrow.
- I'll do it there.
- You know what?
You know what?
I think we've had enough forgiveness for one week.
Yeah, maybe you're right.
By any chance, is she having a big birthday party anytime soon?
'Cause invite me.
I'd like to see that, too.
All right, guys, let's get to it.
What's that button?
It's something designed to help you get healthy.
Just ignore it.
So, Patrick, did you take the high road and congratulate Wendy on that promotion that you were supposed to get?

Well, then how in the hell are we supposed to have sex?
Let us in.
It's Patrick, Nolan, and Ed.
- Go away.
- No, it's fine.
I got this.
It's the perfect time to explain that this is not going to affect the group.
Good luck.
They're not gonna like it now that I'm the queen of therapy and can tell them to shut up whenever I want.
Yeah, I'll deal with that and you go get dressed.
Okay.
Shut up, everybody!
Well, well, well.
Looks like somebody's been dipping his company pen in the India ink.
I told you.
Is she gonna get to be queen of the group now and tell us all to shut up?
Because if she is...
I don't even know.
No, she's not the queen.
We're not in love.
I'm just pretending to keep her away from that wedding.
Just one more hour.
Play along, guys.
Explain again.
Not clear.
Still confused.
I will explain it to her in a little bit, but for now, just pretend like you're cool with everything and she'll buy it.
Did you tell them about us, Charlie?
- Oh, yeah, congratulations.
- So happy for you.
Thank you.
That means so much to me.
Hey, she bought it!
Bought it?
You lying bastard.
Lacey, I never meant to hurt you.
And clearly I forgot to factor in that Nolan is always high.
What are you worried about?
She bought it.
I got to be careful with the cough syrup.
I'm in recovery.
You already drank half the bottle.
It was good.
A delightful generic 2014 from the rolling estates of DrugCo Pharmaceuticals.
Mmm.
Well... can I interest you in an after-dinner expectorant, my dear?
You know, Sean, this may be the drugs talking, but...
"Hello, I'm the drugs!"
I think my fever broke.
Why do you think that?
Because I am covered in sweat.
Maybe that's because you're sitting next to me.
Then why are you covered in sweat?
Because I am in me.
Shut up and feel my head.
You know, I never noticed this before, but your skin is very clammy.
And your eyes are so... red and watery.
If I throw up on you, don't take it personally.
I never do.
I can't believe you made me think that you loved me.
How could you do that to me?
Lacey, I'm so sorry.
I was desperate.
I was trying to save you from yourself.
I didn't need to be saved.
Even if I got caught, I wasn't going to jail.
Juries love me.
You saw my boobs.
I did.
They're very persuasive.
But I think we've moved beyond a boob-based justice system.
Now it's more about money and racial discrimination.
Oh, my God.
I feel like such a fool.
I threw myself at you.
You saw me naked.
I had no idea that was gonna happen.
And by the way, you get naked way too quick, and that's coming from me.
You know what?
Despite what you think,
I do not get naked in front of men that easy.
Now I could never sit across from you in therapy.
Oh, Lacey, please don't quit.
After all my help tonight, you're gonna need a lot of therapy.
What can I do to make you more comfortable in group?
I can only think of one thing.
Anything.
Get naked in front of me.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Everything... pants to the ground.
That's the only thing that'll put us back on equal footing.
If that's what it's gonna take.
This is worth it, 'cause at least you didn't go to that church and do something stupid.
Like you just did?
Pretty much.
- Ah.
- Oh, my God.
What did we just do?
Didn't your parents ever explain it to you?
Because I can walk you through it again very slowly with a pointer.
This is terrible.
Don't act like you didn't have a good time.
No, I loved it.
That's why it's so terrible.
Baby, stop denying what you're feeling.
You don't know what I'm feeling.
You didn't sleep with you.
The only reason this happened was because I was half crazy off of cough medicine and delusional from having an insanely high fever, which right now is 102.
That's still three degrees till I know what I'm doing.
Let's go.
Lacey, stop.
You don't want to go in there and ruin that wedding.
Just because I'm gonna bash in Julio's face with a tire iron doesn't mean that people still can't hang around and have a good time.
I think it does.
It puts a damper on the festivities.
At the very least, it changes the vibe.
- You don't know what he did, Charlie.
- He cheated on you.
You shot his ball off.
Why ruin his wedding?
You're already sending him off on a one-ball honeymoon.
It was worse than that.
Way worse, okay?
You don't understand.
Make me understand.
He hit me, okay?
And no one should ever hit anybody.
So if you mention this in group,
I swear to God, I will beat you within an inch of your life.
Why didn't you tell me so I could help you with this?
Because I didn't want to create a lot of drama, okay?
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going into that wedding to beat this man in front of God and everyone he knows.
Give me the tire iron.
Okay, good, you hit him with that.
I'll find something else.
Lacey, wait.
I know you'd love to kick his ass, but what I think you need to do is forgive him.
Forgive him?
- Give me back my tire iron.
- No.
This isn't for him.
This is for you.
Until you forgive him and let this go, you're never gonna have any peace of mind.
- Then we might as well go home.
- No.
Don't you know the best time to forgive somebody for a lot of horrible things?
Right in the middle of their wedding.
Julio!
Don't worry, I just came to forgive you.
I forgive you for cheating on me with that ho.
I also forgive you for taking the money
I gave you for your dog's surgery and using it to buy breast implants for that ho.
No, not the bride ho.
The maid of honor ho.
I also forgive you for posting those horrible naked photos of me online when you knew there were a lot of really good ones to choose from.
I forgive you for listening to me when I told you to take ecstasy and make love to your friend Todd.
It wasn't a turn-on for me after all.
Hey, Todd.
But mostly, I forgive you for being a heartless bastard who wasted two years of my life.
And I wish nothing but the best for your bride.
By the way, girlfriend, watch out when he comes home drunk.
He likes to lead with his left.
Oh, yeah, he won't use his right hand.
That's his porn hand.
He likes the granny stuff.
Wow.
So, do you feel better?
Yeah.
Forgiveness is amazing.
I should totally forgive my mother for all the crap she did to me when I was a child.
Oh, she's being honored at a charity luncheon tomorrow.
- I'll do it there.
- You know what?
You know what?
I think we've had enough forgiveness for one week.
Yeah, maybe you're right.
By any chance, is she having a big birthday party anytime soon?
'Cause invite me.
I'd like to see that, too.

Astor?
- Hi.
- Hey.
You wanted to, um, talk about Mila.
We broke up yesterday.
You were dating her?
Um...
I want you to help me get her back.
Oh, Mila and I aren't friends anymore.
- That's okay.
- She hasn't changed at all.
Oh, well, you're probably better off, then.
She was never interested in people for the right reasons, anyway.
Yeah.
Look, Mila wants a ladies man, confident guy who gets all the girls.
It's not you, is it?
I could learn.
Uh...
You could teach me.
I just need techniques that work.
4:00?
3 past.
Would you like to grab a coffee?
You had to ask the time before you knew you wanted to ask me out?
Asking the time was my in.
I couldn't hit on you straight up.
- Well, you should've asked straight up.
- It shows confidence.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Let's go again.
Hey, what's up, girl?
Want to roll with me, get some coffee?
Yeah, I want to roll with you, right off my feet off the sidewalk and into the gutter.
- Let's do it.
- Ain't happening.
You're putting on a persona.
Are you an actor?
- No.
- Then why are you acting up now?
Hold the bus.
12:00.
May not be possible.
10:00, 11:00, stop thinking with your cock.
What are you hesitating for?
Go.
- I can't run after her.
- That's desperate.
You said never look desperate.
You know the deal.
Go now.
- Ah...
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
Um, sorry, uh, can I ask you a question?
Sure, spit it out.
- Oh, that's charming.
- Prince charming.
- Well, what's the question?
- Can I buy you a coffee?
Uh, how long is this question you have to ask me over a cup of coffee?
That's the question.
I don't even know you.
I thought you were, I don't know, doing some environmental survey or something.
No, I'm just a boy asking a girl for a coffee.
- See that machine in there...
- Coffee is only $1.
Yeah.
Go get high.
- Congratulations.
- Your first win.
If I was begging.
Asking a random cutie straight up at this stage was guaranteed to get you knocked back.
- That was the plan.
- An evil plan.
To get you used to being knocked back.
Didn't hurt much, did it?
Hurt like a paper cut on my eyelid.
No pain, no game.
So you're saying I got game?
You're playing the game.
You haven't got game.
- But I be a player, yo.
- All in good time.
Right now, you pay to play.
You got the money?
I have to pay you?
No, I was just being silly, but seriously, can I borrow $20?
Here you are, sir.
- Hey, you idiot.
- What?
- Oh!
Oh!
I-I-I-I...
- What is this?
What am I supposed to do with this?
- I-I-I-I'm sorry.
- I didn't know.
I didn't... you should... but buy your... buy another soda.
Buy yourself a soda.
Okay.
- Sorry, is my son bothering you?
- Come on, Astor.
- Idiot.
- Very sorry.
So, how did you and Mila get together?
Well, let me tell you about it.
Must've been the mixing drinks.
Sambuca and bloody Marys don't really go well to-together.
- Just one more cabernet.

- That's my boob.
Yeah.
You all right?
You love me.
You're the best.
No one loves me like you love me.
I love you, too, Mila.
Mm.
Cold.
It's cold in your house.
I just puked in my mouth.
I told you to go easy.
It's not the liquor.
It's your sob childhood sweetheart tale.
More than half the world is female, and you hold out for someone you liked as a kid.
It's kind of pedophilic.
True love lasts the ages.
True love involves sex, not abstinence.
You skipped teenage sex because your 4-year-old self had a crush?
I was a late developer.
Highest vocal range in the church choir.
Oh, so pedophilia came naturally to you, then.
She was worth the wait.
Sip.
Rinse.
Spit.
Smile.
Kiss.
21 years and 43 days since our last kiss.
Wow.
I think I remember.
It was behind the toilets, right?
Did we just kiss?
- We were 4 years old.
- Right, so probably just kissed.
That'd be weird.
Who do you think's gonna be happier... your mom or mine?
Probably yours.
Yeah, you're probably right.
She knows you're everything I ever wanted.
Blind confessions of love ain't gonna cut it with a girl like Mila.
If you're too sweet, you'll turn most girls off.
You need attitude, edge, and a hell of a lot more confidence.
You paying attention?
- I'm taking notes.
- No, stop.
You've got to let it flow, not produce a paper on it.
When you're a player, you'll know.
The girls will know, and everything will be easy, like shooting fish in a barrel.
Hi.
One for every day we've been together.
Just like Monday.
- How's your paper going?
- Good.
So unfair you get all this work right when we've become a couple.
Yeah.
I know.
I can't really stay out that late either tonight.
Sorry.
- I've got some good news.
- I started studying cardiology.
I'm not gonna get a degree like you, but I thought perhaps I could help you study.
That's really... that's sweet.
I've got another surprise, too.
But I'll tell you...
I'll tell you about it.
I've always been here beside you.
Your beauty weakens my knees.
You never knew.
How could you?
Each glance and every word a tease.
I couldn't believe it when I had you.
I never thought I'd break through.
I could only barely hold back the tears from my...
Deep and frightful fears.
This bond is new.
Though it'll go on after we've turned to dust, our children will one day remind you of this beautiful love and trust.

That's the cigarette burn?

- That's crazy.
Your dad caught you smoking, and you panicked and put it out on my chest.
You got punished.
I still can't cook with a wooden spoon.

Yeah, I'm sobering up anyway.

Oh.
I'm surprised you didn't get lost in the dark.
I think I might be a natural in the bedroom.
Let's wait and see when you've slept with more than one girl.
She might've been faking.
- Do you fake?
- No.
If a guy's inadequate, it helps him to know.
When I give a compliment, I mean it.
Comes from the heart.
Or the clitoris.
It's not clitoral stimulation that does it for me.
- It's inside.
- Me, too.
It's all about the heart.
I'm talking about the g-spot.
- Oh, the g-spot.
- I'll keep that in mind.
And don't worry.
I won't write it down.
Oh, that one you can tattoo to your hand.
- Boo!
- Hey.
Oh, the main symptoms of V.T. Are... no cheating... palpitations, light-headedness, and...?
I think I have V.T.
I'm serious.
I think I have V.T.
I don't want to do the exam.
Will you do it for me?
Please?
I will do anything.
- Anything?
- Well Maybe not anything.
Hey.
So, this is the guy you've been hiding, huh?
Hi.
I am Astor, and, yes, I am the boyfriend.
- Hi, I'm Jenny.
- Hi, Jenny.
- Astor.
- Oh.
Hi.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Whoa.
Sorry.
Boyfriend?
Want to come pump some iron?
Boost your testosterone?
Uh, my doctor says I shouldn't... got enough testosterone as it is.
Hey, um, did Mila tell you about my birthday party on Saturday?
I was just telling him about your birthday party on Saturday.
Sounds like fun.
- Cool.
- Yeah.
Yeah, it's gonna be fun.
Lucky you got out of that one.
I got her an 89.
You did her exam?
I-I could've got it in the 90s if I just knew my aortic stenosis.
Any of this help with your zoology degree?
My average dropped 10% with the extracurricular studies.
I should've played hard to get.
- Kiss!
Kiss!
Kiss!
Kiss!
- Kiss!
Kiss!
Kiss!
Kiss!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Kiss!
Kiss his face!
Oh!
What?
!
I was...
I was gonna do it!
- I know.
It's fine.
- It's not your fault.
- All right.
Astor.
- Your turn, buddy.
Truth or dare?
Truth.
- What is Mila like in bed?
- Boom!
Jake, come on.
You don't have to answer that.
A taste of warm honey.
A touch to lift the hairs on your neck.
A tongue alive with fire and talent.
And a heart that burns with enveloping heat.
Wow.
That's beautiful.
- Yeah.
- Well, we're in love.
Paging Dr. I am in love.
Dr. I am in love.
- He's in the honeymoon period.
- Dr...
I don't...
- Look at you.
Heart on your sleeve.
- You're unstoppable.
If you feel it, say it, sister.
She's pretty amazing.
Hey, what else do you like about her?
Uh...
I love the way she looks on my bed.
- I love the noises she makes.
- Astor.
No, the noise... the noises she makes when she sleeps.
She's the one.
I never wanted anyone else.
Okay, I-I think it's your turn, Astor.
I'm sure everybody else has stories to share, right?
Yeah, who do you choose?
I choose...
Mila.
Truth or dare?
Anything but truth.
So, that's how she got frostbite.
I thought it was a myth.
I thought I was letting her off the hook.
I mean, who knew licking a freezer could be so dangerous.
She couldn't even kiss after that.
Is she a good kisser?
She's got a fiery tongue.
But when I said that,
I was actually talking about her propensity for anger.
Oh.
I feel like I'm in junior high dating a 15-year-old swimming-pool lifeguard.
Surprised he didn't give me a hickey.
I think he's cute.
I can't be with someone who's still learning how to undo a bra and confuses honeymoon period with love.
I mean, I-I need someone who understands women.
You could teach him.
And be his tricycle while he learns how to ride a bicycle?
No, thank you.
Look, he'll settle into the relationship.
He keeps giving me flowers and more flowers.
They're always tulips.
They're not even fragrant.
I love tulips.
- I-I'm serious.
- I am...
I'm done dating boys.
I want a man who has a choice in women and picks me.
Look, I think you found someone unique, okay?
- Yeah, uniquely inexperienced.
- Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Have you ever been in love?
I'm not the kind of girl that falls in love.
You've had your heart broken, too.
He must've been a pretty special guy.
Nice try.
You know you might not be able to win Mila back.
It's worth a shot.
You're gonna take some hits.
Hit me, bitch.
I won't be the one hitting you, and you won't be calling me bitch.
Biatch!
Ow!
- You got to be strong, okay?
- Water off a duck's back.
That's gonna be your motto.
Water off a duck's back.
Please don't make me try that line again.
- The line worked on me.
- I went home with the guy.
Yeah, a handsome guy, I'm sure.
- That's not the point.
- It was his delivery.
How did I become your Guinea pig?
- I bought you in a pet shop.
- Chose you for your soft coat.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Sensitive.
Sensitive.
Now get Guinea-pigging.
What about her?
You can try him if you like.
Oh, come on.
That girl there.
She's perfect.
Water off a duck's back.
Hi.
Sorry, I...
I saw you outside before, and I think you dropped this.
Uh...
That is definitely not mine.
- Oh, Jesus.
- That's embarrassing.
I'm...
- Did you say "Jesus"?
- Uh-huh.
I'm Roman catholic, and I don't believe in taking the lord's name in vain, and I certainly don't believe in sex before marriage.
"Purity."
Well, it's always a good idea to keep safe.
Stop the spread of STDs.
I'm Roman catholic.
Right.
I might go...
Confess my sins.
What are your sins?
Monogamy, mahogany, general misuse of wood.
You should definitely keep that to yourself.
You're not gonna even finish your drink?
How did that line ever work on you?
It was my condom that I dropped deliberately.
I wanted the guy.
- I told you it'd never work.
- Okay, fine.
But your improvising now, and you've been knocked back three times tonight without even realizing.
Didn't we do this lesson already?
Yes, but it's the most important lesson.
You can't be phased by a rejection.
Okay.
Okay.
I got it.
- Wait.
- You can't be phased by anything.
You know the number-one reason a girl knocks back a guy?
- Wrong line?
- Nerves.
I'm trying to hide my nerves.
Her nerves.
A rejection's often not really a rejection.
It's just a girl being shy, awkward.
Got to ride it out.
Sail the storm to calmer waters.
- Exactly.
- Keep the conversation going until it actually becomes a conversation and not just a pickup line.
Okay, so you're saying I should've kept talking to mother Mary?
Yeah, well, she had a chastity ring on.
I think you gave her enough time.
She would've spread her legs eventually but not for a few months.
Charming.
You will be.
Okay.
Give me a real technique.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Hey.
Oh.
Oh, sorry.
Excuse me.
I, uh...
Hi.
Ooh.
Hi.
Hey, ladies.
Drinks for you courtesy of this guy over here.
- Hey there.
- Hey.
How's it going?
- Hi.
- Cheers.
Cheers.
I love Asian girls.
All right.
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Hey, wait!
Come on!
Pardon my French, but offering to buy girls drinks... it's fucked.
Well, I can't teach you how to be a player in one night.
- I-I agree with that.
- Hey.
Yeah.
Sure.
Sure.
Oh.
Come on.
Yeah... okay.
Yeah, it works.
It's good.
Simple.
Let me see if I got every step right.
Grab and pull.
Shall we call it the modified cave man?
Sorry.
Uh, wait.
Dancing.
Oh.
Morning, sunshine.
Mm.
You didn't go home with Franck?
Well, I don't normally kiss and tell, but since we're on topic, yeah, he came home with me.
Anything else I can learn from him?
Don't be too cool for school.
Be passionate.
That's the new cool.
But Franck's indifferent?
No, Franck's passionate.
About you?
Yeah, he is.
But the question is, what are you passionate about?
Bubbles?
You didn't want to take the lift?
Are we allowed to be in here?
Shh!
Ah.
Watch out for the glass.
It's a view.
We're not just here for the view.
I stopped perving on my neighbors when I was 12.
Come on.
Wow.
They better not be bats.
They're birds.
I'm a birder.
It's a stopover on their migration South.
They winter in Mexico.

You're beautiful.
As clichÃ©d as a response like that is, it might actually get you somewhere.
What about birding?
Is that gonna get me in with the ladies?
- Why not?
- I think it's awesome.
You're awesome.
The shotgun approach?
Hit on every girl you come across?
It's a good strategy.
Yeah.
I'll hit on anything with two legs so long as it doesn't have a penis.
What about the one-legged ladies?
Why should I rule them out?
Less chance of treading on their toes if we go dancing.
Pretty unlikely they'll kick me when I'm down.
How do you kick with one leg?
I'll hit on anything with at least one leg so long as it doesn't have a penis.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
It takes time.
Maybe you need a break.
No.
I'm ready to get back on the horse.
A one-legged horse?
What?
Yeah, good luck.
No, that sounds dangerous.
That's not mine.
Could you hand it to the server?
Hello?
- Kirsten?
- Yes.
- Ah.
- Hello.
Thank you so much.
Did you leave it here earlier?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm an idiot.
- I'm sorry.
I was sitting right here with some friends just, you know, not even an hour ago.
I've been here almost three hours.
- Really?
- Uh, I... how rude.
I didn't introduce myself.
Astor.
Right.
Astor, is that Frenchman over there one of your friends?
That one?
How do you know he's French?
I've never met him before.
I've never...
I don't...
who are you talking about?
- What is he smiling about?
- Uh...
Oh, he's an idiot.
Tell me if I'm being crazy here, but is this some sort of elaborate ruse to meet women?
You think it's elaborate?
Good elaborate, bad elaborate?
- Just... just elaborate.
- Okay.
But look, I've been waiting here alone.
My girlfriend left like 20 minutes ago, and I thought I was doing a good deed, but, um, it seems this is just some pathetic pickup strategy.
- Okay.
W-w-wait.
- W-wait.
Wait.
I'm no good at meeting girls, okay?
Women.
I'm no good at meeting women.
Does that mean I'm not worth knowing?
No, I can tell that you're not worth knowing by your dishonest theft of my time.
Hmm?
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?
Is there any correlation between a guy's ability to pick up and his quality as a partner?
Uh...
A guy with no confidence will stay with anyone and endure anything.
If you never learn how to talk to women, you won't have the power of a choice.
- Mm.
- I love a choice cut of meat.
Oh, no.
Oh.
- Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
- No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Mila's friend is right over there.
Go talk to him.
You have to be friends with Mila's friends.
No, this guy is awful.
- Go.
- Okay.
Jake.
Hey, Jake.
Hey.
Who you here with?
My girlfriend's in the bathroom.
Oh.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
New girlfriend.
- Oh, cool.
- Congratulations.
Hey, babe.
Hi, Astor.
Well, you don't waste any time.
- Hey, take it easy, okay?
- No.
No.
No.
No.
She's easy.
I suppose you two just got it on in the toilet?
Did she tell you that's her favorite spot?
You want to step outside?
- Yeah, I want... yeah.
- Yes, I want to step outside.
I got to, uh, dust off my knuckle dusters first, and I'll b...
I'll be waiting for you.
- You're a butthead!
- You're a headbuttee!
What does that even mean?
- Hey.
- Oh.
Ow!
So silly, Astor.
What?
- What happened?
- Is my eye still there?
What?
What are you doing here?
- We're with Astor.
- Ow, my head.
Well, then he can tell you what happened.
- I'm not done.
- Mila, I forgive you.
- Let's just go.
- Come on.
He headbutted me in the nostril.
- Come on.
- Oh, come here.
I have an orbital fracture.
- What?
- Aah!
- What?
- Ow!
Ow!
My hand!
Ah!
Oh!
Oh, this is so embarrassing.
Aah!
Oh, hi.
Uh...
Well, h... hi.
What are...
I'm...
I dropped my keys, so, um, would you mind helping me look for them?
Sorry, 'cause I was like, "who is this person?"
- Oh, I'm trinity.
I'm...
- I moved in just off the back.
- Oh, you... okay.
- I'm Astor.
I live right here.
- So, we're neighbors.
- Neighbor.
Yeah, and it's my duty, apparently.
- Yeah.
- Let me see.
Right here, huh?
- Yeah, well...
- Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
- Is that... is this them?
- Yes!
- Right here.
- Perfect.
You're my hero.
Here you are.
Sorry.
Why are you pointing them at me?
- Here you go.
- It's caught in the...
- okay, I'm just gonna...
- Stuck on the...
- Ooh, that's gonna hurt.
- Well, you just... you do that.
Okay.
I never pick up keys that way.
I don't know why I did that.
I-I just pick them up normally, like...
So, what are you thinking?
- Yeah.
- Well, um, thank you so much.
- Well, it was nice meeting you.
- You, too.
Perhaps, um, I can come over for a drink sometime.
Or you... you can.
You come over for a drink.
I mean, that's not a command, but if you want, you have...
you can do whatever you want.
- Sure, that would be...
- That'd be nice.
Um, well, it was good to meet you, Astor.
What are you wearing on your hands?
- What?
These?
- Gets cold in Philadelphia.
You didn't want to try boxing hand wraps?
Hey, I'm feeling triumphant, Cali.
You can try and bring me down.
It ain't gonna work.
Well, power to you, but can you at least tell me why you insisted that I come to this park at this ridiculous hour?
♪ Girls, girls, girls ♪
They grow on trees around here.
You want to hit on girls while they're exercising in spandex?
Yes, I do.
Feed me a line.
Well, I don't know how happy they're gonna be about you interrupting their workout.
- All right, fine.
- I already thought of one anyway.
- Go on.
- Okay.
I tell them I'm lost...
ask for directions.
Brilliant.
Genius.
Well, go for it, then.
I will.
See ya.
Good luck.
- Excuse me.
- Hey, um, are you lost?
I mean, I'm...
I'm lost.
Franck?
Oh, my God.
I can tell you that 50% of girls... and I'm speaking from a large sample size... do not know how to give directions.
You...
Are a liar.
A charming liar, just like everybody else.
I'll take charming.
Why does everybody lie to me?
I suppose they just want to get in your pants.
Well, they can have my pants.
I don't want to wear my pants anymore.
- Whoa!
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
- No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
You can take your pants off.
Just, let's...
let me take you home first, okay?
Come on.
Everyone just wants to take me home.
- No.
No.
No.
- Well, that's not what I meant.
All right, now... hey, hey, hey.
Keep your pants on.
Put me down!
- No, we're going home.
- No!
I don't want to go home!
It's a time-out.
Ow!
God!
- Ow!
- Oh.
Daddy, what are they doing?
Just...
All right.
You okay?
Franck?
It's Astor.
Hey.
My head hurts.
Huh.
Must... must've been all the, uh, alcohol.
Was I really, really embarrassing?
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No different than any other child who doesn't want to wear their pants.
Do you want to head out again tonight?
You sure you're up for it?
Ever heard of hair of the dog?
Yeah, but...
Did something happen with Franck?
He went back to Paris.
When?
Mm.
Should be in the air right about now.
- He's a dog.
- He doesn't deserve you.
Let's just stay in tonight.
Hair of the dog applies to relationships, too.
More like hair of the one-legged dog.
I don't get it.
One-legged dog?
- I get the concept.
- What's the joke?
- Uh, I don't know.
- I'm just being silly.
Just trying to cheer you up.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Whoa.
- Oops.
- That was your fault.
I'll be in here.
So, Cali...
Cheers.
I said you could buy me a drink, not stay and chat, so...
- Serious?
- Yeah.
Sorry, I'm waiting for someone.
Strike one.
She liked it when I complimented her dress.
In fact, she made her dress.
She told me that when I tried to tell her my mom had the same one.
Oh.
Needless to say, she knew I was pulling a line.
And your recovery?
- I-I didn't have one.
- Yeah, I kind of froze up.
Well, next time, try and push past the awkwardness.
You know, apparently, people have sex in this pool.
- Mm.
- Yeah.
It's rancid.
Like, if you stick your head underwater, you'll get pregnant.
Well, who's next?
That one.
Hi.
Can I just say your heels are fantastic.
- Louis Vuittons.
- Oh.
Oh.
Of course.
No, no, I am familiar with their work.
I bet you have a huge collection.
I bet you have a huge collection.
Oh, I don't wear high heels.
I'm not talking about heels.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, yeah, well, in that case, I have, like...50 pairs.
But I bet you've got more.
What are you getting at?
- High... high heels.
- I bet you've got more.
I don't know.
I...
I guess...
Well, you're short, so you...
The lift, and... you're an asshole.
Ow!
Ah.
Ah.
I'm not.
I'm no...
I'm not, actually.
I...
She's so much stronger than she looks.
Well, you'll get there.
Apparently, you're supposed to mix a compliment and an insult, and then they get confused, and then they're determined to get your approval.
Apparently?
Well, I've only been explained the technique.
I haven't actually put it into practice.
You're scaring me.
Okay, well, look, just stay away from anything personal.
Third time's a charm.
- Okay.
Okay.

Aren't you a diamond in the rough?
Are you calling my friends rough?

No.

Lovely pair of...
Of friends.
Is this guy bothering you, love?
He basically just said your sisters were rough.
- Did he now?
- Is that true?
- No.
I was talking about...
- Uh, no.
Um...
He's been harassing girls all night.
You again?
You know, my foot really hurts.
And no.
I'm just being friendly.
Bit of a player, are we?
- No.
Definitely not.
- Absolutely not.
In fact, you can ask any...

No.

- Let me take him home.
- Wait.
- You want to take him home?
Yeah.
Are you gonna shag him on your sofa?
That's not necessary.
Oh, yeah?
What about this?
Hey!
Oh, my God!
Well, straight to.
What are you doing?
I got in with you.

I'm sure a lot of amazing guys have been able to meet you with these techniques, but they're not for me.
I feel like a phony.
- No.
- You're definitely an original.
- Then why am I learning lines?
- No more lines.
No more pretending to be someone else.
Okay.
Um, well, you're good at improvising.
We'll work on that.
- No.
No, I get flustered.
- I always say the wrong thing.
I-I-I can't think on my feet.
Hell, I can't even stand on my feet after that girl stomped on me.
No, I'm...
I'm not giving up.
I'm gonna go forward with honesty.
And maybe if a girl gets to know me, she'll still dump me like Mila, but...
I'm too tired to be someone else.
I'm sure there's someone out there for you.
We've been having fun together.
Yeah.
You're heartbroken over Mila.
It's tattooed all over your face.
I like you.
But you love Mila.
No, I think, um, I think you should go with being yourself.
It'll work.
I hope so.
Should get out of those damp clothes.
Slip into something more comfortable?
I'll see you soon.
Can I sit here?
You look like the kind of girl I'd like to know, and if you let me sit here for a minute,
I might be able to find out.
Okay.
I'm...
I'll...
Uh, hello.
- Did you...
- Did you say something?
Hello.
Well, hi.
Pleased to meet you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Me...
S-so, you've lost your voice?
No.
I, um, this is my voice.
Oh.
It's kind of cute.
Thanks.
A hawk.
Red-tailed hawk.
Genus Buteo.
Species Jamaicensis.
That's right.
She sounds perfect.
I dumped her last night.
What?
Why?
She bored me to tears.
You actually cried, didn't you?
I've never had to break up with anyone.
It's kind of difficult.
I sent a 194-character message.
That's two SMS messages.
But I think if you do that, people think you're making an effort.
Well, I never thought I'd say it, Astor, but you're heartless.
That'd be nice.
A heart does not beat on blood alone.
I wish I could rip my heart out and be done with it.
Surely, there are other blood-filled organs that can pump blood around the body.
I don't know how you can say that when you just crushed a heart last night.
I cried for her, and I cried for me.
Yeah, but you loved it.
You think I'm indulging?
You ever get bored when you're sad?
- No.
- So admit it.
- You find sadness entertaining.
- I'm human.
All I'm saying is that emotions are addictive, good or bad.
- Oh, great.
- I'm an addict.
You recommend cold Turkey or weaning?
Um, maybe desensitizing.
Ow!
Come on, man!
Ah!
How'd you mean it, then?
Hmm?
I hope he makes you happy.
I meant it as I said it.
I wasn't being sarcastic.
Sounds sarcastic to me.
I would never use such a low form of wit.
- You're using it now.
- He's using it now, isn't he?
- Hey!
Hey!
- I respect you too much for that.
You sarcastic bastard!
Stop playing games, Astor.
Okay.
Okay.
From the bottom of my heart,
I'm sorry I headbutted you with my eye socket.
God, I could not hate you more.
- Now who's being sarcastic?
- You butthead!
- You love me, don't you?
- Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
- Okay.
All right.
Hey!
- Settle down.
And you.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry I called you easy.
You're definitely not easy.
I was hurt, and it made me nasty.
- He uses sarcasm.
- Just... you drive.
Hey.
I'll try not to get my finger stuck in your ring this time.
What?
- Your key ring.
- Your little...
I'm sorry.
That... that did not come out right...
At all.
I'm sorry.
How's your apartment coming along?
Do you spy on all of your neighbors, or...
Only the cute ones.
Let's hope I'm not included in that.
Not anymore.
Hi.
You didn't have to bring these back.
- They're not my size.
- Yeah.
Um, you should go.
Jake's inside.
You should really talk to Cali again.
- Why?
She's still angry at me.
- She's not gonna forgive me.
What's the point of talking to her?
I can be there.
You know, you should just go, Astor.
Okay.
Oh, hi.
Yeah.
What's this?
It's just... okay.
You had this?
Well, she left it at my place by the bed... under it, really.
It was weeks ago, Jake.
The idea that Mila dropped her drawers in front of you makes me want to upchuck in my mouth.
- Go right ahead.
- Just get out of the way.
- Jake.
Jake!
Jake!
Jake!
- Hey, stop!
Jake!
He's strangling me!
Stop!
Astor.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
Jake?
Jake?
- What did you do to him?
- What did you do?
Jake?
It's a myocardial infarction.
- A heart attack?
- He's only 28 years old.
No, he's got to go to the hospital.
- I'm okay!
- He's okay.
- Oh!
- Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
- Baby.
Baby.
- Do you have insurance?
- I'm okay.
I'm okay.
- Are you sure?
Chest pains, dysemia, high-stress individual, probable steroid usage.
- A textbook scenario.
- Get him out of here!
He needs to see a doctor.
- We're doctors.
- We can handle this.
You're med students, and your grades aren't that good.
Just leave, Astor.
- Okay.
We're gonna be okay.
- Okay?
Just... yeah.
- You ready?
- Left here?
- Yes.
- Left here?
- Yes, right here...
left.
I can't believe there's a hospital around here.
It's a very residential neighborhood.
Oh, my God, I'm stuck behind a grandmother.
Move!
Get out of the way!
- He's barely even breathing.
- Could you just hurry up?
Do you even know where you're going, Astor?
- No.
Not... not really.
- What?
!
- I mean, I have an idea.
- I have a general idea.
- Give me your phone.
- Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
- Just take the phone.
- He's really not good.
- Take the phone.
Look it up.
- What?
Look up where the hospital is.
You probably should've sat up front.
Three Miles ahead.
It should be on your right-hand side.
Are you sure that's the closest?
- That's all we ha...
- Where do you want to go?
Just a free clinic?
God, this guy is just riding me.
Put your brakes on if he's riding you.
Make him crash into you.
I hate people who do that.
Well, we have somewhere to be.
Oh.
Already?
Yeah.
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah.
You okay?
Yeah.
Blood flow's back to normal.
I...
Might be ready to go again in a couple minutes.
Have you said thank you to Astor yet?
I will.
I'm just not looking forward to it.
Well, he probably saved your life, so...
I know.
I know.
He's just gonna be so smug.
Why are you so happy with yourself?
Do I need a reason?
Mm.
You could've let Mila's boyfriend die.
Then at least she'd be available.
It was a toss up.
Impress her by being the hero or let the opposition annihilate himself.
Yeah.
You probably made the right choice.
Did you set this up?
I want you to be friends again.
Astor.
Just give it a shot, okay?
Can we just try, Cali?
I guess.
Thank you.
Let's all just promise that we're gonna be mature about this, okay?
So...
You walked in on Mila with William James, is that right?
Not exactly.
So, you didn't see them together, but you knew that they'd been together.
No.
I was there.
Oh, you were hiding?
No.
William James and I invited Mila to join us.
Where?
I mean, I don't...
In your bed?
Like a...
like a...
A...
MÃ©nage Ã trois?
- Like a three...
- I'm really sorry.
I wish it'd never happened.
I guess it wasn't really cheating, but it was enough to end it.
Three years with one guy.
I actually thought I loved him.
How...
Okay, I think...
I think it's important that we understand how this happened.
How did W.J. Instigate this?
Well, he knew Mila and I were close.
He asked me if I'd ever been with a woman, if I'd ever thought about it, if Mila and I had ever kissed, and it grew from there.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I just wanted to make him happy.
- Oh, you probably did...
- I'm guessing.
I don't...
I'm gue... you know.
I-I thought it was something you both wanted.
I obviously made a huge mistake, and I'm sorry.
Me, too.
But how did it work?
Uh...
I mean, I-I-I-I've had a...
MÃ©nage Ã un.
- A lot... a lot of the time.
- A lot of times.
But a mÃ©nage Ã trois?
Just more people.
Hey, I thought maybe it was time for that drink.
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Come on in.
Yeah.
Thanks.
This is a really nice place.
Oh, thank you.
Yes, uh, make yourself at home.
Sure.
So, uh, do you have any lemons for the...
Uh, no.
No, I'm sorry.
Straight.
It's how I do it.
Cheers.
Ah.
Just...
Hello?
You don't need my advice.
- Uh, yes.
- I'd like to order a half-dozen.
Astor, if she's there with you, it means she likes you.
Okay, how do I go about getting more of the rump steaks?
- Put some music on.
- Get her dancing.
All right.
I'll try those.
Bye.
That was my, uh...
Mail-order meat woman.
I like regular meat.
Always there.
Protein's good.
Yeah.
- Let's put on some music.
- Yes.
You want to put on some music?
Mm-hmm.
Normally, I dance by myself.
Come on, Astor.
Get up.
- You mind?
- I think my head's bleeding.
Let me see.
I think it's bleeding.
Yeah.
Okay.
Here.
All right.
All right.
Oh, I don't see anything.
So, I guess...
Oh.
- All right, it's okay.
- Oh, yeah.
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
No.
No.
No.
No.
It's making it...
making it worse.
Here, let me just...
VoilÃ.
What?
"You could get any girl you want."
She said that?
This your meat lady?
I can't believe she said that.
I have to go.
I'm sorry.
Can you let yourself out?
Hello?
How do I let her know that I'm really into her?
She'll be able to tell.
- I don't think she does.
- I'm gonna tell her.
Are you sure you're not gonna scare her off?
I mean, does she know who you really are... your birding, your loud mouth, your silliness?
I mean, I love all that, but it does take some getting used to.
She accepts me for who I am.
Well, if you feel it, you can tell her.

It was... it was really wonderful what you did for him.
Oh, well, I had to put all that studying to some sort of use.

Yeah.

- Mila, please.
- What?
- Let's talk.
- Your twins are waiting.
They don't matter to me.
And that's why you're a slut.
- Those girls and I just kissed.
- That's it.
Do you know how many girls I've ever slept with?
With or without significantly different DNA?
One is the answer.
Just you.
You were my first, and you didn't even care.
- That's not fair.
- You suffocated me.
I felt like a kitten in a plastic bag.
We had no chance.
But if you come home with me now, we can start again.
Did you break up with Jake, or did he break up with you?
Why does that matter?
You only want me now because other girls want me.
Then go sleep with those other girls.
I might.
I'm single.
That's a pretty big opportunity for me.
I'm offering you a second chance.
The timing is not ideal.
You sleep with those clones, and we might not even be friends.
Come on in.
Water's fine.
I bet it is.
Don't be shy.
Cali.
Oh.
It's too late, Franck.
What about your girlfriend in Paris?
Fini.
I don't believe you.
You never called, and when you left, you said you weren't coming back.
I was taken by surprise.
I had to see you again.
Right.
Well, you're a phony, just like the rest of them.
You're half a man.
Like your friend, uh, Astor.
He's more of a man than you'll ever be.
In fact, he's about the only real guy I know.
- What about George Clooney?
- He's a real guy.
Later, Franck.
Cali, I'm birding.
You want to join?
Hi.
It's so great to be birding again.
I think I'm a convert.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Isn't this a funny thing to do?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Have a look in that tree.
A great horned owl.
Isn't he majestic?
- Yeah.
I love it.
Yeah.
Here.
It's beautiful.
You're beautiful.
They all kind of look the same to me.
Not for me.
Birding's my passion, like medicine is for you.
I can't wait to be a doctor, to be taken seriously for a change.
It won't be Mila or miss Klein.
It'll be, "yes, Dr. Klein.
Would you like a free upgrade, Dr. Klein?"
Yes, I would, thank you.
"Is there a doctor in the house?"
That'll be scary.
I don't know what I'd do if that happened.
Wouldn't it be your duty?
I'm not gonna give mouth-to-mouth to some dirty homeless guy.
I guess that's beyond the call.
You're not gonna spend the whole night flirting, are you?
- Of course not.
- Just that Cali's told me that you've kissed a lot of girls recently.
Cali told you that?
Is it true?
Excuse...
Busy bee.
Uh...
I kissed a couple.
I mean, two separate people.
Not a guy and a girl, like...
Did she tell you that before we got back together?
- I don't know.
- Does it matter?
Oh, by the way.
You should probably have a little more practice before you dance in public.
Boop.
Shall I enroll in some samba classes?
Hey.
Jenny!
Astor!
Hey.
Sorry.
You look awesome.
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?
Come here.
Come on.
Come on.
Mila!
♪ Dry the tears you've shed ♪
♪ shed in the name of love ♪
Whoo.
Oh, my God.
Look at this place.
- Astor, stop.
- Just... stop.
Stop.
We should break up.
What?
I don't make you happy.
Not everyone is happy-go-lucky all the time, Astor.
- You should be.
- Why?
The world is not made up of singing birds and dancing.
I wish my mom would write "happy birthday" on my cake in jam.
I've never seen you eat cake.
I don't eat cake.
I'm a pretty face.
That's my value.
You're not just a pretty face.
You got a good body, too.
Right.
So, you've loved me since we were kids because I was the prettiest girl you knew?
I thought you had some heart, that maybe you love me for other reasons, that you would lift me above that.
You've always been my girl, but...
But what?
I...
We're no... we're...
You're actually breaking up with me.
That's okay.
I'm gonna find happiness on my own.
Besides, it's obvious that you like Cali.
Oh, come on.
I mean, I saw the way her eyes lit up when we were birding.
You guys have been running around chasing girls, trying to get you laid.
You think women want to be played, that we want to be seduced by technique?
You think you understand women because you've had a threesome?
I didn't sleep with them.
It's awkward when you can't tell the difference between two girls.
Do you honestly think Cali's gonna want you when you're so desperately trying to be a male slut?
- Don't use that word.
- It discourages free behavior.
Male?
I thought that was the one word that meant you could do whatever you want and no consequences.
Actually, I meant "slut."
It's a dirty word for "liberated."
I'm gonna tell you one more thing.
Girls want a guy that's nice, sure.
They also want a man.
Your sweetness is charming, Astor.
But it's not always gonna be enough.
Sorry for being sweet.
No, what?
No.
Just... could you go?

So, you, uh, broke up with Mila.
Thought you loved her.
I love her like a sister.
Well, it's a good thing you stopped sleeping with her, then.
Been on any other dates?
I'm taking a break from all that.
Well, it's a numbers game, Astor.
You look phased again.
No.
I'm just cruising along.
Take it or leave it.
Take me or leave me.
Like an old couch on the sidewalk.
Some of those couches are pretty comfy.
- And who are you chasing?
- Franck?
No.
I opened my eyes.
You sure about that?
Are you trying to hit on me again?
I'm not playing games.
I told you I liked you, and I meant it.
- Yeah, I get it.
- No, you don't.
We had fun together, Cali.
Running around chasing girls?
We have fun no matter what we do.
- Are we having fun now?
- Yes.
We would be if you would just let me in.
You make me so happy, Cali.
And... and... and if you let go for one second, you'd see that I make you happy, too.
Isn't that why you tease me all the time?
I don't see how anyone could resist making fun of you.
I'm yours if you want me, Cali.
We might just fall in love.
Yeah.
And you might just break my heart.
Could you love me that much that that would be possible?
Maybe.
That would be wonderful.
Oh, my God.
Hey.
Hey!
Come back here!
Whoo!
Whoa!
Whoo!
Oh, my God.
d Tell a story of a life together d d every house an allegory d
d like the smell of smoke, it lingers on d
Astor?
- Hi.
- Hey.
You wanted to, um, talk about Mila.
We broke up yesterday.
You were dating her?
Um...
I want you to help me get her back.
Oh, Mila and I aren't friends anymore.
That's okay.
She hasn't changed at all.
Oh, well, you're probably better off, then.
She was never interested in people for the right reasons, anyway.
Yeah.
Look, Mila wants a ladies man, confident guy who gets all the girls.
It's not you, is it?
I could learn.
You could teach me.
I just need techniques that work.
4:00?
3 past.
Would you like to grab a coffee?
You had to ask the time before you knew you wanted to ask me out?
Asking the time was my in.
I couldn't hit on you straight up.
Well, you should've asked straight up.
It shows confidence.
Okay.
Okay.
Let's go again.
Hey, what's up, girl?
Want to roll with me, get some coffee?
Yeah, I want to roll with you, right off my feet off the sidewalk and into the gutter.
- Let's do it.
- Ain't happening.
You're putting on a persona.
Are you an actor?
- No.
- Then why are you acting up now?
Hold the bus.
12:00.
May not be possible.
10:00, 11:00, stop thinking with your cock.
What are you hesitating for?
Go.
I can't run after her.
That's desperate.
You said never look desperate.
You know the deal.
Go now.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Um, sorry, can I ask you a question?
Sure, spit it out.
- Oh, that's charming.
- Prince charming.
- Well, what's the question?
- Can I buy you a coffee?
How long is this question you have to ask me over a cup of coffee?
That's the question.
I don't even know you.
I thought you were, I don't know, doing some environmental survey or something.
No, I'm just a boy asking a girl for a coffee.
See that machine in there...
coffee is only $1.
Yeah.
Go get high.
Congratulations.
Your first win.
If I was begging.
Asking a random cutie straight up at this stage was guaranteed to get you knocked back.
- That was the plan.
- An evil plan.
To get you used to being knocked back.
Didn't hurt much, did it?
Hurt like a paper cut on my eyelid.
No pain, no game.
So you're saying I got game?
You're playing the game.
You haven't got game.
- But I be a player, yo.
- All in good time.
Right now, you pay to play.
You got the money?
I have to pay you?
No, I was just being silly, but seriously, can I borrow $20?
Here you are, sir.
- Hey, you idiot.
- What?
- Oh!
Oh!
I-I-I-I...
- What is this?
What am I supposed to do with this?
III-I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
I didn't... you should... but buy your... buy another soda.
Buy yourself a soda.
Okay.
Sorry, is my son bothering you?
Come on, astor.
- Idiot.
- Very sorry.
So, how did you and Mila get together?
Well, let me tell you about it.
Must've been the mixing drinks.
Sambuca and bloody Marys don't really go well to-together.
- Just one more cabernet.
- Well...
- Wee.
- Oh.
d When they fight, they fight d
Oh!
d And when they come home d
Oh.
Happy Birthday, astor.
Your birthday cake.
- Thanks, mom.
- Cherry, like you like it.
Maybe tomorrow.
I'm sorry.
All right.
Okay.
d Was it too much too soon?
d d Was it little too late?
d d He got the message she left on his car in the rain d d And then the words that come to you d
Oh.
- Astor.
- Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
d You just can't let it go d
You're a little drunk.
Oh.
Okay.
I'm just a little tipsy.
Okay.
Okay.
There's no clocks.
Oh.
Okay.
Sorry.
- Okay.
- That's my boob.
Yeah.
You all right?
You love me.
You're the best.
No one loves me like you love me.
I love you, too, Mila.
Cold.
It's cold in your house.
I just puked in my mouth.
I told you to go easy.
It's not the liquor.
It's your sob childhood sweetheart tale.
More than half the world is female, and you hold out for someone you liked as a kid.
It's kind of pedophilic.
True love lasts the ages.
True love involves sex, not abstinence.
You skipped teenage sex because your 4-year-old self had a crush?
I was a late developer.
Highest vocal range in the church choir.
Oh, so pedophilia came naturally to you, then.
She was worth the wait.
Sip.
Rinse.
Spit.
Smile.
Kiss.
21 years and 43 days since our last kiss.
Wow.
I think I remember.
It was behind the toilets, right?
Did we just kiss?
- We were 4 years old.
- Right, so probably just kissed.
That'd be weird.
Who do you think's gonna be happier... your mom or mine?
Probably yours.
Yeah, you're probably right.
She knows you're everything I ever wanted.
Blind confessions of love ain't gonna cut it with a girl like Mila.
If you're too sweet, you'll turn most girls off.
You need attitude, edge, and a hell of a lot more confidence.
You paying attention?
- I'm taking notes.
- No, stop.
You've got to let it flow, not produce a paper on it.
When you're a player, you'll know.
The girls will know, and everything will be easy, like shooting fish in a barrel.
Hi.
Hi.
One for every day we've been together.
Just like Monday.
- How's your paper going?
- Good.
So unfair you get all this work right when we've become a couple.
Yeah.
I know.
I can't really stay out that late either tonight.
Sorry.
I've got some good news.
I started studying cardiology.
I'm not gonna get a degree like you, but I thought perhaps I could help you study.
That's really... that's sweet.
I've got another surprise, too.
But I'll tell you...
I'll tell you about it.
I've always been here beside you.
Your beauty weakens my knees.
You never knew.
How could you?
Each glance and every word a tease.
I couldn't believe it when I had you.
I never thought I'd break through.
I could only barely hold back the tears from my...
Deep and frightful fears.
This bond is new.
Though it'll go on after we've turned to dust, our children will one day remind you of this beautiful love and trust.
d Yeah!
d d Yeah!
d d Yeah!
d d Yeah!
d d Yeah!
d
Ooh.
You first.
d Yeah!
d d Yeah!
d d Yeah!
d
Oh.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, you're so scared.
No, I'm fine.
I just... okay.
d You can have it if you want it d
Ooh, hey, that's my nipple.
Oh.
Did I do that?
Yeah.
When we were 12.
That's the cigarette burn?
- Yeah.
- That's crazy.
Your dad caught you smoking, and you panicked and put it out on my chest.
You got punished.
I still can't cook with a wooden spoon.
Should I turn off the lights?
Yeah, I'm sobering up anyway.
Oh.
d It's everything you dreamed of d d What you want d
- Yeah.
- All right.
Okay.
d Just don't blow it d d Everything's going down d
Oh.
I'm surprised you didn't get lost in the dark.
I think I might be a natural in the bedroom.
Let's wait and see when you've slept with more than one girl.
She might've been faking.
- Do you fake?
- No.
If a guy's inadequate, it helps him to know.
When I give a compliment, I mean it.
Comes from the heart.
Or the clitoris.
It's not clitoral stimulation that does it for me.
- It's inside.
- Me, too.
It's all about the heart.
I'm talking about the g-spot.
Oh, the g-spot.
I'll keep that in mind.
And don't worry.
I won't write it down.
Oh, that one you can tattoo to your hand.
- Boo!
- Hey.
Oh, the main symptoms of V.T. are... no cheating... palpitations, light-headedness, and...?
I think I have V.T.
I'm serious.
I think I have V.T.
I don't want to do the exam.
Will you do it for me?
Please?
I will do anything.
- Anything?
- Well Maybe not anything.
Hey.
So, this is the guy you've been hiding?
Hi.
I am astor, and, yes, I am the boyfriend.
- Hi, I'm Jenny.
- Hi, Jenny.
- Astor.
- Oh.
Hi.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Whoa.
Sorry.
Boyfriend?
Want to come pump some iron?
Boost your testosterone?
My doctor says I shouldn't... got enough testosterone as it is.
Hey, um, did Mila tell you about my birthday party on Saturday?
I was just telling him about your birthday party on Saturday.
Sounds like fun.
- Cool.
- Yeah.
Yeah, it's gonna be fun.
Lucky you got out of that one.
I got her an 89.
You did her exam?
II could've got it in the 90s if I just knew my aortic stenosis.
Any of this help with your zoology degree?
My average dropped 10% with the extracurricular studies.
I should've played hard to get.
Kiss!
Kiss!
Kiss!
Kiss!
Kiss!
Kiss!
Kiss!
Kiss!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Kiss!
Kiss his face!
Oh!
What?
!
I was...
I was gonna do it!
I know.
It's fine.
It's not your fault.
All right.
Astor.
Your turn, buddy.
Truth or dare?
Truth.
What is Mila like in bed?
Boom!
Jake, come on.
You don't have to answer that.
A taste of warm honey.
A touch to lift the hairs on your neck.
A tongue alive with fire and talent.
And a heart that burns with enveloping heat.
Wow.
That's beautiful.
- Yeah.
- Well, we're in love.
Paging Dr. I am in love.
Dr. I am in love.
- He's in the honeymoon period.
- Dr...
I don't...
Look at you.
Heart on your sleeve.
You're unstoppable.
If you feel it, say it, sister.
She's pretty amazing.
Hey, what else do you like about her?
I love the way she looks on my bed.
- I love the noises she makes.
- Astor.
No, the noise... the noises she makes when she sleeps.
She's the one.
I never wanted anyone else.
Okay, I-I think it's your turn, astor.
I'm sure everybody else has stories to share, right?
Yeah, who do you choose?
I choose...
Mila.
Truth or dare?
Anything but truth.
So, that's how she got frostbite.
I thought it was a myth.
I thought I was letting her off the hook.
I mean, who knew licking a freezer could be so dangerous.
She couldn't even kiss after that.
Is she a good kisser?
She's got a fiery tongue.
But when I said that,
I was actually talking about her propensity for anger.
Oh.
I feel like I'm in junior high dating a 15-year-old swimming-pool lifeguard.
Surprised he didn't give me a hickey.
I think he's cute.
I can't be with someone who's still learning how to undo a bra and confuses honeymoon period with love.
I mean, I-I need someone who understands women.
You could teach him.
And be his tricycle while he learns how to ride a bicycle?
No, thank you.
Look, he'll settle into the relationship.
He keeps giving me flowers and more flowers.
They're always tulips.
They're not even fragrant.
I love tulips.
I'm serious.
I am...
I'm done dating boys.
I want a man who has a choice in women and picks me.
Look, I think you found someone unique, okay?
Yeah, uniquely inexperienced.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Have you ever been in love?
I'm not the kind of girl that falls in love.
You've had your heart broken, too.
He must've been a pretty special guy.
Nice try.
You know you might not be able to win Mila back.
It's worth a shot.
You're gonna take some hits.
Hit me, bitch.
I won't be the one hitting you, and you won't be calling me bitch.
Biatch!
You got to be strong, okay?
Water off a duck's back.
That's gonna be your motto.
Water off a duck's back.
Please don't make me try that line again.
The line worked on me.
I went home with the guy.
Yeah, a handsome guy, I'm sure.
That's not the point.
It was his delivery.
How did I become your Guinea pig?
I bought you in a pet shop.
Chose you for your soft coat.
Hey, hey, hey.
Sensitive.
Sensitive.
Now get Guinea-pigging.
What about her?
You can try him if you like.
Oh, come on.
That girl there.
She's perfect.
Water off a duck's back.
Hi.
Sorry, I...
I saw you outside before, and I think you dropped this.
That is definitely not mine.
Oh, Jesus.
That's embarrassing.
I'm...
Did you say "Jesus"?
I'm Roman catholic, and I don't believe in taking the lord's name in vain, and I certainly don't believe in sex before marriage.
"Purity."
Well, it's always a good idea to keep safe.
Stop the spread of STDs.
I'm Roman catholic.
Right.
I might go...
Confess my sins.
What are your sins?
Monogamy, mahogany, general misuse of wood.
You should definitely keep that to yourself.
You're not gonna even finish your drink?
How did that line ever work on you?
It was my condom that I dropped deliberately.
I wanted the guy.
- I told you it'd never work.
- Okay, fine.
But your improvising now, and you've been knocked back three times tonight without even realizing.
Didn't we do this lesson already?
Yes, but it's the most important lesson.
You can't be phased by a rejection.
Okay.
Okay.
I got it.
Wait.
You can't be phased by anything.
You know the number-one reason a girl knocks back a guy?
- Wrong line?
- Nerves.
I'm trying to hide my nerves.
Her nerves.
A rejection's often not really a rejection.
It's just a girl being shy, awkward.
Got to ride it out.
Sail the storm to calmer waters.
Exactly.
Keep the conversation going until it actually becomes a conversation and not just a pickup line.
Okay, so you're saying I should've kept talking to mother Mary?
Yeah, well, she had a chastity ring on.
I think you gave her enough time.
She would've spread her legs eventually but not for a few months.
Charming.
You will be.
Okay.
Give me a real technique.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Hey.
Oh.
Oh, sorry.
Excuse me.
I...
Hi.
Hi.
Ooh.
Hi.
Hey, ladies.
Drinks for you courtesy of this guy over here.
- Hey there.
- Hey.
How's it going?
- Hi.
- Cheers.
Cheers.
I love Asian girls.
All right.
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Hey, wait!
Come on!
Pardon my French, but offering to buy girls drinks... it's fucked.
Well, I can't teach you how to be a player in one night.
- I-I agree with that.
- Hey.
Yeah.
Sure.
Sure.
Oh.
Come on.
Yeah... okay.
Yeah, it works.
It's good.
Simple.
Let me see if I got every step right.
Grab and pull.
Shall we call it the modified cave man?
Sorry.
Wait.
Dancing.
Oh.
Morning, sunshine.
You didn't go home with Franck?
Well, I don't normally kiss and tell, but since we're on topic, yeah, he came home with me.
Anything else I can learn from him?
Don't be too cool for school.
Be passionate.
That's the new cool.
But Franck's indifferent?
No, Franck's passionate.
About you?
Yeah, he is.
But the question is, what are you passionate about?
Bubbles?
You didn't want to take the lift?
Are we allowed to be in here?
Shh!
Watch out for the glass.
It's a view.
We're not just here for the view.
I stopped perving on my neighbors when I was 12.
Come on.
Wow.
They better not be bats.
They're birds.
I'm a birder.
It's a stopover on their migration South.
They winter in Mexico.
How luxurious.

Today was so beautiful.
You're beautiful.
As cliched as a response like that is, it might actually get you somewhere.
What about birding?
Is that gonna get me in with the ladies?
Why not?
I think it's awesome.
You're awesome.
The shotgun approach?
Hit on every girl you come across?
It's a good strategy.
Yeah.
I'll hit on anything with two legs so long as it doesn't have a penis.
What about the one-legged ladies?
Why should I rule them out?
Less chance of treading on their toes if we go dancing.
Pretty unlikely they'll kick me when I'm down.
How do you kick with one leg?
I'll hit on anything with at least one leg so long as it doesn't have a penis.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
It takes time.
Maybe you need a break.
No.
I'm ready to get back on the horse.
A one-legged horse?
What?
Yeah, good luck.
No, that sounds dangerous.
That's not mine.
Could you hand it to the server?
Hello?
- Kirsten?
- Yes.
Hello.
Thank you so much.
Did you leave it here earlier?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm an idiot.
I'm sorry.
I was sitting right here with some friends just, you know, not even an hour ago.
I've been here almost three hours.
Really?
I... how rude.
I didn't introduce myself.
Astor.
Right.
Astor, is that frenchman over there one of your friends?
That one?
How do you know he's French?
I've never met him before.
I've never...
I don't...
who are you talking about?
What is he smiling about?
Oh, he's an idiot.
Tell me if I'm being crazy here, but is this some sort of elaborate ruse to meet women?
You think it's elaborate?
Good elaborate, bad elaborate?
- Just... just elaborate.
- Okay.
But look, I've been waiting here alone.
My girlfriend left like 20 minutes ago, and I thought I was doing a good deed, but, um, it seems this is just some pathetic pickup strategy.
Okay.
W-w-wait.
W-wait.
Wait.
I'm no good at meeting girls, okay?
Women.
I'm no good at meeting women.
Does that mean I'm not worth knowing?
No, I can tell that you're not worth knowing by your dishonest theft of my time.
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?
Is there any correlation between a guy's ability to pick up and his quality as a partner?
A guy with no confidence will stay with anyone and endure anything.
If you never learn how to talk to women, you won't have the power of a choice.
I love a choice cut of meat.
Oh, no.
Oh.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Mila's friend is right over there.
Go talk to him.
You have to be friends with Mila's friends.
No, this guy is awful.
- Go.
- Okay.
Jake.
Hey, Jake.
Hey.
Who you here with?
My girlfriend's in the bathroom.
Oh.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
New girlfriend.
Oh, cool.
Congratulations.
Hey, babe.
Hi, astor.
Well, you don't waste any time.
- Hey, take it easy, okay?
- No.
No.
No.
No.
She's easy.
I suppose you two just got it on in the toilet?
Did she tell you that's her favorite spot?
You want to step outside?
Yeah, I want... yeah.
Yes, I want to step outside.
I got to, dust off my knuckle dusters first, and I'll b...
I'll be waiting for you.
- You're a butthead!
- You're a headbuttee!
What does that even mean?
- Hey.
- Oh.
So silly, astor.
What?
- What happened?
- Is my eye still there?
What?
What are you doing here?
- We're with astor.
- My head.
Well, then he can tell you what happened.
I'm not done.
Mila, I forgive you.
Let's just go.
Come on.
He headbutted me in the nostril.
- Come on.
- Oh, come here.
I have an orbital fracture.
- What?
- Aah!
What?
My hand!
Oh!
Oh, this is so embarrassing.
Aah!
Oh, hi.
Well, h... hi.
What are...
I'm I dropped my keys, so, um, would you mind helping me look for them?
Sorry, 'cause I was like, "who is this person?"
Oh, I'm trinity.
I'm...
I moved in just off the back.
Oh, you... okay.
I'm astor.
I live right here.
- So, we're neighbors.
- Neighbor.
Yeah, and it's my duty, apparently.
Yeah.
Let me see.
Right here?
- Yeah, well...
- Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Is that... is this them?
Yes!
- Right here.
- Perfect.
You're my hero.
Here you are.
Sorry.
Why are you pointing them at me?
- Here you go.
- It's caught in the... okay, I'm just gonna...
stuck on the...
- Ooh, that's gonna hurt.
- Well, you just... you do that.
Okay.
I never pick up keys that way.
I don't know why I did that.
I-I just pick them up normally, like...
So, what are you thinking?
Yeah.
Well, um, thank you so much.
- Well, it was nice meeting you.
- You, too.
Perhaps, um, I can come over for a drink sometime.
Or you... you can.
You come over for a drink.
I mean, that's not a command, but if you want, you have...
you can do whatever you want.
Sure, that would be...
That'd be nice.
Um, well, it was good to meet you, astor.
What are you wearing on your hands?
What?
These?
Gets cold in Philadelphia.
You didn't want to try boxing hand wraps?
Hey, I'm feeling triumphant, Cali.
You can try and bring me down.
It ain't gonna work.
Well, power to you, but can you at least tell me why you insisted that I come to this park at this ridiculous hour?
d Girls, girls, girls d
They grow on trees around here.
You want to hit on girls while they're exercising in spandex?
Yes, I do.
Feed me a line.
Well, I don't know how happy they're gonna be about you interrupting their workout.
All right, fine.
I already thought of one anyway.
- Go on.
- Okay.
I tell them I'm lost...
ask for directions.
Brilliant.
Genius.
Well, go for it, then.
I will.
See ya.
Good luck.
Excuse me.
Hey, um, are you lost?
I mean, I'm...
I'm lost.
Franck?
Oh, my God.
I can tell you that 50% of girls... and I'm speaking from a large sample size... do not know how to give directions.
You...
Are a liar.
A charming liar, just like everybody else.
I'll take charming.
Why does everybody lie to me?
I suppose they just want to get in your pants.
Well, they can have my pants.
I don't want to wear my pants anymore.
Whoa!
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
You can take your pants off.
Just, let's...
let me take you home first, okay?
Come on.
Everyone just wants to take me home.
No.
No.
No.
Well, that's not what I meant.
All right, now... hey, hey, hey.
Keep your pants on.
Put me down!
- No, we're going home.
- No!
I don't want to go home!
It's a time-out.
God!
Oh.
Daddy, what are they doing?
Just...
All right.
You okay?
Franck?
It's astor.
Hey.
My head hurts.
Must... must've been all the, alcohol.
Was I really, really embarrassing?
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No different than any other child who doesn't want to wear their pants.
Do you want to head out again tonight?
You sure you're up for it?
Ever heard of hair of the dog?
Yeah, but...
Did something happen with Franck?
He went back to Paris.
When?
Should be in the air right about now.
He's a dog.
He doesn't deserve you.
Let's just stay in tonight.
Hair of the dog applies to relationships, too.
More like hair of the one-legged dog.
I don't get it.
Onelegged dog?
I get the concept.
What's the joke?
I don't know.
I'm just being silly.
Just trying to cheer you up.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Whoa.
- Oops.
- That was your fault.
I'll be in here.
So, Cali...
Cheers.
I said you could buy me a drink, not stay and chat, so...
- Serious?
- Yeah.
Sorry, I'm waiting for someone.
Strike one.
She liked it when I complimented her dress.
In fact, she made her dress.
She told me that when I tried to tell her my mom had the same one.
Oh.
Needless to say, she knew I was pulling a line.
And your recovery?
II didn't have one.
Yeah, I kind of froze up.
Well, next time, try and push past the awkwardness.
You know, apparently, people have sex in this pool.
Yeah.
It's rancid.
Like, if you stick your head underwater, you'll get pregnant.
Well, who's next?
That one.
Hi.
Can I just say your heels are fantastic.
- Louis Vuitton.
- Oh.
Oh.
Of course.
No, no, I am familiar with their work.
I bet you have a huge collection.
I bet you have a huge collection.
Oh, I don't wear high heels.
I'm not talking about heels.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, yeah, well, in that case, I have, like...50 pairs.
But I bet you've got more.
What are you getting at?
High... high heels.
I bet you've got more.
I don't know.
I...
I guess...
Well, you're short, so you...
The lift, and... you're an asshole.
I'm not.
I'm no...
I'm not, actually.
I...
She's so much stronger than she looks.
Well, you'll get there.
Apparently, you're supposed to mix a compliment and an insult, and then they get confused, and then they're determined to get your approval.
Apparently?
Well, I've only been explained the technique.
I haven't actually put it into practice.
You're scaring me.
Okay, well, look, just stay away from anything personal.
Third time's a charm.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Who's the man?
Who's the man?
- Go.
- Who be the player?
Yeah.
You... you are.
d You got to test me d d Now I can start d d Just come and hold me d d Take me d
Aren't you a diamond in the rough?
Are you calling my friends rough?
No.
No.
No, they...
they are a...
Lovely pair of...
Of friends.
Is this guy bothering you, love?
He basically just said your sisters were rough.
Did he now?
Is that true?
No.
I was talking about...
no.
Um...
He's been harassing girls all night.
You again?
You know, my foot really hurts.
And no.
I'm just being friendly.
Bit of a player, are we?
No.
Definitely not.
Absolutely not.
In fact, you can ask any...
you... ask her.
No.
Is my friend astor drunk again?
Let me take him home.
Wait.
You want to take him home?
Yeah.
Are you gonna shag him on your sofa?
That's not necessary.
Oh, yeah?
What about this?
Hey!
Oh, my God!
Well, straight to.
What are you doing?
I got in with you.
- It's freezing.
- I know.
How's that, mate?
You like that?
Jerk!
That wasn't necessary, but it was worth it.
d Why have we to wait so long?
d d People say we're far too young d d Why have we to wait so long?
d d People say we're far too young d d Too young d
I I'm sure a lot of amazing guys have been able to meet you with these techniques, but they're not for me.
I feel like a phony.
No.
You're definitely an original.
Then why am I learning lines?
No more lines.
No more pretending to be someone else.
Okay.
Um, well, you're good at improvising.
We'll work on that.
No.
No, I get flustered.
I always say the wrong thing.
I-I-I can't think on my feet.
Hell, I can't even stand on my feet after that girl stomped on me.
No, I'm...
I'm not giving up.
I'm gonna go forward with honesty.
And maybe if a girl gets to know me, she'll still dump me like Mila, but...
I'm too tired to be someone else.
I'm sure there's someone out there for you.
We've been having fun together.
Yeah.
You're heartbroken over Mila.
It's tattooed all over your face.
I like you.
But you love Mila.
No, I think, um, I think you should go with being yourself.
It'll work.
I hope so.
Should get out of those damp clothes.
Slip into something more comfortable?
I'll see you soon.
Can I sit here?
You look like the kind of girl I'd like to know, and if you let me sit here for a minute,
I might be able to find out.
Okay.
I'm...
I'll...
Hello.
Did you...
did you say something?
Hello.
Well, hi.
Pleased to meet you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Me...
S-so, you've lost your voice?
No.
I, um, this is my voice.
Oh.
It's kind of cute.
Thanks.
A hawk.
Red-tailed hawk.
Genus buteo.
Species jamaicensis.
That's right.
She sounds perfect.
I dumped her last night.
What?
Why?
She bored me to tears.
You actually cried, didn't you?
I've never had to break up with anyone.
It's kind of difficult.
I sent a 194-character message.
That's two SMS messages.
But I think if you do that, people think you're making an effort.
Well, I never thought I'd say it, astor, but you're heartless.
That'd be nice.
A heart does not beat on blood alone.
I wish I could rip my heart out and be done with it.
Surely, there are other blood-filled organs that can pump blood around the body.
I don't know how you can say that when you just crushed a heart last night.
I cried for her, and I cried for me.
Yeah, but you loved it.
You think I'm indulging?
You ever get bored when you're sad?
- No.
- So admit it.
You find sadness entertaining.
I'm human.
All I'm saying is that emotions are addictive, good or bad.
Oh, great.
I'm an addict.
You recommend cold Turkey or weaning?
Um, maybe desensitizing.
Come on, man!
How'd you mean it, then?
I hope he makes you happy.
I meant it as I said it.
I wasn't being sarcastic.
Sounds sarcastic to me.
I would never use such a low form of wit.
You're using it now.
He's using it now, isn't he?
Hey!
Hey!
I respect you too much for that.
You sarcastic bastard!
Stop playing games, astor.
Okay.
Okay.
From the bottom of my heart,
I'm sorry I headbutted you with my eye socket.
God, I could not hate you more.
- Now who's being sarcastic?
- You butthead!
You love me, don't you?
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Okay.
All right.
Hey!
Settle down.
And you.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry I called you easy.
You're definitely not easy.
I was hurt, and it made me nasty.
- He uses sarcasm.
- Just... you drive.
Hey.
I'll try not to get my finger stuck in your ring this time.
What?
Your key ring.
Your little...
I'm sorry.
That... that did not come out right...
At all.
I'm sorry.
How's your apartment coming along?
Do you spy on all of your neighbors, or...
Only the cute ones.
Let's hope I'm not included in that.
Not anymore.
Hi.
Hi.
You didn't have to bring these back.
- They're not my size.
- Yeah.
Um, you should go.
Jake's inside.
You should really talk to Cali again.
Why?
She's still angry at me.
She's not gonna forgive me.
What's the point of talking to her?
I can be there.
You know, you should just go, astor.
Okay.
Oh, hi.
Yeah.
What's this?
It's just... okay.
You had this?
Well, she left it at my place by the bed... under it, really.
It was weeks ago, Jake.
The idea that Mila dropped her drawers in front of you makes me want to upchuck in my mouth.
Go right ahead.
Just get out of the way.
Jake.
Jake!
Jake!
Jake!
Hey, stop!
Jake!
He's strangling me!
Stop!
Astor.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Jake?
Jake?
What did you do to him?
What did you do?
Jake?
It's a myocardial infarction.
A heart attack?
He's only 28 years old.
No, he's got to go to the hospital.
- I'm okay!
- He's okay.
- Oh!
- Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Baby.
Baby.
Do you have insurance?
- I'm okay.
I'm okay.
- Are you sure?
Chest pains, dysemia, high-stress individual, probable steroid usage.
A textbook scenario.
Get him out of here!
He needs to see a doctor.
We're doctors.
We can handle this.
You're med students, and your grades aren't that good.
Just leave, astor.
Okay.
We're gonna be okay.
Okay?
Just... yeah.
You ready?
Left here?
Yes.
- Left here?
- Yes, right here...
left.
I can't believe there's a hospital around here.
It's a very residential neighborhood.
Oh, my God, I'm stuck behind a grandmother.
Move!
Get out of the way!
He's barely even breathing.
Could you just hurry up?
Do you even know where you're going, astor?
- No.
Not... not really.
- What?
!
I mean, I have an idea.
I have a general idea.
- Give me your phone.
- Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Just take the phone.
He's really not good.
- Take the phone.
Look it up.
- What?
Look up where the hospital is.
You probably should've sat up front.
Three Miles ahead.
It should be on your right-hand side.
Are you sure that's the closest?
That's all we ha...
where do you want to go?
Just a free clinic?
God, this guy is just riding me.
Put your brakes on if he's riding you.
Make him crash into you.
I hate people who do that.
Well, we have somewhere to be.
Oh.
Already?
Yeah.
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah.
You okay?
Yeah.
Blood flow's back to normal.
I...
Might be ready to go again in a couple minutes.
Have you said thank you to astor yet?
I will.
I'm just not looking forward to it.
Well, he probably saved your life, so...
I know.
I know.
He's just gonna be so smug.
Why are you so happy with yourself?
Do I need a reason?
You could've let Mila's boyfriend die.
Then at least she'd be available.
It was a toss up.
Impress her by being the hero or let the opposition annihilate himself.
Yeah.
You probably made the right choice.
Did you set this up?
I want you to be friends again.
Astor.
Just give it a shot, okay?
Can we just try, Cali?
I guess.
Thank you.
Let's all just promise that we're gonna be mature about this, okay?
So...
You walked in on Mila with William James, is that right?
Not exactly.
So, you didn't see them together, but you knew that they'd been together.
No.
I was there.
Oh, you were hiding?
No.
William James and I invited Mila to join us.
Where?
I mean, I don't...
In your bed?
Like a...
like a... a... menage a trois?
Like a three...
I'm really sorry.
I wish it'd never happened.
I guess it wasn't really cheating, but it was enough to end it.
Three years with one guy.
I actually thought I loved him.
How...
Okay, I think...
I think it's important that we understand how this happened.
How did W.J. instigate this?
Well, he knew Mila and I were close.
He asked me if I'd ever been with a woman, if I'd ever thought about it, if Mila and I had ever kissed, and it grew from there.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I just wanted to make him happy.
Oh, you probably did...
I'm guessing.
I don't...
I'm gue... you know.
II thought it was something you both wanted.
I obviously made a huge mistake, and I'm sorry.
Me, too.
But how did it work?
I mean, I-I-I-I've had a...
Menage a un.
A lot... a lot of the time.
A lot of times.
But a menage a trois?
Just more people.
Hey, I thought maybe it was time for that drink.
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Come on in.
Yeah.
Thanks.
This is a really nice place.
Oh, thank you.
Yes, make yourself at home.
Sure.
So, do you have any lemons for the...
No.
No, I'm sorry.
Straight.
It's how I do it.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Just...
Hello?
You don't need my advice.
Yes.
I'd like to order a half-dozen.
Astor, if she's there with you, it means she likes you.
Okay, how do I go about getting more of the rump steaks?
Put some music on.
Get her dancing.
All right.
I'll try those.
Bye.
That was my, Mail-order meat woman.
I like regular meat.
Always there.
Protein's good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
- Let's put on some music.
- Yes.
You want to put on some music?
Normally, I dance by myself.
Come on, astor.
Get up.
You mind?
I think my head's bleeding.
Let me see.
I think it's bleeding.
Yeah.
Okay.
Here.
All right.
All right.
Oh, I don't see anything.
So, I guess...
Oh.
All right, it's okay.
Oh, yeah.
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
No.
No.
No.
No.
It's making it...
making it worse.
Here, let me just...
Voila.
What?
"You could get any girl you want."
She said that?
This your meat lady?
I can't believe she said that.
I have to go.
I'm sorry.
Can you let yourself out?
Hello?
How do I let her know that I'm really into her?
She'll be able to tell.
I don't think she does.
I'm gonna tell her.
Are you sure you're not gonna scare her off?
I mean, does she know who you really are... your birding, your loud mouth, your silliness?
I mean, I love all that, but it does take some getting used to.
She accepts me for who I am.
Well, if you feel it, you can tell her.
d Set my silly little heart on fire d d Became my desire d d You stood me up d
What are you...
Do you think I'm the only girl that likes you?
What do you mean?
I just rejected a girl.
Oh, so you're feeling confident, or you want to make Mila jealous.
Am I not successful enough with women for you, too?
Is that it?
No, you're a romantic.
You want to find the one, and...
Watch movies together when it's raining, make breakfast for each other on Sunday mornings.
It's just, that's not me.
It's not what I want.
d You stood me up d d You stood me up d
Hi.
I'm sorry about before.
Oh!
Oh, um, I'm sorry.
Did I do something wrong?
I did.
No, but your hairy tongue did, so...
Should I go and shave it?
No, just cut it off, maybe.
And send it to you in the mail.
Or just swallow it.
Either way.
Enjoy.
Mila said you really like birds, so I brought you here.
I appreciate it.
Would've paid extra for the Turkey if you wanted.
Poultry's poultry.
Turkey seems a little bit more festive.
Did you have a cerebral aneurysm associated with your arrhythmia?
A period where your brain goes without blood.
How would I know that?
There's a test they do.
Oh, then, definitely don't have that 'cause they didn't do the test.
That's good.
So, um, thank you for taking me to the hospital, and I'm sorry that I was a butthead.
That's okay.
You're not...
You're not gonna say that I wasn't a butthead?
You were a little bit of a butthead.
- No.
No, I was not.
- Okay.
No.
Man, you really don't know when to back down, do you?
- And you do?
- Yeah.
What about now.
is now the time to back down?
For me or for you?
I just...
Neither, man.
Boom!
Out this way.
You have anything other than chicken?
Oh.
- Astor.
- What?
Hey.
- And you are twins.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Trinity, divinity.
Trinity and divinity.
I suppose you have a sister named naivete, too.
Or that's just me.
- We're twins, not triplets.
- Right.
Okay.
So, it was you that I was presumptive with.
Yeah.
Trinity told me that she didn't know anyone here.
Yeah, I was kind of keeping you a secret, too.
I just thought you were creepy.
Sadly, I have that effect on women.
Well, I think you're pretty charming.
- Oh.
Well.
- And I was, um...
I don't know if you wanted to have dinner tonight or something?
Yeah.
Yes.
Great.
Let's all three have dinner.
Yeah.
Sure.
Can I ask you guys a silly question?
- Sure.
- Sure.
Have you two ever kissed?
d She was born a cali girl d d The sun and surf, it was her world d d Till mom and dad had split apart d d A broken home, a broken heart d d And then she walked into my life d
d I swore one day she'd be my wife d d And I'm not sure if I was wrong d d And that is why I wrote this song d d About the girl I met one day d
d Who took my heart and went away d d And left me there to dream again d d Of all the things she ever meant d d Of battleships and butterflies d d And all the tears we ever cried d
d And hours and hours of sunny smiles d
Oh, God.
Okay.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hi.
Yeah...
Jake and I broke up.
How did he take it?
Well, he didn't have a heart attack.
It was... it was really wonderful what you did for him.
Oh, well, I had to put all that studying to some sort of use.
He's really appreciative, and...
Yeah.
Yeah.
He bought me that chicken dinner.
Can I just come in?
Can...
Can we talk tomorrow?
Are you okay?
- I'm...
Naked.
- Yeah.
- But otherwise, I'm good.
- Okay.
Yeah, that's fine.
Let's just...
let's just catch up tomorrow.
Okay.
Hi.
Who are you?
Who am I?
Who are you?
Who's she?
Who are they?
Trinity and divinity.
Right?
Yeah.
Okay, guys.
Here, let's...
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
You all right?
Bye.
Mila, please.
What?
- Let's talk.
- Your twins are waiting.
They don't matter to me.
And that's why you're a slut.
Those girls and I just kissed.
That's it.
Do you know how many girls I've ever slept with?
With or without significantly different DNA?
One is the answer.
Just you.
You were my first, and you didn't even care.
That's not fair.
You suffocated me.
I felt like a kitten in a plastic bag.
We had no chance.
But if you come home with me now, we can start again.
Did you break up with Jake, or did he break up with you?
Why does that matter?
You only want me now because other girls want me.
Then go sleep with those other girls.
I might.
I'm single.
That's a pretty big opportunity for me.
I'm offering you a second chance.
The timing is not ideal.
You sleep with those clones, and we might not even be friends.
Come on in.
Water's fine.
I bet it is.
Don't be shy.
Cali.
Oh.
It's too late, Franck.
What about your girlfriend in Paris?
Fini.
I don't believe you.
You never called, and when you left, you said you weren't coming back.
I was taken by surprise.
I had to see you again.
Right.
Well, you're a phony, just like the rest of them.
You're half a man.
Like your friend, astor.
He's more of a man than you'll ever be.
In fact, he's about the only real guy I know.
What about George Clooney?
He's a real guy.
Later, Franck.
Cali, I'm birding.
You want to join?
Hi.
It's so great to be birding again.
I think I'm a convert.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Isn't this a funny thing to do?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Have a look in that tree.
A great horned owl.
Isn't he majestic?
Yeah.
I love it.
Yeah.
Here.
It's beautiful.
You're beautiful.
They all kind of look the same to me.
Not for me.
Birding's my passion, like medicine is for you.
I can't wait to be a doctor, to be taken seriously for a change.
It won't be Mila or miss Klein.
It'll be, "yes, Dr. Klein.
Would you like a free upgrade, Dr. Klein?"
Yes, I would, thank you.
"Is there a doctor in the house?"
That'll be scary.
I don't know what I'd do if that happened.
Wouldn't it be your duty?
I'm not gonna give mouth-to-mouth to some dirty homeless guy.
I guess that's beyond the call.
You're not gonna spend the whole night flirting, are you?
- Of course not.
- Just that Cali's told me that you've kissed a lot of girls recently.
Cali told you that?
Is it true?
Excuse...
Busy bee.
I kissed a couple.
I mean, two separate people.
Not a guy and a girl, like...
Did she tell you that before we got back together?
I don't know.
Does it matter?
Oh, by the way.
You should probably have a little more practice before you dance in public.
Boop.
Shall I enroll in some samba classes?
Hey.
Hey.
Jenny!
Astor!
Hey.
Sorry.
You look awesome.
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?
Come here.
Come on.
Come on.
Mila!
d Dry the tears you've shed d d Shed in the name of love d
Whoo.
Oh, my God.
Look at this place.
Astor, stop.
Just... stop.
Stop.
We should break up.
What?
I don't make you happy.
Not everyone is happy-go-lucky all the time, astor.
- You should be.
- Why?
The world is not made up of singing birds and dancing.
I wish my mom would write "happy birthday" on my cake in jam.
I've never seen you eat cake.
I don't eat cake.
I'm a pretty face.
That's my value.
You're not just a pretty face.
You got a good body, too.
Right.
So, you've loved me since we were kids because I was the prettiest girl you knew?
I thought you had some heart, that maybe you love me for other reasons, that you would lift me above that.
You've always been my girl, but...
But what?
I...
We're no... we're...
You're actually breaking up with me.
That's okay.
I'm gonna find happiness on my own.
Besides, it's obvious that you like Cali.
Oh, come on.
I mean, I saw the way her eyes lit up when we were birding.
You guys have been running around chasing girls, trying to get you laid.
You think women want to be played, that we want to be seduced by technique?
You think you understand women because you've had a threesome?
I didn't sleep with them.
It's awkward when you can't tell the difference between two girls.
Do you honestly think Cali's gonna want you when you're so desperately trying to be a male slut?
Don't use that word.
It discourages free behavior.
Male?
I thought that was the one word that meant you could do whatever you want and no consequences.
Actually, I meant "slut."
It's a dirty word for "liberated."
I'm gonna tell you one more thing.
Girls want a guy that's nice, sure.
They also want a man.
Your sweetness is charming, astor.
But it's not always gonna be enough.
Sorry for being sweet.
No, what?
No.
Just... could you go?
d You say that we're different d d I feel the same d
d Sunshine and rain d
d Make a beautiful thing d
d My strength is your weakness d d My heart is own d
d Your voice breaks my silence d d Then we're alone d
d Sunshine and rain d
Hey.
Hi.
I'm trinity.
This is my sister, divinity.
Boo.
Hi.
It's good to see you.
It's going.
Come and sit down.
d Hey d d It's happened again d d No d d Hey d d I cannot leave d d You know d d Hey d d Forget how to breathe again d d Hey d d I cannot just leave again d
d I love your eyes and your smile d d So won't you please invite me to stay for a while?
d d 'Cause the ride home's long d d And the birds will sing a song d d If we spent this moment together d d Watch the sun rise up together again d
So, you, broke up with Mila.
Thought you loved her.
I love her like a sister.
Well, it's a good thing you stopped sleeping with her, then.
Been on any other dates?
I'm taking a break from all that.
Well, it's a numbers game, astor.
You look phased again.
No.
I'm just cruising along.
Take it or leave it.
Take me or leave me.
Like an old couch on the sidewalk.
Some of those couches are pretty comfy.
And who are you chasing?
Franck?
No.
I opened my eyes.
You sure about that?
Are you trying to hit on me again?
I'm not playing games.
I told you I liked you, and I meant it.
- Yeah, I get it.
- No, you don't.
We had fun together, Cali.
Running around chasing girls?
We have fun no matter what we do.
- Are we having fun now?
- Yes.
We would be if you would just let me in.
You make me so happy, Cali.
And... and... and if you let go for one second, you'd see that I make you happy, too.
Isn't that why you tease me all the time?
I don't see how anyone could resist making fun of you.
I'm yours if you want me, Cali.
We might just fall in love.
Yeah.
And you might just break my heart.
Could you love me that much that that would be possible?
Maybe.
That would be wonderful.
Oh, my God.
Hey.
Hey!
Come back here!
Whoo!
Whoa!
Whoo!
Oh, my God.

-Hi.
-Hey.
You wanted to, um, talk about mila.
-We broke up yesterday.
-You were dating her?
-Um...
I want you to help me get her back.
-Oh, mila and I aren't friends anymore.
-That's okay.
She hasn't changed at all.
-Oh, well, you're probably better off, then.
She was never interested in people for the right reasons, anyway.
-Yeah.
-Look, mila wants a ladies man, confident guy who gets all the girls.
It's not you, is it?
-I could learn.
Uh...
You could teach me.
I just need techniques that work.
-[ Chuckles ]

-3 past.
-Would you like to grab a coffee?
-You had to ask the time before you knew you wanted to ask me out?
-Asking the time was my in.

-Well, you should've asked straight up.
It shows confidence.
-Okay.
Okay.
Let's go again.
Hey, what's up, girl?

-Yeah, I want to roll with you, right off my feet off the sidewalk and into the gutter.

-10:00, 11:00, stop thinking with your cock.
What are you hesitating for?
Go.
-I can't run after her.
That's desperate.
You said never look desperate.
-You know the deal.
Go now.
-Ah...
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Um, sorry, uh, can I ask you a question?
-Sure, spit it out.
-[ Spits ]
-Oh, that's charming.
-[ Chuckles ] Prince charming.
-Well, what's the question?
-Can I buy you a coffee?
-Uh, how long is this question you have to ask me over a cup of coffee?
-That's the question.
-I don't even know you.
I thought you were, I don't know, doing some environmental survey or something.
-No, I'm just a boy asking a girl for a coffee.
-See that machine in there -- coffee is only $1.
Yeah.
Go get high.
-Congratulations.
Your first win.
-If I was begging.
-Asking a random cutie straight up at this stage was guaranteed to get you knocked back.
-That was the plan.
-An evil plan.
-To get you used to being knocked back.
Didn't hurt much, did it?
-Hurt like a paper cut on my eyelid.
-No pain, no game.
-So you're saying I got game?
-[ Chuckles ]
You're playing the game.
You haven't got game.
-But I be a player, yo.
-All in good time.
Right now, you pay to play.
You got the money?
-I have to pay you?
-No, I was just being silly, but seriously, can I borrow $20?
-Here you are, sir.

-Buy yourself a soda.
-Okay.
-Sorry, is my son bothering you?
Come on, astor.
-Idiot.
-Very sorry.
-So, how did you and mila get together?
-Well, let me tell you about it.
-[ Coughing ]
-Must've been the mixing drinks.

-It's not the liquor.

It was behind the toilets, right?
Did we just kiss?
-We were 4 years old.
-Right, so probably just kissed.
That'd be weird.
[ Chuckles ]
-Who do you think's gonna be happier -- your mom or mine?
-Probably yours.
-Yeah, you're probably right.
She knows you're everything I ever wanted.
-Blind confessions of love ain't gonna cut it with a girl like mila.
If you're too sweet, you'll turn most girls off.
You need attitude, edge, and a hell of a lot more confidence.
You paying attention?
-I'm taking notes.
-[ Chuckling ] No, stop.
You've got to let it flow, not produce a paper on it.
When you're a player, you'll know.

-Hi.
One for every day we've been together.
-Just like Monday.
-How's your paper going?
-Good.
-So unfair you get all this work right when we've become a couple.
-Yeah.
I know.
I can't really stay out that late either tonight.
Sorry.
-I've got some good news.
I started studying cardiology.
I'm not gonna get a degree like you, but I thought perhaps I could help you study.
-That's really -- that's sweet.
-I've got another surprise, too.
But I'll tell you -- I'll tell you about it.
I've always been here beside you.
Your beauty weakens my knees.
You never knew.
How could you?
Each glance and every word a tease.
I couldn't believe it when I had you.
I never thought I'd break through.
I could only barely hold back the tears from my...

-Hey, um, did mila tell you about my birthday party on Saturday?
-I was just telling him about your birthday party on Saturday.

Your turn, buddy.
Truth or dare?
-Truth.
-What is mila like in bed?
Boom!
-Jake, come on.
-You don't have to answer that.
-A taste of warm honey.
A touch to lift the hairs on your neck.
A tongue alive with fire and talent.
And a heart that burns with enveloping heat.
-Wow.
That's beautiful.
-Yeah.
-Well, we're in love.
Paging Dr. I am in love.
Dr. I am in love.
-He's in the honeymoon period.
-Dr. -
- I don't...
-Look at you.
Heart on your sleeve.
You're unstoppable.
-If you feel it, say it, sister.
-She's pretty amazing.
Hey, what else do you like about her?
-Uh...
I love the way she looks on my bed.
-[ Chuckles ]
-I love the noises she makes.
-Astor.
-No, the noise -- the noises she makes when she sleeps.
She's the one.
I never wanted anyone else.
-Okay, I-I think it's your turn, astor.
I'm sure everybody else has stories to share, right?
-Yeah, who do you choose?
-I choose...
Mila.
Truth or dare?
-Anything but truth.
-So, that's how she got frostbite.
-I thought it was a myth.
I thought I was letting her off the hook.
I mean, who knew licking a freezer could be so dangerous.
She couldn't even kiss after that.
-Is she a good kisser?
-She's got a fiery tongue.
But when I said that,
I was actually talking about her propensity for anger.
-Oh.
-I feel like I'm in junior high dating a 15-year-old swimming-pool lifeguard.
Surprised he didn't give me a hickey.
-I think he's cute.
-I can't be with someone who's still learning how to undo a bra and confuses honeymoon period with love.
I mean, I-I need someone who understands women.
-You could teach him.
-And be his tricycle while he learns how to ride a bicycle?
No, thank you.
-Look, he'll settle into the relationship.
-He keeps giving me flowers and more flowers.
They're always tulips.
They're not even fragrant.
-I love tulips.
-I-I'm serious.
I am -
- I'm done dating boys.
I want a man who has a choice in women and picks me.
-Look, I think you found someone unique, okay?
-Yeah, uniquely inexperienced.
[ Chuckles ] Goodnight.
-Goodnight.
[ Door closes ]
-Have you ever been in love?
-I'm not the kind of girl that falls in love.
-You've had your heart broken, too.
He must've been a pretty special guy.
-Nice try.
-[ Chuckles ]
-You know you might not be able to win mila back.
-It's worth a shot.
-You're gonna take some hits.
-Hit me, bitch.
-I won't be the one hitting you, and you won't be calling me bitch.
-Biatch!
Ow!
-You got to be strong, okay?
Water off a duck's back.
That's gonna be your motto.
-Water off a duck's back.
[ Mid-tempo music plays ]
Please don't make me try that line again.
-The line worked on me.
I went home with the guy.
-Yeah, a handsome guy, I'm sure.
-That's not the point.
It was his delivery.
-How did I become your Guinea pig?
-I bought you in a pet shop.
Chose you for your soft coat.
-Hey, hey, hey.

-Now get Guinea-pigging.
-What about her?
-You can try him if you like.
-Oh, come on.
-[ Chuckles ]

She's perfect.
-Water off a duck's back.
Hi.
Sorry, I --
I saw you outside before, and I think you dropped this.
-Uh...
[ Chuckles ]
That is definitely not mine.
-Oh, Jesus.
That's embarrassing.
I'm...
-Did you say "Jesus"?
-Uh-huh.
-I'm Roman catholic, and I don't believe in taking the lord's name in vain, and I certainly don't believe in sex before marriage.
-"Purity."
Well, it's always a good idea to keep safe.
Stop the spread of stds.
-I'm Roman catholic.
-Right.
I might go...
Confess my sins.
-What are your sins?
-Monogamy, mahogany, general misuse of wood.
-You should definitely keep that to yourself.
-You're not gonna even finish your drink?
How did that line ever work on you?
-It was my condom that I dropped deliberately.
I wanted the guy.
-I told you it'd never work.
-Okay, fine.
But your improvising now, and you've been knocked back three times tonight without even realizing.
-Didn't we do this lesson already?
-Yes, but it's the most important lesson.
You can't be phased by a rejection.
-Okay.
Okay.
I got it.
-Wait.
You can't be phased by anything.
You know the number-one reason a girl knocks back a guy?
-Wrong line?
-Nerves.
-I'm trying to hide my nerves.
-Her nerves.
A rejection's often not really a rejection.
It's just a girl being shy, awkward.
Got to ride it out.
-Sail the storm to calmer waters.
-Exactly.
Keep the conversation going until it actually becomes a conversation and not just a pickup line.
-Okay, so you're saying I should've kept talking to mother Mary?
-Yeah, well, she had a chastity ring on.
I think you gave her enough time.
She would've spread her legs eventually but not for a few months.
-Charming.
-[ Clears throat ] You will be.
-Okay.
Give me a real technique.
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

-Don't be too cool for school.

My girlfriend left like 20 minutes ago, and I thought I was doing a good deed, but, um, it seems this is just some pathetic pickup strategy.
-Okay.
W-w-wait.
W-wait.
Wait.
I'm no good at meeting girls, okay?
Women.
I'm no good at meeting women.
Does that mean I'm not worth knowing?
-No, I can tell that you're not worth knowing by your dishonest theft of my time.
Hmm?
-Oh, my God.
What are you doing?
-[ Speaks French ]
-[ Sighs ]
Is there any correlation between a guy's ability to pick up and his quality as a partner?
-[ Speaks French ]
-Uh...
-A guy with no confidence will stay with anyone and endure anything.
If you never learn how to talk to women, you won't have the power of a choice.
-Mm.
I love a choice cut of meat.
-[ Speaks French ]
-Oh, no.
Oh. [ Muttering ]
-[ Speaks French ]
-Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Mila's friend is right over there.
-Go talk to him.
You have to be friends with mila's friends.
-No, this guy is awful.
-Go.
-Okay.
-[ Speaks French ]
[ Both chuckle ]
-Jake.
Hey, Jake.
Hey.
Who you here with?
-My girlfriend's in the bathroom.
-Oh.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
-New girlfriend.
-Oh, cool.
Congratulations.
-Hey, babe.
-Hi, astor.
-Well, you don't waste any time.
-Hey, take it easy, okay?
-No.
No.
No.
No.
She's easy.
I suppose you two just got it on in the toilet?
Did she tell you that's her favorite spot?
-[ Scoffs ]
-You want to step outside?
-Yeah, I want -- yeah.
Yes, I want to step outside.
I got to, uh, dust off my knuckle dusters first, and I'll b-- I'll be waiting for you.
-You're a butthead!
-You're a headbuttee!
-What does that even mean?
[ Both grunt ]
-Hey.
-Oh.
Ow!
-So silly, astor.
-What?
-What happened?
-Is my eye still there?
-What?
What are you doing here?
-We're with astor.
-[ Sighs ] Ow, my head.
-Well, then he can tell you what happened.
-I'm not done.
Mila, I forgive you.
-Let's just go.
Come on.
-He headbutted me in the nostril.
-Come on.
-Oh, come here.
-I have an orbital fracture.
-[ Speaks French ]
-What?
-Aah!
-What?
-Ow!
Ow!
-[ Speaks French ]
-My hand!
Ah!
Oh!
-[ Speaks French ]
-Oh, this is so embarrassing.
Aah!
-Oh, hi.
-Uh...
Well, h-- hi.
[ Clears throat ] What are...
-I'm -
- I dropped my keys, so, um, would you mind helping me look for them?
-Sorry, 'cause I was like, "who is this person?"
-Oh, I'm trinity.
I'm -- I moved in just off the back.
-Oh, you -- okay.
I'm astor.
I live right here.
-So, we're neighbors.
-Neighbor.
-Yeah, and it's my duty, apparently.
-[ Chuckles ]
-[ Chuckling ] Yeah.
Let me see.
Right here, huh?
-Yeah, well -- -wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Is that -- is this them?
-Yes!
-Right here.
-Perfect.
You're my hero.
-Here you are.
Sorry.
-[ Chuckling ] Why are you pointing them at me?
-[ Stutters ] Here you go.
-It's caught in the - okay, I'm just gonna -- stuck on the...
-Ooh, that's gonna hurt.
-Well, you just -- you do that.
Okay.
I never pick up keys that way.
I don't know why I did that.
I-I just pick them up normally, like...
So, what are you thinking?
Yeah.
-Well, um, thank you so much.
-Well, it was nice meeting you.
-You, too.
-Perhaps, um, I can come over for a drink sometime.
Or you -- you can.
You come over for a drink.
I mean, that's not a command, but if you want, you have -- you can do whatever you want.
-Sure, that would be...
That'd be nice.
Um, well, it was good to meet you, astor.
-[ Chuckles ]
What are you wearing on your hands?
-What?
These?
Gets cold in Philadelphia.
-You didn't want to try boxing hand wraps?
-Hey, I'm feeling triumphant, cali.
You can try and bring me down.
It ain't gonna work.
-Well, power to you, but can you at least tell me why you insisted that I come to this park at this ridiculous hour?
-♪ Girls, girls, girls ♪
They grow on trees around here.
-You want to hit on girls while they're exercising in spandex?
[ Laughs ]
-Yes, I do.
Feed me a line.
-Well, I don't know how happy they're gonna be about you interrupting their workout.
-All right, fine.
I already thought of one anyway.
-Go on.
-Okay.
I tell them I'm lost -- ask for directions.
Brilliant.
-Genius.
Well, go for it, then.
-I will.
See ya.
-Good luck.
-Excuse me.
Hey, um, are you lost?
I mean, I'm -
- I'm lost.
[ Both moaning ]
-Franck?
-[ Panting ]
-Oh, my God.
[ Groans ]
[ Breathing heavily ]
I can tell you that 50% of girls -- and I'm speaking from a large sample size -- do not know how to give directions.
-You...
Are a liar.
A charming liar, just like everybody else.
-I'll take charming.
-Why does everybody lie to me?
-I suppose they just want to get in your pants.
-Well, they can have my pants.
I don't want to wear my pants anymore.
-Whoa!
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
You can take your pants off.
Just, let's -- let me take you home first, okay?
Come on.
-Everyone just wants to take me home.
-No.
No.
No.
Well, that's not what I meant.
All right, now -- hey, hey, hey.
Keep your pants on.
-Put me down!
-No, we're going home.
-No!
I don't want to go home!
-It's a time-out.
-[ Grunts ]
-Ow!
God!
Ow!
-Oh.
Daddy, what are they doing?
-Just...
All right.
[ Grunts ]
[ Breathing heavily ]
[ Thumps ]
You okay?
-Franck?
-It's astor.
-[ Groans ]
Hey.
My head hurts.
-Huh.
Must -- must've been all the, uh, alcohol.
-[ Sighs ]
Was I really, really embarrassing?
-No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No different than any other child who doesn't want to wear their pants.
-[ Sighs ]
Do you want to head out again tonight?
-You sure you're up for it?
-Ever heard of hair of the dog?
-Yeah, but...
Did something happen with franck?
-He went back to Paris.
-When?
-Mm.
Should be in the air right about now.
-He's a dog.
He doesn't deserve you.
Let's just stay in tonight.
-Hair of the dog applies to relationships, too.
-More like hair of the one-legged dog.
-[ Chuckles ] I don't get it.
-One-legged dog?
-I get the concept.
What's the joke?
-Uh, I don't know.
I'm just being silly.
Just trying to cheer you up.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Whoa.
[ Glass shatters ]
-Oops.
-That was your fault.
-[ Chuckles ]
-I'll be in here.
[ Indistinct conversations ]
-So, cali...
-Cheers.
I said you could buy me a drink, not stay and chat, so...
-Serious?
-Yeah.
Sorry, I'm waiting for someone.
-Strike one.
She liked it when I complimented her dress.
In fact, she made her dress.
She told me that when I tried to tell her my mom had the same one.
-Oh.
-Needless to say, she knew I was pulling a line.
-And your recovery?
-I-I didn't have one.
Yeah, I kind of froze up.
-Well, next time, try and push past the awkwardness.
-[ Sighs ]
You know, apparently, people have sex in this pool.
-Mm.
-Yeah.
It's rancid.
Like, if you stick your head underwater, you'll get pregnant.
-Well, who's next?
-That one.
Hi. [ Chuckles ]
Can I just say your heels are fantastic.
-Louis vuittons.
-Oh.
Oh.
Of course.
No, no, I am familiar with their work.
I bet you have a huge collection.
-I bet you have a huge collection.
-Oh, I don't wear high heels.
-I'm not talking about heels.
-Oh. [ Chuckling ] Oh.
Oh, yeah, well, in that case, I have, like...50 pairs.
But I bet you've got more.
-What are you getting at?
-High -- high heels.
I bet you've got more.
I don't know.
I -
- I guess...
Well, you're short, so you...

-Ow!
Ah.
Ah.
I'm not.
I'm no-
- I'm not, actually.

She's so much stronger than she looks.
-Well, you'll get there.
Apparently, you're supposed to mix a compliment and an insult, and then they get confused, and then they're determined to get your approval.
-Apparently?
-Well, I've only been explained the technique.
I haven't actually put it into practice.
-You're scaring me.
-Okay, well, look, just stay away from anything personal.
Third time's a charm.
-Okay.
Okay.

-Is this guy bothering you, love?
-He basically just said your sisters were rough.
-Did he now?
Is that true?
-No.
I was talking about -- uh, no.
Um...
-He's been harassing girls all night.
-You again?
You know, my foot really hurts.
And no.

-No.
Definitely not.
Absolutely not.

No.
-Is my friend astor drunk again?

-Wait.
You want to take him home?
-Yeah.
-Are you gonna shag him on your sofa?

[ Both chuckle ]
-I -
- I'm sure a lot of amazing guys have been able to meet you with these techniques, but...
[ Sighs ] ...they're not for me.
I feel like a phony.
-[ Chuckling ] No.
You're definitely an original.
-Then why am I learning lines?
No more lines.
No more pretending to be someone else.
-Okay.
Um, well, you're good at improvising.
We'll work on that.
-No.
No, I get flustered.
I always say the wrong thing.
I-I-I can't think on my feet.
Hell, I can't even stand on my feet after that girl stomped on me.
[ Both chuckle ]
No, I'm -
- I'm not giving up.
I'm gonna go forward with honesty.
And maybe if a girl gets to know me, she'll still dump me like mila, but...
I'm too tired to be someone else.
-I'm sure there's someone out there for you.
-We've been having fun together.
-Yeah.
You're heartbroken over mila.
It's tattooed all over your face.
[ Chuckles ]
-I like you.
-But you love mila.
No, I think, um, I think you should go with being yourself.
It'll work.
-I hope so.
-Should get out of those damp clothes.
-Slip into something more comfortable?
-[ Chuckles ]
I'll see you soon.
-Can I sit here?
You look like the kind of girl I'd like to know, and if you let me sit here for a minute,
I might be able to find out.
Okay.
I'm...
I'll...
-Uh, hello.
-Did you -- did you say something?
-Hello.
-Well, hi.
-Pleased to meet you.
-Yeah.
Yeah.
Me...
[ Stutters ]
S-so, you've lost your voice?
-No.
I, um, this is my voice.
-Oh.
It's kind of cute. [ Chuckles ]
-Thanks.
[ Both chuckle ]
-A hawk.
-[ Gasps ]
Red-tailed hawk.
Genus buteo.
Species jamaicensis.
-That's right.
-She sounds perfect.
-[ Exhales deeply ]
I dumped her last night.
-What?
Why?
-She bored me to tears.
-You actually cried, didn't you?
-I've never had to break up with anyone.
It's kind of difficult.
I sent a 194-character message.
That's two sms messages.
But I think if you do that, people think you're making an effort.
-Well, I never thought I'd say it, astor, but you're heartless.
-That'd be nice.
A heart does not beat on blood alone.
I wish I could rip my heart out and be done with it.
Surely, there are other blood-filled organs that can pump blood around the body.
-I don't know how you can say that when you just crushed a heart last night.
-I cried for her, and I cried for me.
-Yeah, but you loved it.
-You think I'm indulging?
-You ever get bored when you're sad?
-No.
-So admit it.
You find sadness entertaining.
-I'm human.
-All I'm saying is that emotions are addictive, good or bad.
-Oh, great.
I'm an addict.
You recommend cold Turkey or weaning?
-Um, maybe desensitizing.
-Ow!
Come on, man!
Ah!
-How'd you mean it, then?
Hmm?
-I hope he makes you happy.
I meant it as I said it.
I wasn't being sarcastic.
-Sounds sarcastic to me.
-I would never use such a low form of wit.
-You're using it now.
He's using it now, isn't he?
-Hey!
Hey!
I respect you too much for that.
-You sarcastic bastard!
-Stop playing games, astor.
-Okay.
Okay.
From the bottom of my heart,
I'm sorry I headbutted you with my eye socket.
-God, I could not hate you more.
-Now who's being sarcastic?
-You butthead!
-You love me, don't you?
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
-Okay.
All right.
Hey!
Settle down.
And you.
What are you doing?
-I'm sorry I called you easy.
You're definitely not easy.
I was hurt, and it made me nasty.
-He uses sarcasm.
-Just -- you drive.
-Hey.
I'll try not to get my finger stuck in your ring this time.
-What?
-[ Chuckles ] Your key ring.
Your little -
- I'm sorry.
That -- that did not come out right...
At all.
I'm sorry.
How's your apartment coming along?
-Do you spy on all of your neighbors, or...
-Only the cute ones.
[ Chuckles ]
-Let's hope I'm not included in that.
-Not anymore.
[ Sighs ]
[ Doorbell rings ]
-Hi.
-Hi.
-[ Chuckles ] You didn't have to bring these back.
-They're not my size.
-Yeah.
Um, you should go.
Jake's inside.
-You should really talk to cali again.
-Why?
She's still angry at me.
She's not gonna forgive me.
What's the point of talking to her?
-I can be there.
-You know, you should just go, astor.
Okay.
-Oh, hi. [ Clears throat ]
Yeah.
-What's this?
-It's just -- okay.
-You had this?
-Well, she left it at my place by the bed -- under it, really.
It was weeks ago, Jake.
-The idea that mila dropped her drawers in front of you makes me want to upchuck in my mouth.
-Go right ahead.
Just get out of the way.
-Jake.
Jake!
Jake!
Jake!
Hey, stop!
Jake!
-[ Strained ] He's strangling me!
-Stop!
Astor.
-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
-Jake?
Jake?
What did you do to him?
-What did you do?
-Jake?
-[ Groans ]
-It's a myocardial infarction.
-A heart attack?
He's only 28 years old.
-No, he's got to go to the hospital.
-I'm okay!
-He's okay.
-Oh!
-Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
-Baby.
Baby.
Do you have insurance?
-I'm okay.
I'm okay.
-Are you sure?
-Chest pains, dysemia, high-stress individual, probable steroid usage.
A textbook scenario.
-Get him out of here!
-He needs to see a doctor.
-We're doctors.
We can handle this.
-You're med students, and your grades aren't that good.
-Just leave, astor.
-[ Gasps ]
-Okay.
We're gonna be okay.
Okay?
Just -- yeah.
[ Tires screech ]
-You ready?
Left here?
-Yes.
-Left here?
-Yes, right here -- left.
-I can't believe there's a hospital around here.
It's a very residential neighborhood.
Oh, my God, I'm stuck behind a grandmother.
Move!
Get out of the way!
[ Horn blaring ]
-He's barely even breathing.
Could you just hurry up?
Do you even know where you're going, astor?
-No.
Not -- not really.
-What?
!
-I mean, I have an idea.
I have a general idea.
-Give me your phone.
-Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Just take the phone.
-He's really not good.
-Take the phone.
Look it up.
-What?
Look up where the hospital is.
You probably should've sat up front.
-Three Miles ahead.
It should be on your right-hand side.
-Are you sure that's the closest?
-That's all we ha-- where do you want to go?
Just a free clinic?
-God, this guy is just riding me.
-Put your brakes on if he's riding you.
Make him crash into you.
I hate people who do that.
-Well, we have somewhere to be.
-[ Grunts ]
[ Groans ]
Oh.
[ Sighs ]
-Already?
-Yeah.
-Are you kidding me?
-Yeah.
-[ Sighs ]
-[ Grumbles ]
-You okay?
-Yeah.
Blood flow's back to normal.
I...
Might be ready to go again in a couple minutes.
-Have you said thank you to astor yet?
-I will.
I'm just not looking forward to it.
-Well, he probably saved your life, so...
-I know.
I know.
He's just gonna be so smug.
-Why are you so happy with yourself?
-Do I need a reason?
-Mm.
You could've let mila's boyfriend die.
Then at least she'd be available.
-It was a toss up.
Impress her by being the hero or let the opposition annihilate himself.
-Yeah.
You probably made the right choice.
-[ Chuckles ]
-Did you set this up?
-I want you to be friends again.
-Astor.
-Just give it a shot, okay?
-Can we just try, cali?
-I guess.
-Thank you.
[ Sighs ]
Let's all just promise that we're gonna be mature about this, okay?
So...
You walked in on mila with William James, is that right?
-Not exactly.
-So, you didn't see them together, but you knew that they'd been together.
-No.
I was there.
-Oh, you were hiding?
-No.
William James and I invited mila to join us.
-Where?
I mean, I don't...
In your bed?
Like a -- like a...
A...
Ménage à trois?
Like a three...
-I'm really sorry.
I wish it'd never happened.
-I guess it wasn't really cheating, but it was enough to end it.
Three years with one guy.
I actually thought I loved him.
-How...
Okay, I think...
I think it's important that we understand how this happened.
How did w.J. Instigate this?
-Well, he knew mila and I were close.
He asked me if I'd ever been with a woman, if I'd ever thought about it, if mila and I had ever kissed, and it grew from there.
-Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
-I just wanted to make him happy.
-Oh, you probably did...
I'm guessing.
I don't -
- I'm gue-- you know.
-I-I thought it was something you both wanted.
I obviously made a huge mistake, and I'm sorry.
-Me, too.
-But how did it work?
Uh...
I mean, I-I-I-I've had a...
Ménage à un.
-[ Laughs ]
-A lot -- a lot of the time.
A lot of times.
But a ménage à trois?
-Just more people.
-Hey, I thought maybe it was time for that drink.
-Yeah.
-Yeah?
-Come on in.
Yeah.
Thanks.
-This is a really nice place.
-Oh, thank you.
Yes, uh, make yourself at home.
[ Chuckles nervously ] -[ Chuckles ]
Sure.
So, uh, do you have any lemons for the...
-Uh, no.
No, I'm sorry.
Straight.
It's how I do it.
-[ Chuckles ]
-[ Sighs ]
Cheers.
-Cheers.
[ Cellphone ringing ]
[ Clears throat ]
-[ Swallows ]
Ah. [ Chuckles ]
Just...
Hello?
-You don't need my advice.
-Uh, yes.
I'd like to order a half-dozen.
-Astor, if she's there with you, it means she likes you.
-Okay, how do I go about getting more of the rump steaks?
-Put some music on.
Get her dancing.
-All right.
I'll try those.
Bye. [ Chuckles ]
That was my, uh...
Mail-order meat woman.
I like regular meat.
Always there.
-Protein's good.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
-Let's put on some music.
-Yes.
-You want to put on some music?
Mm-hmm.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Chuckles ]
-[ Giggles ]
-Normally, I dance by myself.
-[ Chuckles ]
Come on, astor.
Get up.
[ Cellphone beeps ]
-You mind?
I think my head's bleeding.
-Let me see.
-I think it's bleeding.
Yeah.
Okay.
-Here.
All right.
-All right.
-Oh, I don't see anything.
So, I guess...
[ Chuckles ]
-Oh. [ Grunts ]
-All right, it's okay.
Oh, yeah.
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
No.
No.
No.
No.
It's making it -- making it worse.
Here, let me just...
Voilà. [ Chuckles ]
What?
-"You could get any girl you want."
-She said that?
-This your meat lady?
-I can't believe she said that.
I have to go.
I'm sorry.
Can you let yourself out?
[ Door closes ]
[ Cellphone rings ]
-Hello?
-How do I let her know that I'm really into her?
-She'll be able to tell.
-I don't think she does.
I'm gonna tell her.
-Are you sure you're not gonna scare her off?
I mean, does she know who you really are -- your birding, your loud mouth, your silliness?
I mean, I love all that, but it does take some getting used to.
-She accepts me for who I am.
-Well, if you feel it, you can tell her.
-♪ Set my silly little heart on fire ♪

-Am I not successful enough with women for you, too?
Is that it?
-No, you're a romantic.

I did.
-No, but your hairy tongue did, so...
-Should I go and shave it?
-No, just cut it off, maybe.
-And send it to you in the mail.
-Or just swallow it.
Either way.
-Uh...
-Enjoy.
-Mila said you really like birds, so I brought you here.
-I appreciate it.
-Would've paid extra for the Turkey if you wanted.
-Poultry's poultry.
-Turkey seems a little bit more festive.
-Did you have a cerebral aneurysm associated with your arrhythmia?
-Huh?
-A period where your brain goes without blood.
-How would I know that?
-There's a test they do.
-Oh, then, uh, definitely don't have that 'cause they didn't do the test.
-That's good.

Boom!
Out this way.
-You have anything other than chicken?
[ Clears throat ]
Oh. [ Sighs ]
-Astor.
-Ah!
What?
-Hey.
-And you are twins.
-Yeah.
Yeah.
-[ Chuckles ]
-Uh, trinity, divinity.
-Trinity and divinity.
I suppose you have a sister named naivete, too.
[ Chuckles ] Or that's just me.
-We're twins, not triplets.
-Right.
Okay.
So, it was you that I was presumptive with.
-Yeah.
Trinity told me that she didn't know anyone here.
-Yeah, I was kind of keeping you a secret, too.
-I just thought you were creepy.
-Sadly, I have that effect on women.
-Well, I think you're pretty charming.
-Oh.
Well.
-And I was, um -
- I don't know if you wanted to have dinner tonight or something?
-Yeah.
Yes.
Great.
Let's all three have dinner.
-Yeah.
Sure.
-Can I ask you guys a silly question?
-Sure.
-Sure.
-Have you two ever kissed?

[ Knock on door ]
-Oh, God.
Okay.
-Hey.
-Hey.
Hi.
-Uh, yeah, uh...
[ Chuckles ]
-Jake and I broke up.
-How did he take it?
-Well, he didn't have a heart attack.
-[ Chuckles ]
-It was -- it was really wonderful what you did for him.
-Oh, well, I had to put all that studying to some sort of use.
-He's really appreciative, and...
-Yeah.
Yeah.
He bought me that chicken dinner.
-Can I just come in?
-Can...
Can we talk tomorrow?
-Are you okay?
-I'm...
Naked.
-Yeah.
-But otherwise, I'm good.
-Okay.
Yeah, that's fine.
Let's just -- let's just catch up tomorrow.
Okay.
-Hi.
Who are you?
-[ Exhales ]
-Who am I?
Who are you?
-Who's she?
-Ah.
Who are they?
-Trinity and divinity.
Right?
-Yeah.
-[ Sighs ]
Okay, guys.
Here, let's...
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.
-Ah!
-You all right?
Bye.
[ Sighs ]
Mila, please.
-What?
-Let's talk.
-Your twins are waiting.
-They don't matter to me.
-And that's why you're a slut.
-Those girls and I just kissed.
That's it.
Do you know how many girls I've ever slept with?
-With or without significantly different DNA?
-One is the answer.
Just you.
You were my first, and you didn't even care.
-That's not fair.
You suffocated me.
I felt like a kitten in a plastic bag.
We had no chance.
But if you come home with me now, we can start again.
-Did you break up with Jake, or did he break up with you?
-Why does that matter?
-You only want me now because other girls want me.
-Then go sleep with those other girls.
-I might.
I'm single.
That's a pretty big opportunity for me.
-I'm offering you a second chance.
-The timing is not ideal.
-You sleep with those clones, and we might not even be friends.
[ Car door shuts ]
[ Engine turns over ]
[ Car departs ]
-Come on in.
Water's fine.
-I bet it is.
-Don't be shy.
-Cali.
-[ Chuckles ]
[ Sighs ]
Oh.
It's too late, franck.
-[ Speaks French ]
-What about your girlfriend in Paris?
-Fini.
-I don't believe you.
-[ Speaks French ]
-You never called, and when you left, you said you weren't coming back.
-I was taken by surprise.
I had to see you again.
-Right.
Well, you're a phony, just like the rest of them.
You're half a man.
-Like your friend, uh, astor.
-[ Chuckles ]
He's more of a man than you'll ever be.
In fact, he's about the only real guy I know.
-What about George clooney?
He's a real guy.
-[ Chuckles ]
Later, franck.
[ Lid slams ]
[ Cellphone rings ]
[ Wings flapping ]
-Cali, I'm birding.
You want to join?
-Hi.
It's so great to be birding again.
I think I'm a convert.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Isn't this a funny thing to do?
-[ Chuckling ] Yeah.
-Yeah.
-Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Have a look in that tree.
A great horned owl.
Isn't he majestic?
[ Owl hooting ]
-Yeah.
I love it.
-Yeah.
Here.
-It's beautiful.
You're beautiful.
-They all kind of look the same to me.
-Not for me.
Birding's my passion, like medicine is for you.
-I can't wait to be a doctor, to be taken seriously for a change.
It won't be mila or miss klein.
It'll be, "yes, Dr. klein.
Would you like a free upgrade, Dr. klein?"
Yes, I would, thank you.
-"Is there a doctor in the house?"
-That'll be scary.
I don't know what I'd do if that happened.
-Wouldn't it be your duty?
-I'm not gonna give mouth-to-mouth to some dirty homeless guy.
-I guess that's beyond the call.
-You're not gonna spend the whole night flirting, are you?
-Of course not.
-Just that cali's told me that you've kissed a lot of girls recently.
-Cali told you that?
-Is it true?
-Excuse...
Busy bee.
Uh...
I kissed a couple.
I mean, two separate people.
Not a guy and a girl, like...
Did she tell you that before we got back together?
-I don't know.
Does it matter?
Oh, by the way.
You should probably have a little more practice before you dance in public.
Boop.
-Shall I enroll in some samba classes?
Hey.
Hey.
[ Mid-tempo music plays ]
-[ Chuckles ]
-Jenny!
-[ Gasps ] Astor!
-[ Chuckling ] Hey.
Sorry.
-[ Chuckling ] You look awesome.
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?
Come here.
Come on.
Come on. [ Laughs ]
-Mila!
[ Cork pops ]
-[ Groans ]
-♪ Dry the tears you've shed ♪
♪ shed in the name of love ♪
-Whoo. [ Chuckles ]
Oh, my God.
Look at this place.
-Astor, stop.
Just -- stop.
Stop.
-We should break up.
-What?
-I don't make you happy.
-Not everyone is happy-go-lucky all the time, astor.
-You should be.
-Why?
The world is not made up of singing birds and dancing.
I wish my mom would write "happy birthday" on my cake in jam.
-I've never seen you eat cake.
-I don't eat cake.
I'm a pretty face.
That's my value.
-You're not just a pretty face.
You got a good body, too.
-[ Scoffs ] Right.
So, you've loved me since we were kids because I was the prettiest girl you knew?
I thought you had some heart, that maybe you love me for other reasons, that you would lift me above that.
-You've always been my girl, but...
-But what?
-I...
[ Sighs ]
We're no-- we're...
-[ Scoffs ]
You're actually breaking up with me.
[ Sighs ]
That's okay.
I'm gonna find happiness on my own.
Besides, it's obvious that you like cali.
Oh, come on.
I mean, I saw the way her eyes lit up when we were birding.
You guys have been running around chasing girls, trying to get you laid.
You think women want to be played, that we want to be seduced by technique?
You think you understand women because you've had a threesome?
-I didn't sleep with them.
It's awkward when you can't tell the difference between two girls.
-Do you honestly think call's gonna want you when you're so desperately trying to be a male slut?
-Don't use that word.
It discourages free behavior.
-Male?
I thought that was the one word that meant you could do whatever you want and no consequences.
-Actually, I meant "slut."
It's a dirty word for "liberated."
-I'm gonna tell you one more thing.
Girls want a guy that's nice, sure.
They also want a man.
Your sweetness is charming, astor.
But it's not always gonna be enough.
-Sorry for being sweet.
-No, what?
No.

-So, you, uh, broke up with mila.
Thought you loved her.
-I love her like a sister.
-[ Chuckles ]
Well, it's a good thing you stopped sleeping with her, then.
Been on any other dates?
-I'm taking a break from all that.
-Well, it's a numbers game, astor.
You look phased again.
-No.
I'm just cruising along.
Take it or leave it.
Take me or leave me.
-Like an old couch on the sidewalk.
-Some of those couches are pretty comfy.
-And who are you chasing?
Franck?
-No.
I opened my eyes.
-You sure about that?
-Are you trying to hit on me again?
-I'm not playing games.
I told you I liked you, and I meant it.
-Yeah, I get it.
-No, you don't.
We had fun together, cali.
-Running around chasing girls?
-We have fun no matter what we do.
-Are we having fun now?
-Yes.
We would be if you would just let me in.
You make me so happy, cali.
And -- and -- and if you let go for one second, you'd see that I make you happy, too.
Isn't that why you tease me all the time?
-I don't see how anyone could resist making fun of you.
-I'm yours if you want me, cali.
We might just fall in love.
-Yeah.
And you might just break my heart.
-Could you love me that much that that would be possible?
-Maybe.
-That would be wonderful.
-[ Chuckles ]
[ Chuckling ] Oh, my God.
-Hey.
Hey!
Come back here!
Whoo!
Whoa!
-Whoo!
Oh, my God.
Satya m Audios
- Must be way back home after duty, right?
- Yes.
Mom told me about seeking wedding proposals for you.
I'm also seriously finding a match for you.
Which type of a guy do you prefer?
Nothing in particular.
Feel at ease!
Policeman will be fine, as he's likely to understand duty tensions.
What you said is right!
I'll soon find a Policeman for you, okay?
Police cut!
- It's an injection!
- Poke it
Were you also on duty here, Shenoy Sir'?
Yes, in Male ward!
Oh!
This lady?
!
Beware!
Belongs to a family who are not in good books.
Her husband was freed from jail yesterday.
What did your mother say?
No change.
She's too adamant.
Despite telling her your Nair caste
Isn't even a wee bit inferior to our Shenoy caste, she doesn't seem to get convinced.
Doesn't matter.
What is destined will only happen!
But no...
I haven't given up still.
Let me get mother's consent...
nothing else bothers me!
See you then.
You've become so thin being in jail!
You also don't lose your energy.
Have this.
- For me?
- Yes.
Who are you?
Her husband!
Who else?
No permission to meet a person under custody.
Wait outside!
Let's discuss our family matters.
Get off right now..
Clear all this.
Or I would report against you.
Don't threaten me!
Hell with her report!
Clear the place right away.
What will you do if I don't?
What's happening here?
Sir, he's not leaving the place.
My heart doesn't permit me to go!
- Playing pranks with Cops?
- No...here...
Heck with your pranks').
Move...
- Oh my hubby!
- Heck with your hubby.
Don't hit me!
Lakshmi, you got scared?
I don't recognize you.
how do you know my name?
Though you don't know me,
Ex-constable Sivadasa Menon's daughter Lakshmi is known to me.
I'm Kunjunni Menon, son of retired Head-constable Ravunni Menon.
My father Ravunni Menon was an old friend of Sivadasa Menon.
Which Station?
Not in Station but in Camp.
I'm trying for a deputation in CBI.
I came to meet DMO in order to get a fitness certificate.
Good you came.
Else I would've had a tough time to chase him off.
He is yet to see the Police Department's men!
Anyway it was nice meeting you, Lakshmi.
See you then,
All my father's friends called him as Unni.
No way that you wouldn't have heard of Unni Menon!
By always referring me as Unni's son Kunji (little) Unni...
I soon came to be known as Kunjunni Menon!
Anyhow you're also a Menon, right?
As things have matched well, don't delay this further.
Moreover he has nobody as his own.
In one way it's good!
As there's no question of fighting with sister-in-law or mother-in-law!
Only after her marriage,
I can go to pilgrimage places like Kasi and Rameshwaram, then spend the rest of my life there.
House is already willed on her name.
She also has a dignified job!
Only that much I could manage.
Rest depends upon their destiny.
Uncle, please come.
Two more pancakes would be fine!
Do you plant roses in your garden?
Satya m Audios
I'm afraid we're pretty late.
Yes coming!
Mom agreed!
Had the right thought come at the right time, there won't be suffering any time..
...there won't be suffering any time on this earth.
A crescent moon in the sky, most beautiful of all.
She's the moon ofAthira, protected by thousands of Stars.
Satya m Audios
When a girl dares, she's much fervent than men.
The one who was leaning on the ridgestole away that girl.
She is a cunning and selfish, and have the characteristic of pandunus tree thorns.
The one who was leaning on the stone, stole away that girl.
A crescent moon in the sky, most beautiful of all.
She's the moon ofAthira, protected by thousands of Stars.
- Who's Kunjunni Menon?
- It's me
Baby boy!
Who's Vasudeva Shennoy?
Here I'm.
Baby boy for you.
Carefully.

Where's he?
Satya m Audios
What's this?
Take...
Dad, get going!
I'll come later.
Don't be late.
You have to report in the SP office.
We'll take leave.
Taking charge as Town S.l on 1st of next month, and Dad also retire on the same day.
Congrats You accomplished what Adithyan couldn't.
Till now, other than my career, I've not thought of anything else.
But now, it's time to think of my life.
Are you still waiting for Adi?
If you've decided to destroy your life waiting for him, then it's your wish.
As I shouldn't repent later, I ask this.
After a long wait, if you either come to know that Adithyan will surely not turn up,
Or he moved along with another life, you'll need to take a decision about your life.
Being childhood friends, moreover we know each other well, why can't we move on with our lives together?
This is just an option.
You don't have to reply immediately.
Till 30th you've time.
I don't mind even if it's 'No'
Must be a well thought out answer.
It's too late today, isn't it?
Yes Yes!
It was an interesting case.
When reproduced in computer, I could correctly identify the guy.
It's a case of Lycopodium..
An Intellectual Hypocrite!
If medicines are proper, then cure is definite.
Didn't understand anything, right?
What's the use telling all this to you?
Don't shut down.
I've some work.
Don't stay late and spoil your eyesight.
Satya m Audios
I met Vikraman today.
He attained the goal you relinquished.
On 1st of next month, when his dad retires as C.l, on that same day, he takes charge as S.l.
When I met him today, whatever I wished to hear from you these many days,
...he asked that to me.
Being concerned I'm not left in Solitude,
Vikraman invited me into his life.
On next Sunday, I'll have to reply him.
What do I've to tell him?
'Where were you for these many days,
And the reason for leaving me, your family and friends...'
I don't wish to ask any of these.
Just a word from you saying 'Wait for me'
I'm ready to wait for my entire life.
Satya m Audios
I'm studying in your school Deepika, my dad got me admitted there..
Very good!
My school is very good school.
I shall introduce one of my friends also when you come to school.
Who's that friend?
Vikraman!
He's my best friend.
Best friend means Best, Best friend.
My Boyfriend!
Get down.
Well Lakshmi, you joined him here, right?
Good, they'll get going together.
You come, I'll drop you
Aunty you carry on, I'll look after him.
Oh!
Lakshmi, get in.
- Your name?
-Adithyan!
My name is Vikraman Shennoy.
Vikramanl!
Are you a Robber or Police?
What?
I'm Police.
And You?
I'm also Police.
Let's do one thing.
We shall run up to that class.
If I win, you salute me.
And if you win, I'll salute you.
Then ready" One...
Two...
Three..
Go
Come on get up.
Salute me.
You know what he said.
No.
'You can never beat me you donkey' he said.
Come, let's go
Hello Macho buddy!
Heard you're taking charge as an Inspector?
Only Adhityan isn't here but all of us are still here.
If you try to avenge us in the pretext of old grudges, you'll surely repent for it.
- Are you going to temple?
- Yes
Satya m Audios
It was something which both of us have never thought of..
...Life of living together.
Even after seeing the worries of my parents on thinking of me,
I waited for him.
But he never understood me.
I cannot wait for him anymore and live in solitude.
Despite knowing everything, you invited me into your life.
Henceforth, everything as per your wish!
Satya m Audios
Hey Run...
Run...
Satya m Audios
Mom, I'll be back collecting notes from Christy's house.
- Don't be late.
- Hmm.
- Hasn't Sruthi turned up?
- Yes she's inside.
She was sitting in front of the T.V for so long.
Only on hearing yourjeep sound, she took the book out!
Satya m Audios
Oh Mom!

- I'll get you a cup of tea
- No thanksl!

No, you study, I'll go and see!
Ah!
Please come.
Sit down..
Adi...?
Aunty, didn't you know?
Ad ityan is back.
This morning.
Did you see him?
What did he say?
Where's he?
I saw but couldn't speak anything.
I thought he must've come here.
Although he's back, he'll not come home.
His mom committed a mistake that cannot be forgiven by him!
- I'll come later, Aunty
- Okay.

Has it come out well?
,
Really splendid!

Hiding crores of dreams in laughter, who has gone away after making them play?

None of them come to me...
You better lie down there.
Oh Mom!
You had a pleasant journey, is it?
Seeing the sheen of Peacock feathers, when the young mind is longing, the rainbow made magic.

My dad caught a big thief yesterday.
When the thiefjumped over the compound wall, my dad chased him, tied his hands and legs, and put him in thejeep.
And then into the jail.
Only your dad is a Police...
But both my dad and mom are Police.
Are they?
Can your mom chase the thief?
If your dad was a Police, why is he not wearing the Police uniform?
Answer me.
Dad, are you a real Police?
Why this doubt?
In that case, can you come to my school in Police dress tomorrow?
Yes I'll come that way tomorrow to pick you up from school.
Satya m Audios
- My dad...
Dad...
Dad...
- Are they your friends?
This is my Dad.
Police!
This is Vikraman!
His dad is also a Police.
- Oh
-Yes
She's Deepika.
My friend!
Good!
What if I show a magic to your friends?
Do you like flowers?
Clap all of you.
Clap children...
Clap soundly..
Don't you like flowers?
- Dear, did you like this flower?
- Yes liked it.
Let's continue the magic tomorrow.
Dad...
Shall we move dear?
Come.
- Take this
- Okay sir.
Hey stop there!
Don't run..
- In the broad daylight...
Look there.
Hey move quickly.
Dad...
Get in.
One drop of it every hour.
He'll get better by morning.
Prawns pickle!
Homemade!
I bailed you out with great difficulty, and why is your face so grim?
They dragged me in front of my son...
If thieves become too sentimental, then it'll affect the survival of lawyers.
Kunjunni, aren't you struggling for your son's future too?
Therefore think of his future, plan more meticulously and try to make some quick money
You can later show your repentance.
You may not always find me to rescue and advise you.
Dr. Bahuleyan told the other day that my liver also grows fatter like me.
His gaze never disappears from my sight.
How could I stand before him now?
Stand this way.
Get lost you...
Satya m Audios
Son..
Mom.
No, I don't wish to see dad.
Mom, I'm scared.
Lakshmi I..
No...
No explanations.
It was too late for me to realize I was cheated
If the children had asked me why I had left you... Iwould've been in a situation of explaining who you really were.
Now they understood everything!
I don't need such a person anymore.
My children also don't need you.
Get away.
Rob...
Kill...
Live however you wish.
We don't wish to see you anymore.
Come out.
Lakshmi, come, let's go to your house.
I'll come along.
Is anything wrong madam?
Were there any tiff between you and Kunjunni?
Don't you know madam?
I lost my control yesterday.
I was a bit rude yesterday.
Seems a body was recovered under the bridge.
And was identified as Kunjunni's
Satya m Audios
Adi Ustaad!
It's not like olden days.
New opportunities are coming up here.

Then we will rock this Kochi.

Vikraman has become Moothraman(Piss)!
What did you do?
Hey move...
Move away.
Take the bicycle and get going.
Why are you not eating anything?
I don't need anything.
Take this also.
Dude!
A bag full of money of Rs.5 and 10.
Tonight he will give this money to the money lender.
To repay his debt ...that's what he told his mom.
Why are you so bothered?
We'll have to snatch it.
When he goes back alone in the night, let's carefully plan and snatch it.
Gosh!
Pai doctor is my Family Doctor.
I'm not in this game.
My mother will kill me if she comes to know.
Only if she knows, right?
Nobody will know...
I've a trick.
- What is that?
- Yes, you'll soon know!
Cover the face.
Hey stop...
I say...stop..
What's wrong with him?
He is down with fever!
It's no wonder he got fever!
Always goofing around with some street boys bunking classes.
I'm tired of hitting and shouting at him.
Adi, what's your mother complaining of?
- Up to what time is his school?
- Till 4'0 clock.
Send him here at 4.30 to assist me.
I'll train him to take medicines.
He has a small 'pocket money' problem!
I'll provide him.
Thank you very much Doctor.
Doctor, reform him please.
What is the need to reform him?
He's a very good boy.
Aren't you, Adi?

Even as the golden sun in the sky of dawn, glistens on the dew drops fanning its feathers, fighting and making up again..
Vikramadithyan...
Vikramadithyan..
To reach shores one by one, you strike hard and row with vigour.
And the other sat in the breeze, and enjoyed the chillness.
In the cooing koel in-between, who will weave sweet dreams?
In the eyes, in the speech, someone slowly spins the threads of dreams.
And when tired of fighting in vain, gives shoulder to sleep".

As the night and day, join in the crimson dusk..

Hello sir, you've dollars!
- I'll give you rupee at best rate.
Careful...
Thank you dad!

Satya m Audios
I invite Adityan, captain of Challengefs Team to collect the Runners up Trophy.
- Congratsl
- Thanks!
I invite Vikraman, captain of Sizzlers Team to collect the Winnefs Trophy.
Take it.
Well, failure isn't new to you.
Then, why a sudden walk out?
Move from my way you skinny!
I guessed the reason.
What?
This jealously for... my hugging him?
I don't care if you hug anybody.
I won't hug anybody.
I might hug a friend who achieved something enviously.
May also kiss him sometimes.
Oh that's what you mean?
Eventually after being exploited by macho buddy, and don't dare come to me sobbing seeking my help.
He's not a cunning rascal like you.
Who am Ito you then?
You're my..
You're my worst friend.
Anyhow a friend, right?
Hug me also.
Let me solve your problem of enviousness.
Adi...
leave me.
It's a road!
Leave me.
Leave me I say...
people are watching.
Leave me I say.
Vikram, no.
Satya m Audios
Adi, leave him.
No Vikram!
Earlier, I stripped off your dad's clothes and pulled him to the streets
If you dare assault my son anymore, you'll also learn whatever your father learnt.
Heard me?
Satya m Audios
Don't think you can charge a case against him because of your enmity towards his father.
This is just a fight between boys.
Who told you it's a case of fight against him?
Attempt to molest a girl in day broad light is the case.
And you'll surely sweat profusely in the Court.
Don't do this!
Nothing like that had happened.
Better get going and find out points to defense.
I very well know how to handle this.
When the girl has no complaints, will the case hold good?
Mind your business!
Who told you victim has no complaints?
She HAS!
How do you do?
Fine!
Are you fine?
Are you busy doctor'?
Have I disturbed you?
Doesn't matter.
- Anything serious?
- Yes bit serious.
You were also present on the incident spot yesterday.
If we spare that fatherless brat now, he'll do even more harm.
I'm planning to lock him up.
I don't get you.
Case will become strong if I receive a formal complaint from Deepika.
I never knew Police department is so responsible.
However, let me ask for her opinion too, isn't that better?
I think it's better for elders to decide such cases.
Yet let me ask her.
We can ask.
Satya m Audios
This is the victim.
You can ask her directly what you wish to.
Are you okay?
I know you're mentally shattered.
It's unfair to disturb you in such a situation.
But Justice should be served.
So give me a formal complaint.
Complaint of what?
I've no complaint.
Aren't you aware, Vikram and Adi are my childhood friends?
If any problem arises amongst us, we ourselves will solve it...
Being friend, why did he brutally assault Vikram and make him bleed?
We can't leave him just like that.
In that case, your son Vikram should also be charged.
It was he who over reacted and hit Adi first.
Please have a cup of tea.
You shouldn't have given such a curt reply.
Suddenly I...sorry.
Don't say sorry to me...
Go and say sorry immediately.
Mom, my first step towards my career..
Iwas in that Doctor's house,
God bless you!
What happened?
Your face looks so tensed!
I had been to Deepika's house to get her formal complaint.
But she wants me to charge a case against him for over reacting.
Great lover!
Lover!
?
She's my best friend.
Not only she but Adithyan too.
Then the fights... it was there since our childhood days.
Yesterday's incident was just like an extension of it.
Such a police intrusion by you will make, others think we misused this issue because of the wrath on him.
May be that was the reason for Deepika to react so...
Dad, these aren't in my head now..
Once my application for S.l selection is enrolled,
I'll be onto that preparation.
Meanwhile don't try to distract me please.
Leave it!
Satya m Audios
What was the deal which happened now?
Drugs?
!
Shit!
Narcotics is a dirty business.
'I will never do it', said our Guru Sagar Alias Jacky long time ago.
Few original currencies printed by Reserve Bank of India.
Rivals call them as Black Money etc.
Wheneverl need money, who's there to give?
Don't you know I'm fatherless unlike you guys?
Has the Bridge work on Macho dude's nose over'?
Has the vehicles started to ply again?
His Bridge is completely fine.
He's going to give application for S.l selection.
Means, he's going to become a Policeman like his dad
And you, a robber like your dad.
Hasn't Uncle Shenoy reminded you of the sight we witnessed during our childhood?
When history repeats,
Vikraman would lash you with cane and pull you down to the streets.
One more sight, that remains to be seen by your mother.
Dear Adi!
I had too much of expectation on you.
I was dreaming you would become a bigger rogue than your dad, and become a Don ruling this city.
Even I was in confusion at your age about which profession to choose.
Criminal possibility is there in any Profession.
If you become a Doctor, then you can be a cut-throat Doctor.
If you become an Engineer, then you can be a Corrupt Engineer.
One has to find out by himself the criminal possibility in his own profession!
DearAdi, what's your confusion now?
To become a Thief or Police, right?
If you become a Police, you can simultaneously become both.
Just like I became Devil's Advocate for poor, rich, thieves and immoral people, you try to become a Good Criminal Police.
Satya m Audios
Shenoy sir, not only your son, our dude will also become a Police.
In lieu of one Police for 400 people, currently we are working in the ratio of one Police for 800 or 1000 people
During conflictual circumstances, untiring and hardworking Policeman's, mental tension is neither considered by people, nor the Government which rules one after another.
It's enough if you do as I said!
Why you here?
When I went to the station, they said you're here.
What happened?
Got into any trouble again?
- I gave application for SI selection
- Ahh!
It's not easy for a sluggard like you.
Must be dedicated enough!
Let's give a try.
There are two types of Written Tests.
First is objective and then Descriptive.
Followed by Physical Fitness test then Physical Efficiency Test.
Interview, training...
At different stages, tough com petition to be confronted.
At home, when I heard Mom's advise, I was terrified, and came rushing to you.
I never told this to horrify you.
I know there is a real fighter in you... but the blood in you, will tempt you to derail from the tracks your Dad's blood.
You can thrive only if you cleanse it.
Do you think I'm not aware of your illegal side business?
Not only me, Shenoy Sir also got some hint about it.
Be careful, otherwise you'll be in trouble.
Even othenlvise, Shenoy Sir can't stand you!
If he knows, you too are going to compete against his son to become SI, then...
Definitely he'll grow wild.
You better be careful!
I know.
The moment I gave the application, I stopped everything.
What can he do, if I don't create any problem?
But if he tries to harass me intentionally,
For my defense, I've unearthed some of his corrupt activities.
He'll be in for trouble!
How will you make pocket money if you stop such activities?
Does your mom provide you?
Shucks!
To play with mom's hard earned money is not a gentlemanly job.
For money, I'll take up good quotation works for a change.
In that case, shall I give one quotation?
What?
Has fun turned serious?
What is it?
Police station painting contract!
Never let me go astray, right?
Let me see ifl can reform you.
Here goes your sweet candy!
Has he peeked her?
Get lost!
No use white washing the Police Station...
What is needed is, cleansing the heart of the staff here.
Ah h!
You guys try to cleanse them.
Doesn't smoking ban apply to Police also?
Anyhow don't stub it out.
Gosh!
Burnt my fingers...
This system is a big bore!
Which one?
This salutel!
In olden days, the Britishers made the Indian slaves to do this...
This superior inferior mind...
Can't we quit this even after getting independence?
Who the hell he is?
Is it possible to be devoid of discipline in Police Station orArmy?
Heck with his advise!
Contrary to right of Equality as said in our Indian Constitution,
You call this servile gesture as Discipline?
Officials who work in similar force anywhere in the world, are considered as co-workers.
And there's no question of Superior or Subordinate.
This was a result of Colonialism and Casteism,
This salute, which you guys always mistake it as Discipline..
This humility...
Did you hear the painter's revolutionary speech?
Finish off your work and go.
Some words which existed in Police Department earlier were
'Humble, Master, Yes your Honor etc'
As they changed, at certain period of time these may also.
Who allocated him this work?
It was our Building Owner.
Like his dad, he's also destined to enter a Police Station!
Lucky that it came in this form!
Yes very true, sir!
You really said the truth!
The bike you gifted your son, was delivered here by me.
A guy delivered the bike and asked to handover this to you.
How you got it and who offered you,
And in return how you helped them,
I know everything in detail.
And many more such things.
When your son comes to know, bike he drives with pride is the bribe which his dad got, that poor one's heart will choke!
Years ago, when I learnt that my dad was a thief, like how my heart choked!
So let this good image of yours shimmer like the Moon for time being.

Hello!
Who!
Vincent van Gogh!
?
Decided to toil hard and survive.
And it's really cool!
Where are you going?
To the Bookshop in the Town.
You?
Honestly speaking, I was on a ride to California Sea Shore.
I can go via Dubai Sea shore if you desire.
Come along.
That'll not work out.
What?
Pillion ride with you won't work out.
Why so?
When riding in pillion, you'll give a sudden jerk here...and there, ...with sudden brakes... and never miss any chance of rubbing against my body.
Very sorry.
What can I do if the road is full of gutters?
But you are so confident of riding pillion with Macho buddy.
Yes, very true.
Because he's a good boy.
- Didn't you know that muscle has become outdated-Eh!
All chicks are now behind Size-Zero folks like me.
When I see the ignorant girls going behind men with muscle all over...
Shucks!
What a pity!
Does that mean you'll never ride pillion with me?
.
I never meant so.
When will you come along?
To accomplish something...
With beats, drums, dance and music didn't you post an application?
If that happens, then I shall Ithink of it.
Assume I've achieved that goal, what will you do?
Look at my face you skinny!
What will you do?
Will you...marry me?
Stand before me in Police Uniform.
At that time, I'll sit behind this boat, and we'll set out to California via Dubai Sea Shore.

Come down, come down, come with me, come with me, give chillness along this sandy path.
Dispelling the darkness
Decorating with the spike of dawn,
The day lamps bloomed in this celestial path
Ask mom to get me horlicks and double bull's eye.
Only Egg white!
No yellows (Yolk)!
Mom, brother wants horlicks and Egg white.
Horlicks?
!
Okay!
Eww!
Gruel!
Yes good for health!
Horlicks is the secret of my energy!
Isn't this muscle out of fashion?
This is called fitness.
Exercise not to build muscles.
To become a Policeman, not only fitness
There must be something in your head too.
Give work to your brain also
Take.
Oh General Knowledge!
Don't I know all these?
Please don't go.
Let her 90...
What's this brother?
Get inside
As it was lying down there, Ijust...
Thank you..
In the heart of hearts, again, the flowing light, coming through window glass
Come near wearing anklets.
Foot prints seen in the path, show that someone is waiting
Did a single face,
Did a single face,
A single voice,
A single color, linger in you?

Dude Ad"!
What the heck is he studying seriously?
Lalettan's movie...
Superb movie!
Hey guys!
Get away all of you.
Study!
That's what I'm doing is it?
Why are you here?
Vikram is infected with Chicken Pox.
He can't attend his exam.
I'm free of the major hindrance now.
What a hullabaloo!
Horlicks, Gym, Badam, pista, CashewmSuresh Gopi's film!
Ultimately now only muscles remain in Macho buddy.
Had enough!
If you make a goal in a goal-less post and win, there'll be none to applaud you.
He's infected with Chicken pox!
Don't go near him.
It's contagious
Get me his hall ticket and ID quickly.
Don't worry I won't be infected.
- Why are you here?
-Adi you get up
It's contagious Adi.
That's only for cowards like you.
Don't be so frightened!
Adi put me down man.
Dude!
I'm really sick.
Put me down I say.
I realized only when she told me.
What exams for me without you!

The scorching heat of summer slowly intoxicates the mango grove
With garlands of mango flowers wafted by tender coconut leaves, the fans of cold breeze wake up
In the temple towers where doves fly, some warbling of love brings sweet sounds to the ear.
With the same heart beat, with the same sweet dream, under this same shady tree, will you be there tomorrow?
With the same heart beat, with the same sweet dream, under this same shady tree,

Great buddy!
You owe us a treat.
Satya m Audios
Just because you were 5-6 ranks below him in the Shortlist, are you hanging down like a drenched hen?
And you also scored low marks of Chicken Pox.
I never got the result as I expected.
Adi getting a better rank is not a problem for me.
The Marks I scored after studying hard without missing even a single class, even without attending classes, going for part-time job, and roaming around, he will score the same!
More than me in some subjects.
Dad he's such a brilliant guy, don't underestimate him.
His dad was also very brilliant, but was crooked minded.
Anyhow, only if the interview's 20 marks come, it will be a final list, right?
Let's wait and see what's happening in the interview.
Many wonders can take place during interview.
One at the bottom may come up, and vice versa...
Sometimes, one may not appear in the list at all.
Mom always says guys who dance aren't trust worthy.
Yes she's right!
They're too flexible like this in their lives too.
But I don't believe in that.
Why the hell you guys come here at this moment?
We are running marathon to lead a life, and you guys do a group dance here!
Sam ir will leave for Trivandrum by 12 'clock train.
He'll come to your house to collect this scooter.
There is nothing to think much.
We'll bring it back to your house tomorrow morning from the railway station.
Then, why don't you guys keep it with you?
No buddy, we've a Chertala trip as an Escort for spirit lorry.
Haven't you stopped everything and become a saint now?
Yes true!
Better you guy quit this!
I'll surely not turn up if you get into any trouble, I warn you.
Come on dude!
We also wish to stop this.
But need some time.
Satya m Audios
Search him.
What's it, Sir?
Move...
Stand aside.
Check it.
What's this man?
I don't know.
You don't know?
I really don't know.
It was found in your scooter, still don't you know?
I swear I don't know.
Scooter was with my friend.
Oh I seel!
Take the scooter to the station.
Better get into the jeep without creating a scene.
We'll discuss it in the station.
Move...
What's going on sir?
I don't understand what's happening.
Sir, please don't do this to me to vent your anger.
Adi, don't think ljust came out of hallucination while sitting at home.
Based on the clear information, I came here.
It's also been proved, right?
Narcotics department will handle this case.
My duty is to handover this to them.
In case if you've anything to say, tell them directly tomorrow
- Take him
-Come
Dad, Adi will not do this, he was with us till now.
You should not interfere in this,
I'm bound to do my duty.
Do you know Narcotics George's phone number?
No.
Ravi sir might know..
I too don't have.
I am well aware you'll not know.
Don't you know Adithyan wouldn't indulge in such an activity?
Yes, but I never expected he'd grow this worse!
Bu': when he was caught red-handed"), you ought to believe it like me!
It's so transparent and evident.
So, for the time being, don't come to side him.
Else, not necessary!
If it's kept here, and by night if anybody grows more sympathetic,
True, sir!
it's safe for you to have it in your custody.
You...?
Sir I am really not aware of this.
Don't do this.
Get him whatever he wants to eat!
In its name, let not anyone complain tomorrow.
Satya m Audios
Sir, it's a trap!
He'll never indulge in such things.
Please save him.
Don't we've certain limitations to interfere with Narcotics?
But if trapped in such a case, his future will be shattered.
He's also short listed for S.l selection.
Don't get disheartened if I say something.
He really takes after his dad!
No matter how hard you try, he can't be your son.
Sir..
Let me talk to them tomorrow.
You go home.
Dude, I told you to handover the scooter directly to me.
Why unnecessarily drag that poor fellow in this?
Did you inform that you kept the stuff inside?
I hid this even from you guys as he shouldn't know it.
What shall we do now?
You can never expect any mercy from that Shenoy.
What shall we do now?
There's an only option left.
Shenoy took the stuff to his house.
Before it reaches Narcotics tomorrow, we'll have to rob it from him.
- Whatever it may be
-At any cost, we'll have to rescue him.
Oh no!
Shenoy!
Run away dude!
- I see!
Where's he?
- Waiting outside.
- Call him.
-Okay sir
Sir called you in.
Take your seat Shenoy.
It was a prank!
This is Lactose powder!
Sugar of milk used as a base for Homeo medicines.
Good you thought of testing it before producing that guy here.
Othewvise, it would've been an utter shame if media had known.
Sorry sir.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
It's okay man.
Sometimes we too make such mistakes.
Anyhow release the guy at the earliest.
Satya m Audios
What happened sir?
Drop me home and go back to station.
Don't release the guy without my order.
- Please wait.
- Okay
Sir, Why you wanted to meet me urgently?
Yesterday I spoke bit harsh, sorry.
Even othenlvise, I am always a bit late in realizing.
Sir, did you meet the Narcotics?
I hope you understand the seriousness of this case.
Not for his sake, but because you can't bear this also...
So... a malpractice, that I've never ever done in my career, was committed by me today.
Before I handed it over to the Narcotics...
I replaced that stuff.
Because of that ... only because of that, he will be saved.
But, when I'm doing so much for you, ifl request something in return, you'll have to agree.
Please tell me sir.
What he did was a crime... but the only thing is, the department doesn't know...
But crime is always a crime.
Being aware of it, I won't support to
Oh no sir!
My son struggled so hard to reach this selection stage.
Honestly speaking, it was me who yearned more for this than him.
Both of us earn our livelihood in Police Department.
I'll not let Police department to experiment him unnecessarily.
For an offence, that may get him a minimum of 10 years imprisonment, ifl had shielded him risking my job,
you'll have to obey me.
Apart from that, not only that, apart from us, a third person shouldn't know this.
What should I do?
I'll tell you.
Satya m Audios
Drugs seized from your scooter...
Do you know how it turned into Lactose powder later?
Drugs!
It may be Sugar of milk powder which I bought for Clinic earlier,
I m ust've forgotten to take it back from scooter.
The tortures I went through because of this, was really awfull!
Bloody fool!
It was Cocaine!
I believe you're not aware of it.
If you still have doubts, ask your scoundrel friends.
I warned you several times to avoid that company.
- You never listened
- How did it turn into Lactose powder?
Do you believe Uncle Shenoy must've rescued you?
It was Vikram.
Your enemy!
It was him who dodged his dad, and replaced drugs with Lactose powderl provided him.
He?
I don't believe this.
Don't you believe me?
But he...
You scored again!
If you go to jail, with whom will I compete?
Don't mistake it as affection towards you.
Wait a minute.
This is Original.
Hand over this to your friends.
Hey Macho buddy!
Thanks da!
Satya m Audios
Horlicks drinker!
Poor chap!
Rascal!
A Great compliment from a Great enemy!
Yes he's my enemy!
We've never spoken to each other personally...
Never set out for a journey together.
Satya m Audios
- Must be way back home after duty, right?
- Yes.
Mom told me about seeking wedding proposals for you.
I'm also seriously finding a match for you.
Which type of a guy do you prefer?
Nothing in particular.
Feel at ease!
Policeman will be fine, as he's likely to understand duty tensions.
What you said is right!
I'll soon find a Policeman for you, okay?
Police cut!
- It's an injection!
- Poke it
Were you also on duty here, Shenoy Sir'?
Yes, in Male ward!
Oh!
This lady?
!
Beware!
Belongs to a family who are not in good books.
Her husband was freed from jail yesterday.
What did your mother say?
No change.
She's too adamant.
Despite telling her your Nair caste
Isn't even a wee bit inferior to our Shenoy caste, she doesn't seem to get convinced.
Doesn't matter.
What is destined will only happen!
But no...
I haven't given up still.
Let me get mother's consent...
nothing else bothers me!
See you then.
You've become so thin being in jail!
You also don't lose your energy.
Have this.
- For me?
- Yes.
Who are you?
Her husband!
Who else?
No permission to meet a person under custody.
Wait outside!
Let's discuss our family matters.
Get off right now..
Clear all this.
Or I would report against you.
Don't threaten me!
Hell with her report!
Clear the place right away.
What will you do if I don't?
What's happening here?
Sir, he's not leaving the place.
My heart doesn't permit me to go!
- Playing pranks with Cops?
- No...here...
Heck with your pranks').
Move...
- Oh my hubby!
- Heck with your hubby.
Don't hit me!
Lakshmi, you got scared?
I don't recognize you.
how do you know my name?
Though you don't know me,
Ex-constable Sivadasa Menon's daughter Lakshmi is known to me.
I'm Kunjunni Menon, son of retired Head-constable Ravunni Menon.
My father Ravunni Menon was an old friend of Sivadasa Menon.
Which Station?
Not in Station but in Camp.
I'm trying for a deputation in CBI.
I came to meet DMO in order to get a fitness certificate.
Good you came.
Else I would've had a tough time to chase him off.
He is yet to see the Police Department's men!
Anyway it was nice meeting you, Lakshmi.
See you then,
All my father's friends called him as Unni.
No way that you wouldn't have heard of Unni Menon!
By always referring me as Unni's son Kunji (little) Unni...
I soon came to be known as Kunjunni Menon!
Anyhow you're also a Menon, right?
As things have matched well, don't delay this further.
Moreover he has nobody as his own.
In one way it's good!
As there's no question of fighting with sister-in-law or mother-in-law!
Only after her marriage,
I can go to pilgrimage places like Kasi and Rameshwaram, then spend the rest of my life there.
House is already willed on her name.
She also has a dignified job!
Only that much I could manage.
Rest depends upon their destiny.
Uncle, please come.
Two more pancakes would be fine!
Do you plant roses in your garden?
Satya m Audios
I'm afraid we're pretty late.
Yes coming!
Mom agreed!
Had the right thought come at the right time, there won't be suffering any time..

Dad, get going!
I'll come later.
Don't be late.
You have to report in the SP office.
We'll take leave.
Taking charge as Town S.l on 1st of next month, and Dad also retire on the same day.
Congrats You accomplished what Adithyan couldn't.
Till now, other than my career, I've not thought of anything else.
But now, it's time to think of my life.
Are you still waiting for Adi?
If you've decided to destroy your life waiting for him, then it's your wish.
As I shouldn't repent later, I ask this.
After a long wait, if you either come to know that Adithyan will surely not turn up,
Or he moved along with another life, you'll need to take a decision about your life.
Being childhood friends, moreover we know each other well, why can't we move on with our lives together?
This is just an option.
You don't have to reply immediately.
Till 30th you've time.
I don't mind even if it's 'No'
Must be a well thought out answer.
It's too late today, isn't it?
Yes Yes!
It was an interesting case.
When reproduced in computer, I could correctly identify the guy.
It's a case of Lycopodium..

I met Vikraman today.
He attained the goal you relinquished.
On 1st of next month, when his dad retires as C.l, on that same day, he takes charge as S.l.
When I met him today, whatever I wished to hear from you these many days,
...he asked that to me.
Being concerned I'm not left in Solitude,
Vikraman invited me into his life.
On next Sunday, I'll have to reply him.
What do I've to tell him?
'Where were you for these many days,
And the reason for leaving me, your family and friends...'
I don't wish to ask any of these.
Just a word from you saying 'Wait for me'
I'm ready to wait for my entire life.
Satya m Audios
I'm studying in your school Deepika, my dad got me admitted there..
Very good!
My school is very good school.
I shall introduce one of my friends also when you come to school.
Who's that friend?
Vikraman!
He's my best friend.
Best friend means Best, Best friend.
My Boyfriend!
Get down.
Well Lakshmi, you joined him here, right?
Good, they'll get going together.
You come, I'll drop you
Aunty you carry on, I'll look after him.
Oh!
Lakshmi, get in.
- Your name?
-Adithyan!
My name is Vikraman Shennoy.
Vikramanl!
Are you a Robber or Police?
What?
I'm Police.
And You?
I'm also Police.
Let's do one thing.
We shall run up to that class.
If I win, you salute me.
And if you win, I'll salute you.
Then ready" One...
Two...
Three..
Go
Come on get up.
Salute me.
You know what he said.
No.
'You can never beat me you donkey' he said.
Come, let's go
Hello Macho buddy!
Heard you're taking charge as an Inspector?
Only Adhityan isn't here but all of us are still here.
If you try to avenge us in the pretext of old grudges, you'll surely repent for it.
- Are you going to temple?
- Yes
Satya m Audios
It was something which both of us have never thought of..
...Life of living together.
Even after seeing the worries of my parents on thinking of me,
I waited for him.
But he never understood me.
I cannot wait for him anymore and live in solitude.
Despite knowing everything, you invited me into your life.
Henceforth, everything as per your wish!

Mom, I'll be back collecting notes from Christy's house.
- Don't be late.

She was sitting in front of the T.V for so long.
Only on hearing yourjeep sound, she took the book out!
Satya m Audios
Oh Mom!
Reached?

- No thanksl!
An excuse to close your books, eh?
No, you study, I'll go and see!
Ah!
Please come.
Sit down..
Adi...?
Aunty, didn't you know?
Ad ityan is back.
This morning.
Did you see him?
What did he say?
Where's he?
I saw but couldn't speak anything.
I thought he must've come here.
Although he's back, he'll not come home.
His mom committed a mistake that cannot be forgiven by him!
- I'll come later, Aunty
- Okay.

Hiding crores of dreams in laughter, who has gone away after making them play?
Including my son, all are...
None of them come to me...
You better lie down there.
Oh Mom!
You had a pleasant journey, is it?
Seeing the sheen of Peacock feathers, when the young mind is longing, the rainbow made magic.

My dad caught a big thief yesterday.
When the thiefjumped over the compound wall, my dad chased him, tied his hands and legs, and put him in thejeep.
And then into the jail.
Only your dad is a Police...
But both my dad and mom are Police.
Are they?
Can your mom chase the thief?
If your dad was a Police, why is he not wearing the Police uniform?
Answer me.
Dad, are you a real Police?
Why this doubt?
In that case, can you come to my school in Police dress tomorrow?
Yes I'll come that way tomorrow to pick you up from school.
Satya m Audios
- My dad...
Dad...
Dad...
- Are they your friends?
This is my Dad.
Police!
This is Vikraman!
His dad is also a Police.
- Oh
-Yes
She's Deepika.
My friend!
Good!
What if I show a magic to your friends?
Do you like flowers?
Clap all of you.
Clap children...
Clap soundly..
Don't you like flowers?
- Dear, did you like this flower?
- Yes liked it.
Let's continue the magic tomorrow.
Dad...
Shall we move dear?
Come.
- Take this
- Okay sir.
Hey stop there!
Don't run..
- In the broad daylight...
Look there.
Hey move quickly.
Dad...
Get in.
One drop of it every hour.
He'll get better by morning.
Prawns pickle!
Homemade!
I bailed you out with great difficulty, and why is your face so grim?
They dragged me in front of my son...
If thieves become too sentimental, then it'll affect the survival of lawyers.
Kunjunni, aren't you struggling for your son's future too?
Therefore think of his future, plan more meticulously and try to make some quick money
You can later show your repentance.
You may not always find me to rescue and advise you.
Dr. Bahuleyan told the other day that my liver also grows fatter like me.
His gaze never disappears from my sight.
How could I stand before him now?
Stand this way.
Get lost you...
Satya m Audios
Son..
Mom.
No, I don't wish to see dad.
Mom, I'm scared.
Lakshmi I..
No...
No explanations.
It was too late for me to realize I was cheated
If the children had asked me why I had left you... Iwould've been in a situation of explaining who you really were.
Now they understood everything!
I don't need such a person anymore.
My children also don't need you.
Get away.
Rob...
Kill...
Live however you wish.
We don't wish to see you anymore.
Come out.
Lakshmi, come, let's go to your house.
I'll come along.
Is anything wrong madam?
Were there any tiff between you and Kunjunni?
Don't you know madam?
I lost my control yesterday.
I was a bit rude yesterday.
Seems a body was recovered under the bridge.
And was identified as Kunjunni's
Satya m Audios
Adi Ustaad!
It's not like olden days.
New opportunities are coming up here.
Golden opportunities!
Take off this black attire!
Let's have a bash.
Let me take this off and start up fresh
You just have to lead.
Then we will rock this Kochi.

DEEPIKA + VIKRAM
Muthu, you begin.
Don't be in a haste, I'm just opening my dam.
Vikraman has become Moothraman(Piss)!
What did you do?
Hey move...
Move away.
Take the bicycle and get going.
Why are you not eating anything?
I don't need anything.
Take this also.
Dude!
A bag full of money of Rs.5 and 10.
Tonight he will give this money to the money lender.
To repay his debt ...that's what he told his mom.
Why are you so bothered?
We'll have to snatch it.
When he goes back alone in the night, let's carefully plan and snatch it.
Gosh!
Pai doctor is my Family Doctor.
I'm not in this game.
My mother will kill me if she comes to know.
Only if she knows, right?
Nobody will know...
I've a trick.
- What is that?
- Yes, you'll soon know!
Cover the face.
Hey stop...
I say...stop..
What's wrong with him?
He is down with fever!
It's no wonder he got fever!
Always goofing around with some street boys bunking classes.
I'm tired of hitting and shouting at him.
Adi, what's your mother complaining of?
- Up to what time is his school?
- Till 4'0 clock.
Send him here at 4.30 to assist me.
I'll train him to take medicines.
He has a small 'pocket money' problem!
I'll provide him.
Thank you very much Doctor.
Doctor, reform him please.
What is the need to reform him?
He's a very good boy.
Aren't you, Adi?

I invite Vikraman, captain of Sizzlers Team to collect the Winnefs Trophy.
Take it.
Well, failure isn't new to you.
Then, why a sudden walk out?
Move from my way you skinny!
I guessed the reason.
What?
This jealously for... my hugging him?
I don't care if you hug anybody.
I won't hug anybody.
I might hug a friend who achieved something enviously.
May also kiss him sometimes.
Oh that's what you mean?
Eventually after being exploited by macho buddy, and don't dare come to me sobbing seeking my help.
He's not a cunning rascal like you.
Who am Ito you then?
You're my..
You're my worst friend.
Anyhow a friend, right?
Hug me also.
Let me solve your problem of enviousness.
Adi...
leave me.
It's a road!
Leave me.
Leave me I say...
people are watching.
Leave me I say.
Vikram, no.
Satya m Audios
Adi, leave him.
No Vikram!
Earlier, I stripped off your dad's clothes and pulled him to the streets
If you dare assault my son anymore, you'll also learn whatever your father learnt.
Heard me?
Satya m Audios
Don't think you can charge a case against him because of your enmity towards his father.
This is just a fight between boys.
Who told you it's a case of fight against him?
Attempt to molest a girl in day broad light is the case.
And you'll surely sweat profusely in the Court.
Don't do this!
Nothing like that had happened.
Better get going and find out points to defense.
I very well know how to handle this.
When the girl has no complaints, will the case hold good?
Mind your business!
Who told you victim has no complaints?
She HAS!
How do you do?
Fine!
Are you fine?
Are you busy doctor'?
Have I disturbed you?
Doesn't matter.
- Anything serious?
- Yes bit serious.
You were also present on the incident spot yesterday.
If we spare that fatherless brat now, he'll do even more harm.
I'm planning to lock him up.
I don't get you.
Case will become strong if I receive a formal complaint from Deepika.
I never knew Police department is so responsible.
However, let me ask for her opinion too, isn't that better?
I think it's better for elders to decide such cases.
Yet let me ask her.
We can ask.
Satya m Audios
This is the victim.
You can ask her directly what you wish to.
Are you okay?
I know you're mentally shattered.
It's unfair to disturb you in such a situation.
But Justice should be served.
So give me a formal complaint.
Complaint of what?
I've no complaint.
Aren't you aware, Vikram and Adi are my childhood friends?
If any problem arises amongst us, we ourselves will solve it...
Being friend, why did he brutally assault Vikram and make him bleed?
We can't leave him just like that.
In that case, your son Vikram should also be charged.
It was he who over reacted and hit Adi first.
Please have a cup of tea.
You shouldn't have given such a curt reply.
Suddenly I...sorry.
Don't say sorry to me...
Go and say sorry immediately.
Mom, my first step towards my career..
Iwas in that Doctor's house,
God bless you!
What happened?
Your face looks so tensed!
I had been to Deepika's house to get her formal complaint.
But she wants me to charge a case against him for over reacting.
Great lover!
Lover!
?
She's my best friend.
Not only she but Adithyan too.
Then the fights... it was there since our childhood days.
Yesterday's incident was just like an extension of it.
Such a police intrusion by you will make, others think we misused this issue because of the wrath on him.
May be that was the reason for Deepika to react so...
Dad, these aren't in my head now..
Once my application for S.l selection is enrolled,
I'll be onto that preparation.
Meanwhile don't try to distract me please.
Leave it!
Satya m Audios
What was the deal which happened now?
Drugs?
!
Shit!
Narcotics is a dirty business.
'I will never do it', said our Guru Sagar Alias Jacky long time ago.
Few original currencies printed by Reserve Bank of India.
Rivals call them as Black Money etc.
Wheneverl need money, who's there to give?
Don't you know I'm fatherless unlike you guys?
Has the Bridge work on Macho dude's nose over'?
Has the vehicles started to ply again?
His Bridge is completely fine.
He's going to give application for S.l selection.
Means, he's going to become a Policeman like his dad
And you, a robber like your dad.
Hasn't Uncle Shenoy reminded you of the sight we witnessed during our childhood?
When history repeats,
Vikraman would lash you with cane and pull you down to the streets.
One more sight, that remains to be seen by your mother.
Dear Adi!
I had too much of expectation on you.
I was dreaming you would become a bigger rogue than your dad, and become a Don ruling this city.
Even I was in confusion at your age about which profession to choose.
Criminal possibility is there in any Profession.
If you become a Doctor, then you can be a cut-throat Doctor.
If you become an Engineer, then you can be a Corrupt Engineer.
One has to find out by himself the criminal possibility in his own profession!
DearAdi, what's your confusion now?
To become a Thief or Police, right?
If you become a Police, you can simultaneously become both.
Just like I became Devil's Advocate for poor, rich, thieves and immoral people, you try to become a Good Criminal Police.
Satya m Audios
Shenoy sir, not only your son, our dude will also become a Police.
In lieu of one Police for 400 people, currently we are working in the ratio of one Police for 800 or 1000 people
During conflictual circumstances, untiring and hardworking Policeman's, mental tension is neither considered by people, nor the Government which rules one after another.
It's enough if you do as I said!
Why you here?
When I went to the station, they said you're here.
What happened?
Got into any trouble again?
- I gave application for SI selection
- Ahh!
It's not easy for a sluggard like you.
Must be dedicated enough!
Let's give a try.
There are two types of Written Tests.
First is objective and then Descriptive.
Followed by Physical Fitness test then Physical Efficiency Test.
Interview, training...
At different stages, tough com petition to be confronted.
At home, when I heard Mom's advise, I was terrified, and came rushing to you.
I never told this to horrify you.
I know there is a real fighter in you... but the blood in you, will tempt you to derail from the tracks your Dad's blood.
You can thrive only if you cleanse it.
Do you think I'm not aware of your illegal side business?
Not only me, Shenoy Sir also got some hint about it.
Be careful, otherwise you'll be in trouble.
Even othenlvise, Shenoy Sir can't stand you!
If he knows, you too are going to compete against his son to become SI, then...
Definitely he'll grow wild.
You better be careful!
I know.
The moment I gave the application, I stopped everything.
What can he do, if I don't create any problem?
But if he tries to harass me intentionally,
For my defense, I've unearthed some of his corrupt activities.
He'll be in for trouble!
How will you make pocket money if you stop such activities?
Does your mom provide you?
Shucks!
To play with mom's hard earned money is not a gentlemanly job.
For money, I'll take up good quotation works for a change.
In that case, shall I give one quotation?
What?
Has fun turned serious?
What is it?
Police station painting contract!
Never let me go astray, right?
Let me see ifl can reform you.
Here goes your sweet candy!
Has he peeked her?
Get lost!
No use white washing the Police Station...
What is needed is, cleansing the heart of the staff here.
Ah h!
You guys try to cleanse them.
Doesn't smoking ban apply to Police also?
Anyhow don't stub it out.
Gosh!
Burnt my fingers...
This system is a big bore!
Which one?
This salutel!
In olden days, the Britishers made the Indian slaves to do this...
This superior inferior mind...
Can't we quit this even after getting independence?
Who the hell he is?
Is it possible to be devoid of discipline in Police Station orArmy?
Heck with his advise!
Contrary to right of Equality as said in our Indian Constitution,
You call this servile gesture as Discipline?
Officials who work in similar force anywhere in the world, are considered as co-workers.
And there's no question of Superior or Subordinate.
This was a result of Colonialism and Casteism,
This salute, which you guys always mistake it as Discipline..
This humility...
Did you hear the painter's revolutionary speech?
Finish off your work and go.
Some words which existed in Police Department earlier were
'Humble, Master, Yes your Honor etc'
As they changed, at certain period of time these may also.
Who allocated him this work?
It was our Building Owner.
Like his dad, he's also destined to enter a Police Station!
Lucky that it came in this form!
Yes very true, sir!
You really said the truth!
The bike you gifted your son, was delivered here by me.
A guy delivered the bike and asked to handover this to you.
How you got it and who offered you,
And in return how you helped them,
I know everything in detail.
And many more such things.
When your son comes to know, bike he drives with pride is the bribe which his dad got, that poor one's heart will choke!
Years ago, when I learnt that my dad was a thief, like how my heart choked!
So let this good image of yours shimmer like the Moon for time being.

I can go via Dubai Sea shore if you desire.
Come along.
That'll not work out.
What?
Pillion ride with you won't work out.
Why so?
When riding in pillion, you'll give a sudden jerk here...and there, ...with sudden brakes... and never miss any chance of rubbing against my body.
Very sorry.
What can I do if the road is full of gutters?
But you are so confident of riding pillion with Macho buddy.
Yes, very true.
Because he's a good boy.

All chicks are now behind Size-Zero folks like me.
When I see the ignorant girls going behind men with muscle all over...
Shucks!
What a pity!
Does that mean you'll never ride pillion with me?
.
I never meant so.
When will you come along?
To accomplish something...
With beats, drums, dance and music didn't you post an application?
If that happens, then I shall Ithink of it.
Assume I've achieved that goal, what will you do?
Look at my face you skinny!
What will you do?

Just because you were 5-6 ranks below him in the Shortlist, are you hanging down like a drenched hen?
And you also scored low marks of Chicken Pox.
I never got the result as I expected.
Adi getting a better rank is not a problem for me.
The Marks I scored after studying hard without missing even a single class, even without attending classes, going for part-time job, and roaming around, he will score the same!
More than me in some subjects.
Dad he's such a brilliant guy, don't underestimate him.
His dad was also very brilliant, but was crooked minded.
Anyhow, only if the interview's 20 marks come, it will be a final list, right?
Let's wait and see what's happening in the interview.
Many wonders can take place during interview.
One at the bottom may come up, and vice versa...
Sometimes, one may not appear in the list at all.
Mom always says guys who dance aren't trust worthy.
Yes she's right!
They're too flexible like this in their lives too.
But I don't believe in that.
Why the hell you guys come here at this moment?
We are running marathon to lead a life, and you guys do a group dance here!

No buddy, we've a Chertala trip as an Escort for spirit lorry.
Haven't you stopped everything and become a saint now?
Yes true!

Move...
Stand aside.

I swear I don't know.
Scooter was with my friend.
Oh I seel!
Take the scooter to the station.
Better get into the jeep without creating a scene.
We'll discuss it in the station.
Move...
What's going on sir?
I don't understand what's happening.
Sir, please don't do this to me to vent your anger.
Adi, don't think ljust came out of hallucination while sitting at home.
Based on the clear information, I came here.
It's also been proved, right?
Narcotics department will handle this case.
My duty is to handover this to them.
In case if you've anything to say, tell them directly tomorrow
- Take him
-Come
Dad, Adi will not do this, he was with us till now.
You should not interfere in this,
I'm bound to do my duty.
Do you know Narcotics George's phone number?
No.
Ravi sir might know..
I too don't have.
I am well aware you'll not know.
Don't you know Adithyan wouldn't indulge in such an activity?
Yes, but I never expected he'd grow this worse!
Bu': when he was caught red-handed"), you ought to believe it like me!
It's so transparent and evident.
So, for the time being, don't come to side him.
Else, not necessary!
If it's kept here, and by night if anybody grows more sympathetic,
True, sir!
it's safe for you to have it in your custody.
You...?
Sir I am really not aware of this.
Don't do this.
Get him whatever he wants to eat!
In its name, let not anyone complain tomorrow.
Satya m Audios
Sir, it's a trap!
He'll never indulge in such things.
Please save him.
Don't we've certain limitations to interfere with Narcotics?
But if trapped in such a case, his future will be shattered.
He's also short listed for S.l selection.
Don't get disheartened if I say something.
He really takes after his dad!
No matter how hard you try, he can't be your son.
Sir..
Let me talk to them tomorrow.
You go home.
Dude, I told you to handover the scooter directly to me.
Why unnecessarily drag that poor fellow in this?
Did you inform that you kept the stuff inside?
I hid this even from you guys as he shouldn't know it.
What shall we do now?
You can never expect any mercy from that Shenoy.
What shall we do now?
There's an only option left.
Shenoy took the stuff to his house.
Before it reaches Narcotics tomorrow, we'll have to rob it from him.
- Whatever it may be
-At any cost, we'll have to rescue him.
Oh no!
Shenoy!
Run away dude!
- I see!
Where's he?
- Waiting outside.
- Call him.
-Okay sir
Sir called you in.
Take your seat Shenoy.
It was a prank!
This is Lactose powder!
Sugar of milk used as a base for Homeo medicines.
Good you thought of testing it before producing that guy here.
Othewvise, it would've been an utter shame if media had known.
Sorry sir.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
It's okay man.
Sometimes we too make such mistakes.
Anyhow release the guy at the earliest.
Satya m Audios
What happened sir?
Drop me home and go back to station.
Don't release the guy without my order.
- Please wait.
- Okay
Sir, Why you wanted to meet me urgently?
Yesterday I spoke bit harsh, sorry.
Even othenlvise, I am always a bit late in realizing.
Sir, did you meet the Narcotics?
I hope you understand the seriousness of this case.
Not for his sake, but because you can't bear this also...
So... a malpractice, that I've never ever done in my career, was committed by me today.
Before I handed it over to the Narcotics...
I replaced that stuff.
Because of that ... only because of that, he will be saved.
But, when I'm doing so much for you, ifl request something in return, you'll have to agree.
Please tell me sir.
What he did was a crime... but the only thing is, the department doesn't know...
But crime is always a crime.
Being aware of it, I won't support to
Oh no sir!
My son struggled so hard to reach this selection stage.
Honestly speaking, it was me who yearned more for this than him.
Both of us earn our livelihood in Police Department.
I'll not let Police department to experiment him unnecessarily.
For an offence, that may get him a minimum of 10 years imprisonment, ifl had shielded him risking my job,
you'll have to obey me.
Apart from that, not only that, apart from us, a third person shouldn't know this.
What should I do?
I'll tell you.
Satya m Audios
Drugs seized from your scooter...
Do you know how it turned into Lactose powder later?
Drugs!
It may be Sugar of milk powder which I bought for Clinic earlier,
I m ust've forgotten to take it back from scooter.
The tortures I went through because of this, was really awfull!
Bloody fool!
It was Cocaine!
I believe you're not aware of it.
If you still have doubts, ask your scoundrel friends.
I warned you several times to avoid that company.
- You never listened
- How did it turn into Lactose powder?
Do you believe Uncle Shenoy must've rescued you?
It was Vikram.
Your enemy!
It was him who dodged his dad, and replaced drugs with Lactose powderl provided him.
He?
I don't believe this.
Don't you believe me?
But he...
You scored again!
If you go to jail, with whom will I compete?
Don't mistake it as affection towards you.
Wait a minute.
This is Original.
Hand over this to your friends.
Hey Macho buddy!
Thanks da!
Satya m Audios
Horlicks drinker!
Poor chap!
Rascal!
A Great compliment from a Great enemy!
Yes he's my enemy!
We've never spoken to each other personally...
Never set out for a journey together.
Never played as a single team.
Never even conveyed good words to each other.
Always opposite!
But I know him well, and he know me.
Knowing each other so closely,
Your egos stop you from telling that you both are friends.
You are a reason for that... aren't you?
You're the common factor between us.
That day's brawl was also for you only.
Not even once, you understood how he considers me.
Have you ever tried to comprehend how I consider you?
Am I not tolerating you since my childhood?
What more do I've to understand?
Okay then sit alone and feel the cool breeze,
I'm goir19-
- Get lost.
- Get away you skinny!

With the chillness of rain and moon, Summer fans its feathers.
Sweeter than speech,
Silence tells a story.
Without the breeze blowing in the path, we know its chillness.
Some comfort fills the heart.
With the chillness of rain and moon..
Forgetting to vanish, dreams linger in the eyes in the daytime,
Even if the eyes are closed, someone sings atune in the heart in the nights, without flowers blooming here,
There are better blossoms.
The new soft scent of which the heart feels
With the chillness of rain and moon, Summer fans its feathers
Without wings, we reach the blue sky at some moments
When looking at the mirror I see you in me at some moments
Like the sea in a conch, the love in the heart, when the waves rise and caress the soul.
With the chillness of rain and moon, the summer is here
Satya m Audios
With the chillness of rain and moon, Summer fans its feathers.
Sweeter than speech,

Without the breeze blowing in the path, we know its chillness.
Some comfort fills the heart.
Where did this Samir go?
Here comes a white polecat!
Let me pull a prank on him...
Where's your helmet man?
What man?
Where is your helmet?
- I'm on way for a wedding.
- My spike...
- Heck with your spike!
Are you staring to scare us?
- You know who this sir is?
- I don't know.
Will you recognize only if he's dressed in uniform?
- If you break the law and order..
- Sorry sir, I mistake.
Whether it's for wedding or mourning, wear helmet!
Get going!
" My Spikel!
- Wear your helmet man!
Go...
Go...
Go...
Hell with his spike...and bike..
What happened?
S.l selections rank list is published.
Macho buddy got selection.
But your name isn't in the list.
How can they publish final rank list without conducting interview?
Interview is already over.
It's only that you didn't know it...
Some game has been played in this...
In shortlist, candidates who scored ranks less than me were selected.
I didn't even get a call for interview
I want to know what the hell is happening here!
Friend!
Interview call memo, has been dispatched to you as a registered post from this office.
And it also shows as delivered in your post office.
Although we receive petty complaints, this is one among the trustworthy and liable organizations.
Therefore enquire in your post office for the facts.
What's the problem?
What did you do with the interview memo delivered by the PSC office?
I delivered it to your mom the moment I received
Didn't you receive it?
But only in my absence, you could give it to my mom, right?
I was here only...
What sort of question is this!
Authorization for delivering yours to your mom and vice versa was there long before.
Your mom regularly visited office during that period.
I am sure the registration memo was delivered to your mom, and she never turned up after that.
Satya m Audios
Why are you late?
Adi what happened?
Did you sign and collect the PSC Memo?
When you were held up in that case,
Mr.Shenoy requested me, thus I...
Have you collected it or not?
Yes I did.
Did you ever tell me that?
No..that's..son..
Son, didn't I tell you Mr.Shenoy requested...
No more explanations please.
- Son I...
- Don't talkl!
I don't wish to hear anything.
Oh my God!
What happened mom?
Mom, had you tried to understand and reform my Dad, now Ifeel he wouldn't have killed himself.
Brother!
Mom!
Brother is back!
Anybody else waiting outside?
Yes Ahh!
Adi!
I heard you were back.
Come, Sit down.
Running away for not getting selection?
You may find 100 jobs if not one.
If you're really keen to become a S.l, write the test once again.
If you're still not selected, write Constable test.
At least by getting promotion, you can fulfill your wish, right?
Sim ply vanish one day suddenly and making others suffer?
Good that you came back!
You can assist me until you find a good job.
I can hike your pocket money.
I shall provide you a good Homeo medicine to cure your disappointment.
Can Homeopathic medicine cure anything?
Being with me for such a long time and still you never understood this?
Yes, it can cure whatever is possible!
Then, can you change the Governing body of our Government?
Yes of course.
But medicines to be taken regularly for 5 yrs,.
You're still the same old mischievous one!
Isn't Deepika at home?
Oh I see!
You're not here to see me, right?
I'll call her.
More problems may trigger up in life.
Just swallow them up with ease...that's all.
Satya m Audios
Hi!
How are you?
You got my last email?
Yes!
That's why I came soon.
But...
late is it?
It's okay.
All the best!
Let me go.
Isn't Vikram taking charge tomorrow?
Yes.
Good night!
Welcome viewers to Aluva Vision!
Son joins as Sub-inspector on the same day his Dad retires.
Though it's unusual in Police department, yet we are going to witness this rare moment.
It's an unforgettable day of my life.
And..
I will do my best.
Thank you.
Sir, what do you have to say?
It's a day I feel very honored!
I thank my superior officers who supported me for this rare moment.
And also congratulate Vikram Shenoy who takes charge as S.l today
- Good morning sir!
- Is everything fine?
Sir, this is my son.
He's just getting to know people around here.
Let's sit inside...
Tea...
Tea..
Hello...tea please.
Okay you carry on.
Bye.
Satya m Audios
Good to see you back!
I profoundly wished to see you here as a Spectator this day.
That's why I'm here.
Serve tea for them.
Are you back again?
Hereafter, it'll be good if you behave well.
Auto, mind your business.
Pleasant surprises
I was to attend a function nearby.
That's how I learnt of the unique celebration here.
Hence thought of wishing Dad and Son.
Sir, we'll sit inside.
- Your dad?
- Just a month left for his retirement, he works in Rubber Board.
What do you want?
Wait outside.
Can't you see me talking to him?
Okay then, carry on with your work.
I'm very glad sir.
Hey Adi!
Where were you dude?
No contacts for few days.
When were you back from pilgrimage?
Have you joined?
Yes, this morning.
Congrats dude!
This is Raviettan.
Yes yes...!
Police Association, right?
I've heard from him.
He knows everything.
It was he who handled my verification here through his Association contact.
- Does Shenoy Sir know?
- No
Oh, This Shenoy is that Shenoy, right?
- Yeah
- Oh I see!
Haven't you still disclosed it?
Then, Come let's disclose it.
No.. no it's okay
Come buddy!
I'll call you back.
You know who's this?
Of course I know him.
What?
Adithyan, son of late Kunjunni.
That's correct!
Only in the train Journey from Trivandrum to Delhi,
I met this Adithyanmson of late Kunjunni, the first time.
Don't stand here.
This is how many accidents occur.
Come inside.
We got to know each other.
I understood Adithyan was depressed and was trying to run away secretly...
Okay then...
My address and phone number is on this.
Contact me if you ever require my help.
Hello stop...
My heart didn't permit me to leave him in the lurch.
I forcefully took him along with me.
Wheneverl attended my classes,
Adithyan used to loiter for the entire day.
When he got fed up of it, may be not to trouble me, he took up some menial jobs!
Satya m Audios
As my dad was a Civil servant, naturally, Itoo made my way in it.
I tried to motivate Adi, whose mind was totally disturbed.
My attempt to create a sense of purpose in him, ultimately succeeded.
That day I realized, embers still flickered in him.
I made him join in my institute for Evening Class.
Apart from the time he spent for Evening Class, he worked hard for rest of the time.
When I studied in a serene peaceful atmosphere in my apartment, midst of work, I wondered when he studies.
The day when Civil Service exam results were published,
Adi was too anxious to check my name in selection list.
But never showed any enthusiasm to check his name.
He seemed to be less confident.
Yes!
Adithya!
Your namel!
Congrats dude!
You did it Ad"!
Satya m Audios
That's how certain things happen.
Although you fail to succeed in smaller goals,
Bigger goals will be waiting, only to those, who keep on running.
It's like a resurrection!
New World!
New Sights!
New Lessons!
Training, Knowledge!
Actually I was purging my own self.
At the last stage of my training, as a part of field training,
I had been to Kerala with my Cadre.
Without anybody's knowledge, in the boundary district.
Before returning to Delhi.
I visited my home town, and seen my dear ones without their knowledge.
It's not that I forgot anyone.
Before reaching my goal,
I was less confident to face anyone and that was the truth.
In this Journey of mine, the one to whom, I'm most grateful is... the one who touched my shoulder at the verge of my death, my dearest friend Lokesh... who urged zeal in me to succeed in my life overcoming grief.
Meet your new ASP'.!
Adithyan IPS!
Sir, welcome to Kerala Police!
Sir, he's your Superior Officer!
Only for today, you've the chance of saluting.
Give him a good salute.
Satya m Audios
Let Vikram not know this for the time being.
Today is his day.
Even otherwise, your sweet revenge was aver there'.!
Call me when you're free!
- We'll meet in the evening.
- Thanks!
You're my buddy!
We were the runners in the same race.
If you're not there, then I'm not, if I'm not there, then you're not there.
Police blood runs through your veins.
...also in my blood buddy..
My mom!
Take one more person also along with you.
Her mind was always with you...
Come.
Competition never ends here.
I had just begun my race to reach along with you.
All the best!

(BEEPING)
Well, look at that, Cashew.
Someone's being a bad boy.
"And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God,
"by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
"Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor
"and evil speaking be put away from you, with all malice.
"And be kind to one another.
"Tenderhearted.
Forgiving one another."
Do you want me to keep going with this or something else?
Doesn't matter to me.
I just like hearing you read it
Doug, there's something I need to talk to you about.
You said that she was just staying for a few nights.
Her roommate kicked her out.
She doesn't have anywhere else to go.
That's not our problem.
Well, I can't just put her out on the street.
What's her name?
Lisa.
Lisa what?
You don't have anything to worry about.
Where is she now?
At the fellowship.
There's a sleepover with some of the kids in the daycare.
Does she know about me?
No.
I haven't told her anything.
I have given you space.
I trusted you, Rachel, and you've taken...
I'm not kicking her out.
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)
I could've said nothing, but I told you.
I have to go.
She better be gone by the next time we talk.
You want me to brief commerce...
DOUG:
Sir.
What took you so long?
I can have a briefing ready for you in five minutes.
Don't bother.
I had Seth do it.
He doesn't have security clearance.
Well, he does now.
Mr. President, after you.
I'll see you in my office.
Japanese sovereignty is a matter of precedent.
Mr. Prime Minister, my concern is escalation.
Well, I'm asking for a small portion of the Seventh Fleet.
We must bring China into line.
Show them that the US and Japan maintain a strong alliance.
Have you reached out directly to Beijing?
No recognition that the island belongs to Japan.
Well, I'd like to speak to my team and formulate a plan.
Thank you, Mr. President
- Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.
Admiral, for those catching up.
Two Chinese destroyers entered waters within three miles of Yonaguni Island here, approximately six hours ago.
You can see how close the island is to Taiwan.
Now this is different than the standoff over the Senkaku Islands.
It could have to do with shipping routes.
FRANCIS:
Or the trade war.
They can't pick on the big kid, so they're picking on the little one.
Did you see that?
What?
In the alley.
Camera two.
All units.
White male, hooded sweatshirt.
Duffel bag.
Southeast side of Fair Street.
(RADIO CHATTER)
MAN OVER LOUDSPEAKER:
Put down the bag.
Put down the bag and place your hands on your head.
Stay right where you are.
(SIREN BLARING)
Mrs. Underwood?
Will you come downstairs, please?
Where's Francis?
He got delayed at the White House.
There was an emergency meeting.
What's going on?
I'll explain in the safe room.
WALKER:
The Seventh Fleet is near Guam?
Ninety miles north.
We could have ships to Yonaguni in less than a week.
But even sending them in that direction will be picked up by the Chinese satellites.
We have to stand with our allies.
That can't be in question.
What if we don't send ships?
Just make a strong statement condemning their excursion into Japan's territorial waters.
We still have to offer the Chinese an incentive to call back their destroyers.
Whatever overtures we make,
I'd like to have contingency plans in place.
Already drafting them, sir.
Cathy, open up a diplomatic channel with Beijing.
See if there's a concrete ask.
If they don't have one, let's create a list of options.
Right away, sir.
MAN:
How about coordination with the Japanese navy?
(VVHISPERING)
Go.
Don't engage with their navy yet.
I want to talk directly to Prime Minister Oshiro and express our intentions.
Former Marine.
He showed up at the outer perimeter with explosives in a duffel bag and strapped to his body.
Jesus.
We apprehended him.
The press isn't aware.
Well, let's keep it that way.
He claimed he was responsible for sending the package of white powder to the Capitol.
So this time he really wanted to take me out for real.
Not exactly.
His wife got an abortion last week without telling him.
Oh, my God.
It was me.
Yes, you were the target.
We'd like to keep you down here with us, Mrs. Underwood, until we can confirm he was acting alone.
I'll stay.
No.
You have to get back to the White House.
No, but I can work from here.
Francis, I'm fine.
Honestly.
I'm just gonna be in here.
I want you to stick with her at all times.
Keep me informed of everything.
He's almost done with his shift, sir.
I can put another agent...
No, I want it to be Meechum.
Absolutely, sir.
As long as necessary.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Okay.
It's okay.
REMY:
Don't go to California.
JACKIE:
Hmm, it'd be nice to be reelected.
REMY:
You're gonna win.
Not if I don't give the voters more face time.
When'd you get it?
The Army?
Yeah.
It's grown since then.
Tell me about it.
No.
Why not?
I don't want to.
(GASPS)
What are you doing?
Tell me about the tattoo.
Mmm.
That's not fair.
(CHUCKLES) So what?
You think you can just get me wet and I'll spill everything?
I think so.
(MOANS)
I know so.
(MOANS)
Tell me.
I like the pain.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Of the needle?
Yeah.
How bad did it hurt?
It hurt a lot.
You like when it hurts?
(GASPS)
I killed a lot of people.
What?
In the Army.
The pain, it helped.
Finish.
(EXHALES)
Most I could find was some wrangling with the EPA when he opened his first plant, but that was almost 40 years ago.
We need more.
I want Tusk gone.
Doyle and I will keep looking.
If you haven't found anything now, what makes you think you will?
Maybe we missed something.
I doubt it, but we could try.
You think Tusk isn't planning his next attack even as we speak?
We've been thorough, sir.
He doesn't leave footprints.
You want to shift tactics?
The casino.
We go public as soon as possible.
You said that was a last resort.
Seth, you need to find a way to make that happen so it doesn't link back to us.
DOUG:
If we launch that missile, it could blow us up, too.
GRAYSON:
Not if we spin it right.
If we keep the focus on...
Seth, you're here to listen.
Not contribute.
I wouldn't have him here if I didn't want him to contribute.
Sir, he's been sitting with this for three hours.
I've been working on it for three months.
And accomplished nothing.
It's time we go on the offensive.
What are you thinking?
GRAYSON:
Ayla Sayyad.
She's already digging into Tusk and Feng.
How close is she?
She never mentioned a casino.
But now that I know what the dots are,
I can see that she's starting to connect them.
SAYYAD:
The Pentagon isn't talking yet.
I imagine they're waiting on the White House.
I hear there have been regular meetings in the Situation Room since last night.
Uh, let me call you right back.
Hello?
Hey, Lynn.
It's Ayla.
I just sent you a picture.
Yeah, I got it.
What does it mean?
It's strange.
It doesn't really make sense.
Tell me.
"Pursue currency" would be the most literal translation.
Or "pursue money."
"Follow the money"?
That could work.
Thanks,Lynn.
I like what you've done.
The sofa is new.
These lamps as well.
I've made a few changes.
Yeah, you get so used to a place, the smallest things stand out.
I apologize for not being responsive sooner.
I've been focused on the midterms.
Oh, there's no need to explain.
Mrs. Underwood, you know how much I respect your intentions.
But I've thought deeply about this, and I can't co-sponsor the bill in its current form.
Civilian oversight is too extreme a step.
But I'd be happy to revisit some of the other, less extreme proposals.
You think we're being extremist?
I want to help with this issue, but this bill goes against...
This bill is through Armed Services.
This bill has a date on the floor.
Almost every woman in the House supports this bill.
And I can't be one of them.
So you lied to us.
I didn't lie.
I didn't lie.
I want to help.
As long as we rethink some of the language...
Are you trying to distance yourself from us because of the Galloway scandal?
No.
Maybe you think it hurts your chances of reelection if you associate with me.
That's not it.
It's because I honestly don't believe in this approach.
Do you realize the message this sends?
The only woman in Congressional leadership, in both parties, and you bow out?
If the bill goes to the floor as is, I won't just bow out.
I'll actively fight it.
You never asked my position.
You assumed.
I can't imagine what that position must be.
I've served in war zones.
I know first-hand how important chain of command...
We're not talking about war zones.
We're talking about sexual assault.
How about a military commission to review the internal mechanisms...
We don't need more studies.
We need reform.
Well, let's continue this conversation when I return from California.
I'll be back the day after tomorrow, if you change your mind.
I won't.
But I hope you change yours.
CATHERINE:
China was insulted at the notion we could buy them off.
Well, do I need to call President Qian?
I doubt he would contradict one of his ministers.
See if he's willing to talk one-on-one.
You should know, sir,
Japan is also preparing to deploy three destroyers and a light cruiser.
They're upping the ante.
Have Ambassador Hynes get in touch with the Prime Minister.
Ask if Japan will hold off until I've made contact with Beijing.
Yes, sir.
Have you gotten any rest at all?
No.
Have you?
Not yet.
How's Claire?
The Secret Service thinks it's an isolated attempt.
But they're being cautious.
After the Galloway thing and the interview, half the country thinks she's a baby killer or an adulterer, or both.
But Claire's taking it in stride, and we're in good hands.
Well, it's very frightening.
I can see why you haven't slept.
One of us should.
Probably the one who's calling all the shots.
No, I can hold out a little while longer.
No, go to the residence.
Spend some time with your wife.
You'll come back feeling like a new man.
Honestly, it's less stressful here.
Counseling hasn't helped.
No, it has.
Slowly.
You know, I got rid of Christina when Linda resigned?
I heard.
It's improved things some.
(EXHALES)
But there's still work to do.
Makes me tired just to think about it.
Well, you probably wouldn't be the first president to get a little shut-eye on one of these sofas.
I was joking.
I wasn't.
Do the free world a favor and get some rest.
I'll let you be.
No, stick around.
You should be nearby if President Qian wants to get on the phone.
(SIGHS)
I've always loathed the necessity of sleep.
Like death, it puts even the most powerful men on their backs.
(PHONE RINGING)
MAN:
KC Limo and Bus Rental.
I'm calling from the Adohi Casino's travel department.
We've got a corporate account.
Let's see-
Yeah, I'm sorry, we don't have one in our records.
My mistake.
I must have called the wrong limo service.
Thank you.
WOMAN:
Missouri Bus and Limo.
I'm calling from the Adohi Casino's travel department.
You're not Darlene.
No.
Darlene is out sick.
I'm filling in for her.
My name is Pam.
How can I help you, Pam?
We've got a flight coming in from China tomorrow.
We'll need some transportation.
How many you got coming?
I don't have the manifest right in front of me.
The usual?
That's right.
So a luxury bus.
How many does that fit?
Fifty-five.
Usually about 20 come in.
Should be plenty of room.
That's great.
Thanks.
FRANCIS:
Do you think it's really her conscience or because the bill is controversial?
I don't think she would have threatened to fight us if all she wanted to do was avoid controversy.
I'll talk to her.
I really want this bill to pass.
I know you do.
So do I.
We need Jackie more than ever, Francis.
I'm damaged goods with this whole Adam thing.
No, you're not.
We fought past that.
Well, there's plenty of people who still believe it's true.
We'll get it passed.
I promise.
No, thanks.
Come on.
It's no fun doing it alone.
We could just go for a run.
No more runs until the death threats die down.
That's the new rule.
But they let you go to the office.
Because I was in a bulletproof car.
Does this mean that we've officially not quit?
We've never been quitters, have we?
Sir, Mrs. Underwood.
Sorry to interrupt.
I was gonna head home, but I'll stick around if you want me to.
Oh, no.
You've been up long enough.
Get some sleep.
I'll be back first thing in the morning.
Thank you for looking after me today.
My pleasure, ma'am.
Sir.
Mrs. Underwood.
He's very dedicated.
He is.
It's rare to find someone like Edward.
What?
You never use his first name.
Oh, did I?
I don't feel right talking about her like this.
It's just...
Technically she's my boss now.
And there's a certain protocol.
GRAYSON:
This is coming directly from Doug, which means it's coming directly from the Vice President.
(SIGHS)
Well, I have seen Mr. Danton around from time to time.
Do you know what he and the Congresswoman were discussing?
No.
They were private meetings.
Do you have the appointment schedule?
I'd like to look at the dates.
These weren't formal appointments.
He just stops by.
Most of the time, pretty late at night.
SAYYAD:
Did the money originate in China?
LANAGIN:
The money came from tribal revenue, as our FEC reports clearly state.
SAYYAD:
Let me rephrase.
Did any of that revenue come from Chinese visitors who gambled at your casino?
We have visitors from all over the world.
I'm speaking specifically about a businessman named Xander Feng.
I have no idea who that is.
I'm looking at FAA flight records that show a private plane he owns making numerous trips to Kansas City.
And I spoke with Missouri Bus and Limo, which has transported Chinese visitors to your casino.
Miss Syed...
Sayyad.
Miss Sayyad.
The only reason I returned your call was because you work for the Telegraph.
And it's not every day that I get a call from a paper as big as yours.
But I really don't know what you're trying to get at here, so if you'll excuse me...
What about Raymond Tusk?
What about him?
Feng has ties to Tusk.
Tusk has ties to the President.
You have ties to Feng.
That looks like foreign money being used to influence political...
What you're insinuating is not only wrong, it's libelous.
Not if it's true.
I won't bat an eyelash getting my attorneys involved.
Tusk made the same threat.
If a man worth $40 billion doesn't intimidate me, you certainly don't, Mr. Ian... (CALL DISCONNECTS)
Hello?
He hung up.
FRANCIS:
I had nothing to do with it, Raymond.
I can smell the horseshit through the phone.
You think I'd put myself at this great a risk?
Desperate men are capable of anything.
I want it to go away just like you do.
Then pull her back.
I have no control over the press, Raymond.
You'll destroy yourself, Frank.
Not me.
Thank you for that unsolicited advice.
Work with Doyle.
Make sure we have no weak spots.
I'll call him now.
What did Nancy say?
Well, it looks like Jackie may be sleeping with the enemy.
Lanagin is correct in saying we run the risk of libel.
These links are supported by fact.
Individually, but you can't complete the circle.
I'm not saying the headline should read
"Money Laundering Scheme Exposed," exclamation point.
Just that we present the landscape as we currently know it.
We're first and foremost a financial paper.
Many of our readers worship Raymond Tusk.
No.
So we just protect him?
We don't insinuate connections we can't back up.
If there's any basis for litigation, you can be sure his team will be aggressive.
MR. MAXFIELD:
Yeah, they've bankrupted papers before.
MAN:
I think you should slow down and take your time.
When and if you have a story you can fully...
Mr. Maxfield?
Raymond Tusk is on the line.
Did you put in a call to him?
Yesterday.
EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT:
He's specifically asking for you, sir.
We got off the phone with Lanagin less than 30 minutes ago.
That means that Tusk was the first call Lanagin made.
Tell him I'll return.
Did you reach out to the White House?
They're not talking to anyone until after the President does his press briefing tomorrow.
All right.
Walk me through all of this again, point by point.
(SIGHS)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Meeohum.
We can talk tomorrow, sir.
No.
What is it?
I'd like to put in a request to be on your wife's detail full-time.
At least until the death threats quiet down.
That's very thoughtful.
I'll only do it if you approve, sir.
Have you spoken to Claire?
When she came home.
She likes the idea.
Then I think we should do it.
I'll let Agent Rockland know.
Sorry for interrupting you, sir.
You didn't interrupt anything.
Good night, sir.
Good night, Meechum.
FRANCE: (ON LAPTOP) What the fifth district needs is someone who understands...
FRANCIS:
Hey.
Hey.
You will never believe what just happened.
What?
Meechum came into the office and found me watching something other than the news.
(LAUGHING)
Oh, no.
He was very professional about it.
Were you...
No,no,no.
I was just watching.
That's really funny.
What about you?
What are you watching?
The video Connor gave me.
It's our first state senate race.
Oh, I forgot about that.
So did I, until I found it in the desk this morning.
Let me see.
FRANCIS: (ON LAPTOP) ...been there like I have.
Of course, it doesn't hurt to have a little Texas in the mix.
My God.
Look how young we are.
I know.
CLAIRE: (ON LAPTOP) Everyone here has been so kind, so welcoming.
FRANCIS".
We'll have her rooting for Clemson before too long.
CLAIRE:
Now that's where I have to draw the line.
Do you miss being with Adam?
Where did that come from?
Miss it?
No.
Well, you must.
Sometimes.
He meant a lot to me for a while.
But that's done now.
What about you?
What about me?
Are you unsatisfied?
There's just too much at stake now.
No one we can trust.
We don't have the freedom we once did.
Maybe it's better this way.
No room for distractions.
I don't mind the sacrifice.
We chose this instead.
FRANCIS:
Well, I think the one thing we can agree on is the ribs here are better.
CLAIRE:
You see, he's just trying to get under my skin now.
FRANCIS:
It's not even debatable.
No offense to...
Oh.
FRANCIS:
How's California?
Um...
Exhausting.
Twelve events in two days.
Is this the Golden Gate?
Yes.
I had an etching right there of the Capitol before it was finished.
Took 85 years to complete it.
How long did it take to complete the bridge?
Uh, about four years.
It opened a few months after FDR's second inaugural.
There was a man who got things done.
Strong beliefs.
And he stuck to them.
But compromised when he had to.
I assume you're here to talk about Claire's bill.
It's not a pet project.
There are three dozen co-sponsors on either side of the aisle.
It's a serious bill.
I don't disagree.
Except with the language.
I can explain my thinking, but I doubt I'll convince you any more than you'll convince me.
Putting aside the military's honor, chain of command, all the things that you hold dear,
let's consider one simple fact.
You wouldn't have this office if it weren't for me.
I made very clear that I wouldn't be a puppet.
I'm not trying to pull strings.
But you could show a little gratitude.
If it were anything else, Mr. Vice President.
But not this.
All you're doing is making the inevitable more difficult.
It's not inevitable.
Claire doesn't have the votes yet.
You really want to fight us on this?
I don't want to fight you at all, which is why I suggested to Claire that we sit down...
I neither have the time nor the inclination to negotiate with you!
Co-sponsor the bill!
Whip the damn votes!
I'm no longer asking!
Then I'm no longer listening.
You don't have just this office to thank me for.
If you win reelection, you can thank me for that, too.
Those attack ads didn't just disappear on their own.
What do you mean?
Why don't you ask Remy Danton?
And ask him about Raymond Tusk while you're at it.
That ought to make for some very interesting pillow talk.
(DOOR BANGS SHUT)
You keep up the good work, Nancy.
I will, Mr. Vice President.
I miss having you around.
But you're my eyes and ears now.
Otherwise I'd steal you back in a heartbeat.
Well, thank you, sir. lt means a lot to me that you say that.
Doug.
I'm busy.
The story just broke.
They timed it with the President's press conference.
Connect me with the Vice President.
WALKER:
So the Seventh Fleet is currently positioned near Guam, where it will remain if China removes its ships from Japan's sovereign waters.
I've been in frequent touch with Prime Minister Oshiro and have made personal overtures to President Qian.
And I remain optimistic that tensions will be quelled without any further escalations.
So with that, I'll take some questions.
REPORTERS:
Mr. President!
Henry, you first.
Can you comment on the Wall Street Telegraph article, which suggests- - -
Yeah, I was just notified of that moments before I joined you.
I haven't had a chance to read it yet.
Yeah, Jane?
Mr. President, would you walk us through your history with Raymond Tusk?
I'm here to answer questions on Sine-Japanese relations.
Mark?
The article mentions Xander Feng, a wealthy and influential Chinese businessman...
Unless this has to do with the statement I just made...
It does, Mr. President.
Feng has ties to the standing committee.
And we're currently in a standoff with the Chinese.
Economically...
All right, thank you all very much.
It's not beginning the story that I fear.
It's not knowing how it will end.
Everyone is fair game now.
Including me.
SEAN HANNITY:
This is par for the course from what we come to expect from President Walker.
Whenever he's selling a shiny new car, he can't say enough about it.
The engine breaks down, the transmission gives out, he dodges, he ignores the warranty.
Well, I'm gonna tell you something.
Our warranty is the Constitution of the United States.
And there's no limit on that.
He needs to read the fine print and start answering our questions.
If any of this is true, we're talking Congress, the White House, both parties.
Now, I'm saying "if."
But when it looks like dirty money and it smells like dirty money, somebody has probably got dirt under their nails.
There's no real proof this money laundering even...
But the connections are troubling.
Especially Underwood.
He was the House whip the entire time the Adohi were contributing to the Democrats.
And he's working side by side with the President now.
The President.
So this goes all the way to the White House?
It might.
That's hypothetical.
And by the way, you've cherry-picked the facts to make your case.
I'm not making a case.
My headline is "PAC Money Raises Questions." And it has.
I haven't answered those questions, but I think the American people deserve answers, don't you?
You can bet your bottom dollar the Attorney General is going to investigate.
With the firestorm this is causing in the media...
So what's our course of action?
As your counsel, I will encourage you not to speak to the press until we have more information.
As your average citizen, the longer you wait, the more suspicious it looks.
If there's been any irregularity, I had nothing to do with it.
Your friendship with Tusk implies guilt by association.
Are we presuming guilt before innocence?
I'm a lawyer.
I presume nothing.
But public opinion doesn't have a law degree.
Give us a few moments.
I have to advise you not to have any conversation about this matter without me present.
Your advisement has been noted.
I'll be right outside.
(DOOR CLOSES) ls this what you were keeping from me?
We should follow your counsel's advice and not...
Tell me if it's true.
About the money.
With Bill out of the room, we open ourselves up to all sorts...
Damn it, Frank.
I've been in the dark for too long on this.
That ends now.
I don't know any details.
Feng told me if the bridge project got approved, the GOP would stop getting money.
We approved it.
The money stopped.
Jesus Christ.
That connects the White House directly to the money.
No, sir.
You knew nothing.
You still know nothing.
If the DOJ finds any concrete evidence of foreign money...
Then that's Raymond Tusk's head, not yours.
You've done nothing wrong.
Guilt by association, Frank.
You heard the man.
If the DOJ investigates, it will only prove your innocence.
Nobody walks away from something like this without bruises.
Well, bruises you can survive.
I just don't know how we can avoid it at this point.
Unless you want to accelerate the process and get rid of it.
You could always have the Attorney General appoint a special prosecutor.
That's a terrible idea.
Maybe so.
And given where we are, Frank,
I'm not inclined to follow your suggestions.
Well, I wasn't suggesting it as something you should do.
Just as a possibility.
No, in fact, I don't think you should.
I think it's better to drag these things out as long as possible.
Let the public fatigue on it.
And have it hanging over our heads until the midterms?
It'll lose steam.
What if it doesn't?
I've got the Pentagon proposing tactical drone strikes in the South China Sea.
I can't be dealing with something like this for months on end.
Maybe you're right, then.
A special prosecutor is the way to go.
I didn't say that.
You did.
No, I just meant in terms of getting it off your plate.
It wouldn't be on my plate if you'd kept me better informed.
I have done nothing but try to insulate you, sir.
Is that what you call the feeding frenzy I went through?
I make this solemn promise to you, Mr. President.
I will take the fall if it comes to that, but it won't.
However you decide to deal with this,
I think your instincts are right.
Probably shouldn't involve a special prosecutor.
Send Bill back in.
You knew about this.
Tusk is a client.
Doesn't mean I know everything he...
Bullshit.
The reason you're a partner at Glendon Hill is because you know the things nobody else does.
What do you want me to say?
ls it true?
We don't talk about work.
We're not in bed.
We're in my fucking office.
And in here, you work for Frank.
I work for no one but myself.
Keep telling yourself that.
Unlike you, I don't peddle my goods for whoever can pay the highest retainer.
I'm the bitch to a lot of top dogs.
I'm fully aware and willing.
But you're worse.
You're Frank's bitch and refuse to believe it.
That's not true.
Case in fucking point.
Don't turn this.
You knew about the money and you didn't tell me, even though it's thrown my seat into contention.
Let's say there was money.
And let's say I did know.
What good would it have done?
It means you were willing to watch me lose.
It means I respected the boundaries that you demanded.
No changes, no special treatment.
This is different.
So now we're making exceptions?
When it's this important, yes.
You can't have it both ways.
Were you...
Was I what?
Fucking me to get info on Frank.
Is that what you think?
I don't know what to think.
I care about you more than I should.
But I'm getting tired of having to say it.
He's being moved to a federal psychiatric facility for assessment, then a high-security detention center until the official sentencing.
Well, that's good to hear.
The bad news is we don't want you doing any public events for a while.
My bill is about to go to the floor.
I need to have a public profile.
Your death threats continue to rise.
We can't take the risk.
Am I even allowed to leave the house?
Of course.
But we want you to avoid large crowds.
Our ability to protect...
Mr. Vice President.
Is anything wrong?
We were just briefing Mrs. Underwood on our new security protocol.
Can we actually finish this later?
Of course.
How did it go?
(SIGHS) He's skeptical.
Should I call Tricia?
No.
Could look like I was trying to go behind his back.
We'll just have to wait and see.
I made my case.
And hopefully he'll disagree with it.
This could have been the wrong move.
Well, don't doubt yourself.
Seth has gotten over 3,000 emails in the last six hours.
The phones are overloaded.
So you ignore all that.
I can't ignore the Department of Justice.
What can I do?
Come and visit me when I'm in prison.
You don't have to stand by that door.
Take a load off.
Thank you, sir, but I'm supposed to stay on my feet.
Well, I won't tell if you won't.
And if anybody gives you any trouble about this, or anything, they can talk to me.
Beautiful night.
Yes, sir.
It's been strange not having you around these last few days.
You want me to switch back to your detail?
No, no.
I'm glad you're with Claire.
(SIGHS) I just didn't realize how much I got used to your company until you were gone.
Protecting her is the same as protecting you in my mind.
Oh, come on.
Why do you do this?
Do what, sir?
I've always been awestruck.
People who are willing to take a bullet for someone else.
It's how I serve my country.
Well, there's a lot of ways to serve your country.
And this is my way.
Oh, I haven't finished with this one yet.
It's not for you.
I can't drink on duty, ma'am.
It's not for you either.
Well, come on over and join the party.
Haven't you got sick of seeing my face yet?
Never, ma'am.
To Meechum, for his loyalty and service.
To Edward.
I'm on my way to my lawyer's office, Remy.
That's not where I want to be when I'd usually be in bed.
I can't stop Frank from leaking things.
No, but you can make sure he suffers more than us.
And I say us, Remy, because your skin is in this game now, too.
Are you going to deny?
Of course I'm gonna deny.
Every step of this was legal.
They can't prove the links between them.
What about Lanagin?
He'll cooperate.
It's Feng we need to worry about.
I'll find a way to get in touch with him.
We do have one major advantage.
The public can hate me, but as long as Clayton West remains profitable, my stockholders won't care.
Frank doesn't have the same liberty.
Public opinion can demolish him.
You need to make sure that happens.
I could work with the Republicans on that.
They'll be under the magnifying glass, too.
This'll be a witch hunt.
Then I'll make sure that they pick the right targets.
What you need to do is go after the leadership.
Make them hurt.
They'll turn on Frank to save themselves.
Birch.
Womack.
Sharp.
Especially Jackie Sharp.
She's his chosen one.
Remy?
I heard you, yeah.
I got my marching orders.
I'm counting on you- I'll deliver.
Let's talk in the morning.
The two names I like the most are
Justin Gaines and Heather Dunbar.
Gaines has better credentials.
But he's close to the administration.
We would've made him a federal judge if the GOP hadn't blocked it.
That's an important point.
Dunbar's got grit.
She's more than qualified.
WALKER:
And there's no baggage there.
But she's more unpredictable.
I doubt the Attorney General would have put her on his list if he thought she was a wild card.
Sir, I have to say, I think this step is premature.
We should hold off and see what the DOJ does on its own.
I don't want to do it, Bill.
But my fear is this, if we wait until the water goes from hot to boiling, we seem reactionary, not proactive.
But proactive could also seem defensive.
Like the suspect that screams
"I didn't do it" before anyone asks.
Aside from that, we simply haven't had time to prepare.
Maybe wait a couple of weeks.
No, that defeats the purpose.
Then a few days.
I'd like to go with Dunbar.
Sir...
I've made my decision.
Bill, I'd like you to convey my wishes to the Attorney General.
Ultimately the decision is his.
We can't appear to be pressuring.
Of course not.
Thank you, sir.
The only thing more satisfying than convincing someone to do what I want is failing to persuade them on purpose.
It's like a "do not enter" sign.
It just begs you to walk through the door.
Doyle's about halfway through our initial background check.
Every donor, every political event.
Anything that Dunbar might be looking into.
Good.
Seth?
We avoid any official statement.
Follow the President's cue.
In the meantime I'd like to make some off-the-record calls.
You welcome the investigation, it's the right step, et cetera.
Give folks the personal touch.
That's fine, as long as we don't come off defensive.
I'd like to see a list of who you'll be calling.
Some of this is gonna be on the fly.
It'd be great if I had a little leeway...
Yeah, let Seth do his thing.
You'll have your hands full with Doyle.
I'll let you know who I call.
All right.
Let's get to work.
Sir?
Yes, what is it?
I understand that you need to delegate.
But when you contradict me in front of Seth, it compromises my authority over him.
You can't micromanage.
We have too much to do.
Seth is still new to the team.
I need to make sure that he's doing his job properly.
Well, I think he is.
lam your failsafe, sir.
But I can't be that if you won't let me.
Are you, Doug?
My failsafe?
Do you doubt that?
We're flying full throttle into a hurricane, and you're talking office politics instead of focusing on making sure we don't get ripped apart.
You're right, sir.
I shouldn't have brought it up.
Is she still there?
Yeah.
I told her I was going for a walk.
Look, Doug, I know you said you wanted her gone, but you have to understand that all I'm asking...
She can stay.
What?
She doesn't have to leave.
She can stay.
I trust you to be smart.
Will you read to me?
My Bible is inside.
Doesn't have to be the Bible.
Just pull up something on your phone.
Like what?
Tale of Two Cities.
My mom used to read it to me.
"lt was the best of times, it was the worst of times,
"it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness,
"it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity,
"it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness,
"it was the spring of hope, the winter of despair,
"we had everything before us, we had nothing before us,
"we were all going direct to heaven,
"we were all going direct the other way..."
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Doug, is that you?
Hello?
Hello?
Doug..-... (BEEPING)
Yes, Doug. lt is you.
(LOUD MUSIC PLAYING)
Previously on House of Cards...
The road to power is paved with hypocrisy and casualties.
Never regret.
- Somebody's tryin' to take you out?
- Appears that way.
Whoever it is, they done stepped on the wrong motherfuckin' rattlesnake.
You help me repair my relationship with Garrett,
Dan and I here get the money flowing back in the right direction.
How about this?
I get the BIA to investigate both of you.
You implicate us, you implicate yourself.
He sent them this.
Is that you?
You and I are just pawns, Mr. Galloway.
- How about I tell the press...
- Adam, shut up!
We're giving you an out, Adam.
And if you choose not to take it, I will bury you.
My gut says there's more to Xander Feng than has been reported.
It's a far better use of my time than reporting on tabloid sex scandals.
- You scared of this?
- Darnell!
Hit 'em again, and hit 'em now.
We have to strike back hard and fast.
More than that.
Let's make him suffer.
Look at that, Cashew.
Someone's being a bad boy.
"Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour, and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice.
And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another."
Do you want me to keep going with this, or something else?
Doesn't matter to me.
I just like hearing you read it.
Doug, there's something I need to talk to you about.
You said that she was just staying for a few nights.
Her roommate kicked her out.
She doesn't have anywhere else to go.
- It's not our problem.
- I can't put her out on the street.
What's her name?
- Lisa.
- Lisa what?
You don't have anything to worry about.
- Where is she now?
- At the fellowship.
There's a sleepover with some of the kids from the day care.
Does she know about me?
No, I haven't told her anything.
I have given you space.
I trusted you, Rachel,
- and you've taken advantage...
- I'm not kicking her out.
- I could have said nothing, but I told you.
- I have to go.
She better be gone by the next time we talk.
- Sir.
- What took you so long?
I can have a briefing ready in five minutes.
Don't bother.
I had Seth do it.
He doesn't have security clearance.
Well, he does now.
Mr. President, after you.
I'll see you in my office.
Japanese sovereignty is a matter of precedent.
Mr. Prime Minister, my concern is escalation.
Well, I'm asking for a small portion of the 7th Fleet.
We must bring China into line.
Show them that the US and Japan maintain a strong alliance.
Have you reached out directly to Beijing?
No recognition that the island belongs to Japan.
Well, I'd like to speak to my team and formulate a plan.
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.
Admiral, for those catching up...
Two Chinese destroyers entered waters within three miles of Yonaguni Island here, approximately six hours ago.
See how close the island is to Taiwan.
This is different than the standoff over the Senkaku Islands.
It could have to do with shipping routes.
Or the trade war.
They can't pick on the big kids, so they're picking on the little one.
- Do you see that?
- What?
In the alley, camera two.
All posts, white male, hooded sweatshirt, duffel bag.
Southeast side of Fair St.
Put down the bag.
Put down the bag and place your hands on your head.
Stay right where you are.
Mrs. Underwood?
Will you come downstairs, please?
- Where's Francis?
- He got delayed at the White House, there was an emergency meeting.
- What's going on?
- I'll explain in the safe room.
The 7th Fleet is near Guam?
Ninety miles north.
We could have ships to Yonaguni in less than a week.
But even sending them in that direction will be picked up by the Chinese satellites.
Well, we have to stand with our allies, that can't be in question.
What if we don't send ships, just make a strong statement condemning their excursion into Japan's territorial waters.
We still have to offer the Chinese an incentive to call back their destroyers.
Whatever overtures we make, I'd like to have contingency plans in place.
- Already drafting them, sir.
- Cathy, open up a diplomatic channel with Beijing.
See if there's a concrete ask, if they don't have one, let's create a list of options.
- Right away, sir.
- How about coordination with the Japanese navy?
Go.
Don't engage with our navy yet.
I want to talk directly to Prime Minister Oshiro and express our intentions.
Former marine.
He showed up at the outer perimeter with explosives in a duffel bag.
- And strapped to his body.
- Jesus.
We apprehended him, the press isn't aware.
- Well, let's keep it that way.
- He claimed he was responsible for sending the package of white powder to the capitol.
So this time he really wanted to take me out for real.
Not exactly.
His wife got an abortion last week without telling him.
- Oh, my God.
It was me.
- Yes, you were the target.
We'd like to keep you down here with us, Mrs. Underwood,
- until we confirm he was acting alone.
- I'll stay.
No, you have to get back to the White House.
- I can work from here.
- Francis, I'm fine.
Honestly.
I'm just gonna be in here.
I want you to stick with her at all times.
Keep me informed of everything.
He's almost done with his shift, sir.
I can put another agent on...
- No, I want it to be Meechum.
- Absolutely, sir.
As long as necessary.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
It's OK.
Don't go to California.
Mm...
Be nice to be reelected.
You're gonna win.
Not if I don't give the voters more face time.
When did you get it?
- The Army?
- Yeah.
It's grown since then.
Tell me about it.
No.
Why not?
I don't want to.
What are you doing?
Tell me about the tattoo.
- That's not fair.
- So what?
You think you can just get me wet and I'll spill everything?
- I don't think so...
- Mm I know so.
Tell me.
I like the pain.
- Of the needle?
- Yeah.
How bad did it hurt?
It hurt a lot.
You like when it hurts?
I killed a lot of people.
What?
In the Army.
The pain it helped.
Finish.
The most I could find was some wrangling with the EPA when he opened his first plant, but that was almost 40 years ago.
- We need more.
I want Tusk gone.
- Doyle and I will keep looking.
If you haven't found anything now, what makes you think you will?
Maybe we missed something.
I doubt it, but we could try.
You think Tusk isn't planning his next attack even as we speak?
We've been thorough, sir.
He doesn't leave footprints.
You want to shift tactics?
The casino.
We go public as soon as possible.
You said that was a last resort.
Seth, you need to find a way to make that happen so it doesn't link to us.
If we launch that missile, it could blow us up too.
Not if we spin it right.
- If we keep the focus on...
- Seth.
You're here to listen, not contribute.
I wouldn't have him here if I didn't want him to contribute.
Sir... he's been sitting with this for three hours.
I've been working on it for three months.
And accomplished nothing.
It's time we go on the offensive.
- What do you think?
- Ayla Sayyad.
- She's already digging into Tusk and Feng.
- How close is she?
She never mentioned a casino, but now that I know what the dots are,
I can see that she's starting to connect them.
The Pentagon isn't talking yet.
I imagine they're waiting on the White House.
I hear there have been regular meetings in the Situation Room since last night.
Let me call you right back.
- Hello?
- Hey, Lynne, it's Ayla.
- I just sent you a picture.
- Yeah, I got it.
- What does it mean?
- It's strange, it doesn't make sense.
- Tell me. - "Pursue currency" would be the most literal translation.
Or "pursue money."
- Follow the money?
- That could work.
Thanks, Lynne.
I like what you've done.
This sofa, it's new?
- These lamps as well?
- I've made a few changes.
You get so used to a place, the smallest things stand out.
I apologize for not being responsive sooner.
I've been focused on the midterms.
Oh, there's no need to explain.
Mrs. Underwood, you know how much I respect your intentions, but I've thought deeply about this and
I can't cosponsor the bill in its current form.
Civilian oversight is too extreme a step, but I'd be happy to revisit some of the other less extreme proposals.
You think we're being extremist?
I want to help with this issue, but this bill goes through...
This bill is through Armed Services.
This bill has a date on the floor.
Almost every woman in the House supports this bill.
- And I can't be one of them.
- So you lied to us.
I didn't lie.
I didn't lie.
I...
I want to help.
As long as we rethink some of the language.
Are you trying to distance yourself from us because of the Galloway scandal?
- No.
- Maybe you think it hurts your chances
- of reelection if you associate with me.
- That's not it.
It's because I honestly don't believe in this approach.
Do you realize the message this sends?
The only woman in congressional leadership in both parties, and you bow out?
If the bill goes to the floor as is, I won't just bow out.
I'll actively fight it.
You never asked my position.
You assumed.
I can't imagine what that position must be.
I've served in war zones, I know firsthand how important...
We're not talking about war zones.
We're talking about sexual assault.
How about a military commission to review the internal...
We don't need more studies, we need reform.
Well, let's continue this conversation when I return from California.
I'll be back the day after tomorrow if you change your mind.
I won't, but I hope you change yours.
China was insulted at the notion that we could buy them off.
Do I need to call President Qian?
I doubt he would contradict one of his ministers.
See if he's willing to talk one-on-one.
You should know, sir, Japan is also preparing to deploy three destroyers and a light cruiser.
They're upping the ante.
Have Ambassador Hines get in touch with the prime minister, and ask if Japan will hold off until I make contact with Beijing.
Yes, sir.
Have you gotten any rest at all?
- No, have you?
- No, not yet.
How's Claire?
Secret Service thinks it's an isolated attempt, but they're being cautious.
After the Galloway thing and the interview, half the country thinks she's a baby killer, or an adulterer, or both.
But Claire's taking it in stride.
We're in good hands.
That's very frightening.
I can see why you haven't slept.
One of us should, probably the one that's calling all the shots.
No, I can hold out a little while longer.
No, go to the residence, spend some time with your wife.
You'll come back feeling like a new man.
Honestly, it's less stressful here.
- Counseling hasn't helped?
- No, it has... slowly.
- I got rid of Christina when Linda resigned.
- I heard.
It's improved things some, but there's still work to do.
Makes me tired just to think about it.
Well, you probably wouldn't be the first president to get a little shut-eye on one of these sofas.
- I was joking.
- I wasn't.
Do the free world a favor and get some rest.
- I'll let you be.
- No, stick around.
You should be nearby if President Qian wants to get on the phone.
I've always loathed the necessity of sleep.
Like death, it puts the most powerful men on their backs.
DC Limo and Bus Rental.
I'm calling from the Adohi Casino's travel department.
We've got a corporate account.
Let's see...
I'm sorry, we don't have one in our records.
My mistake.
I must've called the wrong limo service.
Thank you.
Missouri Bus and Limo.
I'm calling from the Adohi Casino's travel department.
- You're not Darlene.
- No, Darlene is out sick.
I'm filling in for her.
My name is Pam.
How can I help you, Pam?
We've got a flight coming in from China tomorrow.
We'll need some transportation.
How many you got coming?
I don't have the manifest right in front of me.
- The usual?
- That's right.
- So a luxury bus.
- How many does that fit?
Fifty-five, usually about 20 come in.
Should be plenty of room.
That's great, thanks.
Do you think it's really her conscience, or because the bill's controversial?
I don't think she would have threatened to fight us if all she wanted to do was avoid controversy.
I'll talk to her.
I really want this bill to pass.
I know you do, so do I.
We need Jackie more than ever, Francis.
I'm damaged goods, this whole Adam thing.
No, you're not.
We fought past that.
Well, there's plenty of people who still believe it's true.
We'll get it passed, I promise.
- No, thanks.
- Come on.
It's no fun doing it alone.
We could just go for a run.
No more runs until the death threats die down, that's the new rule.
But they let you go to the office.
Because I was in a bulletproof car.
Does this mean we've officially not quit?
We've never been quitters, have we?
Sir, Mrs. Underwood, sorry to interrupt.
I was gonna head home, but I'll stick around if you want me to.
Oh, no.
You've been up long enough.
Get some sleep.
I'll be back first thing in the morning.
Thank you for looking after me today.
My pleasure, ma'am.
Sir, Mrs. Underwood.
- He's very dedicated.
- He is.
It's rare to find someone like Edward.
- What?
- You never use his first name.
Oh, did I?
I don't feel right talking about her like this.
It's just... technically, she's my boss now.
- There's a certain protocol.
- This is coming directly from Doug.
Which means it's coming directly from the vice president.
Well, um, I have seen Mr. Danton around from time to time.
Do you know what he and the congresswoman were discussing?
No, they were private meetings.
Do you have the appointment schedule?
I'd like to look at the dates.
These weren't formal appointments.
He just stops by.
Most of the time pretty late at night.
Did the money originate in China?
The money came from tribal revenue.
As our FEC reports clearly stated.
Let me rephrase.
Did any of that revenue come from Chinese visitors who gambled at your casino?
We have visitors from all over the world.
I'm speaking specifically about a businessman named Xander Feng.
I have no idea who that is.
I'm looking at FAA flight records that show a private plane he owns making numerous trips to Kansas City.
And I spoke with Missouri Bus and Limo, which has transported Chinese visitors to your casino.
- Ms. Said...
- Sayyad.
Ms. Sayyad, the only reason I returned your call was because you work for The Telegraph.
It's not every day that I get a call from a paper as big as yours.
But I don't know what you're trying to get at here, so if you'll excuse...
What about Raymond Tusk?
- What about him?
- Feng has ties to Tusk.
Tusk has ties to the president.
You have ties to Feng.
That looks like foreign money being used to influence political...
What you're insinuating is not only wrong,
- it's libelous.
- Not if it's true.
I won't bat an eyelash getting my attorneys involved.
Tusk made the same threat.
If a man worth 40 billion dollars doesn't intimidate me, you certainly don't, Mr. Lana...
Hello?
He hung up.
I had nothing to do with it, Raymond.
I can smell the horseshit through the phone.
You think I'd put myself at this great a risk?
Desperate men are capable of anything.
- I want it to go away, just like you do.
- Then pull her back.
I have no control over the press, Raymond.
You'll destroy yourself, Frank, not me.
Thank you for that unsolicited advice.
Work with Doyle, make sure we have no weak spots.
- I'll call him now.
- What did Nancy say?
Well, it looks like Jackie may be sleeping with the enemy.
Lanagin is correct in saying we run the risk of libel.
These links are supported by fact.
Individually, but you can't complete the circle.
I'm not saying the headline should read:
Money Laundering Scheme Exposed!
Just that we present the landscape as we currently know it.
We're first and foremost a financial paper.
Many of our readers worship Raymond Tusk.
So we just protect him?
We don't insinuate connections we can't back up.
If there's any basis for litigation, you can be sure his team will be aggressive.
They've bankrupted papers before.
I think you should slow down and take your time.
When, and if, you have a story...
Mr. Maxfield, Raymond Tusk is on the line.
- Did you put in a call to him?
- Yesterday.
He's specifically asking for you, sir.
We got off the phone with Lanagin less than 30 minutes ago.
That means Tusk was the first call Lanagin made.
Tell him I'll return.
Did you reach out to the White House?
They're not talking to anyone until after the president does his press briefing tomorrow.
All right, walk me through all of this again, point by point.
- Meechum.
- We can talk tomorrow, sir.
No.
What is it?
I'd like to put in a request to be on your wife's detail full time.
At least until the death threats quiet down.
That's very thoughtful.
I'll only do it if you approve, sir.
- Have you spoken to Claire?
- When she came home.
- She likes the idea.
- Then I think we should do it.
I'll let Agent Rockland know.
Sorry for interrupting you, sir.
You didn't interrupt anything.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Meechum.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You'll never believe what just happened.
- What?
- Meechum came into the office and found me watching something...
- ...other than the news.
- Oh!
- Oh, no.
- He was very professional about it.
- Were you...?
- No, no.
I was just watching.
That's really funny.
What about you?
What are you watching?
The video Connor gave me.
It's our first state senate race.
I forgot about that.
So did I, until I found it in the desk this morning.
Let me see.
...been there, like I have.
Of course, it doesn't hurt to have a little Texas in them...
My God, look how young we are.
I know.
Everyone here has been so kind, and so welcoming.
We'll have her rooting for Clemson before too long.
That's where I have to draw the line.
Do you miss being with Adam?
Where did that come from?
Miss it?
No.
Well, you must, sometimes.
He meant a lot to me for a while.
But that's done now.
What about you?
What about me?
Are you unsatisfied?
There's just too much at stake now.
No one we can trust.
We don't have the freedom we once did.
Maybe it's better this way.
No room for distractions.
I don't mind the sacrifice.
We chose this instead.
I think the one thing we can agree on is the ribs here are better.
See, he's just trying to get under my skin.
No, it's not even debatable...
- How was California?
- Oh...
Exhausting.
Twelve events in two days.
- Is this the Golden Gate?
- Yes.
I had an etching right there.
The capitol before it was finished.
Took 85 years to complete it.
- How long did it take to complete the bridge?
- About four years.
It opened a few months after FDR's second inaugural.
There was a man who got things done.
Strong beliefs and he stuck to them.
But compromised when he had to.
I assume you're here to talk about Claire's bill.
It's not a pet project.
There are three dozen cosponsors on either side of the aisle.
- It's a serious bill.
- I don't disagree.
- Except with the language.
- I can explain my thinking, but I doubt I'll convince you anymore...
Putting aside the military's honor, chain of command, all the things that you hold dear let's consider one simple fact.
You wouldn't have this office if it weren't for me.
I made very clear that I wouldn't be a puppet.
I'm not trying to pull strings, but you could show a little gratitude.
If it were anything else, Mr. Vice President... but not this.
All you're doing is making the inevitable more difficult.
It's not inevitable.
Claire doesn't have the votes yet.
You really want to fight us on this.
I don't want to fight you at all.
Which is why I suggested to Claire that we sit down...
I neither have the time nor the inclination to negotiate with you!
Cosponsor the bill, whip the damn votes, I'm no longer asking.
Then I'm no longer listening.
You don't have just this office to thank me for.
If you win reelection, you can thank me for that, too.
Those attack ads didn't just disappear on their own.
- What do you mean?
- Why don't you ask Remy Danton.
And ask him about Raymond Tusk while you're at it.
That ought to make for some very interesting pillow talk.
You keep up the good work, Nancy.
I will, Mr. Vice President.
I miss having you around, but you're my eyes and ears now, otherwise I'd steal you back in a heartbeat.
Well, thank you, sir.
It means a lot to me that you say that.
- Doug?
- I'm busy.
The story just broke.
They timed it with the president's press conference.
Connect me with the vice president.
So the 7th Fleet is currently positioned near Guam, where it will remain if China removes its ships from Japan's sovereign waters.
I've been in frequent touch with prime minister Oshiro, and have made personal overtures to President Qian.
And I remain optimistic that tensions will be quelled without any further escalations.
So, with that, I'll take some questions.
- Henry, you first.
- Can you comment on the Wall Street Telegraph article...
I was just notified of that moments before I joined you.
I haven't had a chance to read it yet.
Yeah, Jane.
Mr. President, would you walk us through your history with Raymond Tusk?
I'm here to answer questions on Sino-Japanese relations.
Mark.
The article mentions Xander Feng, a wealthy and influential Chinese business...
Unless this has to do with the statement I just made...
It does, Mr. President.
Feng has ties to the standing committee and we're currently in a standoff with the Chinese.
Economically...
Thank you all very much.
It's not beginning the story that I fear, it's not knowing how it will end.
Everyone is fair game now, including me.
This is par for the course, what we've come to expect from President Walker.
Whenever he's selling a shiny new car, he can't say enough about it.
The engine breaks down, the transmission gives out, he dodges, he ignores the warranty.
I'm gonna tell you something, our warranty is the Constitution of the United States, and there's no limit on that.
He needs to read the fine print and start answering our questions.
If any of this is true, we're talking Congress, the White House, both parties...
Now, I'm saying "if,"
but when it look like dirty money, and it smells like dirty money, somebody has probably got dirt under their nails.
Look, there's no real proof this money laundering is even...
The connections are troubling, especially Underwood.
He was the House whip the entire time Adohi were contributing to the Democrats, and he's working side by side with the president now.
The president.
So this goes all the way to the White House?
- It might.
- It's hypothetical.
And by the way, you've cherry-picked the facts to make your case.
I'm not making a case.
PAC Money Raises Questions.
And it has.
I haven't answered those questions, but I think the American people deserve answers.
Don't you?
You can bet your bottom dollar the attorney general is gonna investigate.
- With the firestorm this is causing in the media...
- What's our course of action?
As your counsel, I would encourage you not to speak to the press until we have more information.
As your average citizen, the longer you wait, the more suspicious it looks.
If there's been any irregularity, I had nothing to do with it.
Your friendship with Tusk implies guilt by association.
Are we presuming guilt before innocence?
I'm a lawyer, I presume nothing.
But public opinion doesn't have a law degree.
Give us a few moments.
I have to advise you not to have any conversation about this matter
- without me present.
- Your advisement has been noted.
I'll be right outside.
Is this what you were keeping from me?
We should follow your counsel's advice
- and not...
- Tell me if it's true, about the money.
With Bill out of the room, we open ourselves up to...
Damn it, Frank!
I've been in the dark too long on this.
That ends now.
I don't know any details.
Feng told me if the Bridge project got approved, the GOP would stop getting money.
We approved it, the money stopped.
Jesus Christ, that connects the White House directly to the money.
No, sir.
You knew nothing, you still know nothing.
If the DOJ finds any concrete evidence of foreign money...
That's Raymond Tusk's head, not yours.
You've done nothing wrong.
Guilt by association, Frank.
You heard the man.
If the DOJ investigates, it will only prove your innocence.
Nobody walks away from something like this without bruises.
Well, bruises you can survive.
I just don't know how we can avoid it at this point.
Unless you want to accelerate the process and get rid of it.
We could always have the attorney general appoint a special prosecutor.
- That's a terrible idea.
- Maybe so.
And given where we are, Frank, I'm not inclined to follow your suggestions.
Well, I wasn't suggesting it was something you should do.
Just as a possibility.
No, in fact, I don't think you should.
I think it's better to drag these things out as long as possible.
- Let the public fatigue on it.
- And have it hanging over our heads until the midterms?
- It'll lose steam.
- What if it doesn't.
I've got the Pentagon proposing tactical drone strikes in the South China Sea.
I can't be dealing with something like this for months on end.
Maybe you're right then.
A special prosecutor is the way to go.
I didn't say that, you did.
Oh, no.
I just meant in terms of getting it off your plate.
It wouldn't be on my plate if you kept me better informed.
I have done nothing but try to insulate you, sir.
Is that what you call the feeding frenzy I just went through?
I make this solemn promise to you, Mr. President.
I will take the fall if it comes to that, but it won't.
However you decide to deal with this, I think your instincts are right.
We probably shouldn't involve a special prosecutor.
Send Bill back in.
You knew about this.
Tusk is a client, doesn't mean I know everything...
Bullshit.
The reason you're a partner at Glendon Hill is because you know the things nobody else does.
What do you want me to say?
- Is it true?
- We don't talk about work.
We're not in bed, we're in my fucking office.
And in here, you work for Frank.
- I work for no one but myself.
- Keep telling yourself that.
Unlike you, I don't peddle my goods for whoever can pay the highest retainer.
I'm the bitch to a lot of top dogs, I'm fully aware and willing, but you're worse.
You're Frank's bitch and refuse to believe it.
- That's not true.
- Case in fucking point.
Don't turn this.
You knew about the money and you didn't tell me.
Even though it's thrown my seat into contention.
Let's say there was money, and let's say I did know,
- what good would it have done?
- It means you were willing to watch me lose!
It means I respected the boundaries that you demanded.
- No changes, no special treatment.
- This is different!
- So now we're making exceptions?
- When it's this important, yes!
You can't have it both ways.
Were you...?
Was I what?
...fucking me to get info on Frank?
- Is that what you think?
- I don't know what to think.
I care about you more than I should.
But I'm getting tired of having to say it.
He's being moved to a federal psychiatric facility for assessment.
Then a high security detention center until the official sentencing.
Well, that's good to hear.
The bad news is we don't want you doing any public events for a while.
My bill's about to go to the floor.
I need to have a public profile.
Your death threats continue to rise.
We can't take the risk.
- Am I even allowed to leave the house?
- Of course.
But we want you to avoid large crowds.
Our ability to protect...
Mr. Vice President.
- Anything wrong?
- We were just briefing Mrs. Underwood on her new security protocol.
- Can we actually finish this later?
- Of course.
How did it go?
- He's skeptical.
- Should I call Tricia?
No.
It could look like I was trying to go behind his back.
We'll just have to wait and see.
I made my case.
Hopefully, he'll disagree with it.
But this could've been the wrong move.
Well, don't doubt yourself.
Seth has gotten over 3,000 e-mails in the last six hours.
- The phones are overloaded.
- So you ignore all that?
I can't ignore the Department of Justice.
What can I do?
Come and visit me when I'm in prison.
You don't have to stand by that door.
Take a load off.
Thank you, sir, but I'm supposed to stay on my feet.
Well, I won't tell if you won't.
And if anybody gives you any trouble about this, or anything, they can talk to me.
- Beautiful night.
- Yes, sir.
It's been strange not having you around these last few days.
You want me to switch back to your detail?
No, no.
I'm glad you're with Claire.
I just didn't realize how much I got used to your company until you were gone.
Protecting her is the same as protecting you, in my mind.
Oh, come on.
- Why do you do this?
- Do what, sir?
I've always been awestruck, people who are willing to take a bullet for someone else.
- That's how I serve my country.
- Well, there's a lot of ways to serve your country.
And this is my way.
- I haven't finished with this one yet.
- It's not for you.
I can't drink on duty, ma'am.
It's not for you either.
Well, come on over and join the party.
Haven't you got sick of seeing my face yet?
Never, ma'am.
To Meechum, for his loyalty and service.
To Edward.
I'm on my way to my lawyer's office, Remy.
That's not where I want to be when I'd usually be in bed.
I can't stop Frank from leaking things.
No, but you can make sure he suffers more than us.
And I say "us," Remy, because your skin is in this game now, too.
- Are you gonna deny?
- Of course I'm gonna deny.
Every step of this was legal.
They can't prove the links between them.
- What about Lanagin?
- He'll cooperate.
It's Feng we need to worry about.
I'll find a way to get in touch with him.
We do have one major advantage.
The public can hate me, but as long as Clayton West remains profitable, my stockholders won't care.
Frank doesn't have the same liberty.
Public opinion can demolish him.
You need to make sure that happens.
I can work with the Republicans on that.
Well, we'll be under the magnifying glass too.
This will be a witch hunt.
I'll make sure that they pick the right targets.
What you need to do is go after the leadership.
Make them hurt.
They'll turn on Frank to save themselves.
Birch, Womack, Sharp.
Especially Jackie Sharp.
She's his chosen one.
- Remy?
- I heard you.
I got my marching orders.
- I'm counting on you.
- I'll deliver.
Let's talk in the morning.
The two names I like the most are Justin Gaines and Heather Dunbar.
Gaines has better credentials.
But he's close to the administration.
I would've made him a federal judge if the GOP hadn't blocked it.
That's an important point.
Dunbar's got grit.
- She's more than qualified.
- No baggage there?
- She's more unpredictable.
- I doubt the attorney general would've put her on his list if he thought she was a wild card.
Sir, I have to say, I think this step is premature.
We should hold off and see what the DOJ does on its own.
I don't want to do it, Bill, but my fear is this:
if we wait until the water goes from hot to boiling, we seem reactionary, not proactive.
But proactive could also seem defensive.
Like the suspect that screams "I didn't do it" before anyone asks.
Aside from that, we simply haven't had time to prepare.
- Maybe wait a couple of weeks.
- That defeats the purpose.
- Then a few days.
- I'd like to go with Dunbar.
- Sir...
- I've made my decision.
Bill, I'd like you to convey my wishes to the attorney general.
Ultimately, the decision is his.
We can't appear to be pressuring him.
- Of course not.
- Thank you, sir.
The only thing more satisfying than convincing someone to do what I want, is failing to persuade them on purpose.
It's like a "Do Not Enter" sign, it just begs you to walk through the door.
Doyle's about halfway through our initial background check.
Every donor, every political event.
Everything that Dunbar might be looking into.
- Good.
Seth?
- We avoid any official statement, follow the president's cue.
In the meantime, I'd like to make some off the record calls.
You welcome the investigation, it's the right step, et cetera.
Give folks the personal touch.
That's fine, as long as we don't come off defensive.
I'd like to see a list of who you'd be calling.
Some of this is gonna be on the fly, it'd be great if I had a little leeway.
Let Seth do his thing, you'll have your hands full with Doyle.
I'll let you know who I've called.
All right, let's get to work.
Sir?
Yes, what is it?
I understand that you need to delegate, but when you contradict me in front of Seth, it compromises my authority over him.
You can't micromanage, we have too much to do.
Seth is still new to the team.
I need to make sure that he's doing his job properly.
- Well, I think he is.
- I'm your fail-safe, sir.
But I can't be that if you won't let me.
Are you, Doug?
- My failsafe?
- Do you doubt that?
We're flying full throttle into a hurricane, and you're talking office politics instead of focusing on making sure we don't get ripped apart.
You're right, sir.
I shouldn't have brought it up.
- Is she still there?
- Yeah.
I told her I was going for a walk.
Look, Doug, I know you said you wanted her gone, but you have to understand...
She can stay.
- What?
- She doesn't have to leave, she can stay.
I trust you to be smart.
Will you read to me?
- My Bible's inside.
- Doesn't have to be the Bible.
Just pull up something on your phone.
- Like what?
- A Tale of Two Cities.
My mom used to read it to me.
"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom,
it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope,
it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way."
Hello?
Doug, is that you?
Hello?
Hello?
Doug?
Yes, Doug, it is you.
Look at that, Cashew.
Someone's being a bad boy.
"Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour, and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice.
And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another."
Do you want me to keep going with this, or something else?
Doesn't matter to me.
I just like hearing you read it.
Doug, there's something I need to talk to you about.
You said that she was just staying for a few nights.
Her roommate kicked her out.
She doesn't have anywhere else to go.
- It's not our problem.
- I can't put her out on the street.
What's her name?
- Lisa.
- Lisa what?
You don't have anything to worry about.
- Where is she now?
- At the fellowship.
There's a sleepover with some of the kids from the day care.
Does she know about me?
No, I haven't told her anything.
I have given you space.
I trusted you, Rachel,
- and you've taken advantage--
- I'm not kicking her out.
- I could have said nothing, but I told you.
- I have to go.
She better be gone by the next time we talk.
- Sir.
- What took you so long?
I can have a briefing ready in five minutes.
Don't bother.
I had Seth do it.
He doesn't have security clearance.
Well, he does now.
Mr. President, after you.
I'll see you in my office.
Japanese sovereignty is a matter of precedent.
Mr. Prime Minister, my concern is escalation.
Well, I'm asking for a small portion of the 7th Fleet.
We must bring China into line.
Show them that the US and Japan maintain a strong alliance.
Have you reached out directly to Beijing?
No recognition that the island belongs to Japan.
Well, I'd like to speak to my team and formulate a plan.
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.
Admiral, for those catching up...
Two Chinese destroyers entered waters within three miles of Yonaguni Island here, approximately six hours ago.
See how close the island is to Taiwan.
This is different than the standoff over the Senkaku Islands.
It could have to do with shipping routes.
Or the trade war.
They can't pick on the big kids, so they're picking on the little one.
- Do you see that?
- What?
In the alley, camera two.
All posts, white male, hooded sweatshirt, duffel bag.
Southeast side of Fair St.
Put down the bag.
Put down the bag and place your hands on your head.
Stay right where you are.
Mrs. Underwood?
Will you come downstairs, please?
- Where's Francis?
- He got delayed at the White House, there was an emergency meeting.
- What's going on?
- I'll explain in the safe room.
The 7th Fleet is near Guam?
Ninety miles north.
We could have ships to Yonaguni in less than a week.
But even sending them in that direction will be picked up by the Chinese satellites.
Well, we have to stand with our allies, that can't be in question.
What if we don't send ships, just make a strong statement condemning their excursion into Japan's territorial waters.
We still have to offer the Chinese an incentive to call back their destroyers.
Whatever overtures we make, I'd like to have contingency plans in place.
- Already drafting them, sir.
- Cathy, open up a diplomatic channel with Beijing.
See if there's a concrete ask, if they don't have one, let's create a list of options.
- Right away, sir.
- How about coordination with the Japanese navy?
Go.
Don't engage with our navy yet.
I want to talk directly to Prime Minister Oshiro and express our intentions.
Former marine.
He showed up at the outer perimeter with explosives in a duffel bag.
- And strapped to his body.
- Jesus.
We apprehended him, the press isn't aware.
- Well, let's keep it that way.
- He claimed he was responsible for sending the package of white powder to the capitol.
So this time he really wanted to take me out for real.
Not exactly.
His wife got an abortion last week without telling him.
- Oh, my God.
It was me.
- Yes, you were the target.
We'd like to keep you down here with us, Mrs. Underwood,
- until we confirm he was acting alone.
- I'll stay.
No, you have to get back to the White House.
- I can work from here.
- Francis, I'm fine.
Honestly.
I'm just gonna be in here.
I want you to stick with her at all times.
Keep me informed of everything.
He's almost done with his shift, sir.
I can put another agent on--
- No, I want it to be Meechum.
- Absolutely, sir.
As long as necessary.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
It's OK.
Don't go to California.
Mm...
Be nice to be reelected.
You're gonna win.
Not if I don't give the voters more face time.
When did you get it?
- The Army?
- Yeah.
It's grown since then.
Tell me about it.
No.
Why not?
I don't want to.
What are you doing?
Tell me about the tattoo.
- That's not fair.
- So what?
You think you can just get me wet and I'll spill everything?
- I don't think so...
- Mm I know so.
Tell me.
I like the pain.
- Of the needle?
- Yeah.
How bad did it hurt?
It hurt a lot.
You like when it hurts?
I killed a lot of people.
What?
In the Army.
The pain it helped.
Finish.
The most I could find was some wrangling with the EPA when he opened his first plant, but that was almost 40 years ago.
- We need more.
I want Tusk gone.
- Doyle and I will keep looking.
If you haven't found anything now, what makes you think you will?
Maybe we missed something.
I doubt it, but we could try.
You think Tusk isn't planning his next attack even as we speak?
We've been thorough, sir.
He doesn't leave footprints.
You want to shift tactics?
The casino.
We go public as soon as possible.
You said that was a last resort.
Seth, you need to find a way to make that happen so it doesn't link to us.
If we launch that missile, it could blow us up too.
Not if we spin it right.
- If we keep the focus on--
- Seth.
You're here to listen, not contribute.
I wouldn't have him here if I didn't want him to contribute.
Sir... he's been sitting with this for three hours.
I've been working on it for three months.
And accomplished nothing.
It's time we go on the offensive.
- What do you think?
- Ayla Sayyad.
- She's already digging into Tusk and Feng.
- How close is she?
She never mentioned a casino, but now that I know what the dots are,
I can see that she's starting to connect them.
The Pentagon isn't talking yet.
I imagine they're waiting on the White House.
I hear there have been regular meetings in the Situation Room since last night.
Let me call you right back.
- Hello?
- Hey, Lynne, it's Ayla.
- I just sent you a picture.
- Yeah, I got it.
- What does it mean?
- It's strange, it doesn't make sense.
- Tell me.
- "Pursue currency" would be the most literal translation.
Or "pursue money."
- Follow the money?
- That could work.
Thanks, Lynne.
I like what you've done.
This sofa, it's new?
- These lamps as well?
- I've made a few changes.
You get so used to a place, the smallest things stand out.
I apologize for not being responsive sooner.
I've been focused on the midterms.
Oh, there's no need to explain.
Mrs. Underwood, you know how much I respect your intentions, but I've thought deeply about this and
I can't cosponsor the bill in its current form.
Civilian oversight is too extreme a step, but I'd be happy to revisit some of the other less extreme proposals.
You think we're being extremist?
I want to help with this issue, but this bill goes through--
This bill is through Armed Services.
This bill has a date on the floor.
Almost every woman in the House supports this bill.
- And I can't be one of them.
- So you lied to us.
I didn't lie.
I didn't lie.
I...
I want to help.
As long as we rethink some of the language.
Are you trying to distance yourself from us because of the Galloway scandal?
- No.
- Maybe you think it hurts your chances
- of reelection if you associate with me.
- That's not it.
It's because I honestly don't believe in this approach.
Do you realize the message this sends?
The only woman in congressional leadership in both parties, and you bow out?
If the bill goes to the floor as is, I won't just bow out.
I'll actively fight it.
You never asked my position.
You assumed.
I can't imagine what that position must be.
I've served in war zones, I know firsthand how important--
We're not talking about war zones.
We're talking about sexual assault.
How about a military commission to review the internal--
We don't need more studies, we need reform.
Well, let's continue this conversation when I return from California.
I'll be back the day after tomorrow if you change your mind.
I won't, but I hope you change yours.
China was insulted at the notion that we could buy them off.
Do I need to call President Qian?
I doubt he would contradict one of his ministers.
See if he's willing to talk one-on-one.
You should know, sir, Japan is also preparing to deploy three destroyers and a light cruiser.
They're upping the ante.
Have Ambassador Hines get in touch with the prime minister, and ask if Japan will hold off until I make contact with Beijing.
Yes, sir.
Have you gotten any rest at all?
- No, have you?
- No, not yet.
How's Claire?
Secret Service thinks it's an isolated attempt, but they're being cautious.
After the Galloway thing and the interview, half the country thinks she's a baby killer, or an adulterer, or both.
But Claire's taking it in stride.
We're in good hands.
That's very frightening.
I can see why you haven't slept.
One of us should, probably the one that's calling all the shots.
No, I can hold out a little while longer.
No, go to the residence, spend some time with your wife.
You'll come back feeling like a new man.
Honestly, it's less stressful here.
- Counseling hasn't helped?
- No, it has... slowly.
- I got rid of Christina when Linda resigned.
- I heard.
It's improved things some, but there's still work to do.
Makes me tired just to think about it.
Well, you probably wouldn't be the first president to get a little shut-eye on one of these sofas.
- I was joking.
- I wasn't.
Do the free world a favor and get some rest.
- I'll let you be.
- No, stick around.
You should be nearby if President Qian wants to get on the phone.
I've always loathed the necessity of sleep.
Like death, it puts the most powerful men on their backs.
DC Limo and Bus Rental.
I'm calling from the Adohi Casino's travel department.
We've got a corporate account.
Let's see...
I'm sorry, we don't have one in our records.
My mistake.
I must've called the wrong limo service.
Thank you.
Missouri Bus and Limo.
I'm calling from the Adohi Casino's travel department.
- You're not Darlene.
- No, Darlene is out sick.
I'm filling in for her.
My name is Pam.
How can I help you, Pam?
We've got a flight coming in from China tomorrow.
We'll need some transportation.
How many you got coming?
I don't have the manifest right in front of me.
- The usual?
- That's right.
- So a luxury bus.
- How many does that fit?
Fifty-five, usually about 20 come in.
Should be plenty of room.
That's great, thanks.
Do you think it's really her conscience, or because the bill's controversial?
I don't think she would have threatened to fight us if all she wanted to do was avoid controversy.
I'll talk to her.
I really want this bill to pass.
I know you do, so do I.
We need Jackie more than ever, Francis.
I'm damaged goods, this whole Adam thing.
No, you're not.
We fought past that.
Well, there's plenty of people who still believe it's true.
We'll get it passed, I promise.
- No, thanks.
- Come on.
It's no fun doing it alone.
We could just go for a run.
No more runs until the death threats die down, that's the new rule.
But they let you go to the office.
Because I was in a bulletproof car.
Does this mean we've officially not quit?
We've never been quitters, have we?
Sir, Mrs. Underwood, sorry to interrupt.
I was gonna head home, but I'll stick around if you want me to.
Oh, no.
You've been up long enough.
Get some sleep.
I'll be back first thing in the morning.
Thank you for looking after me today.
My pleasure, ma'am.
Sir, Mrs. Underwood.
- He's very dedicated.
- He is.
It's rare to find someone like Edward.
- What?
- You never use his first name.
Oh, did I?
I don't feel right talking about her like this.
It's just... technically, she's my boss now.
- There's a certain protocol.
- This is coming directly from Doug.
Which means it's coming directly from the vice president.
Well, um, I have seen Mr. Danton around from time to time.
Do you know what he and the congresswoman were discussing?
No, they were private meetings.
Do you have the appointment schedule?
I'd like to look at the dates.
These weren't formal appointments.
He just stops by.
Most of the time pretty late at night.
Did the money originate in China?
The money came from tribal revenue.
As our FEC reports clearly stated.
Let me rephrase.
Did any of that revenue come from Chinese visitors who gambled at your casino?
We have visitors from all over the world.
I'm speaking specifically about a businessman named Xander Feng.
I have no idea who that is.
I'm looking at FAA flight records that show a private plane he owns making numerous trips to Kansas City.
And I spoke with Missouri Bus and Limo, which has transported Chinese visitors to your casino.
- Ms. Said--
- Sayyad.
Ms. Sayyad, the only reason I returned your call was because you work for The Telegraph.
It's not every day that I get a call from a paper as big as yours.
But I don't know what you're trying to get at here, so if you'll excuse--
What about Raymond Tusk?
- What about him?
- Feng has ties to Tusk.
Tusk has ties to the president.
You have ties to Feng.
That looks like foreign money being used to influence political--
What you're insinuating is not only wrong,
- it's libelous.
- Not if it's true.
I won't bat an eyelash getting my attorneys involved.
Tusk made the same threat.
If a man worth 40 billion dollars doesn't intimidate me, you certainly don't, Mr. Lana--
Hello?
He hung up.
I had nothing to do with it, Raymond.
I can smell the horseshit through the phone.
You think I'd put myself at this great a risk?
Desperate men are capable of anything.
- I want it to go away, just like you do.
- Then pull her back.
I have no control over the press, Raymond.
You'll destroy yourself, Frank, not me.
Thank you for that unsolicited advice.
Work with Doyle, make sure we have no weak spots.
- I'll call him now.
- What did Nancy say?
Well, it looks like Jackie may be sleeping with the enemy.
Lanagin is correct in saying we run the risk of libel.
These links are supported by fact.
Individually, but you can't complete the circle.
I'm not saying the headline should read:
Money Laundering Scheme Exposed!
Just that we present the landscape as we currently know it.
We're first and foremost a financial paper.
Many of our readers worship Raymond Tusk.
So we just protect him?
We don't insinuate connections we can't back up.
If there's any basis for litigation, you can be sure his team will be aggressive.
They've bankrupted papers before.
I think you should slow down and take your time.
When, and if, you have a story--
Mr. Maxfield, Raymond Tusk is on the line.
- Did you put in a call to him?
- Yesterday.
He's specifically asking for you, sir.
We got off the phone with Lanagin less than 30 minutes ago.
That means Tusk was the first call Lanagin made.
Tell him I'll return.
Did you reach out to the White House?
They're not talking to anyone until after the president does his press briefing tomorrow.
All right, walk me through all of this again, point by point.
- Meechum.
- We can talk tomorrow, sir.
No.
What is it?
I'd like to put in a request to be on your wife's detail full time.
At least until the death threats quiet down.
That's very thoughtful.
I'll only do it if you approve, sir.
- Have you spoken to Claire?
- When she came home.
- She likes the idea.
- Then I think we should do it.
I'll let Agent Rockland know.
Sorry for interrupting you, sir.
You didn't interrupt anything.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Meechum.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You'll never believe what just happened.
- What?
- Meechum came into the office and found me watching something...
- ...other than the news.
- Oh!
- Oh, no.
- He was very professional about it.
- Were you...?
- No, no.
I was just watching.
That's really funny.
What about you?
What are you watching?
The video Connor gave me.
It's our first state senate race.
I forgot about that.
So did I, until I found it in the desk this morning.
Let me see.
...been there, like I have.
Of course, it doesn't hurt to have a little Texas in them...
My God, look how young we are.
I know.
Everyone here has been so kind, and so welcoming.
We'll have her rooting for Clemson before too long.
That's where I have to draw the line.
Do you miss being with Adam?
Where did that come from?
Miss it?
No.
Well, you must, sometimes.
He meant a lot to me for a while.
But that's done now.
What about you?
What about me?
Are you unsatisfied?
There's just too much at stake now.
No one we can trust.
We don't have the freedom we once did.
Maybe it's better this way.
No room for distractions.
I don't mind the sacrifice.
We chose this instead.
I think the one thing we can agree on is the ribs here are better.
See, he's just trying to get under my skin.
No, it's not even debatable...
- How was California?
- Oh...
Exhausting.
Twelve events in two days.
- Is this the Golden Gate?
- Yes.
I had an etching right there.
The capitol before it was finished.
Took 85 years to complete it.
- How long did it take to complete the bridge?
- About four years.
It opened a few months after FDR's second inaugural.
There was a man who got things done.
Strong beliefs and he stuck to them.
But compromised when he had to.
I assume you're here to talk about Claire's bill.
It's not a pet project.
There are three dozen cosponsors on either side of the aisle.
- It's a serious bill.
- I don't disagree.
- Except with the language.
- I can explain my thinking, but I doubt I'll convince you anymore--
Putting aside the military's honor, chain of command, all the things that you hold dear let's consider one simple fact.
You wouldn't have this office if it weren't for me.
I made very clear that I wouldn't be a puppet.
I'm not trying to pull strings, but you could show a little gratitude.
If it were anything else, Mr. Vice President... but not this.
All you're doing is making the inevitable more difficult.
It's not inevitable.
Claire doesn't have the votes yet.
You really want to fight us on this.
I don't want to fight you at all.
Which is why I suggested to Claire that we sit down--
I neither have the time nor the inclination to negotiate with you!
Cosponsor the bill, whip the damn votes, I'm no longer asking.
Then I'm no longer listening.
You don't have just this office to thank me for.
If you win reelection, you can thank me for that, too.
Those attack ads didn't just disappear on their own.
- What do you mean?
- Why don't you ask Remy Danton.
And ask him about Raymond Tusk while you're at it.
That ought to make for some very interesting pillow talk.
You keep up the good work, Nancy.
I will, Mr. Vice President.
I miss having you around, but you're my eyes and ears now, otherwise I'd steal you back in a heartbeat.
Well, thank you, sir.
It means a lot to me that you say that.
- Doug?
- I'm busy.
The story just broke.
They timed it with the president's press conference.
Connect me with the vice president.
So the 7th Fleet is currently positioned near Guam, where it will remain if China removes its ships from Japan's sovereign waters.
I've been in frequent touch with prime minister Oshiro, and have made personal overtures to President Qian.
And I remain optimistic that tensions will be quelled without any further escalations.
So, with that, I'll take some questions.
- Henry, you first.
- Can you comment on the Wall Street Telegraph article--
I was just notified of that moments before I joined you.
I haven't had a chance to read it yet.
Yeah, Jane.
Mr. President, would you walk us through your history with Raymond Tusk?
I'm here to answer questions on Sino-Japanese relations.
Mark.
The article mentions Xander Feng, a wealthy and influential Chinese business--
Unless this has to do with the statement I just made--
It does, Mr. President.
Feng has ties to the standing committee and we're currently in a standoff with the Chinese.
Economically--
Thank you all very much.
It's not beginning the story that I fear, it's not knowing how it will end.
Everyone is fair game now, including me.
This is par for the course, what we've come to expect from President Walker.
Whenever he's selling a shiny new car, he can't say enough about it.
The engine breaks down, the transmission gives out, he dodges, he ignores the warranty.
I'm gonna tell you something, our warranty is the Constitution of the United States, and there's no limit on that.
He needs to read the fine print and start answering our questions.
If any of this is true, we're talking Congress, the White House, both parties...
Now, I'm saying "if,"
but when it looks like dirty money, and it smells like dirty money, somebody has probably got dirt under their nails.
Look, there's no real proof this money laundering is even--
The connections are troubling, especially Underwood.
He was the House whip the entire time Adohi were contributing to the Democrats, and he's working side by side with the president now.
The president.
So this goes all the way to the White House?
- It might.
- It's hypothetical.
And by the way, you've cherry-picked the facts to make your case.
I'm not making a case.
My headline is:
PAC Money Raises Questions.
And it has.
I haven't answered those questions, but I think the American people deserve answers.
Don't you?
You can bet your bottom dollar the attorney general is gonna investigate.
- With the firestorm this is causing in the media--
- What's our course of action?
As your counsel, I would encourage you not to speak to the press until we have more information.
As your average citizen, the longer you wait, the more suspicious it looks.
If there's been any irregularity, I had nothing to do with it.
Your friendship with Tusk implies guilt by association.
Are we presuming guilt before innocence?
I'm a lawyer, I presume nothing.
But public opinion doesn't have a law degree.
Give us a few moments.
I have to advise you not to have any conversation about this matter
- without me present.
- Your advisement has been noted.
I'll be right outside.
Is this what you were keeping from me?
We should follow your counsel's advice
- and not--
- Tell me if it's true, about the money.
With Bill out of the room, we open ourselves up to--
Damn it, Frank!
I've been in the dark too long on this.
That ends now.
I don't know any details.
Feng told me if the Bridge project got approved, the GOP would stop getting money.
We approved it, the money stopped.
Jesus Christ, that connects the White House directly to the money.
No, sir.
You knew nothing, you still know nothing.
If the DOJ finds any concrete evidence of foreign money--
That's Raymond Tusk's head, not yours.
You've done nothing wrong.
Guilt by association, Frank.
You heard the man.
If the DOJ investigates, it will only prove your innocence.
Nobody walks away from something like this without bruises.
Well, bruises you can survive.
I just don't know how we can avoid it at this point.
Unless you want to accelerate the process and get rid of it.
We could always have the attorney general appoint a special prosecutor.
- That's a terrible idea.
- Maybe so.
And given where we are, Frank, I'm not inclined to follow your suggestions.
Well, I wasn't suggesting it was something you should do.
Just as a possibility.
No, in fact, I don't think you should.
I think it's better to drag these things out as long as possible.
- Let the public fatigue on it.
- And have it hanging over our heads until the midterms?
- It'll lose steam.
- What if it doesn't.
I've got the Pentagon proposing tactical drone strikes in the South China Sea.
I can't be dealing with something like this for months on end.
Maybe you're right then.
A special prosecutor is the way to go.
I didn't say that, you did.
Oh, no.
I just meant in terms of getting it off your plate.
It wouldn't be on my plate if you kept me better informed.
I have done nothing but try to insulate you, sir.
Is that what you call the feeding frenzy I just went through?
I make this solemn promise to you, Mr. President.
I will take the fall if it comes to that, but it won't.
However you decide to deal with this, I think your instincts are right.
We probably shouldn't involve a special prosecutor.
Send Bill back in.
You knew about this.
Tusk is a client, doesn't mean I know everything--
Bullshit.
The reason you're a partner at Glendon Hill is because you know the things nobody else does.
What do you want me to say?
- Is it true?
- We don't talk about work.
We're not in bed, we're in my fucking office.
And in here, you work for Frank.
- I work for no one but myself.
- Keep telling yourself that.
Unlike you, I don't peddle my goods for whoever can pay the highest retainer.
I'm the bitch to a lot of top dogs, I'm fully aware and willing, but you're worse.
You're Frank's bitch and refuse to believe it.
- That's not true.
- Case in fucking point.
Don't turn this.
You knew about the money and you didn't tell me.
Even though it's thrown my seat into contention.
Let's say there was money, and let's say I did know,
- what good would it have done?
- It means you were willing to watch me lose!
It means I respected the boundaries that you demanded.
- No changes, no special treatment.
- This is different!
- So now we're making exceptions?
- When it's this important, yes!
You can't have it both ways.
Were you...?
Was I what?
...fucking me to get info on Frank?
- Is that what you think?
- I don't know what to think.
I care about you more than I should.
But I'm getting tired of having to say it.
He's being moved to a federal psychiatric facility for assessment.
Then a high security detention center until the official sentencing.
Well, that's good to hear.
The bad news is we don't want you doing any public events for a while.
My bill's about to go to the floor.
I need to have a public profile.
Your death threats continue to rise.
We can't take the risk.
- Am I even allowed to leave the house?
- Of course.
But we want you to avoid large crowds.
Our ability to protect-- Mr. Vice President.
- Anything wrong?
- We were just briefing Mrs. Underwood on her new security protocol.
- Can we actually finish this later?
- Of course.
How did it go?
- He's skeptical.
- Should I call Tricia?
No.
It could look like I was trying to go behind his back.
We'll just have to wait and see.
I made my case.
Hopefully, he'll disagree with it.
But this could've been the wrong move.
Well, don't doubt yourself.
Seth has gotten over 3,000 e-mails in the last six hours.
- The phones are overloaded.
- So you ignore all that?
I can't ignore the Department of Justice.
What can I do?
Come and visit me when I'm in prison.
You don't have to stand by that door.
Take a load off.
Thank you, sir, but I'm supposed to stay on my feet.
Well, I won't tell if you won't.
And if anybody gives you any trouble about this, or anything, they can talk to me.
- Beautiful night.
- Yes, sir.
It's been strange not having you around these last few days.
You want me to switch back to your detail?
No, no.
I'm glad you're with Claire.
I just didn't realize how much I got used to your company until you were gone.
Protecting her is the same as protecting you, in my mind.
Oh, come on.
- Why do you do this?
- Do what, sir?
I've always been awestruck, people who are willing to take a bullet for someone else.
- That's how I serve my country.
- Well, there's a lot of ways to serve your country.
And this is my way.
- I haven't finished with this one yet.
- It's not for you.
I can't drink on duty, ma'am.
It's not for you either.
Well, come on over and join the party.
Haven't you got sick of seeing my face yet?
Never, ma'am.
To Meechum, for his loyalty and service.
To Edward.
I'm on my way to my lawyer's office, Remy.
That's not where I want to be when I'd usually be in bed.
I can't stop Frank from leaking things.
No, but you can make sure he suffers more than us.
And I say "us," Remy, because your skin is in this game now, too.
- Are you gonna deny?
- Of course I'm gonna deny.
Every step of this was legal.
They can't prove the links between them.
- What about Lanagin?
- He'll cooperate.
It's Feng we need to worry about.
I'll find a way to get in touch with him.
We do have one major advantage.
The public can hate me, but as long as Clayton West remains profitable, my stockholders won't care.
Frank doesn't have the same liberty.
Public opinion can demolish him.
You need to make sure that happens.
I can work with the Republicans on that.
Well, we'll be under the magnifying glass too.
This will be a witch hunt.
I'll make sure that they pick the right targets.
What you need to do is go after the leadership.
Make them hurt.
They'll turn on Frank to save themselves.
Birch, Womack, Sharp.
Especially Jackie Sharp.
She's his chosen one.
- Remy?
- I heard you.
I got my marching orders.
- I'm counting on you.
- I'll deliver.
Let's talk in the morning.
The two names I like the most are Justin Gaines and Heather Dunbar.
Gaines has better credentials.
But he's close to the administration.
I would've made him a federal judge if the GOP hadn't blocked it.
That's an important point.
Dunbar's got grit.
- She's more than qualified.
- No baggage there?
- She's more unpredictable.
- I doubt the attorney general would've put her on his list if he thought she was a wild card.
Sir, I have to say, I think this step is premature.
We should hold off and see what the DOJ does on its own.
I don't want to do it, Bill, but my fear is this:
if we wait until the water goes from hot to boiling, we seem reactionary, not proactive.
But proactive could also seem defensive.
Like the suspect that screams "I didn't do it" before anyone asks.
Aside from that, we simply haven't had time to prepare.
- Maybe wait a couple of weeks.
- That defeats the purpose.
- Then a few days.
- I'd like to go with Dunbar.
- Sir--
- I've made my decision.
Bill, I'd like you to convey my wishes to the attorney general.
Ultimately, the decision is his.
We can't appear to be pressuring him.
- Of course not.
- Thank you, sir.
The only thing more satisfying than convincing someone to do what I want, is failing to persuade them on purpose.
It's like a "Do Not Enter" sign, it just begs you to walk through the door.
Doyle's about halfway through our initial background check.
Every donor, every political event.
Everything that Dunbar might be looking into.
- Good.
Seth?
- We avoid any official statement, follow the president's cue.
In the meantime, I'd like to make some off the record calls.
You welcome the investigation, it's the right step, et cetera.
Give folks the personal touch.
That's fine, as long as we don't come off defensive.
I'd like to see a list of who you'd be calling.
Some of this is gonna be on the fly, it'd be great if I had a little leeway.
Let Seth do his thing, you'll have your hands full with Doyle.
I'll let you know who I've called.
All right, let's get to work.
Sir?
Yes, what is it?
I understand that you need to delegate, but when you contradict me in front of Seth, it compromises my authority over him.
You can't micromanage, we have too much to do.
Seth is still new to the team.
I need to make sure that he's doing his job properly.
- Well, I think he is.
- I'm your fail-safe, sir.
But I can't be that if you won't let me.
Are you, Doug?
- My failsafe?
- Do you doubt that?
We're flying full throttle into a hurricane, and you're talking office politics instead of focusing on making sure we don't get ripped apart.
You're right, sir.
I shouldn't have brought it up.
- Is she still there?
- Yeah.
I told her I was going for a walk.
Look, Doug, I know you said you wanted her gone, but you have to understand--
She can stay.
- What?
- She doesn't have to leave, she can stay.
I trust you to be smart.
Will you read to me?
- My Bible's inside.
- Doesn't have to be the Bible.
Just pull up something on your phone.
- Like what?
- A Tale of Two Cities.
My mom used to read it to me.
"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom,
it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope,
it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way."
Hello?
Doug, is that you?
Hello?
Hello?
Doug?
Yes, Doug, it is you.
Previously on House of Cards...
The road to power is paved with hypocrisy and casualties.
Never regret.
- Somebody's tryin' to take you out?
- Appears that way.
Whoever it is, they done stepped on the wrong motherfuckin' rattlesnake.
You help me repair my relationship with Garrett,
Dan and I here get the money flowing back in the right direction.
How about this?
I get the BIA to investigate both of you.
You implicate us, you implicate yourself.
He sent them this.
Is that you?
You and I are just pawns, Mr. Galloway.
- How about I tell the press...
- Adam, shut up!
We're giving you an out, Adam.
And if you choose not to take it, I will bury you.
My gut says there's more to Xander Feng than has been reported.
It's a far better use of my time than reporting on tabloid sex scandals.
- You scared of this?
- Darnell!
Hit 'em again, and hit 'em now.
We have to strike back hard and fast.
More than that.
Let's make him suffer.
Look at that, Cashew.
Someone's being a bad boy.
"Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour, and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice.
And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another."
Do you want me to keep going with this, or something else?
Doesn't matter to me.
I just like hearing you read it.
Doug, there's something I need to talk to you about.
You said that she was just staying for a few nights.
Her roommate kicked her out.
She doesn't have anywhere else to go.
- It's not our problem.
- I can't put her out on the street.
What's her name?
- Lisa.
- Lisa what?
You don't have anything to worry about.
- Where is she now?
- At the fellowship.
There's a sleepover with some of the kids from the day care.
Does she know about me?
No, I haven't told her anything.
I have given you space.
I trusted you, Rachel,
- and you've taken advantage...
- I'm not kicking her out.
- I could have said nothing, but I told you.
- I have to go.
She better be gone by the next time we talk.
- Sir.
- What took you so long?
I can have a briefing ready in five minutes.
Don't bother.
I had Seth do it.
He doesn't have security clearance.
Well, he does now.
Mr. President, after you.
I'll see you in my office.
Japanese sovereignty is a matter of precedent.
Mr. Prime Minister, my concern is escalation.
Well, I'm asking for a small portion of the 7th Fleet.
We must bring China into line.
Show them that the US and Japan maintain a strong alliance.
Have you reached out directly to Beijing?
No recognition that the island belongs to Japan.
Well, I'd like to speak to my team and formulate a plan.
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.
Admiral, for those catching up...
Two Chinese destroyers entered waters within three miles of Yonaguni Island here, approximately six hours ago.
See how close the island is to Taiwan.
This is different than the standoff over the Senkaku Islands.
It could have to do with shipping routes.
Or the trade war.
They can't pick on the big kids, so they're picking on the little one.
- Do you see that?
- What?
In the alley, camera two.
All posts, white male, hooded sweatshirt, duffel bag.
Southeast side of Fair St.
Put down the bag.
Put down the bag and place your hands on your head.
Stay right where you are.
Mrs. Underwood?
Will you come downstairs, please?
- Where's Francis?
- He got delayed at the White House, there was an emergency meeting.
- What's going on?
- I'll explain in the safe room.
The 7th Fleet is near Guam?
Ninety miles north.
We could have ships to Yonaguni in less than a week.
But even sending them in that direction will be picked up by the Chinese satellites.
Well, we have to stand with our allies, that can't be in question.
What if we don't send ships, just make a strong statement condemning their excursion into Japan's territorial waters.
We still have to offer the Chinese an incentive to call back their destroyers.
Whatever overtures we make, I'd like to have contingency plans in place.
- Already drafting them, sir.
- Cathy, open up a diplomatic channel with Beijing.
See if there's a concrete ask, if they don't have one, let's create a list of options.
- Right away, sir.
- How about coordination with the Japanese navy?
Go.
Don't engage with our navy yet.
I want to talk directly to Prime Minister Oshiro and express our intentions.
Former marine.
He showed up at the outer perimeter with explosives in a duffel bag.
- And strapped to his body.
- Jesus.
We apprehended him, the press isn't aware.
- Well, let's keep it that way.
- He claimed he was responsible for sending the package of white powder to the capitol.
So this time he really wanted to take me out for real.
Not exactly.
His wife got an abortion last week without telling him.
- Oh, my God.
It was me.
- Yes, you were the target.
We'd like to keep you down here with us, Mrs. Underwood,
- until we confirm he was acting alone.
- I'll stay.
No, you have to get back to the White House.
- I can work from here.
- Francis, I'm fine.
Honestly.
I'm just gonna be in here.
I want you to stick with her at all times.
Keep me informed of everything.
He's almost done with his shift, sir.
I can put another agent on...
- No, I want it to be Meechum.
- Absolutely, sir.
As long as necessary.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
It's OK.
Don't go to California.
Mm...
Be nice to be reelected.
You're gonna win.
Not if I don't give the voters more face time.
When did you get it?
- The Army?
- Yeah.
It's grown since then.
Tell me about it.
No.
Why not?
I don't want to.
What are you doing?
Tell me about the tattoo.
- That's not fair.
- So what?
You think you can just get me wet and I'll spill everything?
- I don't think so...
- Mm I know so.
Tell me.
I like the pain.
- Of the needle?
- Yeah.
How bad did it hurt?
It hurt a lot.
You like when it hurts?
I killed a lot of people.
What?
In the Army.
The pain it helped.
Finish.
The most I could find was some wrangling with the EPA when he opened his first plant, but that was almost 40 years ago.
- We need more.
I want Tusk gone.
- Doyle and I will keep looking.
If you haven't found anything now, what makes you think you will?
Maybe we missed something.
I doubt it, but we could try.
You think Tusk isn't planning his next attack even as we speak?
We've been thorough, sir.
He doesn't leave footprints.
You want to shift tactics?
The casino.
We go public as soon as possible.
You said that was a last resort.
Seth, you need to find a way to make that happen so it doesn't link to us.
If we launch that missile, it could blow us up too.
Not if we spin it right.
- If we keep the focus on...
- Seth.
You're here to listen, not contribute.
I wouldn't have him here if I didn't want him to contribute.
Sir... he's been sitting with this for three hours.
I've been working on it for three months.
And accomplished nothing.
It's time we go on the offensive.
- What do you think?
- Ayla Sayyad.
- She's already digging into Tusk and Feng.
- How close is she?
She never mentioned a casino, but now that I know what the dots are,
I can see that she's starting to connect them.
The Pentagon isn't talking yet.
I imagine they're waiting on the White House.
I hear there have been regular meetings in the Situation Room since last night.
Let me call you right back.
- Hello?
- Hey, Lynne, it's Ayla.
- I just sent you a picture.
- Yeah, I got it.
- What does it mean?
- It's strange, it doesn't make sense.
- Tell me. - "Pursue currency" would be the most literal translation.
Or "pursue money."
- Follow the money?
- That could work.
Thanks, Lynne.
I like what you've done.
This sofa, it's new?
- These lamps as well?
- I've made a few changes.
You get so used to a place, the smallest things stand out.
I apologize for not being responsive sooner.
I've been focused on the midterms.
Oh, there's no need to explain.
Mrs. Underwood, you know how much I respect your intentions, but I've thought deeply about this and
I can't cosponsor the bill in its current form.
Civilian oversight is too extreme a step, but I'd be happy to revisit some of the other less extreme proposals.
You think we're being extremist?
I want to help with this issue, but this bill goes through...
This bill is through Armed Services.
This bill has a date on the floor.
Almost every woman in the House supports this bill.
- And I can't be one of them.
- So you lied to us.
I didn't lie.
I didn't lie.
I...
I want to help.
As long as we rethink some of the language.
Are you trying to distance yourself from us because of the Galloway scandal?
- No.
- Maybe you think it hurts your chances
- of reelection if you associate with me.
- That's not it.
It's because I honestly don't believe in this approach.
Do you realize the message this sends?
The only woman in congressional leadership in both parties, and you bow out?
If the bill goes to the floor as is, I won't just bow out.
I'll actively fight it.
You never asked my position.
You assumed.
I can't imagine what that position must be.
I've served in war zones, I know firsthand how important...
We're not talking about war zones.
We're talking about sexual assault.
How about a military commission to review the internal...
We don't need more studies, we need reform.
Well, let's continue this conversation when I return from California.
I'll be back the day after tomorrow if you change your mind.
I won't, but I hope you change yours.
China was insulted at the notion that we could buy them off.
Do I need to call President Qian?
I doubt he would contradict one of his ministers.
See if he's willing to talk one-on-one.
You should know, sir, Japan is also preparing to deploy three destroyers and a light cruiser.
They're upping the ante.
Have Ambassador Hines get in touch with the prime minister, and ask if Japan will hold off until I make contact with Beijing.
Yes, sir.
Have you gotten any rest at all?
- No, have you?
- No, not yet.
How's Claire?
Secret Service thinks it's an isolated attempt, but they're being cautious.
After the Galloway thing and the interview, half the country thinks she's a baby killer, or an adulterer, or both.
But Claire's taking it in stride.
We're in good hands.
That's very frightening.
I can see why you haven't slept.
One of us should, probably the one that's calling all the shots.
No, I can hold out a little while longer.
No, go to the residence, spend some time with your wife.
You'll come back feeling like a new man.
Honestly, it's less stressful here.
- Counseling hasn't helped?
- No, it has... slowly.
- I got rid of Christina when Linda resigned.
- I heard.
It's improved things some, but there's still work to do.
Makes me tired just to think about it.
Well, you probably wouldn't be the first president to get a little shut-eye on one of these sofas.
- I was joking.
- I wasn't.
Do the free world a favor and get some rest.
- I'll let you be.
- No, stick around.
You should be nearby if President Qian wants to get on the phone.
I've always loathed the necessity of sleep.
Like death, it puts the most powerful men on their backs.
DC Limo and Bus Rental.
I'm calling from the Adohi Casino's travel department.
We've got a corporate account.
Let's see...
I'm sorry, we don't have one in our records.
My mistake.
I must've called the wrong limo service.
Thank you.
Missouri Bus and Limo.
I'm calling from the Adohi Casino's travel department.
- You're not Darlene.
- No, Darlene is out sick.
I'm filling in for her.
My name is Pam.
How can I help you, Pam?
We've got a flight coming in from China tomorrow.
We'll need some transportation.
How many you got coming?
I don't have the manifest right in front of me.
- The usual?
- That's right.
- So a luxury bus.
- How many does that fit?
Fifty-five, usually about 20 come in.
Should be plenty of room.
That's great, thanks.
Do you think it's really her conscience, or because the bill's controversial?
I don't think she would have threatened to fight us if all she wanted to do was avoid controversy.
I'll talk to her.
I really want this bill to pass.
I know you do, so do I.
We need Jackie more than ever, Francis.
I'm damaged goods, this whole Adam thing.
No, you're not.
We fought past that.
Well, there's plenty of people who still believe it's true.
We'll get it passed, I promise.
- No, thanks.
- Come on.
It's no fun doing it alone.
We could just go for a run.
No more runs until the death threats die down, that's the new rule.
But they let you go to the office.
Because I was in a bulletproof car.
Does this mean we've officially not quit?
We've never been quitters, have we?
Sir, Mrs. Underwood, sorry to interrupt.
I was gonna head home, but I'll stick around if you want me to.
Oh, no.
You've been up long enough.
Get some sleep.
I'll be back first thing in the morning.
Thank you for looking after me today.
My pleasure, ma'am.
Sir, Mrs. Underwood.
- He's very dedicated.
- He is.
It's rare to find someone like Edward.
- What?
- You never use his first name.
Oh, did I?
I don't feel right talking about her like this.
It's just... technically, she's my boss now.
- There's a certain protocol.
- This is coming directly from Doug.
Which means it's coming directly from the vice president.
Well, um, I have seen Mr. Danton around from time to time.
Do you know what he and the congresswoman were discussing?
No, they were private meetings.
Do you have the appointment schedule?
I'd like to look at the dates.
These weren't formal appointments.
He just stops by.
Most of the time pretty late at night.
Did the money originate in China?
The money came from tribal revenue.
As our FEC reports clearly stated.
Let me rephrase.
Did any of that revenue come from Chinese visitors who gambled at your casino?
We have visitors from all over the world.
I'm speaking specifically about a businessman named Xander Feng.
I have no idea who that is.
I'm looking at FAA flight records that show a private plane he owns making numerous trips to Kansas City.
And I spoke with Missouri Bus and Limo, which has transported Chinese visitors to your casino.
- Ms. Said...
- Sayyad.
Ms. Sayyad, the only reason I returned your call was because you work for The Telegraph.
It's not every day that I get a call from a paper as big as yours.
But I don't know what you're trying to get at here, so if you'll excuse...
What about Raymond Tusk?
- What about him?
- Feng has ties to Tusk.
Tusk has ties to the president.
You have ties to Feng.
That looks like foreign money being used to influence political...
What you're insinuating is not only wrong,
- it's libelous.
- Not if it's true.
I won't bat an eyelash getting my attorneys involved.
Tusk made the same threat.
If a man worth 40 billion dollars doesn't intimidate me, you certainly don't, Mr. Lana...
Hello?
He hung up.
I had nothing to do with it, Raymond.
I can smell the horseshit through the phone.
You think I'd put myself at this great a risk?
Desperate men are capable of anything.
- I want it to go away, just like you do.
- Then pull her back.
I have no control over the press, Raymond.
You'll destroy yourself, Frank, not me.
Thank you for that unsolicited advice.
Work with Doyle, make sure we have no weak spots.
- I'll call him now.
- What did Nancy say?
Well, it looks like Jackie may be sleeping with the enemy.
Lanagin is correct in saying we run the risk of libel.
These links are supported by fact.
Individually, but you can't complete the circle.
I'm not saying the headline should read:
Money Laundering Scheme Exposed!
Just that we present the landscape as we currently know it.
We're first and foremost a financial paper.
Many of our readers worship Raymond Tusk.
So we just protect him?
We don't insinuate connections we can't back up.
If there's any basis for litigation, you can be sure his team will be aggressive.
They've bankrupted papers before.
I think you should slow down and take your time.
When, and if, you have a story...
Mr. Maxfield, Raymond Tusk is on the line.
- Did you put in a call to him?
- Yesterday.
He's specifically asking for you, sir.
We got off the phone with Lanagin less than 30 minutes ago.
That means Tusk was the first call Lanagin made.
Tell him I'll return.
Did you reach out to the White House?
They're not talking to anyone until after the president does his press briefing tomorrow.
All right, walk me through all of this again, point by point.
- Meechum.
- We can talk tomorrow, sir.
No.
What is it?
I'd like to put in a request to be on your wife's detail full time.
At least until the death threats quiet down.
That's very thoughtful.
I'll only do it if you approve, sir.
- Have you spoken to Claire?
- When she came home.
- She likes the idea.
- Then I think we should do it.
I'll let Agent Rockland know.
Sorry for interrupting you, sir.
You didn't interrupt anything.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Meechum.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You'll never believe what just happened.
- What?
- Meechum came into the office and found me watching something...
- ...other than the news.
- Oh!
- Oh, no.
- He was very professional about it.
- Were you...?
- No, no.
I was just watching.
That's really funny.
What about you?
What are you watching?
The video Connor gave me.
It's our first state senate race.
I forgot about that.
So did I, until I found it in the desk this morning.
Let me see.
...been there, like I have.
Of course, it doesn't hurt to have a little Texas in them...
My God, look how young we are.
I know.
Everyone here has been so kind, and so welcoming.
We'll have her rooting for Clemson before too long.
That's where I have to draw the line.
Do you miss being with Adam?
Where did that come from?
Miss it?
No.
Well, you must, sometimes.
He meant a lot to me for a while.
But that's done now.
What about you?
What about me?
Are you unsatisfied?
There's just too much at stake now.
No one we can trust.
We don't have the freedom we once did.
Maybe it's better this way.
No room for distractions.
I don't mind the sacrifice.
We chose this instead.
I think the one thing we can agree on is the ribs here are better.
See, he's just trying to get under my skin.
No, it's not even debatable...
- How was California?
- Oh...
Exhausting.
Twelve events in two days.
- Is this the Golden Gate?
- Yes.
I had an etching right there.
The capitol before it was finished.
Took 85 years to complete it.
- How long did it take to complete the bridge?
- About four years.
It opened a few months after FDR's second inaugural.
There was a man who got things done.
Strong beliefs and he stuck to them.
But compromised when he had to.
I assume you're here to talk about Claire's bill.
It's not a pet project.
There are three dozen cosponsors on either side of the aisle.
- It's a serious bill.
- I don't disagree.
- Except with the language.
- I can explain my thinking, but I doubt I'll convince you anymore...
Putting aside the military's honor, chain of command, all the things that you hold dear let's consider one simple fact.
You wouldn't have this office if it weren't for me.
I made very clear that I wouldn't be a puppet.
I'm not trying to pull strings, but you could show a little gratitude.
If it were anything else, Mr. Vice President... but not this.
All you're doing is making the inevitable more difficult.
It's not inevitable.
Claire doesn't have the votes yet.
You really want to fight us on this.
I don't want to fight you at all.
Which is why I suggested to Claire that we sit down...
I neither have the time nor the inclination to negotiate with you!
Cosponsor the bill, whip the damn votes, I'm no longer asking.
Then I'm no longer listening.
You don't have just this office to thank me for.
If you win reelection, you can thank me for that, too.
Those attack ads didn't just disappear on their own.
- What do you mean?
- Why don't you ask Remy Danton.
And ask him about Raymond Tusk while you're at it.
That ought to make for some very interesting pillow talk.
You keep up the good work, Nancy.
I will, Mr. Vice President.
I miss having you around, but you're my eyes and ears now, otherwise I'd steal you back in a heartbeat.
Well, thank you, sir.
It means a lot to me that you say that.
- Doug?
- I'm busy.
The story just broke.
They timed it with the president's press conference.
Connect me with the vice president.
So the 7th Fleet is currently positioned near Guam, where it will remain if China removes its ships from Japan's sovereign waters.
I've been in frequent touch with prime minister Oshiro, and have made personal overtures to President Qian.
And I remain optimistic that tensions will be quelled without any further escalations.
So, with that, I'll take some questions.
- Henry, you first.
- Can you comment on the Wall Street Telegraph article...
I was just notified of that moments before I joined you.
I haven't had a chance to read it yet.
Yeah, Jane.
Mr. President, would you walk us through your history with Raymond Tusk?
I'm here to answer questions on Sino-Japanese relations.
Mark.
The article mentions Xander Feng, a wealthy and influential Chinese business...
Unless this has to do with the statement I just made...
It does, Mr. President.
Feng has ties to the standing committee and we're currently in a standoff with the Chinese.
Economically...
Thank you all very much.
It's not beginning the story that I fear, it's not knowing how it will end.
Everyone is fair game now, including me.
This is par for the course, what we've come to expect from President Walker.
Whenever he's selling a shiny new car, he can't say enough about it.
The engine breaks down, the transmission gives out, he dodges, he ignores the warranty.
I'm gonna tell you something, our warranty is the Constitution of the United States, and there's no limit on that.
He needs to read the fine print and start answering our questions.
If any of this is true, we're talking Congress, the White House, both parties...
Now, I'm saying "if,"
but when it look like dirty money, and it smells like dirty money, somebody has probably got dirt under their nails.
Look, there's no real proof this money laundering is even...
The connections are troubling, especially Underwood.
He was the House whip the entire time Adohi were contributing to the Democrats, and he's working side by side with the president now.
The president.
So this goes all the way to the White House?
- It might.
- It's hypothetical.
And by the way, you've cherry-picked the facts to make your case.
I'm not making a case.
PAC Money Raises Questions.
And it has.
I haven't answered those questions, but I think the American people deserve answers.
Don't you?
You can bet your bottom dollar the attorney general is gonna investigate.
- With the firestorm this is causing in the media...
- What's our course of action?
As your counsel, I would encourage you not to speak to the press until we have more information.
As your average citizen, the longer you wait, the more suspicious it looks.
If there's been any irregularity, I had nothing to do with it.
Your friendship with Tusk implies guilt by association.
Are we presuming guilt before innocence?
I'm a lawyer, I presume nothing.
But public opinion doesn't have a law degree.
Give us a few moments.
I have to advise you not to have any conversation about this matter
- without me present.
- Your advisement has been noted.
I'll be right outside.
Is this what you were keeping from me?
We should follow your counsel's advice
- and not...
- Tell me if it's true, about the money.
With Bill out of the room, we open ourselves up to...
Damn it, Frank!
I've been in the dark too long on this.
That ends now.
I don't know any details.
Feng told me if the Bridge project got approved, the GOP would stop getting money.
We approved it, the money stopped.
Jesus Christ, that connects the White House directly to the money.
No, sir.
You knew nothing, you still know nothing.
If the DOJ finds any concrete evidence of foreign money...
That's Raymond Tusk's head, not yours.
You've done nothing wrong.
Guilt by association, Frank.
You heard the man.
If the DOJ investigates, it will only prove your innocence.
Nobody walks away from something like this without bruises.
Well, bruises you can survive.
I just don't know how we can avoid it at this point.
Unless you want to accelerate the process and get rid of it.
We could always have the attorney general appoint a special prosecutor.
- That's a terrible idea.
- Maybe so.
And given where we are, Frank, I'm not inclined to follow your suggestions.
Well, I wasn't suggesting it was something you should do.
Just as a possibility.
No, in fact, I don't think you should.
I think it's better to drag these things out as long as possible.
- Let the public fatigue on it.
- And have it hanging over our heads until the midterms?
- It'll lose steam.
- What if it doesn't.
I've got the Pentagon proposing tactical drone strikes in the South China Sea.
I can't be dealing with something like this for months on end.
Maybe you're right then.
A special prosecutor is the way to go.
I didn't say that, you did.
Oh, no.
I just meant in terms of getting it off your plate.
It wouldn't be on my plate if you kept me better informed.
I have done nothing but try to insulate you, sir.
Is that what you call the feeding frenzy I just went through?
I make this solemn promise to you, Mr. President.
I will take the fall if it comes to that, but it won't.
However you decide to deal with this, I think your instincts are right.
We probably shouldn't involve a special prosecutor.
Send Bill back in.
You knew about this.
Tusk is a client, doesn't mean I know everything...
Bullshit.
The reason you're a partner at Glendon Hill is because you know the things nobody else does.
What do you want me to say?
- Is it true?
- We don't talk about work.
We're not in bed, we're in my fucking office.
And in here, you work for Frank.
- I work for no one but myself.
- Keep telling yourself that.
Unlike you, I don't peddle my goods for whoever can pay the highest retainer.
I'm the bitch to a lot of top dogs, I'm fully aware and willing, but you're worse.
You're Frank's bitch and refuse to believe it.
- That's not true.
- Case in fucking point.
Don't turn this.
You knew about the money and you didn't tell me.
Even though it's thrown my seat into contention.
Let's say there was money, and let's say I did know,
- what good would it have done?
- It means you were willing to watch me lose!
It means I respected the boundaries that you demanded.
- No changes, no special treatment.
- This is different!
- So now we're making exceptions?
- When it's this important, yes!
You can't have it both ways.
Were you...?
Was I what?
...fucking me to get info on Frank?
- Is that what you think?
- I don't know what to think.
I care about you more than I should.
But I'm getting tired of having to say it.
He's being moved to a federal psychiatric facility for assessment.
Then a high security detention center until the official sentencing.
Well, that's good to hear.
The bad news is we don't want you doing any public events for a while.
My bill's about to go to the floor.
I need to have a public profile.
Your death threats continue to rise.
We can't take the risk.
- Am I even allowed to leave the house?
- Of course.
But we want you to avoid large crowds.
Our ability to protect...
Mr. Vice President.
- Anything wrong?
- We were just briefing Mrs. Underwood on her new security protocol.
- Can we actually finish this later?
- Of course.
How did it go?
- He's skeptical.
- Should I call Tricia?
No.
It could look like I was trying to go behind his back.
We'll just have to wait and see.
I made my case.
Hopefully, he'll disagree with it.
But this could've been the wrong move.
Well, don't doubt yourself.
Seth has gotten over 3,000 e-mails in the last six hours.
- The phones are overloaded.
- So you ignore all that?
I can't ignore the Department of Justice.
What can I do?
Come and visit me when I'm in prison.
You don't have to stand by that door.
Take a load off.
Thank you, sir, but I'm supposed to stay on my feet.
Well, I won't tell if you won't.
And if anybody gives you any trouble about this, or anything, they can talk to me.
- Beautiful night.
- Yes, sir.
It's been strange not having you around these last few days.
You want me to switch back to your detail?
No, no.
I'm glad you're with Claire.
I just didn't realize how much I got used to your company until you were gone.
Protecting her is the same as protecting you, in my mind.
Oh, come on.
- Why do you do this?
- Do what, sir?
I've always been awestruck, people who are willing to take a bullet for someone else.
- That's how I serve my country.
- Well, there's a lot of ways to serve your country.
And this is my way.
- I haven't finished with this one yet.
- It's not for you.
I can't drink on duty, ma'am.
It's not for you either.
Well, come on over and join the party.
Haven't you got sick of seeing my face yet?
Never, ma'am.
To Meechum, for his loyalty and service.
To Edward.
I'm on my way to my lawyer's office, Remy.
That's not where I want to be when I'd usually be in bed.
I can't stop Frank from leaking things.
No, but you can make sure he suffers more than us.
And I say "us," Remy, because your skin is in this game now, too.
- Are you gonna deny?
- Of course I'm gonna deny.
Every step of this was legal.
They can't prove the links between them.
- What about Lanagin?
- He'll cooperate.
It's Feng we need to worry about.
I'll find a way to get in touch with him.
We do have one major advantage.
The public can hate me, but as long as Clayton West remains profitable, my stockholders won't care.
Frank doesn't have the same liberty.
Public opinion can demolish him.
You need to make sure that happens.
I can work with the Republicans on that.
Well, we'll be under the magnifying glass too.
This will be a witch hunt.
I'll make sure that they pick the right targets.
What you need to do is go after the leadership.
Make them hurt.
They'll turn on Frank to save themselves.
Birch, Womack, Sharp.
Especially Jackie Sharp.
She's his chosen one.
- Remy?
- I heard you.
I got my marching orders.
- I'm counting on you.
- I'll deliver.
Let's talk in the morning.
The two names I like the most are Justin Gaines and Heather Dunbar.
Gaines has better credentials.
But he's close to the administration.
I would've made him a federal judge if the GOP hadn't blocked it.
That's an important point.
Dunbar's got grit.
- She's more than qualified.
- No baggage there?
- She's more unpredictable.
- I doubt the attorney general would've put her on his list if he thought she was a wild card.
Sir, I have to say, I think this step is premature.
We should hold off and see what the DOJ does on its own.
I don't want to do it, Bill, but my fear is this:
if we wait until the water goes from hot to boiling, we seem reactionary, not proactive.
But proactive could also seem defensive.
Like the suspect that screams "I didn't do it" before anyone asks.
Aside from that, we simply haven't had time to prepare.
- Maybe wait a couple of weeks.
- That defeats the purpose.
- Then a few days.
- I'd like to go with Dunbar.
- Sir...
- I've made my decision.
Bill, I'd like you to convey my wishes to the attorney general.
Ultimately, the decision is his.
We can't appear to be pressuring him.
- Of course not.
- Thank you, sir.
The only thing more satisfying than convincing someone to do what I want, is failing to persuade them on purpose.
It's like a "Do Not Enter" sign, it just begs you to walk through the door.
Doyle's about halfway through our initial background check.
Every donor, every political event.
Everything that Dunbar might be looking into.
- Good.
Seth?
- We avoid any official statement, follow the president's cue.
In the meantime, I'd like to make some off the record calls.
You welcome the investigation, it's the right step, et cetera.
Give folks the personal touch.
That's fine, as long as we don't come off defensive.
I'd like to see a list of who you'd be calling.
Some of this is gonna be on the fly, it'd be great if I had a little leeway.
Let Seth do his thing, you'll have your hands full with Doyle.
I'll let you know who I've called.
All right, let's get to work.
Sir?
Yes, what is it?
I understand that you need to delegate, but when you contradict me in front of Seth, it compromises my authority over him.
You can't micromanage, we have too much to do.
Seth is still new to the team.
I need to make sure that he's doing his job properly.
- Well, I think he is.
- I'm your fail-safe, sir.
But I can't be that if you won't let me.
Are you, Doug?
- My failsafe?
- Do you doubt that?
We're flying full throttle into a hurricane, and you're talking office politics instead of focusing on making sure we don't get ripped apart.
You're right, sir.
I shouldn't have brought it up.
- Is she still there?
- Yeah.
I told her I was going for a walk.
Look, Doug, I know you said you wanted her gone, but you have to understand...
She can stay.
- What?
- She doesn't have to leave, she can stay.
I trust you to be smart.
Will you read to me?
- My Bible's inside.
- Doesn't have to be the Bible.
Just pull up something on your phone.
- Like what?
- A Tale of Two Cities.
My mom used to read it to me.
"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom,
it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope,
it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way."
Hello?
Doug, is that you?
Hello?
Hello?
Doug?
Yes, Doug, it is you.
Well, look at that, Cashew.
Someone's being a bad boy.
"And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God,
"by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
"Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor
"and evil speaking be put away from you, with all malice.
"And be kind to one another.
"Tenderhearted.
Forgiving one another."
Do you want me to keep going with this or something else?
Doesn't matter to me.
I just like hearing you read it.
Doug, there's something I need to talk to you about.
You said that she was just staying for a few nights.
Her roommate kicked her out.
She doesn't have anywhere else to go.
That's not our problem.
Well, I can't just put her out on the street.
What's her name?
- Lisa.
- Lisa what?
You don't have anything to worry about.
- Where is she now?
- At the fellowship.
There's a sleepover with some of the kids in the daycare.
Does she know about me?
No.
I haven't told her anything.
I have given you space.
I trusted you, Rachel, and you've taken...
I'm not kicking her out.
I could've said nothing, but I told you.
I have to go.
She better be gone by the next time we talk.
- You want me to brief commerce...
- Sir.
What took you so long?
I can have a briefing ready for you in five minutes.
Don't bother.
I had Seth do it.
- He doesn't have security clearance.
- Well, he does now.
Mr. President, after you.
I'll see you in my office.
Japanese sovereignty is a matter of precedent.
Mr. Prime Minister, my concern is escalation.
Well, I'm asking for a small portion of the Seventh Fleet.
We must bring China into line.
Show them that the US and Japan maintain a strong alliance.
Have you reached out directly to Beijing?
No recognition that the island belongs to Japan.
Well, I'd like to speak to my team and formulate a plan.
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.
Admiral, for those catching up.
Two Chinese destroyers entered waters within three miles of Yonaguni Island here, approximately six hours ago.
You can see how close the island is to Taiwan.
Now this is different than the standoff over the Senkaku Islands.
It could have to do with shipping routes.
Or the trade war.
They can't pick on the big kid, so they're picking on the little one.
- Did you see that?
- What?
In the alley.
Camera two.
All posts.
White male, hooded sweatshirt.
Duffel bag.
Southeast side of Fair Street.
Put down the bag.
Put down the bag and place your hands on your head.
Stay right where you are.
Mrs. Underwood?
Will you come downstairs, please?
Where's Francis?
He got delayed at the White House.
There was an emergency meeting.
- What's going on?
- I'll explain in the safe room.
- The Seventh Fleet is near Guam?
- Ninety miles north.
We could have ships to Yonaguni in less than a week.
But even sending them in that direction will be picked up by the Chinese satellites.
We have to stand with our allies.
That can't be in question.
What if we don't send ships?
Just make a strong statement condemning their excursion into Japan's territorial waters.
We still have to offer the Chinese an incentive to call back their destroyers.
Whatever overtures we make, I'd like to have contingency plans in place.
Already drafting them, sir.
Cathy, open up a diplomatic channel with Beijing.
See if there's a concrete ask.
If they don't have one, let's create a list of options.
Right away, sir.
How about coordination with the Japanese navy?
Go.
Don't engage with their navy yet.
I want to talk directly to Prime Minister Oshiro and express our intentions.
Former Marine.
He showed up at the outer perimeter with explosives in a duffel bag
- and strapped to his body.
- Jesus.
We apprehended him.
The press isn't aware.
- Well, let's keep it that way.
- He claimed he was responsible for sending the package of white powder to the Capitol.
So this time he really wanted to take me out for real.
Not exactly.
His wife got an abortion last week without telling him.
Oh, my God.
It was me.
Yes, you were the target.
We'd like to keep you down here with us, Mrs. Underwood, until we can confirm he was acting alone.
I'll stay.
No.
You have to get back to the White House.
No, but I can work from here.
Francis, I'm fine.
Honestly.
I'm just gonna be in here.
I want you to stick with her at all times.
Keep me informed of everything.
He's almost done with his shift, sir.
I can put another agent...
No, I want it to be Meechum.
Absolutely, sir.
As long as necessary.
- I'll be back as soon as I can.
- Okay.
It's okay.
Don't go to California.
It'd be nice to be reelected.
You're gonna win.
Not if I don't give the voters more face time.
When'd you get it?
The Army?
Yeah.
It's grown since then.
Tell me about it.
No.
Why not?
I don't want to.
What are you doing?
Tell me about the tattoo.
- That's not fair.
- So what?
You think you can just get me wet and I'll spill everything?
I think so.
I know so.
Tell me.
I like the pain.
Of the needle?
Yeah.
How bad did it hurt?
It hurt a lot.
You like when it hurts?
I killed a lot of people.
What?
In the Army.
The pain, it helped.
Finish.
Most I could find was some wrangling with the EPA when he opened his first plant, but that was almost 40 years ago.
We need more.
I want Tusk gone.
Doyle and I will keep looking.
If you haven't found anything now, what makes you think you will?
Maybe we missed something.
I doubt it, but we could try.
You think Tusk isn't planning his next attack even as we speak?
We've been thorough, sir.
He doesn't leave footprints.
You want to shift tactics?
The casino.
We go public as soon as possible.
You said that was a last resort.
Seth, you need to find a way to make that happen so it doesn't link back to us.
If we launch that missile, it could blow us up, too.
Not if we spin it right.
If we keep the focus on...
Seth, you're here to listen.
Not contribute.
I wouldn't have him here if I didn't want him to contribute.
Sir, he's been sitting with this for three hours.
I've been working on it for three months.
And accomplished nothing.
It's time we go on the offensive.
- What are you thinking?
- Ayla Sayyad.
She's already digging into Tusk and Feng.
- How close is she?
- She never mentioned a casino.
But now that I know what the dots are,
I can see that she's starting to connect them.
The Pentagon isn't talking yet.
I imagine they're waiting on the White House.
I hear there have been regular meetings in the Situation Room since last night.
Let me call you right back.
- Hello?
- Hey, Lynn.
It's Ayla.
- I just sent you a picture.
- Yeah, I got it.
- What does it mean?
- It's strange.
It doesn't really make sense.
Tell me.
"Pursue currency" would be the most literal translation.
Or "pursue money."
- "Follow the money"?
- That could work.
Thanks, Lynn.
I like what you've done.
The sofa is new.
These lamps as well.
I've made a few changes.
Yeah, you get so used to a place, the smallest things stand out.
I apologize for not being responsive sooner.
- I've been focused on the midterms.
- There's no need to explain.
Mrs. Underwood, you know how much I respect your intentions.
But I've thought deeply about this, and I can't co-sponsor the bill in its current form.
Civilian oversight is too extreme a step.
But I'd be happy to revisit some of the other, less extreme proposals.
You think we're being extremist?
I want to help with this issue, but this bill goes against...
This bill is through Armed Services.
This bill has a date on the floor.
Almost every woman in the House supports this bill.
And I can't be one of them.
- So you lied to us.
- I didn't lie.
I didn't lie.
I want to help.
As long as we rethink some of the language...
Are you trying to distance yourself from us because of the Galloway scandal?
- No.
- Maybe you think it hurts your chances of reelection if you associate with me.
That's not it.
It's because I honestly don't believe in this approach.
Do you realize the message this sends?
The only woman in Congressional leadership, in both parties, and you bow out?
If the bill goes to the floor as is, I won't just bow out.
I'll actively fight it.
You never asked my position.
You assumed.
I can't imagine what that position must be.
I've served in war zones.
I know first-hand how important chain of command...
We're not talking about war zones.
We're talking about sexual assault.
How about a military commission to review the internal mechanisms...
We don't need more studies.
We need reform.
Well, let's continue this conversation when I return from California.
I'll be back the day after tomorrow, if you change your mind.
I won't.
But I hope you change yours.
China was insulted at the notion we could buy them off.
Well, do I need to call President Qian?
I doubt he would contradict one of his ministers.
See if he's willing to talk one-on-one.
You should know, sir,
Japan is also preparing to deploy three destroyers and a light cruiser.
They're upping the ante.
Have Ambassador Hynes get in touch with the Prime Minister.
Ask if Japan will hold off until I've made contact with Beijing.
Yes, sir.
- Have you gotten any rest at all?
- No.
Have you?
Not yet.
How's Claire?
The Secret Service thinks it's an isolated attempt.
But they're being cautious.
After the Galloway thing and the interview, half the country thinks she's a baby killer or an adulterer, or both.
But Claire's taking it in stride, and we're in good hands.
Well, it's very frightening.
I can see why you haven't slept.
One of us should.
Probably the one who's calling all the shots.
No, I can hold out a little while longer.
No, go to the residence.
Spend some time with your wife.
You'll come back feeling like a new man.
Honestly, it's less stressful here.
- Counseling hasn't helped.
- No, it has.
Slowly.
You know, I got rid of Christina when Linda resigned?
I heard.
It's improved things some.
But there's still work to do.
Makes me tired just to think about it.
Well, you probably wouldn't be the first president to get a little shut-eye on one of these sofas.
- I was joking.
- I wasn't.
Do the free world a favor and get some rest.
I'll let you be.
No, stick around.
You should be nearby if President Qian wants to get on the phone.
I've always loathed the necessity of sleep.
Like death, it puts even the most powerful men on their backs.
KC Limo and Bus Rental.
I'm calling from the Adohi Casino's travel department.
- We've got a corporate account.
- Let's see.
Yeah, I'm sorry, we don't have one in our records.
My mistake.
I must have called the wrong limo service.
Thank you.
Missouri Bus and Limo.
I'm calling from the Adohi Casino's travel department.
- You're not Darlene.
- No.
Darlene is out sick.
I'm filling in for her.
My name is Pam.
How can I help you, Pam?
We've got a flight coming in from China tomorrow.
We'll need some transportation.
How many you got coming?
I don't have the manifest right in front of me.
- The usual?
- That's right.
So a luxury bus.
How many does that fit?
Fifty-five.
Usually about 20 come in.
Should be plenty of room.
That's great.
Thanks.
Do you think it's really her conscience or because the bill is controversial?
I don't think she would have threatened to fight us if all she wanted to do was avoid controversy.
I'll talk to her.
- I really want this bill to pass.
- I know you do.
So do I.
We need Jackie more than ever, Francis.
I'm damaged goods with this whole Adam thing.
No, you're not.
We fought past that.
Well, there's plenty of people who still believe it's true.
We'll get it passed.
I promise.
No, thanks.
Come on.
It's no fun doing it alone.
We could just go for a run.
No more runs until the death threats die down.
That's the new rule.
- But they let you go to the office.
- Because I was in a bulletproof car.
Does this mean that we've officially not quit?
We've never been quitters, have we?
Sir, Mrs. Underwood.
Sorry to interrupt.
I was gonna head home, but I'll stick around if you want me to.
No.
You've been up long enough.
Get some sleep.
I'll be back first thing in the morning.
Thank you for looking after me today.
My pleasure, ma'am.
Sir.
Mrs. Underwood.
He's very dedicated.
He is.
It's rare to find someone like Edward.
- What?
- You never use his first name.
Did I?
I don't feel right talking about her like this.
It's just...
Technically she's my boss now.
And there's a certain protocol.
This is coming directly from Doug, which means it's coming directly from the Vice President.
Well, I have seen Mr. Danton around from time to time.
Do you know what he and the Congresswoman were discussing?
No.
They were private meetings.
Do you have the appointment schedule?
I'd like to look at the dates.
These weren't formal appointments.
He just stops by.
Most of the time, pretty late at night.
Did the money originate in China?
The money came from tribal revenue, as our FEC reports clearly state.
Let me rephrase.
Did any of that revenue come from Chinese visitors who gambled at your casino?
We have visitors from all over the world.
I'm speaking specifically about a businessman named Xander Feng.
I have no idea who that is.
I'm looking at FAA flight records that show a private plane he owns making numerous trips to Kansas City.
And I spoke with Missouri Bus and Limo, which has transported Chinese visitors to your casino.
- Miss Syed...
- Sayyad.
Miss Sayyad.
The only reason I returned your call was because you work for the Telegraph.
And it's not every day that I get a call from a paper as big as yours.
But I really don't know what you're trying to get at here,
- so if you'll excuse me...
- What about Raymond Tusk?
What about him?
Feng has ties to Tusk.
Tusk has ties to the President.
You have ties to Feng.
That looks like foreign money being used to influence political...
What you're insinuating is not only wrong, it's libelous.
Not if it's true.
I won't bat an eyelash getting my attorneys involved.
Tusk made the same threat.
If a man worth $40 billion doesn't intimidate me, you certainly don't, Mr. Lan...
Hello?
He hung up.
I had nothing to do with it, Raymond.
I can smell the horseshit through the phone.
You think I'd put myself at this great a risk?
Desperate men are capable of anything.
I want it to go away just like you do.
Then pull her back.
I have no control over the press, Raymond.
You'll destroy yourself, Frank.
Not me.
Thank you for that unsolicited advice.
Work with Doyle.
Make sure we have no weak spots.
- I'll call him now.
- What did Nancy say?
Well, it looks like Jackie may be sleeping with the enemy.
Lanagin is correct in saying we run the risk of libel.
These links are supported by fact.
Individually, but you can't complete the circle.
I'm not saying the headline should read
"Money Laundering Scheme Exposed," exclamation point.
Just that we present the landscape as we currently know it.
We're first and foremost a financial paper.
Many of our readers worship Raymond Tusk.
- So we just protect him?
- No.
We don't insinuate connections we can't back up.
If there's any basis for litigation, you can be sure his team will be aggressive.
Yeah, they've bankrupted papers before.
I think you should slow down and take your time.
When and if you have a story you can fully...
Mr. Maxfield?
Raymond Tusk is on the line.
- Did you put in a call to him?
- Yesterday.
He's specifically asking for you, sir.
We got off the phone with Lanagin less than 30 minutes ago.
That means that Tusk was the first call Lanagin made.
Tell him I'll return.
Did you reach out to the White House?
They're not talking to anyone until after the President does his press briefing tomorrow.
All right.
Walk me through all of this again, point by point.
- Meechum.
- We can talk tomorrow, sir.
No.
What is it?
I'd like to put in a request to be on your wife's detail full-time.
At least until the death threats quiet down.
That's very thoughtful.
I'll only do it if you approve, sir.
- Have you spoken to Claire?
- When she came home.
- She likes the idea.
- Then I think we should do it.
I'll let Agent Rockland know.
Sorry for interrupting you, sir.
You didn't interrupt anything.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Meechum.
What the fifth district needs is someone who understands...
Hey.
Hey.
You will never believe what just happened.
What?
Meechum came into the office and found me watching something other than the news.
No.
He was very professional about it.
- Were you...
- No, no, no.
I was just watching.
That's really funny.
What about you?
What are you watching?
The video Connor gave me.
It's our first state senate race.
I forgot about that.
So did I, until I found it in the desk this morning.
Let me see.
...been there like I have.
Of course, it doesn't hurt to have a little Texas in the mix.
- My God.
Look how young we are.
- I know.
Everyone here has been so kind, so welcoming.
We'll have her rooting for Clemson before too long.
Now that's where I have to draw the line.
Do you miss being with Adam?
Where did that come from?
Miss it?
No.
Well, you must.
Sometimes.
He meant a lot to me for a while.
But that's done now.
What about you?
What about me?
Are you unsatisfied?
There's just too much at stake now.
No one we can trust.
We don't have the freedom we once did.
Maybe it's better this way.
No room for distractions.
I don't mind the sacrifice.
We chose this instead.
Well, I think the one thing we can agree on is the ribs here are better.
You see, he's just trying to get under my skin now.
It's not even debatable.
No offense to...
How's California?
Exhausting.
Twelve events in two days.
Is this the Golden Gate?
Yes.
I had an etching right there of the Capitol before it was finished.
Took 85 years to complete it.
How long did it take to complete the bridge?
About four years.
It opened a few months after FDR's second inaugural.
There was a man who got things done.
Strong beliefs.
And he stuck to them.
But compromised when he had to.
I assume you're here to talk about Claire's bill.
It's not a pet project.
There are three dozen co-sponsors on either side of the aisle.
- It's a serious bill.
- I don't disagree.
Except with the language.
I can explain my thinking, but I doubt I'll convince you any more than you'll convince me.
Putting aside the military's honor, chain of command, all the things that you hold dear,
let's consider one simple fact.
You wouldn't have this office if it weren't for me.
I made very clear that I wouldn't be a puppet.
I'm not trying to pull strings.
But you could show a little gratitude.
If it were anything else, Mr. Vice President.
But not this.
All you're doing is making the inevitable more difficult.
It's not inevitable.
Claire doesn't have the votes yet.
You really want to fight us on this?
I don't want to fight you at all, which is why I suggested to Claire that we sit down...
I neither have the time nor the inclination to negotiate with you!
Co-sponsor the bill!
Whip the damn votes!
I'm no longer asking!
Then I'm no longer listening.
You don't have just this office to thank me for.
If you win reelection, you can thank me for that, too.
Those attack ads didn't just disappear on their own.
What do you mean?
Why don't you ask Remy Danton?
And ask him about Raymond Tusk while you're at it.
That ought to make for some very interesting pillow talk.
You keep up the good work, Nancy.
I will, Mr. Vice President.
I miss having you around.
But you're my eyes and ears now.
Otherwise I'd steal you back in a heartbeat.
Well, thank you, sir.
It means a lot to me that you say that.
- Doug.
- I'm busy.
The story just broke.
They timed it with the President's press conference.
Connect me with the Vice President.
So the Seventh Fleet is currently positioned near Guam, where it will remain if China removes its ships from Japan's sovereign waters.
I've been in frequent touch with Prime Minister Oshiro and have made personal overtures to President Qian.
And I remain optimistic that tensions will be quelled without any further escalations.
So with that, I'll take some questions.
- Mr. President!
- Henry, you first.
Can you comment on the Wall Street Telegraph article, which suggests...
Yeah, I was just notified of that moments before I joined you.
I haven't had a chance to read it yet.
Yeah, Jane?
Mr. President, would you walk us through your history with Raymond Tusk?
I'm here to answer questions on Sino-Japanese relations.
Mark?
The article mentions Xander Feng, a wealthy and influential Chinese businessman...
Unless this has to do with the statement I just made...
It does, Mr. President.
Feng has ties to the standing committee.
And we're currently in a standoff with the Chinese.
- Economically...
- All right, thank you all very much.
It's not beginning the story that I fear.
It's not knowing how it will end.
Everyone is fair game now.
Including me.
This is par for the course from what we come to expect from President Walker.
Whenever he's selling a shiny new car, he can't say enough about it.
The engine breaks down, the transmission gives out, he dodges, he ignores the warranty.
Well, I'm gonna tell you something.
Our warranty is the Constitution of the United States.
And there's no limit on that.
He needs to read the fine print and start answering our questions.
If any of this is true, we're talking Congress, the White House, both parties.
Now, I'm saying "if."
But when it looks like dirty money and it smells like dirty money, somebody has probably got dirt under their nails.
There's no real proof this money laundering even...
But the connections are troubling.
Especially Underwood.
He was the House whip the entire time the Adohi were contributing to the Democrats.
And he's working side by side with the President now.
The President.
So this goes all the way to the White House?
- It might.
- That's hypothetical.
And by the way, you've cherry-picked the facts to make your case.
I'm not making a case.
My headline is "PAC Money Raises Questions." And it has.
I haven't answered those questions, but I think the American people deserve answers, don't you?
You can bet your bottom dollar the Attorney General is going to investigate.
With the firestorm this is causing in the media...
So what's our course of action?
As your counsel, I will encourage you not to speak to the press until we have more information.
As your average citizen, the longer you wait, the more suspicious it looks.
If there's been any irregularity, I had nothing to do with it.
Your friendship with Tusk implies guilt by association.
Are we presuming guilt before innocence?
I'm a lawyer.
I presume nothing.
But public opinion doesn't have a law degree.
Give us a few moments.
I have to advise you not to have any conversation about this matter without me present.
Your advisement has been noted.
I'll be right outside.
Is this what you were keeping from me?
We should follow your counsel's advice and not...
Tell me if it's true.
About the money.
With Bill out of the room, we open ourselves up to all sorts...
Damn it, Frank.
I've been in the dark for too long on this.
That ends now.
I don't know any details.
Feng told me if the bridge project got approved, the GOP would stop getting money.
- We approved it.
The money stopped.
- Jesus Christ.
That connects the White House directly to the money.
No, sir.
You knew nothing.
You still know nothing.
If the DOJ finds any concrete evidence of foreign money...
Then that's Raymond Tusk's head, not yours.
You've done nothing wrong.
Guilt by association, Frank.
You heard the man.
If the DOJ investigates, it will only prove your innocence.
Nobody walks away from something like this without bruises.
Well, bruises you can survive.
I just don't know how we can avoid it at this point.
Unless you want to accelerate the process and get rid of it.
You could always have the Attorney General appoint a special prosecutor.
That's a terrible idea.
Maybe so.
And given where we are, Frank,
I'm not inclined to follow your suggestions.
Well, I wasn't suggesting it as something you should do.
Just as a possibility.
No, in fact, I don't think you should.
I think it's better to drag these things out as long as possible.
Let the public fatigue on it.
And have it hanging over our heads until the midterms?
- It'll lose steam.
- What if it doesn't?
I've got the Pentagon proposing tactical drone strikes in the South China Sea.
I can't be dealing with something like this for months on end.
Maybe you're right, then.
A special prosecutor is the way to go.
I didn't say that.
You did.
No, I just meant in terms of getting it off your plate.
It wouldn't be on my plate if you'd kept me better informed.
I have done nothing but try to insulate you, sir.
Is that what you call the feeding frenzy I went through?
I make this solemn promise to you, Mr. President.
I will take the fall if it comes to that, but it won't.
However you decide to deal with this, I think your instincts are right.
Probably shouldn't involve a special prosecutor.
Send Bill back in.
You knew about this.
Tusk is a client.
Doesn't mean I know everything he...
Bullshit.
The reason you're a partner at Glendon Hill is because you know the things nobody else does.
- What do you want me to say?
- Is it true?
We don't talk about work.
We're not in bed.
We're in my fucking office.
- And in here, you work for Frank.
- I work for no one but myself.
Keep telling yourself that.
Unlike you, I don't peddle my goods for whoever can pay the highest retainer.
I'm the bitch to a lot of top dogs.
I'm fully aware and willing.
But you're worse.
You're Frank's bitch and refuse to believe it.
That's not true.
- Case in fucking point.
- Don't turn this.
You knew about the money and you didn't tell me, even though it's thrown my seat into contention.
Let's say there was money.
And let's say I did know.
What good would it have done?
It means you were willing to watch me lose.
It means I respected the boundaries that you demanded.
- No changes, no special treatment.
- This is different.
- So now we're making exceptions?
- When it's this important, yes.
You can't have it both ways.
Were you...
Was I what?
Fucking me to get info on Frank.
- Is that what you think?
- I don't know what to think.
I care about you more than I should.
But I'm getting tired of having to say it.
He's being moved to a federal psychiatric facility for assessment, then a high-security detention center until the official sentencing.
Well, that's good to hear.
The bad news is we don't want you doing any public events for a while.
My bill is about to go to the floor.
I need to have a public profile.
Your death threats continue to rise.
We can't take the risk.
Am I even allowed to leave the house?
Of course.
But we want you to avoid large crowds.
Our ability to protect...
Mr. Vice President.
Is anything wrong?
We were just briefing Mrs. Underwood on our new security protocol.
- Can we actually finish this later?
- Of course.
How did it go?
He's skeptical.
- Should I call Tricia?
- No.
Could look like I was trying to go behind his back.
We'll just have to wait and see.
I made my case.
And hopefully he'll disagree with it.
This could have been the wrong move.
Well, don't doubt yourself.
Seth has gotten over 3,000 emails in the last six hours.
The phones are overloaded.
So you ignore all that.
I can't ignore the Department of Justice.
What can I do?
Come and visit me when I'm in prison.
You don't have to stand by that door.
Take a load off.
Thank you, sir, but I'm supposed to stay on my feet.
Well, I won't tell if you won't.
And if anybody gives you any trouble about this, or anything, they can talk to me.
- Beautiful night.
- Yes, sir.
It's been strange not having you around these last few days.
You want me to switch back to your detail?
No, no.
I'm glad you're with Claire.
I just didn't realize how much I got used to your company until you were gone.
Protecting her is the same as protecting you in my mind.
Come on.
Why do you do this?
Do what, sir?
I've always been awestruck.
People who are willing to take a bullet for someone else.
It's how I serve my country.
Well, there's a lot of ways to serve your country.
And this is my way.
I haven't finished with this one yet.
It's not for you.
I can't drink on duty, ma'am.
It's not for you either.
Well, come on over and join the party.
Haven't you got sick of seeing my face yet?
Never, ma'am.
To Meechum, for his loyalty and service.
To Edward.
I'm on my way to my lawyer's office, Remy.
That's not where I want to be when I'd usually be in bed.
I can't stop Frank from leaking things.
No, but you can make sure he suffers more than us.
And I say us, Remy, because your skin is in this game now, too.
- Are you going to deny?
- Of course I'm gonna deny.
Every step of this was legal.
They can't prove the links between them.
- What about Lanagin?
- He'll cooperate.
It's Feng we need to worry about.
I'll find a way to get in touch with him.
We do have one major advantage.
The public can hate me, but as long as Clayton West remains profitable, my stockholders won't care.
Frank doesn't have the same liberty.
Public opinion can demolish him.
You need to make sure that happens.
I could work with the Republicans on that.
They'll be under the magnifying glass, too.
This'll be a witch hunt.
Then I'll make sure that they pick the right targets.
What you need to do is go after the leadership.
Make them hurt.
They'll turn on Frank to save themselves.
Birch.
Womack.
Sharp.
Especially Jackie Sharp.
She's his chosen one.
Remy?
I heard you, yeah.
I got my marching orders.
- I'm counting on you.
- I'll deliver.
Let's talk in the morning.
The two names I like the most are Justin Gaines and Heather Dunbar.
Gaines has better credentials.
But he's close to the administration.
We would've made him a federal judge if the GOP hadn't blocked it.
That's an important point.
Dunbar's got grit.
She's more than qualified.
And there's no baggage there.
But she's more unpredictable.
I doubt the Attorney General would have put her on his list if he thought she was a wild card.
Sir, I have to say, I think this step is premature.
We should hold off and see what the DOJ does on its own.
I don't want to do it, Bill.
But my fear is this, if we wait until the water goes from hot to boiling, we seem reactionary, not proactive.
But proactive could also seem defensive.
Like the suspect that screams "I didn't do it" before anyone asks.
Aside from that, we simply haven't had time to prepare.
- Maybe wait a couple of weeks.
- No, that defeats the purpose.
- Then a few days.
- I'd like to go with Dunbar.
- Sir...
- I've made my decision.
Bill, I'd like you to convey my wishes to the Attorney General.
Ultimately the decision is his.
We can't appear to be pressuring.
Of course not.
Thank you, sir.
The only thing more satisfying than convincing someone to do what I want is failing to persuade them on purpose.
It's like a "do not enter" sign.
It just begs you to walk through the door.
Doyle's about halfway through our initial background check.
Every donor, every political event.
Anything that Dunbar might be looking into.
Good.
Seth?
We avoid any official statement.
Follow the President's cue.
In the meantime I'd like to make some off-the-record calls.
You welcome the investigation, it's the right step, et cetera.
Give folks the personal touch.
That's fine, as long as we don't come off defensive.
I'd like to see a list of who you'll be calling.
Some of this is gonna be on the fly.
It'd be great if I had a little leeway...
Yeah, let Seth do his thing.
You'll have your hands full with Doyle.
- I'll let you know who I call.
- All right.
Let's get to work.
Sir?
Yes, what is it?
I understand that you need to delegate.
But when you contradict me in front of Seth, it compromises my authority over him.
You can't micromanage.
We have too much to do.
Seth is still new to the team.
I need to make sure that he's doing his job properly.
Well, I think he is.
I am your failsafe, sir.
But I can't be that if you won't let me.
Are you, Doug?
My failsafe?
Do you doubt that?
We're flying full throttle into a hurricane, and you're talking office politics instead of focusing on making sure we don't get ripped apart.
You're right, sir.
I shouldn't have brought it up.
Is she still there?
Yeah.
I told her I was going for a walk.
Look, Doug, I know you said you wanted her gone, but you have to understand that all I'm asking...
She can stay.
What?
She doesn't have to leave.
She can stay.
I trust you to be smart.
Will you read to me?
My Bible is inside.
Doesn't have to be the Bible.
Just pull up something on your phone.
Like what?
Tale of Two Cities.
My mom used to read it to me.
"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,
"it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness,
"it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity,
"it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness,
"it was the spring of hope, the winter of despair,
"we had everything before us, we had nothing before us,
"we were all going direct to heaven,
"we were all going direct the other way..."
Hello?
Doug, is that you?
Hello?
Hello?
Doug...
Yes, Doug.
It is you.
(LOUD MUSIC PLAYING)
(BEEPING)
(BEEPING)
Well, look at that, Cashew.
Someone's being a bad boy.
"And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God,
"by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
"Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor
"and evil speaking be put away from you, with all malice.
"And be kind to one another.
"Tenderhearted.
Forgiving one another."
Do you want me to keep going with this or something else?
Doesn't matter to me.
I just like hearing you read it.
Doug, there's something I need to talk to you about
You said that she was just staying for a few nights.
Her roommate kicked her out.
She doesn't have anywhere else to go.
That's not our problem.
Well, I can't just put her out on the street.
What's her name?
Lisa.
Lisa what?
You don't have anything to worry about
Where is she now?
At the fellowship.
There's a sleepover with some of the kids in the daycare.
Does she know about me?
No.
I haven't told her anything.
I have given you space.
I trusted you, Rachel, and you've taken...
I'm not kicking her out.
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)
I could've said nothing, but I told you.
I have to go.
She better be gone by the next time we talk.
You want me to brief commerce...
DOUG:
Sir.
What took you so long?
I can have a briefing ready for you in five minutes.
Don't bother.
I had Seth do it.
He doesn't have security clearance.
Well, he does now.
Mr. President, after you.
I'll see you in my office.
Japanese sovereignty is a matter of precedent.
Mr. Prime Minister, my concern is escalation.
Well, Fm asking for a small portion of the Seventh Fleet.
We must bring China into line.
Show them that the US and Japan maintain a strong alliance.
Have you reached out directly to Beijing?
No recognition that the island belongs to Japan.
Well, I'd like to speak to my team and formulate a plan.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.
Admiral, for those catching up.
Two Chinese destroyers entered waters within three miles of Yonaguni Island here, approximately six hours ago.
You can see how close the island is to Taiwan.
Now this is different than the standoff over the Senkaku Islands.
It could have to do with shipping routes.
FRANCIS:
Or the trade war.
They can't pick on the big kid.
so they're picking on the little one.
Did you see that?
What?
In the alley.
Camera two.
All units.
White male, hooded sweatshirt
Duffel bag.
Southeast side of Fair Street.
(RADIO CHATTER)
MAN OVER LOUDSPEAKER:
Put down the bag.
Put down the bag and place your hands on your head.
Stay right where you are.
(SIREN BLARING)
Mrs. Underwood?
Will you come downstairs, please?
Where's Francis?
He got delayed at the White House.
There was an emergency meeting.
What's going on?
I'll explain in the safe room.
WALKER:
The Seventh Fleet is near Guam?
Ninety miles north.
We could have ships to Yonaguni in less than a week.
But even sending them in that direction will be picked up by the Chinese satellites.
We have to stand with our allies.
That can't be in question.
What if we don't send ships?
Just make a strong statement condemning their excursion into Japan's territorial waters.
We still have to offer the Chinese an incentive to call back their destroyers.
Whatever overtures we make,
I'd like lo have contingency plans in place.
Already drafting them, sir.
Cathy, open up a diplomatic channel with Beijing.
See if there's a concrete ask.
If they don't have one, let's create a list of options.
Right away, sir.
MAN:
How about coordination with the Japanese navy?
(WHISPERING)
Go.
Don't engage with their navy yet.
I want to talk directly to Prime Minister Oshiro and express our intentions.
Former Marine.
He showed up at the outer perimeter with explosives in a duffel bag and strapped to his body.
Jesus.
We apprehended him.
The press isn't aware.
Well, let's keep it that way.
He claimed he was responsible for sending the package of white powder to the Capitol.
So this time he really wanted to take me out for real.
Not exactly.
His wife got an abortion last week without telling him.
Oh, my God.
It was me.
Yes, you were the target.
We'd like to keep you down here with us, Mrs. Underwood, until we can confirm he was acting alone.
I'll stay.
No.
You have to get back to the White House.
No, but I can work from here.
Francis, I'm fine.
Honestly.
I'm just gonna be in here.
I want you to stick with her at all times.
Keep me informed of everything.
He's almost done with his shift, sir.
I can put another agent...
No, I want it to be Meechum.
Absolutely, sir.
As long as necessary.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Okay.
It's okay.
REMY:
Don't go to California.
JACKIE:
Hmm, it'd be nice to be reelected.
REMY:
You're gonna win.
Not if I don't give the voters more face time.
When'd you get it?
The Army?
Yeah. it's grown since then.
Tell me about it.
No.
Why not?
I don't want to.
(GASPS)
What are you doing?
Tell me about the tattoo.
Mmm.
That's not fair.
(CHUCKLES) So what?
You think you can just get me wet and I'll spill everything?
I think so.
(MOANS)
I know so.
(MOANS)
Tell me.
I like the pain.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Of the needle?
Yeah.
How bad did it hurt?
It hurt a lot.
You like when it hurls?
(GASPS)
I killed a lot of people.
What?
In the Army.
The pain, it helped.
Finish.
(EXHALES)
Most I could find was some wrangling with the EPA when he opened his first plant, but that was almost 40 years ago.
We need more.
I want Tusk gone.
Doyle and I will keep looking.
If you haven't found anything now, what makes you think you will?
Maybe we missed something.
I doubt it, but we could try.
You think Tusk isn't planning his next attack even as we speak?
We've been thorough, sir.
He doesn't leave footprints.
You want to shift tactics?
The casino.
We go public as soon as possible.
You said that was a last resort.
Seth, you need to find a way to make that happen so it doesn't link back to us.
DOUG:
If we launch that missile, it could blow us up, too.
GRAYSON:
Not if we spin it right.
If we keep the focus on...
Seth, you're here to listen.
Not contribute.
I wouldn't have him here if I didn't want him to contribute.
Sir, he's been sitting with this for three hours.
I've been working on it for three months.
And accomplished nothing.
Ifs time we go on the offensive.
What are you thinking?
GRAYSON:
Ayla Sayyad.
She's already digging into Tusk and Feng.
How close is she?
She never mentioned a casino.
But now that I know what the dots are,
I can see that she's starting to connect them.
SAYYAD:
The Pentagon isn't talking yet.
I imagine they're waiting on the White House.
I hear there have been regular meetings in the Situation Room since last night.
Uh, let me call you right back.
Hello?
Hey, Lynn.
It's Ayla.
I just sent you a picture.
Yeah, I got it.
What does it mean?
It's strange.
It doesn't realty make sense.
Tell me.
"Pursue currency" would be the most literal translation.
Or "pursue money"
"Follow the money"?
That could work.
Thanks, Lynn.
I like what you've done.
The sofa is new.
These lamps as well.
I've made a few changes.
Yeah, you get so used to a place, the smallest things stand out.
I apologize for not being responsive sooner.
I've been focused on the midterms.
Oh, there's no need to explain.
Mrs. Underwood, you know how much I respect your intentions.
But I've thought deeply about this, and I can't co-sponsor the bill in its current form.
Civilian oversight is too extreme a step.
But I'd be happy to revisit some of the other, less extreme proposals.
You think we're being extremist?
I want to help with this issue, but this bill goes against...
This bill is through Armed Services.
This bill has a date on the floor.
Almost every woman in the House supports this bill.
And I can't be one of them.
So you lied to us.
I didn't lie.
I didn't lie.
I want to help.
As long as we rethink some of the language...
Are you trying to distance yourself from us because of the Galloway scandal?
No.
Maybe you think it hurts your chances of reelection if you associate with me.
That's not it.
It's because I honestly don't believe in this approach.
Do you realize the message this sends?
The only woman in Congressional leadership, in both parties, and you bow out?
If the bill goes to the floor as is, I won't just bow out.
I'll actively fight it.
You never asked my position.
You assumed.
I can't imagine what that position must be.
I've served in war zones.
I know first-hand how important chain of command...
We're not talking about war zones.
We're talking about sexual assault.
How about a military commission to review the internal mechanisms...
We don't need more studies.
We need reform.
Well, let's continue this conversation when I return from California.
I'll be back the day after tomorrow, if you change your mind.
I won't.
But I hope you change yours.
CATHERINE:
China was insulted at the notion we could buy them off.
Well, do I need to call President Qian?
I doubt he would contradict one of his ministers.
See if he's willing to talk one-on-one.
You should know, sir,
Japan is also preparing to deploy three destroyers and a light cruiser.
They're upping the ante.
Have Ambassador Hynes get in touch with the Prime Minister.
Ask if Japan will hold off until I've made contact with Beijing.
Yes, sir.
Have you gotten any rest at all?
No.
Have you?
Not yet.
How's Claire?
The Secret Service thinks it's an isolated attempt.
But they're being cautious.
After the Galloway thing and the interview, half the country thinks she's a baby killer or an adulterer, or both.
But Claire's taking it in stride, and we're in good hands.
Well, it's very frightening.
I can see why you haven't slept.
One of us should.
Probably the one who's calling all the shots.
No, I can hold out a little while longer.
No, go to the residence.
Spend some time with your wife.
You'll come back feeling like a new man.
Honestly, it's less stressful here.
Counseling hasn't helped.
No, it has.
Slowly.
You know, I got rid of Christina when Linda resigned?
I heard.
It's improved things some.
(EXHALES)
But there's still work to do.
Makes me tired just to think about it.
Well, you probably wouldn't be the first president to get a little shut-eye on one of these sofas.
I was joking.
I wasn't.
Do the free world a favor and get some rest.
I'll let you be.
No, stick around.
You should be nearby if President Qian wants to get on the phone.
(SIGHS)
I've always loathed the necessity of sleep.
Like death, it puts even the most powerful men on their backs.
(PHONE RINGING)
MAN:
KC Limo and Bus rental.
I'm calling from the Adohi Casino's travel department.
We've got a corporate account.
Let's see.
Yeah, I'm sorry, we don't have one in our records.
My mistake.
I must have called the wrong limo service.
Thank you.
WOMAN:
Missouri Bus and Limo.
I'm calling from the Adohi Casino's travel department.
You're not Darlene.
No.
Darlene is out sick.
I'm filling in for her.
My name is Pam.
How can I help you, Pam?
We've got a flight coming in from China tomorrow.
We'll need some transportation.
How many you got coming?
I don't have the manifest right in front of me.
The usual?
That's right.
So a luxury bus.
How many does that fit?
Fifty-five.
Usually about 20 come in.
Should be plenty of room.
That's great.
Thanks.
FRANCIS:
Do you think it's really her conscience or because the bill is controversial?
I don't think she would have threatened to fight us if all she wanted to do was avoid controversy.
I'll talk to her.
I really want this bill to pass.
I know you do.
So do I.
We need Jackie more than ever, Francis.
I'm damaged goods with this whole Adam thing.
No, you're not.
We fought past that
Well, there's plenty of people who still believe it's true.
We'll get it passed.
I promise.
No, thanks.
Come on.
It's no fun doing it alone.
We could just go for a run.
No more runs until the death threats die down.
That's the new rule.
But they let you go to the office.
Because I was in a bulletproof car.
Does this mean that we've officially not quit?
We've never been quitters, have we?
Sir, Mrs. Underwood.
Sorry to interrupt.
I was gonna head home, but I'll stick around if you want me to.
Oh, no.
You've been up long enough.
Get some sleep.
I'll be back first thing in the morning.
Thank you for looking after me today.
My pleasure, ma'am.
Sir.
Mrs. Underwood.
He's very dedicated.
He is.
It's rare to find someone like Edward.
What?
You never use his first name.
Oh, did I?
I don't feel right talking about her like this.
It's just...
Technically she's my boss now.
And there's a certain protocol.
GRAYSON:
This is coming directly from Doug, which means it's coming directly from the Vice President.
(SIGHS)
Well, I have seen Mr. Danton around from time to time.
Do you know what he and the Congresswoman were discussing?
No.
They were private meetings.
Do you have the appointment schedule?
I'd like to look at the dates.
These weren't formal appointments.
He just stops by.
Most of the time, pretty late at night.
SAYYAD:
Did the money originate in China'?
LANAGIN:
The money came from tribal revenue, as our FEC reports clearly state.
SAYYAD:
Let me rephrase.
Did any of that revenue come from Chinese visitors who gambled at your casino?
We have visitors from all over the world.
I'm speaking specifically about a businessman named Xander Feng.
I have no idea who that is.
I'm looking at FAA flight records that show a private plane he owns making numerous trips to Kansas City,.
And I spoke with Missouri Bus and Limo, which has transported Chinese visitors to your casino.
Miss Syed...
Sayyad.
Miss Sayyad.
The only reason I returned your call was because you work for the Telegraph.
And it's not every day that I get a call from a paper as big as yours.
But I really don't know what you're trying to get at here, so if you'll excuse me...
What about Raymond Tusk?
What about him?
Feng has ties to Tusk.
Tusk has ties to the President.
You have ties to Feng.
That looks like foreign money being used to influence political...
What you're insinuating is not only wrong, it's libelous.
Not if it's true.
I won't bat an eyelash getting my attorneys involved.
Tusk made the same threat.
If a man worth $40 billion doesn't intimidate me, you certainly don't, Mr. Lan... (CALL DISCONNECTS)
Hello?
He hung up.
FRANCIS:
I had nothing to do with it, Raymond.
I can smell the horseshit through the phone.
You think I'd put myself at this great a risk?
Desperate men are capable of anything.
I want it to go away just like you do.
Then pull her back.
I have no control over the press, Raymond.
You'll destroy yourself, Frank.
Not me.
Thank you for that unsolicited advice.
Work with Doyle.
Make sure we have no weak spots.
I'll call him now.
What did Nancy say?
Well, it looks like Jackie may be sleeping with the enemy.
Lanagin is correct in saying we run the risk of libel.
These links are supported by fact.
Individually, but you can't complete the circle.
I'm not saying the headline should read
"Money Laundering Scheme Exposed," exclamation point.
Just that we present the landscape as we currently know it.
We're first and foremost a financial paper.
Many of our readers worship Raymond Tusk.
So we just protect him?
No.
We don't insinuate connections we can't back up.
If there's any basis for litigation, you can be sure his team will be aggressive.
MR. MAXFIELD:
Yeah, they've bankrupted papers before.
MAN:
I think you should slow down and take your time.
When and if you have a story you can fully...
Mr. Maxfield?
Raymond Tusk is on the line.
Did you put in a call to him?
Yesterday.
EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT:
He's specifically asking for you, sir.
We got off the phone with Lanagin less than 30 minutes ago.
That means that Tusk was the first call Lanagin made.
Tell him I'll return.
Did you reach out to the While House?
They're not talking to anyone until after the President does his press briefing tomorrow.
All right.
Walk me through all of this again, point by point.
(SIGHS)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Meechum.
We can talk tomorrow, sir.
No.
What is it?
I'd like to put in a request to be on your wife's detail full-time.
At least until the death threats quiet down.
That's very thoughtful.
I'll only do it if you approve, sir.
Have you spoken to Claire?
When she came home.
She likes the idea.
Then I think we should do it.
I'll let Agent Rockland know.
Sorry for interrupting you, sir.
You didn't interrupt anything.
Good night, sir.
Good night, Meechum.
FRANCIS: (ON LAPTOP) What the fifth district needs is someone who understands...
FRANCIS:
Hey.
Hey.
You will never believe what just happened.
What?
Meechum came into the office and found me watching something other than the news.
(LAUGHING)
Oh, no.
He was very professional about it.
Were you...
No, no, no.
I was just watching.
That's really funny.
What about you?
What are you watching?
The video Connor gave me.
It's our first state senate race.
Oh, I forgot about that.
So did I, until I found it in the desk this morning.
Let me see.
FRANCIS: (ON LAPTOP) ...been there like I have.
Of course, it doesn't hurt to have a little Texas in the mix.
My God.
Look how young we are.
I know.
CLAIRE: (ON LAPTOP) Everyone here has been so kind, so welcoming.
FRANCIS:
We'll have her rooting for Clemson before too long,
CLAIRE:
Now that's where I have to draw the line.
Do you miss being with Adam?
Where did that come from?
Miss it?
No.
Well, you must.
Sometimes.
He meant a lot to me for a while.
But that's done now.
What about you?
What about me?
Are you unsatisfied?
There's just too much at stake now.
No one we can trust.
We don't have the freedom we once did.
Maybe it's better this way.
No room for distractions.
I don't mind the sacrifice.
We chose this instead.
FRANCIS:
Well, I think the one thing we can agree on is the ribs here are better.
CLAIRE:
You see, he's just trying to get under my skin now.
FRANCIS:
It's not even debatable.
No offense to...
Oh.
FRANCIS:
How's California?
Um...
Exhausting.
Twelve events in two days.
Is this the Golden Gate?
Yes.
I had an etching right there of the Capitol before it was finished.
Took 85 years to complete it.
How long did it take to complete the bridge?
Uh, about four years.
It opened a few months after FDR's second inaugural.
There was a man who got things done.
Strong beliefs.
And he stuck to them.
But compromised when he had to.
I assume you're here to talk about Claire's bill.
It's not a pet project.
There are three dozen co-sponsors on either side of the aisle.
It's a serious bill.
I don't disagree.
Except with the language.
I can explain my thinking, but I doubt I'll convince you any more than you'll convince me.
Putting aside the military's honor, chain of command, all the things that you hold dear,
let's consider one simple fact.
You wouldn't have this office if it weren't for me.
I made very clear that I wouldn't be a puppet.
I'm not trying to pull strings.
But you could show a little gratitude.
If it were anything else, Mr. Vice President.
But not this.
All you're doing is making the inevitable more difficult.
It's not inevitable.
Claire doesn't have the votes yet.
You really want to fight us on this?
I don't want to fight you at all, which is why I suggested to Claire that we sit down...
I neither have the time nor the inclination to negotiate with you!
Co-sponsor the bill!
Whip the damn votes!
I'm no longer asking!
Then I'm no longer listening.
You don't have just this office to thank me for.
If you win reelection, you can thank me for that, too.
Those attack ads didn't just disappear on their own.
What do you mean?
Why don't you ask Remy Danton?
And ask him about Raymond Tusk while you're at it.
That ought to make for some very interesting pillow talk.
(DOOR BANGS SHUT)
You keep up the good work, Nancy.
I will, Mr. Vice President.
I miss having you around.
But you're my eyes and ears now.
Otherwise I'd steal you back in a heartbeat.
Well, thank you, sir.
It means a lotto me that you say that.
Doug.
I'm busy.
The story just broke.
They timed it with the President's press conference.
Connect me with the Vice President.
WALKER:
So the Seventh Fleet is currently positioned near Guam, where it will remain if China removes its ships from Japan's sovereign waters.
I've been in frequent touch with Prime Minister Oshiro and have made personal overtures to President Qian.
And I remain optimistic that tensions will be quelled without any further escalations.
So with that, I'll take some questions.
REPORTERS:
Mr. President!
Henry, you first.
Can you comment on the Wall Street Telegraph article, which suggests...
Yeah, I was just notified of that moments before I joined you.
I haven't had a chance to read it yet.
Yeah, Jane?
Mr. President, would you walk us through your history with Raymond Tusk?
I'm here to answer questions on Sino-Japanese relations.
Mark?
The article mentions Xander Feng, a wealthy and influential Chinese businessman...
Unless this has to do with the statement I just made".
It does, Mr. President.
Feng has ties to the standing committee.
And we're currently in a standoff with the Chinese.
Economically...
All right, thank you all very much.
It's not beginning the story that I fear.
It's not knowing how it will end.
Everyone is fair game now.
Including me.
SEAN HANNITY:
This is par for the course from what we come to expect from President Walker.
Whenever he's selling a shiny new car, he can't say enough about it.
The engine breaks down, the transmission gives out, he dodges, he ignores the warranty.
Well, I'm gonna tell you something.
Our warranty is the Constitution of the United States.
And there's no limit on that.
He needs to read the fine print and start answering our questions.
If any of this is true, we're talking Congress, the White House, both parties.
Now, I'm saying "if."
But when it looks like dirty money and it smells like dirty money, somebody has probably got dirt under their nails.
There's no real proof this money laundering even...
But the connections are troubling.
Especially Underwood.
He was the House whip the entire time the Adohi were contributing to the Democrats.
And he's working side by side with the President now.
The President.
So this goes all the way to the White House?
It might.
That's hypothetical.
And by the way, you've cherry-picked the facts to make your case.
I'm not making a case.
My headline is "PAC Money Raises Questions." And it has.
I haven't answered those questions, but I think the American people deserve answers, don't you?
You can bet your bottom dollar the Attorney General is going to investigate.
With the firestorm this is causing in the media...
So what's our course of action?
As your counsel, I will encourage you not to speak to the press until we have more information.
As your average citizen, the longer you wait, the more suspicious it looks.
If there's been any irregularity, I had nothing to do with it.
Your friendship with Tusk implies guilt by association.
Are we presuming guilt before innocence?
I'm a lawyer.
I presume nothing.
But public opinion doesn't have a law degree.
Give us a few moments.
I have to advise you not to have any conversation about this matter without me present.
Your advisement has been noted.
I'll be right outside.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Is this what you were keeping from me?
We should follow your counsel's advice and not."
Tell me if it's true.
About the money.
With Bill out of the room, we open ourselves up to all sorts...
Damn it, Frank.
I've been in the dark for too long on this.
That ends now.
I don't know any details.
Feng told me if the bridge project got approved, the GOP would stop getting money.
We approved it.
The money stopped.
Jesus Christ.
That connects the White House directly to the money.
No, sir.
You knew nothing.
You still know nothing.
If the DOJ finds any concrete evidence of foreign money...
Then that's Raymond Tusk's head, not yours.
You've done nothing wrong.
Guilt by association, Frank.
You heard the man.
If the DOJ investigates, it will only prove your innocence.
Nobody walks away from something like this without bruises.
Well, bruises you can survive.
I just don't know how we can avoid it at this point.
Unless you want to accelerate the process and get rid of it.
You could always have the Attorney General appoint a special prosecutor.
That's a terrible idea.
Maybe so.
And given where we are, Frank,
I'm not inclined to follow your suggestions.
Well, I wasn't suggesting it as something you should do.
Just as a possibility.
No, in fact, I don't think you should.
I think it's better to drag these things out as long as possible.
Let the public fatigue on it.
And have it hanging over our heads until the midterms?
It'll lose steam.
What if it doesn't?
I've got the Pentagon proposing tactical drone strikes in the South China Sea.
I can't be dealing with something like this for months on end.
Maybe you're right, then.
A special prosecutor is the way to go.
I didn't say that.
You did.
No, I just meant in terms of getting it off your plate.
It wouldn't be on my plate if you'd kept me better informed.
I have done nothing but try to insulate you, sir.
Is that what you call the feeding frenzy I went through?
I make this solemn promise to you, Mr. President.
I will take the fall if it comes to that, but it won't.
However you decide to deal with this,
I think your instincts are right.
Probably shouldn't involve a special prosecutor.
Send Bill back in.
You knew about this.
Tusk is a client.
Doesn't mean I know everything he...
Bullshit.
The reason you're a partner at Glendon Hill is because you know the things nobody else does.
What do you want me to say?
Is it true?
We don't talk about work.
We're not in bed.
We're in my fucking office.
And in here, you work for Frank.
I work for no one but myself.
Keep telling yourself that
Unlike you, I don't peddle my goods for whoever can pay the highest retainer.
I'm the bitch to a lot of top dogs.
I'm fully aware and willing.
But you're worse.
You're Frank's bitch and refuse to believe it.
That's not true.
Case in fucking point.
Don't turn this.
You knew about the money and you didn't tell me, even though it's thrown my seat into contention.
Let's say there was money.
And let's say I did know.
What good would it have done?
It means you were willing to watch me lose.
It means I respected the boundaries that you demanded.
No changes, no special treatment.
This is different.
So now we're making exceptions?
When it's this important, yes.
You can't have it both ways.
Were you...
Was I what?
Fucking me to get info on Frank.
Is that what you think?
I don't know what to think.
I care about you more than I should.
But I'm getting tired of having to say it.
He's being moved to a federal psychiatric facility for assessment, then a high-security detention center until the official sentencing.
Well, that's good to hear.
The bad news is we don't want you doing any public events for a while.
My bill is about to go to the ﬂoor.
I need to have a public profile.
Your death threats continue to rise.
We can't take the risk.
Am I even allowed to leave the house?
Of course.
But we want you to avoid large crowds.
Our ability to protect...
Mr. Vice President.
Is anything wrong?
We were just briefing Mrs. Underwood on our new security protocol.
Can we actually finish this later?
Of course.
How did it go?
(SIGHS) He's skeptical.
Should I call Tricia?
No.
Could look like I was trying to go behind his back.
We'll just have to wait and see.
I made my case.
And hopefully he'll disagree with it.
This could have been the wrong move.
Well, don't doubt yourself.
Seth has gotten over 3,000 emails in the last six hours.
The phones are overloaded.
So you ignore all that.
I can't ignore the Department of Justice.
What can I do?
Come and visit me when I'm in prison.
You don't have to stand by that door.
Take a load off.
Thank you, sir, but I'm supposed to stay on my feet.
Well, I won't tell if you won't
And if anybody gives you any trouble about this, or anything, they can talk to me.
Beautiful night.
Yes, sir.
It's been strange not having you around these last few days.
You want me to switch back to your detail?
No, no.
I'm glad you're with Claire.
(SIGHS) I just didn't realize how much I got used to your company until you were gone.
Protecting her is the same as protecting you in my mind.
Oh, come on.
Why do you do this?
Do what, sir?
I've always been awestruck.
People who are willing to take a bullet for someone else.
It's how I serve my country.
Well, there's a lot of ways to serve your country.
And this is my way.
Oh, I haven't finished with this one yet.
It's not for you.
I can't drink on duty, ma'am.
It's not for you either.
Well, come on over and join the party.
Haven't you got sick of seeing my face yet?
Never, ma'am.
To Meechum, for his loyalty and service.
To Edward.
I'm on my way to my lawyer's office, Remy.
That's not where I want to be when I'd usually be in bed.
I can't stop Frank from leaking things.
No, but you can make sure he suffers more than us.
And I say us, Remy, because your skin is in this game now, too.
Are you going to deny?
Of course I'm gonna deny.
Every step of this was legal.
They can't prove the links between them.
What about Lanagin?
He'll cooperate.
It's Feng we need to worry about.
I'll find a way to get in touch with him.
We do have one major advantage.
The public can hate me, but as long as Clayton West remains profitable, my stockholders won't care.
Frank doesn't have the same liberty.
Public opinion can demolish him.
You need to make sure that happens.
I could work with the Republicans on that.
They'll be under the magnifying glass, tom.
This'll be a witch hunt.
Then I'll make sure that they pick the right targets.
What you need to do is go after the leadership.
Make them hurt.
They'll turn on Frank to save themselves.
Birch.
Womack.
Sharp.
Especially Jackie Sharp.
She's his chosen one.
Remy?
I heard you, yeah.
I got my marching orders.
I'm counting on you.
I'll deliver.
Let's talk in the morning.
The two names I like the most are
Justin Gaines and Heather Dunbar.
Gaines has better credentials.
But he's close to the administration.
We would've made him a federal judge if the GOP hadn't blocked it.
That's an important point.
Dunbar's got grit.
She's more than qualified.
WALKER:
And there's no baggage there.
But she's more unpredictable.
I doubt the Attorney General would have put her on his list if he thought she was a wild card.
Sir, I have to say, I think this step is premature.
We should hold off and see what the DOJ does on its own.
I don't want to do it, Bill.
But my fear is this, if we wait until the water goes from hot to boiling, we seem reactionary, not proactive.
But proactive could also seem defensive.
Like the suspect that screams
"I didn't do it" before anyone asks.
Aside from that, we simply haven't had time to prepare.
Maybe wait a couple of weeks.
No, that defeats the purpose.
Then a few days.
I'd like to go with Dunbar.
Sir...
I've made my decision.
Bill, I'd like you to convey my wishes to the Attorney General.
Ultimately the decision is his.
We can't appear to be pressuring.
Of course not.
Thank you, sir.
The only thing more satisfying than convincing someone to do what I want is failing to persuade them on purpose.
It's like a "do not enter" sign.
It just begs you to walk through the door.
Doyle's about halfway through our initial background check.
Every donor, every political event.
Anything that Dunbar might be looking into.
Good.
Seth?
We avoid any official statement.
Follow the President's cue.
In the meantime I'd like to make some off-the-record calls.
You welcome the investigation, it's the right step, et cetera.
Give folks the personal touch.
That's fine, as long as we don't come off defensive.
I'd like to see a list of who you'll be calling.
Some of this is gonna be on the fly.
It'd be great if I had a little leeway...
Yeah, let Seth do his thing.
You'll have your hands full with Doyle.
I'll let you know who I call.
All right.
Let's get to work.
Sir?
Yes, what is it?
I understand that you need to delegate.
But when you contradict me in front of Seth, it compromises my authority over him.
You can't micromanage.
We have too much to do.
Seth is still new to the team.
I need to make sure that he's doing his job properly.
Well, I think he is.
I am your failsafe, sir.
But I can't be that if you won't let me.
Are you, Doug?
My failsafe?
Do you doubt that?
We're flying full throttle into a hurricane, and you're talking office politics instead of focusing on making sure we don't get ripped apart.
You're right, sir.
I shouldn't have brought it up.
Is she still there?
Yeah.
I told her I was going for a walk.
Look, Doug, I know you said you wanted her gone, but you have to understand that all I'm asking...
She can stay.
What?
She doesn't have to leave.
She can stay.
I trust you to be smart.
Will you read to me?
My Bible is inside.
Doesn't have to be the Bible.
Just pull up something on your phone.
Like what?
Tale of Two Cities.
My mom used to read it to me.
"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,
"it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness,
"it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity,
"it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness,
"it was the spring of hope, the winter of despair,
"we had everything before us, we had nothing before us,
"we were all going direct to heaven,
"we were all going direct the other way..."
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Doug, is that you?
Hello?
Hello?
Doug... (BEEPING)
Yes, Doug.
It is you.
(LOUD MUSIC PLAYING) Ripped By mstoll
[loud heavy metal plays]
[computer beeping]
Look at that, Cashew.
Someone's being a bad boy.
"Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour, and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice.
And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another."
Do you want me to keep going with this, or something else?
Doesn't matter to me.
I just like hearing you read it.
Doug, there's something I need to talk to you about.
You said that she was just staying for a few nights.
Her roommate kicked her out.
She doesn't have anywhere else to go.
- It's not our problem.
- I can't put her out on the street.
What's her name?
- Lisa.
- Lisa what?
You don't have anything to worry about.
- Where is she now?
- At the fellowship.
There's a sleepover with some of the kids from the day care.
Does she know about me?
No, I haven't told her anything.
I have given you space.
I trusted you, Rachel,
- and you've taken advantage--
- I'm not kicking her out.
[phone beeps]
- I could have said nothing, but I told you.
- I have to go.
She better be gone by the next time we talk.
- Sir.
- What took you so long?
I can have a briefing ready in five minutes.
Don't bother.
I had Seth do it.
He doesn't have security clearance.
Well, he does now.
Mr. President, after you.
I'll see you in my office.
Japanese sovereignty is a matter of precedent.
Mr. Prime Minister, my concern is escalation.
Well, I'm asking for a small portion of the 7th Fleet.
We must bring China into line.
Show them that the US and Japan maintain a strong alliance.
Have you reached out directly to Beijing?
No recognition that the island belongs to Japan.
Well, I'd like to speak to my team and formulate a plan.
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.
Admiral, for those catching up...
Two Chinese destroyers entered waters within three miles of Yonaguni Island here, approximately six hours ago.
See how close the island is to Taiwan.
This is different than the standoff over the Senkaku Islands.
It could have to do with shipping routes.
Or the trade war.
They can't pick on the big kids, so they're picking on the little one.
- Do you see that?
- What?
In the alley, camera two.
All posts, white male, hooded sweatshirt, duffel bag.
Southeast side of Fair St.
[officer over loudspeaker] Put down the bag.
Put down the bag and place your hands on your head.
Stay right where you are.
[siren wails]
Mrs. Underwood?
Will you come downstairs, please?
- Where's Francis?
- He got delayed at the White House, there was an emergency meeting.
- What's going on?
- I'll explain in the safe room.
[Walker] The 7th Fleet is near Guam?
Ninety miles north.
We could have ships to Yonaguni in less than a week.
But even sending them in that direction will be picked up by the Chinese satellites.
Well, we have to stand with our allies, that can't be in question.
What if we don't send ships, just make a strong statement condemning their excursion into Japan's territorial waters.
We still have to offer the Chinese an incentive to call back their destroyers.
Whatever overtures we make, I'd like to have contingency plans in place.
- Already drafting them, sir.
- Cathy, open up a diplomatic channel with Beijing.
See if there's a concrete ask, if they don't have one, let's create a list of options.
- [Cathy] Right away, sir.
- [man] How about coordination with the Japanese navy?
Go.
Don't engage with our navy yet.
I want to talk directly to Prime Minister Oshiro and express our intentions.
Former marine.
He showed up at the outer perimeter with explosives in a duffel bag.
- And strapped to his body.
- Jesus.
We apprehended him, the press isn't aware.
- Well, let's keep it that way.
- He claimed he was responsible for sending the package of white powder to the capitol.
So this time he really wanted to take me out for real.
Not exactly.
His wife got an abortion last week without telling him.
- Oh, my God.
It was me.
- Yes, you were the target.
We'd like to keep you down here with us, Mrs. Underwood,
- until we confirm he was acting alone.
- I'll stay.
No, you have to get back to the White House.
- I can work from here.
- Francis, I'm fine.
Honestly.
I'm just gonna be in here.
I want you to stick with her at all times.
Keep me informed of everything.
He's almost done with his shift, sir.
I can put another agent on--
- No, I want it to be Meechum.
- Absolutely, sir.
As long as necessary.
[Frank] I'll be back as soon as I can.
It's OK.
[Remy] Don't go to California.
[Jackie] Mm...
Be nice to be reelected.
[Remy] You're gonna win.
[Jackie] Not if I don't give the voters more face time.
When did you get it?
- The Army?
- Yeah.
It's grown since then.
Tell me about it.
No.
Why not?
I don't want to.
What are you doing?
Tell me about the tattoo.
[moans]
- That's not fair.
- So what?
You think you can just get me wet and I'll spill everything?
- I don't think so...
- Mm I know so.
[moaning]
Tell me.
I like the pain.
- Of the needle?
- Yeah.
How bad did it hurt?
It hurt a lot.
You like when it hurts?
[gasping]
I killed a lot of people.
What?
In the Army.
The pain it helped.
Finish.
[gasping]
The most I could find was some wrangling with the EPA when he opened his first plant, but that was almost 40 years ago.
- We need more.
I want Tusk gone.
- Doyle and I will keep looking.
If you haven't found anything now, what makes you think you will?
Maybe we missed something.
I doubt it, but we could try.
You think Tusk isn't planning his next attack even as we speak?
[Doug] We've been thorough, sir.
He doesn't leave footprints.
You want to shift tactics?
The casino.
We go public as soon as possible.
You said that was a last resort.
Seth, you need to find a way to make that happen so it doesn't link to us.
[Doug] If we launch that missile, it could blow us up too.
[Seth] Not if we spin it right.
- If we keep the focus on--
- Seth.
You're here to listen, not contribute.
I wouldn't have him here if I didn't want him to contribute.
Sir... he's been sitting with this for three hours.
I've been working on it for three months.
And accomplished nothing.
It's time we go on the offensive.
- What do you think?
- [Seth] Ayla Sayyad.
- She's already digging into Tusk and Feng.
- How close is she?
She never mentioned a casino, but now that I know what the dots are,
I can see that she's starting to connect them.
[Ayla] The Pentagon isn't talking yet.
I imagine they're waiting on the White House.
I hear there have been regular meetings in the Situation Room since last night.
Let me call you right back.
- [woman] Hello?
- Hey, Lynne, it's Ayla.
- I just sent you a picture.
- Yeah, I got it.
- What does it mean?
- It's strange, it doesn't make sense.
- Tell me.
- "Pursue currency" would be the most literal translation.
Or "pursue money."
- Follow the money?
- That could work.
Thanks, Lynne.
I like what you've done.
This sofa, it's new?
- These lamps as well?
- I've made a few changes.
You get so used to a place, the smallest things stand out.
I apologize for not being responsive sooner.
I've been focused on the midterms.
Oh, there's no need to explain.
Mrs. Underwood, you know how much I respect your intentions, but I've thought deeply about this and
I can't cosponsor the bill in its current form.
Civilian oversight is too extreme a step, but I'd be happy to revisit some of the other less extreme proposals.
You think we're being extremist?
I want to help with this issue, but this bill goes through--
This bill is through Armed Services.
This bill has a date on the floor.
Almost every woman in the House supports this bill.
- And I can't be one of them.
- So you lied to us.
I didn't lie.
I didn't lie.
I...
I want to help.
As long as we rethink some of the language.
Are you trying to distance yourself from us because of the Galloway scandal?
- No.
- Maybe you think it hurts your chances
- of reelection if you associate with me.
- That's not it.
It's because I honestly don't believe in this approach.
Do you realize the message this sends?
The only woman in congressional leadership in both parties, and you bow out?
If the bill goes to the floor as is, I won't just bow out.
I'll actively fight it.
You never asked my position.
You assumed.
I can't imagine what that position must be.
I've served in war zones, I know firsthand how important--
We're not talking about war zones.
We're talking about sexual assault.
How about a military commission to review the internal--
We don't need more studies, we need reform.
Well, let's continue this conversation when I return from California.
I'll be back the day after tomorrow if you change your mind.
I won't, but I hope you change yours.
[Cathy] China was insulted at the notion that we could buy them off.
[Walker] Do I need to call President Qian?
I doubt he would contradict one of his ministers.
See if he's willing to talk one-on-one.
You should know, sir, Japan is also preparing to deploy three destroyers and a light cruiser.
They're upping the ante.
Have Ambassador Hines get in touch with the prime minister, and ask if Japan will hold off until I make contact with Beijing.
Yes, sir.
Have you gotten any rest at all?
- No, have you?
- No, not yet.
How's Claire?
Secret Service thinks it's an isolated attempt, but they're being cautious.
After the Galloway thing and the interview, half the country thinks she's a baby killer, or an adulterer, or both.
But Claire's taking it in stride.
We're in good hands.
That's very frightening.
I can see why you haven't slept.
One of us should, probably the one that's calling all the shots.
No, I can hold out a little while longer.
No, go to the residence, spend some time with your wife.
You'll come back feeling like a new man.
Honestly, it's less stressful here.
- Counseling hasn't helped?
- No, it has... slowly.
- I got rid of Christina when Linda resigned.
- I heard.
It's improved things some, but... [sighs] ...there's still work to do.
Makes me tired just to think about it.
Well, you probably wouldn't be the first president to get a little shut-eye on one of these sofas.
- I was joking.
- I wasn't.
Do the free world a favor and get some rest.
- I'll let you be.
- No, stick around.
You should be nearby if President Qian wants to get on the phone.
I've always loathed the necessity of sleep.
Like death, it puts the most powerful men on their backs.
[phone ringing] [man] DC Limo and Bus Rental.
I'm calling from the Adohi Casino's travel department.
We've got a corporate account.
[man] Let's see...
I'm sorry, we don't have one in our records.
My mistake.
I must've called the wrong limo service.
Thank you.
[dialing, line ringing] [woman] Missouri Bus and Limo.
I'm calling from the Adohi Casino's travel department.
- You're not Darlene.
- No, Darlene is out sick.
I'm filling in for her.
My name is Pam.
How can I help you, Pam?
We've got a flight coming in from China tomorrow.
We'll need some transportation.
How many you got coming?
I don't have the manifest right in front of me.
- The usual?
- That's right.
- So a luxury bus.
- How many does that fit?
Fifty-five, usually about 20 come in.
Should be plenty of room.
That's great, thanks.
[Frank] Do you think it's really her conscience, or because the bill's controversial?
I don't think she would have threatened to fight us if all she wanted to do was avoid controversy.
I'll talk to her.
I really want this bill to pass.
I know you do, so do I.
We need Jackie more than ever, Francis.
I'm damaged goods, this whole Adam thing.
No, you're not.
We fought past that.
Well, there's plenty of people who still believe it's true.
We'll get it passed, I promise.
- No, thanks.
- Come on.
It's no fun doing it alone.
We could just go for a run.
No more runs until the death threats die down, that's the new rule.
But they let you go to the office.
Because I was in a bulletproof car.
Does this mean we've officially not quit?
We've never been quitters, have we?
Sir, Mrs. Underwood, sorry to interrupt.
I was gonna head home, but I'll stick around if you want me to.
Oh, no.
You've been up long enough.
Get some sleep.
[Meechum] I'll be back first thing in the morning.
Thank you for looking after me today.
My pleasure, ma'am.
Sir, Mrs. Underwood.
- He's very dedicated.
- He is.
It's rare to find someone like Edward.
- What?
- You never use his first name.
Oh, did I?
I don't feel right talking about her like this.
It's just... technically, she's my boss now.
- There's a certain protocol.
- [Seth] This is coming directly from Doug.
Which means it's coming directly from the vice president.
Well, um, I have seen Mr. Danton around from time to time.
Do you know what he and the congresswoman were discussing?
No, they were private meetings.
Do you have the appointment schedule?
I'd like to look at the dates.
These weren't formal appointments.
He just stops by.
Most of the time pretty late at night.
[Ayla] Did the money originate in China?
[Lanagin] The money came from tribal revenue.
As our FEC reports clearly stated.
[Ayla] Let me rephrase.
Did any of that revenue come from Chinese visitors who gambled at your casino?
[Lanagin] We have visitors from all over the world.
I'm speaking specifically about a businessman named Xander Feng.
I have no idea who that is.
[Ayla] I'm looking at FAA flight records that show a private plane he owns making numerous trips to Kansas City.
And I spoke with Missouri Bus and Limo, which has transported Chinese visitors to your casino.
- [Lanagin] Ms. Said--
- Sayyad.
Ms. Sayyad, the only reason I returned your call was because you work for The Telegraph.
It's not every day that I get a call from a paper as big as yours.
But I don't know what you're trying to get at here, so if you'll excuse--
What about Raymond Tusk?
- What about him?
- Feng has ties to Tusk.
Tusk has ties to the president.
You have ties to Feng.
That looks like foreign money being used to influence political--
What you're insinuating is not only wrong,
- it's libelous.
- Not if it's true.
I won't bat an eyelash getting my attorneys involved.
[Ayla] Tusk made the same threat.
If a man worth 40 billion dollars doesn't intimidate me, you certainly don't, Mr. Lana--
Hello?
He hung up.
[Frank] I had nothing to do with it, Raymond.
I can smell the horseshit through the phone.
[Frank] You think I'd put myself at this great a risk?
Desperate men are capable of anything.
- I want it to go away, just like you do.
- Then pull her back.
I have no control over the press, Raymond.
[Raymond] You'll destroy yourself, Frank, not me.
Thank you for that unsolicited advice.
Work with Doyle, make sure we have no weak spots.
- I'll call him now.
- What did Nancy say?
Well, it looks like Jackie may be sleeping with the enemy.
Lanagin is correct in saying we run the risk of libel.
These links are supported by fact.
Individually, but you can't complete the circle.
[Ayla] I'm not saying the headline should read:
Money Laundering Scheme Exposed!
Just that we present the landscape as we currently know it.
We're first and foremost a financial paper.
Many of our readers worship Raymond Tusk.
So we just protect him?
We don't insinuate connections we can't back up.
If there's any basis for litigation, you can be sure his team will be aggressive.
[man] They've bankrupted papers before.
I think you should slow down and take your time.
When, and if, you have a story--
Mr. Maxfield, Raymond Tusk is on the line.
- Did you put in a call to him?
- Yesterday.
[woman] He's specifically asking for you, sir.
We got off the phone with Lanagin less than 30 minutes ago.
That means Tusk was the first call Lanagin made.
Tell him I'll return.
Did you reach out to the White House?
They're not talking to anyone until after the president does his press briefing tomorrow.
All right, walk me through all of this again, point by point.
[knocking on door]
- Meechum.
- We can talk tomorrow, sir.
No.
What is it?
I'd like to put in a request to be on your wife's detail full time.
At least until the death threats quiet down.
That's very thoughtful.
I'll only do it if you approve, sir.
- Have you spoken to Claire?
- When she came home.
- She likes the idea.
- Then I think we should do it.
I'll let Agent Rockland know.
Sorry for interrupting you, sir.
You didn't interrupt anything.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Meechum.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You'll never believe what just happened.
- What?
- Meechum came into the office and found me watching something...
- ...other than the news.
- Oh!
[laughs]
- Oh, no.
- He was very professional about it.
- Were you...?
- No, no.
I was just watching.
That's really funny.
What about you?
What are you watching?
The video Connor gave me.
It's our first state senate race.
I forgot about that.
So did I, until I found it in the desk this morning.
Let me see.
[Frank on computer] ...been there, like I have.
Of course, it doesn't hurt to have a little Texas in them...
My God, look how young we are.
I know.
[Claire] Everyone here has been so kind, and so welcoming.
[Frank] We'll have her rooting for Clemson before too long.
[Claire] That's where I have to draw the line.
Do you miss being with Adam?
Where did that come from?
Miss it?
No.
Well, you must, sometimes.
He meant a lot to me for a while.
But that's done now.
What about you?
What about me?
Are you unsatisfied?
There's just too much at stake now.
No one we can trust.
We don't have the freedom we once did.
Maybe it's better this way.
No room for distractions.
I don't mind the sacrifice.
We chose this instead.
[Frank] I think the one thing we can agree on is the ribs here are better.
[Claire] See, he's just trying to get under my skin.
[Frank] No, it's not even debatable...
- [Frank] How was California?
- Oh... [laughs]
Exhausting.
Twelve events in two days.
- Is this the Golden Gate?
- Yes.
I had an etching right there.
The capitol before it was finished.
Took 85 years to complete it.
- How long did it take to complete the bridge?
- About four years.
It opened a few months after FDR's second inaugural.
There was a man who got things done.
Strong beliefs and he stuck to them.
But compromised when he had to.
I assume you're here to talk about Claire's bill.
It's not a pet project.
There are three dozen cosponsors on either side of the aisle.
- It's a serious bill.
- I don't disagree.
- Except with the language.
- I can explain my thinking, but I doubt I'll convince you anymore--
Putting aside the military's honor, chain of command, all the things that you hold dear let's consider one simple fact.
You wouldn't have this office if it weren't for me.
I made very clear that I wouldn't be a puppet.
I'm not trying to pull strings, but you could show a little gratitude.
If it were anything else, Mr. Vice President... but not this.
All you're doing is making the inevitable more difficult.
It's not inevitable.
Claire doesn't have the votes yet.
You really want to fight us on this.
I don't want to fight you at all.
Which is why I suggested to Claire that we sit down--
I neither have the time nor the inclination to negotiate with you!
Cosponsor the bill, whip the damn votes, I'm no longer asking.
Then I'm no longer listening.
You don't have just this office to thank me for.
If you win reelection, you can thank me for that, too.
Those attack ads didn't just disappear on their own.
- What do you mean?
- Why don't you ask Remy Danton.
And ask him about Raymond Tusk while you're at it.
That ought to make for some very interesting pillow talk.
You keep up the good work, Nancy.
I will, Mr. Vice President.
I miss having you around, but you're my eyes and ears now, otherwise I'd steal you back in a heartbeat.
Well, thank you, sir.
It means a lot to me that you say that.
- Doug?
- I'm busy.
The story just broke.
They timed it with the president's press conference.
Connect me with the vice president.
[Walker] So the 7th Fleet is currently positioned near Guam, where it will remain if China removes its ships from Japan's sovereign waters.
I've been in frequent touch with prime minister Oshiro, and have made personal overtures to President Qian.
And I remain optimistic that tensions will be quelled without any further escalations.
So, with that, I'll take some questions.
- Henry, you first.
- [man] Can you comment on the Wall Street Telegraph article--
I was just notified of that moments before I joined you.
I haven't had a chance to read it yet.
Yeah, Jane.
[woman] Mr. President, would you walk us through your history with Raymond Tusk?
I'm here to answer questions on Sino-Japanese relations.
Mark.
[man] The article mentions Xander Feng, a wealthy and influential Chinese business--
Unless this has to do with the statement I just made-- [man] It does, Mr. President.
Feng has ties to the standing committee and we're currently in a standoff with the Chinese.
Economically--
Thank you all very much.
It's not beginning the story that I fear, it's not knowing how it will end.
Everyone is fair game now, including me.
This is par for the course, what we've come to expect from President Walker.
Whenever he's selling a shiny new car, he can't say enough about it.
The engine breaks down, the transmission gives out, he dodges, he ignores the warranty.
I'm gonna tell you something, our warranty is the Constitution of the United States, and there's no limit on that.
He needs to read the fine print and start answering our questions.
If any of this is true, we're talking Congress, the White House, both parties...
Now, I'm saying "if,"
but when it looks like dirty money, and it smells like dirty money, somebody has probably got dirt under their nails.
Look, there's no real proof this money laundering is even--
The connections are troubling, especially Underwood.
He was the House whip the entire time Adohi were contributing to the Democrats, and he's working side by side with the president now.
The president.
So this goes all the way to the White House?
- It might.
- It's hypothetical.
And by the way, you've cherry-picked the facts to make your case.
I'm not making a case.
My headline is:
PAC Money Raises Questions.
And it has.
I haven't answered those questions, but I think the American people deserve answers.
Don't you?
You can bet your bottom dollar the attorney general is gonna investigate.
- With the firestorm this is causing in the media--
- What's our course of action?
As your counsel, I would encourage you not to speak to the press until we have more information.
As your average citizen, the longer you wait, the more suspicious it looks.
If there's been any irregularity, I had nothing to do with it.
Your friendship with Tusk implies guilt by association.
Are we presuming guilt before innocence?
I'm a lawyer, I presume nothing.
But public opinion doesn't have a law degree.
Give us a few moments.
I have to advise you not to have any conversation about this matter
- without me present.
- Your advisement has been noted.
I'll be right outside.
Is this what you were keeping from me?
We should follow your counsel's advice
- and not--
- Tell me if it's true, about the money.
With Bill out of the room, we open ourselves up to--
Damn it, Frank!
I've been in the dark too long on this.
That ends now.
I don't know any details.
Feng told me if the Bridge project got approved, the GOP would stop getting money.
We approved it, the money stopped.
Jesus Christ, that connects the White House directly to the money.
No, sir.
You knew nothing, you still know nothing.
If the DOJ finds any concrete evidence of foreign money--
That's Raymond Tusk's head, not yours.
You've done nothing wrong.
Guilt by association, Frank.
You heard the man.
If the DOJ investigates, it will only prove your innocence.
Nobody walks away from something like this without bruises.
Well, bruises you can survive.
I just don't know how we can avoid it at this point.
Unless you want to accelerate the process and get rid of it.
We could always have the attorney general appoint a special prosecutor.
- That's a terrible idea.
- Maybe so.
And given where we are, Frank, I'm not inclined to follow your suggestions.
Well, I wasn't suggesting it was something you should do.
Just as a possibility.
No, in fact, I don't think you should.
I think it's better to drag these things out as long as possible.
- Let the public fatigue on it.
- And have it hanging over our heads until the midterms?
- It'll lose steam.
- What if it doesn't.
I've got the Pentagon proposing tactical drone strikes in the South China Sea.
I can't be dealing with something like this for months on end.
Maybe you're right then.
A special prosecutor is the way to go.
I didn't say that, you did.
Oh, no.
I just meant in terms of getting it off your plate.
It wouldn't be on my plate if you kept me better informed.
I have done nothing but try to insulate you, sir.
Is that what you call the feeding frenzy I just went through?
I make this solemn promise to you, Mr. President.
I will take the fall if it comes to that, but it won't.
However you decide to deal with this, I think your instincts are right.
We probably shouldn't involve a special prosecutor.
Send Bill back in.
You knew about this.
Tusk is a client, doesn't mean I know everything--
Bullshit.
The reason you're a partner at Glendon Hill is because you know the things nobody else does.
What do you want me to say?
- Is it true?
- We don't talk about work.
We're not in bed, we're in my fucking office.
And in here, you work for Frank.
- I work for no one but myself.
- Keep telling yourself that.
Unlike you, I don't peddle my goods for whoever can pay the highest retainer.
I'm the bitch to a lot of top dogs, I'm fully aware and willing, but you're worse.
You're Frank's bitch and refuse to believe it.
- That's not true.
- Case in fucking point.
Don't turn this.
You knew about the money and you didn't tell me.
Even though it's thrown my seat into contention.
Let's say there was money, and let's say I did know,
- what good would it have done?
- It means you were willing to watch me lose!
It means I respected the boundaries that you demanded.
- No changes, no special treatment.
- This is different!
- So now we're making exceptions?
- When it's this important, yes!
You can't have it both ways.
Were you...?
Was I what?
...fucking me to get info on Frank?
- Is that what you think?
- I don't know what to think.
I care about you more than I should.
But I'm getting tired of having to say it.
He's being moved to a federal psychiatric facility for assessment.
Then a high security detention center until the official sentencing.
Well, that's good to hear.
The bad news is we don't want you doing any public events for a while.
My bill's about to go to the floor.
I need to have a public profile.
Your death threats continue to rise.
We can't take the risk.
- Am I even allowed to leave the house?
- Of course.
But we want you to avoid large crowds.
Our ability to protect-- Mr. Vice President.
- Anything wrong?
- We were just briefing Mrs. Underwood on her new security protocol.
- Can we actually finish this later?
- Of course.
How did it go?
- He's skeptical.
- Should I call Tricia?
No.
It could look like I was trying to go behind his back.
We'll just have to wait and see.
I made my case.
Hopefully, he'll disagree with it.
But this could've been the wrong move.
Well, don't doubt yourself.
Seth has gotten over 3,000 e-mails in the last six hours.
- The phones are overloaded.
- So you ignore all that?
I can't ignore the Department of Justice.
What can I do?
Come and visit me when I'm in prison.
You don't have to stand by that door.
Take a load off.
Thank you, sir, but I'm supposed to stay on my feet.
Well, I won't tell if you won't.
And if anybody gives you any trouble about this, or anything, they can talk to me.
- Beautiful night.
- Yes, sir.
It's been strange not having you around these last few days.
You want me to switch back to your detail?
No, no.
I'm glad you're with Claire.
I just didn't realize how much I got used to your company until you were gone.
Protecting her is the same as protecting you, in my mind.
Oh, come on.
- Why do you do this?
- Do what, sir?
I've always been awestruck, people who are willing to take a bullet for someone else.
- That's how I serve my country.
- Well, there's a lot of ways to serve your country.
And this is my way.
- I haven't finished with this one yet.
- It's not for you.
I can't drink on duty, ma'am.
It's not for you either.
[chuckles] Well, come on over and join the party.
Haven't you got sick of seeing my face yet?
Never, ma'am.
To Meechum, for his loyalty and service.
To Edward.
[Raymond] I'm on my way to my lawyer's office, Remy.
That's not where I want to be when I'd usually be in bed.
I can't stop Frank from leaking things.
No, but you can make sure he suffers more than us.
And I say "us," Remy, because your skin is in this game now, too.
- Are you gonna deny?
- Of course I'm gonna deny.
Every step of this was legal.
They can't prove the links between them.
- What about Lanagin?
- He'll cooperate.
It's Feng we need to worry about.
I'll find a way to get in touch with him.
We do have one major advantage.
The public can hate me, but as long as Clayton West remains profitable, my stockholders won't care.
Frank doesn't have the same liberty.
Public opinion can demolish him.
You need to make sure that happens.
I can work with the Republicans on that.
Well, we'll be under the magnifying glass too.
This will be a witch hunt.
I'll make sure that they pick the right targets.
What you need to do is go after the leadership.
Make them hurt.
They'll turn on Frank to save themselves.
Birch, Womack, Sharp.
Especially Jackie Sharp.
She's his chosen one.
- Remy?
- I heard you.
I got my marching orders.
- I'm counting on you.
- I'll deliver.
Let's talk in the morning.
The two names I like the most are Justin Gaines and Heather Dunbar.
Gaines has better credentials.
But he's close to the administration.
I would've made him a federal judge if the GOP hadn't blocked it.
That's an important point.
Dunbar's got grit.
- She's more than qualified.
- No baggage there?
- She's more unpredictable.
- I doubt the attorney general would've put her on his list if he thought she was a wild card.
Sir, I have to say, I think this step is premature.
We should hold off and see what the DOJ does on its own.
I don't want to do it, Bill, but my fear is this:
if we wait until the water goes from hot to boiling, we seem reactionary, not proactive.
But proactive could also seem defensive.
Like the suspect that screams "I didn't do it" before anyone asks.
Aside from that, we simply haven't had time to prepare.
- Maybe wait a couple of weeks.
- That defeats the purpose.
- Then a few days.
- I'd like to go with Dunbar.
- Sir--
- I've made my decision.
Bill, I'd like you to convey my wishes to the attorney general.
Ultimately, the decision is his.
We can't appear to be pressuring him.
- Of course not.
- Thank you, sir.
The only thing more satisfying than convincing someone to do what I want, is failing to persuade them on purpose.
It's like a "Do Not Enter" sign, it just begs you to walk through the door.
[Doug] Doyle's about halfway through our initial background check.
Every donor, every political event.
Everything that Dunbar might be looking into.
- Good.
Seth?
- We avoid any official statement, follow the president's cue.
In the meantime, I'd like to make some off the record calls.
You welcome the investigation, it's the right step, et cetera.
Give folks the personal touch.
That's fine, as long as we don't come off defensive.
I'd like to see a list of who you'd be calling.
Some of this is gonna be on the fly, it'd be great if I had a little leeway.
Let Seth do his thing, you'll have your hands full with Doyle.
I'll let you know who I've called.
All right, let's get to work.
Sir?
Yes, what is it?
I understand that you need to delegate, but when you contradict me in front of Seth, it compromises my authority over him.
You can't micromanage, we have too much to do.
Seth is still new to the team.
I need to make sure that he's doing his job properly.
- Well, I think he is.
- I'm your fail-safe, sir.
But I can't be that if you won't let me.
Are you, Doug?
- My failsafe?
- Do you doubt that?
We're flying full throttle into a hurricane, and you're talking office politics instead of focusing on making sure we don't get ripped apart.
You're right, sir.
I shouldn't have brought it up.
- Is she still there?
- Yeah.
I told her I was going for a walk.
Look, Doug, I know you said you wanted her gone, but you have to understand--
She can stay.
- What?
- She doesn't have to leave, she can stay.
I trust you to be smart.
Will you read to me?
- My Bible's inside.
- Doesn't have to be the Bible.
Just pull up something on your phone.
- Like what?
- A Tale of Two Cities.
My mom used to read it to me.
"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom,
it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope,
it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way."
Hello?
Doug, is that you?
Hello?
Hello?
Doug?
[beeping]
Yes, Doug, it is you.
[heavy metal plays]
{\move(10,10,190,230,100,400)\fad(0,1000)\fscx25\fscy25\t(0,6000,\fscx125\fscy125)\cH000000\3cH00FFFF}anoXmous
Look at that, Cashew.
Someone's being a bad boy.
"Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour, and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice.
And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another."
Do you want me to keep going with this, or something else?
Doesn't matter to me.
I just like hearing you read it.
Doug, there's something I need to talk to you about.
You said that she was just staying for a few nights.
Her roommate kicked her out.
She doesn't have anywhere else to go.
- It's not our problem.
- I can't put her out on the street.
What's her name?
- Lisa.
- Lisa what?
You don't have anything to worry about.
- Where is she now?
- At the fellowship.
There's a sleepover with some of the kids from the day care.
Does she know about me?
No, I haven't told her anything.
I have given you space.
I trusted you, Rachel,
- and you've taken advantage...
- I'm not kicking her out.
- I could have said nothing, but I told you.
- I have to go.
She better be gone by the next time we talk.
- Sir.
- What took you so long?
I can have a briefing ready in five minutes.
Don't bother.
I had Seth do it.
He doesn't have security clearance.
Well, he does now.
Mr. President, after you.
I'll see you in my office.
Japanese sovereignty is a matter of precedent.
Mr. Prime Minister, my concern is escalation.
Well, I'm asking for a small portion of the 7th Fleet.
We must bring China into line.
Show them that the US and Japan maintain a strong alliance.
Have you reached out directly to Beijing?
No recognition that the island belongs to Japan.
Well, I'd like to speak to my team and formulate a plan.
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.
Admiral, for those catching up...
Two Chinese destroyers entered waters within three miles of Yonaguni Island here, approximately six hours ago.
See how close the island is to Taiwan.
This is different than the standoff over the Senkaku Islands.
It could have to do with shipping routes.
Or the trade war.
They can't pick on the big kids, so they're picking on the little one.
- Do you see that?
- What?
In the alley, camera two.
All posts, white male, hooded sweatshirt, duffel bag.
Southeast side of Fair St.
Put down the bag.
Put down the bag and place your hands on your head.
Stay right where you are.
Mrs. Underwood?
Will you come downstairs, please?
- Where's Francis?
- He got delayed at the White House, there was an emergency meeting.
- What's going on?
- I'll explain in the safe room.
The 7th Fleet is near Guam?
Ninety miles north.
We could have ships to Yonaguni in less than a week.
But even sending them in that direction will be picked up by the Chinese satellites.
Well, we have to stand with our allies, that can't be in question.
What if we don't send ships, just make a strong statement condemning their excursion into Japan's territorial waters.
We still have to offer the Chinese an incentive to call back their destroyers.
Whatever overtures we make, I'd like to have contingency plans in place.
- Already drafting them, sir.
- Cathy, open up a diplomatic channel with Beijing.
See if there's a concrete ask, if they don't have one, let's create a list of options.
- Right away, sir.
- How about coordination with the Japanese navy?
Go.
Don't engage with our navy yet.
I want to talk directly to Prime Minister Oshiro and express our intentions.
Former marine.
He showed up at the outer perimeter with explosives in a duffel bag.
- And strapped to his body.
- Jesus.
We apprehended him, the press isn't aware.
- Well, let's keep it that way.
- He claimed he was responsible for sending the package of white powder to the capitol.
So this time he really wanted to take me out for real.
Not exactly.
His wife got an abortion last week without telling him.
- Oh, my God.
It was me.
- Yes, you were the target.
We'd like to keep you down here with us, Mrs. Underwood,
- until we confirm he was acting alone.
- I'll stay.
No, you have to get back to the White House.
- I can work from here.
- Francis, I'm fine.
Honestly.
I'm just gonna be in here.
I want you to stick with her at all times.
Keep me informed of everything.
He's almost done with his shift, sir.
I can put another agent on...
- No, I want it to be Meechum.
- Absolutely, sir.
As long as necessary.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
It's OK.
Don't go to California.
Mm...
Be nice to be reelected.
You're gonna win.
Not if I don't give the voters more face time.
When did you get it?
- The Army?
- Yeah.
It's grown since then.
Tell me about it.
No.
Why not?
I don't want to.
What are you doing?
Tell me about the tattoo.
- That's not fair.
- So what?
You think you can just get me wet and I'll spill everything?
- I don't think so...
- Mm I know so.
Tell me.
I like the pain.
- Of the needle?
- Yeah.
How bad did it hurt?
It hurt a lot.
You like when it hurts?
I killed a lot of people.
What?
In the Army.
The pain it helped.
Finish.
The most I could find was some wrangling with the EPA when he opened his first plant, but that was almost 40 years ago.
- We need more.
I want Tusk gone.
- Doyle and I will keep looking.
If you haven't found anything now, what makes you think you will?
Maybe we missed something.
I doubt it, but we could try.
You think Tusk isn't planning his next attack even as we speak?
We've been thorough, sir.
He doesn't leave footprints.
You want to shift tactics?
The casino.
We go public as soon as possible.
You said that was a last resort.
Seth, you need to find a way to make that happen so it doesn't link to us.
If we launch that missile, it could blow us up too.
Not if we spin it right.
- If we keep the focus on...
- Seth.
You're here to listen, not contribute.
I wouldn't have him here if I didn't want him to contribute.
Sir... he's been sitting with this for three hours.
I've been working on it for three months.
And accomplished nothing.
It's time we go on the offensive.
- What do you think?
- Ayla Sayyad.
- She's already digging into Tusk and Feng.
- How close is she?
She never mentioned a casino, but now that I know what the dots are,
I can see that she's starting to connect them.
The Pentagon isn't talking yet.
I imagine they're waiting on the White House.
I hear there have been regular meetings in the Situation Room since last night.
Let me call you right back.
- Hello?
- Hey, Lynne, it's Ayla.
- I just sent you a picture.
- Yeah, I got it.
- What does it mean?
- It's strange, it doesn't make sense.
- Tell me. - "Pursue currency" would be the most literal translation.
Or "pursue money."
- Follow the money?
- That could work.
Thanks, Lynne.
I like what you've done.
This sofa, it's new?
- These lamps as well?
- I've made a few changes.
You get so used to a place, the smallest things stand out.
I apologize for not being responsive sooner.
I've been focused on the midterms.
Oh, there's no need to explain.
Mrs. Underwood, you know how much I respect your intentions, but I've thought deeply about this and
I can't cosponsor the bill in its current form.
Civilian oversight is too extreme a step, but I'd be happy to revisit some of the other less extreme proposals.
You think we're being extremist?
I want to help with this issue, but this bill goes through...
This bill is through Armed Services.
This bill has a date on the floor.
Almost every woman in the House supports this bill.
- And I can't be one of them.
- So you lied to us.
I didn't lie.
I didn't lie.
I...
I want to help.
As long as we rethink some of the language.
Are you trying to distance yourself from us because of the Galloway scandal?
- No.
- Maybe you think it hurts your chances
- of reelection if you associate with me.
- That's not it.
It's because I honestly don't believe in this approach.
Do you realize the message this sends?
The only woman in congressional leadership in both parties, and you bow out?
If the bill goes to the floor as is, I won't just bow out.
I'll actively fight it.
You never asked my position.
You assumed.
I can't imagine what that position must be.
I've served in war zones, I know firsthand how important...
We're not talking about war zones.
We're talking about sexual assault.
How about a military commission to review the internal...
We don't need more studies, we need reform.
Well, let's continue this conversation when I return from California.
I'll be back the day after tomorrow if you change your mind.
I won't, but I hope you change yours.
China was insulted at the notion that we could buy them off.
Do I need to call President Qian?
I doubt he would contradict one of his ministers.
See if he's willing to talk one-on-one.
You should know, sir, Japan is also preparing to deploy three destroyers and a light cruiser.
They're upping the ante.
Have Ambassador Hines get in touch with the prime minister, and ask if Japan will hold off until I make contact with Beijing.
Yes, sir.
Have you gotten any rest at all?
- No, have you?
- No, not yet.
How's Claire?
Secret Service thinks it's an isolated attempt, but they're being cautious.
After the Galloway thing and the interview, half the country thinks she's a baby killer, or an adulterer, or both.
But Claire's taking it in stride.
We're in good hands.
That's very frightening.
I can see why you haven't slept.
One of us should, probably the one that's calling all the shots.
No, I can hold out a little while longer.
No, go to the residence, spend some time with your wife.
You'll come back feeling like a new man.
Honestly, it's less stressful here.
- Counseling hasn't helped?
- No, it has... slowly.
- I got rid of Christina when Linda resigned.
- I heard.
It's improved things some, but there's still work to do.
Makes me tired just to think about it.
Well, you probably wouldn't be the first president to get a little shut-eye on one of these sofas.
- I was joking.
- I wasn't.
Do the free world a favor and get some rest.
- I'll let you be.
- No, stick around.
You should be nearby if President Qian wants to get on the phone.
I've always loathed the necessity of sleep.
Like death, it puts the most powerful men on their backs.
DC Limo and Bus Rental.
I'm calling from the Adohi Casino's travel department.
We've got a corporate account.
Let's see...
I'm sorry, we don't have one in our records.
My mistake.
I must've called the wrong limo service.
Thank you.
Missouri Bus and Limo.
I'm calling from the Adohi Casino's travel department.
- You're not Darlene.
- No, Darlene is out sick.
I'm filling in for her.
My name is Pam.
How can I help you, Pam?
We've got a flight coming in from China tomorrow.
We'll need some transportation.
How many you got coming?
I don't have the manifest right in front of me.
- The usual?
- That's right.
- So a luxury bus.
- How many does that fit?
Fifty-five, usually about 20 come in.
Should be plenty of room.
That's great, thanks.
Do you think it's really her conscience, or because the bill's controversial?
I don't think she would have threatened to fight us if all she wanted to do was avoid controversy.
I'll talk to her.
I really want this bill to pass.
I know you do, so do I.
We need Jackie more than ever, Francis.
I'm damaged goods, this whole Adam thing.
No, you're not.
We fought past that.
Well, there's plenty of people who still believe it's true.
We'll get it passed, I promise.
- No, thanks.
- Come on.
It's no fun doing it alone.
We could just go for a run.
No more runs until the death threats die down, that's the new rule.
But they let you go to the office.
Because I was in a bulletproof car.
Does this mean we've officially not quit?
We've never been quitters, have we?
Sir, Mrs. Underwood, sorry to interrupt.
I was gonna head home, but I'll stick around if you want me to.
Oh, no.
You've been up long enough.
Get some sleep.
I'll be back first thing in the morning.
Thank you for looking after me today.
My pleasure, ma'am.
Sir, Mrs. Underwood.
- He's very dedicated.
- He is.
It's rare to find someone like Edward.
- What?
- You never use his first name.
Oh, did I?
I don't feel right talking about her like this.
It's just... technically, she's my boss now.
- There's a certain protocol.
- This is coming directly from Doug.
Which means it's coming directly from the vice president.
Well, um, I have seen Mr. Danton around from time to time.
Do you know what he and the congresswoman were discussing?
No, they were private meetings.
Do you have the appointment schedule?
I'd like to look at the dates.
These weren't formal appointments.
He just stops by.
Most of the time pretty late at night.
Did the money originate in China?
The money came from tribal revenue.
As our FEC reports clearly stated.
Let me rephrase.
Did any of that revenue come from Chinese visitors who gambled at your casino?
We have visitors from all over the world.
I'm speaking specifically about a businessman named Xander Feng.
I have no idea who that is.
I'm looking at FAA flight records that show a private plane he owns making numerous trips to Kansas City.
And I spoke with Missouri Bus and Limo, which has transported Chinese visitors to your casino.
- Ms. Said...
- Sayyad.
Ms. Sayyad, the only reason I returned your call was because you work for The Telegraph.
It's not every day that I get a call from a paper as big as yours.
But I don't know what you're trying to get at here, so if you'll excuse...
What about Raymond Tusk?
- What about him?
- Feng has ties to Tusk.
Tusk has ties to the president.
You have ties to Feng.
That looks like foreign money being used to influence political...
What you're insinuating is not only wrong,
- it's libelous.
- Not if it's true.
I won't bat an eyelash getting my attorneys involved.
Tusk made the same threat.
If a man worth 40 billion dollars doesn't intimidate me, you certainly don't, Mr. Lana...
Hello?
He hung up.
I had nothing to do with it, Raymond.
I can smell the horseshit through the phone.
You think I'd put myself at this great a risk?
Desperate men are capable of anything.
- I want it to go away, just like you do.
- Then pull her back.
I have no control over the press, Raymond.
You'll destroy yourself, Frank, not me.
Thank you for that unsolicited advice.
Work with Doyle, make sure we have no weak spots.
- I'll call him now.
- What did Nancy say?
Well, it looks like Jackie may be sleeping with the enemy.
Lanagin is correct in saying we run the risk of libel.
These links are supported by fact.
Individually, but you can't complete the circle.
I'm not saying the headline should read:
Money Laundering Scheme Exposed!
Just that we present the landscape as we currently know it.
We're first and foremost a financial paper.
Many of our readers worship Raymond Tusk.
So we just protect him?
We don't insinuate connections we can't back up.
If there's any basis for litigation, you can be sure his team will be aggressive.
They've bankrupted papers before.
I think you should slow down and take your time.
When, and if, you have a story...
Mr. Maxfield, Raymond Tusk is on the line.
- Did you put in a call to him?
- Yesterday.
He's specifically asking for you, sir.
We got off the phone with Lanagin less than 30 minutes ago.
That means Tusk was the first call Lanagin made.
Tell him I'll return.
Did you reach out to the White House?
They're not talking to anyone until after the president does his press briefing tomorrow.
All right, walk me through all of this again, point by point.
- Meechum.
- We can talk tomorrow, sir.
No.
What is it?
I'd like to put in a request to be on your wife's detail full time.
At least until the death threats quiet down.
That's very thoughtful.
I'll only do it if you approve, sir.
- Have you spoken to Claire?
- When she came home.
- She likes the idea.
- Then I think we should do it.
I'll let Agent Rockland know.
Sorry for interrupting you, sir.
You didn't interrupt anything.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Meechum.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You'll never believe what just happened.
- What?
- Meechum came into the office and found me watching something...
- ...other than the news.
- Oh!
- Oh, no.
- He was very professional about it.
- Were you...?
- No, no.
I was just watching.
That's really funny.
What about you?
What are you watching?
The video Connor gave me.
It's our first state senate race.
I forgot about that.
So did I, until I found it in the desk this morning.
Let me see.
...been there, like I have.
Of course, it doesn't hurt to have a little Texas in them...
My God, look how young we are.
I know.
Everyone here has been so kind, and so welcoming.
We'll have her rooting for Clemson before too long.
That's where I have to draw the line.
Do you miss being with Adam?
Where did that come from?
Miss it?
No.
Well, you must, sometimes.
He meant a lot to me for a while.
But that's done now.
What about you?
What about me?
Are you unsatisfied?
There's just too much at stake now.
No one we can trust.
We don't have the freedom we once did.
Maybe it's better this way.
No room for distractions.
I don't mind the sacrifice.
We chose this instead.
I think the one thing we can agree on is the ribs here are better.
See, he's just trying to get under my skin.
No, it's not even debatable...
- How was California?
- Oh...
Exhausting.
Twelve events in two days.
- Is this the Golden Gate?
- Yes.
I had an etching right there.
The capitol before it was finished.
Took 85 years to complete it.
- How long did it take to complete the bridge?
- About four years.
It opened a few months after FDR's second inaugural.
There was a man who got things done.
Strong beliefs and he stuck to them.
But compromised when he had to.
I assume you're here to talk about Claire's bill.
It's not a pet project.
There are three dozen cosponsors on either side of the aisle.
- It's a serious bill.
- I don't disagree.
- Except with the language.
- I can explain my thinking, but I doubt I'll convince you anymore...
Putting aside the military's honor, chain of command, all the things that you hold dear let's consider one simple fact.
You wouldn't have this office if it weren't for me.
I made very clear that I wouldn't be a puppet.
I'm not trying to pull strings, but you could show a little gratitude.
If it were anything else, Mr. Vice President... but not this.
All you're doing is making the inevitable more difficult.
It's not inevitable.
Claire doesn't have the votes yet.
You really want to fight us on this.
I don't want to fight you at all.
Which is why I suggested to Claire that we sit down...
I neither have the time nor the inclination to negotiate with you!
Cosponsor the bill, whip the damn votes, I'm no longer asking.
Then I'm no longer listening.
You don't have just this office to thank me for.
If you win reelection, you can thank me for that, too.
Those attack ads didn't just disappear on their own.
- What do you mean?
- Why don't you ask Remy Danton.
And ask him about Raymond Tusk while you're at it.
That ought to make for some very interesting pillow talk.
You keep up the good work, Nancy.
I will, Mr. Vice President.
I miss having you around, but you're my eyes and ears now, otherwise I'd steal you back in a heartbeat.
Well, thank you, sir.
It means a lot to me that you say that.
- Doug?
- I'm busy.
The story just broke.
They timed it with the president's press conference.
Connect me with the vice president.
So the 7th Fleet is currently positioned near Guam, where it will remain if China removes its ships from Japan's sovereign waters.
I've been in frequent touch with prime minister Oshiro, and have made personal overtures to President Qian.
And I remain optimistic that tensions will be quelled without any further escalations.
So, with that, I'll take some questions.
- Henry, you first.
- Can you comment on the Wall Street Telegraph article...
I was just notified of that moments before I joined you.
I haven't had a chance to read it yet.
Yeah, Jane.
Mr. President, would you walk us through your history with Raymond Tusk?
I'm here to answer questions on Sino-Japanese relations.
Mark.
The article mentions Xander Feng, a wealthy and influential Chinese business...
Unless this has to do with the statement I just made...
It does, Mr. President.
Feng has ties to the standing committee and we're currently in a standoff with the Chinese.
Economically...
Thank you all very much.
It's not beginning the story that I fear, it's not knowing how it will end.
Everyone is fair game now, including me.
This is par for the course, what we've come to expect from President Walker.
Whenever he's selling a shiny new car, he can't say enough about it.
The engine breaks down, the transmission gives out, he dodges, he ignores the warranty.
I'm gonna tell you something, our warranty is the Constitution of the United States, and there's no limit on that.
He needs to read the fine print and start answering our questions.
If any of this is true, we're talking Congress, the White House, both parties...
Now, I'm saying "if,"
but when it look like dirty money, and it smells like dirty money, somebody has probably got dirt under their nails.
Look, there's no real proof this money laundering is even...
The connections are troubling, especially Underwood.
He was the House whip the entire time Adohi were contributing to the Democrats, and he's working side by side with the president now.
The president.
So this goes all the way to the White House?
- It might.
- It's hypothetical.
And by the way, you've cherry-picked the facts to make your case.
I'm not making a case.
PAC Money Raises Questions.
And it has.
I haven't answered those questions, but I think the American people deserve answers.
Don't you?
You can bet your bottom dollar the attorney general is gonna investigate.
- With the firestorm this is causing in the media...
- What's our course of action?
As your counsel, I would encourage you not to speak to the press until we have more information.
As your average citizen, the longer you wait, the more suspicious it looks.
If there's been any irregularity, I had nothing to do with it.
Your friendship with Tusk implies guilt by association.
Are we presuming guilt before innocence?
I'm a lawyer, I presume nothing.
But public opinion doesn't have a law degree.
Give us a few moments.
I have to advise you not to have any conversation about this matter
- without me present.
- Your advisement has been noted.
I'll be right outside.
Is this what you were keeping from me?
We should follow your counsel's advice
- and not...
- Tell me if it's true, about the money.
With Bill out of the room, we open ourselves up to...
Damn it, Frank!
I've been in the dark too long on this.
That ends now.
I don't know any details.
Feng told me if the Bridge project got approved, the GOP would stop getting money.
We approved it, the money stopped.
Jesus Christ, that connects the White House directly to the money.
No, sir.
You knew nothing, you still know nothing.
If the DOJ finds any concrete evidence of foreign money...
That's Raymond Tusk's head, not yours.
You've done nothing wrong.
Guilt by association, Frank.
You heard the man.
If the DOJ investigates, it will only prove your innocence.
Nobody walks away from something like this without bruises.
Well, bruises you can survive.
I just don't know how we can avoid it at this point.
Unless you want to accelerate the process and get rid of it.
We could always have the attorney general appoint a special prosecutor.
- That's a terrible idea.
- Maybe so.
And given where we are, Frank, I'm not inclined to follow your suggestions.
Well, I wasn't suggesting it was something you should do.
Just as a possibility.
No, in fact, I don't think you should.
I think it's better to drag these things out as long as possible.
- Let the public fatigue on it.
- And have it hanging over our heads until the midterms?
- It'll lose steam.
- What if it doesn't.
I've got the Pentagon proposing tactical drone strikes in the South China Sea.
I can't be dealing with something like this for months on end.
Maybe you're right then.
A special prosecutor is the way to go.
I didn't say that, you did.
Oh, no.
I just meant in terms of getting it off your plate.
It wouldn't be on my plate if you kept me better informed.
I have done nothing but try to insulate you, sir.
Is that what you call the feeding frenzy I just went through?
I make this solemn promise to you, Mr. President.
I will take the fall if it comes to that, but it won't.
However you decide to deal with this, I think your instincts are right.
We probably shouldn't involve a special prosecutor.
Send Bill back in.
You knew about this.
Tusk is a client, doesn't mean I know everything...
Bullshit.
The reason you're a partner at Glendon Hill is because you know the things nobody else does.
What do you want me to say?
- Is it true?
- We don't talk about work.
We're not in bed, we're in my fucking office.
And in here, you work for Frank.
- I work for no one but myself.
- Keep telling yourself that.
Unlike you, I don't peddle my goods for whoever can pay the highest retainer.
I'm the bitch to a lot of top dogs, I'm fully aware and willing, but you're worse.
You're Frank's bitch and refuse to believe it.
- That's not true.
- Case in fucking point.
Don't turn this.
You knew about the money and you didn't tell me.
Even though it's thrown my seat into contention.
Let's say there was money, and let's say I did know,
- what good would it have done?
- It means you were willing to watch me lose!
It means I respected the boundaries that you demanded.
- No changes, no special treatment.
- This is different!
- So now we're making exceptions?
- When it's this important, yes!
You can't have it both ways.
Were you...?
Was I what?
...fucking me to get info on Frank?
- Is that what you think?
- I don't know what to think.
I care about you more than I should.
But I'm getting tired of having to say it.
He's being moved to a federal psychiatric facility for assessment.
Then a high security detention center until the official sentencing.
Well, that's good to hear.
The bad news is we don't want you doing any public events for a while.
My bill's about to go to the floor.
I need to have a public profile.
Your death threats continue to rise.
We can't take the risk.
- Am I even allowed to leave the house?
- Of course.
But we want you to avoid large crowds.
Our ability to protect...
Mr. Vice President.
- Anything wrong?
- We were just briefing Mrs. Underwood on her new security protocol.
- Can we actually finish this later?
- Of course.
How did it go?
- He's skeptical.
- Should I call Tricia?
No.
It could look like I was trying to go behind his back.
We'll just have to wait and see.
I made my case.
Hopefully, he'll disagree with it.
But this could've been the wrong move.
Well, don't doubt yourself.
Seth has gotten over 3,000 e-mails in the last six hours.
- The phones are overloaded.
- So you ignore all that?
I can't ignore the Department of Justice.
What can I do?
Come and visit me when I'm in prison.
You don't have to stand by that door.
Take a load off.
Thank you, sir, but I'm supposed to stay on my feet.
Well, I won't tell if you won't.
And if anybody gives you any trouble about this, or anything, they can talk to me.
- Beautiful night.
- Yes, sir.
It's been strange not having you around these last few days.
You want me to switch back to your detail?
No, no.
I'm glad you're with Claire.
I just didn't realize how much I got used to your company until you were gone.
Protecting her is the same as protecting you, in my mind.
Oh, come on.
- Why do you do this?
- Do what, sir?
I've always been awestruck, people who are willing to take a bullet for someone else.
- That's how I serve my country.
- Well, there's a lot of ways to serve your country.
And this is my way.
- I haven't finished with this one yet.
- It's not for you.
I can't drink on duty, ma'am.
It's not for you either.
Well, come on over and join the party.
Haven't you got sick of seeing my face yet?
Never, ma'am.
To Meechum, for his loyalty and service.
To Edward.
I'm on my way to my lawyer's office, Remy.
That's not where I want to be when I'd usually be in bed.
I can't stop Frank from leaking things.
No, but you can make sure he suffers more than us.
And I say "us," Remy, because your skin is in this game now, too.
- Are you gonna deny?
- Of course I'm gonna deny.
Every step of this was legal.
They can't prove the links between them.
- What about Lanagin?
- He'll cooperate.
It's Feng we need to worry about.
I'll find a way to get in touch with him.
We do have one major advantage.
The public can hate me, but as long as Clayton West remains profitable, my stockholders won't care.
Frank doesn't have the same liberty.
Public opinion can demolish him.
You need to make sure that happens.
I can work with the Republicans on that.
Well, we'll be under the magnifying glass too.
This will be a witch hunt.
I'll make sure that they pick the right targets.
What you need to do is go after the leadership.
Make them hurt.
They'll turn on Frank to save themselves.
Birch, Womack, Sharp.
Especially Jackie Sharp.
She's his chosen one.
- Remy?
- I heard you.
I got my marching orders.
- I'm counting on you.
- I'll deliver.
Let's talk in the morning.
The two names I like the most are Justin Gaines and Heather Dunbar.
Gaines has better credentials.
But he's close to the administration.
I would've made him a federal judge if the GOP hadn't blocked it.
That's an important point.
Dunbar's got grit.
- She's more than qualified.
- No baggage there?
- She's more unpredictable.
- I doubt the attorney general would've put her on his list if he thought she was a wild card.
Sir, I have to say, I think this step is premature.
We should hold off and see what the DOJ does on its own.
I don't want to do it, Bill, but my fear is this:
if we wait until the water goes from hot to boiling, we seem reactionary, not proactive.
But proactive could also seem defensive.
Like the suspect that screams "I didn't do it" before anyone asks.
Aside from that, we simply haven't had time to prepare.
- Maybe wait a couple of weeks.
- That defeats the purpose.
- Then a few days.
- I'd like to go with Dunbar.
- Sir...
- I've made my decision.
Bill, I'd like you to convey my wishes to the attorney general.
Ultimately, the decision is his.
We can't appear to be pressuring him.
- Of course not.
- Thank you, sir.
The only thing more satisfying than convincing someone to do what I want, is failing to persuade them on purpose.
It's like a "Do Not Enter" sign, it just begs you to walk through the door.
Doyle's about halfway through our initial background check.
Every donor, every political event.
Everything that Dunbar might be looking into.
- Good.
Seth?
- We avoid any official statement, follow the president's cue.
In the meantime, I'd like to make some off the record calls.
You welcome the investigation, it's the right step, et cetera.
Give folks the personal touch.
That's fine, as long as we don't come off defensive.
I'd like to see a list of who you'd be calling.
Some of this is gonna be on the fly, it'd be great if I had a little leeway.
Let Seth do his thing, you'll have your hands full with Doyle.
I'll let you know who I've called.
All right, let's get to work.
Sir?
Yes, what is it?
I understand that you need to delegate, but when you contradict me in front of Seth, it compromises my authority over him.
You can't micromanage, we have too much to do.
Seth is still new to the team.
I need to make sure that he's doing his job properly.
- Well, I think he is.
- I'm your fail-safe, sir.
But I can't be that if you won't let me.
Are you, Doug?
- My failsafe?
- Do you doubt that?
We're flying full throttle into a hurricane, and you're talking office politics instead of focusing on making sure we don't get ripped apart.
You're right, sir.
I shouldn't have brought it up.
- Is she still there?
- Yeah.
I told her I was going for a walk.
Look, Doug, I know you said you wanted her gone, but you have to understand...
She can stay.
- What?
- She doesn't have to leave, she can stay.
I trust you to be smart.
Will you read to me?
- My Bible's inside.
- Doesn't have to be the Bible.
Just pull up something on your phone.
- Like what?
- A Tale of Two Cities.
My mom used to read it to me.
"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom,
it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope,
it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way."
Hello?
Doug, is that you?
Hello?
Hello?
Doug?
Yes, Doug, it is you.
Look at that, Cashew.
Someone's being a bad boy.
"Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour, and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice.
And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another."
Do you want me to keep going with this, or something else?
Doesn't matter to me.
I just like hearing you read it.
Doug, there's something I need to talk to you about.
You said that she was just staying for a few nights.
Her roommate kicked her out.
She doesn't have anywhere else to go.
- It's not our problem.
- I can't put her out on the street.
What's her name?
- Lisa.
- Lisa what?
You don't have anything to worry about.
- Where is she now?
- At the fellowship.
There's a sleepover with some of the kids from the day care.
Does she know about me?
No, I haven't told her anything.
I have given you space.
I trusted you, Rachel,
- and you've taken advantage--
- I'm not kicking her out.
- I could have said nothing, but I told you.
- I have to go.
She better be gone by the next time we talk.
- Sir.
- What took you so long?
I can have a briefing ready in five minutes.
Don't bother.
I had Seth do it.
He doesn't have security clearance.
Well, he does now.
Mr. President, after you.
I'll see you in my office.
Japanese sovereignty is a matter of precedent.
Mr. Prime Minister, my concern is escalation.
Well, I'm asking for a small portion of the 7th Fleet.
We must bring China into line.
Show them that the US and Japan maintain a strong alliance.
Have you reached out directly to Beijing?
No recognition that the island belongs to Japan.
Well, I'd like to speak to my team and formulate a plan.
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.
Admiral, for those catching up...
Two Chinese destroyers entered waters within three miles of Yonaguni Island here, approximately six hours ago.
See how close the island is to Taiwan.
This is different than the standoff over the Senkaku Islands.
It could have to do with shipping routes.
Or the trade war.
They can't pick on the big kids, so they're picking on the little one.
- Do you see that?
- What?
In the alley, camera two.
All posts, white male, hooded sweatshirt, duffel bag.
Southeast side of Fair St.
Put down the bag.
Put down the bag and place your hands on your head.
Stay right where you are.
Mrs. Underwood?
Will you come downstairs, please?
- Where's Francis?
- He got delayed at the White House, there was an emergency meeting.
- What's going on?
- I'll explain in the safe room.
The 7th Fleet is near Guam?
Ninety miles north.
We could have ships to Yonaguni in less than a week.
But even sending them in that direction will be picked up by the Chinese satellites.
Well, we have to stand with our allies, that can't be in question.
What if we don't send ships, just make a strong statement condemning their excursion into Japan's territorial waters.
We still have to offer the Chinese an incentive to call back their destroyers.
Whatever overtures we make, I'd like to have contingency plans in place.
- Already drafting them, sir.
- Cathy, open up a diplomatic channel with Beijing.
See if there's a concrete ask, if they don't have one, let's create a list of options.
- Right away, sir.
- How about coordination with the Japanese navy?
Go.
Don't engage with our navy yet.
I want to talk directly to Prime Minister Oshiro and express our intentions.
Former marine.
He showed up at the outer perimeter with explosives in a duffel bag.
- And strapped to his body.
- Jesus.
We apprehended him, the press isn't aware.
- Well, let's keep it that way.
- He claimed he was responsible for sending the package of white powder to the capitol.
So this time he really wanted to take me out for real.
Not exactly.
His wife got an abortion last week without telling him.
- Oh, my God.
It was me.
- Yes, you were the target.
We'd like to keep you down here with us, Mrs. Underwood,
- until we confirm he was acting alone.
- I'll stay.
No, you have to get back to the White House.
- I can work from here.
- Francis, I'm fine.
Honestly.
I'm just gonna be in here.
I want you to stick with her at all times.
Keep me informed of everything.
He's almost done with his shift, sir.
I can put another agent on--
- No, I want it to be Meechum.
- Absolutely, sir.
As long as necessary.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
It's OK.
Don't go to California.
Mm...
Be nice to be reelected.
You're gonna win.
Not if I don't give the voters more face time.
When did you get it?
- The Army?
- Yeah.
It's grown since then.
Tell me about it.
No.
Why not?
I don't want to.
What are you doing?
Tell me about the tattoo.
- That's not fair.
- So what?
You think you can just get me wet and I'll spill everything?
- I don't think so...
- Mm I know so.
Tell me.
I like the pain.
- Of the needle?
- Yeah.
How bad did it hurt?
It hurt a lot.
You like when it hurts?
I killed a lot of people.
What?
In the Army.
The pain it helped.
Finish.
The most I could find was some wrangling with the EPA when he opened his first plant, but that was almost 40 years ago.
- We need more.
I want Tusk gone.
- Doyle and I will keep looking.
If you haven't found anything now, what makes you think you will?
Maybe we missed something.
I doubt it, but we could try.
You think Tusk isn't planning his next attack even as we speak?
We've been thorough, sir.
He doesn't leave footprints.
You want to shift tactics?
The casino.
We go public as soon as possible.
You said that was a last resort.
Seth, you need to find a way to make that happen so it doesn't link to us.
If we launch that missile, it could blow us up too.
Not if we spin it right.
- If we keep the focus on--
- Seth.
You're here to listen, not contribute.
I wouldn't have him here if I didn't want him to contribute.
Sir... he's been sitting with this for three hours.
I've been working on it for three months.
And accomplished nothing.
It's time we go on the offensive.
- What do you think?
- Ayla Sayyad.
- She's already digging into Tusk and Feng.
- How close is she?
She never mentioned a casino, but now that I know what the dots are,
I can see that she's starting to connect them.
The Pentagon isn't talking yet.
I imagine they're waiting on the White House.
I hear there have been regular meetings in the Situation Room since last night.
Let me call you right back.
- Hello?
- Hey, Lynne, it's Ayla.
- I just sent you a picture.
- Yeah, I got it.
- What does it mean?
- It's strange, it doesn't make sense.
- Tell me.
- "Pursue currency" would be the most literal translation.
Or "pursue money."
- Follow the money?
- That could work.
Thanks, Lynne.
I like what you've done.
This sofa, it's new?
- These lamps as well?
- I've made a few changes.
You get so used to a place, the smallest things stand out.
I apologize for not being responsive sooner.
I've been focused on the midterms.
Oh, there's no need to explain.
Mrs. Underwood, you know how much I respect your intentions, but I've thought deeply about this and
I can't cosponsor the bill in its current form.
Civilian oversight is too extreme a step, but I'd be happy to revisit some of the other less extreme proposals.
You think we're being extremist?
I want to help with this issue, but this bill goes through--
This bill is through Armed Services.
This bill has a date on the floor.
Almost every woman in the House supports this bill.
- And I can't be one of them.
- So you lied to us.
I didn't lie.
I didn't lie.
I...
I want to help.
As long as we rethink some of the language.
Are you trying to distance yourself from us because of the Galloway scandal?
- No.
- Maybe you think it hurts your chances
- of reelection if you associate with me.
- That's not it.
It's because I honestly don't believe in this approach.
Do you realize the message this sends?
The only woman in congressional leadership in both parties, and you bow out?
If the bill goes to the floor as is, I won't just bow out.
I'll actively fight it.
You never asked my position.
You assumed.
I can't imagine what that position must be.
I've served in war zones, I know firsthand how important--
We're not talking about war zones.
We're talking about sexual assault.
How about a military commission to review the internal--
We don't need more studies, we need reform.
Well, let's continue this conversation when I return from California.
I'll be back the day after tomorrow if you change your mind.
I won't, but I hope you change yours.
China was insulted at the notion that we could buy them off.
Do I need to call President Qian?
I doubt he would contradict one of his ministers.
See if he's willing to talk one-on-one.
You should know, sir, Japan is also preparing to deploy three destroyers and a light cruiser.
They're upping the ante.
Have Ambassador Hines get in touch with the prime minister, and ask if Japan will hold off until I make contact with Beijing.
Yes, sir.
Have you gotten any rest at all?
- No, have you?
- No, not yet.
How's Claire?
Secret Service thinks it's an isolated attempt, but they're being cautious.
After the Galloway thing and the interview, half the country thinks she's a baby killer, or an adulterer, or both.
But Claire's taking it in stride.
We're in good hands.
That's very frightening.
I can see why you haven't slept.
One of us should, probably the one that's calling all the shots.
No, I can hold out a little while longer.
No, go to the residence, spend some time with your wife.
You'll come back feeling like a new man.
Honestly, it's less stressful here.
- Counseling hasn't helped?
- No, it has... slowly.
- I got rid of Christina when Linda resigned.
- I heard.
It's improved things some, but there's still work to do.
Makes me tired just to think about it.
Well, you probably wouldn't be the first president to get a little shut-eye on one of these sofas.
- I was joking.
- I wasn't.
Do the free world a favor and get some rest.
- I'll let you be.
- No, stick around.
You should be nearby if President Qian wants to get on the phone.
I've always loathed the necessity of sleep.
Like death, it puts the most powerful men on their backs.
DC Limo and Bus Rental.
I'm calling from the Adohi Casino's travel department.
We've got a corporate account.
Let's see...
I'm sorry, we don't have one in our records.
My mistake.
I must've called the wrong limo service.
Thank you.
Missouri Bus and Limo.
I'm calling from the Adohi Casino's travel department.
- You're not Darlene.
- No, Darlene is out sick.
I'm filling in for her.
My name is Pam.
How can I help you, Pam?
We've got a flight coming in from China tomorrow.
We'll need some transportation.
How many you got coming?
I don't have the manifest right in front of me.
- The usual?
- That's right.
- So a luxury bus.
- How many does that fit?
Fifty-five, usually about 20 come in.
Should be plenty of room.
That's great, thanks.
Do you think it's really her conscience, or because the bill's controversial?
I don't think she would have threatened to fight us if all she wanted to do was avoid controversy.
I'll talk to her.
I really want this bill to pass.
I know you do, so do I.
We need Jackie more than ever, Francis.
I'm damaged goods, this whole Adam thing.
No, you're not.
We fought past that.
Well, there's plenty of people who still believe it's true.
We'll get it passed, I promise.
- No, thanks.
- Come on.
It's no fun doing it alone.
We could just go for a run.
No more runs until the death threats die down, that's the new rule.
But they let you go to the office.
Because I was in a bulletproof car.
Does this mean we've officially not quit?
We've never been quitters, have we?
Sir, Mrs. Underwood, sorry to interrupt.
I was gonna head home, but I'll stick around if you want me to.
Oh, no.
You've been up long enough.
Get some sleep.
I'll be back first thing in the morning.
Thank you for looking after me today.
My pleasure, ma'am.
Sir, Mrs. Underwood.
- He's very dedicated.
- He is.
It's rare to find someone like Edward.
- What?
- You never use his first name.
Oh, did I?
I don't feel right talking about her like this.
It's just... technically, she's my boss now.
- There's a certain protocol.
- This is coming directly from Doug.
Which means it's coming directly from the vice president.
Well, um, I have seen Mr. Danton around from time to time.
Do you know what he and the congresswoman were discussing?
No, they were private meetings.
Do you have the appointment schedule?
I'd like to look at the dates.
These weren't formal appointments.
He just stops by.
Most of the time pretty late at night.
Did the money originate in China?
The money came from tribal revenue.
As our FEC reports clearly stated.
Let me rephrase.
Did any of that revenue come from Chinese visitors who gambled at your casino?
We have visitors from all over the world.
I'm speaking specifically about a businessman named Xander Feng.
I have no idea who that is.
I'm looking at FAA flight records that show a private plane he owns making numerous trips to Kansas City.
And I spoke with Missouri Bus and Limo, which has transported Chinese visitors to your casino.
- Ms. Said--
- Sayyad.
Ms. Sayyad, the only reason I returned your call was because you work for The Telegraph.
It's not every day that I get a call from a paper as big as yours.
But I don't know what you're trying to get at here, so if you'll excuse--
What about Raymond Tusk?
- What about him?
- Feng has ties to Tusk.
Tusk has ties to the president.
You have ties to Feng.
That looks like foreign money being used to influence political--
What you're insinuating is not only wrong,
- it's libelous.
- Not if it's true.
I won't bat an eyelash getting my attorneys involved.
Tusk made the same threat.
If a man worth 40 billion dollars doesn't intimidate me, you certainly don't, Mr. Lana--
Hello?
He hung up.
I had nothing to do with it, Raymond.
I can smell the horseshit through the phone.
You think I'd put myself at this great a risk?
Desperate men are capable of anything.
- I want it to go away, just like you do.
- Then pull her back.
I have no control over the press, Raymond.
You'll destroy yourself, Frank, not me.
Thank you for that unsolicited advice.
Work with Doyle, make sure we have no weak spots.
- I'll call him now.
- What did Nancy say?
Well, it looks like Jackie may be sleeping with the enemy.
Lanagin is correct in saying we run the risk of libel.
These links are supported by fact.
Individually, but you can't complete the circle.
I'm not saying the headline should read:
Money Laundering Scheme Exposed!
Just that we present the landscape as we currently know it.
We're first and foremost a financial paper.
Many of our readers worship Raymond Tusk.
So we just protect him?
We don't insinuate connections we can't back up.
If there's any basis for litigation, you can be sure his team will be aggressive.
They've bankrupted papers before.
I think you should slow down and take your time.
When, and if, you have a story--
Mr. Maxfield, Raymond Tusk is on the line.
- Did you put in a call to him?
- Yesterday.
He's specifically asking for you, sir.
We got off the phone with Lanagin less than 30 minutes ago.
That means Tusk was the first call Lanagin made.
Tell him I'll return.
Did you reach out to the White House?
They're not talking to anyone until after the president does his press briefing tomorrow.
All right, walk me through all of this again, point by point.
- Meechum.
- We can talk tomorrow, sir.
No.
What is it?
I'd like to put in a request to be on your wife's detail full time.
At least until the death threats quiet down.
That's very thoughtful.
I'll only do it if you approve, sir.
- Have you spoken to Claire?
- When she came home.
- She likes the idea.
- Then I think we should do it.
I'll let Agent Rockland know.
Sorry for interrupting you, sir.
You didn't interrupt anything.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Meechum.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You'll never believe what just happened.
- What?
- Meechum came into the office and found me watching something...
- ...other than the news.
- Oh!
- Oh, no.
- He was very professional about it.
- Were you...?
- No, no.
I was just watching.
That's really funny.
What about you?
What are you watching?
The video Connor gave me.
It's our first state senate race.
I forgot about that.
So did I, until I found it in the desk this morning.
Let me see.
...been there, like I have.
Of course, it doesn't hurt to have a little Texas in them...
My God, look how young we are.
I know.
Everyone here has been so kind, and so welcoming.
We'll have her rooting for Clemson before too long.
That's where I have to draw the line.
Do you miss being with Adam?
Where did that come from?
Miss it?
No.
Well, you must, sometimes.
He meant a lot to me for a while.
But that's done now.
What about you?
What about me?
Are you unsatisfied?
There's just too much at stake now.
No one we can trust.
We don't have the freedom we once did.
Maybe it's better this way.
No room for distractions.
I don't mind the sacrifice.
We chose this instead.
I think the one thing we can agree on is the ribs here are better.
See, he's just trying to get under my skin.
No, it's not even debatable...
- How was California?
- Oh...
Exhausting.
Twelve events in two days.
- Is this the Golden Gate?
- Yes.
I had an etching right there.
The capitol before it was finished.
Took 85 years to complete it.
- How long did it take to complete the bridge?
- About four years.
It opened a few months after FDR's second inaugural.
There was a man who got things done.
Strong beliefs and he stuck to them.
But compromised when he had to.
I assume you're here to talk about Claire's bill.
It's not a pet project.
There are three dozen cosponsors on either side of the aisle.
- It's a serious bill.
- I don't disagree.
- Except with the language.
- I can explain my thinking, but I doubt I'll convince you anymore--
Putting aside the military's honor, chain of command, all the things that you hold dear let's consider one simple fact.
You wouldn't have this office if it weren't for me.
I made very clear that I wouldn't be a puppet.
I'm not trying to pull strings, but you could show a little gratitude.
If it were anything else, Mr. Vice President... but not this.
All you're doing is making the inevitable more difficult.
It's not inevitable.
Claire doesn't have the votes yet.
You really want to fight us on this.
I don't want to fight you at all.
Which is why I suggested to Claire that we sit down--
I neither have the time nor the inclination to negotiate with you!
Cosponsor the bill, whip the damn votes, I'm no longer asking.
Then I'm no longer listening.
You don't have just this office to thank me for.
If you win reelection, you can thank me for that, too.
Those attack ads didn't just disappear on their own.
- What do you mean?
- Why don't you ask Remy Danton.
And ask him about Raymond Tusk while you're at it.
That ought to make for some very interesting pillow talk.
You keep up the good work, Nancy.
I will, Mr. Vice President.
I miss having you around, but you're my eyes and ears now, otherwise I'd steal you back in a heartbeat.
Well, thank you, sir.
It means a lot to me that you say that.
- Doug?
- I'm busy.
The story just broke.
They timed it with the president's press conference.
Connect me with the vice president.
So the 7th Fleet is currently positioned near Guam, where it will remain if China removes its ships from Japan's sovereign waters.
I've been in frequent touch with prime minister Oshiro, and have made personal overtures to President Qian.
And I remain optimistic that tensions will be quelled without any further escalations.
So, with that, I'll take some questions.
- Henry, you first.
- Can you comment on the Wall Street Telegraph article--
I was just notified of that moments before I joined you.
I haven't had a chance to read it yet.
Yeah, Jane.
Mr. President, would you walk us through your history with Raymond Tusk?
I'm here to answer questions on Sino-Japanese relations.
Mark.
The article mentions Xander Feng, a wealthy and influential Chinese business--
Unless this has to do with the statement I just made--
It does, Mr. President.
Feng has ties to the standing committee and we're currently in a standoff with the Chinese.
Economically--
Thank you all very much.
It's not beginning the story that I fear, it's not knowing how it will end.
Everyone is fair game now, including me.
This is par for the course, what we've come to expect from President Walker.
Whenever he's selling a shiny new car, he can't say enough about it.
The engine breaks down, the transmission gives out, he dodges, he ignores the warranty.
I'm gonna tell you something, our warranty is the Constitution of the United States, and there's no limit on that.
He needs to read the fine print and start answering our questions.
If any of this is true, we're talking Congress, the White House, both parties...
Now, I'm saying "if,"
but when it looks like dirty money, and it smells like dirty money, somebody has probably got dirt under their nails.
Look, there's no real proof this money laundering is even--
The connections are troubling, especially Underwood.
He was the House whip the entire time Adohi were contributing to the Democrats, and he's working side by side with the president now.
The president.
So this goes all the way to the White House?
- It might.
- It's hypothetical.
And by the way, you've cherry-picked the facts to make your case.
I'm not making a case.
My headline is:
PAC Money Raises Questions.
And it has.
I haven't answered those questions, but I think the American people deserve answers.
Don't you?
You can bet your bottom dollar the attorney general is gonna investigate.
- With the firestorm this is causing in the media--
- What's our course of action?
As your counsel, I would encourage you not to speak to the press until we have more information.
As your average citizen, the longer you wait, the more suspicious it looks.
If there's been any irregularity, I had nothing to do with it.
Your friendship with Tusk implies guilt by association.
Are we presuming guilt before innocence?
I'm a lawyer, I presume nothing.
But public opinion doesn't have a law degree.
Give us a few moments.
I have to advise you not to have any conversation about this matter
- without me present.
- Your advisement has been noted.
I'll be right outside.
Is this what you were keeping from me?
We should follow your counsel's advice
- and not--
- Tell me if it's true, about the money.
With Bill out of the room, we open ourselves up to--
Damn it, Frank!
I've been in the dark too long on this.
That ends now.
I don't know any details.
Feng told me if the Bridge project got approved, the GOP would stop getting money.
We approved it, the money stopped.
Jesus Christ, that connects the White House directly to the money.
No, sir.
You knew nothing, you still know nothing.
If the DOJ finds any concrete evidence of foreign money--
That's Raymond Tusk's head, not yours.
You've done nothing wrong.
Guilt by association, Frank.
You heard the man.
If the DOJ investigates, it will only prove your innocence.
Nobody walks away from something like this without bruises.
Well, bruises you can survive.
I just don't know how we can avoid it at this point.
Unless you want to accelerate the process and get rid of it.
We could always have the attorney general appoint a special prosecutor.
- That's a terrible idea.
- Maybe so.
And given where we are, Frank, I'm not inclined to follow your suggestions.
Well, I wasn't suggesting it was something you should do.
Just as a possibility.
No, in fact, I don't think you should.
I think it's better to drag these things out as long as possible.
- Let the public fatigue on it.
- And have it hanging over our heads until the midterms?
- It'll lose steam.
- What if it doesn't.
I've got the Pentagon proposing tactical drone strikes in the South China Sea.
I can't be dealing with something like this for months on end.
Maybe you're right then.
A special prosecutor is the way to go.
I didn't say that, you did.
Oh, no.
I just meant in terms of getting it off your plate.
It wouldn't be on my plate if you kept me better informed.
I have done nothing but try to insulate you, sir.
Is that what you call the feeding frenzy I just went through?
I make this solemn promise to you, Mr. President.
I will take the fall if it comes to that, but it won't.
However you decide to deal with this, I think your instincts are right.
We probably shouldn't involve a special prosecutor.
Send Bill back in.
You knew about this.
Tusk is a client, doesn't mean I know everything--
Bullshit.
The reason you're a partner at Glendon Hill is because you know the things nobody else does.
What do you want me to say?
- Is it true?
- We don't talk about work.
We're not in bed, we're in my fucking office.
And in here, you work for Frank.
- I work for no one but myself.
- Keep telling yourself that.
Unlike you, I don't peddle my goods for whoever can pay the highest retainer.
I'm the bitch to a lot of top dogs, I'm fully aware and willing, but you're worse.
You're Frank's bitch and refuse to believe it.
- That's not true.
- Case in fucking point.
Don't turn this.
You knew about the money and you didn't tell me.
Even though it's thrown my seat into contention.
Let's say there was money, and let's say I did know,
- what good would it have done?
- It means you were willing to watch me lose!
It means I respected the boundaries that you demanded.
- No changes, no special treatment.
- This is different!
- So now we're making exceptions?
- When it's this important, yes!
You can't have it both ways.
Were you...?
Was I what?
...fucking me to get info on Frank?
- Is that what you think?
- I don't know what to think.
I care about you more than I should.
But I'm getting tired of having to say it.
He's being moved to a federal psychiatric facility for assessment.
Then a high security detention center until the official sentencing.
Well, that's good to hear.
The bad news is we don't want you doing any public events for a while.
My bill's about to go to the floor.
I need to have a public profile.
Your death threats continue to rise.
We can't take the risk.
- Am I even allowed to leave the house?
- Of course.
But we want you to avoid large crowds.
Our ability to protect-- Mr. Vice President.
- Anything wrong?
- We were just briefing Mrs. Underwood on her new security protocol.
- Can we actually finish this later?
- Of course.
How did it go?
- He's skeptical.
- Should I call Tricia?
No.
It could look like I was trying to go behind his back.
We'll just have to wait and see.
I made my case.
Hopefully, he'll disagree with it.
But this could've been the wrong move.
Well, don't doubt yourself.
Seth has gotten over 3,000 e-mails in the last six hours.
- The phones are overloaded.
- So you ignore all that?
I can't ignore the Department of Justice.
What can I do?
Come and visit me when I'm in prison.
You don't have to stand by that door.
Take a load off.
Thank you, sir, but I'm supposed to stay on my feet.
Well, I won't tell if you won't.
And if anybody gives you any trouble about this, or anything, they can talk to me.
- Beautiful night.
- Yes, sir.
It's been strange not having you around these last few days.
You want me to switch back to your detail?
No, no.
I'm glad you're with Claire.
I just didn't realize how much I got used to your company until you were gone.
Protecting her is the same as protecting you, in my mind.
Oh, come on.
- Why do you do this?
- Do what, sir?
I've always been awestruck, people who are willing to take a bullet for someone else.
- That's how I serve my country.
- Well, there's a lot of ways to serve your country.
And this is my way.
- I haven't finished with this one yet.
- It's not for you.
I can't drink on duty, ma'am.
It's not for you either.
Well, come on over and join the party.
Haven't you got sick of seeing my face yet?
Never, ma'am.
To Meechum, for his loyalty and service.
To Edward.
I'm on my way to my lawyer's office, Remy.
That's not where I want to be when I'd usually be in bed.
I can't stop Frank from leaking things.
No, but you can make sure he suffers more than us.
And I say "us," Remy, because your skin is in this game now, too.
- Are you gonna deny?
- Of course I'm gonna deny.
Every step of this was legal.
They can't prove the links between them.
- What about Lanagin?
- He'll cooperate.
It's Feng we need to worry about.
I'll find a way to get in touch with him.
We do have one major advantage.
The public can hate me, but as long as Clayton West remains profitable, my stockholders won't care.
Frank doesn't have the same liberty.
Public opinion can demolish him.
You need to make sure that happens.
I can work with the Republicans on that.
Well, we'll be under the magnifying glass too.
This will be a witch hunt.
I'll make sure that they pick the right targets.
What you need to do is go after the leadership.
Make them hurt.
They'll turn on Frank to save themselves.
Birch, Womack, Sharp.
Especially Jackie Sharp.
She's his chosen one.
- Remy?
- I heard you.
I got my marching orders.
- I'm counting on you.
- I'll deliver.
Let's talk in the morning.
The two names I like the most are Justin Gaines and Heather Dunbar.
Gaines has better credentials.
But he's close to the administration.
I would've made him a federal judge if the GOP hadn't blocked it.
That's an important point.
Dunbar's got grit.
- She's more than qualified.
- No baggage there?
- She's more unpredictable.
- I doubt the attorney general would've put her on his list if he thought she was a wild card.
Sir, I have to say, I think this step is premature.
We should hold off and see what the DOJ does on its own.
I don't want to do it, Bill, but my fear is this:
if we wait until the water goes from hot to boiling, we seem reactionary, not proactive.
But proactive could also seem defensive.
Like the suspect that screams "I didn't do it" before anyone asks.
Aside from that, we simply haven't had time to prepare.
- Maybe wait a couple of weeks.
- That defeats the purpose.
- Then a few days.
- I'd like to go with Dunbar.
- Sir--
- I've made my decision.
Bill, I'd like you to convey my wishes to the attorney general.
Ultimately, the decision is his.
We can't appear to be pressuring him.
- Of course not.
- Thank you, sir.
The only thing more satisfying than convincing someone to do what I want, is failing to persuade them on purpose.
It's like a "Do Not Enter" sign, it just begs you to walk through the door.
Doyle's about halfway through our initial background check.
Every donor, every political event.
Everything that Dunbar might be looking into.
- Good.
Seth?
- We avoid any official statement, follow the president's cue.
In the meantime, I'd like to make some off the record calls.
You welcome the investigation, it's the right step, et cetera.
Give folks the personal touch.
That's fine, as long as we don't come off defensive.
I'd like to see a list of who you'd be calling.
Some of this is gonna be on the fly, it'd be great if I had a little leeway.
Let Seth do his thing, you'll have your hands full with Doyle.
I'll let you know who I've called.
All right, let's get to work.
Sir?
Yes, what is it?
I understand that you need to delegate, but when you contradict me in front of Seth, it compromises my authority over him.
You can't micromanage, we have too much to do.
Seth is still new to the team.
I need to make sure that he's doing his job properly.
- Well, I think he is.
- I'm your fail-safe, sir.
But I can't be that if you won't let me.
Are you, Doug?
- My failsafe?
- Do you doubt that?
We're flying full throttle into a hurricane, and you're talking office politics instead of focusing on making sure we don't get ripped apart.
You're right, sir.
I shouldn't have brought it up.
- Is she still there?
- Yeah.
I told her I was going for a walk.
Look, Doug, I know you said you wanted her gone, but you have to understand--
She can stay.
- What?
- She doesn't have to leave, she can stay.
I trust you to be smart.
Will you read to me?
- My Bible's inside.
- Doesn't have to be the Bible.
Just pull up something on your phone.
- Like what?
- A Tale of Two Cities.
My mom used to read it to me.
"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom,
it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope,
it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way."
Hello?
Doug, is that you?
Hello?
Hello?
Doug?
Yes, Doug, it is you.
Well, look at that, Cashew.
Someone's being a bad boy.
"And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God,
"by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
"Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor
"and evil speaking be put away from you, with all malice.
"And be kind to one another.
"Tenderhearted.
Forgiving one another."
Do you want me to keep going with this or something else?
Doesn't matter to me.
I just like hearing you read it.
Doug, there's something I need to talk to you about
You said that she was just staying for a few nights.
Her roommate kicked her out.
She doesn't have anywhere else to go.
That's not our problem.
Well, I can't just put her out on the street.
What's her name?
Lisa.
Lisa what?
You don't have anything to worry about
Where is she now?
At the fellowship.
There's a sleepover with some of the kids in the daycare.
Does she know about me?
No.
I haven't told her anything.
I have given you space.
I trusted you, Rachel, and you've taken...
I'm not kicking her out.
I could've said nothing, but I told you.
I have to go.
She better be gone by the next time we talk.
You want me to brief commerce...
Sir.
What took you so long?
I can have a briefing ready for you in five minutes.
Don't bother.
I had Seth do it.
He doesn't have security clearance.
Well, he does now.
Mr. President, after you.
I'll see you in my office.
Japanese sovereignty is a matter of precedent.
Mr. Prime Minister, my concern is escalation.
Well, I'm asking for a small portion of the Seventh Fleet.
We must bring China into line.
Show them that the US and Japan maintain a strong alliance.
Have you reached out directly to Beijing?
No recognition that the island belongs to Japan.
Well, I'd like to speak to my team and formulate a plan.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.
Admiral, for those catching up.
Two Chinese destroyers entered waters within three miles of Yonaguni Island here, approximately six hours ago.
You can see how close the island is to Taiwan.
Now this is different than the standoff over the Senkaku Islands.
It could have to do with shipping routes.
Or the trade war.
They can't pick on the big kid.
so they're picking on the little one.
Did you see that?
What?
In the alley.
Camera two.
All units.
White male, hooded sweatshirt
Duffel bag.
Southeast side of Fair Street.
Put down the bag.
Put down the bag and place your hands on your head.
Stay right where you are.
Mrs. Underwood?
Will you come downstairs, please?
Where's Francis?
He got delayed at the White House.
There was an emergency meeting.
What's going on?
I'll explain in the safe room.
The Seventh Fleet is near Guam?
Ninety miles north.
We could have ships to Yonaguni in less than a week.
But even sending them in that direction will be picked up by the Chinese satellites.
We have to stand with our allies.
That can't be in question.
What if we don't send ships?
Just make a strong statement condemning their excursion into Japan's territorial waters.
We still have to offer the Chinese an incentive to call back their destroyers.
Whatever overtures we make,
I'd like to have contingency plans in place.
Already drafting them, sir.
Cathy, open up a diplomatic channel with Beijing.
See if there's a concrete ask.
If they don't have one, let's create a list of options.
Right away, sir.
How about coordination with the Japanese navy?
Go.
Don't engage with their navy yet.
I want to talk directly to Prime Minister Oshiro and express our intentions.
Former Marine.
He showed up at the outer perimeter with explosives in a duffel bag and strapped to his body.
Jesus.
We apprehended him.
The press isn't aware.
Well, let's keep it that way.
He claimed he was responsible for sending the package of white powder to the Capitol.
So this time he really wanted to take me out for real.
Not exactly.
His wife got an abortion last week without telling him.
Oh, my God.
It was me.
Yes, you were the target.
We'd like to keep you down here with us, Mrs. Underwood, until we can confirm he was acting alone.
I'll stay.
No.
You have to get back to the White House.
No, but I can work from here.
Francis, I'm fine.
Honestly.
I'm just gonna be in here.
I want you to stick with her at all times.
Keep me informed of everything.
He's almost done with his shift, sir.
I can put another agent...
No, I want it to be Meechum.
Absolutely, sir.
As long as necessary.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Okay.
It's okay.
Don't go to California.
Hmm, it'd be nice to be reelected.
You're gonna win.
Not if I don't give the voters more face time.
When'd you get it?
The Army?
Yeah. it's grown since then.
Tell me about it.
No.
Why not?
I don't want to.
What are you doing?
Tell me about the tattoo.
Mmm.
That's not fair.
So what?
You think you can just get me wet and I'll spill everything?
I think so.
I know so.
Tell me.
I like the pain.
Of the needle?
Yeah.
How bad did it hurt?
It hurt a lot.
You like when it hurts?
I killed a lot of people.
What?
In the Army.
The pain, it helped.
Finish.
Most I could find was some wrangling with the EPA when he opened his first plant, but that was almost 40 years ago.
We need more.
I want Tusk gone.
Doyle and I will keep looking.
If you haven't found anything now, what makes you think you will?
Maybe we missed something.
I doubt it, but we could try.
You think Tusk isn't planning his next attack even as we speak?
We've been thorough, sir.
He doesn't leave footprints.
You want to shift tactics?
The casino.
We go public as soon as possible.
You said that was a last resort.
Seth, you need to find a way to make that happen so it doesn't link back to us.
If we launch that missile, it could blow us up, too.
Not if we spin it right.
If we keep the focus on...
Seth, you're here to listen.
Not contribute.
I wouldn't have him here if I didn't want him to contribute.
Sir, he's been sitting with this for three hours.
I've been working on it for three months.
And accomplished nothing.
It's time we go on the offensive.
What are you thinking?
Ayla Sayyad.
She's already digging into Tusk and Feng.
How close is she?
She never mentioned a casino.
But now that I know what the dots are,
I can see that she's starting to connect them.
The Pentagon isn't talking yet.
I imagine they're waiting on the White House.
I hear there have been regular meetings in the Situation Room since last night.
Uh, let me call you right back.
Hello?
Hey, Lynn.
It's Ayla.
I just sent you a picture.
Yeah, I got it.
What does it mean?
It's strange.
It doesn't realty make sense.
Tell me.
"Pursue currency" would be the most literal translation.
Or "pursue money"
"Follow the money"?
That could work.
Thanks, Lynn.
I like what you've done.
The sofa is new.
These lamps as well.
I've made a few changes.
Yeah, you get so used to a place, the smallest things stand out.
I apologize for not being responsive sooner.
I've been focused on the midterms.
Oh, there's no need to explain.
Mrs. Underwood, you know how much I respect your intentions.
But I've thought deeply about this, and I can't co-sponsor the bill in its current form.
Civilian oversight is too extreme a step.
But I'd be happy to revisit some of the other, less extreme proposals.
You think we're being extremist?
I want to help with this issue, but this bill goes against...
This bill is through Armed Services.
This bill has a date on the floor.
Almost every woman in the House supports this bill.
And I can't be one of them.
So you lied to us.
I didn't lie.
I didn't lie.
I want to help.
As long as we rethink some of the language...
Are you trying to distance yourself from us because of the Galloway scandal?
No.
Maybe you think it hurts your chances of reelection if you associate with me.
That's not it.
It's because I honestly don't believe in this approach.
Do you realize the message this sends?
The only woman in Congressional leadership, in both parties, and you bow out?
If the bill goes to the floor as is, I won't just bow out.
I'll actively fight it.
You never asked my position.
You assumed.
I can't imagine what that position must be.
I've served in war zones.
I know first-hand how important chain of command...
We're not talking about war zones.
We're talking about sexual assault.
How about a military commission to review the internal mechanisms...
We don't need more studies.
We need reform.
Well, let's continue this conversation when I return from California.
I'll be back the day after tomorrow, if you change your mind.
I won't.
But I hope you change yours.
China was insulted at the notion we could buy them off.
Well, do I need to call President Qian?
I doubt he would contradict one of his ministers.
See if he's willing to talk one-on-one.
You should know, sir,
Japan is also preparing to deploy three destroyers and a light cruiser.
They're upping the ante.
Have Ambassador Hynes get in touch with the Prime Minister.
Ask if Japan will hold off until I've made contact with Beijing.
Yes, sir.
Have you gotten any rest at all?
No.
Have you?
Not yet.
How's Claire?
The Secret Service thinks it's an isolated attempt.
But they're being cautious.
After the Galloway thing and the interview, half the country thinks she's a baby killer or an adulterer, or both.
But Claire's taking it in stride, and we're in good hands.
Well, it's very frightening.
I can see why you haven't slept.
One of us should.
Probably the one who's calling all the shots.
No, I can hold out a little while longer.
No, go to the residence.
Spend some time with your wife.
You'll come back feeling like a new man.
Honestly, it's less stressful here.
Counseling hasn't helped.
No, it has.
Slowly.
You know, I got rid of Christina when Linda resigned?
I heard.
It's improved things some.
But there's still work to do.
Makes me tired just to think about it.
Well, you probably wouldn't be the first president to get a little shut-eye on one of these sofas.
I was joking.
I wasn't.
Do the free world a favor and get some rest.
I'll let you be.
No, stick around.
You should be nearby if President Qian wants to get on the phone.
I've always loathed the necessity of sleep.
Like death, it puts even the most powerful men on their backs.
KC Limo and Bus rental.
I'm calling from the Adohi Casino's travel department.
We've got a corporate account.
Let's see.
Yeah, I'm sorry, we don't have one in our records.
My mistake.
I must have called the wrong limo service.
Thank you.
MissouriBusandLimo.
I'm calling from the Adohi Casino's travel department.
You're not Darlene.
No.
Darlene is out sick.
I'm filling in for her.
My name is Pam.
How can I help you, Pam?
We've got a flight coming in from China tomorrow.
We'll need some transportation.
How many you got coming?
I don't have the manifest right in front of me.
The usual?
That's right.
So a luxury bus.
How many does that fit?
Fifty-five.
Usually about 20 come in.
Should be plenty of room.
That's great.
Thanks.
Do you think it's really her conscience or because the bill is controversial?
I don't think she would have threatened to fight us if all she wanted to do was avoid controversy.
I'll talk to her.
I really want this bill to pass.
I know you do.
So do I.
We need Jackie more than ever, Francis.
I'm damaged goods with this whole Adam thing.
No, you're not.
We fought past that
Well, there's plenty of people who still believe it's true.
We'll get it passed.
I promise.
No, thanks.
Come on.
It's no fun doing it alone.
We could just go for a run.
No more runs until the death threats die down.
That's the new rule.
But they let you go to the office.
Because I was in a bulletproof car.
Does this mean that we've officially not quit?
We've never been quitters, have we?
Sir, Mrs. Underwood.
Sorry to interrupt.
I was gonna head home, but I'll stick around if you want me to.
Oh, no.
You've been up long enough.
Get some sleep.
I'll be back first thing in the morning.
Thank you for looking after me today.
My pleasure, ma'am.
Sir.
Mrs. Underwood.
He's very dedicated.
He is.
It's rare to find someone like Edward.
What?
You never use his first name.
Oh, did I?
I don't feel right talking about her like this.
It's just...
Technically she's my boss now.
And there's a certain protocol.
This is coming directly from Doug, which means it's coming directly from the Vice President.
Well, I have seen Mr. Danton around from time to time.
Do you know what he and the Congresswoman were discussing?
No.
They were private meetings.
Do you have the appointment schedule?
I'd like to look at the dates.
These weren't formal appointments.
He just stops by.
Most of the time, pretty late at night.
Did the money originate in China?
The money came from tribal revenue, as our FEC reports clearly state.
Let me rephrase.
Did any of that revenue come from Chinese visitors who gambled at your casino?
We have visitors from all over the world.
I'm speaking specifically about a businessman named Xander Feng.
I have no idea who that is.
I'm looking at FAA flight records that show a private plane he owns making numerous trips to Kansas City,.
And I spoke with Missouri Bus and Limo, which has transported Chinese visitors to your casino.
Miss Syed...
Sayyad.
Miss Sayyad.
The only reason I returned your call was because you work for the Telegraph.
And it's not every day that I get a call from a paper as big as yours.
But I really don't know what you're trying to get at here, so if you'll excuse me...
What about Raymond Tusk?
What about him?
Feng has ties to Tusk.
Tusk has ties to the President.
You have ties to Feng.
That looks like foreign money being used to influence political...
What you're insinuating is not only wrong, it's libelous.
Not if it's true.
I won't bat an eyelash getting my attorneys involved.
Tusk made the same threat.
If a man worth $40 billion doesn't intimidate me, you certainly don't, Mr. Lan...
Hello?
He hung up.
I had nothing to do with it, Raymond.
I can smell the horseshit through the phone.
You think I'd put myself at this great a risk?
Desperate men are capable of anything.
I want it to go away just like you do.
Then pull her back.
I have no control over the press, Raymond.
You'll destroy yourself, Frank.
Not me.
Thank you for that unsolicited advice.
Work with Doyle.
Make sure we have no weak spots.
I'll call him now.
What did Nancy say?
Well, it looks like Jackie may be sleeping with the enemy.
Lanagin is correct in saying we run the risk of libel.
These links are supported by fact.
Individually, but you can't complete the circle.
I'm not saying the headline should read
"Money Laundering Scheme Exposed," exclamation point.
Just that we present the landscape as we currently know it.
We're first and foremost a financial paper.
Many of our readers worship Raymond Tusk.
So we just protect him?
No.
We don't insinuate connections we can't back up.
If there's any basis for litigation, you can be sure his team will be aggressive.
Yeah, they've bankrupted papers before.
I think you should slow down and take your time.
When and if you have a story you can fully...
Mr. Maxfield?
Raymond Tusk is on the line.
Did you put in a call to him?
Yesterday.
He's specifically asking for you, sir.
We got off the phone with Lanagin less than 30 minutes ago.
That means that Tusk was the first call Lanagin made.
Tell him I'll return.
Did you reach out to the While House?
They're not talking to anyone until after the President does his press briefing tomorrow.
All right.
Walk me through all of this again, point by point.
Meechum.
We can talk tomorrow, sir.
No.
What is it?
I'd like to put in a request to be on your wife's detail full-time.
At least until the death threats quiet down.
That's very thoughtful.
I'll only do it if you approve, sir.
Have you spoken to Claire?
When she came home.
She likes the idea.
Then I think we should do it.
I'll let Agent Rockland know.
Sorry for interrupting you, sir.
You didn't interrupt anything.
Good night, sir.
Good night, Meechum.
What the fifth district needs is someone who understands...
Hey.
Hey.
You will never believe what just happened.
What?
Meechum came into the office and found me watching something other than the news.
Oh, no.
He was very professional about it.
Were you...
No, no, no.
I was just watching.
That's really funny.
What about you?
What are you watching?
The video Connor gave me.
It's our first state senate race.
Oh, I forgot about that.
So did I, until I found it in the desk this morning.
Let me see.
...been there like I have.
Of course, it doesn't hurt to have a little Texas in the mix.
My God.
Look how young we are.
I know.
Everyone here has been so kind, so welcoming.
We'llhaveherrooting for Clemson before too long,
Nowthat'swhere I have to draw the line.
Do you miss being with Adam?
Where did that come from?
Miss it?
No.
Well, you must.
Sometimes.
He meant a lot to me for a while.
But that's done now.
What about you?
What about me?
Are you unsatisfied?
There's just too much at stake now.
No one we can trust.
We don't have the freedom we once did.
Maybe it's better this way.
No room for distractions.
I don't mind the sacrifice.
We chose this instead.
Well, I think the one thing we can agree on is the ribs here are better.
You see, he's just trying to get under my skin now.
It'snotevendebatable.
No offense to...
Oh.
How's California?
Um...
Exhausting.
Twelve events in two days.
Is this the Golden Gate?
Yes.
I had an etching right there of the Capitol before it was finished.
Took 85 years to complete it.
How long did it take to complete the bridge?
Uh, about four years.
It opened a few months after FDR's second inaugural.
There was a man who got things done.
Strong beliefs.
And he stuck to them.
But compromised when he had to.
I assume you're here to talk about Claire's bill.
It's not a pet project.
There are three dozen co-sponsors on either side of the aisle.
It's a serious bill.
I don't disagree.
Except with the language.
I can explain my thinking, but I doubt I'll convince you any more than you'll convince me.
Putting aside the military's honor, chain of command, all the things that you hold dear,
let's consider one simple fact.
You wouldn't have this office if it weren't for me.
I made very clear that I wouldn't be a puppet.
I'm not trying to pull strings.
But you could show a little gratitude.
If it were anything else, Mr. Vice President.
But not this.
All you're doing is making the inevitable more difficult.
It's not inevitable.
Claire doesn't have the votes yet.
You really want to fight us on this?
I don't want to fight you at all, which is why I suggested to Claire that we sit down...
I neither have the time nor the inclination to negotiate with you!
Co-sponsor the bill!
Whip the damn votes!
I'm no longer asking!
Then I'm no longer listening.
You don't have just this office to thank me for.
If you win reelection, you can thank me for that, too.
Those attack ads didn't just disappear on their own.
What do you mean?
Why don't you ask Remy Danton?
And ask him about Raymond Tusk while you're at it.
That ought to make for some very interesting pillow talk.
You keep up the good work, Nancy.
I will, Mr. Vice President.
I miss having you around.
But you're my eyes and ears now.
Otherwise I'd steal you back in a heartbeat.
Well, thank you, sir.
It means a lot to me that you say that.
Doug.
I'm busy.
The story just broke.
They timed it with the President's press conference.
Connect me with the Vice President.
So the Seventh Fleet is currently positioned near Guam, where it will remain if China removes its ships from Japan's sovereign waters.
I've been in frequent touch with Prime Minister Oshiro and have made personal overtures to President Qian.
And I remain optimistic that tensions will be quelled without any further escalations.
So with that, I'll take some questions.
Mr. President!
Henry, you first.
Can you comment on the Wall Street Telegraph article, which suggests...
Yeah, I was just notified of that moments before I joined you.
I haven't had a chance to read it yet.
Yeah, Jane?
Mr. President, would you walk us through your history with Raymond Tusk?
I'm here to answer questions on Sino-Japanese relations.
Mark?
The article mentions Xander Feng, a wealthy and influential Chinese businessman...
Unless this has to do with the statement I just made".
It does, Mr. President.
Feng has ties to the standing committee.
And we're currently in a standoff with the Chinese.
Economically...
All right, thank you all very much.
It's not beginning the story that I fear.
It's not knowing how it will end.
Everyone is fair game now.
Including me.
This is par for the course from what we come to expect from President Walker.
Whenever he's selling a shiny new car, he can't say enough about it.
The engine breaks down, the transmission gives out, he dodges, he ignores the warranty.
Well, I'm gonna tell you something.
Our warranty is the Constitution of the United States.
And there's no limit on that.
He needs to read the fine print and start answering our questions.
If any of this is true, we're talking Congress, the White House, both parties.
Now, I'm saying "if."
But when it looks like dirty money and it smells like dirty money, somebody has probably got dirt under their nails.
There's no real proof this money laundering even...
But the connections are troubling.
Especially Underwood.
He was the House whip the entire time the Adohi were contributing to the Democrats.
And he's working side by side with the President now.
The President.
So this goes all the way to the White House?
It might.
That's hypothetical.
And by the way, you've cherry-picked the facts to make your case.
I'm not making a case.
My headline is "PAC Money Raises Questions." And it has.
I haven't answered those questions, but I think the American people deserve answers, don't you?
You can bet your bottom dollar the Attorney General is going to investigate.
With the firestorm this is causing in the media...
So what's our course of action?
As your counsel, I will encourage you not to speak to the press until we have more information.
As your average citizen, the longer you wait, the more suspicious it looks.
If there's been any irregularity, I had nothing to do with it.
Your friendship with Tusk implies guilt by association.
Are we presuming guilt before innocence?
I'm a lawyer.
I presume nothing.
But public opinion doesn't have a law degree.
Give us a few moments.
I have to advise you not to have any conversation about this matter without me present.
Your advisement has been noted.
I'll be right outside.
Is this what you were keeping from me?
We should follow your counsel's advice and not."
Tell me if it's true.
About the money.
With Bill out of the room, we open ourselves up to all sorts...
Damn it, Frank.
I've been in the dark for too long on this.
That ends now.
I don't know any details.
Feng told me if the bridge project got approved, the GOP would stop getting money.
We approved it.
The money stopped.
Jesus Christ.
That connects the White House directly to the money.
No, sir.
You knew nothing.
You still know nothing.
If the DOJ finds any concrete evidence of foreign money...
Then that's Raymond Tusk's head, not yours.
You've done nothing wrong.
Guilt by association, Frank.
You heard the man.
If the DOJ investigates, it will only prove your innocence.
Nobody walks away from something like this without bruises.
Well, bruises you can survive.
I just don't know how we can avoid it at this point.
Unless you want to accelerate the process and get rid of it.
You could always have the Attorney General appoint a special prosecutor.
That's a terrible idea.
Maybe so.
And given where we are, Frank,
I'm not inclined to follow your suggestions.
Well, I wasn't suggesting it as something you should do.
Just as a possibility.
No, in fact, I don't think you should.
I think it's better to drag these things out as long as possible.
Let the public fatigue on it.
And have it hanging over our heads until the midterms?
It'll lose steam.
What if it doesn't?
I've got the Pentagon proposing tactical drone strikes in the South China Sea.
I can't be dealing with something like this for months on end.
Maybe you're right, then.
A special prosecutor is the way to go.
I didn't say that.
You did.
No, I just meant in terms of getting it off your plate.
It wouldn't be on my plate if you'd kept me better informed.
I have done nothing but try to insulate you, sir.
Is that what you call the feeding frenzy I went through?
I make this solemn promise to you, Mr. President.
I will take the fall if it comes to that, but it won't.
However you decide to deal with this,
I think your instincts are right.
Probably shouldn't involve a special prosecutor.
Send Bill back in.
You knew about this.
Tusk is a client.
Doesn't mean I know everything he...
Bullshit.
The reason you're a partner at Glendon Hill is because you know the things nobody else does.
What do you want me to say?
Is it true?
We don't talk about work.
We're not in bed.
We're in my fucking office.
And in here, you work for Frank.
I work for no one but myself.
Keep telling yourself that
Unlike you, I don't peddle my goods for whoever can pay the highest retainer.
I'm the bitch to a lot of top dogs.
I'm fully aware and willing.
But you're worse.
You're Frank's bitch and refuse to believe it.
That's not true.
Case in fucking point.
Don't turn this.
You knew about the money and you didn't tell me, even though it's thrown my seat into contention.
Let's say there was money.
And let's say I did know.
What good would it have done?
It means you were willing to watch me lose.
It means I respected the boundaries that you demanded.
No changes, no special treatment.
This is different.
So now we're making exceptions?
When it's this important, yes.
You can't have it both ways.
Were you...
Was I what?
Fucking me to get info on Frank.
Is that what you think?
I don't know what to think.
I care about you more than I should.
But I'm getting tired of having to say it.
He's being moved to a federal psychiatric facility for assessment, then a high-security detention center until the official sentencing.
Well, that's good to hear.
The bad news is we don't want you doing any public events for a while.
My bill is about to go to the floor.
I need to have a public profile.
Your death threats continue to rise.
We can't take the risk.
Am I even allowed to leave the house?
Of course.
But we want you to avoid large crowds.
Our ability to protect...
Mr. Vice President.
Is anything wrong?
We were just briefing Mrs. Underwood on our new security protocol.
Can we actually finish this later?
Of course.
How did it go?
He's skeptical.
Should I call Tricia?
No.
Could look like I was trying to go behind his back.
We'll just have to wait and see.
I made my case.
And hopefully he'll disagree with it.
This could have been the wrong move.
Well, don't doubt yourself.
Seth has gotten over 3,000 emails in the last six hours.
The phones are overloaded.
So you ignore all that.
I can't ignore the Department of Justice.
What can I do?
Come and visit me when I'm in prison.
You don't have to stand by that door.
Take a load off.
Thank you, sir, but I'm supposed to stay on my feet.
Well, I won't tell if you won't
And if anybody gives you any trouble about this, or anything, they can talk to me.
Beautiful night.
Yes, sir.
It's been strange not having you around these last few days.
You want me to switch back to your detail?
No, no.
I'm glad you're with Claire.
I just didn't realize how much I got used to your company until you were gone.
Protecting her is the same as protecting you in my mind.
Oh, come on.
Why do you do this?
Do what, sir?
I've always been awestruck.
People who are willing to take a bullet for someone else.
It's how I serve my country.
Well, there's a lot of ways to serve your country.
And this is my way.
Oh, I haven't finished with this one yet.
It's not for you.
I can't drink on duty, ma'am.
It's not for you either.
Well, come on over and join the party.
Haven't you got sick of seeing my face yet?
Never, ma'am.
To Meechum, for his loyalty and service.
To Edward.
I'm on my way to my lawyer's office, Remy.
That's not where I want to be when I'd usually be in bed.
I can't stop Frank from leaking things.
No, but you can make sure he suffers more than us.
And I say us, Remy, because your skin is in this game now, too.
Are you going to deny?
Of course I'm gonna deny.
Every step of this was legal.
They can't prove the links between them.
What about Lanagin?
He'll cooperate.
It's Feng we need to worry about.
I'll find a way to get in touch with him.
We do have one major advantage.
The public can hate me, but as long as Clayton West remains profitable, my stockholders won't care.
Frank doesn't have the same liberty.
Public opinion can demolish him.
You need to make sure that happens.
I could work with the Republicans on that.
They'll be under the magnifying glass, too.
This'll be a witch hunt.
Then I'll make sure that they pick the right targets.
What you need to do is go after the leadership.
Make them hurt.
They'll turn on Frank to save themselves.
Birch.
Womack.
Sharp.
Especially Jackie Sharp.
She's his chosen one.
Remy?
I heard you, yeah.
I got my marching orders.
I'm counting on you.
I'll deliver.
Let's talk in the morning.
The two names I like the most are
Justin Gaines and Heather Dunbar.
Gaines has better credentials.
But he's close to the administration.
We would've made him a federal judge if the GOP hadn't blocked it.
That's an important point.
Dunbar's got grit.
She's more than qualified.
And there's no baggage there.
But she's more unpredictable.
I doubt the Attorney General would have put her on his list if he thought she was a wild card.
Sir, I have to say, I think this step is premature.
We should hold off and see what the DOJ does on its own.
I don't want to do it, Bill.
But my fear is this, if we wait until the water goes from hot to boiling, we seem reactionary, not proactive.
But proactive could also seem defensive.
Like the suspect that screams
"I didn't do it" before anyone asks.
Aside from that, we simply haven't had time to prepare.
Maybe wait a couple of weeks.
No, that defeats the purpose.
Then a few days.
I'd like to go with Dunbar.
Sir...
I've made my decision.
Bill, I'd like you to convey my wishes to the Attorney General.
Ultimately the decision is his.
We can't appear to be pressuring.
Of course not.
Thank you, sir.
The only thing more satisfying than convincing someone to do what I want is failing to persuade them on purpose.
It's like a "do not enter" sign.
It just begs you to walk through the door.
Doyle's about halfway through our initial background check.
Every donor, every political event.
Anything that Dunbar might be looking into.
Good.
Seth?
We avoid any official statement.
Follow the President's cue.
In the meantime I'd like to make some off-the-record calls.
You welcome the investigation, it's the right step, et cetera.
Give folks the personal touch.
That's fine, as long as we don't come off defensive.
I'd like to see a list of who you'll be calling.
Some of this is gonna be on the fly.
It'd be great if I had a little leeway...
Yeah, let Seth do his thing.
You'll have your hands full with Doyle.
I'll let you know who I call.
All right.
Let's get to work.
Sir?
Yes, what is it?
I understand that you need to delegate.
But when you contradict me in front of Seth, it compromises my authority over him.
You can't micromanage.
We have too much to do.
Seth is still new to the team.
I need to make sure that he's doing his job properly.
Well, I think he is.
I am your failsafe, sir.
But I can't be that if you won't let me.
Are you, Doug?
My failsafe?
Do you doubt that?
We're flying full throttle into a hurricane, and you're talking office politics instead of focusing on making sure we don't get ripped apart.
You're right, sir.
I shouldn't have brought it up.
Is she still there?
Yeah.
I told her I was going for a walk.
Look, Doug, I know you said you wanted her gone, but you have to understand that all I'm asking...
She can stay.
What?
She doesn't have to leave.
She can stay.
I trust you to be smart.
Will you read to me?
My Bible is inside.
Doesn't have to be the Bible.
Just pull up something on your phone.
Like what?
Tale of Two Cities.
My mom used to read it to me.
"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,
"it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness,
"it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity,
"it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness,
"it was the spring of hope, the winter of despair,
"we had everything before us, we had nothing before us,
"we were all going direct to heaven,
"we were all going direct the other way..."
Hello?
Doug, is that you?
Hello?
Hello?
Doug...
Yes, Doug.
It is you.

Look at that, Cashew.
Someone's being a bad boy.
"Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour, and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice.
And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another."
Do you want me to keep going with this, or something else?
Doesn't matter to me.
I just like hearing you read it.
Doug, there's something I need to talk to you about.
You said that she was just staying for a few nights.
Her roommate kicked her out.
She doesn't have anywhere else to go.
- It's not our problem.
- I can't put her out on the street.
What's her name?
- Lisa.
- Lisa what?
You don't have anything to worry about.
- Where is she now?
- At the fellowship.
There's a sleepover with some of the kids from the day care.
Does she know about me?
No, I haven't told her anything.
I have given you space.
I trusted you, Rachel,
- and you've taken advantage...
- I'm not kicking her out.
- I could have said nothing, but I told you.
- I have to go.
She better be gone by the next time we talk.
- Sir.
- What took you so long?
I can have a briefing ready in five minutes.
Don't bother.
I had Seth do it.
He doesn't have security clearance.
Well, he does now.
Mr. President, after you.
I'll see you in my office.
Japanese sovereignty is a matter of precedent.
Mr. Prime Minister, my concern is escalation.
Well, I'm asking for a small portion of the 7th Fleet.
We must bring China into line.
Show them that the US and Japan maintain a strong alliance.
Have you reached out directly to Beijing?
No recognition that the island belongs to Japan.
Well, I'd like to speak to my team and formulate a plan.
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.
Admiral, for those catching up...
Two Chinese destroyers entered waters within three miles of Yonaguni Island here, approximately six hours ago.
See how close the island is to Taiwan.
This is different than the standoff over the Senkaku Islands.
It could have to do with shipping routes.
Or the trade war.
They can't pick on the big kids, so they're picking on the little one.
- Do you see that?
- What?
In the alley, camera two.
All posts, white male, hooded sweatshirt, duffel bag.
Southeast side of Fair St.
Put down the bag.
Put down the bag and place your hands on your head.
Stay right where you are.
Mrs. Underwood?
Will you come downstairs, please?
- Where's Francis?
- He got delayed at the White House, there was an emergency meeting.
- What's going on?
- I'll explain in the safe room.
The 7th Fleet is near Guam?
Ninety miles north.
We could have ships to Yonaguni in less than a week.
But even sending them in that direction will be picked up by the Chinese satellites.
Well, we have to stand with our allies, that can't be in question.
What if we don't send ships, just make a strong statement condemning their excursion into Japan's territorial waters.
We still have to offer the Chinese an incentive to call back their destroyers.
Whatever overtures we make, I'd like to have contingency plans in place.
- Already drafting them, sir.
- Cathy, open up a diplomatic channel with Beijing.
See if there's a concrete ask, if they don't have one, let's create a list of options.
- Right away, sir.
- How about coordination with the Japanese navy?
Go.
Don't engage with our navy yet.
I want to talk directly to Prime Minister Oshiro and express our intentions.
Former marine.
He showed up at the outer perimeter with explosives in a duffel bag.
- And strapped to his body.
- Jesus.
We apprehended him, the press isn't aware.
- Well, let's keep it that way.
- He claimed he was responsible for sending the package of white powder to the capitol.
So this time he really wanted to take me out for real.
Not exactly.
His wife got an abortion last week without telling him.
- Oh, my God.
It was me.
- Yes, you were the target.
We'd like to keep you down here with us, Mrs. Underwood,
- until we confirm he was acting alone.
- I'll stay.
No, you have to get back to the White House.
- I can work from here.
- Francis, I'm fine.
Honestly.
I'm just gonna be in here.
I want you to stick with her at all times.
Keep me informed of everything.
He's almost done with his shift, sir.
I can put another agent on...
- No, I want it to be Meechum.
- Absolutely, sir.
As long as necessary.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
It's OK.
Don't go to California.
Mm...
Be nice to be reelected.
You're gonna win.
Not if I don't give the voters more face time.
When did you get it?
- The Army?
- Yeah.
It's grown since then.
Tell me about it.
No.
Why not?
I don't want to.
What are you doing?
Tell me about the tattoo.
- That's not fair.
- So what?
You think you can just get me wet and I'll spill everything?
- I don't think so...
- Mm I know so.
Tell me.
I like the pain.
- Of the needle?
- Yeah.
How bad did it hurt?
It hurt a lot.
You like when it hurts?
I killed a lot of people.
What?
In the Army.
The pain it helped.
Finish.
The most I could find was some wrangling with the EPA when he opened his first plant, but that was almost 40 years ago.
- We need more.
I want Tusk gone.
- Doyle and I will keep looking.
If you haven't found anything now, what makes you think you will?
Maybe we missed something.
I doubt it, but we could try.
You think Tusk isn't planning his next attack even as we speak?
We've been thorough, sir.
He doesn't leave footprints.
You want to shift tactics?
The casino.
We go public as soon as possible.
You said that was a last resort.
Seth, you need to find a way to make that happen so it doesn't link to us.
If we launch that missile, it could blow us up too.
Not if we spin it right.
- If we keep the focus on...
- Seth.
You're here to listen, not contribute.
I wouldn't have him here if I didn't want him to contribute.
Sir... he's been sitting with this for three hours.
I've been working on it for three months.
And accomplished nothing.
It's time we go on the offensive.
- What do you think?
- Ayla Sayyad.
- She's already digging into Tusk and Feng.
- How close is she?
She never mentioned a casino, but now that I know what the dots are,
I can see that she's starting to connect them.
The Pentagon isn't talking yet.
I imagine they're waiting on the White House.
I hear there have been regular meetings in the Situation Room since last night.
Let me call you right back.
- Hello?
- Hey, Lynne, it's Ayla.
- I just sent you a picture.
- Yeah, I got it.
- What does it mean?
- It's strange, it doesn't make sense.
- Tell me. - "Pursue currency" would be the most literal translation.
Or "pursue money."
- Follow the money?
- That could work.
Thanks, Lynne.
I like what you've done.
This sofa, it's new?
- These lamps as well?
- I've made a few changes.
You get so used to a place, the smallest things stand out.
I apologize for not being responsive sooner.
I've been focused on the midterms.
Oh, there's no need to explain.
Mrs. Underwood, you know how much I respect your intentions, but I've thought deeply about this and
I can't cosponsor the bill in its current form.
Civilian oversight is too extreme a step, but I'd be happy to revisit some of the other less extreme proposals.
You think we're being extremist?
I want to help with this issue, but this bill goes through...
This bill is through Armed Services.
This bill has a date on the floor.
Almost every woman in the House supports this bill.
- And I can't be one of them.
- So you lied to us.
I didn't lie.
I didn't lie.
I...
I want to help.
As long as we rethink some of the language.
Are you trying to distance yourself from us because of the Galloway scandal?
- No.
- Maybe you think it hurts your chances
- of reelection if you associate with me.
- That's not it.
It's because I honestly don't believe in this approach.
Do you realize the message this sends?
The only woman in congressional leadership in both parties, and you bow out?
If the bill goes to the floor as is, I won't just bow out.
I'll actively fight it.
You never asked my position.
You assumed.
I can't imagine what that position must be.
I've served in war zones, I know firsthand how important...
We're not talking about war zones.
We're talking about sexual assault.
How about a military commission to review the internal...
We don't need more studies, we need reform.
Well, let's continue this conversation when I return from California.
I'll be back the day after tomorrow if you change your mind.
I won't, but I hope you change yours.
China was insulted at the notion that we could buy them off.
Do I need to call President Qian?
I doubt he would contradict one of his ministers.
See if he's willing to talk one-on-one.
You should know, sir, Japan is also preparing to deploy three destroyers and a light cruiser.
They're upping the ante.
Have Ambassador Hines get in touch with the prime minister, and ask if Japan will hold off until I make contact with Beijing.
Yes, sir.
Have you gotten any rest at all?
- No, have you?
- No, not yet.
How's Claire?
Secret Service thinks it's an isolated attempt, but they're being cautious.
After the Galloway thing and the interview, half the country thinks she's a baby killer, or an adulterer, or both.
But Claire's taking it in stride.
We're in good hands.
That's very frightening.
I can see why you haven't slept.
One of us should, probably the one that's calling all the shots.
No, I can hold out a little while longer.
No, go to the residence, spend some time with your wife.
You'll come back feeling like a new man.
Honestly, it's less stressful here.
- Counseling hasn't helped?
- No, it has... slowly.
- I got rid of Christina when Linda resigned.
- I heard.
It's improved things some, but there's still work to do.
Makes me tired just to think about it.
Well, you probably wouldn't be the first president to get a little shut-eye on one of these sofas.
- I was joking.
- I wasn't.
Do the free world a favor and get some rest.
- I'll let you be.
- No, stick around.
You should be nearby if President Qian wants to get on the phone.
I've always loathed the necessity of sleep.
Like death, it puts the most powerful men on their backs.
DC Limo and Bus Rental.
I'm calling from the Adohi Casino's travel department.
We've got a corporate account.
Let's see...
I'm sorry, we don't have one in our records.
My mistake.
I must've called the wrong limo service.
Thank you.
Missouri Bus and Limo.
I'm calling from the Adohi Casino's travel department.
- You're not Darlene.
- No, Darlene is out sick.
I'm filling in for her.
My name is Pam.
How can I help you, Pam?
We've got a flight coming in from China tomorrow.
We'll need some transportation.
How many you got coming?
I don't have the manifest right in front of me.
- The usual?
- That's right.
- So a luxury bus.
- How many does that fit?
Fifty-five, usually about 20 come in.
Should be plenty of room.
That's great, thanks.
Do you think it's really her conscience, or because the bill's controversial?
I don't think she would have threatened to fight us if all she wanted to do was avoid controversy.
I'll talk to her.
I really want this bill to pass.
I know you do, so do I.
We need Jackie more than ever, Francis.
I'm damaged goods, this whole Adam thing.
No, you're not.
We fought past that.
Well, there's plenty of people who still believe it's true.
We'll get it passed, I promise.
- No, thanks.
- Come on.
It's no fun doing it alone.
We could just go for a run.
No more runs until the death threats die down, that's the new rule.
But they let you go to the office.
Because I was in a bulletproof car.
Does this mean we've officially not quit?
We've never been quitters, have we?
Sir, Mrs. Underwood, sorry to interrupt.
I was gonna head home, but I'll stick around if you want me to.
Oh, no.
You've been up long enough.
Get some sleep.
I'll be back first thing in the morning.
Thank you for looking after me today.
My pleasure, ma'am.
Sir, Mrs. Underwood.
- He's very dedicated.
- He is.
It's rare to find someone like Edward.
- What?
- You never use his first name.
Oh, did I?
I don't feel right talking about her like this.
It's just... technically, she's my boss now.
- There's a certain protocol.
- This is coming directly from Doug.
Which means it's coming directly from the vice president.
Well, um, I have seen Mr. Danton around from time to time.
Do you know what he and the congresswoman were discussing?
No, they were private meetings.
Do you have the appointment schedule?
I'd like to look at the dates.
These weren't formal appointments.
He just stops by.
Most of the time pretty late at night.
Did the money originate in China?
The money came from tribal revenue.
As our FEC reports clearly stated.
Let me rephrase.
Did any of that revenue come from Chinese visitors who gambled at your casino?
We have visitors from all over the world.
I'm speaking specifically about a businessman named Xander Feng.
I have no idea who that is.
I'm looking at FAA flight records that show a private plane he owns making numerous trips to Kansas City.
And I spoke with Missouri Bus and Limo, which has transported Chinese visitors to your casino.
- Ms. Said...
- Sayyad.
Ms. Sayyad, the only reason I returned your call was because you work for The Telegraph.
It's not every day that I get a call from a paper as big as yours.
But I don't know what you're trying to get at here, so if you'll excuse...
What about Raymond Tusk?
- What about him?
- Feng has ties to Tusk.
Tusk has ties to the president.
You have ties to Feng.
That looks like foreign money being used to influence political...
What you're insinuating is not only wrong,
- it's libelous.
- Not if it's true.
I won't bat an eyelash getting my attorneys involved.
Tusk made the same threat.
If a man worth 40 billion dollars doesn't intimidate me, you certainly don't, Mr. Lana...
Hello?
He hung up.
I had nothing to do with it, Raymond.
I can smell the horseshit through the phone.
You think I'd put myself at this great a risk?
Desperate men are capable of anything.
- I want it to go away, just like you do.
- Then pull her back.
I have no control over the press, Raymond.
You'll destroy yourself, Frank, not me.
Thank you for that unsolicited advice.
Work with Doyle, make sure we have no weak spots.
- I'll call him now.
- What did Nancy say?
Well, it looks like Jackie may be sleeping with the enemy.
Lanagin is correct in saying we run the risk of libel.
These links are supported by fact.
Individually, but you can't complete the circle.
I'm not saying the headline should read:
Money Laundering Scheme Exposed!
Just that we present the landscape as we currently know it.
We're first and foremost a financial paper.
Many of our readers worship Raymond Tusk.
So we just protect him?
We don't insinuate connections we can't back up.
If there's any basis for litigation, you can be sure his team will be aggressive.
They've bankrupted papers before.
I think you should slow down and take your time.
When, and if, you have a story...
Mr. Maxfield, Raymond Tusk is on the line.
- Did you put in a call to him?
- Yesterday.
He's specifically asking for you, sir.
We got off the phone with Lanagin less than 30 minutes ago.
That means Tusk was the first call Lanagin made.
Tell him I'll return.
Did you reach out to the White House?
They're not talking to anyone until after the president does his press briefing tomorrow.
All right, walk me through all of this again, point by point.
- Meechum.
- We can talk tomorrow, sir.
No.
What is it?
I'd like to put in a request to be on your wife's detail full time.
At least until the death threats quiet down.
That's very thoughtful.
I'll only do it if you approve, sir.
- Have you spoken to Claire?
- When she came home.
- She likes the idea.
- Then I think we should do it.
I'll let Agent Rockland know.
Sorry for interrupting you, sir.
You didn't interrupt anything.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Meechum.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You'll never believe what just happened.
- What?
- Meechum came into the office and found me watching something...
- ...other than the news.
- Oh!
- Oh, no.
- He was very professional about it.
- Were you...?
- No, no.
I was just watching.
That's really funny.
What about you?
What are you watching?
The video Connor gave me.
It's our first state senate race.
I forgot about that.
So did I, until I found it in the desk this morning.
Let me see.
...been there, like I have.
Of course, it doesn't hurt to have a little Texas in them...
My God, look how young we are.
I know.
Everyone here has been so kind, and so welcoming.
We'll have her rooting for Clemson before too long.
That's where I have to draw the line.
Do you miss being with Adam?
Where did that come from?
Miss it?
No.
Well, you must, sometimes.
He meant a lot to me for a while.
But that's done now.
What about you?
What about me?
Are you unsatisfied?
There's just too much at stake now.
No one we can trust.
We don't have the freedom we once did.
Maybe it's better this way.
No room for distractions.
I don't mind the sacrifice.
We chose this instead.
I think the one thing we can agree on is the ribs here are better.
See, he's just trying to get under my skin.
No, it's not even debatable...
- How was California?
- Oh...
Exhausting.
Twelve events in two days.
- Is this the Golden Gate?
- Yes.
I had an etching right there.
The capitol before it was finished.
Took 85 years to complete it.
- How long did it take to complete the bridge?
- About four years.
It opened a few months after FDR's second inaugural.
There was a man who got things done.
Strong beliefs and he stuck to them.
But compromised when he had to.
I assume you're here to talk about Claire's bill.
It's not a pet project.
There are three dozen cosponsors on either side of the aisle.
- It's a serious bill.
- I don't disagree.
- Except with the language.
- I can explain my thinking, but I doubt I'll convince you anymore...
Putting aside the military's honor, chain of command, all the things that you hold dear let's consider one simple fact.
You wouldn't have this office if it weren't for me.
I made very clear that I wouldn't be a puppet.
I'm not trying to pull strings, but you could show a little gratitude.
If it were anything else, Mr. Vice President... but not this.
All you're doing is making the inevitable more difficult.
It's not inevitable.
Claire doesn't have the votes yet.
You really want to fight us on this.
I don't want to fight you at all.
Which is why I suggested to Claire that we sit down...
I neither have the time nor the inclination to negotiate with you!
Cosponsor the bill, whip the damn votes, I'm no longer asking.
Then I'm no longer listening.
You don't have just this office to thank me for.
If you win reelection, you can thank me for that, too.
Those attack ads didn't just disappear on their own.
- What do you mean?
- Why don't you ask Remy Danton.
And ask him about Raymond Tusk while you're at it.
That ought to make for some very interesting pillow talk.
You keep up the good work, Nancy.
I will, Mr. Vice President.
I miss having you around, but you're my eyes and ears now, otherwise I'd steal you back in a heartbeat.
Well, thank you, sir.
It means a lot to me that you say that.
- Doug?
- I'm busy.
The story just broke.
They timed it with the president's press conference.
Connect me with the vice president.
So the 7th Fleet is currently positioned near Guam, where it will remain if China removes its ships from Japan's sovereign waters.
I've been in frequent touch with prime minister Oshiro, and have made personal overtures to President Qian.
And I remain optimistic that tensions will be quelled without any further escalations.
So, with that, I'll take some questions.
- Henry, you first.
- Can you comment on the Wall Street Telegraph article...
I was just notified of that moments before I joined you.
I haven't had a chance to read it yet.
Yeah, Jane.
Mr. President, would you walk us through your history with Raymond Tusk?
I'm here to answer questions on Sino-Japanese relations.
Mark.
The article mentions Xander Feng, a wealthy and influential Chinese business...
Unless this has to do with the statement I just made...
It does, Mr. President.
Feng has ties to the standing committee and we're currently in a standoff with the Chinese.
Economically...
Thank you all very much.
It's not beginning the story that I fear, it's not knowing how it will end.
Everyone is fair game now, including me.
This is par for the course, what we've come to expect from President Walker.
Whenever he's selling a shiny new car, he can't say enough about it.
The engine breaks down, the transmission gives out, he dodges, he ignores the warranty.
I'm gonna tell you something, our warranty is the Constitution of the United States, and there's no limit on that.
He needs to read the fine print and start answering our questions.
If any of this is true, we're talking Congress, the White House, both parties...
Now, I'm saying "if,"
but when it look like dirty money, and it smells like dirty money, somebody has probably got dirt under their nails.
Look, there's no real proof this money laundering is even...
The connections are troubling, especially Underwood.
He was the House whip the entire time Adohi were contributing to the Democrats, and he's working side by side with the president now.
The president.
So this goes all the way to the White House?
- It might.
- It's hypothetical.
And by the way, you've cherry-picked the facts to make your case.
I'm not making a case.
PAC Money Raises Questions.
And it has.
I haven't answered those questions, but I think the American people deserve answers.
Don't you?
You can bet your bottom dollar the attorney general is gonna investigate.
- With the firestorm this is causing in the media...
- What's our course of action?
As your counsel, I would encourage you not to speak to the press until we have more information.
As your average citizen, the longer you wait, the more suspicious it looks.
If there's been any irregularity, I had nothing to do with it.
Your friendship with Tusk implies guilt by association.
Are we presuming guilt before innocence?
I'm a lawyer, I presume nothing.
But public opinion doesn't have a law degree.
Give us a few moments.
I have to advise you not to have any conversation about this matter
- without me present.
- Your advisement has been noted.
I'll be right outside.
Is this what you were keeping from me?
We should follow your counsel's advice
- and not...
- Tell me if it's true, about the money.
With Bill out of the room, we open ourselves up to...
Damn it, Frank!
I've been in the dark too long on this.
That ends now.
I don't know any details.
Feng told me if the Bridge project got approved, the GOP would stop getting money.
We approved it, the money stopped.
Jesus Christ, that connects the White House directly to the money.
No, sir.
You knew nothing, you still know nothing.
If the DOJ finds any concrete evidence of foreign money...
That's Raymond Tusk's head, not yours.
You've done nothing wrong.
Guilt by association, Frank.
You heard the man.
If the DOJ investigates, it will only prove your innocence.
Nobody walks away from something like this without bruises.
Well, bruises you can survive.
I just don't know how we can avoid it at this point.
Unless you want to accelerate the process and get rid of it.
We could always have the attorney general appoint a special prosecutor.
- That's a terrible idea.
- Maybe so.
And given where we are, Frank, I'm not inclined to follow your suggestions.
Well, I wasn't suggesting it was something you should do.
Just as a possibility.
No, in fact, I don't think you should.
I think it's better to drag these things out as long as possible.
- Let the public fatigue on it.
- And have it hanging over our heads until the midterms?
- It'll lose steam.
- What if it doesn't.
I've got the Pentagon proposing tactical drone strikes in the South China Sea.
I can't be dealing with something like this for months on end.
Maybe you're right then.
A special prosecutor is the way to go.
I didn't say that, you did.
Oh, no.
I just meant in terms of getting it off your plate.
It wouldn't be on my plate if you kept me better informed.
I have done nothing but try to insulate you, sir.
Is that what you call the feeding frenzy I just went through?
I make this solemn promise to you, Mr. President.
I will take the fall if it comes to that, but it won't.
However you decide to deal with this, I think your instincts are right.
We probably shouldn't involve a special prosecutor.
Send Bill back in.
You knew about this.
Tusk is a client, doesn't mean I know everything...
Bullshit.
The reason you're a partner at Glendon Hill is because you know the things nobody else does.
What do you want me to say?
- Is it true?
- We don't talk about work.
We're not in bed, we're in my fucking office.
And in here, you work for Frank.
- I work for no one but myself.
- Keep telling yourself that.
Unlike you, I don't peddle my goods for whoever can pay the highest retainer.
I'm the bitch to a lot of top dogs, I'm fully aware and willing, but you're worse.
You're Frank's bitch and refuse to believe it.
- That's not true.
- Case in fucking point.
Don't turn this.
You knew about the money and you didn't tell me.
Even though it's thrown my seat into contention.
Let's say there was money, and let's say I did know,
- what good would it have done?
- It means you were willing to watch me lose!
It means I respected the boundaries that you demanded.
- No changes, no special treatment.
- This is different!
- So now we're making exceptions?
- When it's this important, yes!
You can't have it both ways.
Were you...?
Was I what?
...fucking me to get info on Frank?
- Is that what you think?
- I don't know what to think.
I care about you more than I should.
But I'm getting tired of having to say it.
He's being moved to a federal psychiatric facility for assessment.
Then a high security detention center until the official sentencing.
Well, that's good to hear.
The bad news is we don't want you doing any public events for a while.
My bill's about to go to the floor.
I need to have a public profile.
Your death threats continue to rise.
We can't take the risk.
- Am I even allowed to leave the house?
- Of course.
But we want you to avoid large crowds.
Our ability to protect...
Mr. Vice President.
- Anything wrong?
- We were just briefing Mrs. Underwood on her new security protocol.
- Can we actually finish this later?
- Of course.
How did it go?
- He's skeptical.
- Should I call Tricia?
No.
It could look like I was trying to go behind his back.
We'll just have to wait and see.
I made my case.
Hopefully, he'll disagree with it.
But this could've been the wrong move.
Well, don't doubt yourself.
Seth has gotten over 3,000 e-mails in the last six hours.
- The phones are overloaded.
- So you ignore all that?
I can't ignore the Department of Justice.
What can I do?
Come and visit me when I'm in prison.
You don't have to stand by that door.
Take a load off.
Thank you, sir, but I'm supposed to stay on my feet.
Well, I won't tell if you won't.
And if anybody gives you any trouble about this, or anything, they can talk to me.
- Beautiful night.
- Yes, sir.
It's been strange not having you around these last few days.
You want me to switch back to your detail?
No, no.
I'm glad you're with Claire.
I just didn't realize how much I got used to your company until you were gone.
Protecting her is the same as protecting you, in my mind.
Oh, come on.
- Why do you do this?
- Do what, sir?
I've always been awestruck, people who are willing to take a bullet for someone else.
- That's how I serve my country.
- Well, there's a lot of ways to serve your country.
And this is my way.
- I haven't finished with this one yet.
- It's not for you.
I can't drink on duty, ma'am.
It's not for you either.
Well, come on over and join the party.
Haven't you got sick of seeing my face yet?
Never, ma'am.
To Meechum, for his loyalty and service.
To Edward.
I'm on my way to my lawyer's office, Remy.
That's not where I want to be when I'd usually be in bed.
I can't stop Frank from leaking things.
No, but you can make sure he suffers more than us.
And I say "us," Remy, because your skin is in this game now, too.
- Are you gonna deny?
- Of course I'm gonna deny.
Every step of this was legal.
They can't prove the links between them.
- What about Lanagin?
- He'll cooperate.
It's Feng we need to worry about.
I'll find a way to get in touch with him.
We do have one major advantage.
The public can hate me, but as long as Clayton West remains profitable, my stockholders won't care.
Frank doesn't have the same liberty.
Public opinion can demolish him.
You need to make sure that happens.
I can work with the Republicans on that.
Well, we'll be under the magnifying glass too.
This will be a witch hunt.
I'll make sure that they pick the right targets.
What you need to do is go after the leadership.
Make them hurt.
They'll turn on Frank to save themselves.
Birch, Womack, Sharp.
Especially Jackie Sharp.
She's his chosen one.
- Remy?
- I heard you.
I got my marching orders.
- I'm counting on you.
- I'll deliver.
Let's talk in the morning.
The two names I like the most are Justin Gaines and Heather Dunbar.
Gaines has better credentials.
But he's close to the administration.
I would've made him a federal judge if the GOP hadn't blocked it.
That's an important point.
Dunbar's got grit.
- She's more than qualified.
- No baggage there?
- She's more unpredictable.
- I doubt the attorney general would've put her on his list if he thought she was a wild card.
Sir, I have to say, I think this step is premature.
We should hold off and see what the DOJ does on its own.
I don't want to do it, Bill, but my fear is this:
if we wait until the water goes from hot to boiling, we seem reactionary, not proactive.
But proactive could also seem defensive.
Like the suspect that screams "I didn't do it" before anyone asks.
Aside from that, we simply haven't had time to prepare.
- Maybe wait a couple of weeks.
- That defeats the purpose.
- Then a few days.
- I'd like to go with Dunbar.
- Sir...
- I've made my decision.
Bill, I'd like you to convey my wishes to the attorney general.
Ultimately, the decision is his.
We can't appear to be pressuring him.
- Of course not.
- Thank you, sir.
The only thing more satisfying than convincing someone to do what I want, is failing to persuade them on purpose.
It's like a "Do Not Enter" sign, it just begs you to walk through the door.
Doyle's about halfway through our initial background check.
Every donor, every political event.
Everything that Dunbar might be looking into.
- Good.
Seth?
- We avoid any official statement, follow the president's cue.
In the meantime, I'd like to make some off the record calls.
You welcome the investigation, it's the right step, et cetera.
Give folks the personal touch.
That's fine, as long as we don't come off defensive.
I'd like to see a list of who you'd be calling.
Some of this is gonna be on the fly, it'd be great if I had a little leeway.
Let Seth do his thing, you'll have your hands full with Doyle.
I'll let you know who I've called.
All right, let's get to work.
Sir?
Yes, what is it?
I understand that you need to delegate, but when you contradict me in front of Seth, it compromises my authority over him.
You can't micromanage, we have too much to do.
Seth is still new to the team.
I need to make sure that he's doing his job properly.
- Well, I think he is.
- I'm your fail-safe, sir.
But I can't be that if you won't let me.
Are you, Doug?
- My failsafe?
- Do you doubt that?
We're flying full throttle into a hurricane, and you're talking office poilitics instead of focusing on making sure we don't get ripped apart.
You're right, sir.
I shouldn't have brought it up.
- Is she still there?
- Yeah.
I told her I was going for a walk.
Look, Doug, I know you said you wanted her gone, but you have to understand...
She can stay.
- What?
- She doesn't have to leave, she can stay.
I trust you to be smart.
Will you read to me?
- My Bible's inside.
- Doesn't have to be the Bible.
Just pull up something on your phone.
- Like what?
- A Tale of Two Cities.
My mom used to read it to me.
"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom,
it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope,
it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way."
Hello?
Doug, is that you?
Hello?
Hello?
Doug?
Yes, Doug, it is you.
Synced and corrected by TVfreak83
Excuse me.
Yes.
I want you off this beach now, please.
Have a bit of respect, all right?
It's not a sight for children is it?
Some people!
Bob, Bob, I want these people off that pier, all right?
I want the whole pier cleared.
Can you move off the pier, please?
Quickly now!
Sorry, we're moving.
We're moving on.
Thank you.
Hello there.
Hiya.
Is she on her own?
Yeah.
My name's John.
Are you all right?
Where's your mummy and daddy?
They're asleep.
Asleep?
So did you bring out the dog for a walk on your own?
Do you know what, if you were my little lass,
I wouldn't let you out of my sight.
ICE-CREAM VAN JINGLE PLAYS
I'd also buy you a big fat massive ice cream...
I think it might be a little bit too early.
What do you think?
No, it's not!
No, not too early?
Come on then, let's go and get one.
There we go.
Morning, Sir.
Nice day for it.
About 16 to 17 by the looks of it.
She's no ID, but there's a massive blow to the side of the head.
Think she was dead before she hit the water.
She's wearing a Bluebird Holiday Camp uniform.
Can't have been in the water very long.
Time of death is...
Oh, I dunno, some time today, early hours of the morning, something like that.
What do you think?
You all right?
Get her in.
Right, I'll get the lads.
All right, let's get her in.
Any witnesses?
Not yet, no.
Old fella said he saw a young couple down here last night.
Could've been her...
With a bloke - things get out of hand, you know.
Description fit?
Not really, no.
Was dark though.
Is that all you've got?
Give us a chance, sir, will you?
You searched the pier?
What?
The pier.
Have you searched the pier?
No, not yet.
Something tells me that the beach is the priority, Guv.
And something tells me you've not heard of longshore drift.
That body travelled inland.
You'd dump her at the furthest point, of course, closest to the open sea - gives her a better chance of drifting away.
But you'd be very wrong cos the current would just take her straight round, right where she was found.
A pier at night can house all sorts.
Meaning?
It's more private than the beach.
Perfect for an illicit night-time stroll, over the waves.
Very romantic.
Sounds like you've been there and done that.
I might have known a late-night stroll along the pier in my time, John.
Really?
I don't have you down as a man who likes it al fresco.
Now, there's a line.
And I just crossed it.
You've just...
Yeah, absolutely.
Sorry.
I want every inch of this pier searched.
All right.
Sorry.
Bluebird's eh?
Yeah.
Bluebird's three or four miles that way.
We went there, you know, me and Lisa.
Did you?
Mmm, a few years back.
It was good.
Just after Leigh-Anne was born.
We went to a holiday camp right after the war.
Never seen so many families in one place, you know, enjoying themselves for the first time.
A whole new world.
BACCHUS SIGHS
Are you missing Leigh-Anne?
Yeah.
I've not seen her for three week.
Can you believe that?
That's not enough, is it?
No, it's not enough.
I'm fine when I'm not thinking about her.
You know, I'm fine then.
But you think about her all the time.
Yeah.
Isabel!
Sorry.
Welcome to Bluebird!
Can I help you, gentlemen?
Wives powdering their noses in the car, and children causing mischief after a long drive, I'll bet?
Let me get someone to help you with your bags.
No, thank you.
I'm DCI Gently.
Could we speak to the manager, please?
Of course.
Well, would you like a lift?
No, thank you.
We'll walk.
I'll show you the way.
Go!
One, two, three, four, five, six...
FAIRGROUND ORGAN PLAYS
Sorry to disturb, Miss Stretch, these gentlemen wish to see Mr Stretch.
They're policeman.
Thank you, Justine.
Detective Chief Inspector Gently.
Cherry.
This is Detective Sergeant Bacchus.
My brother Todd shouldn't be long.
It's all a bit manic here today.
The body of a young woman was found this morning.
We believe that she worked here.
Obviously we're very anxious to identify her.
Anyone missing?
I'm...
I'm sorry?
Body was found on the beach near the pier.
Why do you think she worked here?
She wore a Bluebird uniform.
Right.
Anyone missing, to your knowledge?
Well...
I don't know.
Staff rotas aren't really my thing.
Might need to try harder than that.
All my workers live on site.
There's a late-comers board.
If someone hasn't clocked in, then their name get's chalked up.
Good.
Shall we?
Hello, Mr Stretch.
Sophie.
Sally.
Do you live on site, Mr Stretch?
No.
I live at home with my wife and two daughters.
I'm very lucky.
Business good?
Chin up, Lottie.
Oh, yes.
We are a powerhouse, gentlemen - built from dust.
But a few loans started my father off, and he opened the doors in '36.
No-one had ever seen anything quite like it.
Family holidays for the masses.
We've been full to bursting ever since.
You know there is a great pleasure in having to turn punters away.
Here we are.
Ah, Megan.
Blue for Bluebird?
Yes.
Does she live with anybody, share a room?
Justine Leyland, I believe.
Senior Bluebird.
We've met her already.
Ah, yes.
She's been scooping up the new arrivals, and hurling them into a dance competition to whet their appetite.
I think the Bluebirds will be arriving in the dance hall now.
Thank you.
Inspector?
Yes.
Now, we can keep all this a little...
low, can't we?
I'm sorry?
People are on their holidays.
Yes?
Well, this is a camp of smiles.
It's a holiday from their grey little lives.
We don't want a gloomy little storm cloud gathering.
Are you asking us to protect your business, Mr Stretch?
Simply asking for a little discretion.
I don't think you've quite got it yet, have you?
A member of your staff has been found dead.
We need staff rotas, the names of everybody who was working last night.
Oh, and the guests.
Of course.
We need the names of all the guests.
Dance hall, you said?
"Helpless" by Kim Weston
I'm happy to be the girl if you fancy a dance.
No, you're all right, thank you very much.
Lisa and I won this, you know.
Did you?
Won the cup in this very room.
She's a good mover is Lisa.
Really cracking little dancer.
I mean, she wouldn't have won the cup without me.
Is that right?
Yeah.
Fred Astaire of the North-East, me.
Look at the moves.
Quality.
Well, much as I'd like to stand here and admire your... fluidity.
Well done, campers!
Wow, are you all trained or something?
They said that when we were here.
So, the dance competition is now closed, so now we have the Bluebird Boppers while our judges make their decision and it won't be long till this little cup get's given to one lucky family.
Could we have a word, please?
Inspector?
Somewhere quieter.
So, ladies and gentlemen, a big hand for the Bluebird Boppers!
CHEERING
So, your cabin mate Megan Webb...
What about her?
She didn't come to work this morning.
Yeah, well, she's always late.
She'll stroll in any minute looking immaculate.
Do you share a cabin?
There's three of us.
Who's the third?
Gail.
Little kitchen maid.
Buried in chip fat, as we speak, lucky old thing.
When's the last time that you saw Megan?
Be last night, on stage.
She'd finished after the first show.
Did she come back here at all last night?
No.
Was she meeting anybody?
Well, she didn't say she was.
What's going on?
We're just making some enquiries.
Really?
Two plain-clothes detectives?
We've found a body - a girl.
She was wearing a Bluebird uniform.
Long blonde hair, very pretty.
No!
What was Megan wearing when you saw her last?
Er...
Her uniform.
She'd just finished her shift.
Was that the last time you saw her?
I told you, she didn't come back last night.
You didn't report her?
I'm her friend, so, no.
That's what we do.
She's got enough black marks next to her name as it is.
Did she have a boyfriend?
Not that I know of.
Are you sure?
I told you, I don't know.
Well, thank you, you'll want to be getting back to announce those winners.
Until we've spoken to the family, got a positive ID...
You want me to keep me mouth shut.
Well, it might not be her.
Yeah, but it might.
Yeah.
"Heaven Must Have Sent You" by Bonnie Pointer
Lisa, it's me.
Yeah.
Listen,
I was wondering if I could see Leigh-Anne this weekend?
I know it's not my weekend.
Right.
No, no, I can't wait three weeks.
It's not fair.
Why?
I know what the agreement is, Lisa.
Once a month's not enough, it's nowhere near, it's not even close.
No, no, I'm her dad, Lisa.
I'm her dad!
And I only get to see her 12 times a year.
12- it's ridiculous!
No, listen...
I don't think you realise how ridi...
Oh, you stupid...!
She hung up on us.
Can you believe that?
Must be your softly-softly approach, John.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means easy does it.
Come on.
Pathology report's back.
John?
Huh?
Sorry, go on.
No sign of rape, or sexual assault.
She wasn't a virgin.
And no water in the lungs.
Well, that means she'd have been dead when she hit the water, doesn't it?
Very.
It'd only been there a few hours.
Time of death was between eight and ten on Saturday evening.
It'd have been busy in the pier, Saturday night.
I don't think she died on the pier, John.
I think she was killed somewhere else, kept there for eight or so hours, and then taken to the pier, dumped over the side.
Somebody hoped that she would just drift away without a trace.
That's a bit stupid, that, isn't it?
Yeah, very.
What happens now?
Well, can we drive you home?
I've got the car.
Don't you want to talk to us?
We can do that later.
I want to do it now.
Agnes...
Well, what are we going to do?
Go home, chop some vegetables, put the radio on?
Darling...
Inspector?
She told us at dinner... .. about the job at the camp.
It was my birthday.
I'd made a quiche Lorraine.
One always hopes that someone else will cook on your birthday, but not this time.
Megan!
On the table!
Megan!
Megan.
Patrick, did you polish both serving spoons?
Yes, I think so...
You think?
I'll do it.
When you ask if you can help, dear, and then don't do the very thing that I ask, there really is very little point, is there?
Have we got any butter?
There's already butter on the potatoes.
I'd like to put a bit more on.
You heard your mother, you don't need any more.
I'd like some more, please.
Run along and get it then.
We'll wait till you return.
I've got a job at the Bluebird Holiday Camp.
And so it began.
She left when?
The following morning.
She was resolute.
She took the bus.
The blue one, with the flaky upholstery.
When was this?
About two months ago.
And you haven't seen her since?
No.
Did you visit her at the camp?
No.
Thank you, Rachel.
Was this new, this desire to break free?
The last two years have been rather disruptive, Inspector.
Cos we... we moved, from London to Newcastle - from a dear little house in Richmond.
Nice neighbours, everything just as we wanted it.
And Patrick got a promotion up here.
He's from Newcastle, you see.
And then after the move,
Megan did become perhaps a little surly, but then she did have dreams of achieving something which was just beyond the realms of possibility.
What was that?
She wanted to become an actress, a performer.
You didn't approve?
It's a wildly frivolous occupation, Inspector, bound in... .. uncertainty and self-indulgence and those who really need it are fragile creatures, in my opinion.
"Look at me!" Isn't that what it's saying?
Perhaps.
Was she good at it?
What?
Megan, was she any good?
Was she a good performer?
I've no idea.
But the notion of her wanting to get a job at the camp to achieve her dreams was quite frankly laughable.
Why was that?
The Bluebird Holiday Camp is hardly the Royal Shakespeare Company, is it?
It's a playground for those with less than Patrick and I.
We prefer to holiday at Whitby.
Wonderful steam train.
I love steam trains.
Did she contact you after she got to the camp or while she was there?
She wrote.
Once.
Can we see it, that letter?
I don't have it.
I saw no reason to keep it.
Was she precious to you, your daughter?
What sort of a question is that?
Well, parents don't usually throw away their children's letters, do they?
Especially if they haven't seen them for a few weeks, their only daughter.
She was enjoying being amongst all those campers, enjoying the hysteria.
I saw no reason to read that letter more than once.
Right, one more question.
What were you both doing last night?
What, pray, are you suggesting?
Just answer the question, please.
We went to the theatre.
At the village hall.
Amateur dramatic production of Kiss Me Kate - it was rather good.
Thank you.
I'd run away to a holiday camp if that was the alternative.
Indeed.
She didn't seem very upset, did she?
Visibly unmoved, I'd say.
Methodical.
Taut.
We'd better check their alibi.
I could do that.
All right.
I've got it.
You still here?
I'm compartmentalising.
What?
Well, er, your filing system is, um, questionable...
Sir.
Is it now?
No, it's not.
It's not?
No.
Well, you see, Detective Sergeant, I would be interested in your definition of an operational filing system when there appears to be a lack of any files.
It's all right.
It's all there.
Yeah, well, it's all there, yeah, but in what semblance of order because, well, ideally if we could actually locate the information that we do have, well, it might give us more time to look for the information we don't have.
Well, it's really that simple, I'd say.
Well, you carry on, Rachel.
I, for one, am glad you're here.
For one.
Oi!
She was wearing a good wig, Mrs Webb.
What relevance is that?
Probably none.
I never noticed she was wearing a wig.
Well, that's because you're a man, sir.
Is that a fact?
Well, Rachel, you coordinate with Sergeant Bacchus, I'd like you with us.
We're going to need help speaking to everybody in the camp and nobody is to check out until they've been interviewed.
Take that.
"Semblance of order", huh?
She's only been here two minutes, man, she's fiddling around with everything.
Calm down.
She's a good copper.
Aye, so everyone keeps telling us.
I don't see it, myself.
I mean, it's nice to have somebody here to make a cup of tea, she'd be good for that, granted.
I wanted her here.
We don't need her.
Well, I say we do, John.
Oh, well, you would.
She thinks you walk on water.
Are you jealous?
What?
You know, bright young spark, hard worker.
What are you saying?
You know what I'm saying.
You might want to step up, John.
Put a bit of seniority in your stride.
That wouldn't harm you, would it?
Cherry?
Yes?
I was at home last night, all right?
You want me to lie?
It's a tiny little white lie.
Todd...
If you wouldn't mind.
Is there something I don't know?
Just do it.
Daddy!
Hey, baby girl, let's have a look at you.
Beautiful.
I did this myself.
My very first plait.
Let me have a look at that.
Wowee, that's fantastic.
You're amazing, do you know that?
I didn't even know you were coming.
Well, I wanted to surprise you, didn't I?
Eh?
Are those your friends over there?
Why don't you go and play with them for ten minutes and I'll just have a quick word with your mum, all right?
See you in a bit.
What are you doing?
I'm talking to my daughter.
It's not your day.
It's not my day to talk to my daughter?
See, this is what it is with you...
John, this is just how it works.
It works for you, it doesn't really work for me!
Will you calm down?
We're just outside the school gates.
I know where we are, Lisa.
All right, thank you very much.
You see her every month.
It's what we agreed.
No, it's what you decided.
I had no choice, unless I take you to court, remember?
Oh, come on!
You see her about as much as I think you can manage.
You don't even pick her up on time.
That happened once.
Twice.
In two years that's not that bad.
I try, Lisa.
I might not be perfect, like you, but I try.
Yeah, you really try.
You know how to patronise me, don't you?
We all know you're in charge, Lisa, you keep ramming it down me bloody throat!
I don't want to talk to you any more, John.
Leigh-Anne!
You can't do this.
You can't just turn up.
You're being aggressive, you're frightening me.
I'm taking Leigh-Anne into school, you can see her in a few weeks.
I just want to see her!
Morning.
Do you ever sleep, you?
Do you ever smile?
I've done blocks A to F. Course you have.
You really don't like me, do you?
No.
No, it's not that.
I just don't need you here.
I can do it, all right, that's the point.
Right, so you'll know about the staff meeting, then, starting in five minutes?
Yeah, yeah.
You all right?
You're late.
Er, yeah.
Sorry.
Right, two tickets for Kiss Me Kate was purchased under Patrick Webb's name, but only one person went and that was Patrick.
Apparently he arrived alone.
And he sold the second ticket back to the box office just before the show.
CACKLING
Was she any good?
Get Mrs Webb in.
Right.
Whoo!
Is everyone here?
I have an announcement to make.
We have lost... .. one of our most beautiful Bluebirds.
Megan Webb... has been found dead off-camp.
SHOCKED MURMURING
I'm so sorry.
It is vital that you are able to seek solace in each other, but it is also vital that we maintain a standard for our campers.
And a smile.
And you will find yourself having to answer many difficult questions, but your bright and breezy answer to them is this - it is sunshine and business as usual at the Bluebird Holiday Camp.
Now, the police, of course, are investigating, and I trust that you will be as co-operative as they require.
But I've asked them to conduct their inquiries in a manner which will not upset our campers.
This, I must emphasise, is paramount.
That is all.
Lovely speech.
Lovely girl.
Hello.
I'm WPC Coles.
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
I've always had a thing about female police officers.
Oh, goodie for me.
I'm Detective Sergeant Bacchus.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
It's all right, Sergeant.
I've got this.
Hope so.
Name?
Manners.
Gary Manners.
Mr Manners, you worked with Megan Webb, is that correct?
You don't quite hold the same appeal as your colleague.
Answer the question, pal, all right?
I worked with her, yeah.
You worked with her...
I bet she was on your radar because you clearly have a thing with the lasses, don't you?
Aye, well, Megan clearly had a thing for the gents.
Hey, come back.
Did she have a thing for you?
That's interesting.
Maybe not.
Write this down.
Megan Webb had taste.
What did you just say?
Aye, go on.
Go on, Mr Manners, I dare you.
The thrill of chucking you in a police cell would absolutely make my day, so go on.
After you.
Right.
That's what I thought.
I'm a grown-up, you know.
I can cope.
The guy's an idiot.
Aye.
You're an idiot.
Knight in shining armour, eh?
What?
No, the guy's an idiot.
What?
Relations between staff members.
Yes.
Encouraged?
Banned?
Todd hates it.
But it goes on.
What about Megan and that Gary Manners fella?
Anything there?
I don't know.
Quick fling, maybe?
Well, when he heard about Megan, he looked as though he'd been punched in the stomach.
Well...
It's been a terrible shock for us all.
Do you know what happened between them?
Who broke it off?
No.
Sorry.
Could you confirm what your brother was doing on Saturday night?
He went home to his wife.
He left here around four and I didn't see him again until the morning.
And yourself?
I was supervising the dining hall.
We had a supervisor off sick, so I offered to step in.
I finished my shift around ten.
Rather a late night for me.
We'll need to speak to one of Megan's other cabin-mates.
Gail?
Gail, yes.
The kitchens are round the back.
I can walk you round.
Ah, we'll find our own way, thank you.
OK.
That Gary Manners fella, he's lying about something.
It's written all over his stupid, smug, shiny, stupid face.
Well, if you'd been dumped by a girl who ended up murdered, you might want to keep quiet about it.
He's as guilty as sin, man.
It's obvious.
He really kicked your perch, didn't he?
You want to tell me why you were late?
I went to see Lisa.
I went to see her at the school cos I wanted to talk to her about Leigh-Anne and my access and why I can't see her and it just all blew up.
What, you just turned up out the blue?
Yeah.
I did.
Yeah.
Clever
Yeah, all right.
All right.
Your powers of persuasion are getting better by the minute, John.
Miss Smith?
Gail, is it?
I'm DCI Gently.
This is Detective Sergeant Bacchus.
I've got to get these carrots done.
Well, we have permission to interview all staff, working, or otherwise.
I'm very sorry about what happened to your cabin-mate.
Shocking thing to happen.
Could say that.
We're searching your cabin right now.
Just so you know, OK?
Did you get on?
Three of you - you Justine and Megan - as cabin-mates?
Fine.
Three's a difficult number.
You're a bit younger than the other girls, aren't you?
What are you, 16?
In four months.
I'm 15.
Was that a problem?
In the cabin?
You know, any... ructions?
No.
Are you sure?
Anything at all?
Have you got a cigarette?
Gail...
Why did Megan dump Gary?
Don't know.
Gail, this is a murder investigation.
We ask questions and you answer, truthfully.
That's how it works.
We've got no time for messing about or telling fibs.
Well, I'm not lying, actually.
Well, you see, the word "actually" has kind of landed you in it there.
Actually.
I told you, I don't know.
What?
Three girls sharing a cabin together and you never had a good gossip about your love life?
Look, I've got to get back to work.
I've got to do this... .. and then I've got to change the chip fat.
Where were you on Saturday night, Gail?
Working.
Here.
All night.
You can ask any of the kitchen staff.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
I just found this in Justine's drawer and...
Are we done?
Yep.
What is it?
I don't know.
I think it's pine disinfectant.
Might be nothing.
Let's find out when the cabins are cleaned.
Who's got a car?
Say again?
Who's got a car?
If Megan was killed in there, somebody could have kept her there and waited till it was late enough to drive her to the pier.
Well, there's a staff car and the keys are kept behind the reception desk and all staff do have access, within reason.
That'll be it.
It's my turn!
Come here.
It's my turn.
But it's mine.
He's had it all day.
The pair of yous better pack it in, right.
But Dad!
Sir?
The lab report's back.
It's a match.
The blood in the car was the same type as Megan's.
124 witness statements and nobody saw a thing.
Well, not yet.
Where's John?
I'm not sure.
He, um...
Well, he disappeared when he heard that there was a solicitor in the building.
I'm not sure what it's about, but...
Sorry.
Oh, great.
You don't know what you're talking about.
You're an idiot!
I'm just telling you how it is.
He's an idiot, him.
Doesn't know what he's talking about.
I take it you cornered him about Leigh-Anne.
Yeah.
And he says the only option I have is to take Lisa to court and even then, right, statistically,
I have a minuscule chance of winning.
And either way, I've got to pay the court costs.
So, not only will I end up exactly where I started... .. I'll be bankrupt.
It's great, innit, that?
Terrific.
So, what does he recommend?
He doesn't.
He told me to forget it.
So I told him to shove his clipboard up his stupid...
John.
John.
John!
John!
Not here.
Sorry.
Why don't you go and talk to Lisa again?
I can't do that.
Why not?
Because, apparently, I scare her and she doesn't want me around.
It's ridiculous.
Oh, don't mind me.
I'm only Leigh-Anne's dad.
Just the hapless father, that's all.
Where was Gary Manners on Saturday night?
Oh, look at this, man.
She keeps shifting...
John!
Where was Gary Manners on Saturday night?
Er, oh, yeah...
Him and Justine were on stage at the camp from six till last orders.
Don't they ever give them a break?
I don't think so.
They treat them like pack-horses.
Don't even have time to eat.
How did you get on with Stretch's wife?
Sir, there was no answer on the phone, so I popped round and spoke to a neighbour, who said that Mrs Stretch and his daughters had left months ago.
Did they, indeed?
Oh, yeah, and I also called the village hairdressers about Mrs Webb and asked about her wig.
Well, hairdressers know everything, especially local hair-associated facts.
Well, childbirth.
All of her hair fell out when she gave birth to Megan.
She's been wearing a wig ever since.
It's always been a problem between mother and daughter, apparently.
That's great.
Innit?
That's amazing.
Really exemplary work there, WPC Coles.
Tell us something.
Were you one of those kids that wore their school uniform at the weekends?
Would you excuse us for a moment, please, Rachel.
Bright and female.
She really rattled your cage, didn't she?
No, no, it's not that.
She's just an arrogant know-all.
She's over you like a rash.
John...
She's all like, "Oh, Mr Gently, sir... "
John, John.
I feel for you, I really do.
Not seeing Leigh-Anne, it's grossly unfair...
What would you know about it?
You're not a father.
Thanks for that.
But that does not give you permission to come here and make everybody feel as diminished as you clearly do.
You get back to the holiday camp.
You're more use there than here.
Give it a day or two, most of these campers will be gone.
You don't know that.
I admire your optimism.
Tea?
No.
Not for me.
Where's Gary Manners right about now.
He's proving to be a bit elusive.
On his way to the dancehall, I should imagine.
Whipping up our campers into a heightened state of euphoria.
Really?
How long have you been married?
16 years.
To Kitty.
Two children, if indeed that was to be your next question.
Dorothy and Heather, 14 and 12.
Do you get home much?
Well, I work hard, Sergeant.
Is that why she left?
Ah, come on, man.
That piece of information's not going to pass us by, is it?
It's a murder investigation.
Look...
I don't want anyone to know.
Even my sister doesn't know.
I had to give Kitty some money to keep quiet.
I am a family man.
Was.
Does beg the question, though, doesn't it?
What you were really doing on Saturday night?
What is this?
I've always loved Kiss Me Kate.
Perhaps you could enlighten me about Saturday night's production.
I got drunk and slept here on the sofa.
It happens a little too often.
I was embarrassed.
You were at the camp all evening?
Yes.
Did you go anywhere?
Answer the question.
In the dancehall, there's a corner of the wings where I can stand without being seen.
I make notes.
The show has to be perfect.
Efficiency is everything if we are to maintain the numbers.
Standards need to be high.
Was Megan performing?
Yes.
You lied during the murder investigation of your own daughter.
If I'd told you where I was, you would have assumed the worst!
I always assume the worst of everybody.
I didn't kill her!
You know what?
I don't believe you.
Oh, there I go again...
I didn't kill her!
How could I?
Well, you had enough of a reason.
People don't need much, surprisingly.
It was a shock... when she left, yes?
Yes.
I felt like I wanted to die, actually.
It didn't make you happy, knowing that your only daughter was following her dream?
I told you before, Inspector, I thought it was an indulgence.
She wanted lessons after school.
Ballet, tap, singing, acting.
Instead, Patrick whisked her off to his sister for extra Latin classes.
She's an exemplary Latin teacher, his sister.
No social graces though, so I keep my distance when possible.
Well, Megan must have been naturally talented then, cos she didn't have any training or crafting of her talent.
Apparently so.
What did you want to do when you were a little girl?
Er...
I liked to tell stories.
Ah.
I was good at the voices.
My mum and dad used to wheel me out at parties.
I had some... .. ambition, you might say.
But it was not to be.
You lost your hair?
SHE SIGHS
After I gave birth to Megan... .. pretty as a picture, I was not.
Would you say your daughter was as pretty as a picture?
Of course I would!
And clearly she had the talent.
She was all set to have the career that you could never have.
Yes, yes.
All right!
You went to the camp, didn't you?
SHE SIGHS
Temptation got the better of me.
I just... .. wanted to see her sing.
Saturday night?
Right, campers, we know you're desperate to see the next act, so please put your hands together for the late-night version of the After Dark Bluebirds, led by our very own Megan Webb!
CHEERING
The Shoop Shoop Song
Any mistakes?
There's always room for polish.
Tighter footwork.
Wider smiles.
Why did your wife leave you?
It's ironic.
One fights to maintain the perfect family holiday and in doing so, destroys one's own precious little unit.
You wouldn't understand precious if it came up and hit you in the face.
I beg your pardon?
You sit there, talking about how important family is to you, when all the time, you were having it off with Megan Webb.
No, I wasn't.
Yes, you were.
I just wouldn't!
You're lying!
Again!
This may come as a surprise to you, Sergeant, but we are not all unfaithful.
Not all of us.
My weakness is this camp.
My father's camp.
I just want it to work.
And I can't fail.
I just can't.
Do you know what?
I came to this camp a few years back.
Really?
Yep.
Me, the wife, my daughter.
We had a great time.
I remember how busy it was.
It was absolutely packed with families.
Not so packed any more.
Your camp's dying, isn't it?
Hardly that.
Come on, man, this is 1969.
Family's not what it used to be.
I should know.
People don't want to come to holiday camps any more, they want to go further afield.
Your dancehall seems busy enough.
Your dining room, all that.
You've disguised those bits very well...
No, it is not a disguise!
It is clever programming.
We lead our campers like horses to water.
One big event on the hour, every hour.
If a room is full, they'll be happy, and they will keep coming back.
You'd do anything to save this camp, wouldn't you?
Did Patrick know you went?
Megan... .. obviously wanted me to come.
I was rather touched.
She wrote more than once?
Yes.
Every week.
But I couldn't write back.
Why not?
I didn't want to engage.
She'd... disobeyed me.
But then she told me an agent was coming.
An agent?
Yes.
Someone local had seen her, told someone else.
I thought, she must be... passable, if someone's coming to see her.
Did you speak to her?
After the show.
WHOOPING AND LAUGHING
What time was this?
I suppose... .. 9.20pm, 9.25pm, maybe?
Mum...
I won't come in.
What are you doing here?
I just came to see you sing a couple of songs and to say... yeah, well done.
Mum, please come in.
No, I couldn't possibly.
You came to see me.
Thought it was about time.
Got my letters, then?
Did the agent come?
You said in your letter...
Um...
I was cross with you.
Every week I write, and nothing.
I just found myself writing that, and...
I see.
No agent?
Oh, well.
That'll serve me right for not writing back.
I might not stay here, Mum.
Why?
I can't explain, really.
Mum, can I come home?
Home?
No.
No, darling, you can't.
I really should go.
Mum!
Mum...
Why'd you say no?
Because she was too good.
Oh.
She was so good, in fact, that I realised she was absolutely right, to have left home, gone to the camp.
It was a perfect platform for her.
She couldn't give it up and come home.
I wouldn't allow it.
If I didn't know you better,
I'd say you were starting to sound like a proud mum.
I don't know about that.
Oh, come on, Agnes.
"Come on" what, Mr Gently?
Do I regret not telling her that?
Absolutely that?
That I was proud of her?
Proud of her... beautiful performance?
I think so, yes.
Yes.
And regret can make a person... .. very, very angry and bitter.
Well... .. at least you went to see her.
That would have meant something to her.
You think?
Hmm.
Yeah, maybe.
But I didn't take her home with me, Inspector.
I didn't do as she asked.
We've lost our baby, Patrick.
Our baby.
SHE SOBS
She was such a good dancer.
I so wished you could have seen her.
I think it's what they call a cack-handed approach.
It was clumsy, certainly.
Just makes me laugh.
Does he think for one moment that him turning up like that is going to make me go, "Oh, yeah, all right, then.
"Just because you asked so nicely. "
John has got a particular way with words.
That's one way of putting it.
Oh, he's always been like this, hasn't he?
Gets in a rage, because he doesn't know what else to do.
But, you know, Lisa, underneath all of that... .. he might just have...
What?
.. a point.
A point?
Yeah.
Oh, no.
The amount of contact he has with Leigh-Anne is pitiful, Lisa.
It just is.
Is that what this is about?
This is why you asked us to meet?
I'll get us another drink.
I can't explain now...
I think it's best if we just get home as quick as we can...
Ah, we meet again.
I missed you.
I'll bet.
I mustn't dawdle.
Campers to entertain.
Everyone in this camp seems to think that you and Megan had a relationship except for you.
It's funny that, isn't it?
Yeah?
Well, I don't call a couple of nights in a cold, unoccupied cabin a relationship.
Maybe, you do.
How sweet
Someone even said that you were in love with her.
Who?
Oh, fascinating.
Meaning?
So many untruths whizzing about this camp, Sergeant.
Were you angry or upset when she ended it?
No.
Dear me, you're a terrible liar.
Why did she end it?
I don't know.
I don't care.
Well, you either genuinely don't know, in which case, you're thick, or you do know and you're just not telling me, in which case, you're a bit stupid.
Must be difficult in that dancehall without her.
Off you pop.
Will you think about it?
There's nothing to think about.
I disagree.
This has nothing to do with you, George.
Well, not directly, no.
But I think I know something of what John's going through.
I know what it's like to feel...
What?
Isabella died five years ago yesterday.
About this time, actually.
George, I'm sorry.
No, it's all right.
It's all right.
Well, it's not.
Lisa, I don't have a family... .. as John so kindly pointed out to me yesterday but what he doesn't know is that we did try.
For years.
We did all the tests, all of it, but...
And I think I would have made an all-right dad.
But...
Let him do it, Lisa.
George...
Something's got to give.
He could see Leigh-Anne more, couldn't he?
We've got a routine now.
This is not about routine.
This is about control.
I don't like the way you're saying that.
Why?
Why couldn't he see more of her?
Because seeing her so little, it's making his heart freeze, Lisa.
And he's her dad.
She's his little girl.
You can't change that.
You can't take that away from him.
Or her.
You look like the boss to me.
Not the other one.
Hello, there.
Just something about the way you hold yourself.
It's fun here when the sun starts to fade, isn't it?
Depends what you mean by fun.
Oh, holiday camps are all about sunshine, blue skies.
Smiling faces, colour, laughing...
It's a well-trodden path but when the night falls, we don't think about the shadows.
Let me ask you something.
Why did you lie to us when we first questioned you about Gary?
You said that Megan wasn't seeing anyone.
She wasn't, they'd split up.
Clever clogs.
What are you doing, Justine?
Well, it's my evening off.
I came out for a fag but I can't be seen loitering.
So, I'd appreciate it if miraculously you'd forgotten you'd seen us.
You and Megan were good friends, were you?
Do we have to talk about this now?
Go down the station, talk about it there if you fancy.
Well, I liked her a lot.
She knew who she was, what she was doing here.
It's an over-used term, Sergeant, but Megan was a good person.
A friend.
What about Gail?
Was she jealous at all about your friendship?
Gail's young.
I think she's used to being the underdog, but I'm... .. I'm working on her.
I used to be a bit like that... .. like Gail...
.. and then I came here and everything changed.
I can't imagine you ever being like Gail.
Oh, I'd surprise you, Sergeant.
Gary and Megan were in a relationship, were they?
Yeah, everyone knows that.
Why did she dump him?
Nobody answers that question.
Why will nobody answer that question?
I don't know why she dumped him.
She was so into him.
So excited when he first showed an interest in her.
He singled her out... .. invited her to this party where it all began.
We got her ready.
I lent her a dress.
That's better.
It's all about accentuation.
Isn't it a bit much?
No.
It's actually perfect.
Now, can you see what can be done?
Anything's possible...
Yeah, but I haven't even got the basics.
Oh, we can create the basics.
Trust me.
"Ha!
Ha!
Said The Clown" by Manfred Mann
Go and get a drink.
See what happens.
"Build Me Up Buttercup" by The Foundations
MUSIC DROWNS HIS WHISPER
Look and learn, Gail.
Look and learn.
Well, they'd been seeing each other a couple of weeks and she suddenly went cold on him.
Did she find out he was seeing anybody else?
Anything like that?
I don't know.
I think you do.
Well, you would.
It's your job to be suspicious.
Come on, pet.
Sorry to disappoint.
Were you on stage all night on Saturday?
Yeah, between six and midnight.
Didn't leave the dancehall ever?
No.
Sure?
Absolutely.
I hate to admit it but I'm rather frightened, Sergeant.
It could happen again, couldn't it?
I'd get inside if I were you, pet.
Till we've made an arrest, this camp might not be the safest place to be.
Ta-ra.
Why did Megan want to leave that camp?
Something changed.
And something's bothering me.
The staff didn't know about Megan's murder until about ten the next morning.
Right?
Yeah, about that...
And the newspapers arrive at 11 o'clock, yeah?
Yeah, they get delivered to the cabins.
So by mid-morning, everybody knows.
Yes?
Yeah.
Right, well... there's a list of families who tried to check out of the camp before they were interviewed.
Nothing too troubling about that.
They wanted to get the hell out of there, I don't blame them.
But one family were recorded by the...
John, listen.
One family were recorded by the receptionist as desperately trying to leave at quarter past ten, Monday morning,
45 minutes before the newspapers arrived.
Yeah, and there's no radios in any of the cabins.
Sylvia and Timothy Ryan.
Cabin Red 4?
No, no, I remember now.
There was no answer when I was doing my checks.
Bring them both in - separate interviews.
Don't worry, Mr Ryan, you'll be next.
Got any children?
Yeah.
Like that, is it?
Well, life changes after kids.
Some people say for the better.
Well, it depends on your point of view.
People shouldn't have kids if they don't want them.
No-one tells you they destroy your lives.
You know what?
I hope your kids never ever hear you say that.
Oh, it's always the dads who judge the most.
And the ones who see the kids the least.
Do you know what...
Right, let's just stick to the point, shall we?
Is he staying?
Yes.
Now, where were you on Saturday night, Mrs Ryan?
I was at the camp.
Where do you think I was?
Don't get smart.
What were you doing around 9.30?
I can't remember.
Think!
Yeah, I...
I called my mum.
Tim was on his way to the dancehall,
I remember I needed to call my mum.
What about?
This and that.
Give me the number.
What?
Your mother's number.
Well, presumably she would have remembered the phone call.
So, I'll ask you again.
I went to a cabin, to meet a fella... .. a Bluebird.
Who?
His name was...
Gary.
Gary Manners?
I don't know his second name.
Gary Manners!
I'd been at the camp a week and on the second night we got chatting and we hit it off.
This was our third date, of sorts.
What time was this?
I met him around... ten.
There was a competition.
The campers got 20 minutes to dance for the judges.
Gary could come off stage - he slipped away and no-one noticed.
Go on.
Well, I met him in his cabin.
We were...
Making daisy chains.
Yeah, I know.
I get it.
When this music suddenly started, really loud - coming from a cabin nearby.
"BUILD ME UP BUTTERCUP" BLARES
What's the matter?
It's coming from Meg's cabin.
Oh, we've only got 15 minutes!
She needs to turn it down.
No, it'll be fine.
She needs to turn it down!
Meg, what are you doing?
Turn it down.
Meg, what are you playing at?
Turn it down!
VOLUME LOWERS
Thank you.
Meg?
Hello?
'How long was the music playing for?
'
Minute and a half - maybe less.
And how long were you and Gary...?
15 minutes.
Then what?
I ran back to the dance hall.
What about Gary?
Yeah, he went there too.
Just... different route.
Did you see him go?
No, but five minutes later he were on the stage.
Five minutes?
Why did you try and check out early?
Gary came to find me, when the staff had heard about the girl... the dead girl.
Well, the music we heard, Gary thought it were a bit odd.
It was too loud, out of character.
We wondered if... .. we'd witnessed something.
And you couldn't tell us because your husband would find out.
But what about Gary?
I don't know.
Because she's not Gary's usual fare, is she?
I beg your pardon.
I mean, look at her.
He could have anyone.
That's just insulting!
At least I've not got a face that looks like a horse's head caught in a clamp.
Clever.
And you'd be surprised - a lot of men like a bit of flesh.
But not Gary, eh?
I don't know what you mean.
Yes, you do.
You paid him for the sex, didn't you?
The lying git.
Megan must have found out about him.
It's not the kind of thing you want to hear about your nice new boyfriend, is it?
You're looking forward to this, aren't you?
Yeah.
Right, last six!
Three... five...
Well done.
Good, well done.
Good workout!
Star pupil!
Whoo!
Oh, God, I think I'm going to throw up.
Gary, put it away, man, will you?
I want a word with you.
I'm busy!
Now, please.
Where's the fire, gentlemen?
It's not a good look in front of the campers.
Did you sleep with Sylvia Ryan?
I need to get on, got back-to-back classes.
Well, I'll take that as a yes then.
Look, we could do this down at the station, if you like.
And there, I guarantee, you will start sweating.
It's just a bit of fun.
Do it often?
I'm a consenting adult.
Indeed you are.
But unfortunately you consented to take money for it, didn't you?
Did Megan find out and threaten to tell somebody about it?
Hey, is that why you killed her, Gary?
I wouldn't hurt Megan!
Not in a million years.
See, at the moment,
I don't believe a single word that comes out of your mouth.
First you're not seeing Megan, then you are.
You didn't leave the dancehall, then you did.
Add that to your vice activity, you're already looking at a jail term.
I didn't kill her.
Yeah, right.
I didn't kill her!
You're a smarmy git, you are, Gary.
You want to watch yourself, all roads seem to be leading to you.
Because I had some assignations, I'm capable of murder?
How many times do I need to say it?
You want to back off, man, all right?
You've got this very wrong.
You were very fond of Megan, weren't you?
Yeah, I know.
OK.
Did she find out that you were accepting money for sex?
Yes.
Who else knew?
Who else knew?
No-one.
You're lying.
I'm not.
See, I'm better at this than you are, Gary.
Now, there is something.
Isn't there?
There's something around the notion of who else knew.
Because why would you lie?
Who are you protecting?
You weren't the only one.
Were you, Gary?
Thanks, Gary.
I'm lost.
Stretch is running a knocking shop, John, right here in the camp.
Are you quite serious?
This is a family holiday camp, Inspector, it slightly misses the point.
I suggest you wipe that grin off your face and take a seat, Mr Stretch.
Gary Manners regularly slept with female campers for money.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Well, I think you do, Mr Stretch.
Was Megan a part of this?
What?
Was she one of your girls?
Cherry, Inspector Gently is under the misguided and quite frankly ludicrous impression that this camp is gaining from immoral earnings.
Would you kindly tell him that we know nothing of any prostitution.
Who told you that?
Gary Manners gave himself away.
Gary likes the sound of his own voice.
Bit of a boaster.
So you knew nothing about this?
Nothing at all?
Because Gary says he wasn't the only one.
I had to do something.
There were these loan sharks and they needed cash fast.
What are you saying?
Todd knew nothing about this.
What have you done?
The camp was failing, Todd.
We would have failed.
What have you done?
!
The camp was going under, Todd - the whole thing!
Families weren't coming any more.
We were that close.
I had to keep it afloat!
No, Cherry... not like this.
This is all we have.
This is all we are!
You're so naive, Todd.
It's business, just business.
I know it's hard, but we needed the cash.
We'd be dead otherwise.
Sit down, Mr Stretch.
How did you... market this business?
We watched, at meal-times, the couples who were struggling.
The men who looked straight past their own wives, so they could get a good look at someone else's.
Oh, it's everywhere, Inspector - unhappy couples.
Especially on holiday... all that flesh, every flaw exposed.
And what about Megan?
What about her?
Come on, Cherry, there's more.
What about Megan?
I invited her to join us.
Well, I didn't, Gary did.
We'd set the whole thing up.
I thought if she fell in love with Gary, she'd be more pliable.
Did Megan refuse to get involved?
We'd never been turned down before, we selected carefully.
She put a value on herself and it was beyond money.
And did she threaten to blow the whistle?
Yes.
Did you kill her?
No.
I was at my wit's end, yes, needed her to shut up.
We all needed her to shut up and then... .. you came and she was dead.
You say you selected carefully.
How?
They had to be... .. um... pretty... ambitious... girls and boys.
They had to be 16 and over, I was very strict about that.
16 or over?
Gail?
Justine, would you mind for a minute?
Whose is this?
It's mine.
Why was it in Justine's drawer?
Don't look at her.
She said I didn't need it any more.
Why?
Gail...
Justine, shut it.
Because I'm a grown-up now.
In what way?
Gail, a girl has died...
Megan has died.
Now, we know that some of the Bluebirds were involved with men and women who paid them for sex.
She wasn't part of it.
Yeah, I was.
Cherry didn't know, Cherry thought I were too young.
But Justine thought I were ready.
Justine, did you set Gail up with clients?
Did Megan find out?
She's 15!
She's a child!
Megan cared about that, didn't she?
There's one thing finding out her mates were sleeping with campers.
But this was too much, wasn't it?
Gail dropped the money.
She shouldn't have dropped the money!
"Sugar, Sugar" by The Archies
Meg, I thought you were in the staff room.
I'm not going.
Why?
What are you two doing back?
Sneaked out.
Gail fancies the new kitchen porter.
Don't you, Gail?
I said I'd redo her hair for the late shift.
Right, you, hairbrush.
Sit.
They're only on that dance floor for 16 minutes.
Then I'll be right back on that stage.
I'm sure she can do her own hair.
Only Justine can do it for me.
Is it yours?
No.
I'm asking Gail.
Gail?
No.
She's started?
Is that what you're doing, now?
You're getting her ready for a punter?
You should go back to work.
What about you?
Just go, now.
"BUILD ME UP BUTTERCUP" COMES ON
She wanted to get started.
She's just a kid.
I'm helping her out!
Really?
You really think that?
Meg, don't be angry.
I'm helping her feel beautiful.
You actually enjoy it, don't you?
What?
You actually enjoy dressing up a 15-year-old girl as your doll and sending her off to have sex with oily, bloated campers.
I turned her into something, I did that.
She was nothing.
Wow.
You're a star-maker...
You really need to be quiet.
.. making dreams come true
Except this isn't Hollywood Boulevard, it's a holiday camp.
SHE TURNS THE MUSIC UP You need to shut your mouth.
Gail is too young!
I'm calling the police, you whore!
No, you're...
KNOCK AT THE DOOR Meg, what are you doing?
Turn it down.
Meg, what are you playing at?
Turn it down!
Thank you.
'Why didn't you just report Megan's death as an accident?
'
Meg?
'And take the chance 'the police would come and find out about the other stuff?
'
'And then?
'
I stood there in the dark.
The door went again and I thought it was Gary.
But it was me.
I was worried about Justine.
You came out twice?
We've got statements.
People said you were in the kitchen all night.
I'm the girl nobody notices.
I slipped away just fine.
Hello?
DISTANT KNOCKING
Justine... .. where's Meg?
Don't switch the light on.
What's going on?
Something happened and there was an accident.
Megan was going to call the police.
So I just...
She fell.
What do you mean?
She's dead.
What?
SHE WHIMPERS
No, you need to be quiet.
You need to be very, very quiet.
Everything that happens in the next five minutes is really, really important.
And you need to do everything I say, right?
Everything.
We need to get back to work.
So... help me push her under the bed and we can... we can deal with her later.
What?
Right?
Come on, under the bed.
No, don't get any blood on you!
Don't.
Gail, get back to work.
Hurry.
Well, Justine killed Megan.
That wasn't your problem.
I had to help.
What, you have to do everything she says?
Sleep with men when she says?
Move bodies when she says?
I don't know...
You're upsetting her.
You made her an accessory to murder!
And after Gail helped, you went back to the dancehall.
Yeah?
Yes.
Well, somebody must have noticed you were late.
We looked after each other.
Where have you been?
Last-minute appointment.
You're all right.
Didn't know you had one.
Spontaneity's my middle name.
The old boys love it.
That's why I'm earning more money than you.
Well, what about the delicious Sylvia Ryan?
Aye.
Except Megan was playing her music full blast.
It was distracting.
Right.
I need to talk to her.
Yeah, you should.
But I... .. I think she's getting an early night.
Maybe you should try her tomorrow.
Right, ladies and gentlemen, that is your 20 minutes' dance time up.
So I hope you had a good time down there because I certainly enjoyed watching you all.
'What about the body?
'
'We waited till three o'clock in the morning. '
For Cherry, it was all about business.
This one...
this one was something different.
I think she saw herself as some kind of Svengali.
I wonder what Stretch'll do now.
Camp's a goner, isn't it?
30 years of family holidays, how ironic.
Oh, speaking of joyous family life,
Lisa called, left a message.
What?
Yeah.
What did she want?
She's dropping off Leigh-Anne in about half an hour.
No, I'm not seeing her for three week.
I don't know, something about a new deal.
Every other weekend, I think she said.
You're joking?
I'm not.
You're joking!
No, I'm not.
Why... why's she changed her mind?
I don't know, John.
I've got to go.
Night, John.
Here's my girl!
Give us a hug!
Oh!
Thanks for that, it means everything.
Have a nice evening.
Excuse me.
Yes.
I want you off this beach now, please.
Have a bit of respect, all right?
It's not a sight for children is it?
Some people!
Bob, Bob, I want these people off that pier, all right?
I want the whole pier cleared.
Can you move off the pier, please?
Quickly now!
Sorry, we're moving.
We're moving on.
Thank you.
Hello there.
Hiya.
Is she on her own?
Yeah.
My name's John.
Are you all right?
Where's your mummy and daddy?
They're asleep.
Asleep?
So did you bring out the dog for a walk on your own?
Do you know what, if you were my little lass,
I wouldn't let you out of my sight.
I'd also buy you a big fat massive ice cream...
I think it might be a little bit too early.
What do you think?
No, it's not!
No, not too early?
Come on then, let's go and get one.
There we go.
Morning, Sir.
Nice day for it.
About 16 to 17 by the looks of it.
She's no ID, but there's a massive blow to the side of the head.
Think she was dead before she hit the water.
She's wearing a Bluebird Holiday Camp uniform.
Can't have been in the water very long.
Time of death is...
Oh, I dunno, some time today, early hours of the morning, something like that.
What do you think?
You all right?
Get her in.
Right, I'll get the lads.
All right, let's get her in.
Any witnesses?
Not yet, no.
Old fella said he saw a young couple down here last night.
Could've been her...
With a bloke - things get out of hand, you know.
Description fit?
Not really, no.
Was dark though.
Is that all you've got?
Give us a chance, sir, will you?
You searched the pier?
What?
The pier.
Have you searched the pier?
No, not yet.
Something tells me that the beach is the priority, Guv.
And something tells me you've not heard of longshore drift.
That body travelled inland.
You'd dump her at the furthest point, of course, closest to the open sea - gives her a better chance of drifting away.
But you'd be very wrong cos the current would just take her straight round, right where she was found.
A pier at night can house all sorts.
Meaning?
It's more private than the beach.
Perfect for an illicit night-time stroll, over the waves.
Very romantic.
Sounds like you've been there and done that.
I might have known a late-night stroll along the pier in my time, John.
Really?
I don't have you down as a man who likes it al fresco.
Now, there's a line.
And I just crossed it.
You've just...
Yeah, absolutely.
Sorry.
I want every inch of this pier searched.
All right.
Sorry.
Bluebird's eh?
Yeah.
Bluebird's three or four miles that way.
We went there, you know, me and Lisa.
Did you?
Mmm, a few years back.
It was good.
Just after Leigh-Anne was born.
We went to a holiday camp right after the war.
Never seen so many families in one place, you know, enjoying themselves for the first time.
A whole new world.
Are you missing Leigh-Anne?
Yeah.
I've not seen her for three week.
Can you believe that?
That's not enough, is it?
No, it's not enough.
I'm fine when I'm not thinking about her.
You know, I'm fine then.
But you think about her all the time.
Yeah.
Isabel!
Sorry.
Welcome to Bluebird!
Can I help you, gentlemen?
Wives powdering their noses in the car, and children causing mischief after a long drive, I'll bet?
Let me get someone to help you with your bags.
No, thank you.
I'm DCI Gently.
Could we speak to the manager, please?
Of course.
Well, would you like a lift?
No, thank you.
We'll walk.
I'll show you the way.
Go!
One, two, three, four, five, six...
Sorry to disturb, Miss Stretch, these gentlemen wish to see Mr Stretch.
They're policeman.
Thank you, Justine.
Detective Chief Inspector Gently.
Cherry.
This is Detective Sergeant Bacchus.
My brother Todd shouldn't be long.
It's all a bit manic here today.
The body of a young woman was found this morning.
We believe that she worked here.
Obviously we're very anxious to identify her.
Anyone missing?
I'm...
I'm sorry?
Body was found on the beach near the pier.
Why do you think she worked here?
She wore a Bluebird uniform.
Right.
Anyone missing, to your knowledge?
Well...
I don't know.
Staff rotas aren't really my thing.
Might need to try harder than that.
All my workers live on site.
There's a late-comers board.
If someone hasn't clocked in, then their name get's chalked up.
Good.
Shall we?
Hello, Mr Stretch.
Sophie.
Sally.
Do you live on site, Mr Stretch?
No.
I live at home with my wife and two daughters.
I'm very lucky.
Business good?
Chin up, Lottie.
Oh, yes.
We are a powerhouse, gentlemen - built from dust.
But a few loans started my father off, and he opened the doors in '36.
No-one had ever seen anything quite like it.
Family holidays for the masses.
We've been full to bursting ever since.
You know there is a great pleasure in having to turn punters away.
Here we are.
Ah, Megan.
Blue for Bluebird?
Yes.
Does she live with anybody, share a room?
Justine Leyland, I believe.
Senior Bluebird.
We've met her already.
Ah, yes.
She's been scooping up the new arrivals, and hurling them into a dance competition to whet their appetite.
I think the Bluebirds will be arriving in the dance hall now.
Thank you.
Inspector?
Yes.
Now, we can keep all this a little...
low, can't we?
I'm sorry?
People are on their holidays.
Yes?
Well, this is a camp of smiles.
It's a holiday from their grey little lives.
We don't want a gloomy little storm cloud gathering.
Are you asking us to protect your business, Mr Stretch?
Simply asking for a little discretion.
I don't think you've quite got it yet, have you?
A member of your staff has been found dead.
We need staff rotas, the names of everybody who was working last night.
Oh, and the guests.
Of course.
We need the names of all the guests.
Dance hall, you said?
MUSIC: "Helpless" by Kim Weston
I'm happy to be the girl if you fancy a dance.
No, you're all right, thank you very much.
Lisa and I won this, you know.
Did you?
Won the cup in this very room.
She's a good mover is Lisa.
Really cracking little dancer.
I mean, she wouldn't have won the cup without me.
Is that right?
Yeah.
Fred Astaire of the North-East, me.
Look at the moves.
Quality.
Well, much as I'd like to stand here and admire your...fluidity.
Well done, campers!
Wow, are you all trained or something?
They said that when we were here.
So, the dance competition is now closed, so now we have the Bluebird Boppers while our judges make their decision and it won't be long till this little cup get's given to one lucky family.
Could we have a word, please?
Inspector?
Somewhere quieter.
So, ladies and gentlemen, a big hand for the Bluebird Boppers!
So, your cabin mate Megan Webb...
What about her?
She didn't come to work this morning.
Yeah, well, she's always late.
She'll stroll in any minute looking immaculate.
Do you share a cabin?
There's three of us.
Who's the third?
Gail.
Little kitchen maid.
Buried in chip fat, as we speak, lucky old thing.
When's the last time that you saw Megan?
Be last night, on stage.
She'd finished after the first show.
Did she come back here at all last night?
No.
Was she meeting anybody?
Well, she didn't say she was.
What's going on?
We're just making some enquiries.
Really?
Two plain-clothes detectives?
We've found a body - a girl.
She was wearing a Bluebird uniform.
Long blonde hair, very pretty.
No!
What was Megan wearing when you saw her last?
Er...
Her uniform.
She'd just finished her shift.
Was that the last time you saw her?
I told you, she didn't come back last night.
You didn't report her?
I'm her friend, so, no.
That's what we do.
She's got enough black marks next to her name as it is.
Did she have a boyfriend?
Not that I know of.
Are you sure?
I told you, I don't know.
Well, thank you, you'll want to be getting back to announce those winners.
Until we've spoken to the family, got a positive ID...
You want me to keep me mouth shut.
Well, it might not be her.
Yeah, but it might.
Yeah.
MUSIC: "Heaven Must Have Sent You" by Bonnie Pointer
Lisa, it's me.
Yeah.
Listen,
I was wondering if I could see Leigh-Anne this weekend?
I know it's not my weekend.
Right.
No, no, I can't wait three weeks.
It's not fair.
Why?
I know what the agreement is, Lisa.
Once a month's not enough, it's nowhere near, it's not even close.
No, no, I'm her dad, Lisa.
I'm her dad!
And I only get to see her 12 times a year.
12 - it's ridiculous!
No, listen...
I don't think you realise how ridi...
Oh, you stupid...!
She hung up on us.
Can you believe that?
Must be your softly-softly approach, John.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means easy does it.
Come on.
Pathology report's back.
John?
Huh?
Sorry, go on.
No sign of rape, or sexual assault.
She wasn't a virgin.
And no water in the lungs.
Well, that means she'd have been dead when she hit the water, doesn't it?
Very.
It'd only been there a few hours.
Time of death was between eight and ten on Saturday evening.
It'd have been busy in the pier, Saturday night.
I don't think she died on the pier, John.
I think she was killed somewhere else, kept there for eight or so hours, and then taken to the pier, dumped over the side.
Somebody hoped that she would just drift away without a trace.
That's a bit stupid, that, isn't it?
Yeah, very.
What happens now?
Well, can we drive you home?
I've got the car.
Don't you want to talk to us?
We can do that later.
I want to do it now.
Agnes...
Well, what are we going to do?
Go home, chop some vegetables, put the radio on?
Darling...
Inspector?
She told us at dinner... ..about the job at the camp.
It was my birthday.
I'd made a quiche Lorraine.
One always hopes that someone else will cook on your birthday, but not this time.
Megan!
On the table!
Megan!
Megan.
Patrick, did you polish both serving spoons?
Yes, I think so...
You think?
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
When you ask if you can help, dear, and then don't do the very thing that I ask, there really is very little point, is there?
Have we got any butter?
There's already butter on the potatoes.
I'd like to put a bit more on.
You heard your mother, you don't need any more.
I'd like some more, please.
Run along and get it then.
We'll wait till you return.
I've got a job at the Bluebird Holiday Camp.
And so it began.
She left when?
The following morning.
She was resolute.
She took the bus.
The blue one, with the flaky upholstery.
When was this?
About two months ago.
And you haven't seen her since?
No.
Did you visit her at the camp?
No.
Thank you, Rachel.
Was this new, this desire to break free?
The last two years have been rather disruptive, Inspector.
Cos we...we moved, from London to Newcastle - from a dear little house in Richmond.
Nice neighbours, everything just as we wanted it.
And Patrick got a promotion up here.
He's from Newcastle, you see.
And then after the move,
Megan did become perhaps a little surly, but then she did have dreams of achieving something which was just beyond the realms of possibility.
What was that?
She wanted to become an actress, a performer.
You didn't approve?
It's a wildly frivolous occupation, Inspector, bound in... ..uncertainty and self-indulgence and those who really need it are fragile creatures, in my opinion.
"Look at me!" Isn't that what it's saying?
Perhaps.
Was she good at it?
What?
Megan, was she any good?
Was she a good performer?
I've no idea.
But the notion of her wanting to get a job at the camp to achieve her dreams was quite frankly laughable.
Why was that?
The Bluebird Holiday Camp is hardly the Royal Shakespeare Company, is it?
It's a playground for those with less than Patrick and I.
We prefer to holiday at Whitby.
Wonderful steam train.
I love steam trains.
Did she contact you after she got to the camp or while she was there?
She wrote.
Once.
Can we see it, that letter?
I don't have it.
I saw no reason to keep it.
Was she precious to you, your daughter?
What sort of a question is that?
Well, parents don't usually throw away their children's letters, do they?
Especially if they haven't seen them for a few weeks, their only daughter.
She was enjoying being amongst all those campers, enjoying the hysteria.
I saw no reason to read that letter more than once.
Right, one more question.
What were you both doing last night?
What, pray, are you suggesting?
Just answer the question, please.
We went to the theatre.
At the village hall.
Amateur dramatic production of Kiss Me Kate - it was rather good.
Thank you.
I'd run away to a holiday camp if that was the alternative.
Indeed.
She didn't seem very upset, did she?
Visibly unmoved, I'd say.
Methodical.
Taut.
We'd better check their alibi.
I could do that.
All right.
I've got it.
You still here?
I'm compartmentalising.
What?
Well, er, your filing system is, um, questionable...
Sir.
Is it now?
No, it's not.
It's not?
No.
Well, you see, Detective Sergeant, I would be interested in your definition of an operational filing system when there appears to be a lack of any files.
It's all right.
It's all there.
Yeah, well, it's all there, yeah, but in what semblance of order because, well, ideally if we could actually locate the information that we do have, well, it might give us more time to look for the information we don't have.
Well, it's really that simple, I'd say.
Well, you carry on, Rachel.
I, for one, am glad you're here.
For one.
Oi!
She was wearing a good wig, Mrs Webb.
What relevance is that?
Probably none.
I never noticed she was wearing a wig.
Well, that's because you're a man, sir.
Is that a fact?
Well, Rachel, you coordinate with Sergeant Bacchus, I'd like you with us.
We're going to need help speaking to everybody in the camp and nobody is to check out until they've been interviewed.
Take that.
"Semblance of order", huh?
She's only been here two minutes, man, she's fiddling around with everything.
Calm down.
She's a good copper.
Aye, so everyone keeps telling us.
I don't see it, myself.
I mean, it's nice to have somebody here to make a cup of tea, she'd be good for that, granted.
I wanted her here.
We don't need her.
Well, I say we do, John.
Oh, well, you would.
She thinks you walk on water.
Are you jealous?
What?
You know, bright young spark, hard worker.
What are you saying?
You know what I'm saying.
You might want to step up, John.
Put a bit of seniority in your stride.
That wouldn't harm you, would it?
Cherry?
Yes?
I was at home last night, all right?
You want me to lie?
It's a tiny little white lie.
Todd...
If you wouldn't mind.
Is there something I don't know?
Just do it.
Daddy!
Hey, baby girl, let's have a look at you.
Beautiful.
I did this myself.
My very first plait.
Let me have a look at that.
Wowee, that's fantastic.
You're amazing, do you know that?
I didn't even know you were coming.
Well, I wanted to surprise you, didn't I?
Eh?
Are those your friends over there?
Why don't you go and play with them for ten minutes and I'll just have a quick word with your mum, all right?
See you in a bit.
What are you doing?
I'm talking to my daughter.
It's not your day.
It's not my day to talk to my daughter?
See, this is what it is with you...
John, this is just how it works.
It works for you, it doesn't really work for me!
Will you calm down?
We're just outside the school gates.
I know where we are, Lisa.
All right, thank you very much.
You see her every month.
It's what we agreed.
No, it's what you decided.
I had no choice, unless I take you to court, remember?
Oh, come on!
You see her about as much as I think you can manage.
You don't even pick her up on time.
That happened once.
Twice.
In two years that's not that bad.
I try, Lisa.
I might not be perfect, like you, but I try.
Yeah, you really try.
You know how to patronise me, don't you?
We all know you're in charge, Lisa, you keep ramming it down me bloody throat!
I don't want to talk to you any more, John.
Leigh-Anne!
You can't do this.
You can't just turn up.
You're being aggressive, you're frightening me.
I'm taking Leigh-Anne into school, you can see her in a few weeks.
I just want to see her!
Morning.
Do you ever sleep, you?
Do you ever smile?
I've done blocks A to F. Course you have.
You really don't like me, do you?
No.
No, it's not that.
I just don't need you here.
I can do it, all right, that's the point.
Right, so you'll know about the staff meeting, then, starting in five minutes?
Yeah, yeah.
You all right?
You're late.
Er, yeah.
Sorry.
Right, two tickets for Kiss Me Kate was purchased under Patrick Webb's name, but only one person went and that was Patrick.
Apparently he arrived alone.
And he sold the second ticket back to the box office just before the show.
Was she any good?
Get Mrs Webb in.
Right.
Whoo!
Is everyone here?
I have an announcement to make.
We have lost... ..one of our most beautiful Bluebirds.
Megan Webb... has been found dead off-camp.
I'm so sorry.
It is vital that you are able to seek solace in each other, but it is also vital that we maintain a standard for our campers.
And a smile.
And you will find yourself having to answer many difficult questions, but your bright and breezy answer to them is this - it is sunshine and business as usual at the Bluebird Holiday Camp.
Now, the police, of course, are investigating, and I trust that you will be as co-operative as they require.
But I've asked them to conduct their inquiries in a manner which will not upset our campers.
This, I must emphasise, is paramount.
That is all.
Lovely speech.
Lovely girl.
Hello.
I'm WPC Coles.
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
I've always had a thing about female police officers.
Oh, goodie for me.
I'm Detective Sergeant Bacchus.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
It's all right, Sergeant.
I've got this.
Hope so.
Name?
Manners.
Gary Manners.
Mr Manners, you worked with Megan Webb, is that correct?
You don't quite hold the same appeal as your colleague.
Answer the question, pal, all right?
I worked with her, yeah.
You worked with her...
I bet she was on your radar because you clearly have a thing with the lasses, don't you?
Aye, well, Megan clearly had a thing for the gents.
Hey, come back.
Did she have a thing for you?
That's interesting.
Maybe not.
Write this down.
Megan Webb had taste.
What did you just say?
Aye, go on.
Go on, Mr Manners, I dare you.
The thrill of chucking you in a police cell would absolutely make my day, so go on.
After you.
Right.
That's what I thought.
I'm a grown-up, you know.
I can cope.
The guy's an idiot.
Aye.
You're an idiot.
Knight in shining armour, eh?
What?
No, the guy's an idiot.
What?
Relations between staff members.
Yes.
Encouraged?
Banned?
Todd hates it.
But it goes on.
What about Megan and that Gary Manners fella?
Anything there?
I don't know.
Quick fling, maybe?
Well, when he heard about Megan, he looked as though he'd been punched in the stomach.
Well...
It's been a terrible shock for us all.
Do you know what happened between them?
Who broke it off?
No.
Sorry.
Could you confirm what your brother was doing on Saturday night?
He went home to his wife.
He left here around four and I didn't see him again until the morning.
And yourself?
I was supervising the dining hall.
We had a supervisor off sick, so I offered to step in.
I finished my shift around ten.
Rather a late night for me.
We'll need to speak to one of Megan's other cabin-mates.
Gail?
Gail, yes.
The kitchens are round the back.
I can walk you round.
Ah, we'll find our own way, thank you.
OK.
That Gary Manners fella, he's lying about something.
It's written all over his stupid, smug, shiny, stupid face.
Well, if you'd been dumped by a girl who ended up murdered, you might want to keep quiet about it.
He's as guilty as sin, man.
It's obvious.
He really kicked your perch, didn't he?
You want to tell me why you were late?
I went to see Lisa.
I went to see her at the school cos I wanted to talk to her about Leigh-Anne and my access and why I can't see her and it just all blew up.
What, you just turned up out the blue?
Yeah.
I did.
Yeah.
Clever(!
)
Yeah, all right.
All right.
Your powers of persuasion are getting better by the minute, John.
Miss Smith?
Gail, is it?
I'm DCI Gently.
This is Detective Sergeant Bacchus.
I've got to get these carrots done.
Well, we have permission to interview all staff, working, or otherwise.
I'm very sorry about what happened to your cabin-mate.
Shocking thing to happen.
Could say that.
We're searching your cabin right now.
Just so you know, OK?
Did you get on?
Three of you - you Justine and Megan - as cabin-mates?
Fine.
Three's a difficult number.
You're a bit younger than the other girls, aren't you?
What are you, 16?
In four months.
I'm 15.
Was that a problem?
In the cabin?
You know, any...ructions?
No.
Are you sure?
Anything at all?
Have you got a cigarette?
Gail...
Why did Megan dump Gary?
Don't know.
Gail, this is a murder investigation.
We ask questions and you answer, truthfully.
That's how it works.
We've got no time for messing about or telling fibs.
Well, I'm not lying, actually.
Well, you see, the word "actually" has kind of landed you in it there.
Actually.
I told you, I don't know.
What?
Three girls sharing a cabin together and you never had a good gossip about your love life?
Look, I've got to get back to work.
I've got to do this... ..and then I've got to change the chip fat.
Where were you on Saturday night, Gail?
Working.
Here.
All night.
You can ask any of the kitchen staff.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
I just found this in Justine's drawer and...
Are we done?
Yep.
What is it?
I don't know.
I think it's pine disinfectant.
Might be nothing.
Let's find out when the cabins are cleaned.
Who's got a car?
Say again?
Who's got a car?
If Megan was killed in there, somebody could have kept her there and waited till it was late enough to drive her to the pier.
Well, there's a staff car and the keys are kept behind the reception desk and all staff do have access, within reason.
That'll be it.
It's my turn!
Come here.
It's my turn.
But it's mine.
He's had it all day.
The pair of yous better pack it in, right.
But Dad!
Sir?
The lab report's back.
It's a match.
The blood in the car was the same type as Megan's.
124 witness statements and nobody saw a thing.
Well, not yet.
Where's John?
I'm not sure.
He, um...
Well, he disappeared when he heard that there was a solicitor in the building.
I'm not sure what it's about, but...
Sorry.
Oh, great.
You don't know what you're talking about.
You're an idiot!
I'm just telling you how it is.
He's an idiot, him.
Doesn't know what he's talking about.
I take it you cornered him about Leigh-Anne.
Yeah.
And he says the only option I have is to take Lisa to court and even then, right, statistically,
I have a minuscule chance of winning.
And either way, I've got to pay the court costs.
So, not only will I end up exactly where I started... ..I'll be bankrupt.
It's great, innit, that?
Terrific.
So, what does he recommend?
He doesn't.
He told me to forget it.
So I told him to shove his clipboard up his stupid...
John.
John.
John!
John!
Not here.
Sorry.
Why don't you go and talk to Lisa again?
I can't do that.
Why not?
Because, apparently, I scare her and she doesn't want me around.
It's ridiculous.
Oh, don't mind me.
I'm only Leigh-Anne's dad.
Just the hapless father, that's all.
Where was Gary Manners on Saturday night?
Oh, look at this, man.
She keeps shifting...
John!
Where was Gary Manners on Saturday night?
Er, oh, yeah...
Him and Justine were on stage at the camp from six till last orders.
Don't they ever give them a break?
I don't think so.
They treat them like pack-horses.
Don't even have time to eat.
How did you get on with Stretch's wife?
Sir, there was no answer on the phone, so I popped round and spoke to a neighbour, who said that Mrs Stretch and his daughters had left months ago.
Did they, indeed?
Oh, yeah, and I also called the village hairdressers about Mrs Webb and asked about her wig.
Well, hairdressers know everything, especially local hair-associated facts.
Well, childbirth.
All of her hair fell out when she gave birth to Megan.
She's been wearing a wig ever since.
It's always been a problem between mother and daughter, apparently.
That's great.
Innit?
That's amazing.
Really exemplary work there, WPC Coles.
Tell us something.
Were you one of those kids that wore their school uniform at the weekends?
Would you excuse us for a moment, please, Rachel.
Bright and female.
She really rattled your cage, didn't she?
No, no, it's not that.
She's just an arrogant know-all.
She's over you like a rash.
John...
She's all like, "Oh, Mr Gently, sir..."
John, John.
I feel for you, I really do.
Not seeing Leigh-Anne, it's grossly unfair...
What would you know about it?
You're not a father.
Thanks for that.
But that does not give you permission to come here and make everybody feel as diminished as you clearly do.
You get back to the holiday camp.
You're more use there than here.
Give it a day or two, most of these campers will be gone.
You don't know that.
I admire your optimism.
Tea?
No.
Not for me.
Where's Gary Manners right about now.
He's proving to be a bit elusive.
On his way to the dancehall, I should imagine.
Whipping up our campers into a heightened state of euphoria.
Really?
How long have you been married?
16 years.
To Kitty.
Two children, if indeed that was to be your next question.
Dorothy and Heather, 14 and 12.
Do you get home much?
Well, I work hard, Sergeant.
Is that why she left?
Ah, come on, man.
That piece of information's not going to pass us by, is it?
It's a murder investigation.
Look...
I don't want anyone to know.
Even my sister doesn't know.
I had to give Kitty some money to keep quiet.
I am a family man.
Was.
Does beg the question, though, doesn't it?
What you were really doing on Saturday night?
What is this?
I've always loved Kiss Me Kate.
Perhaps you could enlighten me about Saturday night's production.
I got drunk and slept here on the sofa.
It happens a little too often.
I was embarrassed.
You were at the camp all evening?
Yes.
Did you go anywhere?
Answer the question.
In the dancehall, there's a corner of the wings where I can stand without being seen.
I make notes.
The show has to be perfect.
Efficiency is everything if we are to maintain the numbers.
Standards need to be high.
Was Megan performing?
Yes.
You lied during the murder investigation of your own daughter.
If I'd told you where I was, you would have assumed the worst!
I always assume the worst of everybody.
I didn't kill her!
You know what?
I don't believe you.
Oh, there I go again...
I didn't kill her!
How could I?
Well, you had enough of a reason.
People don't need much, surprisingly.
It was a shock...when she left, yes?
Yes.
I felt like I wanted to die, actually.
It didn't make you happy, knowing that your only daughter was following her dream?
I told you before, Inspector, I thought it was an indulgence.
She wanted lessons after school.
Ballet, tap, singing, acting.
Instead, Patrick whisked her off to his sister for extra Latin classes.
She's an exemplary Latin teacher, his sister.
No social graces though, so I keep my distance when possible.
Well, Megan must have been naturally talented then, cos she didn't have any training or crafting of her talent.
Apparently so.
What did you want to do when you were a little girl?
Er...
I liked to tell stories.
Ah.
I was good at the voices.
My mum and dad used to wheel me out at parties.
I had some... ..ambition, you might say.
But it was not to be.
You lost your hair?
After I gave birth to Megan... ..pretty as a picture, I was not.
Would you say your daughter was as pretty as a picture?
Of course I would!
And clearly she had the talent.
She was all set to have the career that you could never have.
Yes, yes.
All right!
You went to the camp, didn't you?
Temptation got the better of me.
I just... ..wanted to see her sing.
Saturday night?
Right, campers, we know you're desperate to see the next act, so please put your hands together for the late-night version of the After Dark Bluebirds, led by our very own Megan Webb!

Any mistakes?
There's always room for polish.
Tighter footwork.
Wider smiles.
Why did your wife leave you?
It's ironic.
One fights to maintain the perfect family holiday and in doing so, destroys one's own precious little unit.
You wouldn't understand precious if it came up and hit you in the face.
I beg your pardon?
You sit there, talking about how important family is to you, when all the time, you were having it off with Megan Webb.
No, I wasn't.
Yes, you were.
I just wouldn't!
You're lying!
Again!
This may come as a surprise to you, Sergeant, but we are not all unfaithful.
Not all of us.
My weakness is this camp.
My father's camp.
I just want it to work.
And I can't fail.
I just can't.
Do you know what?
I came to this camp a few years back.
Really?
Yep.
Me, the wife, my daughter.
We had a great time.
I remember how busy it was.
It was absolutely packed with families.
Not so packed any more.
Your camp's dying, isn't it?
Hardly that.
Come on, man, this is 1969.
Family's not what it used to be.
I should know.
People don't want to come to holiday camps any more, they want to go further afield.
Your dancehall seems busy enough.
Your dining room, all that.
You've disguised those bits very well...
No, it is not a disguise!
It is clever programming.
We lead our campers like horses to water.
One big event on the hour, every hour.
If a room is full, they'll be happy, and they will keep coming back.
You'd do anything to save this camp, wouldn't you?
Did Patrick know you went?
Megan... ..obviously wanted me to come.
I was rather touched.
She wrote more than once?
Yes.
Every week.
But I couldn't write back.
Why not?
I didn't want to engage.
She'd...disobeyed me.
But then she told me an agent was coming.
An agent?
Yes.
Someone local had seen her, told someone else.
I thought, she must be...passable, if someone's coming to see her.
Did you speak to her?
After the show.
What time was this?
I suppose... ..9.20pm, 9.25pm, maybe?
Mum...
I won't come in.
What are you doing here?
I just came to see you sing a couple of songs and to say... yeah, well done.
Mum, please come in.
No, I couldn't possibly.
You came to see me.
Thought it was about time.
Got my letters, then?
Did the agent come?
You said in your letter...
Um...
I was cross with you.
Every week I write, and nothing.
I just found myself writing that, and...
I see.
No agent?
Oh, well.
That'll serve me right for not writing back.
I might not stay here, Mum.
Why?
I can't explain, really.
Mum, can I come home?
Home?
No.
No, darling, you can't.
I really should go.
Mum!
Mum...
Why'd you say no?
Because she was too good.
Oh.
She was so good, in fact, that I realised she was absolutely right, to have left home, gone to the camp.
It was a perfect platform for her.
She couldn't give it up and come home.
I wouldn't allow it.
If I didn't know you better,
I'd say you were starting to sound like a proud mum.
I don't know about that.
Oh, come on, Agnes.
"Come on" what, Mr Gently?
Do I regret not telling her that?
Absolutely that?
That I was proud of her?
Proud of her...beautiful performance?
I think so, yes.
Yes.
And regret can make a person... ..very, very angry and bitter.
Well... ..at least you went to see her.
That would have meant something to her.
You think?
Hmm.
Yeah, maybe.
But I didn't take her home with me, Inspector.
I didn't do as she asked.
We've lost our baby, Patrick.
Our baby.
She was such a good dancer.
I so wished you could have seen her.
I think it's what they call a cack-handed approach.
It was clumsy, certainly.
Just makes me laugh.
Does he think for one moment that him turning up like that is going to make me go, "Oh, yeah, all right, then.
"Just because you asked so nicely."
John has got a particular way with words.
That's one way of putting it.
Oh, he's always been like this, hasn't he?
Gets in a rage, because he doesn't know what else to do.
But, you know, Lisa, underneath all of that... ..he might just have...
What?
..a point.
A point?
Yeah.
Oh, no.
The amount of contact he has with Leigh-Anne is pitiful, Lisa.
It just is.
Is that what this is about?
This is why you asked us to meet?
I'll get us another drink.
I can't explain now...
I think it's best if we just get home as quick as we can...
Ah, we meet again.
I missed you.
I'll bet.
I mustn't dawdle.
Campers to entertain.
Everyone in this camp seems to think that you and Megan had a relationship except for you.
It's funny that, isn't it?
Yeah?
Well, I don't call a couple of nights in a cold, unoccupied cabin a relationship.
Maybe, you do.
How sweet(!
)
Someone even said that you were in love with her.
Who?
Oh, fascinating.
Meaning?
So many untruths whizzing about this camp, Sergeant.
Were you angry or upset when she ended it?
No.
Dear me, you're a terrible liar.
Why did she end it?
I don't know.
I don't care.
Well, you either genuinely don't know, in which case, you're thick, or you do know and you're just not telling me, in which case, you're a bit stupid.
Must be difficult in that dancehall without her.
Off you pop.
Will you think about it?
There's nothing to think about.
I disagree.
This has nothing to do with you, George.
Well, not directly, no.
But I think I know something of what John's going through.
I know what it's like to feel...
What?
Isabella died five years ago yesterday.
About this time, actually.
George, I'm sorry.
No, it's all right.
It's all right.
Well, it's not.
Lisa, I don't have a family... ..as John so kindly pointed out to me yesterday but what he doesn't know is that we did try.
For years.
We did all the tests, all of it, but...
And I think I would have made an all-right dad.
But...
Let him do it, Lisa.
George...
Something's got to give.
He could see Leigh-Anne more, couldn't he?
We've got a routine now.
This is not about routine.
This is about control.
I don't like the way you're saying that.
Why?
Why couldn't he see more of her?
Because seeing her so little, it's making his heart freeze, Lisa.
And he's her dad.
She's his little girl.
You can't change that.
You can't take that away from him.
Or her.
You look like the boss to me.
Not the other one.
Hello, there.
Just something about the way you hold yourself.
It's fun here when the sun starts to fade, isn't it?
Depends what you mean by fun.
Oh, holiday camps are all about sunshine, blue skies.
Smiling faces, colour, laughing...
It's a well-trodden path but when the night falls, we don't think about the shadows.
Let me ask you something.
Why did you lie to us when we first questioned you about Gary?
You said that Megan wasn't seeing anyone.
She wasn't, they'd split up.
Clever clogs.
What are you doing, Justine?
Well, it's my evening off.
I came out for a fag but I can't be seen loitering.
So, I'd appreciate it if miraculously you'd forgotten you'd seen us.
You and Megan were good friends, were you?
Do we have to talk about this now?
Go down the station, talk about it there if you fancy.
Well, I liked her a lot.
She knew who she was, what she was doing here.
It's an over-used term, Sergeant, but Megan was a good person.
A friend.
What about Gail?
Was she jealous at all about your friendship?
Gail's young.
I think she's used to being the underdog, but I'm... ..I'm working on her.
I used to be a bit like that... ..like Gail...
..and then I came here and everything changed.
I can't imagine you ever being like Gail.
Oh, I'd surprise you, Sergeant.
Gary and Megan were in a relationship, were they?
Yeah, everyone knows that.
Why did she dump him?
Nobody answers that question.
Why will nobody answer that question?
I don't know why she dumped him.
She was so into him.
So excited when he first showed an interest in her.
He singled her out... ..invited her to this party where it all began.
We got her ready.
I lent her a dress.
♪ Sugar
♪ Oh, honey, honey
♪ You are my candy girl
♪ And you got me wanting you
♪ Honey... ♪
That's better.
It's all about accentuation.
Isn't it a bit much?
No.
It's actually perfect.
Now, can you see what can be done?
Anything's possible...
Yeah, but I haven't even got the basics.
Oh, we can create the basics.
Trust me.
MUSIC: "Ha!
Ha!
Said The Clown" by Manfred Mann
Go and get a drink.
See what happens.
MUSIC: "Build Me Up Buttercup" by The Foundations
Look and learn, Gail.
Look and learn.
Well, they'd been seeing each other a couple of weeks and she suddenly went cold on him.
Did she find out he was seeing anybody else?
Anything like that?
I don't know.
I think you do.
Well, you would.
It's your job to be suspicious.
Come on, pet.
Sorry to disappoint.
Were you on stage all night on Saturday?
Yeah, between six and midnight.
Didn't leave the dancehall ever?
No.
Sure?
Absolutely.
I hate to admit it but I'm rather frightened, Sergeant.
It could happen again, couldn't it?
I'd get inside if I were you, pet.
Till we've made an arrest, this camp might not be the safest place to be.
Ta-ra.
Why did Megan want to leave that camp?
Something changed.
And something's bothering me.
The staff didn't know about Megan's murder until about ten the next morning.
Right?
Yeah, about that...
And the newspapers arrive at 11 o'clock, yeah?
Yeah, they get delivered to the cabins.
So by mid-morning, everybody knows.
Yes?
Yeah.
Right, well... there's a list of families who tried to check out of the camp before they were interviewed.
Nothing too troubling about that.
They wanted to get the hell out of there, I don't blame them.
But one family were recorded by the...
John, listen.
One family were recorded by the receptionist as desperately trying to leave at quarter past ten, Monday morning,
45 minutes before the newspapers arrived.
Yeah, and there's no radios in any of the cabins.
Sylvia and Timothy Ryan.
Cabin Red 4?
No, no, I remember now.
There was no answer when I was doing my checks.
Bring them both in - separate interviews.
Don't worry, Mr Ryan, you'll be next.
Got any children?
Yeah.
Like that, is it?
Well, life changes after kids.
Some people say for the better.
Well, it depends on your point of view.
People shouldn't have kids if they don't want them.
No-one tells you they destroy your lives.
You know what?
I hope your kids never ever hear you say that.
Oh, it's always the dads who judge the most.
And the ones who see the kids the least.
Do you know what...
Right, let's just stick to the point, shall we?
Is he staying?
Yes.
Now, where were you on Saturday night, Mrs Ryan?
I was at the camp.
Where do you think I was?
Don't get smart.
What were you doing around 9.30?
I can't remember.
Think!
Yeah, I...
I called my mum.
Tim was on his way to the dancehall,
I remember I needed to call my mum.
What about?
This and that.
Give me the number.
What?
Your mother's number.
Well, presumably she would have remembered the phone call.
So, I'll ask you again.
I went to a cabin, to meet a fella... ..a Bluebird.
Who?
His name was...
Gary.
Gary Manners?
I don't know his second name.
Gary Manners!
I'd been at the camp a week and on the second night we got chatting and we hit it off.
This was our third date, of sorts.
What time was this?
I met him around...ten.
There was a competition.
The campers got 20 minutes to dance for the judges.
Gary could come off stage - he slipped away and no-one noticed.
Go on.
Well, I met him in his cabin.
We were...
Making daisy chains.
Yeah, I know.
I get it.
When this music suddenly started, really loud - coming from a cabin nearby.
What's the matter?
It's coming from Meg's cabin.
Oh, we've only got 15 minutes!
She needs to turn it down.
No, it'll be fine.
She needs to turn it down!
Meg, what are you doing?
Turn it down.
Meg, what are you playing at?
Turn it down!
Thank you.
Meg?
Hello?
'How long was the music playing for?
'
Minute and a half - maybe less.
And how long were you and Gary...?
15 minutes.
Then what?
I ran back to the dance hall.
What about Gary?
Yeah, he went there too.
Just...different route.
Did you see him go?
No, but five minutes later he were on the stage.
Five minutes?
Why did you try and check out early?
Gary came to find me, when the staff had heard about the girl... the dead girl.
Well, the music we heard, Gary thought it were a bit odd.
It was too loud, out of character.
We wondered if... ..we'd witnessed something.
And you couldn't tell us because your husband would find out.
But what about Gary?
I don't know.
Because she's not Gary's usual fare, is she?
I beg your pardon.
I mean, look at her.
He could have anyone.
That's just insulting!
At least I've not got a face that looks like a horse's head caught in a clamp.
Clever.
And you'd be surprised - a lot of men like a bit of flesh.
But not Gary, eh?
I don't know what you mean.
Yes, you do.
You paid him for the sex, didn't you?
The lying git.
Megan must have found out about him.
It's not the kind of thing you want to hear about your nice new boyfriend, is it?
You're looking forward to this, aren't you?
Yeah.
Right, last six!
Three... five...
Well done.
Good, well done.
Good workout!
Star pupil!
Whoo!
Oh, God, I think I'm going to throw up.
Gary, put it away, man, will you?
I want a word with you.
I'm busy!
Now, please.
Where's the fire, gentlemen?
It's not a good look in front of the campers.
Did you sleep with Sylvia Ryan?
I need to get on, got back-to-back classes.
Well, I'll take that as a yes then.
Look, we could do this down at the station, if you like.
And there, I guarantee, you will start sweating.
It's just a bit of fun.
Do it often?
I'm a consenting adult.
Indeed you are.
But unfortunately you consented to take money for it, didn't you?
Did Megan find out and threaten to tell somebody about it?
Hey, is that why you killed her, Gary?
I wouldn't hurt Megan!
Not in a million years.
See, at the moment,
I don't believe a single word that comes out of your mouth.
First you're not seeing Megan, then you are.
You didn't leave the dancehall, then you did.
Add that to your vice activity, you're already looking at a jail term.
I didn't kill her.
Yeah, right.
I didn't kill her!
You're a smarmy git, you are, Gary.
You want to watch yourself, all roads seem to be leading to you.
Because I had some assignations, I'm capable of murder?
How many times do I need to say it?
You want to back off, man, all right?
You've got this very wrong.
You were very fond of Megan, weren't you?
Yeah, I know.
OK.
Did she find out that you were accepting money for sex?
Yes.
Who else knew?
Who else knew?
No-one.
You're lying.
I'm not.
See, I'm better at this than you are, Gary.
Now, there is something.
Isn't there?
There's something around the notion of who else knew.
Because why would you lie?
Who are you protecting?
You weren't the only one.
Were you, Gary?
Thanks, Gary.
I'm lost.
Stretch is running a knocking shop, John, right here in the camp.
Are you quite serious?
This is a family holiday camp, Inspector, it slightly misses the point.
I suggest you wipe that grin off your face and take a seat, Mr Stretch.
Gary Manners regularly slept with female campers for money.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Well, I think you do, Mr Stretch.
Was Megan a part of this?
What?
Was she one of your girls?
Cherry, Inspector Gently is under the misguided and quite frankly ludicrous impression that this camp is gaining from immoral earnings.
Would you kindly tell him that we know nothing of any prostitution.
Who told you that?
Gary Manners gave himself away.
Gary likes the sound of his own voice.
Bit of a boaster.
So you knew nothing about this?
Nothing at all?
Because Gary says he wasn't the only one.
I had to do something.
There were these loan sharks and they needed cash fast.
What are you saying?
Todd knew nothing about this.
What have you done?
The camp was failing, Todd.
We would have failed.
What have you done?
!
The camp was going under, Todd - the whole thing!
Families weren't coming any more.
We were that close.
I had to keep it afloat!
No, Cherry...not like this.
This is all we have.
This is all we are!
You're so naive, Todd.
It's business, just business.
I know it's hard, but we needed the cash.
We'd be dead otherwise.
Sit down, Mr Stretch.
How did you...market this business?
We watched, at meal-times, the couples who were struggling.
The men who looked straight past their own wives, so they could get a good look at someone else's.
Oh, it's everywhere, Inspector - unhappy couples.
Especially on holiday... all that flesh, every flaw exposed.
And what about Megan?
What about her?
Come on, Cherry, there's more.
What about Megan?
I invited her to join us.
Well, I didn't, Gary did.
We'd set the whole thing up.
I thought if she fell in love with Gary, she'd be more pliable.
Did Megan refuse to get involved?
We'd never been turned down before, we selected carefully.
She put a value on herself and it was beyond money.
And did she threaten to blow the whistle?
Yes.
Did you kill her?
No.
I was at my wit's end, yes, needed her to shut up.
We all needed her to shut up and then... ..you came and she was dead.
You say you selected carefully.
How?
They had to be... ..um...pretty... ambitious... girls and boys.
They had to be 16 and over, I was very strict about that.
16 or over?
Gail?
Justine, would you mind for a minute?
Whose is this?
It's mine.
Why was it in Justine's drawer?
Don't look at her.
She said I didn't need it any more.
Why?
Gail...
Justine, shut it.
Because I'm a grown-up now.
In what way?
Gail, a girl has died...
Megan has died.
Now, we know that some of the Bluebirds were involved with men and women who paid them for sex.
She wasn't part of it.
Yeah, I was.
Cherry didn't know, Cherry thought I were too young.
But Justine thought I were ready.
Justine, did you set Gail up with clients?
Did Megan find out?
She's 15!
She's a child!
Megan cared about that, didn't she?
There's one thing finding out her mates were sleeping with campers.
But this was too much, wasn't it?
Gail dropped the money.
She shouldn't have dropped the money!
MUSIC: "Sugar, Sugar" by The Archies
Meg, I thought you were in the staff room.
I'm not going.
Why?
What are you two doing back?
Sneaked out.
Gail fancies the new kitchen porter.
Don't you, Gail?
I said I'd redo her hair for the late shift.
Right, you, hairbrush.
Sit.
They're only on that dance floor for 16 minutes.
Then I'll be right back on that stage.
I'm sure she can do her own hair.
Only Justine can do it for me.
Is it yours?
No.
I'm asking Gail.
Gail?
No.
She's started?
Is that what you're doing, now?
You're getting her ready for a punter?
You should go back to work.
What about you?
Just go, now.
She wanted to get started.
She's just a kid.
I'm helping her out!
Really?
You really think that?
Meg, don't be angry.
I'm helping her feel beautiful.
You actually enjoy it, don't you?
What?
You actually enjoy dressing up a 15-year-old girl as your doll and sending her off to have sex with oily, bloated campers.
I turned her into something, I did that.
She was nothing.
Wow.
You're a star-maker...
You really need to be quiet.
..making dreams come true(!
)
Except this isn't Hollywood Boulevard, it's a holiday camp.
You need to shut your mouth.
Gail is too young!
I'm calling the police, you whore!
No, you're...
Meg, what are you doing?
Turn it down.
Meg, what are you playing at?
Turn it down!
Thank you.
'Why didn't you just report Megan's death as an accident?
'
Meg?
'And take the chance 'the police would come and find out about the other stuff?
'
'And then?
'
I stood there in the dark.
The door went again and I thought it was Gary.
But it was me.
I was worried about Justine.
You came out twice?
We've got statements.
People said you were in the kitchen all night.
I'm the girl nobody notices.
I slipped away just fine.
Hello?
Justine... ..where's Meg?
Don't switch the light on.
What's going on?
Something happened and there was an accident.
Megan was going to call the police.
So I just...
She fell.
What do you mean?
She's dead.
What?
No, you need to be quiet.
You need to be very, very quiet.
Everything that happens in the next five minutes is really, really important.
And you need to do everything I say, right?
Everything.
We need to get back to work.
So...help me push her under the bed and we can...we can deal with her later.
What?
Right?
Come on, under the bed.
No, don't get any blood on you!
Don't.
Gail, get back to work.
Hurry.
Well, Justine killed Megan.
That wasn't your problem.
I had to help.
What, you have to do everything she says?
Sleep with men when she says?
Move bodies when she says?
I don't know...
You're upsetting her.
You made her an accessory to murder!
And after Gail helped, you went back to the dancehall.
Yeah?
Yes.
Well, somebody must have noticed you were late.
We looked after each other.
Where have you been?
Last-minute appointment.
You're all right.
Didn't know you had one.
Spontaneity's my middle name.
The old boys love it.
That's why I'm earning more money than you.
Well, what about the delicious Sylvia Ryan?
Aye.
Except Megan was playing her music full blast.
It was distracting.
Right.
I need to talk to her.
Yeah, you should.
But I... ..I think she's getting an early night.
Maybe you should try her tomorrow.
Right, ladies and gentlemen, that is your 20 minutes' dance time up.
So I hope you had a good time down there because I certainly enjoyed watching you all.
'What about the body?
'
'We waited till three o'clock in the morning.'
For Cherry, it was all about business.
This one...
this one was something different.
I think she saw herself as some kind of Svengali.
I wonder what Stretch'll do now.
Camp's a goner, isn't it?
30 years of family holidays, how ironic.
Oh, speaking of joyous family life,
Lisa called, left a message.
What?
Yeah.
What did she want?
She's dropping off Leigh-Anne in about half an hour.
No, I'm not seeing her for three week.
I don't know, something about a new deal.
Every other weekend, I think she said.
You're joking?
I'm not.
You're joking!
No, I'm not.
Why...why's she changed her mind?
I don't know, John.
I've got to go.
Night, John.
Here's my girl!
Give us a hug!
Oh!
Thanks for that, it means everything.
Have a nice evening.
Excuse me.
Yes.
I want you off this beach now, please.
Have a bit of respect, all right?
It's not a sight for children is it?
Some people!
Bob, Bob, I want these people off that pier, all right?
I want the whole pier cleared.
Can you move off the pier, please?
Quickly now!
Sorry, we're moving.
We're moving on.
Thank you.
Hello there.
Hiya.
Is she on her own?
Yeah.
My name's John.
Are you all right?
Where's your mummy and daddy?
They're asleep.
Asleep?
So did you bring out the dog for a walk on your own?
Do you know what, if you were my little lass,
I wouldn't let you out of my sight.
ICE-CREAM VAN JINGLE PLAYS
I'd also buy you a big fat massive ice cream...
I think it might be a little bit too early.
What do you think?
No, it's not!
No, not too early?
Come on then, let's go and get one.
There we go.
Morning, Sir.
Nice day for it.
About 16 to 17 by the looks of it.
She's no ID, but there's a massive blow to the side of the head.
Think she was dead before she hit the water.
She's wearing a Bluebird Holiday Camp uniform.
Can't have been in the water very long.
Time of death is...
Oh, I dunno, some time today, early hours of the morning, something like that.
What do you think?
You all right?
Get her in.
Right, I'll get the lads.
All right, let's get her in.
Any witnesses?
Not yet, no.
Old fella said he saw a young couple down here last night.
Could've been her...
With a bloke - things get out of hand, you know.
Description fit?
Not really, no.
Was dark though.
Is that all you've got?
Give us a chance, sir, will you?
You searched the pier?
What?
The pier.
Have you searched the pier?
No, not yet.
Something tells me that the beach is the priority, Guv.
And something tells me you've not heard of longshore drift.
That body travelled inland.
You'd dump her at the furthest point, of course, closest to the open sea - gives her a better chance of drifting away.
But you'd be very wrong cos the current would just take her straight round, right where she was found.
A pier at night can house all sorts.
Meaning?
It's more private than the beach.
Perfect for an illicit night-time stroll, over the waves.
Very romantic.
Sounds like you've been there and done that.
I might have known a late-night stroll along the pier in my time, John.
Really?
I don't have you down as a man who likes it al fresco.
Now, there's a line.
And I just crossed it.
You've just...
Yeah, absolutely.
Sorry.
I want every inch of this pier searched.
All right.
Sorry.
Bluebird's eh?
Yeah.
Bluebird's three or four miles that way.
We went there, you know, me and Lisa.
Did you?
Mmm, a few years back.
It was good.
Just after Leigh-Anne was born.
We went to a holiday camp right after the war.
Never seen so many families in one place, you know, enjoying themselves for the first time.
A whole new world.
BACCHUS SIGHS
Are you missing Leigh-Anne?
Yeah.
I've not seen her for three week.
Can you believe that?
That's not enough, is it?
No, it's not enough.
I'm fine when I'm not thinking about her.
You know, I'm fine then.
But you think about her all the time.
Yeah.
Isabel!
Sorry.
Welcome to Bluebird!
Can I help you, gentlemen?
Wives powdering their noses in the car, and children causing mischief after a long drive, I'll bet?
Let me get someone to help you with your bags.
No, thank you.
I'm DCI Gently.
Could we speak to the manager, please?
Of course.
Well, would you like a lift?
No, thank you.
We'll walk.
I'll show you the way.
Go!
One, two, three, four, five, six...
FAIRGROUND ORGAN PLAYS
Sorry to disturb, Miss Stretch, these gentlemen wish to see Mr Stretch.
They're policeman.
Thank you, Justine.
Detective Chief Inspector Gently.
Cherry.
This is Detective Sergeant Bacchus.
My brother Todd shouldn't be long.
It's all a bit manic here today.
The body of a young woman was found this morning.
We believe that she worked here.
Obviously we're very anxious to identify her.
Anyone missing?
I'm...
I'm sorry?
Body was found on the beach near the pier.
Why do you think she worked here?
She wore a Bluebird uniform.
Right.
Anyone missing, to your knowledge?
Well...
I don't know.
Staff rotas aren't really my thing.
Might need to try harder than that.
All my workers live on site.
There's a late-comers board.
If someone hasn't clocked in, then their name get's chalked up.
Good.
Shall we?
Hello, Mr Stretch.
Sophie.
Sally.
Do you live on site, Mr Stretch?
No.
I live at home with my wife and two daughters.
I'm very lucky.
Business good?
Chin up, Lottie.
Oh, yes.
We are a powerhouse, gentlemen - built from dust.
But a few loans started my father off, and he opened the doors in '36.
No-one had ever seen anything quite like it.
Family holidays for the masses.
We've been full to bursting ever since.
You know there is a great pleasure in having to turn punters away.
Here we are.
Ah, Megan.
Blue for Bluebird?
Yes.
Does she live with anybody, share a room?
Justine Leyland, I believe.
Senior Bluebird.
We've met her already.
Ah, yes.
She's been scooping up the new arrivals, and hurling them into a dance competition to whet their appetite.
I think the Bluebirds will be arriving in the dance hall now.
Thank you.
Inspector?
Yes.
Now, we can keep all this a little...
low, can't we?
I'm sorry?
People are on their holidays.
Yes?
Well, this is a camp of smiles.
It's a holiday from their grey little lives.
We don't want a gloomy little storm cloud gathering.
Are you asking us to protect your business, Mr Stretch?
Simply asking for a little discretion.
I don't think you've quite got it yet, have you?
A member of your staff has been found dead.
We need staff rotas, the names of everybody who was working last night.
Oh, and the guests.
Of course.
We need the names of all the guests.
Dance hall, you said?
MUSIC: "Helpless" by Kim Weston
I'm happy to be the girl if you fancy a dance.
No, you're all right, thank you very much.
Lisa and I won this, you know.
Did you?
Won the cup in this very room.
She's a good mover is Lisa.
Really cracking little dancer.
I mean, she wouldn't have won the cup without me.
Is that right?
Yeah.
Fred Astaire of the North-East, me.
Look at the moves.
Quality.
Well, much as I'd like to stand here and admire your...fluidity.
Well done, campers!
Wow, are you all trained or something?
They said that when we were here.
So, the dance competition is now closed, so now we have the Bluebird Boppers while our judges make their decision and it won't be long till this little cup get's given to one lucky family.
Could we have a word, please?
Inspector?
Somewhere quieter.
So, ladies and gentlemen, a big hand for the Bluebird Boppers!
CHEERING
So, your cabin mate Megan Webb...
What about her?
She didn't come to work this morning.
Yeah, well, she's always late.
She'll stroll in any minute looking immaculate.
Do you share a cabin?
There's three of us.
Who's the third?
Gail.
Little kitchen maid.
Buried in chip fat, as we speak, lucky old thing.
When's the last time that you saw Megan?
Be last night, on stage.
She'd finished after the first show.
Did she come back here at all last night?
No.
Was she meeting anybody?
Well, she didn't say she was.
What's going on?
We're just making some enquiries.
Really?
Two plain-clothes detectives?
We've found a body - a girl.
She was wearing a Bluebird uniform.
Long blonde hair, very pretty.
No!
What was Megan wearing when you saw her last?
Er...
Her uniform.
She'd just finished her shift.
Was that the last time you saw her?
I told you, she didn't come back last night.
You didn't report her?
I'm her friend, so, no.
That's what we do.
She's got enough black marks next to her name as it is.
Did she have a boyfriend?
Not that I know of.
Are you sure?
I told you, I don't know.
Well, thank you, you'll want to be getting back to announce those winners.
Until we've spoken to the family, got a positive ID...
You want me to keep me mouth shut.
Well, it might not be her.
Yeah, but it might.
Yeah.
MUSIC: "Heaven Must Have Sent You" by Bonnie Pointer
Lisa, it's me.
Yeah.
Listen,
I was wondering if I could see Leigh-Anne this weekend?
I know it's not my weekend.
Right.
No, no, I can't wait three weeks.
It's not fair.
Why?
I know what the agreement is, Lisa.
Once a month's not enough, it's nowhere near, it's not even close.
No, no, I'm her dad, Lisa.
I'm her dad!
And I only get to see her 12 times a year.
12 - it's ridiculous!
No, listen...
I don't think you realise how ridi...
Oh, you stupid...!
She hung up on us.
Can you believe that?
Must be your softly-softly approach, John.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means easy does it.
Come on.
Pathology report's back.
John?
Huh?
Sorry, go on.
No sign of rape, or sexual assault.
She wasn't a virgin.
And no water in the lungs.
Well, that means she'd have been dead when she hit the water, doesn't it?
Very.
It'd only been there a few hours.
Time of death was between eight and ten on Saturday evening.
It'd have been busy in the pier, Saturday night.
I don't think she died on the pier, John.
I think she was killed somewhere else, kept there for eight or so hours, and then taken to the pier, dumped over the side.
Somebody hoped that she would just drift away without a trace.
That's a bit stupid, that, isn't it?
Yeah, very.
What happens now?
Well, can we drive you home?
I've got the car.
Don't you want to talk to us?
We can do that later.
I want to do it now.
Agnes...
Well, what are we going to do?
Go home, chop some vegetables, put the radio on?
Darling...
Inspector?
She told us at dinner... ..about the job at the camp.
It was my birthday.
I'd made a quiche Lorraine.
One always hopes that someone else will cook on your birthday, but not this time.
Megan!
On the table!
Megan!
Megan.
Patrick, did you polish both serving spoons?
Yes, I think so...
You think?
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
When you ask if you can help, dear, and then don't do the very thing that I ask, there really is very little point, is there?
Have we got any butter?
There's already butter on the potatoes.
I'd like to put a bit more on.
You heard your mother, you don't need any more.
I'd like some more, please.
Run along and get it then.
We'll wait till you return.
I've got a job at the Bluebird Holiday Camp.
And so it began.
She left when?
The following morning.
She was resolute.
She took the bus.
The blue one, with the flaky upholstery.
When was this?
About two months ago.
And you haven't seen her since?
No.
Did you visit her at the camp?
No.
Thank you, Rachel.
Was this new, this desire to break free?
The last two years have been rather disruptive, Inspector.
Cos we...we moved, from London to Newcastle - from a dear little house in Richmond.
Nice neighbours, everything just as we wanted it.
And Patrick got a promotion up here.
He's from Newcastle, you see.
And then after the move,
Megan did become perhaps a little surly, but then she did have dreams of achieving something which was just beyond the realms of possibility.
What was that?
She wanted to become an actress, a performer.
You didn't approve?
It's a wildly frivolous occupation, Inspector, bound in... ..uncertainty and self-indulgence and those who really need it are fragile creatures, in my opinion.
"Look at me!" Isn't that what it's saying?
Perhaps.
Was she good at it?
What?
Megan, was she any good?
Was she a good performer?
I've no idea.
But the notion of her wanting to get a job at the camp to achieve her dreams was quite frankly laughable.
Why was that?
The Bluebird Holiday Camp is hardly the Royal Shakespeare Company, is it?
It's a playground for those with less than Patrick and I.
We prefer to holiday at Whitby.
Wonderful steam train.
I love steam trains.
Did she contact you after she got to the camp or while she was there?
She wrote.
Once.
Can we see it, that letter?
I don't have it.
I saw no reason to keep it.
Was she precious to you, your daughter?
What sort of a question is that?
Well, parents don't usually throw away their children's letters, do they?
Especially if they haven't seen them for a few weeks, their only daughter.
She was enjoying being amongst all those campers, enjoying the hysteria.
I saw no reason to read that letter more than once.
Right, one more question.
What were you both doing last night?
What, pray, are you suggesting?
Just answer the question, please.
We went to the theatre.
At the village hall.
Amateur dramatic production of Kiss Me Kate - it was rather good.
Thank you.
I'd run away to a holiday camp if that was the alternative.
Indeed.
She didn't seem very upset, did she?
Visibly unmoved, I'd say.
Methodical.
Taut.
We'd better check their alibi.
I could do that.
All right.
I've got it.
You still here?
I'm compartmentalising.
What?
Well, er, your filing system is, um, questionable...
Sir.
Is it now?
No, it's not.
It's not?
No.
Well, you see, Detective Sergeant, I would be interested in your definition of an operational filing system when there appears to be a lack of any files.
It's all right.
It's all there.
Yeah, well, it's all there, yeah, but in what semblance of order because, well, ideally if we could actually locate the information that we do have, well, it might give us more time to look for the information we don't have.
Well, it's really that simple, I'd say.
Well, you carry on, Rachel.
I, for one, am glad you're here.
For one.
Oi!
She was wearing a good wig, Mrs Webb.
What relevance is that?
Probably none.
I never noticed she was wearing a wig.
Well, that's because you're a man, sir.
Is that a fact?
Well, Rachel, you coordinate with Sergeant Bacchus, I'd like you with us.
We're going to need help speaking to everybody in the camp and nobody is to check out until they've been interviewed.
Take that.
"Semblance of order", huh?
She's only been here two minutes, man, she's fiddling around with everything.
Calm down.
She's a good copper.
Aye, so everyone keeps telling us.
I don't see it, myself.
I mean, it's nice to have somebody here to make a cup of tea, she'd be good for that, granted.
I wanted her here.
We don't need her.
Well, I say we do, John.
Oh, well, you would.
She thinks you walk on water.
Are you jealous?
What?
You know, bright young spark, hard worker.
What are you saying?
You know what I'm saying.
You might want to step up, John.
Put a bit of seniority in your stride.
That wouldn't harm you, would it?
Cherry?
Yes?
I was at home last night, all right?
You want me to lie?
It's a tiny little white lie.
Todd...
If you wouldn't mind.
Is there something I don't know?
Just do it.
Daddy!
Hey, baby girl, let's have a look at you.
Beautiful.
I did this myself.
My very first plait.
Let me have a look at that.
Wowee, that's fantastic.
You're amazing, do you know that?
I didn't even know you were coming.
Well, I wanted to surprise you, didn't I?
Eh?
Are those your friends over there?
Why don't you go and play with them for ten minutes and I'll just have a quick word with your mum, all right?
See you in a bit.
What are you doing?
I'm talking to my daughter.
It's not your day.
It's not my day to talk to my daughter?
See, this is what it is with you...
John, this is just how it works.
It works for you, it doesn't really work for me!
Will you calm down?
We're just outside the school gates.
I know where we are, Lisa.
All right, thank you very much.
You see her every month.
It's what we agreed.
No, it's what you decided.
I had no choice, unless I take you to court, remember?
Oh, come on!
You see her about as much as I think you can manage.
You don't even pick her up on time.
That happened once.
Twice.
In two years that's not that bad.
I try, Lisa.
I might not be perfect, like you, but I try.
Yeah, you really try.
You know how to patronise me, don't you?
We all know you're in charge, Lisa, you keep ramming it down me bloody throat!
I don't want to talk to you any more, John.
Leigh-Anne!
You can't do this.
You can't just turn up.
You're being aggressive, you're frightening me.
I'm taking Leigh-Anne into school, you can see her in a few weeks.
I just want to see her!
Morning.
Do you ever sleep, you?
Do you ever smile?
I've done blocks A to F. Course you have.
You really don't like me, do you?
No.
No, it's not that.
I just don't need you here.
I can do it, all right, that's the point.
Right, so you'll know about the staff meeting, then, starting in five minutes?
Yeah, yeah.
You all right?
You're late.
Er, yeah.
Sorry.
Right, two tickets for Kiss Me Kate was purchased under Patrick Webb's name, but only one person went and that was Patrick.
Apparently he arrived alone.
And he sold the second ticket back to the box office just before the show.
CACKLING
Was she any good?
Get Mrs Webb in.
Right.
Whoo!
Is everyone here?
I have an announcement to make.
We have lost... ..one of our most beautiful Bluebirds.
Megan Webb... has been found dead off-camp.
SHOCKED MURMURING
I'm so sorry.
It is vital that you are able to seek solace in each other, but it is also vital that we maintain a standard for our campers.
And a smile.
And you will find yourself having to answer many difficult questions, but your bright and breezy answer to them is this - it is sunshine and business as usual at the Bluebird Holiday Camp.
Now, the police, of course, are investigating, and I trust that you will be as co-operative as they require.
But I've asked them to conduct their inquiries in a manner which will not upset our campers.
This, I must emphasise, is paramount.
That is all.
Lovely speech.
MR STRETCH:
Lovely girl.
Hello.
I'm WPC Coles.
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
I've always had a thing about female police officers.
Oh, goodie for me.
I'm Detective Sergeant Bacchus.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
It's all right, Sergeant.
I've got this.
Hope so.
Name?
Manners.
Gary Manners.
Mr Manners, you worked with Megan Webb, is that correct?
You don't quite hold the same appeal as your colleague.
Answer the question, pal, all right?
I worked with her, yeah.
You worked with her...
I bet she was on your radar because you clearly have a thing with the lasses, don't you?
Aye, well, Megan clearly had a thing for the gents.
Hey, come back.
Did she have a thing for you?
That's interesting.
Maybe not.
Write this down.
Megan Webb had taste.
What did you just say?
Aye, go on.
Go on, Mr Manners, I dare you.
The thrill of chucking you in a police cell would absolutely make my day, so go on.
After you.
Right.
That's what I thought.
I'm a grown-up, you know.
I can cope.
The guy's an idiot.
Aye.
You're an idiot.
Knight in shining armour, eh?
What?
No, the guy's an idiot.
What?
Relations between staff members.
Yes.
Encouraged?
Banned?
Todd hates it.
But it goes on.
What about Megan and that Gary Manners fella?
Anything there?
I don't know.
Quick fling, maybe?
Well, when he heard about Megan, he looked as though he'd been punched in the stomach.
Well...
It's been a terrible shock for us all.
Do you know what happened between them?
Who broke it off?
No.
Sorry.
Could you confirm what your brother was doing on Saturday night?
He went home to his wife.
He left here around four and I didn't see him again until the morning.
And yourself?
I was supervising the dining hall.
We had a supervisor off sick, so I offered to step in.
I finished my shift around ten.
Rather a late night for me.
We'll need to speak to one of Megan's other cabin-mates.
Gail?
Gail, yes.
The kitchens are round the back.
I can walk you round.
Ah, we'll find our own way, thank you.
OK.
That Gary Manners fella, he's lying about something.
It's written all over his stupid, smug, shiny, stupid face.
Well, if you'd been dumped by a girl who ended up murdered, you might want to keep quiet about it.
He's as guilty as sin, man.
It's obvious.
He really kicked your perch, didn't he?
You want to tell me why you were late?
I went to see Lisa.
I went to see her at the school cos I wanted to talk to her about Leigh-Anne and my access and why I can't see her and it just all blew up.
What, you just turned up out the blue?
Yeah.
I did.
Yeah.
Clever(!
)
Yeah, all right.
All right.
Your powers of persuasion are getting better by the minute, John.
Miss Smith?
Gail, is it?
I'm DCI Gently.
This is Detective Sergeant Bacchus.
I've got to get these carrots done.
Well, we have permission to interview all staff, working, or otherwise.
I'm very sorry about what happened to your cabin-mate.
Shocking thing to happen.
Could say that.
We're searching your cabin right now.
Just so you know, OK?
Did you get on?
Three of you - you Justine and Megan - as cabin-mates?
Fine.
Three's a difficult number.
You're a bit younger than the other girls, aren't you?
What are you, 16?
In four months.
I'm 15.
Was that a problem?
In the cabin?
You know, any...ructions?
No.
Are you sure?
Anything at all?
Have you got a cigarette?
Gail...
Why did Megan dump Gary?
Don't know.
Gail, this is a murder investigation.
We ask questions and you answer, truthfully.
That's how it works.
We've got no time for messing about or telling fibs.
Well, I'm not lying, actually.
Well, you see, the word "actually" has kind of landed you in it there.
Actually.
I told you, I don't know.
What?
Three girls sharing a cabin together and you never had a good gossip about your love life?
Look, I've got to get back to work.
I've got to do this...
VOICE QUAVERING:..and then I've got to change the chip fat.
Where were you on Saturday night, Gail?
Working.
Here.
All night.
You can ask any of the kitchen staff.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
I just found this in Justine's drawer and...
Are we done?
Yep.
What is it?
I don't know.
I think it's pine disinfectant.
Might be nothing.
Let's find out when the cabins are cleaned.
Who's got a car?
Say again?
Who's got a car?
If Megan was killed in there, somebody could have kept her there and waited till it was late enough to drive her to the pier.
Well, there's a staff car and the keys are kept behind the reception desk and all staff do have access, within reason.
That'll be it.
It's my turn!
Come here.
It's my turn.
But it's mine.
He's had it all day.
The pair of yous better pack it in, right.
BOTH:
But Dad!
Sir?
The lab report's back.
It's a match.
The blood in the car was the same type as Megan's.
124 witness statements and nobody saw a thing.
Well, not yet.
Where's John?
I'm not sure.
He, um...
Well, he disappeared when he heard that there was a solicitor in the building.
I'm not sure what it's about, but...
Sorry.
Oh, great.
You don't know what you're talking about.
You're an idiot!
I'm just telling you how it is.
He's an idiot, him.
Doesn't know what he's talking about.
I take it you cornered him about Leigh-Anne.
Yeah.
And he says the only option I have is to take Lisa to court and even then, right, statistically,
I have a minuscule chance of winning.
And either way, I've got to pay the court costs.
So, not only will I end up exactly where I started... ..I'll be bankrupt.
It's great, innit, that?
Terrific.
So, what does he recommend?
He doesn't.
He told me to forget it.
So I told him to shove his clipboard up his stupid...
John.
John.
John!
John!
Not here.
Sorry.
Why don't you go and talk to Lisa again?
I can't do that.
Why not?
Because, apparently, I scare her and she doesn't want me around.
It's ridiculous.
Oh, don't mind me.
I'm only Leigh-Anne's dad.
Just the hapless father, that's all.
Where was Gary Manners on Saturday night?
Oh, look at this, man.
She keeps shifting...
John!
LOUDLY:
Where was Gary Manners on Saturday night?
Er, oh, yeah...
Him and Justine were on stage at the camp from six till last orders.
Don't they ever give them a break?
I don't think so.
They treat them like pack-horses.
Don't even have time to eat.
How did you get on with Stretch's wife?
Sir, there was no answer on the phone, so I popped round and spoke to a neighbour, who said that Mrs Stretch and his daughters had left months ago.
Did they, indeed?
Oh, yeah, and I also called the village hairdressers about Mrs Webb and asked about her wig.
Well, hairdressers know everything, especially local hair-associated facts.
Well, childbirth.
All of her hair fell out when she gave birth to Megan.
She's been wearing a wig ever since.
It's always been a problem between mother and daughter, apparently.
That's great.
Innit?
That's amazing.
Really exemplary work there, WPC Coles.
Tell us something.
Were you one of those kids that wore their school uniform at the weekends?
Would you excuse us for a moment, please, Rachel.
Bright and female.
She really rattled your cage, didn't she?
No, no, it's not that.
She's just an arrogant know-all.
She's over you like a rash.
John...
She's all like, "Oh, Mr Gently, sir..."
John, John.
I feel for you, I really do.
Not seeing Leigh-Anne, it's grossly unfair...
What would you know about it?
You're not a father.
Thanks for that.
But that does not give you permission to come here and make everybody feel as diminished as you clearly do.
You get back to the holiday camp.
You're more use there than here.
Give it a day or two, most of these campers will be gone.
You don't know that.
I admire your optimism.
Tea?
No.
Not for me.
Where's Gary Manners right about now.
He's proving to be a bit elusive.
On his way to the dancehall, I should imagine.
Whipping up our campers into a heightened state of euphoria.
Really?
How long have you been married?
16 years.
To Kitty.
Two children, if indeed that was to be your next question.
Dorothy and Heather, 14 and 12.
Do you get home much?
Well, I work hard, Sergeant.
Is that why she left?
Ah, come on, man.
That piece of information's not going to pass us by, is it?
It's a murder investigation.
Look...
I don't want anyone to know.
Even my sister doesn't know.
I had to give Kitty some money to keep quiet.
I am a family man.
Was.
Does beg the question, though, doesn't it?
What you were really doing on Saturday night?
What is this?
I've always loved Kiss Me Kate.
Perhaps you could enlighten me about Saturday night's production.
I got drunk and slept here on the sofa.
It happens a little too often.
I was embarrassed.
You were at the camp all evening?
Yes.
Did you go anywhere?
Answer the question.
In the dancehall, there's a corner of the wings where I can stand without being seen.
I make notes.
The show has to be perfect.
Efficiency is everything if we are to maintain the numbers.
Standards need to be high.
Was Megan performing?
Yes.
You lied during the murder investigation of your own daughter.
If I'd told you where I was, you would have assumed the worst!
I always assume the worst of everybody.
I didn't kill her!
You know what?
I don't believe you.
Oh, there I go again...
I didn't kill her!
How could I?
Well, you had enough of a reason.
People don't need much, surprisingly.
It was a shock...when she left, yes?
Yes.
I felt like I wanted to die, actually.
It didn't make you happy, knowing that your only daughter was following her dream?
I told you before, Inspector, I thought it was an indulgence.
She wanted lessons after school.
Ballet, tap, singing, acting.
Instead, Patrick whisked her off to his sister for extra Latin classes.
She's an exemplary Latin teacher, his sister.
No social graces though, so I keep my distance when possible.
Well, Megan must have been naturally talented then, cos she didn't have any training or crafting of her talent.
Apparently so.
What did you want to do when you were a little girl?
Er...
I liked to tell stories.
Ah.
I was good at the voices.
My mum and dad used to wheel me out at parties.
I had some... ..ambition, you might say.
But it was not to be.
You lost your hair?
SHE SIGHS
After I gave birth to Megan... ..pretty as a picture, I was not.
Would you say your daughter was as pretty as a picture?
Of course I would!
And clearly she had the talent.
She was all set to have the career that you could never have.
Yes, yes.
All right!
You went to the camp, didn't you?
SHE SIGHS
Temptation got the better of me.
I just... ..wanted to see her sing.
Saturday night?
Right, campers, we know you're desperate to see the next act, so please put your hands together for the late-night version of the After Dark Bluebirds, led by our very own Megan Webb!

Any mistakes?
There's always room for polish.
Tighter footwork.
Wider smiles.
Why did your wife leave you?
It's ironic.
One fights to maintain the perfect family holiday and in doing so, destroys one's own precious little unit.
You wouldn't understand precious if it came up and hit you in the face.
I beg your pardon?
You sit there, talking about how important family is to you, when all the time, you were having it off with Megan Webb.
No, I wasn't.
Yes, you were.
I just wouldn't!
You're lying!
Again!
This may come as a surprise to you, Sergeant, but we are not all unfaithful.
Not all of us.
My weakness is this camp.
My father's camp.
I just want it to work.
And I can't fail.
I just can't.
Do you know what?
I came to this camp a few years back.
Really?
Yep.
Me, the wife, my daughter.
We had a great time.
I remember how busy it was.
It was absolutely packed with families.
Not so packed any more.
Your camp's dying, isn't it?
Hardly that.
Come on, man, this is 1969.
Family's not what it used to be.
I should know.
People don't want to come to holiday camps any more, they want to go further afield.
Your dancehall seems busy enough.
Your dining room, all that.
You've disguised those bits very well...
No, it is not a disguise!
It is clever programming.
We lead our campers like horses to water.
One big event on the hour, every hour.
If a room is full, they'll be happy, and they will keep coming back.
You'd do anything to save this camp, wouldn't you?
Did Patrick know you went?
Megan... ..obviously wanted me to come.
I was rather touched.
She wrote more than once?
Yes.
Every week.
But I couldn't write back.
Why not?
I didn't want to engage.
She'd...disobeyed me.
But then she told me an agent was coming.
An agent?
Yes.
Someone local had seen her, told someone else.
I thought, she must be...passable, if someone's coming to see her.
Did you speak to her?
After the show.
WHOOPING AND LAUGHING
What time was this?
I suppose... ..9.20pm, 9.25pm, maybe?
Mum...
I won't come in.
What are you doing here?
I just came to see you sing a couple of songs and to say... yeah, well done.
Mum, please come in.
No, I couldn't possibly.
You came to see me.
Thought it was about time.
Got my letters, then?
Did the agent come?
You said in your letter...
Um...
I was cross with you.
Every week I write, and nothing.
I just found myself writing that, and...
I see.
No agent?
Oh, well.
That'll serve me right for not writing back.
I might not stay here, Mum.
Why?
I can't explain, really.
Mum, can I come home?
Home?
No.
No, darling, you can't.
I really should go.
Mum!
Mum...
Why'd you say no?
Because she was too good.
Oh.
She was so good, in fact, that I realised she was absolutely right, to have left home, gone to the camp.
It was a perfect platform for her.
She couldn't give it up and come home.
I wouldn't allow it.
If I didn't know you better,
I'd say you were starting to sound like a proud mum.
I don't know about that.
Oh, come on, Agnes.
"Come on" what, Mr Gently?
Do I regret not telling her that?
Absolutely that?
That I was proud of her?
Proud of her...beautiful performance?
I think so, yes.
Yes.
And regret can make a person... ..very, very angry and bitter.
Well... ..at least you went to see her.
That would have meant something to her.
You think?
Hmm.
Yeah, maybe.
But I didn't take her home with me, Inspector.
I didn't do as she asked.
We've lost our baby, Patrick.
Our baby.
SHE SOBS
CRYING:
She was such a good dancer.
I so wished you could have seen her.
I think it's what they call a cack-handed approach.
It was clumsy, certainly.
Just makes me laugh.
Does he think for one moment that him turning up like that is going to make me go, "Oh, yeah, all right, then.
"Just because you asked so nicely."
John has got a particular way with words.
That's one way of putting it.
Oh, he's always been like this, hasn't he?
Gets in a rage, because he doesn't know what else to do.
But, you know, Lisa, underneath all of that... ..he might just have...
What?
..a point.
A point?
Yeah.
Oh, no.
The amount of contact he has with Leigh-Anne is pitiful, Lisa.
It just is.
Is that what this is about?
This is why you asked us to meet?
I'll get us another drink.
MAN:
I can't explain now...
WOMAN:
I think it's best if we just get home as quick as we can...
Ah, we meet again.
I missed you.
I'll bet.
I mustn't dawdle.
Campers to entertain.
Everyone in this camp seems to think that you and Megan had a relationship except for you.
It's funny that, isn't it?
Yeah?
Well, I don't call a couple of nights in a cold, unoccupied cabin a relationship.
Maybe, you do.
How sweet(!
)
Someone even said that you were in love with her.
Who?
Oh, fascinating.
Meaning?
So many untruths whizzing about this camp, Sergeant.
Were you angry or upset when she ended it?
No.
Dear me, you're a terrible liar.
Why did she end it?
I don't know.
I don't care.
Well, you either genuinely don't know, in which case, you're thick, or you do know and you're just not telling me, in which case, you're a bit stupid.
Must be difficult in that dancehall without her.
Off you pop.
Will you think about it?
There's nothing to think about.
I disagree.
This has nothing to do with you, George.
Well, not directly, no.
But I think I know something of what John's going through.
I know what it's like to feel...
What?
Isabella died five years ago yesterday.
About this time, actually.
George, I'm sorry.
No, it's all right.
It's all right.
Well, it's not.
Lisa, I don't have a family... ..as John so kindly pointed out to me yesterday but what he doesn't know is that we did try.
For years.
We did all the tests, all of it, but...
And I think I would have made an all-right dad.
But...
Let him do it, Lisa.
George...
Something's got to give.
He could see Leigh-Anne more, couldn't he?
We've got a routine now.
This is not about routine.
This is about control.
I don't like the way you're saying that.
Why?
Why couldn't he see more of her?
Because seeing her so little, it's making his heart freeze, Lisa.
And he's her dad.
She's his little girl.
You can't change that.
You can't take that away from him.
Or her.
You look like the boss to me.
Not the other one.
Hello, there.
Just something about the way you hold yourself.
It's fun here when the sun starts to fade, isn't it?
Depends what you mean by fun.
Oh, holiday camps are all about sunshine, blue skies.
Smiling faces, colour, laughing...
It's a well-trodden path but when the night falls, we don't think about the shadows.
Let me ask you something.
Why did you lie to us when we first questioned you about Gary?
You said that Megan wasn't seeing anyone.
She wasn't, they'd split up.
Clever clogs.
What are you doing, Justine?
Well, it's my evening off.
I came out for a fag but I can't be seen loitering.
So, I'd appreciate it if miraculously you'd forgotten you'd seen us.
You and Megan were good friends, were you?
Do we have to talk about this now?
Go down the station, talk about it there if you fancy.
Well, I liked her a lot.
She knew who she was, what she was doing here.
It's an over-used term, Sergeant, but Megan was a good person.
A friend.
What about Gail?
Was she jealous at all about your friendship?
Gail's young.
I think she's used to being the underdog, but I'm... ..I'm working on her.
I used to be a bit like that... ..like Gail...
..and then I came here and everything changed.
I can't imagine you ever being like Gail.
Oh, I'd surprise you, Sergeant.
Gary and Megan were in a relationship, were they?
Yeah, everyone knows that.
Why did she dump him?
Nobody answers that question.
Why will nobody answer that question?
I don't know why she dumped him.
She was so into him.
So excited when he first showed an interest in her.
He singled her out... ..invited her to this party where it all began.
We got her ready.
I lent her a dress.
♪ Sugar
♪ Oh, honey, honey
♪ You are my candy girl
♪ And you got me wanting you
♪ Honey... ♪
That's better.
It's all about accentuation.
Isn't it a bit much?
No.
It's actually perfect.
Now, can you see what can be done?
Anything's possible...
Yeah, but I haven't even got the basics.
Oh, we can create the basics.
Trust me.
MUSIC: "Ha!
Ha!
Said The Clown" by Manfred Mann
Go and get a drink.
See what happens.
SONG CHANGES: "Build Me Up Buttercup" by The Foundations
MUSIC DROWNS HIS WHISPER
Look and learn, Gail.
Look and learn.
Well, they'd been seeing each other a couple of weeks and she suddenly went cold on him.
Did she find out he was seeing anybody else?
Anything like that?
I don't know.
I think you do.
Well, you would.
It's your job to be suspicious.
Come on, pet.
Sorry to disappoint.
Were you on stage all night on Saturday?
Yeah, between six and midnight.
Didn't leave the dancehall ever?
No.
Sure?
Absolutely.
I hate to admit it but I'm rather frightened, Sergeant.
It could happen again, couldn't it?
I'd get inside if I were you, pet.
Till we've made an arrest, this camp might not be the safest place to be.
Ta-ra.
Why did Megan want to leave that camp?
Something changed.
And something's bothering me.
The staff didn't know about Megan's murder until about ten the next morning.
Right?
Yeah, about that...
And the newspapers arrive at 11 o'clock, yeah?
Yeah, they get delivered to the cabins.
So by mid-morning, everybody knows.
Yes?
Yeah.
Right, well... there's a list of families who tried to check out of the camp before they were interviewed.
Nothing too troubling about that.
They wanted to get the hell out of there, I don't blame them.
But one family were recorded by the...
John, listen.
One family were recorded by the receptionist as desperately trying to leave at quarter past ten, Monday morning,
45 minutes before the newspapers arrived.
Yeah, and there's no radios in any of the cabins.
Sylvia and Timothy Ryan.
Cabin Red 4?
No, no, I remember now.
There was no answer when I was doing my checks.
Bring them both in - separate interviews.
Don't worry, Mr Ryan, you'll be next.
Got any children?
Yeah.
Like that, is it?
Well, life changes after kids.
Some people say for the better.
Well, it depends on your point of view.
People shouldn't have kids if they don't want them.
No-one tells you they destroy your lives.
You know what?
I hope your kids never ever hear you say that.
Oh, it's always the dads who judge the most.
And the ones who see the kids the least.
Do you know what...
Right, let's just stick to the point, shall we?
Is he staying?
Yes.
Now, where were you on Saturday night, Mrs Ryan?
I was at the camp.
Where do you think I was?
Don't get smart.
What were you doing around 9.30?
I can't remember.
Think!
Yeah, I...
I called my mum.
Tim was on his way to the dancehall,
I remember I needed to call my mum.
What about?
This and that.
Give me the number.
What?
Your mother's number.
Well, presumably she would have remembered the phone call.
So, I'll ask you again.
I went to a cabin, to meet a fella... ..a Bluebird.
Who?
His name was...
Gary.
Gary Manners?
I don't know his second name.
Gary Manners!
I'd been at the camp a week and on the second night we got chatting and we hit it off.
This was our third date, of sorts.
What time was this?
I met him around...ten.
There was a competition.
The campers got 20 minutes to dance for the judges.
Gary could come off stage - he slipped away and no-one noticed.
Go on.
Well, I met him in his cabin.
We were...
Making daisy chains.
Yeah, I know.
I get it.
When this music suddenly started, really loud - coming from a cabin nearby.
"BUILD ME UP BUTTERCUP" BLARES
What's the matter?
It's coming from Meg's cabin.
Oh, we've only got 15 minutes!
She needs to turn it down.
No, it'll be fine.
She needs to turn it down!
Meg, what are you doing?
Turn it down.
Meg, what are you playing at?
Turn it down!
VOLUME LOWERS
Thank you.
Meg?
Hello?
'How long was the music playing for?
'
Minute and a half - maybe less.
And how long were you and Gary...?
15 minutes.
Then what?
I ran back to the dance hall.
What about Gary?
Yeah, he went there too.
Just...different route.
Did you see him go?
No, but five minutes later he were on the stage.
Five minutes?
Why did you try and check out early?
Gary came to find me, when the staff had heard about the girl... the dead girl.
Well, the music we heard, Gary thought it were a bit odd.
It was too loud, out of character.
We wondered if... ..we'd witnessed something.
And you couldn't tell us because your husband would find out.
But what about Gary?
I don't know.
Because she's not Gary's usual fare, is she?
I beg your pardon.
I mean, look at her.
He could have anyone.
That's just insulting!
At least I've not got a face that looks like a horse's head caught in a clamp.
Clever.
And you'd be surprised - a lot of men like a bit of flesh.
But not Gary, eh?
I don't know what you mean.
Yes, you do.
You paid him for the sex, didn't you?
The lying git.
Megan must have found out about him.
It's not the kind of thing you want to hear about your nice new boyfriend, is it?
You're looking forward to this, aren't you?
Yeah.
Right, last six!
Three... five...
Well done.
Good, well done.
Good workout!
Star pupil!
Whoo!
Oh, God, I think I'm going to throw up.
Gary, put it away, man, will you?
I want a word with you.
I'm busy!
Now, please.
Where's the fire, gentlemen?
It's not a good look in front of the campers.
Did you sleep with Sylvia Ryan?
I need to get on, got back-to-back classes.
Well, I'll take that as a yes then.
Look, we could do this down at the station, if you like.
And there, I guarantee, you will start sweating.
It's just a bit of fun.
Do it often?
I'm a consenting adult.
Indeed you are.
But unfortunately you consented to take money for it, didn't you?
Did Megan find out and threaten to tell somebody about it?
Hey, is that why you killed her, Gary?
I wouldn't hurt Megan!
Not in a million years.
See, at the moment,
I don't believe a single word that comes out of your mouth.
First you're not seeing Megan, then you are.
You didn't leave the dancehall, then you did.
Add that to your vice activity, you're already looking at a jail term.
I didn't kill her.
Yeah, right.
I didn't kill her!
You're a smarmy git, you are, Gary.
You want to watch yourself, all roads seem to be leading to you.
Because I had some assignations, I'm capable of murder?
How many times do I need to say it?
You want to back off, man, all right?
You've got this very wrong.
You were very fond of Megan, weren't you?
Yeah, I know.
OK.
Did she find out that you were accepting money for sex?
Yes.
Who else knew?
Who else knew?
No-one.
You're lying.
I'm not.
See, I'm better at this than you are, Gary.
Now, there is something.
Isn't there?
There's something around the notion of who else knew.
Because why would you lie?
Who are you protecting?
You weren't the only one.
Were you, Gary?
Thanks, Gary.
I'm lost.
Stretch is running a knocking shop, John, right here in the camp.
Are you quite serious?
This is a family holiday camp, Inspector, it slightly misses the point.
I suggest you wipe that grin off your face and take a seat, Mr Stretch.
Gary Manners regularly slept with female campers for money.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Well, I think you do, Mr Stretch.
Was Megan a part of this?
What?
Was she one of your girls?
Cherry, Inspector Gently is under the misguided and quite frankly ludicrous impression that this camp is gaining from immoral earnings.
Would you kindly tell him that we know nothing of any prostitution.
Who told you that?
Gary Manners gave himself away.
Gary likes the sound of his own voice.
Bit of a boaster.
So you knew nothing about this?
Nothing at all?
Because Gary says he wasn't the only one.
I had to do something.
There were these loan sharks and they needed cash fast.
What are you saying?
Todd knew nothing about this.
What have you done?
The camp was failing, Todd.
We would have failed.
What have you done?
!
The camp was going under, Todd - the whole thing!
Families weren't coming any more.
We were that close.
I had to keep it afloat!
No, Cherry...not like this.
This is all we have.
This is all we are!
You're so naive, Todd.
It's business, just business.
I know it's hard, but we needed the cash.
We'd be dead otherwise.
Sit down, Mr Stretch.
How did you...market this business?
We watched, at meal-times, the couples who were struggling.
The men who looked straight past their own wives, so they could get a good look at someone else's.
Oh, it's everywhere, Inspector - unhappy couples.
Especially on holiday... all that flesh, every flaw exposed.
And what about Megan?
What about her?
Come on, Cherry, there's more.
What about Megan?
I invited her to join us.
Well, I didn't, Gary did.
We'd set the whole thing up.
I thought if she fell in love with Gary, she'd be more pliable.
Did Megan refuse to get involved?
We'd never been turned down before, we selected carefully.
She put a value on herself and it was beyond money.
And did she threaten to blow the whistle?
Yes.
Did you kill her?
No.
I was at my wit's end, yes, needed her to shut up.
We all needed her to shut up and then... ..you came and she was dead.
You say you selected carefully.
How?
They had to be... ..um...pretty... ambitious... girls and boys.
They had to be 16 and over, I was very strict about that.
16 or over?
Gail?
Justine, would you mind for a minute?
Whose is this?
It's mine.
Why was it in Justine's drawer?
Don't look at her.
She said I didn't need it any more.
Why?
Gail...
Justine, shut it.
Because I'm a grown-up now.
In what way?
Gail, a girl has died...
Megan has died.
Now, we know that some of the Bluebirds were involved with men and women who paid them for sex.
She wasn't part of it.
Yeah, I was.
Cherry didn't know, Cherry thought I were too young.
But Justine thought I were ready.
Justine, did you set Gail up with clients?
Did Megan find out?
She's 15!
She's a child!
Megan cared about that, didn't she?
There's one thing finding out her mates were sleeping with campers.
But this was too much, wasn't it?
Gail dropped the money.
She shouldn't have dropped the money!
MUSIC: "Sugar, Sugar" by The Archies
Meg, I thought you were in the staff room.
I'm not going.
Why?
What are you two doing back?
Sneaked out.
Gail fancies the new kitchen porter.
Don't you, Gail?
I said I'd redo her hair for the late shift.
Right, you, hairbrush.
Sit.
They're only on that dance floor for 16 minutes.
Then I'll be right back on that stage.
I'm sure she can do her own hair.
Only Justine can do it for me.
Is it yours?
No.
I'm asking Gail.
Gail?
No.
She's started?
Is that what you're doing, now?
You're getting her ready for a punter?
You should go back to work.
What about you?
Just go, now.
"BUILD ME UP BUTTERCUP" COMES ON
She wanted to get started.
She's just a kid.
I'm helping her out!
Really?
You really think that?
Meg, don't be angry.
I'm helping her feel beautiful.
You actually enjoy it, don't you?
What?
You actually enjoy dressing up a 15-year-old girl as your doll and sending her off to have sex with oily, bloated campers.
I turned her into something, I did that.
She was nothing.
Wow.
You're a star-maker...
You really need to be quiet.
..making dreams come true(!
)
Except this isn't Hollywood Boulevard, it's a holiday camp.
SHE TURNS THE MUSIC UP You need to shut your mouth.
Gail is too young!
I'm calling the police, you whore!
No, you're...
KNOCK AT THE DOOR Meg, what are you doing?
Turn it down.
Meg, what are you playing at?
Turn it down!
Thank you.
'Why didn't you just report Megan's death as an accident?
'
Meg?
'And take the chance 'the police would come and find out about the other stuff?
'
'And then?
'
I stood there in the dark.
The door went again and I thought it was Gary.
But it was me.
I was worried about Justine.
You came out twice?
We've got statements.
People said you were in the kitchen all night.
I'm the girl nobody notices.
I slipped away just fine.
Hello?
DISTANT KNOCKING
Justine... ..where's Meg?
Don't switch the light on.
What's going on?
Something happened and there was an accident.
Megan was going to call the police.
So I just...
She fell.
What do you mean?
She's dead.
What?
SHE WHIMPERS
No, you need to be quiet.
You need to be very, very quiet.
Everything that happens in the next five minutes is really, really important.
And you need to do everything I say, right?
Everything.
We need to get back to work.
So...help me push her under the bed and we can...we can deal with her later.
What?
Right?
Come on, under the bed.
No, don't get any blood on you!
Don't.
Gail, get back to work.
Hurry.
Well, Justine killed Megan.
That wasn't your problem.
I had to help.
What, you have to do everything she says?
Sleep with men when she says?
Move bodies when she says?
I don't know...
You're upsetting her.
You made her an accessory to murder!
And after Gail helped, you went back to the dancehall.
Yeah?
Yes.
Well, somebody must have noticed you were late.
We looked after each other.
Where have you been?
Last-minute appointment.
You're all right.
Didn't know you had one.
Spontaneity's my middle name.
The old boys love it.
That's why I'm earning more money than you.
Well, what about the delicious Sylvia Ryan?
Aye.
Except Megan was playing her music full blast.
It was distracting.
Right.
I need to talk to her.
Yeah, you should.
But I... ..I think she's getting an early night.
Maybe you should try her tomorrow.
Right, ladies and gentlemen, that is your 20 minutes' dance time up.
So I hope you had a good time down there because I certainly enjoyed watching you all.
'What about the body?
'
'We waited till three o'clock in the morning.'
For Cherry, it was all about business.
This one...
this one was something different.
I think she saw herself as some kind of Svengali.
I wonder what Stretch'll do now.
Camp's a goner, isn't it?
30 years of family holidays, how ironic.
Oh, speaking of joyous family life,
Lisa called, left a message.
What?
Yeah.
What did she want?
She's dropping off Leigh-Anne in about half an hour.
No, I'm not seeing her for three week.
I don't know, something about a new deal.
Every other weekend, I think she said.
You're joking?
I'm not.
You're joking!
No, I'm not.
Why...why's she changed her mind?
I don't know, John.
I've got to go.
Night, John.
Here's my girl!
Give us a hug!
Oh!
Thanks for that, it means everything.
Have a nice evening.
Previously on "The Originals"...
I presume i have the misfortune of speaking to my mother.
I have come to heal our family.
I'd prefer you both to join me against our mother,
But i'll happily settle for one or the other.
It is time you bring camille in.
Esther prepared your body
For someone to jump into.
She was preparing you for rebekah.
I have the baby, and we're on the run.
Esther found us.
Then she made an offer to make us all mortal again.
We mustn't let the world ever hurt her.
You're right.
Those daggers don't work on klaus.
It's not impossible to change
The dagger itself, so here.
That's a giant diamond.
It's a paragon diamond.
Use them to conduct power.
Klaus, there's something i need to tell you.
You can tell me on the way.
Where are we going?
To see our daughter.
All right, darling.
You know what to look for.
You sly old bat.
Clean up.
Meet me in the cemetery.
This little beauty and i have a date with a dagger.
You're looking very dapper this evening, kol.
Though gloves without a tailcoat.
Unusual, wouldn't you say, klaus?
I would unless of course the gloves
Are utilitarian in nature.
I didn't realize you two lovebirds
Were interested in fashion.
Oh, i can take it or leave it.
Mayor behrman on the other hand,
Now his style is impeccable,
Especially under present duress.
Do you know he came to me very concerned
About the rash of thefts in the city?
So i put marcel on it.
And after a little digging, i formed a theory
As to the culprit, so we followed our suspect.
And he led us here to the mansion
Of the recently deceased dowager fauline.
She was famous for her collection
Of rare and priceless jewels,
Most notably of course
The perfect paragon diamond.
Hand it over, kol.
- Kol!
- Get us out of here!
Oh, i wouldn't bother waiting for them.
You see, those women are never
Leaving that house again.
Merry christmas, brother.
Well, isn't this place rather nice?
Nik must have compelled a wine lover
To keep it up because i found a 2005 bordeaux.
Fancy a sip?
I appreciate the sentiment, rebekah,
But i do recognize when i'm being
Handled with kid gloves.
How are you feeling?
Patronized.
I am here to protect you.
I know you mean to, elijah.
And yet you found it necessary to render me unconscious
Before bringing me here.
Well, you weren't yourself,
And i needed to get us out of that diner.
What happened back there?
I don't know.
Niklaus sent me to protect hope.
My job is to keep her safe.
Pwoteje sa.
Scandalum subsisto venenatis.
Impedit I'ecoulement.
It's finished, but i'm worried it's not enough
To protect cami's body from esther's magic.
I might know a way to distract you
From your troubled mind.
You can take this seriously,
Or i can lock you in a coffin like
Your brother finn if you prefer.
Oh.
No.
I'd prefer you to bugger off
Because this spell needs time to cook in peace.
Cami doesn't have time.
Esther can jump anybody into her body right now.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but she's not gonna jump anybody, is she?
She's gonna jump rebekah,
Who just happens to be miles away,
But fair dues, marcel.
Think i'd be a bit testy, too,
If my old ex was about to jump into my new ex.
I think that would be a big, uh...
Awkward?
I was gonna say kinky, but...
I appreciate the chivalry, marcel,
But he'll have an easier time protecting me
If he's alive.
Keep working.
What is it with you two?
It gets a bit old, being odd man out
In me own family.
You know, klaus, elijah, rebekah,
They were always a party of 3.
No room for me at the table.
There always seemed to be room for marcel.
You know that diamond, the one that i showed you?
Mm-hmm.
Well, that was the baby version.
The one that we need to do the dagger spell,
Well it has to be a lot bigger.
100 years ago, i had it in my hand.
Then marcel ratted me out to klaus,
And they took it.
He probably bloody well kept it.
So let's steal it back.
It's a good chance to snoop.
It's like you're in my mind, davina claire.
You're making a mess of my werewolf sentries, mikael.
And you're up to your old tricks.
Esther...
I missed you, wife.
Have you missed me?
As much as you've missed me, i imagine.
That would explain why you brought your lover back
From the other side without so much as a thought of me.
I will slaughter every single wolf i see
Until i am taken to the dog
You saw fit to bring back from the dead.
You can stop looking for ansel.
Klaus killed him.
Klaus may not be your blood,
Be he certainly has picked up a few things
From you along the way.
Do not mention the bastard son!
Resolution through violence.
You are nothing if not consistent.
Go ahead.
Strike me.
I imagine you've been
Waiting a thousand years to do so.
Hyah!
Apparaitre apparebis.
Now that you've got that out your system,
We have things to discuss
About our children.
It's all right, elijah.
She won't break.
Everything you did was in the name of protecting her.
I'm not worried.
Is that what i think it is?
It's bonfire season, and i am reviving a family tradition,
Especially since we're all going to be together.
Only because we're fleeing from one of our deranged parents,
Another mikaelson family tradition.
It's a peculiar thing
Never to be tired yet forever exhausted
With the sameness of things.
Why is our family always at war?
I don't know, but being away with her
Made me see things differently.
We're not so bad.
Not the monsters that our parents think we are.
Hi.
Curse on the first born?
What the bloody hell is that supposed to be?
Well, according to finn, our sister freya
Didn't die of plague.
She was taken as payment by our aunt dahlia,
Who then cursed all mikaelson first borns
For eternity.
Is any of this true?
It is if we're to believe finn,
Who learned it from that bastion of truth, our mother.
Well, no wonder finn hates us.
He lost the sister he adored and instead
Got a judgy pack of siblings,
Who found him unbearably dull.
Great.
So is there any chance of us
Running into your loony aunt dahlia anytime soon?
Fable's over a thousand years old.
Dahlia's long dead.
Like esther?
No one's going to hurt hope
Because no one's going to find her.
It's enough wood, rebekah.
You'll burn down the whole bloody state of arkansas.
Well, we're just missing a key ingredient.
No, we're not.
Yes, we are, nik.
Back me up, elijah.
I suspect niklaus would rather choke on the ashes.
What are you all talking about?
Well, before we light it, we write down
Our wishes for each other to burn for luck.
It was kol's favorite part when were kids.
Further evidence as to why we should ignore it.
Hope's first bonfire season.
I like it.
We're doing it.
You ditched me.
You have my fake therapist locked in that coffin.
What better way to spend my potential final hours.
Try not to think about it.
I can't help it, marcel.
At any moment, i could cease to exist,
And the one person who can make a difference
Is 10 feet away and locked in a box.
I need to talk to him.
You're not talking to finn.
Maybe he'll listen, maybe he'll call his mom off.
It's a million to one, but it's better than doing nothing.
I said no, cami.
Marcel, i am hours away from someone taking control of my body.
I highly suggest you avoid trying to control me
Between now and then.
Here.
I'm holding a small child, hayley.
This silly wish game will have to wait.
You write, i'll hold.
You do realize it is not i who is to be the husband
You can boss around.
You do realize i had to endure horrendous labor
And actual death birthing the child that you're holding.
Fine.
I wish you would tell elijah
You're marrying your werewolf suitor,
At which point i will pour him a scotch
And congratulate him on the bullet he dodged.
I'm only doing this because it means so much to you,
But if it's not safe, i'm staying,
Not to control you, to protect you.
He won't talk to me if you're here, marcel,
And he's in no shape to pick a fight.
I'll be outside.
I'm not much of a cook,
But i do make a mean grilled cheese.
You're a compassionate woman camille.
It's your fatal flaw,
And it will be your downfall.
Well, that got dark fast.
Come on.
Eat.
You must be starving.
I will not be tempted by your beauty,
Nor will i be blinded by your empathy.
You don't leave a girl much wiggle room.
I would appeal to your morals,
But those seem to be all over the map.
I'm not the one who was sleeping with one vampire
While half in love with another.
Your morality is a moving target.
Mine is not.
You believe people can change.
You're still seeking out klaus' redemption
As if that were a thing that was even possible.
Elijah seeks it out.
Even my own mother seeks it out,
But i do not believe in redemption.
I believe in right and wrong.
I believe in good and evil.
Maybe in some comic book universe...
You don't even see it, but i'm trying to help
People like you.
I don't believe you.
That is to your peril because when i'm free
I will not stop until every single vampire
In new orleans has ceased to exist,
And i will show no mercy to anyone
Who dares stand with them.
Not even you.
Lock him back up.
Hyah!
Elijah.
Thank you.
What is it you see when you go away like that?
Things i've done,
Images of who i was.
Another gift from mother.
I can't turn it off.
I suppose it's her way of demonstrating
I'd be better off taking her deal.
To leave your body behind?
To start over,
To live a mortal life,
Have a child of my own if i choose.
Cursed as your first born
If we're to believe the story.
Not if i am no longer mikaelson blood.
See, this is the beauty of mother, rebekah.
Sometimes, even her darkest deeds
Possess a logic that's difficult to refute.
It's a lovely fantasy, elijah.
Rebekah, you and i both know what mother is capable of.
Now i do wonder if she would relent and leave us be.
Now what if all that mother needs is a victory.
Let her find it somewhere else.
Besides, she wants all 3 of us.
She has kol, she has finn.
Perhaps in the end, a simple majority will do.
Is this you?
I was lot better looking back then.
You wish.
What about rebekah?
You never talk about her.
There's not much to say really.
She was always their girl.
There was one time, though, she did me a solid
Back in christmas 1914.
Doing a bit of pilfering before cocktails?
Nik stole something that belongs to me.
I'm simply taking it back.
And i'm simply going to tell nik.
Wait!
What if i said i'm close to finishing a dagger
That would work on him?
You wouldn't dare use it.
Why?
It's no more than he's done to us.
You've suffered at his hands more than anyone,
And it's not like we'd be killing him,
Just giving you some time to be with marcel.
You're entirely serious.
Haven't we both earned the right
To live out of his shadow?
Are you with me, sister?
You can count me in, but do hurry downstairs.
Throw on one of nik's jackets.
He'll notice your absence if you're late.
Hey!
Look what i found.
Wonder if it will work.
Oh, bloody hell.
Come on.
Let's try.
Hey, nik.
Do you think you can cram us into a selfie?
Well, niklaus is the virtuoso
Of cramming his siblings
Into confined spaces.
I'm so glad i traveled hundreds of miles
To visit my mentally ill brother,
Only to have him insult me to my face.
Oh, come on.
Just take the picture.
Hmm.
Aw.
See?
I wish that it could always be like this.
If wishes were horses.
Beggars would ride.
You realize we'll have to burn it.
You want me to make a wish
For the family, rebekah, i wish it didn't
Have to be like this, but it does.
We can't risk it falling into the wrong hands.
No.
This... this isn't right.
We deserve this.
We've earned this.
I won't let it slip away.
I know what to do to stop esther.
Rebekah, no.
I'm gonna take her deal,
And when i do,
I'm taking her down with me.
It'll work.
She will be distracted during the spell.
She'll be vulnerable.
No.
If we kill her, she body jumps.
Then stop her from jumping.
If i knew how to bloody stop her from jumping,
Don't you think i would have happily murdered her ages ago?
Well, ages ago, you didn't have
A harvest girl or a mikaelson witch.
Kol knows all of her tricks.
Are you both insane?
Hardly, elijah.
It was your idea.
You were the one who said she needed a win,
And if we get this right, then she'll have one.
And if we do it wrong, you're no longer
In your own body.
Would that be the worst thing?
You were ready to do it yourself.
It was a foolish moment
And one that you sagely dissuaded me from.
Hopefully, we'll get lucky
And stop the spell before i jump.
And if we're not, you get what you always wanted.
I mean, that's what you're saying, isn't it?
You're willing to lose.
I'm willing to risk losing, yes.
Well, we need to find someone for her to jump into,
Someone anonymous, someone who could disappear with hope.
Rebekah, we've been together for centuries.
If you were human...
When i'm old and wrinkly,
You can dump me back into my old body.
Nik already has a coffin he can stall me in.
But to trust kol?
It's not about trust, elijah.
It's about finding the proper leverage.
She's right.
Kol will do what's best for koi.
We just have to meet his price.
Be happy to help.
In exchange for what?
From all the sneaking around today,
You're clearly in need of something.
If you want me to find a new body for rebekah,
I want the fauline diamond you stole from me back in 1914.
What do you plan to do with it?
Does it matter?
Well, it will matter to klaus.
You see, i could fib here,
But i want to be on the up about it.
I need a weapon i can use to protect myself against klaus,
And the diamond helps me make it.
It's not kill him.
Simply a matter of self-defense
Only to be used out of absolute necessity.
It's a fair trade, marcel.
I get free of the whackadoodle mum,
I acquire the means by which to defend myself
Against a volatile brother,
Should the need arise, and, uh, well,
If all goes well, perhaps you'll let me near davina
Without bodily harm.
So should i call him back, or should you?
You are made to give kol that diamond.
Our little brother has been plotting against me for years,
And he hasn't got a lick of it right.
I'll take my chances.
Do you know what to do?
Yes, but if it doesn't go to plan,
Will you handle my body with care, please?
I may miss the old model.
If everything goes south,
I'll be there to pull you out.
We just have to take esther down before she body jumps.
I don't want all of this to have been for nothing.
You and i on the same team.
It must be christmas.
She's asleep.
It's so quiet with klaus and rebekah gone.
So we didn't get to say our wishes.
Can i tell you mine?
It's a hope actually
That you'll understand what i have to tell you.
What is it?
My wolves...
i think i figured out
A way to release them from the witches.
They could control their turning without the rings
And bring peace to our home
So that hope could return to us...
But there's a catch.
I have to marry jackson.
It's, uh, a mystical ceremony
And an alpha bonding ritual.
Elijah, i know that you and i haven't been close recently,
But...
You have to know that this isn't about him.
I don't love jackson,
But at the same time, i couldn't marry him
And still be involved with you.
I don't know.
I should just...
Marry him.
What?
Listen to me.
The only way that the city will be safe for hope's return
Is if you have unified your people
And i have unified my own,
And davina will eventually lead her witches,
And whatever their goal may be,
She is no enemy to your child.
Do what you need
To bring your daughter home.
This is my wish for you.
Done!
A per request.
Miss angelica barker.
Good cheek bones and a tummy
You can bounce a quarter off.
She will be rebekah's new host body instead of cami.
Who's angelica barker?
One of my vampire potentials.
Had to turn her down.
She was too lost.
Does she know what's about to happen to her?
It's better when they don't know, luv.
Hopefully, we won't have to use her.
Hopefully, but then my mother
Is a wily and vindictive woman,
Which is why i've got to ask something else of you.
You're already getting the diamond.
Which i'm thrilled about,
But in order for me to help you,
I need access to my mother's hourglass,
Which is in the lycee with my mother.
So?
Well, i haven't been back in a while,
And the only way she won't suspect me is if i bring back
The thing that i was sent to find.
And that thing is?
The white oak stake.
Are you out of your mind?
Kaleb!
Look.
It's the only way that she's gonna trust me.
She doesn't want to kill them.
She just wants to make sure that the weapon
Doesn't fall in the wrong hands.
I swear as soon as she's gone,
I'll give it right back to klaus.
Like hell you will.
Deal's off.
Kol!
Whatever grudges you hold against me,
We are doing this for the good of our family.
Do i have your word that for once you will honor that?
You have my word, nik.
Swear on the fate of us all.
Take the stake.
I wooed her, i won her.
Took a while, but in the end,
She handed it to me.
When i didn't hear from you,
I thought you might be in trouble.
Nope.
No trouble.
Just hard to do espionage
When you're calling mummy all the time.
So where's finn.
Is he off playing emperor
To his merry pack of dogs?
I'm afraid finn may have fallen
Into the hands of your brothers,
But i've made a plan to assist him with that dilemma
While i continue my search for rebekah.
Oh.
Speak of the devil, and the devil will come.
Hello, sister.
Kol, it really is you.
I would know that smirk anywhere.
Hello, mother.
I believe you're offering a deal.
Kaleb will link this hourglass to esther's.
Ours will mirror hers.
When last sand falls,
Esther will try to jump her into you.
That's when i'll redirect the spell from you to esther.
It's meant to jam the signal just long enough
To keep that kind of magic from
Working against anyone.
If it works.
It will work.
When rebekah attacks,
Esther won't be able to jump her into you
Or herself anywhere else.
And we're sure kaleb is on board?
He's on board.
He's a thief and a liar,
But like elijah, he doesn't give his word lightly.
You can't possibly expect me to discuss
Giving up eternal life over tea.
Give me some of that red over there.
Pfft.
Well, where's the sales pitch?
I only offer what you already want.
And how do you presume to know that?
Elijah is happiest when there is order and music,
Klaus when he's the center of attention
And in control,
But you are my only child
Capable of unfettered joy,
And you're happiest amongst humans.
I've seen you year for that life, for love.
And when am i happiest then, mother?
When you're doing as you're told.
Our wishes are aligned in this, my daughter,
Mine to free you from this curse
And yours to be human.
I'd be giving up everything i've ever known
For a memory of something i once was,
Power for weakness, strength for frailty,
Eternal life for a brief human existence.
The choice is simple.
Another thousand years of never having what you want
Or a handful of years when you do.
Well, then.
To the end of an era.
I'm in.
Let us begin.
It's working.
What the bloody hell is that doing here?
As each of you comes to your senses
And takes my offer,
I will destroy your vampire bodies.
Mother, you said you wanted the stake to protect them.
Yes, but not in their current bodies.
Once they accept my offer,
I will be righting two wrongs...
No.
Having brought this evil into the world
And having subjected my own children to it.
No.
That wasn't the deal.
Stop the spell!
The spell is already done.
I prepared it to be locked in
The moment i turned over the hourglass.
Now.
Not yet.
Mother, think this through.
You gave birth to this body.
You can't destroy it.
I am only destroying its flesh.
Your beautiful soul will live on
In the body of another.
I have chosen well for you,
A beautiful girl, strong.
Mother!
Stop the spell.
You and your traitorous son.
Nik, i didn't know anything about it, i swear.
Oh, good.
I'm glad you two boys are friends again.
I did wonder what you'd been up to in your time away.
Now i know.
Stop the blasted spell.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Anything is possible.
- Take me instead.
- Nik, no!
If only you'd taken my offer when it was still mine to give.
Unfortunately, you've left me no choice
But to make a deal with mikael.
Mikael?
When finn and kol went missing,
I needed a new ally.
All he wanted was the right to kill you.
Kol, i would ask you to deliver the stake to your father,
But it seems your loyalties have been compromised.
Stop the spell, esther!
No.
It's ok, nik.
I can do this.
So you're feeling murderous again.
You should know i've already chosen my next body.
Now!
Cami!
Rebekah!
Did it work?
I have no idea.
Cami's not awake yet either.
When she's up, we need to get her out of the quarter.
She's not safe here.
Somebody busted finn out.
My mother is using mikael to do her dirty work.
Camille?
I suddenly love that stupid name.
I couldn't stop the spell.
Please tell me that your mother's dead.
Rebekah and i took extra precautions.
Esther is exactly where she needs to be.
Why are you in such a good mood?
Remember how i said that rebekah had done me a solid back in 1914?
Swore she hadn't told klaus that i was taking the diamond back.
I was actually being a bit facetious.
You're here with my brother.
A word of advice.
A witch as lovely as you has no business dating kol.
Oh, it's not really a date.
You can do better.
As you know, when the mikaelsons arrived
In louisiana we brought with us the tradition
Of holiday bonfire season.
Now we invite you chosen few
To join us in our family's own tradition
Of writing wishes for each other
And burning them for lucky.
The holidays are time for celebrating family
And friends.
It is especially gratifying in times
When treachery runs deep
To know you have someone you can trust.
A toast to you, my sister.
To rebekah!
To rebekah!
Ladies and gentlemen, i apologize for the disturbance,
But what's a mikaelson family party
Without a little squabble?
No, no!
Ohh!
I've owed her one for a century.
Today, i got to repay that favor.
Oh, don't worry, luv.
Not gonna hurt me own sister.
I didn't exactly prep angelica barker either.
I prepped someone else.
What?
Who?
Oh, it's a bit of a story.
You see, klaus didn't just punish me
For stealing the diamond.
He also punished my witch friends,
Locking them in the dowager fauline cottage.
Over the decades, it's become quite a catch-all
For an assortment of odd birds
Of the witchy variety.
I'm sure rebekah will be very comfortable
In the prison created by klaus.
You didn't.
Oh, i did, and besides,
With rebekah missing, klaus will be occupied,
So we can finish what we started.
You swear she's safe?
Perfectly.
Seeing as this is the best day i've had
In the past two centuries,
I've made a wish for you.
Close your eyes.
Hello, mother.
What have you done?
You sold me to that butcher mikael
Like i were nothing more than chattel.
Ask me what i have done.
I've done what every good son does, mother.
I've followed the example of my parents.
You taught me exactly how i should treat you.
You must be feeling a little twitchy right about now.
That's what happens when you're in transition.
No.
That's not possible.
Oh, but it is.
You see, you may have thought you were one step ahead of us,
But the truth is rebekah was two ahead of you.
And when am i happiest then, mother?
When you're doing as you're told.
The wine.
You died with vampire blood in your system.
It's a delicious irony because as you know
You cannot be both witch and vampire.
So now you either be the thing you hate the most,
Or you can be dead.
Your choice...
Which is more than you ever gave us.
Promise is a promise.
Let me out!
Someone!
Kol.
Damn it!
I'm not meant to be here.
I'm rebekah mikaelson!
I'm rebekah mikaelson!
I'm rebekah mikaelson!
Previously on "The Originals"...
I presume I have the misfortune of speaking to my mother.
I have come to heal our family.
I'd prefer you both to join me against our mother, but I'll happily settle for one or the other.
It is time you bring Camille in.
Esther prepared your body for someone to jump into.
She was preparing you for Rebekah.
I have the baby, and we're on the run.
Esther found us.
Then she made an offer to make us all mortal again.
We mustn't let the world ever hurt her.
You're right.
Those daggers don't work on Klaus.
It's not impossible to change the dagger itself, so here.
That's a giant diamond.
It's a paragon diamond.
Use them to conduct power.
Klaus, there's something I need to tell you.
- You can tell me on the way.
- Where are we going?
To see our daughter.
All right, darling.
You know what to look for.
You sly old bat.
Clean up.
Meet me in the cemetery.
This little beauty and I have a date with a dagger.
You're looking very dapper this evening, Kol.
Though gloves without a tailcoat.
Unusual, wouldn't you say, Klaus?
I would unless of course the gloves are utilitarian in nature.
I didn't realize you two lovebirds were interested in fashion.
Oh, I can take it or leave it.
Mayor Behrman on the other hand, now his style is impeccable, especially under present duress.
Do you know he came to me very concerned about the rash of thefts in the city?
So I put Marcel on it.
And after a little digging, I formed a theory as to the culprit, so we followed our suspect.
And he led us here to the mansion of the recently deceased dowager fauline.
She was famous for her collection of rare and priceless jewels, most notably of course the perfect paragon diamond.
Hand it over, Kol.
- Kol!
- Get us out of here!
Oh, I wouldn't bother waiting for them.
You see, those women are never leaving that house again.
Merry Christmas, brother.
Well, isn't this place rather nice?
Nik must have compelled a wine lover to keep it up because I found a 2005 bordeaux.
Fancy a sip?
I appreciate the sentiment, Rebekah, but I do recognize when I'm being handled with kid gloves.
How are you feeling?
Patronized.
I am here to protect you.
I know you mean to, Elijah.
And yet you found it necessary to render me unconscious before bringing me here.
Well, you weren't yourself, and I needed to get us out of that diner.
What happened back there?
I don't know.
Niklaus sent me to protect hope.
My job is to keep her safe.
Pwoteje sa.
Scandalum subsisto venenatis.
Impedit I'ecoulement.
It's finished, but I'm worried it's not enough to protect Cami's body from Esther's magic.
I might know a way to distract you from your troubled mind.
You can take this seriously, or I can lock you in a coffin like your brother Finn if you prefer.
Oh.
No.
I'd prefer you to bugger off because this spell needs time to cook in peace.
Cami doesn't have time.
Esther can jump anybody into her body right now.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but she's not gonna jump anybody, is she?
She's gonna jump Rebekah, who just happens to be miles away, but fair dues, Marcel.
Think I'd be a bit testy, too, if my old ex was about to jump into my new ex.
I think that would be a big, uh...
Awkward?
I was gonna say kinky, but...
I appreciate the chivalry, Marcel, but he'll have an easier time protecting me if he's alive.
Keep working.
What is it with you two?
It gets a bit old, plan out in me own family.
You know, Klaus, Elijah, Rebekah, they were always a party of 3.
No room for me at the table.
There always seemed to be room for Marcel.
You know that diamond, the one that I showed you?
Mm-hmm.
Well, that was the baby version.
The one that we need to do the dagger spell, well it has to be a lot bigger.
100 years ago, I had it in my hand.
Then Marcel ratted me out to Klaus, and they took it.
He probably bloody well kept it.
So let's steal it back.
It's a good chance to snoop.
It's like you're in my mind, Davina Claire.
You're making a mess of my werewolf sentries, Mikael.
And you're up to your old tricks.
Esther...
I missed you, wife.
Have you missed me?
As much as you've missed me, I imagine.
That would explain why you brought your lover back from the other side without so much as a thought of me.
I will slaughter every single wolf I see until I am taken to the dog you saw fit to bring back from the dead.
You can stop looking for ansel.
Klaus killed him.
Klaus may not be your blood, be he certainly has picked up a few things from you along the way.
Do not mention the bastard son!
Resolution through violence.
You are nothing if not consistent.
Go ahead.
Strike me.
I imagine you've been waiting a thousand years to do so.
Hyah!
Apparaitre apparebis.
Now that you've got that out your system, we have things to discuss about our children.
It's all right, Elijah.
She won't break.
Everything you did was in the name of protecting her.
I'm not worried.
Is that what I think it is?
It's bonfire season, and I am reviving a family tradition, especially since we're all going to be together.
Only because we're fleeing from one of our deranged parents, another Mikaelson family tradition.
It's a peculiar thing never to be tired yet forever exhausted with the sameness of things.
Why is our family always at war?
I don't know, but being away with her made me see things differently.
We're not so bad.
Not the monsters that our parents think we are.
Hi.
Curse on the first born?
What the bloody hell is that supposed to be?
Well, according to Finn, our sister freya didn't die of plague.
She was taken as payment by our aunt dahlia, who then cursed all Mikaelson first borns for eternity.
Is any of this true?
It is if we're to believe Finn, who learned it from that bastion of truth, our mother.
Well, no wonder Finn hates us.
He lost the sister he adored and instead got a judgy pack of siblings, who found him unbearably dull.
Great.
So is there any chance of us running into your loony aunt dahlia anytime soon?
Fable's over a thousand years old.
Dahlia's long dead.
Like Esther?
No one's going to hurt hope because no one's going to find her.
It's enough wood, Rebekah.
You'll burn down the whole bloody state of Arkansas.
Well, we're just missing a key ingredient.
No, we're not.
Yes, we are, Nik.
Back me up, Elijah.
I suspect Niklaus would rather choke on the ashes.
What are you all talking about?
Well, before we light it, we write down our wishes for each other to burn for luck.
It was Kol's favorite part when were kids.
Further evidence as to why we should ignore it.
Hope's first bonfire season.
I like it.
We're doing it.
You ditched me.
You have my fake therapist locked in that coffin.
What better way to spend my potential final hours.
Try not to think about it.
I can't help it, Marcel.
At any moment, I could cease to exist, and the one person who can make a difference is 10 feet away and locked in a box.
I need to talk to him.
You're not talking to Finn.
Maybe he'll listen, maybe he'll call his mom off.
It's a million to one, but it's better than doing nothing.
I said no, Cami.
Marcel, I am hours away from someone taking control of my body.
I highly suggest you avoid trying to control me between now and then.
Here.
I'm holding a small child, Hayley.
This silly wish game will have to wait.
You write, I'll hold.
You do realize it is not I who is to be the husband you can boss around.
You do realize I had to endure horrendous labor and actual death birthing the child that you're holding.
Fine.
I wish you would tell Elijah you're marrying your werewolf suitor, at which point I will pour him a scotch and congratulate him on the bullet he dodged.
I'm only doing this because it means so much to you, but if it's not safe, I'm staying, not to control you, to protect you.
He won't talk to me if you're here, Marcel, and he's in no shape to pick a fight.
I'll be outside.
I'm not much of a cook, but I do make a mean grilled cheese.
You're a compassionate woman Camille.
It's your fatal flaw, and it will be your downfall.
Well, that got dark fast.
Come on.
Eat.
You must be starving.
I will not be tempted by your beauty, nor will I be blinded by your empathy.
You don't leave a girl much wiggle room.
I would appeal to your morals, but those seem to be all over the map.
I'm not the one who was sleeping with one vampire while half in love with another.
Your morality is a moving target.
Mine is not.
You believe people can change.
You're still seeking out Klaus' redemption as if that were a thing that was even possible.
Elijah seeks it out.
Even my own mother seeks it out, but I do not believe in redemption.
I believe in right and wrong.
I believe in good and evil.
Maybe in some comic book universe...
You don't even see it, but I'm trying to help people like you.
I don't believe you.
That is to your peril because when I'm free
I will not stop until every single vampire in New Orleans has ceased to exist, and I will show no mercy to anyone who dares stand with them.
Not even you.
Lock him back up.
Hyah!
Elijah.
Thank you.
What is it you see when you go away like that?
Things I've done, images of who I was.
Another gift from mother.
I can't turn it off.
I suppose it's her way of demonstrating
I'd be better off taking her deal.
To leave your body behind?
To start over, to live a mortal life, have a child of my own if I choose.
Cursed as your first born if we're to believe the story.
Not if I am no longer Mikaelson blood.
See, this is the beauty of mother, Rebekah.
Sometimes, even her darkest deeds possess a logic that's difficult to refute.
It's a lovely fantasy, elijah.
Rebekah, you and I both know what mother is capable of.
Now I do wonder if she would relent and leave us be.
Now what if all that mother needs is a victory.
Let her find it somewhere else.
Besides, she wants all 3 of us.
She has Kol, she has Finn.
Perhaps in the end, a simple majority will do.
Is this you?
I was lot better looking back then.
You wish.
What about Rebekah?
You never talk about her.
There's not much to say really.
She was always their girl.
There was one time, though, she did me a solid back in Christmas 1914.
Doing a bit of pilfering before cocktails?
Nik stole something that belongs to me.
I'm simply taking it back.
And I'm simply going to tell Nik.
Wait!
What if I said I'm close to finishing a dagger that would work on him?
You wouldn't dare use it.
Why?
It's no more than he's done to us.
You've suffered at his hands more than anyone, and it's not like we'd be killing him, just giving you some time to be with Marcel.
You're entirely serious.
Haven't we both earned the right to live out of his shadow?
Are you with me, sister?
You can count me in, but do hurry downstairs.
Throw on one of Nik's jackets.
He'll notice your absence if you're late.
Hey!
Look what I found.
Wonder if it will work.
Oh, bloody hell.
Come on.
Let's try.
Hey, Nik.
Do you think you can cram us into a selfie?
Well, Niklaus is the virtuoso of cramming his siblings into confined spaces.
I'm so glad I traveled hundreds of miles to visit my mentally ill brother, only to have him insult me to my face.
Oh, come on.
Just take the picture.
Hmm.
Aw.
See?
I wish that it could always be like this.
If wishes were horses.
Beggars would ride.
You realize we'll have to burn it.
You want me to make a wish for the family, Rebekah, I wish it didn't have to be like this, but it does.
We can't risk it falling into the wrong hands.
No.
This... this isn't right.
We deserve this.
We've earned this.
I won't let it slip away.
I know what to do to stop Esther.
Rebekah, no.
I'm gonna take her deal, and when I do,
I'm taking her down with me.
It'll work.
She will be distracted during the spell.
She'll be vulnerable.
No.
If we kill her, she body jumps.
Then stop her from jumping.
If I knew how to bloody stop her from jumping, don't you think I would have happily murdered her ages ago?
Well, ages ago, you didn't have a harvest girl or a Mikaelson witch.
Kol knows all of her tricks.
Are you both insane?
Hardly, Elijah.
It was your idea.
You were the one who said she needed a win, and if we get this right, then she'll have one.
And if we do it wrong, you're no longer in your own body.
Would that be the worst thing?
You were ready to do it yourself.
It was a foolish moment and one that you sagely dissuaded me from.
Hopefully, we'll get lucky and stop the spell before I jump.
And if we're not, you get what you always wanted.
I mean, that's what you're saying, isn't it?
You're willing to lose.
I'm willing to risk losing, yes.
Well, we need to find someone for her to jump into, someone anonymous, someone who could disappear with hope.
Rebekah, we've been together for centuries.
If you were human...
When I'm old and wrinkly, you can dump me back into my old body.
Nik already has a coffin he can stall me in.
But to trust Kol?
It's not about trust, Elijah.
It's about finding the proper leverage.
She's right.
Kol will do what's best for Kol.
We just have to meet his price.
Be happy to help.
In exchange for what?
From all the sneaking around today, you're clearly in need of something.
If you want me to find a new body for Rebekah,
I want the Fauline diamond you stole from me back in 1914.
What do you plan to do with it?
Does it matter?
Well, it will matter to Klaus.
You see, I could fib here, but I want to be on the up about it.
I need a weapon I can use to protect myself against Klaus, and the diamond helps me make it.
It's not kill him.
Simply a matter of self-defense only to be use out of absolute necessity.
It's a fair trade, Marcel.
I get free of the whackadoodle mum,
I acquire the means by which to defend myself against a volatile brother, should the need arise, and, uh, well, if all goes well, perhaps you'll let me near Davina without bodily harm.
So should I call him back, or should you?
You are made to give Kol that diamond.
Our little brother has been plotting against me for years, and he hasn't got a lick of it right.
I'll take my chances.
Do you know what to do?
Yes, but if it doesn't go to plan, will you handle my body with care, please?
I may miss the old model.
If everything goes south, I'll be there to pull you out.
We just have to take Esther down before she body jumps.
I don't want all of this to have been for nothing.
You and I on the same team.
It must be Christmas.
She's asleep.
It's so quiet with Klaus and Rebekah gone.
So we didn't get to say our wishes.
Can I tell you mine?
It's a hope actually that you'll understand what I have to tell you.
What is it?
My wolves...
I think I figured out a way to release them from the witches.
They could control their turning without the rings and bring peace to our home so that hope could return to us...
But there's a catch.
I have to marry Jackson.
It's, uh, a mystical ceremony and an alpha bonding ritual.
Elijah, I know that you and I haven't been close recently, but...
You have to know that this isn't about him.
I don't love Jackson, but at the same time, I couldn't marry him and still be involved with you.
I don't know.
I should just...
Marry him.
What?
Listen to me.
The only way that the city will be safe for hope's return is if you have unified your people and I have unified my own, and Davina will eventually lead her witches, and whatever their goal may be,
she is no enemy to your child.
Do what you need to bring your daughter home.
This is my wish for you.
Done!
A per request.
Miss angelica barker.
Good cheek bones and a tummy you can bounce a quarter off.
She will be Rebekah's new host body instead of Cami.
Who's angelica barker?
One of my vampire potentials.
Had to turn her down.
She was too lost.
Does she know what's about to happen to her?
It's better when they don't know, luv.
Hopefully, we won't have to use her.
Hopefully, but then my mother is a wily and vindictive woman, which is why I've got to ask something else of you.
You're already getting the diamond.
Which I'm thrilled about, but in order for me to help you,
I need access to my mother's hourglass, which is in the lycee with my mother.
So?
Well, I haven't been back in a while, and the only way she won't suspect me is if I bring back the thing that I was sent to find.
And that thing is?
The white oak stake.
Are you out of your mind?
Kaleb!
Look.
It's the only way that she's gonna trust me.
She doesn't want to kill them.
She just wants to make sure that the weapon doesn't fall in the wrong hands.
I swear as soon as she's gone,
I'll give it right back to Klaus.
Like hell you will.
Deal's off.
Kol!
Whatever grudges you hold against me, we are doing this for the good of our family.
Do I have your word that for once you will honor that?
You have my word, Nik.
Swear on the fate of us all.
Take the stake.
I wooed her, I won her.
Took a while, but in the end, she handed it to me.
When I didn't hear from you,
I thought you might be in trouble.
Nope.
No trouble.
Just hard to do espionage when you're calling mummy all the time.
So where's Finn.
Is he off playing emperor to his merry pack of dogs?
I'm afraid Finn may have fallen into the hands of your brothers, but I've made a plan to assist him with that dilemma while I continue my search for Rebekah.
Oh.
Speak of the devil, and the devil will come.
Hello, sister.
Kol, it really is you.
I would know that smirk anywhere.
Hello, mother.
I believe you're offering a deal.
Kaleb will link this hourglass to Esther's.
Ours will mirror hers.
When last sand falls, Esther will try to jump her into you.
That's when I'll redirect the spell from you to Esther.
It's meant to jam the signal just long enough to keep that kind of magic from working against anyone.
If it works.
It will work.
When Rebekah attacks,
Esther won't be able to jump her into you or herself anywhere else.
And we're sure Kaleb is on board?
He's on board.
He's a thief and a liar, but like Elijah, he doesn't give his word lightly.
You can't possibly expect me to discuss giving up eternal life over tea.
Give me some of that red over there.
Pfft.
Well, where's the sales pitch?
I only offer what you already want.
And how do you presume to know that?
Elijah is happiest when there is order and music,
Klaus when he's the center of attention and in control, but you are my only child capable of unfettered joy, and you're happiest amongst humans.
I've seen you year for that life, for love.
And when am I happiest then, mother?
When you're doing as you're told.
Our wishes are aligned in this, my daughter, mine to free you from this curse and yours to be human.
I'd be giving up everything I've ever known for a memory of something I once was, power for weakness, strength for frailty, eternal life for a brief human existence.
The choice is simple.
Another thousand years of never having what you want or a handful of years when you do.
Well, then.
To the end of an era.
I'm in.
Let us begin.
It's working.
What the bloody hell is that doing here?
As each of you comes to your senses and takes my offer,
I will destroy your vampire bodies.
Mother, you said you wanted the stake to protect them.
Yes, but not in their current bodies.
Once they accept my offer, I will be righting two wrongs...
No.
Having brought this evil into the world and having subjected my own children to it.
No.
That wasn't the deal.
Stop the spell!
The spell is already done.
I prepared it to be locked in the moment I turned over the hourglass.
Now.
Not yet.
Mother, think this through.
You gave birth to this body.
You can't destroy it.
I am only destroying its flesh.
Your beautiful soul will live on in the body of another.
I have chosen well for you, a beautiful girl, strong.
Mother!
Stop the spell.
You and your traitorous son.
Nik, I didn't know anything about it, I swear.
Oh, good.
I'm glad you two boys are friends again.
I did wonder what you'd been up to in your time away.
Now I know.
Stop the blasted spell.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Anything is possible.
- Take me instead.
- Nik, no!
If only you'd taken my offer when it was still mine to give.
Unfortunately, you've left me no choice but to make a deal with Mikael.
Mikael?
When Finn and Kol went missing, I needed a new ally.
All he wanted was the right to kill you.
Kol, I would ask you to deliver the stake to your father, but it seems your loyalties have been compromised.
Stop the spell, Esther!
No.
It's ok, Nik.
I can do this.
So you're feeling murderous again.
You should know I've already chosen my next body.
Now!
Cami!
Rebekah!
- Did it work?
- I have no idea.
Cami's not awake yet either.
When she's up, we need to get her out of the quarter.
She's not safe here.
Somebody busted Finn out.
My mother is using Mikael to do her dirty work.
Camille?
I suddenly love that stupid name.
I couldn't stop the spell.
Please tell me that your mother's dead.
Rebekah and I took extra precautions.
Esther is exactly where she needs to be.
Why are you in such a good mood?
Remember how I said that Rebekah had done me a solid back in 1914?
Swore she hadn't told Klaus that I was taking the diamond back.
I was actually being a bit facetious.
You're here with my brother.
A word of advice.
A witch as lovely as you has no business dating Kol.
Oh, it's not really a date.
You can do better.
As you know, when the Mikaelsons arrived in Louisiana we brought with us the tradition of holiday bonfire season.
Now we invite you chosen few to join us in our family's own tradition of writing wishes for each other and burning them for lucky.
The holidays are time for celebrating family and friends.
It is especially gratifying in times when treachery runs deep to know you have someone you can trust.
A toast to you, my sister.
To Rebekah!
To Rebekah!
Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize for the disturbance, but what's a Mikaelson family party without a little squabble?
No, no!
Ohh!
I've owed her one for a century.
Today, I got to repay that favor.
Oh, don't worry, luv.
Not gonna hurt me own sister.
I didn't exactly prep angelica barker either.
I prepped someone else.
What?
Who?
Oh, it's a bit of a story.
You see, Klaus didn't just punish me for stealing the diamond.
He also punished my witch friends, locking them in the dowager Fauline cottage.
Over the decades, it's become quite a catch-all for an assortment of odd birds of the witchy variety.
I'm sure Rebekah will be very comfortable in the prison created by Klaus.
You didn't.
Oh, I did, and besides, with Rebekah missing, Klaus will be occupied, so we can finish what we started.
You swear she's safe?
Perfectly.
Seeing as this is the best day I've had in the past two centuries, I've made a wish for you.
Close your eyes.
Hello, mother.
What have you done?
You sold me to that butcher Mikael like I were nothing more than chattel.
Ask me what I have done.
I've done what every good son does, mother.
I've followed the example of my parents.
You taught me exactly how I should treat you.
You must be feeling a little twitchy right about now.
That's what happens when you're in transition.
No.
That's not possible.
Oh, but it is.
You see, you may have thought you were one step ahead of us, but the truth is Rebekah was two ahead of you.
And when am I happiest then, mother?
When you're doing as you're told.
The wine.
You died with vampire blood in your system.
It's a delicious irony because as you know you cannot be both witch and vampire.
So now you either be the thing you hate the most, or you can be dead.
Your choice...
Which is more than you ever gave us.
Promise is a promise.
Let me out!
Someone!
Kol.
Damn it!
I'm not meant to be here.
I'm Rebekah Mikaelson!
I'm Rebekah Mikaelson!
Let me out!
I'm Rebekah Mikaelson!
Previously on "The Originals"...
I presume I have the misfortune of speaking to my mother.
I have come to heal our family.
I'd prefer you both to join me against our mother, but I'll happily settle for one or the other.
It is time you bring Camille in.
Esther prepared your body for someone to jump into.
She was preparing you for Rebekah.
I have the baby, and we're on the run.
Esther found us.
Then she made an offer to make us all mortal again.
[Gasps]
Elijah:
We mustn't let the world ever hurt her.
You're right.
Those daggers don't work on Klaus.
It's not impossible to change the dagger itself, so here.
That's a giant diamond.
It's a paragon diamond.
Use them to conduct power.
Klaus, there's something I need to tell you.
- You can tell me on the way.
- Where are we going?
To see our daughter.
[Singing Christmas carol]
All right, darling.
You know what to look for.
You sly old bat.
Clean up.
Meet me in the cemetery.
This little beauty and I have a date with a dagger.
Klaus:
You're looking very dapper this evening, Kol.
Though gloves without a tailcoat.
Unusual, wouldn't you say, Klaus?
I would unless of course the gloves are utilitarian in nature.
I didn't realize you two lovebirds were interested in fashion.
Oh, I can take it or leave it.
Mayor Behrman on the other hand, now his style is impeccable, especially under present duress.
Do you know he came to me very concerned about the rash of thefts in the city?
So I put Marcel on it.
And after a little digging, I formed a theory as to the culprit, so we followed our suspect.
And he led us here to the mansion of the recently deceased dowager fauline.
She was famous for her collection of rare and priceless jewels, most notably of course the perfect paragon diamond.
Hand it over, Kol.
[Chanting]
[Banging on doors]
- Kol!
- Get us out of here!
Oh, I wouldn't bother waiting for them.
You see, those women are never leaving that house again.
Merry Christmas, brother.
[Screaming]
Rebekah:
Well, isn't this place rather nice?
Nik must have compelled a wine lover to keep it up because I found a 2005 bordeaux.
Fancy a sip?
I appreciate the sentiment, Rebekah, but I do recognize when I'm being handled with kid gloves.
How are you feeling?
Patronized.
I am here to protect you.
I know you mean to, Elijah.
And yet you found it necessary to render me unconscious before bringing me here.
Well, you weren't yourself, and I needed to get us out of that diner.
What happened back there?
I don't know.
Niklaus sent me to protect hope.
My job is to keep her safe.
Both:
Pwoteje sa.
Scandalum subsisto venenatis.
Impedit I'ecoulement.
It's finished, but I'm worried it's not enough to protect Cami's body from Esther's magic.
I might know a way to distract you from your troubled mind.
Marcel:
You can take this seriously, or I can lock you in a coffin like your brother Finn if you prefer.
Oh.
No.
I'd prefer you to bugger off because this spell needs time to cook in peace.
Cami doesn't have time.
Esther can jump anybody into her body right now.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but she's not gonna jump anybody, is she?
She's gonna jump Rebekah, who just happens to be miles away, but fair dues, Marcel.
Think I'd be a bit testy, too, if my old ex was about to jump into my new ex.
I think that would be a big, uh...
Awkward?
I was gonna say kinky, but...
I appreciate the chivalry, Marcel, but he'll have an easier time protecting me if he's alive.
Keep working.
What is it with you two?
It gets a bit old, plan out in me own family.
You know, Klaus, Elijah, Rebekah, they were always a party of 3.
No room for me at the table.
There always seemed to be room for Marcel.
You know that diamond, the one that I showed you?
Mm-hmm.
Well, that was the baby version.
The one that we need to do the dagger spell, well it has to be a lot bigger.
100 years ago, I had it in my hand.
Then Marcel ratted me out to Klaus, and they took it.
He probably bloody well kept it.
So let's steal it back.
It's a good chance to snoop.
It's like you're in my mind, Davina Claire.
[Mikael grunting]
[Bird chirps]
You're making a mess of my werewolf sentries, Mikael.
And you're up to your old tricks.
Esther...
I missed you, wife.
Have you missed me?
As much as you've missed me, I imagine.
That would explain why you brought your lover back from the other side without so much as a thought of me.
I will slaughter every single wolf I see until I am taken to the dog you saw fit to bring back from the dead.
You can stop looking for ansel.
Klaus killed him.
Klaus may not be your blood, be he certainly has picked up a few things from you along the way.
Do not mention the bastard son!
Resolution through violence.
You are nothing if not consistent.
Go ahead.
Strike me.
I imagine you've been waiting a thousand years to do so.
Hyah!
Apparaitre apparebis.
Now that you've got that out your system, we have things to discuss about our children.
It's all right, Elijah.
She won't break.
Everything you did was in the name of protecting her.
I'm not worried.
Is that what I think it is?
It's bonfire season, and I am reviving a family tradition, especially since we're all going to be together.
Only because we're fleeing from one of our deranged parents, another Mikaelson family tradition.
It's a peculiar thing never to be tired yet forever exhausted with the sameness of things.
Why is our family always at war?
I don't know, but being away with her made me see things differently.
We're not so bad.
Not the monsters that our parents think we are.
[Car approaching]
Hi.
Curse on the first born?
What the bloody hell is that supposed to be?
Well, according to Finn, our sister freya didn't die of plague.
She was taken as payment by our aunt dahlia, who then cursed all Mikaelson first borns for eternity.
Is any of this true?
Elijah:
It is if we're to believe Finn, who learned it from that bastion of truth, our mother.
Well, no wonder Finn hates us.
He lost the sister he adored and instead got a judgy pack of siblings, who found him unbearably dull.
Great.
So is there any chance of us running into your loony aunt dahlia anytime soon?
Fable's over a thousand years old.
Dahlia's long dead.
Like Esther?
No one's going to hurt hope because no one's going to find her.
It's enough wood, Rebekah.
You'll burn down the whole bloody state of Arkansas.
Well, we're just missing a key ingredient.
No, we're not.
Yes, we are, Nik.
Back me up, Elijah.
I suspect Niklaus would rather choke on the ashes.
What are you all talking about?
Well, before we light it, we write down our wishes for each other to burn for luck.
It was Kol's favorite part when were kids.
Further evidence as to why we should ignore it.
Hope's first bonfire season.
I like it.
We're doing it.
You ditched me.
You have my fake therapist locked in that coffin.
What better way to spend my potential final hours.
Try not to think about it.
I can't help it, Marcel.
At any moment, I could cease to exist, and the one person who can make a difference is 10 feet away and locked in a box.
I need to talk to him.
You're not talking to Finn.
Maybe he'll listen, maybe he'll call his mom off.
It's a million to one, but it's better than doing nothing.
I said no, Cami.
Marcel, I am hours away from someone taking control of my body.
I highly suggest you avoid trying to control me between now and then.
[Music playing]
Here.
I'm holding a small child, Hayley.
This silly wish game will have to wait.
You write, I'll hold.
You do realize it is not I who is to be the husband you can boss around.
You do realize I had to endure horrendous labor and actual death birthing the child that you're holding.
Fine.
I wish you would tell Elijah you're marrying your werewolf suitor, at which point I will pour him a scotch and congratulate him on the bullet he dodged.
Marcel:
I'm only doing this because it means so much to you, but if it's not safe, I'm staying, not to control you, to protect you.
He won't talk to me if you're here, Marcel, and he's in no shape to pick a fight.
I'll be outside.
I'm not much of a cook, but I do make a mean grilled cheese.
You're a compassionate woman Camille.
It's your fatal flaw, and it will be your downfall.
Well, that got dark fast.
Come on.
Eat.
You must be starving.
I will not be tempted by your beauty, nor will I be blinded by your empathy.
You don't leave a girl much wiggle room.
I would appeal to your morals, but those seem to be all over the map.
I'm not the one who was sleeping with one vampire while half in love with another.
Your morality is a moving target.
Mine is not.
You believe people can change.
You're still seeking out Klaus' redemption as if that were a thing that was even possible.
Elijah seeks it out.
Even my own mother seeks it out, but I do not believe in redemption.
I believe in right and wrong.
I believe in good and evil.
Maybe in some comic book universe...
You don't even see it, but I'm trying to help people like you.
I don't believe you.
That is to your peril because when I'm free
I will not stop until every single vampire in New Orleans has ceased to exist, and I will show no mercy to anyone who dares stand with them.
Not even you.
Lock him back up.
[Sighs]
[Screaming]
Hyah!
[Exhales]
Rebekah:
Elijah.
Thank you.
What is it you see when you go away like that?
Things I've done, images of who I was.
Another gift from mother.
I can't turn it off.
I suppose it's her way of demonstrating
I'd be better off taking her deal.
To leave your body behind?
To start over, to live a mortal life, have a child of my own if I choose.
Cursed as your first born if we're to believe the story.
Not if I am no longer Mikaelson blood.
See, this is the beauty of mother, Rebekah.
Sometimes, even her darkest deeds possess a logic that's difficult to refute.
It's a lovely fantasy, elijah.
Rebekah, you and I both know what mother is capable of.
Now I do wonder if she would relent and leave us be.
Now what if all that mother needs is a victory.
Let her find it somewhere else.
Besides, she wants all 3 of us.
She has Kol, she has Finn.
Perhaps in the end, a simple majority will do.
Is this you?
I was lot better looking back then.
You wish.
What about Rebekah?
You never talk about her.
There's not much to say really.
She was always their girl.
There was one time, though, she did me a solid back in Christmas 1914.
[Music playing]
Doing a bit of pilfering before cocktails?
Nik stole something that belongs to me.
I'm simply taking it back.
And I'm simply going to tell Nik.
Wait!
What if I said I'm close to finishing a dagger that would work on him?
You wouldn't dare use it.
Why?
It's no more than he's done to us.
You've suffered at his hands more than anyone, and it's not like we'd be killing him, just giving you some time to be with Marcel.
You're entirely serious.
Haven't we both earned the right to live out of his shadow?
Are you with me, sister?
You can count me in, but do hurry downstairs.
Throw on one of Nik's jackets.
He'll notice your absence if you're late.
Hey!
Look what I found.
Wonder if it will work.
Oh, bloody hell.
Come on.
Let's try.
Hey, Nik.
Do you think you can cram us into a selfie?
Well, Niklaus is the virtuoso of cramming his siblings into confined spaces.
I'm so glad I traveled hundreds of miles to visit my mentally ill brother, only to have him insult me to my face.
Oh, come on.
Just take the picture.
Hmm.
Hayley:
Aw.
See?
I wish that it could always be like this.
If wishes were horses.
Beggars would ride.
You realize we'll have to burn it.
You want me to make a wish for the family, Rebekah, I wish it didn't have to be like this, but it does.
[Music playing]
We can't risk it falling into the wrong hands.
No.
This... this isn't right.
We deserve this.
We've earned this.
I won't let it slip away.
I know what to do to stop Esther.
Rebekah, no.
I'm gonna take her deal, and when I do,
I'm taking her down with me.
[Music playing]
Rebekah:
It'll work.
She will be distracted during the spell.
She'll be vulnerable.
No.
If we kill her, she body jumps.
Then stop her from jumping.
If I knew how to bloody stop her from jumping, don't you think I would have happily murdered her ages ago?
Well, ages ago, you didn't have a harvest girl or a Mikaelson witch.
Kol knows all of her tricks.
Are you both insane?
Hardly, Elijah.
It was your idea.
You were the one who said she needed a win, and if we get this right, then she'll have one.
And if we do it wrong, you're no longer in your own body.
Would that be the worst thing?
You were ready to do it yourself.
It was a foolish moment and one that you sagely dissuaded me from.
Hopefully, we'll get lucky and stop the spell before I jump.
And if we're not, you get what you always wanted.
I mean, that's what you're saying, isn't it?
You're willing to lose.
I'm willing to risk losing, yes.
Well, we need to find someone for her to jump into, someone anonymous, someone who could disappear with hope.
Rebekah, we've been together for centuries.
If you were human...
When I'm old and wrinkly, you can dump me back into my old body.
Nik already has a coffin he can stall me in.
But to trust Kol?
It's not about trust, Elijah.
It's about finding the proper leverage.
She's right.
Kol will do what's best for Kol.
We just have to meet his price.
Be happy to help.
In exchange for what?
From all the sneaking around today, you're clearly in need of something.
If you want me to find a new body for Rebekah,
I want the Fauline diamond you stole from me back in 1914.
What do you plan to do with it?
Does it matter?
Well, it will matter to Klaus.
You see, I could fib here, but I want to be on the up about it.
I need a weapon I can use to protect myself against Klaus, and the diamond helps me make it.
It's not kill him.
Simply a matter of self-defense only to be use out of absolute necessity.
It's a fair trade, Marcel.
I get free of the whackadoodle mum,
I acquire the means by which to defend myself against a volatile brother, should the need arise, and, uh, well, if all goes well, perhaps you'll let me near Davina without bodily harm.
So should I call him back, or should you?
You are made to give Kol that diamond.
Our little brother has been plotting against me for years, and he hasn't got a lick of it right.
I'll take my chances.
Do you know what to do?
Yes, but if it doesn't go to plan, will you handle my body with care, please?
I may miss the old model.
If everything goes south, I'll be there to pull you out.
We just have to take Esther down before she body jumps.
I don't want all of this to have been for nothing.
You and I on the same team.
It must be Christmas.
She's asleep.
It's so quiet with Klaus and Rebekah gone.
So we didn't get to say our wishes.
Can I tell you mine?
It's a hope actually that you'll understand what I have to tell you.
What is it?
My wolves...
I think I figured out a way to release them from the witches.
They could control their turning without the rings and bring peace to our home so that hope could return to us...
But there's a catch.
I have to marry Jackson.
It's, uh, a mystical ceremony and an alpha bonding ritual.
Elijah, I know that you and I haven't been close recently, but...
You have to know that this isn't about him.
I don't love Jackson, but at the same time, I couldn't marry him and still be involved with you.
I don't know.
I should just...
[Music playing]
Marry him.
What?
Listen to me.
The only way that the city will be safe for hope's return is if you have unified your people and I have unified my own, and Davina will eventually lead her witches, and whatever their goal may be,
she is no enemy to your child.
Do what you need to bring your daughter home.
This is my wish for you.
Done!
A per request.
Miss angelica barker.
Good cheek bones and a tummy you can bounce a quarter off.
She will be Rebekah's new host body instead of Cami.
Who's angelica barker?
One of my vampire potentials.
Had to turn her down.
She was too lost.
Does she know what's about to happen to her?
It's better when they don't know, luv.
Hopefully, we won't have to use her.
Hopefully, but then my mother is a wily and vindictive woman, which is why I've got to ask something else of you.
You're already getting the diamond.
Which I'm thrilled about, but in order for me to help you,
I need access to my mother's hourglass, which is in the lycee with my mother.
So?
Well, I haven't been back in a while, and the only way she won't suspect me is if I bring back the thing that I was sent to find.
And that thing is?
The white oak stake.
Are you out of your mind?
Kaleb!
Look.
It's the only way that she's gonna trust me.
She doesn't want to kill them.
She just wants to make sure that the weapon doesn't fall in the wrong hands.
I swear as soon as she's gone,
I'll give it right back to Klaus.
Like hell you will.
Deal's off.
Klaus:
Kol!
Whatever grudges you hold against me, we are doing this for the good of our family.
Do I have your word that for once you will honor that?
You have my word, Nik.
Swear on the fate of us all.
Take the stake.
I wooed her, I won her.
Took a while, but in the end, she handed it to me.
When I didn't hear from you,
I thought you might be in trouble.
Nope.
No trouble.
Just hard to do espionage when you're calling mummy all the time.
So where's Finn.
Is he off playing emperor to his merry pack of dogs?
I'm afraid Finn may have fallen into the hands of your brothers, but I've made a plan to assist him with that dilemma while I continue my search for Rebekah.
Oh.
Speak of the devil, and the devil will come.
Hello, sister.
Kol, it really is you.
I would know that smirk anywhere.
Hello, mother.
I believe you're offering a deal.
Kaleb will link this hourglass to Esther's.
Ours will mirror hers.
When last sand falls, Esther will try to jump her into you.
That's when I'll redirect the spell from you to Esther.
It's meant to jam the signal just long enough to keep that kind of magic from working against anyone.
If it works.
It will work.
When Rebekah attacks,
Esther won't be able to jump her into you or herself anywhere else.
And we're sure Kaleb is on board?
He's on board.
He's a thief and a liar, but like Elijah, he doesn't give his word lightly.
Rebekah:
You can't possibly expect me to discuss giving up eternal life over tea.
Give me some of that red over there.
Pfft.
Well, where's the sales pitch?
I only offer what you already want.
And how do you presume to know that?
Elijah is happiest when there is order and music,
Klaus when he's the center of attention and in control, but you are my only child capable of unfettered joy, and you're happiest amongst humans.
I've seen you year for that life, for love.
And when am I happiest then, mother?
When you're doing as you're told.
Our wishes are aligned in this, my daughter, mine to free you from this curse and yours to be human.
I'd be giving up everything I've ever known for a memory of something I once was, power for weakness, strength for frailty, eternal life for a brief human existence.
The choice is simple.
Another thousand years of never having what you want or a handful of years when you do.
Well, then.
To the end of an era.
I'm in.
Let us begin.
[Whispering]
It's working.
What the bloody hell is that doing here?
As each of you comes to your senses and takes my offer,
I will destroy your vampire bodies.
Mother, you said you wanted the stake to protect them.
Yes, but not in their current bodies.
Once they accept my offer, I will be righting two wrongs...
No.
Having brought this evil into the world and having subjected my own children to it.
No.
That wasn't the deal.
Stop the spell!
The spell is already done.
I prepared it to be locked in the moment I turned over the hourglass.
Marcel:
Now.
Not yet.
Mother, think this through.
You gave birth to this body.
You can't destroy it.
I am only destroying its flesh.
Your beautiful soul will live on in the body of another.
I have chosen well for you, a beautiful girl, strong.
Klaus:
Mother!
Stop the spell.
You and your traitorous son.
Nik, I didn't know anything about it, I swear.
Oh, good.
I'm glad you two boys are friends again.
I did wonder what you'd been up to in your time away.
Now I know.
Stop the blasted spell.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Anything is possible.
- Take me instead.
- Nik, no!
If only you'd taken my offer when it was still mine to give.
Unfortunately, you've left me no choice but to make a deal with Mikael.
Mikael?
When Finn and Kol went missing, I needed a new ally.
All he wanted was the right to kill you.
Kol, I would ask you to deliver the stake to your father, but it seems your loyalties have been compromised.
Stop the spell, Esther!
No.
It's ok, Nik.
I can do this.
So you're feeling murderous again.
You should know I've already chosen my next body.
Now!
[Chanting]
Cami!
Rebekah!
- Did it work?
- I have no idea.
Cami's not awake yet either.
When she's up, we need to get her out of the quarter.
She's not safe here.
Somebody busted Finn out.
My mother is using Mikael to do her dirty work.
Camille?
I suddenly love that stupid name.
I couldn't stop the spell.
Please tell me that your mother's dead.
Rebekah and I took extra precautions.
Esther is exactly where she needs to be.
Davina:
Why are you in such a good mood?
Remember how I said that Rebekah had done me a solid back in 1914?
Swore she hadn't told Klaus that I was taking the diamond back.
I was actually being a bit facetious.
[Music playing]
You're here with my brother.
A word of advice.
A witch as lovely as you has no business dating Kol.
Oh, it's not really a date.
You can do better.
Klaus:
As you know, when the Mikaelsons arrived in Louisiana we brought with us the tradition of holiday bonfire season.
Now we invite you chosen few to join us in our family's own tradition of writing wishes for each other and burning them for lucky.
The holidays are time for celebrating family and friends.
It is especially gratifying in times when treachery runs deep to know you have someone you can trust.
A toast to you, my sister.
To Rebekah!
All:
To Rebekah!
Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize for the disturbance, but what's a Mikaelson family party without a little squabble?
No, no!
Ohh!
[Partygoers gasp]
I've owed her one for a century.
Today, I got to repay that favor.
Oh, don't worry, luv.
Not gonna hurt me own sister.
I didn't exactly prep angelica barker either.
I prepped someone else.
What?
Who?
Oh, it's a bit of a story.
You see, Klaus didn't just punish me for stealing the diamond.
He also punished my witch friends, locking them in the dowager Fauline cottage.
Over the decades, it's become quite a catch-all for an assortment of odd birds of the witchy variety.
I'm sure Rebekah will be very comfortable in the prison created by Klaus.
You didn't.
Oh, I did, and besides, with Rebekah missing, Klaus will be occupied, so we can finish what we started.
You swear she's safe?
Perfectly.
Seeing as this is the best day I've had in the past two centuries, I've made a wish for you.
Close your eyes.
[Music playing]
Hello, mother.
What have you done?
You sold me to that butcher Mikael like I were nothing more than chattel.
Ask me what I have done.
I've done what every good son does, mother.
I've followed the example of my parents.
You taught me exactly how I should treat you.
You must be feeling a little twitchy right about now.
That's what happens when you're in transition.
No.
That's not possible.
Oh, but it is.
You see, you may have thought you were one step ahead of us, but the truth is Rebekah was two ahead of you.
And when am I happiest then, mother?
When you're doing as you're told.
The wine.
You died with vampire blood in your system.
It's a delicious irony because as you know you cannot be both witch and vampire.
So now you either be the thing you hate the most, or you can be dead.
Your choice...
Which is more than you ever gave us.
[Music continues]
Promise is a promise.
[Women screaming]
Let me out!
Someone!
Kol.
Damn it!
I'm not meant to be here.
I'm Rebekah Mikaelson!
I'm Rebekah Mikaelson!
Let me out!
I'm Rebekah Mikaelson!
Previously on "The Originals"...
I presume i have the misfortune of speaking to my mother.
I have come to heal our family.
I'd prefer you both to join me against our mother,
But i'll happily settle for one or the other.
It is time you bring camille in.
Esther prepared your body
For someone to jump into.
She was preparing you for rebekah.
I have the baby, and we're on the run.
Esther found us.
Then she made an offer to make us all mortal again.
[gasps]
Elijah:
We mustn't let the world ever hurt her.
You're right.
Those daggers don't work on klaus.
It's not impossible to change
The dagger itself, so here.
That's a giant diamond.
It's a paragon diamond.
Use them to conduct power.
Klaus, there's something i need to tell you.
You can tell me on the way.
Where are we going?
To see our daughter.
[singing christmas carol]
All right, darling.
You know what to look for.
You sly old bat.
Clean up.
Meet me in the cemetery.
This little beauty and i have a date with a dagger.
Klaus:
You're looking very dapper this evening, kol.
Though gloves without a tailcoat.
Unusual, wouldn't you say, klaus?
I would unless of course the gloves
Are utilitarian in nature.
I didn't realize you two lovebirds
Were interested in fashion.
Oh, i can take it or leave it.
Mayor behrman on the other hand,
Now his style is impeccable,
Especially under present duress.
Do you know he came to me very concerned
About the rash of thefts in the city?
So i put marcel on it.
And after a little digging, i formed a theory
As to the culprit, so we followed our suspect.
And he led us here to the mansion
Of the recently deceased dowager fauline.
She was famous for her collection
Of rare and priceless jewels,
Most notably of course
The perfect paragon diamond.
Hand it over, kol.
[chanting] [banging on doors]
- Kol!
- Get us out of here!
Oh, i wouldn't bother waiting for them.
You see, those women are never
Leaving that house again.
Merry christmas, brother.
[screaming] [music playing]
Rebekah:
Well, isn't this place rather nice?
Nik must have compelled a wine lover
To keep it up because i found a 2005 bordeaux.
Fancy a sip?
I appreciate the sentiment, rebekah,
But i do recognize when i'm being
Handled with kid gloves.
How are you feeling?
Patronized.
I am here to protect you.
I know you mean to, elijah.
And yet you found it necessary to render me unconscious
Before bringing me here.
Well, you weren't yourself,
And i needed to get us out of that diner.
What happened back there?
I don't know.
Niklaus sent me to protect hope.
My job is to keep her safe.
Both:
Pwoteje sa.
Scandalum subsisto venenatis.
Impedit I'ecoulement.
It's finished, but i'm worried it's not enough
To protect cami's body from esther's magic.
I might know a way to distract you
From your troubled mind.
Marcel:
You can take this seriously,
Or i can lock you in a coffin like
Your brother finn if you prefer.
Oh.
No.
I'd prefer you to bugger off
Because this spell needs time to cook in peace.
Cami doesn't have time.
Esther can jump anybody into her body right now.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but she's not gonna jump anybody, is she?
She's gonna jump rebekah,
Who just happens to be miles away,
But fair dues, marcel.
Think i'd be a bit testy, too,
If my old ex was about to jump into my new ex.
I think that would be a big, uh...
Awkward?
I was gonna say kinky, but...
I appreciate the chivalry, marcel,
But he'll have an easier time protecting me
If he's alive.
Keep working.
What is it with you two?
It gets a bit old, being odd man out
In me own family.
You know, klaus, elijah, rebekah,
They were always a party of 3.
No room for me at the table.
There always seemed to be room for marcel.
You know that diamond, the one that i showed you?
Mm-hmm.
Well, that was the baby version.
The one that we need to do the dagger spell,
Well it has to be a lot bigger.
100 years ago, i had it in my hand.
Then marcel ratted me out to klaus,
And they took it.
He probably bloody well kept it.
So let's steal it back.
It's a good chance to snoop.
It's like you're in my mind, davina claire.
[mikael grunting] [bird chirps]
You're making a mess of my werewolf sentries, mikael.
And you're up to your old tricks.
Esther...
I missed you, wife.
Have you missed me?
As much as you've missed me, i imagine.
That would explain why you brought your lover back
From the other side without so much as a thought of me.
I will slaughter every single wolf i see
Until i am taken to the dog
You saw fit to bring back from the dead.
You can stop looking for ansel.
Klaus killed him.
Klaus may not be your blood,
Be he certainly has picked up a few things
From you along the way.
Do not mention the bastard son!
Resolution through violence.
You are nothing if not consistent.
Go ahead.
Strike me.
I imagine you've been
Waiting a thousand years to do so.
Hyah!
Apparaitre apparebis.
Now that you've got that out your system,
We have things to discuss
About our children.
It's all right, elijah.
She won't break.
Everything you did was in the name of protecting her.
I'm not worried.
Is that what i think it is?
It's bonfire season, and i am reviving a family tradition,
Especially since we're all going to be together.
Only because we're fleeing from one of our deranged parents,
Another mikaelson family tradition.
It's a peculiar thing
Never to be tired yet forever exhausted
With the sameness of things.
Why is our family always at war?
I don't know, but being away with her
Made me see things differently.
We're not so bad.
Not the monsters that our parents think we are.
[car approaching]
Hi.
Curse on the first born?
What the bloody hell is that supposed to be?
Well, according to finn, our sister freya
Didn't die of plague.
She was taken as payment by our aunt dahlia,
Who then cursed all mikaelson first borns
For eternity.
Is any of this true?
Elijah:
It is if we're to believe finn,
Who learned it from that bastion of truth, our mother.
Well, no wonder finn hates us.
He lost the sister he adored and instead
Got a judgy pack of siblings,
Who found him unbearably dull.
Great.
So is there any chance of us
Running into your loony aunt dahlia anytime soon?
Fable's over a thousand years old.
Dahlia's long dead.
Like esther?
No one's going to hurt hope
Because no one's going to find her.
It's enough wood, rebekah.
You'll burn down the whole bloody state of arkansas.
Well, we're just missing a key ingredient.
No, we're not.
Yes, we are, nik.
Back me up, elijah.
I suspect niklaus would rather choke on the ashes.
What are you all talking about?
Well, before we light it, we write down
Our wishes for each other to burn for luck.
It was kol's favorite part when were kids.
Further evidence as to why we should ignore it.
Hope's first bonfire season.
I like it.
We're doing it.
You ditched me.
You have my fake therapist locked in that coffin.
What better way to spend my potential final hours.
Try not to think about it.
I can't help it, marcel.
At any moment, i could cease to exist,
And the one person who can make a difference
Is 10 feet away and locked in a box.
I need to talk to him.
You're not talking to finn.
Maybe he'll listen, maybe he'll call his mom off.
It's a million to one, but it's better than doing nothing.
I said no, cami.
Marcel, i am hours away from someone taking control of my body.
I highly suggest you avoid trying to control me
Between now and then.
[music playing]
Here.
I'm holding a small child, hayley.
This silly wish game will have to wait.
You write, i'll hold.
You do realize it is not i who is to be the husband
You can boss around.
You do realize i had to endure horrendous labor
And actual death birthing the child that you're holding.
Fine.
I wish you would tell elijah
You're marrying your werewolf suitor,
At which point i will pour him a scotch
And congratulate him on the bullet he dodged.
Marcel:
I'm only doing this because it means so much to you,
But if it's not safe, i'm staying,
Not to control you, to protect you.
He won't talk to me if you're here, marcel,
And he's in no shape to pick a fight.
I'll be outside.
I'm not much of a cook,
But i do make a mean grilled cheese.
You're a compassionate woman camille.
It's your fatal flaw,
And it will be your downfall.
Well, that got dark fast.
Come on.
Eat.
You must be starving.
I will not be tempted by your beauty,
Nor will i be blinded by your empathy.
You don't leave a girl much wiggle room.
I would appeal to your morals,
But those seem to be all over the map.
I'm not the one who was sleeping with one vampire
While half in love with another.
Your morality is a moving target.
Mine is not.
You believe people can change.
You're still seeking out klaus' redemption
As if that were a thing that was even possible.
Elijah seeks it out.
Even my own mother seeks it out,
But i do not believe in redemption.
I believe in right and wrong.
I believe in good and evil.
Maybe in some comic book universe...
You don't even see it, but i'm trying to help
People like you.
I don't believe you.
That is to your peril because when i'm free
I will not stop until every single vampire
In new orleans has ceased to exist,
And i will show no mercy to anyone
Who dares stand with them.
Not even you.
Lock him back up.
[sighs] [screaming]
Hyah!
[exhales]
Rebekah:
Elijah.
Thank you.
What is it you see when you go away like that?
Things i've done,
Images of who i was.
Another gift from mother.
I can't turn it off.
I suppose it's her way of demonstrating
I'd be better off taking her deal.
To leave your body behind?
To start over,
To live a mortal life,
Have a child of my own if i choose.
Cursed as your first born
If we're to believe the story.
Not if i am no longer mikaelson blood.
See, this is the beauty of mother, rebekah.
Sometimes, even her darkest deeds
Possess a logic that's difficult to refute.
It's a lovely fantasy, elijah.
Rebekah, you and i both know what mother is capable of.
Now i do wonder if she would relent and leave us be.
Now what if all that mother needs is a victory.
Let her find it somewhere else.
Besides, she wants all 3 of us.
She has kol, she has finn.
Perhaps in the end, a simple majority will do.
Is this you?
I was lot better looking back then.
You wish.
What about rebekah?
You never talk about her.
There's not much to say really.
She was always their girl.
There was one time, though, she did me a solid
Back in christmas 1914.
[music playing]
Doing a bit of pilfering before cocktails?
Nik stole something that belongs to me.
I'm simply taking it back.
And i'm simply going to tell nik.
Wait!
What if i said i'm close to finishing a dagger
That would work on him?
You wouldn't dare use it.
Why?
It's no more than he's done to us.
You've suffered at his hands more than anyone,
And it's not like we'd be killing him,
Just giving you some time to be with marcel.
You're entirely serious.
Haven't we both earned the right
To live out of his shadow?
Are you with me, sister?
You can count me in, but do hurry downstairs.
Throw on one of nik's jackets.
He'll notice your absence if you're late.
Hey!
Look what i found.
Wonder if it will work.
Oh, bloody hell.
Come on.
Let's try.
Hey, nik.
Do you think you can cram us into a selfie?
Well, niklaus is the virtuoso
Of cramming his siblings
Into confined spaces.
I'm so glad i traveled hundreds of miles
To visit my mentally ill brother,
Only to have him insult me to my face.
Oh, come on.
Just take the picture.
Hmm.
Hayley:
Aw.
See?
I wish that it could always be like this.
If wishes were horses.
Beggars would ride.
You realize we'll have to burn it.
You want me to make a wish
For the family, rebekah, i wish it didn't
Have to be like this, but it does.
[music playing]
We can't risk it falling into the wrong hands.
No.
This... this isn't right.
We deserve this.
We've earned this.
I won't let it slip away.
I know what to do to stop esther.
Rebekah, no.
I'm gonna take her deal,
And when i do,
I'm taking her down with me.
[music playing]
Rebekah:
It'll work.
She will be distracted during the spell.
She'll be vulnerable.
No.
If we kill her, she body jumps.
Then stop her from jumping.
If i knew how to bloody stop her from jumping,
Don't you think i would have happily murdered her ages ago?
Well, ages ago, you didn't have
A harvest girl or a mikaelson witch.
Kol knows all of her tricks.
Are you both insane?
Hardly, elijah.
It was your idea.
You were the one who said she needed a win,
And if we get this right, then she'll have one.
And if we do it wrong, you're no longer
In your own body.
Would that be the worst thing?
You were ready to do it yourself.
It was a foolish moment
And one that you sagely dissuaded me from.
Hopefully, we'll get lucky
And stop the spell before i jump.
And if we're not, you get what you always wanted.
I mean, that's what you're saying, isn't it?
You're willing to lose.
I'm willing to risk losing, yes.
Well, we need to find someone for her to jump into,
Someone anonymous, someone who could disappear with hope.
Rebekah, we've been together for centuries.
If you were human...
When i'm old and wrinkly,
You can dump me back into my old body.
Nik already has a coffin he can stall me in.
But to trust kol?
It's not about trust, elijah.
It's about finding the proper leverage.
She's right.
Kol will do what's best for koi.
We just have to meet his price.
Be happy to help.
In exchange for what?
From all the sneaking around today,
You're clearly in need of something.
If you want me to find a new body for rebekah,
I want the fauline diamond you stole from me back in 1914.
What do you plan to do with it?
Does it matter?
Well, it will matter to klaus.
You see, i could fib here,
But i want to be on the up about it.
I need a weapon i can use to protect myself against klaus,
And the diamond helps me make it.
It's not kill him.
Simply a matter of self-defense
Only to be used out of absolute necessity.
It's a fair trade, marcel.
I get free of the whackadoodle mum,
I acquire the means by which to defend myself
Against a volatile brother,
Should the need arise, and, uh, well,
If all goes well, perhaps you'll let me near davina
Without bodily harm.
So should i call him back, or should you?
You are made to give kol that diamond.
Our little brother has been plotting against me for years,
And he hasn't got a lick of it right.
I'll take my chances.
Do you know what to do?
Yes, but if it doesn't go to plan,
Will you handle my body with care, please?
I may miss the old model.
If everything goes south,
I'll be there to pull you out.
We just have to take esther down before she body jumps.
I don't want all of this to have been for nothing.
You and i on the same team.
It must be christmas.
She's asleep.
It's so quiet with klaus and rebekah gone.
So we didn't get to say our wishes.
Can i tell you mine?
It's a hope actually
That you'll understand what i have to tell you.
What is it?
My wolves...
i think i figured out
A way to release them from the witches.
They could control their turning without the rings
And bring peace to our home
So that hope could return to us...
But there's a catch.
I have to marry jackson.
It's, uh, a mystical ceremony
And an alpha bonding ritual.
Elijah, i know that you and i haven't been close recently,
But...
You have to know that this isn't about him.
I don't love jackson,
But at the same time, i couldn't marry him
And still be involved with you.
I don't know.
I should just... [music playing]
Marry him.
What?
Listen to me.
The only way that the city will be safe for hope's return
Is if you have unified your people
And i have unified my own,
And davina will eventually lead her witches,
And whatever their goal may be,
She is no enemy to your child.
Do what you need
To bring your daughter home.
This is my wish for you.
Done!
A per request.
Miss angelica barker.
Good cheek bones and a tummy
You can bounce a quarter off.
She will be rebekah's new host body instead of cami.
Who's angelica barker?
One of my vampire potentials.
Had to turn her down.
She was too lost.
Does she know what's about to happen to her?
It's better when they don't know, luv.
Hopefully, we won't have to use her.
Hopefully, but then my mother
Is a wily and vindictive woman,
Which is why i've got to ask something else of you.
You're already getting the diamond.
Which i'm thrilled about,
But in order for me to help you,
I need access to my mother's hourglass,
Which is in the lycee with my mother.
So?
Well, i haven't been back in a while,
And the only way she won't suspect me is if i bring back
The thing that i was sent to find.
And that thing is?
The white oak stake.
Are you out of your mind?
Kaleb!
Look.
It's the only way that she's gonna trust me.
She doesn't want to kill them.
She just wants to make sure that the weapon
Doesn't fall in the wrong hands.
I swear as soon as she's gone,
I'll give it right back to klaus.
Like hell you will.
Deal's off.
Klaus:
Kol!
Whatever grudges you hold against me,
We are doing this for the good of our family.
Do i have your word that for once you will honor that?
You have my word, nik.
Swear on the fate of us all.
Take the stake.
I wooed her, i won her.
Took a while, but in the end,
She handed it to me.
When i didn't hear from you,
I thought you might be in trouble.
Nope.
No trouble.
Just hard to do espionage
When you're calling mummy all the time.
So where's finn.
Is he off playing emperor
To his merry pack of dogs?
I'm afraid finn may have fallen
Into the hands of your brothers,
But i've made a plan to assist him with that dilemma
While i continue my search for rebekah.
Oh.
Speak of the devil, and the devil will come.
Hello, sister.
Kol, it really is you.
I would know that smirk anywhere.
Hello, mother.
I believe you're offering a deal.
Kaleb will link this hourglass to esther's.
Ours will mirror hers.
When last sand falls,
Esther will try to jump her into you.
That's when i'll redirect the spell from you to esther.
It's meant to jam the signal just long enough
To keep that kind of magic from
Working against anyone.
If it works.
It will work.
When rebekah attacks,
Esther won't be able to jump her into you
Or herself anywhere else.
And we're sure kaleb is on board?
He's on board.
He's a thief and a liar,
But like elijah, he doesn't give his word lightly.
Rebekah:
You can't possibly expect me to discuss
Giving up eternal life over tea.
Give me some of that red over there.
Pfft.
Well, where's the sales pitch?
I only offer what you already want.
And how do you presume to know that?
Elijah is happiest when there is order and music,
Klaus when he's the center of attention
And in control,
But you are my only child
Capable of unfettered joy,
And you're happiest amongst humans.
I've seen you year for that life, for love.
And when am i happiest then, mother?
When you're doing as you're told.
Our wishes are aligned in this, my daughter,
Mine to free you from this curse
And yours to be human.
I'd be giving up everything i've ever known
For a memory of something i once was,
Power for weakness, strength for frailty,
Eternal life for a brief human existence.
The choice is simple.
Another thousand years of never having what you want
Or a handful of years when you do.
Well, then.
To the end of an era.
I'm in.
Let us begin.
[whispering]
It's working.
What the bloody hell is that doing here?
As each of you comes to your senses
And takes my offer,
I will destroy your vampire bodies.
Mother, you said you wanted the stake to protect them.
Yes, but not in their current bodies.
Once they accept my offer,
I will be righting two wrongs...
No.
Having brought this evil into the world
And having subjected my own children to it.
No.
That wasn't the deal.
Stop the spell!
The spell is already done.
I prepared it to be locked in
The moment i turned over the hourglass.
Marcel:
Now.
Not yet.
Mother, think this through.
You gave birth to this body.
You can't destroy it.
I am only destroying its flesh.
Your beautiful soul will live on
In the body of another.
I have chosen well for you,
A beautiful girl, strong.
Klaus:
Mother!
Stop the spell.
You and your traitorous son.
Nik, i didn't know anything about it, i swear.
Oh, good.
I'm glad you two boys are friends again.
I did wonder what you'd been up to in your time away.
Now i know.
Stop the blasted spell.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Anything is possible.
- Take me instead.
- Nik, no!
If only you'd taken my offer when it was still mine to give.
Unfortunately, you've left me no choice
But to make a deal with mikael.
Mikael?
When finn and kol went missing,
I needed a new ally.
All he wanted was the right to kill you.
Kol, i would ask you to deliver the stake to your father,
But it seems your loyalties have been compromised.
Stop the spell, esther!
No.
It's ok, nik.
I can do this.
So you're feeling murderous again.
You should know i've already chosen my next body.
Now!
[chanting]
Cami!
Rebekah!
Did it work?
I have no idea.
Cami's not awake yet either.
When she's up, we need to get her out of the quarter.
She's not safe here.
Somebody busted finn out.
My mother is using mikael to do her dirty work.
Camille?
I suddenly love that stupid name.
I couldn't stop the spell.
Please tell me that your mother's dead.
Rebekah and i took extra precautions.
Esther is exactly where she needs to be.
Davina:
Why are you in such a good mood?
Remember how i said that rebekah had done me a solid back in 1914?
Swore she hadn't told klaus that i was taking the diamond back.
I was actually being a bit facetious.
[music playing]
You're here with my brother.
A word of advice.
A witch as lovely as you has no business dating kol.
Oh, it's not really a date.
You can do better.
Klaus:
As you know, when the mikaelsons arrived
In louisiana we brought with us the tradition
Of holiday bonfire season.
Now we invite you chosen few
To join us in our family's own tradition
Of writing wishes for each other
And burning them for lucky.
The holidays are time for celebrating family
And friends.
It is especially gratifying in times
When treachery runs deep
To know you have someone you can trust.
A toast to you, my sister.
To rebekah!
All:
To rebekah!
Ladies and gentlemen, i apologize for the disturbance,
But what's a mikaelson family party
Without a little squabble?
No, no!
Ohh!
[partygoers gasp]
I've owed her one for a century.
Today, i got to repay that favor.
Oh, don't worry, luv.
Not gonna hurt me own sister.
I didn't exactly prep angelica barker either.
I prepped someone else.
What?
Who?
Oh, it's a bit of a story.
You see, klaus didn't just punish me
For stealing the diamond.
He also punished my witch friends,
Locking them in the dowager fauline cottage.
Over the decades, it's become quite a catch-all
For an assortment of odd birds
Of the witchy variety.
I'm sure rebekah will be very comfortable
In the prison created by klaus.
You didn't.
Oh, i did, and besides,
With rebekah missing, klaus will be occupied,
So we can finish what we started.
You swear she's safe?
Perfectly.
Seeing as this is the best day i've had
In the past two centuries,
I've made a wish for you.
Close your eyes.
[music playing]
Hello, mother.
What have you done?
You sold me to that butcher mikael
Like i were nothing more than chattel.
Ask me what i have done.
I've done what every good son does, mother.
I've followed the example of my parents.
You taught me exactly how i should treat you.
You must be feeling a little twitchy right about now.
That's what happens when you're in transition.
No.
That's not possible.
Oh, but it is.
You see, you may have thought you were one step ahead of us,
But the truth is rebekah was two ahead of you.
And when am i happiest then, mother?
When you're doing as you're told.
The wine.
You died with vampire blood in your system.
It's a delicious irony because as you know
You cannot be both witch and vampire.
So now you either be the thing you hate the most,
Or you can be dead.
Your choice...
Which is more than you ever gave us.
[music continues]
Promise is a promise.
[women screaming]
Let me out!
Someone!
Kol.
Damn it!
I'm not meant to be here.
I'm rebekah mikaelson!
I'm rebekah mikaelson!
I'm rebekah mikaelson!
This is not a dream.
This is not a dream.
Okay.
Okay.
This is not a dream.
This is not a dream.
This is not a dream.
Not a dream.
How did I get here?
I don't know.
Somebody just transferred me here.
I don't wanna give you my information again.
I just told someone 5 times.
Can one of you behave like a real person, please?
I'm calling about...
Right, yes, I'm her son.
What kind of cancer are we talking about?
What are our options?
What about a liver transplant?
Why not?
Ask about her Child-Pugh score.
Trust me.
What's her Child-Pugh score?
B. Uh...
What about her bilirubin levels?
If they're low enough, they might consider yttrium-90.
Hold on.
You have really bad social skills.
Can you pretend to not listen to my conversation?
Nobody likes that guy.
Don't be that guy.
Eyes on the prize.
Yeah.
What about yttrium-90?
Her bilirubin levels are too high.
Okay, listen.
I'm gonna get on a flight in the morning.
Uh, so I should be at the hospital by 3.
Just have her call me tonight, so I know I'm wanted.
Thanks.
Fuck.
- This is about your mom?
- Yeah.
How long are they giving her?
I don't know, a few years.
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.
What are you doing?
I gotta roll a joint before the meteor shower starts.
Why?
We're about to watch a fucking meteor shower. "Why."
Oh, here.
That's for when you apply to college in a few years.
Use me as a reference.
You're a postdoctoral scientist at Tristana Pharmaceuticals.
- Yup.
- So you already knew...
Oh, that cancery stuff, yeah, I did.
Anyway, I should be able to help you get you into a top ten pre-med in a few years.
What makes you think I wanna go pre-med?
Well, other than the fact that you know what yttrium-90 is when most of your peers are still battling to crack the mysteries of parallel parking.
That's just because my mom...
Your mom died of liver cancer.
Yeah, I know.
Your book bag has a cancer ribbon pinned to what could only be a picture of your mom.
She fits the age range.
And you guys have the same nose bridge.
Makes sense you wanting to become a doctor that saves people.
Right?
To make up for the doctor that couldn't save your mom.
Then, with time, those good intentions will fade and it'll become about the money like it always does.
And you'll become bitter, like everyone always becomes.
And then you die, probably from cancer.
You know, because that's ironic.
Is there something wrong with you?
Probably, yeah.
Don't worry, I'm working on it.
I just fired my therapist.
She was such an idiot though.
She diagnosed me with narcissistic personality disorder.
She said I'm under the grand delusion that I'm the smartest person in the world.
To which I responded, "What if I really am?"
- You know?
- Hey, over here.
Watch out!
You okay?
You alright?
This... this doesn't feel real.
What?
I feel like my life just flashed before my eyes, you know, like in a movie where the main character dies in the beginning but he keeps going, not realizing he's dead.
Hey, what's that movie I'm talking about?
You know what I mean.
It's like, um...
What is it?
It's...
Oh, um, sure, uh, yeah.
Like, uh, Bruce Willis in "The Sixth Sense?"
Exactly.
Yeah.
Wait, no.
You know what, I never saw that.
Shit.
That's the twist that everyone was talking about?
Bruce Willis dies in the beginning of that.
That sucks.
Ah, I really wanted to see that.
Fuck.
I'm sorry.
I guess I just thought everyone had seen it.
No, don't worry.
Now, I'm not that mad.
I mean I am, but I'll get over it.
That's a lie.
I'll probably harbor this for a few months at least and then, you know, we'll see.
See what happens.
Oh, that's cute.
Do you have an eating problem?
Oh, not like...
Sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.
Dude, come on, you do realize my date isn't the one with the eating problem, right?
Oh.
Wha...
Uh-oh, Kimberly's annoyed.
Kimberly.
Kimberly.
Hey.
- How do you do that?
- What?
I haven't seen you in a year when I was literally just thinking about you.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
Because of that song.
I was listening to it as I was walking here.
It reminded me of the hotel.
The one we stayed at for my friend's wedding in Paris.
Yeah, yeah, Paris.
City of Lights and pretension as I recall.
We had one of our biggest fights.
And that was your friend's wedding from Wisconsin, right?
What was her name, Lenora or Lee Anora?
- Sarah?
Right.
- I remember that wedding.
I remember that was the one where the DJ played that Montell Jordan song twice.
I remember, the first time we thought it was ironic then we realized he just liked the song.
Definitely our biggest fight.
The beginning of the end, really.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Look, It's like the Beatles, right?
I mean, I liked them when I was 5.
But at a certain point, you just want something with a little more nuance, you know?
Don't get me wrong.
I could handle them a little better when they had Pete Best to ground them but past that, I don't know, they just got so pedestrian.
- Do you come here a lot?
- Do I come to the cemetery?
I like cemeteries.
You know, they're romantic.
Especially this one.
Soccer is by far the most elegant sport.
Yeah, I read somewhere it's gonna overtake football in America in the next 2 years.
- Really?
2 years?
- A friend of mine described it.
Clock's ticking.
He blogged, "Soccer's...
soccer's chess on a field."
Do you have a vomit bag...
vomit bags on you?
I'll send you the link.
I guess we could just...
I'd hate to throw up on a grave.
Why didn't you just go to the Griffith Park Observatory then to watch the meteor shower?
Oh, they have assholes there too.
Trust me.
There're assholes all over the city
But rarely do you get to be next to one so spectacular.
The only knock on him though, I have to say, is that he's from New York.
I can't stand that place.
Seriously.
It's so overrated.
Why?
Because of all the bridges and the culture and the history they have?
Who needs it?
I'll take Orlando any day.
They got so many more T.G.I. Fridays.
Do I love L.A.?
You know, Los Angeles is just more modern.
It has a certain relevancy about it
New York just doesn't have anymore.
Kimberly, I was wondering if I could have your number?
- What?
- Your phone number?
Dude... she's with me.
No.
- Uh, yeah, she is.
- No, she's not.
Not yet anyway.
At best, this is a first date.
And I'm shocked that that even happened.
I have nothing against you.
You might not be a bad guy.
Most likely you are but maybe not.
You're incredibly handsome and you were probably very handsome when you were a kid, too.
I think that explains your lack of substance and personality.
Only because nobody's ever really challenged you before.
So now as an adult you think everything you say means something, but it means nothing actually.
You don't know what you're talking about.
And it's really upsetting.
And I think she probably sees through that.
You're very pretty, but you're shallow beyond belief.
Anyway, can I have your number?
- Okay, okay.
- What are you doing?
You just said all that shit.
Yeah, but it was just an observation.
And you ask my girl out in front of me?
Oh, shit.
Sorry, my mistake.
I see that now.
I shouldn't have done that.
She's way too beautiful.
What?
No.
I just should be more of a realist.
I should know that I'm a C, maybe a C plus in the winter time when I can cover up my body more.
And even though you're a douche bag, you're still incredibly attractive.
So maybe it's only fair you two pair.
- What?
It rhymed.
- She's right, it rhymed.
Let's...
Can you just put me down?
This is embarrassing now for everyone.
Okay.
Come on, Josh.
The line's moving.
- Let's...
Let's just go.
Come on.
- Oh, yeah...
Gotta get a good seat.
The only thing wrong with you is you're chicken shit.
That's all.
- That's not the only problem.
- Let's go.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
- One of many.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
I shouldn't have talked.
That's when I get into trouble.
I'm sorry I made fun of your sandwich bag.
I didn't mean to.
Actually, that's not true, I did.
Sorry.
I'm really nervous.
It's okay.
I'm sorry he bothered you.
I was not nervous because of him.
Okay.
Bye.
She is so...
Beautiful.
Kim, come on, the wedding's in an hour.
You gotta get ready.
So... have you ever dreamt about me?
- Dreamt about you?
- Yeah.
You know, in the 700 plus days we've dated.
You ever dreamt about me?
So...
Yeah, of course.
Oh, yeah?
Like, uh, sex dreams?
At first, but then we had sex, and that went away.
Ha.
Is that how you really wanna say that?
So I was all hot to trot for you or whatever in the beginning.
And now, you know, reality has set in.
But that's not what I meant.
I meant like...
A dream, like ambiguous depictions of what we are or were, or could be.
Stuff like that.
Can you stop already?
I got it.
- Why, I oughta...
- Oh, hey, whoo.
Put that down.
You're gonna hurt yourself.
- What are you doing?
- I'm a give you what for.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
You good?
Okay.
Okay.
That was fun.
Does it bother you that you don't make me happy?
- Always with the jokes.
- I'm serious.
Seriously?
You went from sex dreams to not being happy?
False.
I wasn't talking about sex dreams, you were.
And secondly, I'm a girl, so yes, we non-sequitur.
- That's a little cliched.
- I want a baby.
Point taken.
Seriously.
Don't you want a baby?
Someday, sure.
But let's burn that bridge when we get to it, okay?
See?
Not making me happy.
How do you do that?
How do you do that?
Oh, my God.
She's beautiful.
She's beyond beautiful.
And she's real.
She seems funny, too.
And there's a hint of crazy, I can feel it.
Beautiful, crazy, and funny.
Jesus Christ.
She's perfect.
It's really annoying.
Really...
That's two near collisions for you now in a row.
Well, at least this one's nonfatal.
Okay.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Bye.
- Uh, yeah.
What the fuck was that?
Wait.
Wait.
What are we doing?
Are we in a chase scene now?
What are we doing?
Wait, just stop for a second.
So I thought I saw somebody, a friend of mine behind you coming over.
So that's why I turned around and waited.
So what's the big deal?
It wasn't because you were watching me?
Because it looked like you were kinda watching me.
No, it was because of a friend that was behind you.
So they're not there now obviously.
Besides, you were being weird.
You were talking to yourself.
What were you saying anyway?
You say "so" a lot.
It's really annoying.
So...
Are you trying to make this awkward now?
- It feels awkward now.
- Awkward feels good to me.
And awkward feels awkward to me.
That's a little on the nose, don't you think?
I'm not trying to fuck you.
If that's what you're worried about, I mean.
I'm not gonna ask you out because I don't believe in love.
I think all relationships deteriorate into hate indifference or...
Well, yeah, those two things.
My parents have been together for 32 years.
- And they're happily in love.
- No, they're not.
- Yes, they are.
- No, they're not.
If they haven't divorced by now probably means they've just surrendered to the fact that being apart isn't much better than being together.
You know, the lesser of two evils.
Trust me, it's like an emotional holocaust between your parents right now.
They probably have lukewarm feelings about you too.
I'm Dell, by the way.
So, no offense, but I have a-a thing about shaking hands.
Oh, my God.
You are a little crazy.
That's great.
- You're not impressing me.
- I disagree.
You know, you should stop trying to sound so smart all the time.
You just wind up sounding really dumb.
It's just I realized why you date guys like that.
You have terrible taste in men because you're superficial.
You're fooling yourself in the hopes of finding something redeemable.
It's because of love.
That's your blind spot.
You gotta give up on that.
Wow.
Okay.
Well, I thank you for your insight, stranger but I actually believe love is real.
I'm gonna go now.
Wait.
Can I still get your...
- Hello, boyfriend.
- Hey.
Hey, listen, Roxette's on, and the good part is coming up.
Can I call you back?
Wait-wait, I just have to tell you something more important really quick.
You know that book I've been reading, "The Selfish Gene" by Richard Dawkins... ♪ Leave the winter on the ground ♪
There's this fascinating part I just read about memes.
He basically says that ideas are like genes that self-replicate and mutate like a cultural form of evolution... ♪ Touch me now, I close my eyes... ♪
I was thinking how that applies to us, you know?
The idea of us, how we've really mutated and evolved... ♪ And it's a hard winter's day... ♪
Right?
because you think about it, we were just dumb, young kids when we first met.
And then we broke up, got back together, blah blah blah.
And now, we're this really mature, loving couple who's grown respect and admiration for each other.
You know what I mean?
Kimberly?
You hung up on me, didn't you?
♪ But it's over now ♪
♪ From the moment we touched ♪
♪ Until the time had run out ♪
♪ Yeah ♪♪
Well, maybe you could.
Well, because I'd like her to be at the best place.
Well, then maybe you can introduce me to the head guy at the cancer immunology lab.
Because I've taken an interest, that's all.
Yes, mom, I meditated.
I meditate before every date, but it didn't help.
Face facts, no one thinks I'm special but you.
Well, I'm still technically on it.
But it's not working out, trust me.
He called himself a Bob Dylan song and then proceeded to call me a Britney Spears song.
I don't know what it means either, but it sounds insulting.
No, not him.
Uh, the one with glasses, mustache.
Looks like a child trafficker.
Yeah, yeah, that's the one.
Well, if I...
I gotta go.
I gotta go.
Can I ask you a serious question?
Do you think I have terrible taste in men?
Okay, I'm back.
Uh-huh.
- Well, I'm at...
- I have to talk to you.
- I'm on the phone.
- No, it's really important.
- Really important.
- I'm on the friggin' phone.
Have you ever cried at one of these things?
I was wondering.
Mom, I have to go.
Something weird is happening.
- One of what things?
- These meteor shower things.
Cried?
Yeah, you know, like tears of joy, that kind of thing.
No.
I've never cried at one of these things.
Neither have I. Ever, ever.
In fact, I don't understand people that do.
It's kind of bullshit, happy crying is, isn't it?
What are your thoughts on that?
So I was on the phone.
So, yeah, you were on the phone.
Sorry.
Was it important?
More important than your question?
- Yes.
- Yes.
My mistake.
Sorry.
I'll never interrupt you again.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Well...
I should get back to my date.
He's probably...
But I just wanna keep talking to you.
- What?
- I wanna keep talking to you for multiple reasons.
I mean, you're beautiful, but it's more than that.
I promise.
That's very nice, but I should go.
Maybe I'll see you in the winter when you're a C plus.
See?
I knew it.
I knew you were superficial.
I told you.
The only reason that you're talking to me is because you think I'm hot.
Yeah, but the only reason why you won't is because you think I'm not.
Fine.
Give me a reason why I should?
I was saying, "Don't miss her."
Earlier, when you saw me talking to myself.
I was saying, "Don't miss her."
I'm always so afraid I'm gonna miss the important things in life.
Something about you has given me a heightened curiosity to know you better.
And that is a near impossible feat when it comes to me because I hate getting to know people.
But I can tell you're not like the others.
- What others?
- People.
People?
You can tell I'm not a person?
Yeah, you're not phony like them.
Also, I didn't say you were hot.
I said you are beautiful.
When is this dumb thing gonna happen?
It's a beautiful night though.
What?
I never know what that means when people say that it's a beautiful night?
What does it mean?
So... well, to me means it's comfortable, familiar...
Yet deeply moving.
Right, no...
I feel you like, uh, like getting stoned and listening to Steely Dan.
No.
Nothing at all like that.
No...
I know.
More like...
Yeah, like...
Floating down a serene lake in a rowboat when the sun is setting or rising... or when the sun is being a part of nature.
- Stop speaking.
- Okay.
It's beautiful when the weather is not hot or cold.
Kinda like you don't notice it.
Kinda like it's perfect because everything is so balanced.
You don't even feel it.
And while you're feeling that non-feeling you look up in the sky and you almost think that's why.
Because how everything is right now, all the stars and planets and us and the ground, and the cells and molecules right now... is exactly the reason why now is comfortable.
- You're a now person.
- True.
Yeah, see, I'm a 5-minutes-from-now person.
Because 5 minutes from now, a gust of wind could come in and blow H1N1 in everyone's eyes.
Right.
Except that's highly unlikely.
Or 5 minutes from now, an earthquake could erupt and swallow us all whole.
Right.
Except that...
No, shit, that could actually happen.
Yeah.
The point is I'm way too anxious about what could happen 5 minutes from now to be content with now.
Can't do it.
What if something good happens 5 minutes from now?
- Can't that happen?
- No.
What did you think was gonna happen 5 minutes before you met me?
I'm just really paranoid I'm gonna miss it.
I miss things a lot.
I don't care if I miss it because...
You're a now person.
Got it.
So another weird thing.
I don't mind your pessimism as much as I usually mind pessimism.
That's great.
I hate people who think I'm too negative.
Also, I like your hat.
Yeah, I'm probably gonna fall in love with you.
Wow.
That's it?
What were you hoping for?
I'm going to fall in love with you, too?
No, but...
Well, yeah.
So all that stuff about not believing in relationships...
Oh, that's just a pick-up line.
Do we have a deal then?
Cause you said you believe in love.
I don't.
Let's put it to the test.
Date each other.
Me and you.
In a relationship.
Let's do it.
Why the hell am I shaking your hand?
I should be scared to death of who you are as a person.
Instead, I'm scared to death of weddings.
Death.
Literally.
I'd probably have a coronary right as I'm walking up the aisle.
Oh, God, please invite me to your wedding.
I would love to see that.
Well, that's morbid and telling.
Yeah, well, if snuff films were readily available
I'd probably watch them, not gonna lie.
Is that a deal breaker for you?
No, because for some reason
I still happen to be in love with you.
No, it's because you didn't think that you'd be the one marrying me.
You don't smoke weed.
What are you doing?
Don't do that.
So do you still love me?
I tell you all the time, if you died right now
I'd visit your grave every single day.
Not every day, that's crazy.
That doesn't answer the question.
Of course, I love you.
It never sounds real when you say it.
Like it doesn't exist.
So what are you doing here?
- Going up north.
- Why would you do that?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
I'm...
I'm kidding.
I'm going to meet someone.
So right, okay.
- How's your mom doing?
- She's actually fine.
I can't believe I haven't talked to you this long.
Yeah, turns out her doctors are huge idiots.
So I kinda took matters in my own hand.
I figured out a way to dose her with that experimental drug we've been developing in our lab.
Wait.
Are you allowed to do that?
No.
Wasn't that extremely dangerous?
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
- She's fine now?
Yeah, completely.
She's in remission.
So...
- Dell, that's great.
- Yeah.
I mean, other than the totally-unethical-recklessly- risking-your-mom's-life part.
That's... that's, You... you saved her.
Yeah, I guess.
We should probably keep that between us... by the way
Because there's a good chance what I did was illegal... ish.
Right.
- Oh.
- All aboard.
Right.
We should probably...
Okay, right.
Well, still, wow.
I can't believe you're curing cancer now.
Does that mean you've stopped hating people?
Not at all.
Kill Zelda Fitzgerald.
Right?
Who is that?
- Really?
- I don't know who that is.
F. Scott Fitzgerald's annoying... wife.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
Oh.
I'd definitely marry Rita Hayworth.
Great hair.
Hair, right.
Guys love her hair.
I definitely have to shit out of this one.
Olga Kordinstitch?
Who is that?
I don't know.
I've just always wanted to fuck an Olga.
I would definitely marry Tupac.
Kimberly Shakur.
It's got a good ring to it.
I would definitely "F" Edward R. Murrow.
I picture him starting up sex with
"Good night, and good luck."
I'd probably laugh so much that I'd have an orgasm right then and there.
From the laughter, you know?
I lied about not seeing "The Sixth Sense."
Of course I saw it.
Everybody saw it.
It's amazing.
Who didn't see "The Sixth Sense?"
Why would you lie about that?
I read in a woman's magazine that every relationship whether it be short term, or long term there's usually, like, one big lie relative to that relationship and I just...
I wanted to get mine over with, I guess.
Why would you want to get a jump start on the lying?
Because...
Because of five minutes from now.
Well, yeah...
You're assuming that we're in a relationship or going to be when I'm still technically on a date with someone else.
Which I should probably be getting back to. by the way.
What about the handshake?
We shook hands.
You can't do that.
I was leading you on.
That's really fucked up.
That's the business.
Well, what about a friendship?
Actually, what am I talking about?
I definitely don't want to be friends with you.
I was raped.
In high school.
By the quarterback...
of the football team.
Jesus.
I know.
That is a terrible lie.
Hey!
How do you know that's a lie?
You were raped in high school by the quarterback of the football team?
I don't think after-school specials are that cliched.
You couldn't have gone with, like, a cornerback or defensive end or something?
Well, I was just trying to get mine over with.
- Get what over who?
- My lie to you.
- You can't.
- Why can't?
Because I saw it coming, because we just talked about it.
You've got to wait until I'm in a completely vulnerable position where I'd really fall for it.
That sounds really dangerous.
Oh, yeah, that's the problem with relationships.
Danger?
- Or worse.
- Worse?
You could change the other person.
You're a very broken man, Dell.
In theory.
Speaking of broken men, your goateed Philistine is sashaying towards us.
- Run!
- What?
- Run!
- What?
Run!
Well, that's settled.
Wanna hit?
No way.
It has a weird effect on me.
For some reason, when I'm high, I think people can't hear me and I start speaking really loudly.
Do you remember memorizing phone numbers?
I don't remember the last time I memorized a phone number.
I don't either, actually.
Remember checking the newspaper for movie showtimes?
Remember that?
Or writing people those notes in those, like, folded-up triangles and then putting them in their lockers.
Do you think kids still do that?
As opposed to just e-mails or texts?
No way.
It's all about e-mails and texts with those goddamn hugs and kisses.
I hate those things.
Whenever anybody e-mails me hugs and kisses
I wanna just e-mail them back oral and penetration.
Are we old?
Are we talking like old people?
Are we on the verge of joining the sweatpants culture?
Was I just saying something?
What?
Was I?
Give me that.
- Why?
- Give me that.
Okay, that's it for you.
I think you should start drinking some coffee.
Okay?
See, that's why I hate time.
I believe I want to have sex with you now.
I believe I share in that belief.
Hey, uh, uh...
Okay.
We gotta get ready.
Come on.
What the F?
I thought we were gonna make it!
I know, but we gotta go, Kim.
Really.
What's that?
What is that?
You ordered Chinese food?
Who orders Chinese food in Paris?
Kim, they're going to have dinner at the wedding, you know?
The wedding that we're supposed to go to in half an hour.
And you just ate lunch.
You're not full?
What does that have to do with anything?
Oh, Jesus.
This is the pot talking.
You shouldn't have smoked.
I knew it.
You gotta get ready.
What are you doing?
You made me promise to get you down there on time no matter what.
You warned me you would do this.
See, this is why I hate time.
I can't enjoy my sesame chicken because of it.
Kim.
Wish I could just stop it or something.
Or at least just make it pause when needed, like now.
Or better yet, just get rid of it altogether.
You wanna get rid of time?
How would you do that?
You know how there's time-based art?
Movies, music, plays, it's all time-based art.
There's a beginning, and a middle and an end.
You have to see it from the beginning to the end.
You're restrained to that timeline...
That way of experiencing it.
But then there's paintings.
No beginning, no middle, no end.
You see what you want to see when you want to see it.
No restrictions, it's just there.
Okay, so you want life to be a painting?
Great.
What?
Thanks.
So, do you know you really love me?
So, what's in your pocket?
My wallet.
It's stuffed with our saved movie ticket stubs because I'm a romantic like that.
Can you please get ready?
Shhh!
Can't you see, I'm trying to touch my toes?
I really don't want to be that couple that's always late for things.
Can we please not be that couple?
At least for the tenure of our relationship?
Please.
You did it again!
What?
What, I'm just saying I want us to respect time.
Not that.
Okay, what then?
What did I do that I did twice now and still not know?
You said "the tenure of our relationship."
You keep speaking about our relationship as if it's ending.
Okay.
You see how this relates to the time thing?
Why don't you take your own advice and instead of seeing a beginning, middle, and end, just see it as a painting.
Kimberly!
What are you doing?
We're going to be late!
And I'm gonna somehow get blamed for it, I know it.
What are you reading?
Roald Dahl short stories.
So, is it about a girl?
Is it about a new girl you're going up north?
A new girlfriend you're not telling me because you think it'll make it awkward...
Yeah.
So, right.
Okay.
New girl.
I love Roald Dahl.
He's the best.
Which one are you reading?
And are you sleeping with anyone?
The one about Hitler.
And yes.
Shit.
I didn't know he wrote one about Hitler.
Uh... kind of.
It's about this doctor that saves this woman's life.
She's on the verge of death through the whole delivery.
And this doctor is so determined to save this woman's life and the life of her unborn child, right?
But, it turns out that the child is Hitler.
Okay, uh...
Did you just give away the ending?
How was I supposed to tell you what the story was about without giving away the ending?
What are you talking about?
Just say...
It's a story about a doctor who saves a woman from a potentially fatal pregnancy?
- Because that's what the story is about.
- It is.
False, birdbrain.
That is not what the story is about.
It's about the irony that the baby's Hitler.
- Okay, you're mad.
- I'm not mad.
- You're mad 'cause of the girl.
- I'm seeing a guy.
Jack.
You're seeing a Jack?
He's an executive at MTV.
Looks like a cross between Salvador Dali and Dwayne Wayne from "A Different World," which is hot.
That's a weird combination.
I gotta go to the bathroom really quick.
Well, that... fucking...
Hurt.
What?
You hung up on me.
What happened?
Because.
Okay, you realize that's not an answer to my question, right?
What is it that I can help you with, sir?
I don't know.
Have I told you how much New York reminds of why I hate L.A. so much?
No, please do, because the New Yorker who opines the inferiorities of Los Angeles is bursting with originality.
I'm serious, Kimberly we gotta move here, it is the fucking best.
It's enough already with L.A.
It's like a mix of moral nihilism and Disneyland.
So are you.
Hey, did I tell you the proof of concept on our drug passed with flying colors?
There's actually a bidding war between a few pharmas right now.
Looks like we could be licensing it for close to 25 million.
Money for soul seems like...
An even swap, yes, it's not like I'm not happy for you but you did already tell me this all this morning, remember?
- Did I really?
- Uh-huh.
Oh shit, my short-term memory must be shot.
What with the smoking pot and whatnot.
I'm your new second-term girlfriend, man aren't you supposed to be, like, impressing me still?
Your second-term boyfriend just told you he made his bosses close to 25 million dollars today.
I'm not materialistic.
I know that, but 25 million dollars sort of, I don't know, makes that sound retarded.
Okay, seeing as there's no new information in this call
I am going to go.
I'm almost at the gun range.
Hey, don't you think it's cute that you own a gun card and I own a pot card?
Now you sound retarded.
Listen, we should probably stop saying retarded.
I'm starting to feel like an asshole.
Oh, is that just now starting?
What's going on?
You sound off.
You're off.
No, no, no, I'm serious.
Your cadence is all over the place.
You sound a little like Miss Teschmacher when she betrayed Lex Luthor.
Something's wrong, I can tell.
What's going on?
Oh, God, this is gonna blow.
What's going on?
Oh, shit, this is bad, isn't it?
This is like infidelity bad.
I definitely heard a silence just now!
What is going on?
!
You okay?
Yeah, you okay?
So... it's been a while.
Yup.
- I'm glad you're finally here.
- Yeah, me too.
I've been trying to get a hold of you for a long time now.
Do you want a tour of the place?
No.
Oh, okay.
Seriously?
Oh, yeah.
You know I don't care about stupid shit like that.
Right, sorry, I've adjusted to normal people so your presence is gonna take some realignment.
You moving?
Uh, no, kind... kind of.
Um, do you want anything, by the way?
Like, uh...
I want to talk.
What?
Nothing, for a second I...
I forgot what you looked like.
For the record, I've never forgotten what you looked like.
Okay, chill out, okay.
I didn't sleep with anyone!
Okay, did you see and/or touch another man's penis in any way?
Really?
Out of all the things you want to know this is what you wanna ask me the most?
What kinda question is that.
Of course that's what I want to know the most!
No.
Penises were not involved.
Were your boobs and/or vagina...
No.
It was texts.
That's all it was.
I should never have gone against my own advice.
I should always be the better looking one in the relationship but I just sort of hit an impasse on that.
Honestly, gosh, Dell, do you really think that that...
Who was it?
It was my in-between ex...
Jack.
Jack, the MTV exec?
Are you fucking serious?
I thought you hated MTV!
Isn't he short?
He's not tall.
Wha...
Are you seriously defending him?
You can't call him short, you have to go with "not tall?"
Jesus, you like him?
Why the fuck are you being so sangfroid over this shit?
You're being way too easy on yourself!
You should know I'm standing in the middle of a monsoon right now.
Well... so, maybe I should let you go then?
Why?
Because I'm standing in the middle of a monsoon?
No, because you...
Yes, because you're standing in the middle of a monsoon!
Um...
Are you okay?
What are you staring at?
Oh, my thesis.
That reminds me.
I've been keeping articles about you.
They said that your drug led to major breakthroughs in cancer treatment.
It's amazing, Dell.
Your mom, especially, must be proud.
- That's me and...
- Jack.
How long have you guys been engaged?
So... what are you talking about?
You've boxed up a lot of old kitchen appliances over there which means you've either declared a fatwa on General Electric or you're wedding registering the fuck out of your friends and family.
You've been fidgeting with your ring finger non-stop.
You're also giving me that look like you're trying to think of a lie real quick.
I might beat the shit out of you.
The wedding's in a few weeks.
Question is, where's the ring?
It's getting sized.
Huh?
Question number two, why didn't you tell me?
I was going to tell you before you did your whole annoying MacGyver thing.
I don't think that's the reference you're looking for.
Does Jack even know I'm here?
Trust me, he knows you're here.
What does that mean?
Why did you scoff?
What scoff?
I didn't scoff.
You scoffed.
You guys fought about me coming.
I'm actually kind of flattered, didn't know yours truly could threaten the evil prince of the MTV generation.
First of all, Jack's leaving MTV.
His article in Esquire was optioned by George Clooney.
Yeah, well, I won my fantasy baseball league last year.
Let's not talk about Jack, okay?
I'm happy to not talk about Jack.
What's the smoking rule in here?
Is he making a face?
Is that...
That's just how he looks.
So, I had a very vivid dream the other night about us.
A vivid dream?
What was it about, this vivid dream?
It was a dream of memories.
'Uh, conversations that we've had.'
'I saved your life.'
You owe the person that saved you, don't you think?
You had a dream that was really a series of memories of conversations we've had?
Yeah, don't hurt yourself, it's not that complicated.
Cause to the brain, there's no difference between reality and dreams.
They were just memories of us over the years.
What if I don't subscribe to a culture of indentured servitude?
You can't unsubscribe.
It's a thing of nature it's here to stay.
They weaved in and out of each other like those M.C. Escher drawings.
So, one second I'd be on that train that time we got back together after our first breakup another second I was on the phone in New York.
The last time we ever talked to each other.
But they blended together like a...
Painting?
I saved your life.
If it weren't for me, you would have been run over by that car.
You would have been splat just like my timeless life painting thing.
And they were all real...
But there was one moment in the dream that was, um...
Well, it... it...
it was one we never had, it was the only one.
What was it about?
This made-up moment?
It's gonna sound weird, but it was us talking after not having talked for however long.
So, wait, I'm confused.
It was...
This moment.
This moment that we're having right now.
So me coming over, seeing your apartment, your life with Jack and reconnecting...
Oh, God, I feel sick.
I blame L.A. for this.
This is what happens when you fall in love in Los Angeles.
Fuck!
So, what is this?
Are you breaking up with me?
I don't want to, no.
But you like this Jack guy, right?
Do you realize Jack Tripper was one of my favorite characters in all of fiction and you've forever ruined his good name?
Shit!
Can I...
Shit, I can't even order a Jack and Coke anymore!
A vodka soda!
A vodka soda?
My life is ruined!
Okay.
We should just get off the phone, okay.
You're mad, and any words we exchange now are gonna be bleak at best...
I can't believe this.
You used to never want to get off the phone.
No, I used to want to get off the phone, I just used to not.
And now you can't wait togetoffthe phone.
I don't even know what we're fighting about anymore, okay.
If you wanna yell at me about Jack, fine, but I'm too tired for another one of your meta arguments.
I don't deserve to be treated like this.
I thought you were supposed to be my indentured servant?
Whatever happened to that, huh?
So, what are you talking about right now?
I'm talking about that-that prescription to life thing.
Right, except it's subscription to nature.
Whatever.
No, you have this backwards, kid, I saved your life.
But then I saved your life.
When were on the train, we ran into each other, and we got back together.
You mean, when you stalked and followed me onto the train?
I saved your life because you got off at Chico.
You weren't supposed to get off at Chico.
You were supposed to go on to Portland, but because of me you got off at Chico instead and you weren't on the train when it derailed.
You could have died.
No one died, Dell.
The point remains...
No, that's not the same, okay.
You would absolutely have died had I not saved you.
Plus, I saw that car coming.
I knew it was going to hit you, and I saved you.
I knowingly saved you.
Yeah, well, that's starting to feel like a minus, not a plus.
Be that as it may, you didn't know you were saving me.
You were just trying to get back in my pants.
No!
I was trying to get you back!
Which just happens to include getting into your pants.
So yours was a sinister doing, mine was pure altruism.
But I knowingly saved you too.
We just went over this, pothead...
You were supposed to get off at Portland to meet Jack but I knowingly saved you from him.
Except I didn't, did I?
Fuck!
I should have told you I loved you more.
When we were together, I mean.
I was also such a dick to you but I thought you'd find it endearing for some reason like...
like people feel about Don Rickles or Mussolini.
It's not an excuse, it's just a reason.
Anyway, I'm sorry, okay.
I need a drink.
In a bad way.
There's a bar car here, they sell drinks.
Let's go.
No, doesn't that mean we have to walk in between the cars?
No, I can't do that while the train's moving.
- Oh, don't be such a pussy.
- Said the dick.
Besides, the world's at war right now, so I think we should...
We should take every little opportunity to put ourselves in harm's way.
Alleviate some of the guilt, you know?
No, no, there's all the scary noises that the train makes and what if I fell?
I don't have the best relationship with gravity.
Put your iPod on and play something calming that'll drown out the sound, and I'll hold your hand.
So you don't fall.
Come on.
Come on.
I won't let you go.
I promise.

Have you ever tried asking someone
"Where's my fucking money?" You ever done that?
You mean, at random, or when I'm actually owed money?
No, at random obviously.
Right, I don't know what I was thinking.
It's fun, you should try it.
Ask me.
Ask me where's my fucking money?
Where's my fucking money?
Where's my fucking money?
Oh, no, motherfucker.
Where's my fucking money!
If I don't get my fucking money right fucking now...
Where's my goddamn money, you motherfucker?
What the fuck?
Jesus.
That was really fun.
Wait.
It's just that...
Say what you were going to say, and then, after you say it maybe we should, like, not talk for a minute.
You know, like, let a whole minute pass by without saying something.
But go ahead and say what you were gonna say and then we can start right after that.
I'm really gonna miss you tomorrow.
So, wait, you're saying you dreamt this conversation?
A conversation that didn't take place until now?
I'm saying I dreamt a bunch of conversations, including this one which led me to come here, because it made me think about how much I regretted...
Do you regret meeting me, Dell?
No, of course not.
I'm glad we dated.
I needed to date you.
Before you, I only dated guys that looked good on paper.
Yeah.
Wait, what?
You were really, really smart, but also selfish, crass...
Not always in an entertaining way, mind you.
You hated your job and life and you were completely comfortable being miserable.
You're horrible on paper.
And I loved you.
Being with you made me realize it...
Doesn't have to look good on paper to feel good.
- What kind of sandwich...
- PB and J.
Of course.
- What's your favorite word?
- Comet.
- "Comet?"
- Right.
Not like "proliferate," "ensconce"
"kerfuffle," or "serendipity."
"Comet?" Like...
"comet?"
Yeah.
Exactly like that.
What about your least favorite word?
I don't strongly dislike any word.
I sort of have a love-hate relationship with the word
"fingerfuck," but that's technically two words and I like each one separately.
So, do you ever wish you could, like, control society for a couple of minutes?
Like make them all hate MTV or something?
I don't think MTV is as important as you think it is.
You're so wrong.
MTV is so manipulative.
It's like a drug which you get hooked on at age twelve that you can't wake up from until you're probably, like, thirty when you finally realize how awful it really was.
But by then, it's too late.
They've, like, won.
You've watched all their commercials during their week's sweep.
I believe it's "sweeps week."
You don't deserve me.
I can tell.
That's perfect.
I want someone I don't deserve.
You think you've won me.
I can't believe you think you've won me already.
Are you kidding?
You ditched a much prettier man to stay with me.
I've definitely won you.
You're so wrong, my friend.
Holy shit.
You are so easily amused.
Cause of the boots, huh?
Sarah's stupid idea.
Louis L'Amour is her favorite novelist, so, here we are.
You know I just realized.
I don't even know why we're here.
I don't even like Sarah.
Fire.
Just let me have this, and then we'll go.
What are you doing?
This feels like a dream...
I love it when you look out windows.
Sir...
Did you damage the bathroom about thirty minutes ago?
Well, I'm obviously going to tell you that I didn't.
- Sir.
- What?
I'm gonna have to ask you to get off at the next stop.
Don't let me find you on here after Chico.
Okay.
- You got me?
- Yes, sir.
I'm sorry.
I don't even wanna ask.
Looks like our little tryst is about to end.
Get off at Chico with me, please.
We can have an hour to two hour talk.
And then if you want, I'll get you another ticket to Portland.
An hour to two hour talk?
That's a long time, Dell.
Well, I'm not meeting anyone so.
Wait, what?
There's no... girl.
So, wha... what was this?
Just another one of your stupid mind games, Dell?
Why did you lie?
And what happened to your hand?
You're always hiding things!
I'm sitting somewhere else.
Now, listen, wait...
No, no.
Stop, stop, stop.
I'm sorry.
I lied because I thought it'd make it easier, okay?
- You thought it'd make it easier?
- Yeah.
You thought it'd make what easier exactly?
- Talking to you.
- Why would it make it easier?
Because I didn't think you'd talk to me if you knew I was trying to get you back.
So what was this?
Is this a plan to win me back?
Yes, it was.
It was a whim that turned into a plan.
How did you even know I was on this train?
Because I've...
I've...
I've stalked you.
You could've called, Dell.
- You haven't talked to me in a long time.
- I know.
You have my phone number, you have my e-mail but you haven't contacted me once, not once in months.
Just...
Look, I know a great public library in Chico where we can talk.
We can talk about all of this.
You wanna go to a public library to talk?
That seems counter-intuitive.
Well, they have a talking area.
You happen to know of a public library in Chico with a talking area?
Yeah.
First, answer my question.
How come you never proposed?
Come on, Kim, you broke up with me.
How come you didn't fight for me?
It felt like the end of days when you left.
I ate Ramen for months.
I had a huge sodium imbalance.
I barely got through it.
I didn't think I could do it again.
Felt like my fucking world was gonna blow.
So me leaving you constitutes your world blowing up?
Yes.
It does actually.
Next stop, Chico.
Please, come on.
I want you to do this.
Why wouldn't you want this forever?
I'd like for once to understand why you wouldn't want this always.
It's always as scary.
There's a finality to it.
I just don't ever want you to feel like a limitation.
Okay, let me go a different way with it.
Why are girls so scared of cockroaches?
Cause you think they're gonna hurt you even though they can't.
Just like I'm afraid "always" will hurt me.
- They're both irrational.
- False on so many fronts.
Why?
Girls are afraid of cockroaches because they're gross and they carry disease, proven by the fact that they were one of the biblical plagues.
Also, they also love to lay eggs in your vagina.
Secondly, it's not irrational to think that commitment can hurt you...
Because it can.
Know that when a steal a girl's twenties...
It's dangerous business, buster.
You're officially on notice, Mr. Pink Lighter.
- Duly noted, Mrs. Pink Lighter.
- Nope, can't call me that.
You don't want to marry me, remember?
I didn't say that.
Where's my phone?
Where's my phone?
Where's my fuckin' phone?
Why don't I call it?
Why are you acting like that?
- Like what?
- Uncomfortable.
In the two years we've known each other
I've rarely seen you uncomfortable.
I...
I'm not.
You are.
You're hiding something from me.
Ah, God, you just got too stoned, Kimberly
And I thought we were going after your last cigarette.
- What're you doing?
- What're you hiding?
- You know something?
- There's no "something."
You just got too high.
You best motherfucking believe there's a something.
There's always a something.
Okay?
This is not the first time I've felt that.
- Felt what?
- You...
Saying something like you've slipped.
I didn't slip...
Like a cartoon character on a banana peel.
You know what?
You're actually starting to freak me out.
There's nothing going on.
Well, it's about time you're freaked.
Okay.
I hate always feeling like the freak in this relationship!
Why're you doing this?
Because there's something you're not telling me.
Okay.
I know you, and I know when you get uncomfortable.
And it's so rare that I've formed an acute discomfort detector on you.
Now, are you gonna tell me what it is or are you going to force me to be late to my own annoying friend's Louis L'Amour goddamn western-themed wedding?
Kimberly, let's not do this.
This is paranoia.
Hey.
Kim.
Look at me.
Keep looking.
You're right.
You're right.
There is something I've been wanting to tell you.
In the dream, I told you I wanted to be with you.
I wanted you to leave Jack and to walk out the door with me.
Wow.
- Do you feel that?
- What?
Okay, calm down.
Maybe you just need some air.
Let's go up to the rooftop.
So, what else happens in this dream?
Do I...
Do I go with you?
All happily ever after and the like?
Or do I slap you and tell you to be gone.
I don't know, actually.
We were looking at each other and I went to kiss you and before our lips touched, I woke up.
What?
Maybe I never saved you that night we met.
Maybe you did die, hit by that car.
And this is just some afterlife fantasy playing out in your head.
- What?
- Something feels weird.
Remember how I used to love flipping the pillow over to feel the cold side?
Yeah.
That's what our relationship felt like.
Constant tossing and turning looking for that perfect balance.
Sometimes it was there, and other times...
I know, I know.
You always expected us to break up.
Why was that?
Is that because of your dumb five-minutes-from-now rule?
You know, after we stopped talking the five-minute rule started shrinking.
It went to four minutes, to three, then two, then one...
Let's go up to the rooftop.
Come on.
I thought my unconscious was trying to tell me something, you know.
By dreaming that dream a few nights ago.
Coming here, talking to you.
That might close the gap, that last minute.
Or...
Or none of this is really happening.
This could still be your dream.
♪ Dum dum dum ♪♪
Fuck!
What?
What happened?
Fuckin' bird carcass on my windshield!
What?
Okay.
Slow down, tell me what's going on.
I'm saying a fucking bird just committed suicide on my windshield!
What?
In the middle of our conversation?
What is our conversation have to do with anything?
It must mean something.
It must mean that the... that the...
Maybe the bird was commenting on our situation.
Commenting?
You think this is commentary?
Definitely, I mean, it's something, the universe cosmos, all that, via the bird, sent us a signal.
Yeah.
Okay.
I want you to listen to me very, very carefully.
Okay?
Okay, you're gonna be mean.
Aren't you?
On this already horrible call, you're gonna be mean on top of it.
You are very, very, very...
You know what?
I can't even say "very" enough so just imagine an infinite number of "verys." Okay?
Well, I don't have that kind of imagination.
I barely picture odd numbered things.
Well, freakin' try, okay?
Cause that number of "verys" precedes sick.
Sick.
S-I-C-K.
Told you you were gonna be mean.
And condescending, as if I didn't know how to spell sick.
You are not being a nice person right now!
So, I'm at the gun range.
This is a nightmare.
Sartre was right, "Hell is other people."
I should go, I've got my goggles on.
You did this on purpose, didn't you?
You wanted me to find out when I was three thousand miles away.
You were telegraphing all the signs like you were Samuel fucking Morse.
You wanted me to know.
That's the part that hurts the most.
Why would I want that?
Because maybe your feelings for him are real.
How long has it been going on?
- About a month.
- A month!
Oh shit!
I'm so sorry for interrupting the honeymoon period.
I hear those are the best parts of a relationship.
I-I'm gonna go, okay, I've got my goggles on...
Yes, I fucking heard you.
Enough with the goggles already!
Jesus Christ!
How're you gonna get off the phone and just go about your day after this, huh?
Because I don't think all of our conversations need to necessarily feel good.
They should feel bad then?
They should be whatever the conversation should...
I don't know.
Why are you analyzing this so much?
Oh, I'm not analyzing you yet.
I'm just giving you my initial gut reaction.
Can I please get off the phone with you and not feel like shit...
You hurt me!
You really hurt me this time, Kimberly.
I wanna break up with you.
I don't love you.
Dell, that's not what you want to say...
That is what I want to say actually.
I don't...
I don't love you, Kimberly.
Honestly, I don't know if I ever really did.
And you definitely didn't.
If you're capable of making choices that knowingly hurts the other person, that's not love.
Okay, you're mad, you're mad...
How can you say that?
Reality is I could have met any number of girls to be with for a few years.
That was your lie.
Alright?
Texting Jack behind my back.
It came when I least expected it.
I fell for it hook, line and sinker and it fucking hurts.
That was your lie.
- Bravo.
- Okay, fine.
You wanna hurt me?
You wanna be right?
Fine, go ahead.
Be right.
All I ever wanted was the truth.
No, no, you wanna be right.
No.
Truth is not what you're after.
Because if you wanted the truth, then you would have to accept the fact that I do...
Who is this?
I'm sorry, is this Dell?
- Who's this?
- Yes, hi.
This is Nancy.
I'm your mother's nurse.
We met a few times.
Yeah.
I'm really sorry to have to tell you this.
Your mother passed away.
What?
That's impossible.
She's been okay for years now.
Her cancer's been in remission.
She had a heart attack.
Heart attack?
Why?
Sometimes these things just happen.
This feels strange.
Not what I expected my train ride to feel like at all.
What were you expecting?
I was expecting to read that short story.
The Roald Dahl one?
You already read it though.
You know the ending.
Sometimes it's not about knowing the ending.
It can't be the same like it was the last time.
It has to be different or we'll wind up right where we started.
I know.
I know.
I promise you a change.
I promise, okay?
You know, I'm falling out of love with you, right?
Just shut up for a second, please.
What do you wanna tell me, Dell?
Kimberly...
I used to find it annoying when you said "so" all the time.
It bugged the shit out of me.
And I love it.
I love it now.
After we have sex and you shrug your shoulders and you say, "I'm here all week."
I love that.
I love that a single strand of your hair can fall so perfectly to the side, and you don't even know.
I love the little blue veins behind your eyes.
I love your eyes.
Knowing you goes down as easily the best thing that's ever happened to me.
Easily.
If I were a restaurant, you'd be my special but nobody could order you because I'd just want you to be mine, just all mine.
Not in the biblical, slavery-owning sense or, uh, the pimp-prostitute dynamic of,
"You be mine, bitch!" but... but, just in that...
You're my love.
You're my love.
But my favorite thing of all.
I like you because you like me.
I think that says a lot about how great you are as a person.
So, um...
Dell.
Believe me.
Believe me when I say...
You almost had me.
'Is that weird to imagine that one day' 'this will all be old to us?
'
This walk, us meeting.
It'll just be an old memory.
That sounds...
Sad.
Hey, I gotta ask you a really big question.
I don't know if you can handle it.
It's...
It's really big.
What?
Forget it.
It's stupid.
- What?
- Forget it.
It's a stupid joke.
You'd probably even figure it out by now.
- Why would I know the joke?
- Because I've already said it.
- When?
- Earlier in the conversation.
When?
Hey, come on.
I'm so confused!
Sometimes I wanna stop people on the streets...
Who?
- Anybody, from all walks of life.
On their way to work, to the gym, to school!
- I wanna stop them all, grab them like I'm grabbing you right now.
- Right now?
Right now.
I wanna look right into their eyes and I wanna ask them one simple question.
Where's my fucking money?
I think I'm going to fall in love with you too.
- Are you crying?
- Shut up.
There's still my theory that this is just part of that strange dream.
And so even if we do kiss, you'll just wake up and it'll all be over.
This can't be a dream.
What if it is?
What're you doing?
Something's wrong.
I know it, Kimberly, I know you.
You have circles under your eyes.
You were the type of girl that could sleep through wars.
And despite that, you're still looking so beautiful.
More beautiful than ever, in fact.
It's usually a sign you wanna remind the world that you're a sexual being because your man's not picking up the signal.
You've checked out of this relationship, haven't you?
You're not happy.
Also, you're listening to Roxette.
I know that means the beginning of the end.
And let's get real for a second about the ring, alright.
You're not having it sized.
I'm sure you had your ring-size burned into Jack's memory years ago.
Fuck, I still remember it, 4.5.
You didn't wear the ring because you didn't want me to see it.
Don't marry him, okay.
I want you back.
I know you want me back too.
That's why I'm here.
That's what you've been wanting to say to me this whole time...
- Dell.
- What?
I'm pregnant.
What?
Morning sickness has been keeping me up.
I just really love Roxette.
And I dressed this way not to announce to the world anything.
It was you.
I wanted to look good for you.
Because no matter how bad our relationship got
I wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for it.
Because I needed it.
I needed you in this life.
That's what I wanted to say.
I gotta...
I gotta sit down.
I'm sorry.
I'm not leaving Jack.
I love him.
Wow.
You're pregnant.
I didn't see that coming.
Do you know what it is yet?
Not yet.
Hoping it's a girl.
Uh, I almost proposed to you, you know?
When we were in that hotel room in Paris.
I even picked out the ring.
I had it with me.
I was about to give it to you, and then I took it and I flushed it down the toilet.
I keep replaying that moment over and over again in my head.
Why are you crying?
I'm just happy to see you.
And it's such a beautiful night.
I feel like I'm in the wrong world.
Cause I don't belong in a world where we don't end up together.
I don't.
There are parallel universes out there where this didn't happen.
Where I was with you, and you were with me.
And whatever universe that is that's the one where my heart lives in.
I wanted so badly to go back into that dream I had the other night.
I tried so hard... to go back to sleep.
You know, I never thought love was real.
I didn't.
And now I think life isn't real without it.
That sounds like a really bad greeting card...
Don't.
Don't make it a joke.
Truth?
I think you always believed in love.
This is so stupid.
So irrational.
Why am I so hell-bent on getting you back?
You fucking hate Pixar movies for crying out loud.
You still have an AOL account.
I don't wanna be with a person like that.
Why does it feel so impossible to let you go?
It's an addiction, you know.
That's all it is.
It's a biochemical addiction.
It's so stupid.
If you think about it relationships are all totally narcissistic.
Basically, you're just looking for someone who'll love you as much as you love yourself.
That's all it is.
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.
No, it's not.
No, it's not.
I don't know anything anymore.
But I know I do love you.
- Dell...
- Just give me a minute, okay.
Thisis notadream.
Thisisnotadream.
Okay.
Okay.
This is not a dream.
This is not a dream.
This is not a dream.
Not a dream.
How did I get here?
I don't know.
Somebody just transferred me here.
I don't wanna give you my information again.
I just told someone 5 times.
Can one of you behave like a real person, please?
I'm calling about..
Right, yes, I'm her son.
What kind of cancer are we talking about?
What are our options?
What about a liver transplant?
Why not?
Askabouther Child-Pugh score.
Trust me.
What'sher Child-Pugh score?
B. Uh..
Whatabouther bilirubin levels?
If they're low enough, they might consider yttrium-90.
Holdon.
Youhave really bad social skills.
Can you pretend to not listen to my conversation?
Nobody likes that guy.
Don't be that guy.
Eyes on the prize.
Yeah.
What about yttrium-90?
Her bilirubin levels are too high.
Okay, listen.
I'm gonna get on a flight in the morning.
Uh, so I should be at the hospital by 3.
Just have her call me tonight, so I know I'm wanted.
Thanks.
Fuck.
Thisisaboutyourmom?
Yeah.
Howlongaretheygivingher?
Idon'tknow,afewyears .
I'msosorry.
Yeah.
Whatareyoudoing?
Igottarollajointbefore the meteor shower starts.
Why?
We're about to watch a fucking meteor shower. "Why."
Oh, here.
That's for when you apply to college in a few years.
Use me as a reference.
You'rea postdoctoral scientist at Tristana Pharmaceuticals.
Yup.
Soyoualreadyknew--
Oh,thatcancerystuff, yeah, I did.
Anyway, I should be able to help you get you into a top ten pre-med in a few years.
Whatmakesyouthink I wanna go pre-med?
Well,otherthan the fact that you know what yttrium-90 is when most of your peers are still battling to crack the mysteries of parallel parking.
That'sjust because my mom --
Yourmomdiedof liver cancer.
Yeah, I know.
Your book bag has a cancer ribbon pinned to what could only be a picture of your mom.
She fits the age range.
And you guys have the same nose bridge.
Makes sense you wanting to become a doctor that saves people.
Right?
To make up for the doctor that couldn't save your mom.
Then, with time, those good intentions will fade and it'll become about the money like it always does.
And you'll become bitter, like everyone always becomes.
And then you die, probably from cancer.
You know, because that's ironic.
Istheresomethingwrong with you?
Probably,yeah.
Don'tworry, I'mworkingon it .
Ijustfiredmytherapist.
Shewassuchanidiotthough.
She diagnosed me with narcissistic personality disorder.
She said I'm under the grand delusion that I'm the smartest person in the world.
To which I responded, "What if I really am?"
You know?
Hey,overhere.
Watchout!
You okay?
You alright?
This- -thisdoesn't feel real.
What?
Ifeellikemylife just flashed before my eyes, you know, like in a movie where the main character dies in the beginning but he keeps going, not realizing he's dead.
Hey, what's that movie I'm talking about?
You know what I mean.
It's like, um..
What is it?
It's..
Oh,um,sure,uh, yeah.
Like, uh, Bruce Willis in "The Sixth Sense?"
Exactly.
Yeah.
Wait, no.
You know what, I never saw that.
Shit.
That's the twist that everyone was talking about?
Bruce Willis dies in the beginning of that.
That sucks.
Ah, I really wanted to see that.
Fuck.
I'msorry.
IguessIjust thought everyone had seen it.
No,don'tworry.
Now, I'm not that mad.
I mean I am, but I'll get over it.
That's a lie.
I'll probably harbor this for a few months at least and then, you know, we'll see.
See what happens.
Oh, that's cute.
Do you have an eating problem?
Oh, not like..
Sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.
Dude,comeon , you do realize my date isn't the one with the eating problem, right?
Oh.
Wha..
Uh-oh, Kimberly's annoyed.
Kimberly.
Kimberly.
Hey.
Howdoyoudothat ?
What?
Ihaven'tseenyou ina year when I was literally just thinking about you.
Oh,really?
Yeah.
Becauseof thatsong.
I was listening to it as I was walking here.
It reminded me of the hotel.
The one we stayed at for my friend's wedding in Paris.
Yeah,yeah,Paris.
City of Lights and pretension as I recall.
Wehadoneof our biggest fights.
Andthatwasyourfriend's wedding from Wisconsin, right?
What was her name, Lenora or Lee Anora?
Sarah?
Right.
Irememberthatwedding.
I remember that was the one where the DJ played that Montell Jordan song twice.
I remember, the first time we thought it was ironic then we realized he just liked the song.
Definitely our biggest fight.
The beginning of the end, really.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Look,It'slike the Beatles, right?
I mean, I liked them when I was 5.
But at a certain point, you just want something with a little more nuance, you know?
Don't get me wrong.
I could handle them a little better when they had Pete Best to ground them but past that, I don't know, they just got so pedestrian.
Doyoucomeherealot ?
DoI cometo thecemetery?
Ilikecemeteries.
You know, they're romantic.
Especially this one.
Soccerisby far the most elegant sport.
Yeah, I read somewhere it's gonna overtake football in America in the next 2 years.
Really?
2 years?
Afriendof mine described it.
Clock'sticking.
Heblogged, "Soccer's...soccer's chess on a field."
Doyouhaveavomit bag...vomit bags on you?
I'llsendyouthe link.
Iguesswe couldjust..
I'd hate to throw up on a grave.
Whydidn'tyoujustgoto the Griffith Park Observatory then to watch the meteor shower?
Oh,theyhaveassholes there too.
Trust me.
There're assholes all over the city
But rarely do you get to be next to one so spectacular.
Theonlyknockonhim though, I have to say, is that he's from New York.
I can't stand that place.
Seriously.
It's so overrated.
Why?
Becauseof all the bridges and the culture and the history they have?
Who needs it?
I'll take Orlando any day.
They got so many more T.G.I. Fridays.
DoI loveL.A.?
You know,Los Angeles is just more modern.
It has a certain relevancy about it
New York just doesn't have anymore.
Kimberly,I waswondering if I could have your number?
What?
Yourphonenumber?
Dude...she'swithme .
No.
Uh,yeah,sheis.
No,she'snot.
Not yet anyway.
At best, this is a first date.
And I'm shocked that that even happened.
I have nothing against you.
You might not be a bad guy.
Most likely you are but maybe not.
You're incredibly handsome and you were probably very handsome when you were a kid, too.
I think that explains your lack of substance and personality.
Only because nobody's ever really challenged you before.
So now as an adult you think everything you say means something, but it means nothing actually.
You don't know what you're talking about.
And it's really upsetting.
And I think she probably sees through that.
You're very pretty, but you're shallow beyond belief.
Anyway, can I have your number?
Okay,okay.
Whatareyoudoing?
Youjustsaid all that shit.
Yeah,butit wasjust an observation.
Andyouaskmygirl out in front of me?
Oh,shit.
Sorry, my mistake.
I see that now.
I shouldn't have done that.
She's way too beautiful.
What?
No.
I justshouldbe more of a realist.
I should know that I'm a C, maybe a C plus in the winter time when I can cover up my body more.
And even though you're a douche bag, you're still incredibly attractive.
So maybe it's only fair you two pair.
What?
Itrhymed.
She'sright,it rhymed.
Let's..
Can you just put me down?
This is embarrassing now for everyone.
Okay.
Comeon ,Josh.
The line's moving.
Let's -
- Let's just go.
Come on.
Oh,yeah..
Gottagetagoodseat .
Theonlythingwrongwith you is you're chicken shit.
That's all.
That'snottheonlyproblem.
Let'sgo.
Excuseme.
Excuse me.
Oneofmany.
Youokay?
Yeah.
I shouldn't have talked.
That's when I get into trouble.
I'm sorry I made fun of your sandwich bag.
I didn't mean to.
Actually, that's not true, I did.
Sorry.
I'm really nervous.
It'sokay.
I'm sorry he bothered you.
Iwasnotnervous because of him.
Okay.
Bye.
Sheisso ..
Beautiful.
Kim,comeon , thewedding'sin an hour.
Yougottagetready.
So...haveyouever dreamt about me?
Dreamtaboutyou?
Yeah.
You know, in the 700 plus days we've dated.
Youever dreamt about me?
So-
-Yeah,of course.
Oh,yeah?
Like, uh, sex dreams?
Atfirst,butthenwehad sex, and that went away.
Ha.
Isthathow you really wanna say that?
SoI wasallhot to trot for you or whatever in the beginning.
And now, you know, reality has set in.
But that's not what I meant.
I meant like..
a dream, like ambiguous depictions of what we are or were, or could be.
Stuff like that.
Canyoustopalready?
I got it.
Why,I oughta..
Oh,hey,whoo.
Put that down.
You're gonna hurt yourself.
What are you doing?
I'magiveyouwhatfor.
Oh,yeah?
Yeah.
You good?
Okay.
Okay.
That was fun.
Doesitbotheryou that you don't make me happy?
Alwayswiththejokes.
I'mserious.
Seriously?
Youwentfromsex dreams to not being happy?
False.
I wasn'ttalking about sex dreams, you were.
And secondly, I'm a girl, so yes, we non-sequitur.
That'sa littlecliched.
Iwantababy.
Pointtaken.
Seriously.
Don't you want a baby?
Someday,sure.
But let's burn that bridge when we get to it, okay?
See?
Not making me happy.
How do you do that?
How do you do that?
Oh,myGod.
She's beautiful.
She's beyond beautiful.
And she's real.
She seems funny, too.
And there's a hint of crazy, I can feel it.
Beautiful, crazy, and funny.
Jesus Christ.
She's perfect.
It's really annoying.
Really..
That'stwonearcollisions for you now in a row.
Well,atleast this one's nonfatal.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye.
Uh,yeah.
What the fuck was that?
Wait.
Wait.
What are we doing?
Are we in a chase scene now?
What are we doing?
Wait, just stop for a second.
SoI thoughtIsaw somebody, a friend of mine behind you coming over.
So that's why I turned around and waited.
So what's the big deal?
Itwasn'tbecause you were watching me?
Because it looked like you were kinda watching me.
No,itwasbecause of a friend that was behind you.
So they're not there now obviously.
Besides, you were being weird.
You were talking to yourself.
What were you saying anyway?
Yousay"so"alot.
It's really annoying.
So..
Are you trying to make this awkward now?
It feels awkward now.
Awkwardfeelsgoodtome.
Andawkwardfeels awkward to me.
That'sa littleon thenose, don't you think?
I'm not trying to fuck you.
If that's what you're worried about, I mean.
I'm not gonna ask you out because I don't believe in love.
I think all relationships deteriorate into hate indifference or..
Well, yeah, those two things.
Myparentshavebeentogether for 32 years.
And they're happily in love.
No,they'renot.
Yes,theyare.
No,they'renot.
If they haven't divorced by now probably means they've just surrendered to the fact that being apart isn't much better than being together.
You know, the lesser of two evils.
Trust me, it's like an emotional holocaust between your parents right now.
They probably have lukewarm feelings about you too.
I'm Dell, by the way.
So, no offense, but I have a-a thing about shaking hands.
Oh,myGod.
You are a little crazy.
That's great.
You'renotimpressingme.
Idisagree.
Youknow,youshouldstop trying to sound so smart all the time.
You just wind up sounding really dumb.
It'sjustIrealized why you date guys like that.
You have terrible taste in men because you're superficial.
You're fooling yourself in the hopes of finding something redeemable.
It's because of love.
That's your blind spot.
You gotta give up on that.
Wow.
Okay.
Well, I thank you for your insight, stranger but I actually believe love is real.
I'm gonna go now.
Wait.
Can I still get your..
Hello,boyfriend.
Hey.
Hey,listen,Roxette'son, and the good part is coming up.
Can I call you back?
Wait-wait,I justhaveto tell you something more important really quick.
You know that book I've been reading, "The Selfish Gene" by Richard Dawkins --
¶ Leave the winter on the ground ¶
There'sthisfascinatingpart I just read about memes.
He basically says that ideas are like genes that self-replicate and mutate like a cultural form of evolution --
¶ Touch me now I close my eyes -- ¶
Iwasthinkinghow that applies to us, you know?
The idea of us, how we've really mutated and evolved --
¶ And it's a hard winter's day -- ¶
Right?
becauseyouthink about it, we were just dumb, young kids when we first met.
And then we broke up, got back together, blah blah blah.
And now, we're this really mature, loving couple who's grown respect and admiration for each other.
You know what I mean?
Kimberly?
You hung up on me, didn't you?
¶ But it's over now ¶
¶ From the moment we touched ¶
¶ Until the time had run out ¶
¶ Yeah ¶¶
Well,maybeyoucould.
Well, because I'd like her to be at the best place.
Well, then maybe you can introduce me to the head guy at the cancer immunology lab.
Because I've taken an interest, that's all.
Yes,mom,Imeditated.
I meditate before every date, but it didn't help.
Face facts, no one thinks I'm special but you.
Well, I'm still technically on it.
But it's not working out, trust me.
He called himself a Bob Dylan song and then proceeded to call me a Britney Spears song.
I don't know what it means either, but it sounds insulting.
No,nothim.
Uh, the one with glasses, mustache.
Looks like a child trafficker.
Yeah, yeah, that's the one.
Well, if I..
I gotta go.
I gotta go.
CanI askyou a serious question?
Do you think I have terrible taste in men?
Okay, I'm back.
Uh-huh.
Well, I'm at-- Ihaveto talktoyou.
I'monthephone.
No,it'sreallyimportant.
Really important.
I'monthefriggin'phone.
Haveyouevercriedatoneof these things?
I was wondering.
Mom, I have to go.
Something weird is happening.
One of what things?
Thesemeteorshowerthings.
Cried?
Yeah,youknow,liketearsof joy, that kind of thing.
No.
I 'venevercried at one of these things.
NeitherhaveI. Ever, ever.
In fact, I don't understand people that do.
It's kind of bullshit, happy crying is, isn't it?
What are your thoughts on that?
SoI wason thephone.
So,yeah,youwere on the phone.
Sorry.
Was it important?
Moreimportant than your question?
Yes.
Yes.
Mymistake.
Sorry.
I'll never interrupt you again.
Thankyou.
Okay.
Well..
I should get back to my date.
He's probably --
ButI justwannakeep talking to you.
What?
Iwannakeeptalkingtoyou for multiple reasons.
I mean, you're beautiful, but it's more than that.
I promise.
That'sverynice, but I should go.
Maybe I'll see you in the winter when you're a C plus.
See?
I knewit .
Iknewyou were superficial.
I told you.
Theonlyreasonthat you're talking to me is because you think I'm hot.
Yeah,buttheonlyreason why you won't is because you think I'm not.
Fine.
Giveme areason why I should?
Iwassaying, "Don't miss her."
Earlier, when you saw me talking to myself.
I was saying, "Don't miss her."
I'm always so afraid I'm gonna miss the important things in life.
Something about you has given me a heightened curiosity to know you better.
And that is a near impossible feat when it comes to me because I hate getting to know people.
But I can tell you're not like the others.
Whatothers?
People.
People?
You can tell I'm not a person?
Yeah,you'renotphony like them.
Also, I didn't say you were hot.
I said you are beautiful.
When is this dumb thing gonna happen?
It'sa beautifulnight though.
What?
Ineverknowwhatthat means when people say that it's a beautiful night?
What does it mean?
So...well,tome means it's comfortable, familiar..
...yet deeply moving.
Right,no-
- Ifeelyou like, uh, like getting stoned and listening to Steely Dan.
No.
Nothing at all like that.
No-
-I know.
More like..
Yeah, like..
...floating down a serene lake in a rowboat when the sun is setting or rising -- or when the sun is ...being a part of nature.
Stopspeaking.
Okay.
It'sbeautifulwhen the weather is not hot or cold.
Kinda like you don't notice it.
Kinda like it's perfect because everything is so balanced.
You don't even feel it.
And while you're feeling that non-feeling you look up in the sky and you almost think that's why.
Because how everything is right now, all the stars and planets and us and the ground, and the cells and molecules right now...is exactly the reason why now is comfortable.
You'rea nowperson.
True.
Yeah,see,I'ma 5-minutes-from-now person.
Because 5 minutes from now, a gust of wind could come in and blow H1N1 in everyone's eyes.
Right.
Except that's highly unlikely.
Or5 minutesfromnow , an earthquake could erupt and swallow us all whole.
Right.
Exceptthat..
No, shit, that could actually happen.
Yeah.
Thepointis I'm way too anxious about what could happen 5 minutes from now to be content with now.
Can't do it.
Whatifsomethinggood happens 5 minutes from now?
Can't that happen?
No.
Whatdidyouthink was gonna happen 5 minutes before you met me?
I'mjustreallyparanoid I'm gonna miss it.
I miss things a lot.
Idon'tcareif I miss it because --
You'rea nowperson.
Got it.
Soanotherweirdthing.
I don't mind your pessimism as much as I usually mind pessimism.
That'sgreat.
Ihatepeople who think I'm too negative.
Also,I likeyourhat .
Yeah,I 'mprobablygonna fall in love with you.
Wow.
That'sit?
Whatwereyouhopingfor?
I'm going to fall in love with you, too?
No,but..
Well, yeah.
Soallthatstuffaboutnot believing in relationships --
Oh,that'sjust a pick-up line.
Do we have a deal then?
'Cause you said you believe in love.
I don't.
Let's put it to the test.
Date each other.
Me and you.
In a relationship.
Let's do it.
WhythehellamI shaking your hand?
I should be scared to death of who you are as a person.
Instead, I'm scared to death of weddings.
Death.
Literally.
I'd probably have a coronary right as I'm walking up the aisle.
Oh,God,pleaseinviteme to your wedding.
I would love to see that.
Well,that'smorbid and telling.
Yeah,well,if snufffilms were readily available
I'd probably watch them, not gonna lie.
Is that a deal breaker for you?
No,becauseforsomereason
I still happen to be in love with you.
No, it's because you didn't think that you'd be the one marrying me.
Youdon'tsmokeweed.
What are you doing?
Don't do that.
Sodo youstilllove me?
Itellyouall the time, if you died right now
I'd visit your grave every single day.
Not every day, that's crazy.
Thatdoesn'tanswer thequestion.
Ofcourse,Iloveyou.
Itneversoundsreal whenyousayit.
Likeitdoesn'texist.
So what are you doing here?
Goingupnorth.
Whywouldyoudothat ?
Idon'tknow.
Youdon'tknow?
I'm...
I'mkidding.
I'm going to meet someone.
Soright,okay.
How's your mom doing?
She'sactuallyfine.
I can't believe I haven't talked to you this long.
Yeah, turns out her doctors are huge idiots.
So I kinda took matters in my own hand.
I figured out a way to dose her with that experimental drug we've been developing in our lab.
Wait.
Are you allowed to do that?
No.
Wasn'tthat extremely dangerous?
Yeah.
Oh,yeah.
She'sfinenow?
Yeah,completely.
She's in remission.
So..
Dell,that'sgreat.
Yeah.
Imean,otherthanthe totally-unethical-recklessly- risking-your-mom's-life part.
That's...that's, You -- you saved her.
Yeah,I guess.
We should probably keep that between us...by the way
Because there's a good chance what I did was illegal...ish.
Right.
Oh.
Allaboard.
Right.
We should probably..
Okay,right.
Well, still, wow.
I can't believe you're curing cancer now.
Does that mean you've stopped hating people?
Notatall.
Kill Zelda Fitzgerald.
Right?
Whoisthat?
Really?
Idon'tknowwho thatis.
F.ScottFitzgerald's annoying...wife.
Oh,really?
Yeah.
Oh.
I'ddefinitelymarry Rita Hayworth.
Greathair.
Hair,right.
Guys love her hair.
I definitely have to shit out of this one.
OlgaKordinstitch?
Who is that?
Idon'tknow.
I'vejust always wanted to fuck an Olga.
Iwoulddefinitely marry Tupac.
KimberlyShakur.
It's got a good ring to it.
Iwoulddefinitely "F" Edward R. Murrow.
I picture him starting up sex with
"Good night, and good luck."
I'd probably laugh so much that I'd have an orgasm right then and there.
From the laughter, you know?
Iliedaboutnot seeing "The Sixth Sense."
OfcourseIsaw it.
Everybody saw it.
It's amazing.
Who didn't see "The Sixth Sense?"
Whywouldyoulie aboutthat ?
Ireadin awoman'smagazine that every relationship whether it be short term, or long term there's usually, like, one big lie relative to that relationship and I just..
I wanted to get mine over with, I guess.
Whywouldyouwanttoget a jump start on the lying?
Because--
Becauseoffiveminutes from now.
Well,yeah...
You'reassumingthat we're in a relationship or going to be when I'm still technically on a date with someone else.
Which I should probably be getting back to.
by the way.
Whataboutthehandshake?
We shook hands.
You can't do that.
Iwasleadingyou on.
That'sreallyfuckedup.
That'sthebusiness.
Well,whatabout a friendship?
Actually, what am I talking about?
I definitely don't want to be friends with you.
Iwasraped.
Inhigh school.
Bythequarterback...
of the football team.
Jesus.
Iknow.
Thatisaterriblelie.
Hey!
Howdo youknow that's a lie?
Youwereraped in high school by the quarterback of the football team?
I don't think after-school specials are that cliched.
You couldn't have gone with, like, a cornerback or defensive end or something?
Well,I wasjusttrying to get mine over with.
- Get what over who?
- My lie to you.
- You can't.
- Why can't?
BecauseI sawit coming, because we just talked about it.
You'vegotto waituntil I'm in a completely vulnerable position where I'd really fall for it.
Thatsoundsreallydangerous.
Oh,yeah, that's the problem with relationships.
Danger?
- Or worse.
- Worse?
Youcouldchange the other person.
You'rea very broken man, Dell.
Intheory.
Speaking of broken men, your goateed Philistine 'is sashaying towards us.'
- Run!
- What?
- Run!
- What?
'Run!
'
Well,that'ssettled.
Wanna hit?
Noway.
It hasaweird effect on me.
For some reason, when I'm high, I think people can't hear me and I start speaking really loudly.
Do you remember memorizing phone numbers?
I don't remember the last time I memorized a phone number.
Idon'teither,actually.
Remember checking the newspaper for movie showtimes?
Remember that?
Orwritingpeoplethosenotes in those, like, folded-up triangles and then putting them in their lockers.
Do you think kids still do that?
As opposed to just e-mails or texts?
Noway.
It 'sall about e-mails and texts with those goddamn hugs and kisses.
I hate those things.
Whenever anybody e-mails me hugs and kisses
I wanna just e-mail them back oral and penetration.
Areweold?
Are we talking like old people?
Are we on the verge of joining the sweatpants culture?
Was I just saying something?
What?
Was I?
Givemethat.
- Why?
- Give me that.
Okay, that's it for you.
I think you should start drinking some coffee.
Okay?
See,that'swhyIhate time .
IbelieveIwantto have sex with you now.
IbelieveIshare in that belief.
Hey,uh,uh -
- Okay.
We gotta get ready.
Come on.
What the F?
I thought we were gonna make it!
Iknow,butwegottago,Kim.
Really.
What's that?
What is that?
'You ordered Chinese food?
Who orders Chinese food in Paris?
'
Kim, they're going to have dinner at the wedding, you know?
'The wedding that we're supposed to go to in half an hour.'
'And you just ate lunch.
You're not full?
'
Whatdoesthat have to do with anything?
Oh,Jesus.
This is the pot talking.
You shouldn't have smoked.
I knew it.
You gotta get ready.
What are you doing?
You made me promise to get you down there on time no matter what.
You warned me you would do this.
See,thisis whyIhate time .
I can't enjoy my sesame chicken because of it.
Kim.
'WishI couldjuststopit or something.'
Or at least just make it pause when needed, like now.
Or better yet, just get rid of it altogether.
Youwannagetrid oftime ?
How would you do that?
'Youknowhowthere's time-based art?
'
Movies, music, plays, it's all time-based art.
There's a beginning, and a middle and an end.
You have to see it from the beginning to the end.
You're restrained to that timeline..
'That way of experiencing it.'
But then there's paintings.
No beginning, no middle, no end.
You see what you want to see when you want to see it.
No restrictions, it's just there.
Okay,soyouwantlife tobe a painting?
Great.
What?
Thanks.
So,doyouknowyou really love me?
So, what's in your pocket?
Mywallet.
It's stuffed with our saved movie ticket stubs because I'm a romantic like that.
Can you please get ready?
Shhh!
Can'tyousee , I'm trying to touch my toes?
Ireallydon'twant to be that couple that's always late for things.
Can we please not be that couple?
At least for the tenure of our relationship?
Please.
Youdidit again!
What?
What, I'm just saying I want us to respect time.
'Notthat.'
Okay,whatthen?
Whatdid I do that I did twice now and still not know?
Yousaid"thetenure of our relationship."
You keep speaking about our relationship as if it's ending.
Okay.
Youseehow this relates to the time thing?
Why don't you take your own advice and instead of seeing a beginning, middle, and end, just see it as a painting.
Kimberly!
What are you doing?
We're going to be late!
And I'm gonna somehow get blamed for it, I know it.
What are you reading?
RoaldDahlshortstories.
So, is it about a girl?
Is it about a new girl you're going up north?
A new girlfriend you're not telling me because you think it'll make it awkward --
Yeah.
So,right.
Okay.
New girl.
IloveRoaldDahl.
He's the best.
Which one are you reading?
And are you sleeping with anyone?
TheoneaboutHitler.
And yes.
Shit.
I didn't know he wrote one about Hitler.
Uh...kindof.
It's about this doctor that saves this woman's life.
'She's on the verge of death through the whole delivery.'
And this doctor is so determined to save this woman's life and the life of her unborn child, right?
But, it turns out that the child is Hitler.
Okay,uh..
Did you just give away the ending?
HowwasIsupposedtotell you what the story was about without giving away the ending?
Whatareyoutalkingabout?
Just say..
It's a story about a doctor who saves a woman from a potentially fatal pregnancy?
Becausethat'swhat the story is about.
Itis.
False,birdbrain.
Thatisnot what the story is about.
It's about the irony that the baby's Hitler.
- Okay, you're mad.
- I'm not mad.
- You're mad 'cause of the girl.
- I'm seeing a guy.
Jack.
You'reseeingaJack?
'He'sanexecutiveatMTV. '
Looks like a cross between Salvador Dali and Dwayne Wayne from "A Different World," which is hot.
That'sa weirdcombination.
Igottago to thebathroom really quick.
Well, that...fucking..
...hurt.
What?
Youhungup on me .
What happened?
Because.
Okay,yourealizethat'snot an answer to my question, right?
Whatisit thatIcan help you with, sir?
Idon'tknow.
HaveItoldyou how much New York reminds of why I hate L.A. so much?
No,pleasedo ,because the New Yorker who opines the inferiorities of Los Angeles is bursting with originality.
'I'mserious,Kimberly' we gotta move here, it is the fucking best.
It's enough already with L.A.
It's like a mix of moral nihilism and Disneyland.
Soareyou.
Hey,didItellyoutheproof of concept on our drug passed with flying colors?
There's actually a bidding war between a few pharmas right now.
Looks like we could be licensing it for close to 25 million.
Money for soul seems like --
Anevenswap,yes ,it'snot like I'm not happy for you but you did already tell me this all this morning, remember?
- Did I really?
- Uh-huh.
Ohshit,my short-term memory must be shot.
What with the smoking pot and whatnot.
I'myournewsecond-term girlfriend, man aren't you supposed to be, like, impressing me still?
Yoursecond-termboyfriend just told you he made his bosses close to 25 million dollars today.
I'mnotmaterialistic.
Iknowthat, but 25 million dollars sort of, I don't know, makes that sound retarded.
Okay,seeingas there'sno new information in this call
I am going to go.
I'm almost at the gun range.
Hey,don'tyouthink it's cute that you own a gun card and I own a pot card?
'Nowyousoundretarded.'
Listen,weshouldprobably stop saying retarded.
I'm starting to feel like an asshole.
Oh,isthatjust now starting?
What'sgoingon ?
You sound off.
You'reoff.
'No,no,no ,I'mserious.'
'Your cadence is all over the place.'
You sound a little like Miss Teschmacher when she betrayed Lex Luthor.
Something's wrong, I can tell.
What's going on?
Oh,God, this is gonna blow.
What'sgoingon ?
Oh, shit, this is bad, isn't it?
This is like infidelity bad.
I definitely heard a silence just now!
What is going on?
!
Youokay?
Yeah,youokay?
So...it'sbeenawhile.
Yup.
I'mgladyou'refinallyhere .
Yeah,metoo.
I'vebeentryingtogeta hold of you for a long time now.
Do you want a tour of the place?
No.
Oh,okay.
Seriously?
Oh,yeah.
Youknow I don't care about stupid shit like that.
'Right,sorry, I've adjusted to normal people' so your presence is gonna take some realignment.
Youmoving?
Uh,no,kind--kind of.
Um, do you want anything, by the way?
Like, uh..
Iwantto talk.
What?
Nothing,forasecondI..
I forgot what you looked like.
Fortherecord,I'venever forgotten what you looked like.
Okay,chillout,okay.
I didn't sleep with anyone!
Okay,didyousee and /or touch another man's penis in any way?
'Really?
Outof allthe things you want to know' 'this is what you wanna ask me the most?
'
Whatkindaquestionisthat .
Of course that's what I want to know the most!
No.
Penises were not involved.
Wereyourboobs and/or vagina --
No.
Itwastexts.
That's all it was.
Ishouldneverhavegone against my own advice.
I should always be the better looking one in the relationship but I just sort of hit an impasse on that.
Honestly,gosh,Dell,doyou really think that that --
'Whowasit ?
'
Itwasmy in-between ex...
Jack.
Jack,theMTVexec?
Are you fucking serious?
I thought you hated MTV!
Isn't he short?
He'snottall.
Wha..
Areyouseriously defending him?
You can't call him short, you have to go with "not tall?"
Jesus, you like him?
Why the fuck are you being 'so sangfroid over this shit?
'
'You're being way too easy on yourself!
'
You should know I'm standing in the middle of a monsoon right now.
Well...so,maybeIshould let you go then?
Why?
BecauseI'mstanding in the middle of a monsoon?
No,becauseyou-- Yes, because you're standing in the middle of a monsoon!
Um...
Are you okay?
What are you staring at?
'Oh, my thesis.'
'That reminds me.
I've been keeping articles about you.'
'They said that your drug led to major breakthroughs' 'in cancer treatment.
It's amazing, Dell.'
Your mom, especially, must be proud.
- That's me and --
- Jack.
How long have you guys been engaged?
So...whatareyou talking about?
You'veboxedup a lot of old kitchen appliances over there which means you've either declared a fatwa on General Electric or you're wedding registering the fuck out of your friends and family.
You've been fidgeting with your ring finger non-stop.
You're also giving me that look like you're trying to think of a lie real quick.
Imightbeat the shit out of you.
The wedding's in a few weeks.
Questionis, where's the ring?
It'sgettingsized.
Huh?
Question number two, why didn't you tell me?
Iwasgoingtotell you before you did your whole annoying MacGyver thing.
Idon'tthinkthat'sthe reference you're looking for.
Does Jack even know I'm here?
Trustme,he knows you're here.
Whatdoesthatmean?
Why did you scoff?
Whatscoff?
Ididn'tscoff.
Youscoffed.
You guys fought about me coming.
I'm actually kind of flattered, didn't know yours truly could threaten the evil prince of the MTV generation.
Firstofall, Jack's leaving MTV.
His article in Esquire was optioned by George Clooney.
Yeah,well,Iwon myfantasy baseball league last year.
Let'snottalk about Jack, okay?
I'mhappyto not talk about Jack.
What's the smoking rule in here?
Is he making a face?
Is that..
That's just how he looks.
So, I had a very vivid dream the other night about us.
Avividdream?
Whatwas it about, this vivid dream?
Itwasadreamofmemories.
'Uh,conversations thatwe'vehad.'
'Isavedyourlife.'
You owe the person that saved you, don't you think?
You had a dream that was really a series of memories of conversations we've had?
Yeah,don'thurtyourself, it's not that complicated.
'Cause to the brain, there's no difference between reality and dreams.
They were just memories of us over the years.
What if I don't subscribe to a culture of indentured servitude?
Youcan'tunsubscribe.
It's a thing of nature it's here to stay.
Theyweavedin andout of each other like those M.C. Escher drawings.
So, one second I'd be on that train that time we got back together after our first breakup another second I was on the phone in New York.
The last time we ever talked to each other.
But they blended together like a..
'Painting?
'
I saved your life.
If it weren't for me, you would have been run over by that car.
'You would have been splat' just like my timeless life painting thing.
Andtheywereall real..
...but there was one moment in the dream that was, um..
Well, it -- it -- it was one we never had, it was the only one.
'Whatwasit about?
This made-up moment?
'
It'sgonnasoundweird, but it was us talking after not having talked for however long.
'So,wait,I'mconfused.
It was --'
Thismoment.
Thismoment that we're having right now.
So me coming over, seeing your apartment, your life with Jack and reconnecting..
Oh, God, I feel sick.
I blame L.A. for this.
This is what happens when you fall in love in Los Angeles.
Fuck!
So, what is this?
Are you breaking up with me?
'Idon'twantto, no. '
Butyoulike this Jack guy, right?
Do you realize Jack Tripper was one of my favorite characters in all of fiction and you've forever ruined his good name?
Shit!
Can I..
Shit, I can't even order a Jack and Coke anymore!
A vodka soda!
A vodka soda?
My life is ruined!
Okay.
Weshouldjust get off the phone, okay.
You're mad, and any words we exchange now are gonna be bleak at best --
I can't believe this.
You used to never want to get off the phone.
No,I usedto wanttogetoff the phone, I just used to not.
Andnowyoucan 'twait to get off the phone.
Idon'tevenknowwhat we're fighting about anymore, okay.'
If you wanna yell at me about Jack, fine, but I'm too tired for another one of your meta arguments.
Idon'tdeserve to be treated like this.
'I thought you were supposed to be my indentured servant?
'
'Whatever happened to that, huh?
'
So,whatareyou talking about right now?
'I'mtalkingaboutthat-that prescription to life thing.'
Right,exceptit 's subscription to nature.
Whatever.
No,youhavethisbackwards, kid, I saved your life.
'ButthenIsavedyour life .'
When were on the train, we ran into each other, and we got back together.
Youmean,whenyou stalked and followed me onto the train?
'Isavedyourlifebecause you got off at Chico.'
'You weren't supposed to get off at Chico.'
You were supposed to go on to Portland, but because of me you got off at Chico instead and you weren't on the train when it derailed.
You could have died.
'Noonedied,Dell.'
Thepointremains--
No,that'snot the same, okay.
You would absolutely have died had I not saved you.
Plus, I saw that car coming.
I knew it was going to hit you, and I saved you.
I knowingly saved you.
Yeah,well,that'sstarting to feel like a minus, not a plus.
Bethatas it may,you didn't know you were saving me.
You were just trying to get back in my pants.
No!
I wastrying to get you back!
Which just happens to include getting into your pants.
Soyourswasasinister doing, mine was pure altruism.
ButI knowingly saved you too.
Wejustwentoverthis , pothead --
Youweresupposedtogetoff at Portland to meet Jack but I knowingly saved you from him.
Except I didn't, did I?
Fuck!
I should have told you I loved you more.
When we were together, I mean.
'I was also such a dick to you' but I thought you'd find it endearing for some reason like -- like people feel about Don Rickles or Mussolini.
It's not an excuse, it's just a reason.
Anyway, I'm sorry, okay.
Ineedadrink.
In a bad way.
There'sa barcarhere, they sell drinks.
Let's go.
No,doesn'tthatmeanwehave to walk in between the cars?
No,I can'tdo that while the train's moving.
Oh,don'tbe suchapussy.
Saidthedick.
Besides,theworld's at war right now, so I think we should --
We should take every little opportunity to put ourselves in harm's way.
Alleviate some of the guilt, you know?
No,no,there'sall the scary noises that the train makes and what if I fell?
I don't have the best relationship with gravity.
PutyouriPodon and play something calming that'll drown out the sound, and I'll hold your hand.
so you don't fall.
Come on.
Come on.
I won't let you go.
I promise.

Have you ever tried asking someone
"Where's my fucking money?" You ever done that?
Youmean,at random, or when I'm actually owed money?
No,atrandomobviously.
Right,I don'tknow what I was thinking.
It'sfun,youshould try it.
Ask me.
Ask me where's my fucking money?
Where'smyfuckingmoney?
Where'smyfuckingmoney?
Oh,no,motherfucker.
Where's my fucking money!
IfI don'tgetmyfucking money right fucking now --
Where'smygoddamnmoney, you motherfucker?
Whatthefuck?
Jesus.
Thatwasreallyfun .
Wait.
It's just that..
Say what you were going to say, and then, after you say it maybe we should, like, not talk for a minute.
You know, like, let a whole minute pass by without saying something.
But go ahead and say what you were gonna say and then we can start right after that.
I'mreallygonna miss you tomorrow.
So,wait,you'resayingyou dreamt this conversation?
A conversation that didn't take place until now?
I'msayingIdreamt a bunch of conversations, including this one which led me to come here, because it made me think about how much I regretted..
Doyouregret meeting me, Dell?
No,ofcoursenot .
I'mgladwe dated.
I needed to date you.
Before you, I only dated guys that looked good on paper.
Yeah.
Wait, what?
Youwerereally, really smart, but also selfish, crass..
not always in an entertaining way, mind you.
You hated your job and life and you were completely comfortable being miserable.
You're horrible on paper.
And I loved you.
Being with you made me realize it..
...doesn't have to look good on paper to feel good.
- What kind of sandwich --
- PB and J.
Of course.
- What's your favorite word?
- Comet.
- "Comet?"
- Right.
Notlike "proliferate," "ensconce"
"kerfuffle," or "serendipity."
"Comet?" Like..
..."comet?"
Yeah.
Exactlylikethat.
Whataboutyour least favorite word?
Idon'tstrongly dislike any word.
I sort of have a love-hate relationship with the word
"fingerfuck," but that's technically two words and I like each one separately.
So,doyoueverwish you could, like, control society for a couple of minutes?
Like make them all hate MTV or something?
Idon'tthinkMTV isas important as you think it is.
You'resowrong.
MTV is so manipulative.
It's like a drug which you get hooked on at age twelve that you can't wake up from until you're probably, like, thirty when you finally realize how awful it really was.
But by then, it's too late.
They've, like, won.
You've watched all their commercials during their week's sweep.
Ibelieveit 's"sweepsweek."
Youdon'tdeserveme.
I can tell.
That'sperfect.
I want someone I don't deserve.
You think you've won me.
I can't believe you think you've won me already.
Areyoukidding?
You ditched a much prettier man to stay with me.
I've definitely won you.
You'resowrong, my friend.
Holyshit.
Youareso easilyamused.
'Cause of the boots, huh?
Sarah's stupid idea.
Louis L'Amour is her favorite novelist, so, here we are.
You know I just realized.
I don't even know why we're here.
I don't even like Sarah.
Fire.
Just let me have this, and then we'll go.
What are you doing?
This feels like a dream...
Iloveit when you look out windows.
Sir..
...did you damage the bathroom about thirty minutes ago?
Well,I 'mobviouslygoing to tell you that I didn't.
Sir.
What?
I'mgonnahavetoaskyou to get off at the next stop.
Don't let me find you on here after Chico.
Okay.
Yougotme ?
Yes,sir.
I'msorry.
Idon'tevenwannaask.
Looks like our little tryst is about to end.
Getoffat Chicowithme, please.
We can have an hour to two hour talk.
And then if you want, I'll get you another ticket to Portland.
Anhourto twohourtalk ?
That's a long time, Dell.
Well,I 'mnot meeting anyone so.
Wait,what?
There'sno...girl.
So,wha-- whatwas this?
Just another one of your stupid mind games, Dell?
Why did you lie?
And what happened to your hand?
You're always hiding things!
I'm sitting somewhere else.
Now,listen,wait-- No, no.
Stop, stop, stop.
I'm sorry.
I lied because I thought it'd make it easier, okay?
Youthoughtit 'd make it easier?
Yeah.
Youthoughtit 'dmake what easier exactly?
Talkingtoyou.
Whywouldit makeiteasier?
BecauseI didn'tthink you'd talk to me if you knew I was trying to get you back.
Sowhatwasthis?
Is this a plan to win me back?
Yes,itwas.
Itwasa whim that turned into a plan.
Howdidyouevenknow I was on this train?
BecauseI 've-
-I 've- - I've stalked you.
Youcould'vecalled,Dell.
You haven't talked to me in a long time.
Iknow.
Youhavemy phonenumber, you have my e-mail but you haven't contacted me once, not once in months.
Just-
-Look,Iknowagreat public library in Chico where we can talk.
We can talk about all of this.
Youwannago to a public library to talk?
Thatseemscounter-intuitive.
Well,theyhave a talking area.
Youhappento know of a public library in Chico with a talking area?
Yeah.
First,answermy question.
How come you never proposed?
Comeon,Kim, you broke up with me.
Howcomeyoudidn't fight for me?
Itfeltlikethe end of days when you left.
I ate Ramen for months.
I had a huge sodium imbalance.
I barely got through it.
I didn't think I could do it again.
Felt like my fucking world was gonna blow.
Someleavingyou constitutes your world blowing up?
Yes.
Itdoesactually.
'Next stop, Chico.'
Please,comeon .
Iwantyoutodothis.
Whywouldn't you want this forever?
I'd like for once to understand why you wouldn't want this always.
It'salwaysas scary.
There's a finality to it.
I just don't ever want you to feel like a limitation.
Okay, let me go a different way with it.
Why are girls so scared of cockroaches?
'Cause you think they're gonna hurt you even though they can't.
Just like I'm afraid "always" will hurt me.
They'rebothirrational.
Falseonso manyfronts.
Why?
Girlsareafraid of cockroaches because they're gross and they carry disease, proven by the fact that they were one of the biblical plagues.
Also, they also love to lay eggs in your vagina.
Secondly, it's not irrational to think that commitment can hurt you..
...because it can.
Know that when a steal a girl's twenties..
...it's dangerous business, buster.
You're officially on notice, Mr. Pink Lighter.
Dulynoted, Mrs. Pink Lighter.
Nope,can'tcallmethat .
You don't want to marry me, remember?
Ididn'tsaythat.
Where'smyphone?
Where's my phone?
Where's my fuckin' phone?
Whydon'tIcallit?
Whyareyou acting like that?
Likewhat?
Uncomfortable.
In the two years we've known each other
I've rarely seen you uncomfortable.
'I-
-I 'mnot.'
Youare.
You're hiding something from me.
'Ah,God,youjust got too stoned, Kimberly'
'And I thought we were going after your last cigarette.'
'What'reyoudoing?
' What'reyouhiding?
Youknowsomething?
'There'sno"something."'
'You just got too high.'
Youbestmotherfucking believe there's a something.
There's always a something.
Okay?
This is not the first time I've felt that.
'Feltwhat?
' You..
...saying something like you've slipped.
'Ididn'tslip--'
Likea cartooncharacter on a banana peel.
'Youknowwhat?
You 're actually starting to freak me out.
There's nothing going on.'
Well,it'sabout time you're freaked.
Okay.
I hate always feeling like the freak in this relationship!
'Why'reyoudoingthis?
'
Becausethere'ssomething you're not telling me.
Okay.
I know you, and I know when you get uncomfortable.
And it's so rare that I've formed an acute discomfort detector on you.
Now, are you gonna tell me what it is or are you going to force me to be late to my own annoying friend's Louis L'Amour goddamn western-themed wedding?
Kimberly,let'snotdothis .
This is paranoia.
Hey.
Kim.
Look at me.
Keep looking.
You're right.
You're right.
There is something I've been wanting to tell you.
In the dream, I told you I wanted to be with you.
I wanted you to leave Jack and to walk out the door with me.
Wow.
Doyoufeelthat?
What?
'Okay, calm down.
Maybe you just need some air.'
'Let's go up to the rooftop.'
So, what else happens in this dream?
Do I..
Do I go with you?
All happily ever after and the like?
Or do I slap you and tell you to be gone.
Idon'tknow,actually.
We were looking at each other and I went to kiss you and before our lips touched, I woke up.
'What?
'
'MaybeI neversavedyou that night we met.'
'Maybe you did die, hit by that car.'
And this is just some afterlife fantasy playing out in your head.
What?
Somethingfeelsweird.
RememberhowIusedtolove flipping the pillow over to feel the cold side?
Yeah.
That'swhatour relationship felt like.
Constant tossing and turning looking for that perfect balance.
Sometimes it was there, and other times --
Iknow,Iknow.
Youalwaysexpected us to break up.
Why was that?
Is that because of your dumb five-minutes-from-now rule?
Youknow,after we stopped talking the five-minute rule started shrinking.
It went to four minutes, to three, then two, then one..
Let'sgoup to the rooftop.
Come on.
Ithoughtmy unconsciouswas trying to tell me something, you know.
By dreaming that dream a few nights ago.
Coming here, talking to you.
That might close the gap, that last minute.
Or..
Or none of this is really happening.
This could still be your dream.
¶ Dum dum dum ¶¶
Fuck!
What?
Whathappened?
'Fuckin'birdcarcass on my windshield!
'
What?
Okay.
Slowdown, tell me what's going on.
I'msaying a fucking bird just committed suicide on my windshield!
'What?
Inthemiddle of our conversation?
'
Whatisourconversation have to do with anything?
Itmustmeansomething.
It must mean that the -- that the..
Maybe the bird was commenting on our situation.
Commenting?
You think this is commentary?
Definitely,I mean, it's something, the universe cosmos, all that, via the bird, sent us a signal.
Yeah.
Okay.
I want you to listen to me very, very carefully.
Okay?
Okay,you'regonnabemean .
aren't you?
On this already horrible call, you're gonna be mean on top of it.
'Youarevery,very,very ..'
You know what?
I can't even say "very" enough so just imagine an infinite number of "verys." Okay?
Well,I don'thave that kind of imagination.
I barely picture odd numbered things.
Well,freakin'try,okay?
'Cause that number of "verys" precedes sick.
Sick.
S-I-C-K.
Toldyouyouwere gonna be mean.
And condescending, as if I didn't know how to spell sick.
You are not being a nice person right now!
So,I 'matthegun range.
Thisisanightmare.
Sartre was right, "Hell is other people."
Ishouldgo , I've got my goggles on.
'Youdidthison purpose, didn't you?
'
You wanted me to find out when I was three thousand miles away.
You were telegraphing all the signs like you were Samuel fucking Morse.
You wanted me to know.
That's the part that hurts the most.
'WhywouldIwantthat ?
'
Becausemaybeyourfeelings for him are real.
Howlonghas it been going on?
Abouta month.
'Amonth!
Oh shit!
'
'I'm so sorry for interrupting the honeymoon period.'
I hear those are the best parts of a relationship.
I-I'mgonnago ,okay, I've got my goggles on --
Yes,I fuckingheardyou .
Enough with the goggles already!
Jesus Christ!
How're you gonna get off the phone and just go about your day after this, huh?
BecauseI don'tthink all of our conversations need to necessarily feel good.
'Theyshouldfeelbad then?
'
Theyshouldbe whatever the conversation should --
I don't know.
Why are you analyzing this so much?
'Oh,I 'mnot analyzing you yet.'
I'm just giving you my initial gut reaction.
CanI pleaseget off the phone with you and not feel like shit --
You hurt me!
You really hurt me this time, Kimberly.
I wanna break up with you.
I don't love you.
Dell,that'snotwhat you want to say...
ThatiswhatIwant to say actually.
I don't..
I don't love you, Kimberly.
Honestly, I don't know if I ever really did.
'And you definitely didn't.'
If you're capable of making choices that knowingly hurts the other person, that's not love.
Okay,you'remad, you're mad..
How can you say that?
'RealityisIcouldhave met any number of girls' 'to be with for a few years.'
That was your lie.
Alright?
'Texting Jack behind my back.'
'It came when I least expected it.'
I fell for it hook, line and sinker and it fucking hurts.
That was your lie.
Bravo.
'Okay,fine.'
You wanna hurt me?
You wanna be right?
Fine, go ahead.
Be right.
AllI everwanted was the truth.
No,no,youwannaberight .
'No.
Truth is not what you're after.'
'Because if you wanted the truth, then you would have to accept' 'the fact that I do --'
Whoisthis?
'I'msorry,is thisDell?
'
Who'sthis?
'Yes,hi.
ThisisNancy.'
'I'm your mother's nurse.
We met a few times.'
Yeah.
'I'mreallysorry to have to tell you this.'
'Your mother passed away.'
What?
That's impossible.
She's been okay for years now.
Her cancer's been in remission.
'Shehadaheartattack.'
Heartattack?
Why?
'Sometimesthese things just happen.'
'Thisfeelsstrange.'
'Not what I expected my train ride to feel like at all.'
Whatwere you expecting?
Iwasexpectingto read that short story.
TheRoaldDahlone ?
You already read it though.
You know the ending.
Sometimesit'snot about knowing the ending.
It can't be the same like it was the last time.
It has to be different or we'll wind up right where we started.
Iknow.
Iknow.
I promise you a change.
I promise, okay?
Youknow,I'mfallingout of love with you, right?
Justshutup for a second, please.
Whatdoyou wanna tell me, Dell?
Kimberly..
I used to find it annoying when you said "so" all the time.
It bugged the shit out of me.
And I love it.
I love it now.
After we have sex and you shrug your shoulders and you say, "I'm here all week."
I love that.
I love that a single strand of your hair can fall so perfectly to the side, and you don't even know.
I love the little blue veins behind your eyes.
I love your eyes.
Knowing you goes down as easily the best thing that's ever happened to me.
Easily.
If I were a restaurant, you'd be my special but nobody could order you because I'd just want you to be mine, just all mine.
Not in the biblical, slavery-owning sense or, uh, the pimp-prostitute dynamic of,
"You be mine, bitch!" but -- but, just in that..
You're my love.
You're my love.
But my favorite thing of all.
I like you because you like me.
I think that says a lot about how great you are as a person.
'So, um...'
'Dell.'
Believe me.
Believe me when I say..
...you almost had me.
'Isthatweirdto imaginethatoneday' 'thiswill allbeoldtous?
'
This walk, us meeting.
It'll just be an old memory.
Thatsounds..
...sad.
Hey,I gottaaskyou a really big question.
I don't know if you can handle it.
It's -- It's really big.
What?
Forgetit.
It's stupid.
What?
'Forgetit.'
It's a stupid joke.
You'd probably even figure it out by now.
WhywouldIknowthejoke?
BecauseI 'vealreadysaidit.
When?
Earlierintheconversation.
When?
Hey,comeon.
I'm so confused!
SometimesI wannastop people on the streets...
Who?
Anybody,fromall walks of life.
On their way to work, to the gym, to school!
I wanna stop them all, grab them like I'm grabbing you right now.
Rightnow?
Rightnow.
Iwannalook right into their eyes and I wanna ask them one simple question.
Where's my fucking money?
IthinkI'mgoingtofall in love with you too.
Areyoucrying?
Shutup.
'There's still my theory..' '...that this is just part of that strange dream.'
'And so..' '...even if we do kiss, you'll just wake up' 'and it'll all be over.'
Thiscan'tbe adream.
Whatifit is ?
What're you doing?
Something'swrong.
I know it, Kimberly, I know you.
You have circles under your eyes.
You were the type of girl that could sleep through wars.
And despite that, you're still looking so beautiful.
More beautiful than ever, in fact.
It's usually a sign you wanna remind the world that you're a sexual being because your man's not picking up the signal.
You've checked out of this relationship, haven't you?
You're not happy.
Also, you're listening to Roxette.
I know that means the beginning of the end.
And let's get real for a second about the ring, alright.
You're not having it sized.
I'm sure you had your ring-size burned into Jack's memory years ago.
Fuck, I still remember it, 4.5.
You didn't wear the ring because you didn't want me to see it.
Don't marry him, okay.
I want you back.
I know you want me back too.
That's why I'm here.
That's what you've been wanting to say to me this whole time --
Dell.
What?
I'mpregnant.
What?
Morningsicknesshas been keeping me up.
I just really love Roxette.
And I dressed this way not to announce to the world anything.
It was you.
I wanted to look good for you.
Because no matter how bad our relationship got
I wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for it.
Because I needed it.
I needed you in this life.
That's what I wanted to say.
Igotta..
I gotta sit down.
I'msorry.
I'm not leaving Jack.
I love him.
Wow.
You'repregnant.
I didn't see that coming.
Do you know what it is yet?
Notyet.
Hoping it's a girl.
Uh,I almostproposed to you, you know?
When we were in that hotel room in Paris.
I even picked out the ring.
I had it with me.
I was about to give it to you, and then I took it and I flushed it down the toilet.
I keep replaying that moment over and over again in my head.
Whyareyoucrying?
I'mjusthappytoseeyou.
And it's such a beautiful night.
I feel like I'm in the wrong world.
'Cause I don't belong in a world where we don't end up together.
I don't.
There are parallel universes out there where this didn't happen.
Where I was with you, and you were with me.
And whatever universe that is that's the one where my heart lives in.
I wanted so badly to go back into that dream I had the other night.
I tried so hard...to go back to sleep.
You know, I never thought love was real.
I didn't.
And now I think life isn't real without it.
That sounds like a really bad greeting card --
Don't.
Don't make it a joke.
Truth?
I think you always believed in love.
Thisisso stupid.
So irrational.
Why am I so hell-bent on getting you back?
You fucking hate Pixar movies for crying out loud.
You still have an AOL account.
I don't wanna be with a person like that.
Why does it feel so impossible to let you go?
It's an addiction, you know.
That's all it is.
It's a biochemical addiction.
It's so stupid.
If you think about it relationships are all totally narcissistic.
Basically, you're just looking for someone who'll love you as much as you love yourself.
That's all it is.
No,it'snot.
Yes,itis .
No,it'snot.
No,it'snot.
I don't know anything anymore.
But I know I do love you.
Dell- - Justgiveme aminute,okay .
This is not a dream.
This is not a dream.
OK.
OK.
This is not a dream.
This is not a dream.
This is not a dream.
This is not a dream.
How did I get here?
I don't know.
Some... somebody just transferred me here.
I don't want to give you my information again.
I just told someone five times.
Can one of you behave like a real person, please?
I'm calling about...
Right, yes.
I'm her son.
What kind of cancer are we talking about?
Well, what are her options?
What about a liver transplant?
Why not?
Ask about her Child-Pugh score.
Trust me.
What's her Child-Pugh score?
A B. Uh...
What about her bilirubin levels?
If they're low enough, they might consider yttrium-90.
Hold on.
You know, you have really bad social skills.
Can you at least pretend to not listen to my conversation?
Nobody likes that guy.
Don't be that guy.
Eyes on the prize.
Yeah.
What about yttrium-90?
Her bilirubin levels are too high?
OK.
Listen.
I'm gonna get on a flight in the morning.
So I should be at the hospital by 3:00.
But just have her call me tonight, so I know I'm wanted.
Thanks.
- Fuck!
- This is about your mom?
Yeah.
- How long are they giving her?
- I don't know.
A few years.
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.
What are you doing?
I got to roll a joint before the meteor shower starts.
- Why?
- What kind of question is that?
We're about to watch a fucking meteor shower. "Why?"
Oh, here.
It's for when you apply to college in a few years.
Use me as a reference.
You're a postdoctoral scientist at Tristana Pharmaceuticals.
- Yep.
- So you already...
Oh, that cancer-y stuff.
Yeah, I did.
Anyway, uh, I should be able to help you get into top 10 pre-med in a few years.
What makes you think I want to go pre-med?
Well, other than the fact that you knew what yttrium-90 is when most of your peers are still... battling to crack the mysteries of parallel parking?
That's just because my mom...
Your mom died of liver cancer.
Yeah.
I know.
Your book bag has a cancer ribbon pinned to it.
It can only be a picture of your mom.
Fits the age range.
You guys have the same nose bridge.
Makes sense you want to become a doctor that saves people.
Right?
Make up for the doctor that couldn't save your mom.
You know, in time, those good intentions will fade and become about the money, it always does, and you become bitter, like everyone always becomes.
And then you die, probably from cancer.
You know, 'cause that's ironic.
Is something wrong with you?
Probably, yeah.
Don't worry.
I'm working on it.
I just fired my therapist.
She was such an idiot, though.
She diagnosed me with narcissistic personality disorder.
Said I'm under the grand delusion that I'm the smartest person in the world.
To which I responded, "What if I really am?"
- You know?
- Hey.
Over here.
Watch out!
You OK?
You alright?
This... this doesn't feel real.
What?
I feel like my life just flashed before my eyes.
You know, like in a movie where the main character dies in the beginning but he keeps going, not realising he's dead.
Like, what's that movie I'm talking about?
You know what I mean.
It's like...
- What is it?
It... it's...
- Oh, uh, sure.
Uh...
Yeah, like Bruce Willis in 'The Sixth Sense'.
Exactly, yeah.
Wait, no.
You know what?
I never saw that.
Shit.
That's the twist that everyone was talking about?
Bruce Willis dies in the beginning of that?
That sucks!
Oh, I really wanted to see that.
Fuck!
Sorry.
I guess I just thought everyone had seen it.
Oh, don't worry.
No, I'm not that mad.
No.
I mean, I am, but I'll get over it.
Sorry.
That's a lie.
I'll...
I'll probably harbour this for a few more months at least.
And then... you know, we'll see... see what happens.
That's cute.
You have an eating problem?
No.
Not like...
I'm...
Sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.
Dude.
Come on.
You do realise my date isn't the one with the eating problem, right?
Oh.
What?
Uh-oh.
Kimberly's annoyed.
Kimberly?
Kimberly?
Hey.
- How do you do that?
- What?
I haven't seen you in a year when...
I was literally just thinking about you.
- Gosh.
Really?
- Yeah, because of that song.
I was listening to it as I was walking here, and it reminded me of the hotel.
The one we stayed at for my friend's wedding in Paris.
Yeah, yeah.
Paris.
The City of Lights.
And pretension, as I recall.
We had one of our biggest fights.
And that was your friend's wedding from Wisconsin, right?
What was her name?
Lenora or Leonora?
- Sarah?
Right.
- Right.
I remember that wedding.
I remember that was the one where the DJ played that Montell Jordan song twice.
Remember, the first time, we thought it was ironic, and then we realised he just liked the song.
Definitely our biggest fight.
The beginning of the end, really.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Look, it's like the Beatles, right?
I mean, I liked them when I was five.
But at a certain point, you just want something with a little more nuance, you know?
Don't get me wrong - I could handle them a little better when they had Pete Best to ground them, but past that, I don't know - they just got so... pedestrian.
- Do you come here a lot?
- Do I come to the cemetery?
I like cemeteries, you know.
They're romantic.
Especially this one.
Soccer is by far the most elegant sport.
It's gonna overtake football in America in the next two years.
Oh, God.
Really?
Two years?
A friend of mine described it perfectly.
Clock's ticking.
He blogs, "Soccer's..."
- "Soccer's chess on the field."
- Oh.
Do you have any vomit bags in there?
I guess we could just throw...
I'd hate to throw up at a grave.
Why didn't you just go to the Griffith Park Observatory, then, to watch the meteor shower?
Well, they have assholes there too.
Trust me.
And there are assholes all over this city, but rarely do you get to be next to one so spectacular.
Only knock on him, I have to say, he's from New York.
I can't stand that place.
Seriously.
It's so overrated.
Why, because of all the bridges and the culture and the history they have?
Who needs it?
I'll take Orlando any day.
They got so many more TGI Fridays.
That's why I love L.A. Los Angeles is just more...
- Oh, no.
- Modern.
There's a relevancy about it.
New York doesn't have any...
Kimberly, I was wondering if I could have your number.
- What?
- Your phone number.
Dude.
She's with me.
No.
Uh, yeah.
She is.
No, she's not.
Not yet anyway.
At best, this is a first date, and I'm shocked that that even happened.
I have nothing against you.
You might not be a bad guy.
Most likely, but maybe not.
You're incredibly handsome.
You were probably very handsome when you were a kid too.
I think that explains your lack of substance and personality.
Only because nobody's ever really challenged you before.
So now as an adult, you think everything you say means something, but it means nothing, actually.
You don't know what you're talking about, it's upsetting, and I think she probably sees through that.
You're very pretty, but you're shallow beyond belief.
Anyway, can I have your number?
- OK.
OK.
- What are you doing?
You just said all that shit.
Yeah, but it was just an observation.
And you ask my girl out in front of me?
Shit.
Sorry.
My mistake.
I see that now.
I shouldn't have done that.
She's way too beautiful.
- What?
- I should be more of a realist.
I should know I'm a C, maybe a C+ in winter, when I can cover up my body more.
Even though you're a douchebag, you're incredibly attractive, so maybe it's only fair you two pair.
What?
It rhymed.
She's right.
It rhymed.
Alright.
Let's...
Can you just put me down?
This is...
This is embarrassing now for everyone.
OK.
Come on, Josh.
The line's moving.
Let's just go.
- Come on.
- Wanna get a good seat.
The only thing wrong with you is you're a chickenshit.
- That's all.
- It's not the only problem.
- Let's go.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
- It's one of many.
- You OK?
- Yeah.
I shouldn't talk.
That's when I get into trouble.
I'm sorry I made fun of your sandwich bag.
I didn't mean to.
That's not true.
I did.
Sorry.
I'm really nervous.
It's OK.
Well, I'm sorry he bothered you.
Oh.
I'm not nervous because of him.
OK. 'Bye.
She is so... ..beautiful.
Kim, come on.
The wedding's in an hour.
You got to get ready.
So... have you ever dreamt about me?
- Dreamt about you?
- Yeah.
You know, in the 700+ days we've dated.
You ever dreamt about me?
So...
Yeah, of course.
Oh, yeah?
Like, uh...
like, sex dreams?
At first, but then we had sex and that went away.
Ha.
Is that how you really want to say that?
I was all hot to trot for you, or whatever, in the beginning, and now, you know, reality set in.
That's not what I meant.
I meant, like...
- I got it.
- A dream, like...
Ambiguous depictions of what we are, or were, or could be, stuff like that.
Will you stop it already?
I got it.
- Why, I oughta...
- Hey!
Whoa.
Put that down.
You're not yourself.
- What are you doing with that?
- I'm gonna give you what-for.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
We good?
OK.
OK.
That was fun.
Does it bother you that you don't make me happy?
- Always with the jokes.
- I'm serious.
Seriously, you went from sex dreams to not being happy.
False.
I wasn't talking about sex dreams.
You were.
And, secondly, I'm a girl, so, yes, we're non sequitur.
- Ah, that's a little clichéd.
- I want a baby.
- Point taken.
- Seriously.
Don't you want a baby?
Some day, sure.
But let's...
let's burn that bridge when we get to it, OK?
See?
Not making me happy.
How do you do that?
How do you do that?
Oh, my God, she's beautiful.
She's beyond beautiful.
She's real.
And she seems funny too.
And just have a hint of crazy.
I can feel it.
Beautiful, crazy and funny.
Jesus Christ, she's perfect.
It's really annoying.
Really...
That's... two near collisions for you now in a row.
At least this one's not fatal.
OK.
- OK?
- OK.
- 'Bye.
- Yeah.
What the fuck was that?
Comets were observed before in ancient times by many...
Wait.
Wait.
What are we doing?
Are we into chasing now?
What are we doing?
Hey.
Just stop for a second.
I saw...
I thought I saw somebody, a friend of mine, behind you, coming over, so...
Well, that's why I turned around and waited.
So, what's the big deal?
Wasn't because you were watching me?
It looked like you were kind of watching me.
No.
It was because of a friend that was behind you.
Well, so they're... so they're not there now, obviously.
Besides, you were being weird.
You were talking to yourself.
- What were you saying anyway?
- You know, you say 'so' a lot.
- It's really annoying.
- So, do...
Are you trying to make this awkward now?
- It feels awkward now.
- Awkward feels good to me.
And awkward feels awkward to me.
That's a little on the nose, don't you think?
I'm not trying to fuck you.
If that's what you're worried about.
I mean...
I'm not gonna ask you out, because I don't believe in love.
I think all relationships deteriorate into hate, indifference or...
Well, yeah, those two things.
My parents have been together for 32 years.
- And they are happily in love.
- No, they're not.
- Yes, they are.
- No, they're not.
If they haven't divorced by now, probably means they've just surrendered to the fact that being apart is much better than being together - you know, the lesser of two evils.
It's like an emotional holocaust between your parents right now.
They probably have lukewarm feelings about you too.
- I'm Dell, by the way.
- So...
No offence, but I have a...
a thing about shaking hands.
Oh, my God.
You ARE a little crazy.
- That's great.
- You're not impressing me.
- I disagree.
- You know...
You should stop trying to sound so smart all the time.
You just wind up sounding really dumb.
I realised why you date guys like that.
You have terrible taste in men 'cause you're superficial.
You're fooling yourself in the hopes of finding something redeemable.
It's 'cause of love.
That's your blind spot.
You gotta give up on that.
Wow.
OK.
Well, I thank you for your insight, stranger, but...
I actually believe love is real.
- I'm gonna go now.
- Wait.
Can I still get your number?
- Hello, boyfriend.
- Hey.
Hey.
Listen, uh...
Roxette's on and the good part's coming up.
- Can I call you back?
- Wait, wait, wait.
I have to tell you something more important really quick.
That book I'm reading, 'The Selfish Gene', Richard Dawkins.
There was this fascinating part I just read about memes.
He basically says that ideas are like genes that self-replicate and mutate like a...
like a... cultural form of evolution.
I was thinking about how that applies to us, you know, the idea of us, how we've... we've really mutated and evolved.
Because if you think about it, we were just dumb young kids when we first met, then we broke up, got back together, blah, blah, blah, and now, now we're this really mature, loving couple
who's grown respect and admiration for each other - you know what I mean?
Kimberly?
You hung up on me, didn't you?
Well, maybe you could.
Well, because I'd like her to be at the best place.
Well, then, maybe you could introduce me to the head guy at the cancer and immunology lab.
Because I've taken an interest.
That's all.
Yes, Mom, I meditated.
Yeah, I meditate before every date.
But it didn't help.
Face facts.
No-one thinks I'm special but you.
Well, I'm still technically on it, but it's not working out, trust me.
He... called himself a Bob Dylan song and then proceeded to call me a Britney Spears song.
I don't know what that means either, but it sounds insulting.
No, not him.
The one with glasses, moustache.
Looks like a child trafficker.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's the one.
Well, if I...
I got to go.
I got to go.
Can I ask you a serious question?
Do you think I have terrible taste in men?
OK.
I'm back.
Uh-huh.
- Well, I'm at...
- I have to talk to you.
- I'm on the phone.
- No...
It's really important.
- Really important.
- I'm on the frickin' phone.
Have you ever cried at one of these things?
I was wondering.
Mom, I have to go.
Something weird is happening.
- One of what things?
- These meteor shower things.
- Cried?
- Yeah.
You know, like, tears of joy, that kind of thing.
No.
I've never cried at one of these things.
Yeah, no.
Either have I, ever, ever.
In fact, I don't understand people that do it.
It's kind of bullshit, happy crying, isn't it?
What are you... what are your thoughts on that?
So...
I was on the phone.
So, yeah, you were on the phone.
Sorry.
Was it important?
More important than your question?
- Yes.
- Yes.
My mistake.
Sorry.
- I'll never interrupt you again.
- Thank you.
- OK.
- Well...
- I should get back to my date.
- I want to keep talking to you.
- What?
- For multiple reasons.
You're beautiful, but it's more than that, I promise.
Well, that's very nice, but I should go.
Maybe I'll see you in the winter, when you're a C+.
Oh.
See?
I knew it.
I knew you were superficial.
I told you.
The only reason you're talking to me is you think I'm hot.
The only reason why you won't is because you think I'm not.
Fine.
Give me a reason why I should.
I was saying, "Don't miss her."
When you saw me talking to myself, "Don't miss her."
I'm always afraid I'm gonna miss the important things in life, and something about you has given me a heightened curiosity to know you better, and that is a near-impossible feat when it comes to me, 'cause I hate getting to know people.
But I can tell you're not like the others.
- What others?
- People.
People?
You can tell I'm not a person?
Yeah.
You're not phoney like them.
I didn't say you were hot.
I said you're beautiful.
When is this dumb thing gonna happen?
It's a beautiful night, though.
What?
I never know that means, people saying it's a beautiful night.
What does that mean?
So...
Well, to me...
It means it's...
it's comfortable, familiar.
Yet deeply moving.
Right.
No, I feel you.
Like, um...
Like I'm stoned and listen to Steely Dan.
No.
Nothing at all like that.
Not like...
No.
I know.
More like an...
Yeah.
Like... floating down a serene lake in a rowboat when the sun is setting or like when the sun is...
being a part of nature.
- Stop speaking.
- Yep.
It's beautiful when the weather's not hot or cold.
Kind of like you don't notice it, kind of like it's perfect 'cause everything's so balanced.
You don't even feel it.
And while you're feeling that non-feeling... ..you look up in the sky and you almost think,
"That's why,"
because how everything is right now, all the stars and planets and us and the ground and the cells and molecules...
Right now... ..is exactly the reason.
Right now is comfortable.
You're a now person.
- True.
- Yeah.
See, I'm a five-minutes-from-now person, because five minutes from now, a gust of wind could come and blow H1 N1 in everyone's eyes.
Right.
Except that's highly unlikely.
Or five minutes from now, an earthquake could erupt and swallow us all whole.
Right.
Except that...
Shit.
That could actually happen.
Yeah - the point is I'm way too anxious about what could happen five minutes from now to be content with now.
Can't do it.
What if something good happens five minutes from now?
- Can't that happen?
- No.
What did you think was gonna happen five minutes before you met me?
Just really paranoid I'm gonna miss it.
I miss things a lot.
I don't care if I miss it because...
You're a now person.
Got it.
So, another weird thing -
I don't mind your pessimism as much as I usually mind pessimism.
That's great.
I hate people who think I'm too negative.
Also, I like your hat.
Yeah, I'm probably gonna fall in love with you.
Wow.
That's it?
What were you hoping for?
"I'm going to fall in love with you too?"
No, but...
Well, yeah.
So all that stuff about not believing in relationships...
That's just a pick-up line.
Do we have a deal, then?
'Cause you said you believe in love.
I don't.
So let's put it to the test - date each other, me and you, in a relationship.
Let's do it.
Why the hell am I shaking your hand?
I should be scared to death of who you are as a person.
Instead, I'm scared to death of weddings - death, literally.
I'd probably have a coronary right as I was walking up the aisle.
Oh, God.
Please invite me to your wedding.
I'd love to see that.
Well, that's morbid and telling.
Yeah, well, if snuff films were readily available,
I'd probably watch 'em - not gonna lie.
- Is that a deal-breaker for you?
- No.
Because for some reason, I still happen to be in love with you.
No, it's because you didn't think you'd be the one marrying me.
Wait.
You don't smoke weed.
What are you doing?
Don't do that.
So do you still love me?
I tell you all the time.
If you died right now, I'd visit your grave every single day.
Not every day.
It's crazy.
That doesn't answer the question.
Of course I love you.
It never sounds real when you say it.
Like it doesn't exist.
So, what are you doing here?
I'm going up north.
- Why would you do that?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
- I...
Of course.
I'm kidding.
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna meet someone.
So...
Right.
OK.
- How's your mom doing?
- Uh, she's actually fine.
I can't believe I haven't talked to you this long.
Her doctors were huge idiots, so I took matters in my own hands.
I figured out a way to dose her with that experimental drug we were developing in the lab.
Wait.
Are you allowed to do that?
No.
Wasn't that...
extremely dangerous?
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
- Well, she's fine now?
Yeah, completely.
She's in remission.
So...
- Dell, that's great.
- Yeah.
I mean, other than the totally unethical recklessly risking your mom's life part, that's... that's...
- You... you saved her.
- Yeah, I guess.
We should probably keep that between us, by the way, just because there's a good chance what I did was illegal... ish.
Right.
Oh.
- All aboard!
- Right.
- Uh...
- We should probably...
OK, right.
Well, still.
Wow.
Can't believe you're curing cancer now.
Does that mean you've stopped hating people?
Not at all.
Kill Zelda Fitzgerald.
Right?
- Who is that?
- Really?
I don't know who that is.
F. Scott Fitzgerald's annoying... wife.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
I'd definitely marry Rita Hayworth.
- Great hair.
- Hair, right.
Guys love her hair.
I definitely have to shit out of this one.
- Olga Kordenstitch?
Who is that?
- I don't know.
I've just always wanted to fuck an Olga.
I would definitely marry Tupac.
Kimberly Shakur.
It's got a good ring to it.
I would definitely eff Edward R. Murrow.
I picture him starting up sex with,
"Goodnight and good luck."
I'd probably laugh so much that I'd have an orgasm right then and there.
From the laughter, you know?
I lied about not seeing 'The Sixth Sense'.
- You saw it?
- Of course I saw it.
Everybody saw it.
It's amazing.
Who didn't see 'The Sixth Sense'?
Why would you lie about that?
I read in a woman's magazine that every relationship, whether it be short-term or long-term, there's usually one big lie relative to that relationship, and I just...
I wanted to get mine over with, I guess.
Why would you want to get a jump start on the lying?
Because of...
Oh, because of five minutes from now.
Well, yeah.
You're assuming that we're in a relationship, or going to be, when I'm still technically on a date with someone else, which I should probably be getting back to, by the way.
What about the handshake?
We shook hands.
You can't do that.
- I was leading you on.
- That's really fucked up.
- That's the business.
- Well, what about a friendship?
Actually, what am I talking about?
I definitely don't want to be friends with you.
I was raped, in high school, by the quarterback of the football team.
Jesus!
I know.
That is a terrible lie.
Hey.
How do you know that's a lie?
You were raped in high school by the quarterback of the football team?
I don't think after-school specials are that cliché.
You couldn't have gone with, like, a cornerback or a defensive end or something?
Well, I was just trying to get mine over with.
- Your what over who?
- My lie to you.
- You can't.
- Why can't?
Because I saw it coming, 'cause we just talked about it.
You're very good at this.
You got to wait until I'm in a completely vulnerable position where I'd really fall for it.
- Sounds really dangerous.
- Oh, yeah.
That's the problem with relationships.
- Danger?
- Or worse.
- Worse?
- You change the other person.
You are a very broken man, Dell.
In theory.
Speaking of broken men, your goateed philistine is sashaying toward us.
- Run.
Run!
Run!
- What?
What?
Well, that's settled.
Want a hit?
No way.
It has a weird effect on me.
For some reason, when I'm high, I think people can't hear me and I start speaking really loudly.
Do you remember memorising phone numbers?
I don't remember the last time I memorised a phone number.
Yeah, I don't either, actually.
Remember...
Remember checking the newspaper for movie show times?
Can remember that.
Or writing people those notes in those, like, folded-up triangles and then... putting them in their lockers?
Do you think kids still do that, as opposed to just emails or texts?
No way.
It's all about emails and texts.
Those goddamn hugs and kisses.
Oh, I hate those things.
Whenever anybody emails me hugs and kisses,
I want to just email them back oral and penetration.
Are we old?
Are we talking like old people?
Are we on the verge of joining the sweatpants culture?
Was I just saying something?
- What?
What'd I say?
- Give me that.
- Why?
- Give me that.
OK.
That's it for you.
Mmm.
I think you should, uh...
You should start drinking some coffee.
- OK?
- That's why I hate time.
I believe I want to have sex with you.
Oh, I share in that belief.
Hey.
Hey.
OK.
- What?
- Yeah.
We got to get ready.
- Come on.
- What the eff?
I thought we were gonna make it.
I know, but we got to go, Kim.
Really.
What's that?
What is that?
You ordered Chinese food?
Who orders Chinese food in Paris?
Kim, they're gonna have dinner at the wedding, you know, the wedding that we're supposed to go to in half an hour.
And you just ate lunch.
You're not full?
What does that have to do with anything?
Jesus.
This is the pot talking.
You shouldn't have smoked.
I knew it.
You got to get ready.
What are you doing?
You made me promise to get you there on time, no matter what.
- You warned me you'd do this.
- See?
This is why I hate time.
I can't enjoy my sesame chicken because of that.
Kim.
I wish I could just...
stop it or something.
Or at least just make it pause when needed, like now.
Really, I'd just get rid of it altogether.
You want to get rid of time?
How would you do that?
You know how there's time-based art?
Movies, music, plays - it's all time-based art.
There's a beginning and a middle and an end.
And you have to see it from beginning to end.
You're restrained to that time line, that way of experiencing it.
But then there's paintings - no beginning, no middle, no end.
You see what you want to see when you want to see it.
No restrictions.
It's just there.
OK.
So you want life to be a painting.
Great.
Come on.
Thanks.
So do you know you really love me?
So, what's in your pocket?
My wallet.
It's stuffed with our saved movie ticket stubs 'cause I'm a romantic like that.
- Can you please get ready?
- Shh!
Can't you see I'm trying to touch my toes?
I don't want to be that couple that's always late for things.
Can we please not be that couple?
At least for the tenure of our relationship.
Please?
You did it again.
What?
What?
I'm just saying I want us to respect time.
- Not that.
- OK.
What, then?
What did I do that I did twice now and still not know?
You said "the tenure of our relationship".
You keep speaking about our relationship as if it's ending.
OK.
You see how this relates to the time thing?
Why don't you take your own advice and instead of seeing a beginning, middle and an end, just see it as a painting.
Kimberly, what are you doing?
We're gonna be late!
And I'm gonna somehow get blamed for it.
I know it.
What... what are you reading?
Roald Dahl short stories.
So is it about a girl - you're going up north, new girlfriend, you're not telling me 'cause you think it'll make it awkward?
Right.
Yeah.
So, right?
OK.
- A girl.
- I love Roald Dahl.
It's the best.
Which one are you reading?
And are you sleeping with anyone?
The one about Hitler.
And yes.
Shit.
I didn't know he wrote one about Hitler.
Well, kind of.
Well, it's about this doctor that saves this woman's life.
She's on the verge of death through the whole delivery.
And this doctor is so determined to save this woman's life and the life of her unborn child, right?
But... it turns out...
the child's Hitler.
OK.
Did you just give away the ending?
How can I tell you what it's about without giving away the ending?
What are you talking about?
Just say it's a story about a doctor who saves a woman from a potentially fatal pregnancy.
- That's what the story's about?
- It is.
False, birdbrain.
That is not what the story's about.
It's about the... irony that the baby's Hitler.
- OK.
You're mad.
- I'm not mad.
- You're mad 'cause of the girl.
- I'm seeing a guy
- Jack.
- You're seeing a Jack?
- He's an executive at MTV.
Looks like a cross between Salvador Dali and Dwayne Wayne from 'A Different World', which is hot.
That's a weird combination.
I got to go to the bathroom really quick.
Oh, that... fucking hurt.
- What?
- You hung up on me.
- What happened?
- Because.
OK, you realise that's not an answer to my question, right?
What is it I can help you with, sir?
Have I told you how much New York reminds me of why I hate L.A. so much?
No, please do, because the New Yorker who opines the inferiorities of Los Angeles is bursting with originality.
I'm serious, Kimberly.
We gotta move here.
It is the fucking best.
It's enough already with L.A.
It's like a mix of moral nihilism and Disneyland.
- So are you.
- Hey.
Uh...
Did I tell you the proof of concept on our drug passed with flying colours?
There's actually a bidding war between a few pharmas right now.
Looks like we could be licensing it for close to 25 million.
- Money for soul seems like...
- An even swap.
Yes.
It's not like I'm not happy for you.
But you did already tell me this all this morning, remember?
- Did I really?
- Uh-huh.
Oh, shit.
Short-term memory must be shot.
What with the smoking pot and whatnot.
I'm your new second-term girlfriend, man.
Aren't you supposed to be, like, impressing me still?
Your second-term boyfriend just told you he made his bosses close to $25 million today.
- I'm not materialistic.
- Yeah, I know that.
But $25 million sort of... ..I don't know, makes that sound retarded.
OK, seeing as there's no new information in this call,
I am gonna go - I'm almost at the gun range.
Hey - don't you think it's cute that you own a gun card and I own a pot card?
Now you sound retarded.
Listen, we should probably stop saying 'retarded'.
I'm starting to feel like an asshole.
Oh, is that just now starting?
What's going on?
You sound off.
- You're off.
- No, no, no.
I'm serious.
Cadence is all over the place.
You sound a little like Ms Teschmacher when she betrayed Lex Luthor.
Something's wrong.
I can tell.
What's going on?
God, this is gonna blow.
What's going on?
Oh, shit.
This is bad, isn't it?
This is, like, infidelity bad.
I definitely heard a silence just now.
What is going on?
- You OK?
- Yeah.
You OK?
So...
- It's been a while.
- Yep.
- Glad you're finally here.
- Yeah.
Me too.
Been trying to get a hold of you for a long time now.
Do you want a tour of the place?
- No.
- Oh.
OK.
- Seriously?
- Oh, yeah.
You know I don't care about stupid shit like that.
Sorry.
I have adjusted to normal people.
So your presence is gonna take some realignment.
- Are you moving?
- Uh...
No.
Kind of.
Uh...
Do you want anything, by the way, like, uh...
I want to talk.
What?
Nothing.
For a second, I...
I forgot what you looked like.
For the record, I've never forgotten what you look like.
OK.
Chill out, OK?
I didn't sleep with anyone.
OK.
Did you see and/or touch another man's penis in any way?
Really?
Out of all the things you want to know, this is what you want to ask most?
What kind of question's that?
Of course that's what I want to know the most.
No.
Penises were not involved.
Were your boobs and/or vagina?
No!
It was... texts.
That's all it was.
Damn!
I should never have gone against my own advice.
I should always be the better-looking one in the relationship.
I just sort of hit an impasse on that.
Honestly!
Gosh.
Dell, do you really think...
Who was it?
It was my... in-between ex, Jack.
Jack?
The MTV exec?
Are you fucking serious?
I thought you hated MTV.
- Isn't he short?
- He's not tall.
Are you seriously defending him?
You can't call him short?
You have to go with "not tall"?
Jesus, you like him.
Why the fuck are you being so sangfroid over this shit?
You're being way too easy on yourself.
You should know I'm standing in the middle of a monsoon right now.
Well, so...
Maybe I should let you go, then?
Why?
Because I'm standing in the middle of a monsoon?
No, because you...
Yes!
'Cause you're standing in the middle of a monsoon.
Um...
Are you OK?
What are you staring at?
Oh!
My thesis.
That reminds me.
I've been keeping articles about you.
They said that your drug led to major breakthroughs in cancer treatment.
That's amazing, Dell.
Your mom especially must be proud.
- That's me and...
- Jack.
How long you guys been engaged?
So...
What are you talking about?
Well, you boxed up a lot of old kitchen appliances over there.
You've either declared a fatwa on General Electric or you're wedding-registering the fuck out of your friends and family.
You've been fidgeting with your ring finger nonstop.
You're also giving me that look like you're trying to think of a lie real quick.
I might beat the shit out of you.
Wedding's in a few weeks.
Question is, where's the ring?
- Getting sized.
- Huh.
Question number two - why didn't you tell me?
I was gonna tell you, before you did your whole annoying MacGyver thing.
Yeah, I don't think that's the reference you're looking for.
Does Jack even know I'm here?
- Trust me.
He knows you're here.
- What does that mean?
- Why'd you scoff?
- What scoff?
I didn't scoff.
You scoffed.
You guys fought about me coming.
I'm actually kind of flattered.
Didn't know yours truly could threaten the evil prince of the MTV generation.
First of all, Jack's leaving MTV.
His article in 'Esquire' was optioned by George Clooney.
Yeah, well, I won my fantasy baseball league last year.
Let's not talk about Jack, OK?
I'm happy to not talk about Jack.
What's the smoking rule in here?
Is he making a face?
Is that a...?
That's just how he looks.
So, I...
I had a very vivid dream the other night about us.
A vivid dream?
What was it about, this vivid dream?
It was a dream of memories, conversations that we've had.
I saved your life.
You owe the person that saved you, don't you think?
You had a dream that was really a series of memories of conversations we've had?
Yeah, don't hurt yourself.
It's not that complicated.
Well, 'cause to the brain, there's no difference between reality and dreams.
They were just memories of us over the years.
What if I don't subscribe to a culture of indentured servitude?
You can't unsubscribe.
It's a thing of nature.
It's here to stay.
But they weaved in and out of each other like those...
those M.C. Escher drawings, so one second, I'd be on the train that time that we got back together, after our first break-up.
Another second, I was on the phone in New York... ..the last time we ever talked to each other.
But they... they blended together like a...
Painting?
I saved your life.
If it weren't for me, you would have been run over by that car.
You would have been splat, just like my timeless life painting thing.
And they were all real, but there was one moment in the dream that was...
Well, it was one we never had.
It was... it was the only one.
What was it about, this made-up moment?
It's gonna sound weird - it was... us talking, after not having talked for however long.
- Wait.
I'm confused.
It was...
- This moment.
Yeah.
This moment that we're having right now, so me coming over, seeing your apartment, your life with Jack, and reconnecting.
Oh, God, I feel sick.
I blame L.A. for this.
This is what happens when you fall in love in Los Angeles.
Fuck.
So...
What is this?
- Are you breaking up with me?
- I don't want to, no.
But... you like this Jack guy, right?
You realise Jack Tripper was one of my favourite characters in all of fiction?
You've forever ruined his good name.
Shit.
Can I...
Oh, shit.
I can't even order a Jack and Coke anymore.
A vodka soda.
Vodka soda.
- My life is ruined.
- OK.
We should just get off the phone, OK?
You're mad.
And any words we exchange now are gonna be bleak at best.
You used to never want to get off the phone.
I used to want to get off the phone.
I just used to not.
And now you can't wait to get off the phone.
I don't know even know what we're fighting about anymore.
If you want to yell about Jack, fine, but I'm too tired for another one of your meta arguments.
There's no way I deserve to be treated like this.
I thought you were supposed to be my indentured servant.
- Whatever happened to that, huh?
- So...
What are you talking about right now?
I'm talking about that prescription-to-life thing.
Right, except it's subscription to nature.
- Whatever.
- You've got this backwards, kid.
- I saved your life.
- But then I saved your life.
On the train.
We ran into each together.
We got back together.
You mean when you stalked and followed me onto the train?
You got off at Chico.
You weren't supposed to get off.
You were supposed to go to Portland, but because of me, you got off at Chico and weren't on the train when it derailed.
- You could have died.
- No-one died, Dell.
- The point remains.
- No, that is not the same.
OK?
You would absolutely have died had I not saved you.
Plus, I saw that car coming.
I knew it was gonna hit you.
- And I knowingly saved you.
- Yeah, well...
That's starting to feel like a minus, not a plus.
Be that as it may, you didn't know you were saving me.
You were just trying to get back in my pants.
No!
I was trying to get you back.
Which just happens to include getting in your pants.
So yours was a sinister doing.
Mine was pure altruism.
But I knowingly saved you too.
We just went over this, pothead.
You were supposed to get off at Portland to meet Jack, but I knowingly saved you from him.
Except I didn't, did I?
Fuck.
I should have told you I loved you more, when we were together.
I mean...
I was also such a dick to you.
I just thought you'd find it endearing for some reason, like the way people feel about Don Rickles or Mussolini.
It's not an excuse.
It's just... just a reason.
Anyway, I'm sorry, OK?
I need a drink, in a bad way.
There's a bar car here, and they sell drinks.
- Let's go.
- Does that mean we have to...
We have to walk in between the cars while...
I can't do that while the train's moving.
- Oh, don't be such a pussy.
- Said the dick?
The world's at war right now, so I think we should take every little opportunity to put ourselves in harm's way, alleviate some of the guilt, you know?
No, no.
There's all the scary noises that the train makes.
And... what if I fell?
I don't have the best relationship with gravity.
Put your iPod on.
Play something calming.
That'll drown out the sound.
And I'll hold your hand so you don't fall.
Come on.
Come on.
I won't let you go.
I promise.
You ever tried asking someone, "Where's my fucking money?"
- Have you ever done that?
- You mean, like, at random?
Or when I'm actually owed money?
- No, at random, obviously.
- Right.
I don't know what I was thinking.
It's fun.
You should try it.
Ask me.
Hm?
Ask me.
Ask me, "Where's my fucking money?"
- Where's my fucking money?
- Where's MY fucking money?
Oh, no, motherfucker.
Where's my fucking money?
If I don't get my fucking money right fucking now...
Where is my goddamn money, you motherfucker?
!
If you...
What the fuck?
Jesus!
That was really fun.
Wait.
It's just that...
Well, say what you were gonna say.
And then... after you say it, maybe we should, like, not talk for a minute - you know, let a whole minute pass by without saying something.
Say what you were gonna say.
We can start right after that.
I'm really gonna miss you tomorrow.
So, wait - you're saying you dreamt this conversation, a conversation that didn't take place until now?
I'm saying I dreamt a bunch of conversations, including this one, which led me to come here, because it made me think...
about how much I regretted...
You regret meeting me, Dell?
- No.
Of course not.
- I'm glad we dated.
I needed to date you.
Before you, I only dated guys that looked good on paper.
Yeah.
Wait, what?
You were really, really smart, but also... selfish, crass.
Not always in an entertaining way, mind you.
You hated your job and your life, and you were completely comfortable being miserable.
You're horrible on paper.
And I loved you.
And being with you made me realise it doesn't have to look good on paper to feel good.
- What kind of sandwich...?
- PBJ.
Of course.
What's your favourite word?
- 'Comet'.
- 'Comet'?
Right.
Not, like, 'proliferate', 'ensconce'?
'Kerfuffle'?
'Serendipity'?
'Comet'?
Like...
'Comet'.
Yeah.
Exactly like that.
What about your least favourite word?
Oh...
I don't strongly dislike any word, I don't think.
I sort of have a love-hate relationship with the word 'finger-fuck', but that's technically two words, and I like each one separately.
Hm.
So... do you ever wish you could, like, control society for a couple minutes?
Like make them all hate MTV or something?
I don't think MTV is as important as you think it is.
You're so wrong.
MTV is so manipulative.
It's like a drug that you get hooked on at age 12 that you can't wake up from until you're probably, like, 30, when you finally realise how awful it really was.
But by then, it's too late.
It's, like, won.
You've watched all their commercials during their week sweep.
I believe it's sweeps week.
Sweeps week.
You don't deserve me.
I can tell.
That's perfect.
I want someone I don't deserve.
You think you've won me.
I can't believe you think you've won me already.
Are you... are you kidding?
You ditched a much prettier man to stay with me.
I've definitely won you.
You are so wrong, my friend.
Holy shit.
You are so easily amused.
Because of the boots, huh?
Sarah's stupid idea.
Louis L'Amour is her favourite novelist, so here we are.
You know, I just realised.
I don't even know why we're here.
I don't even like Sarah.
Fire?
Just let me have this and then we'll go.
What are you doing?
This feels like a dream.
I love it when you look out windows.
Sir.
Did you damage the bathroom about 30 minutes ago?
Well, I'm obviously gonna tell you that I didn't.
- Sir?
- What?
I'm gonna have to ask you to get off at the next stop.
Don't let me find you on here after Chico.
- OK.
Sorry.
- You got me?
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Sorry.
I don't even want to ask.
Looks like our little tryst is about to end.
Get off at Chico with me.
Please.
We can have an hour-to two-hour talk.
If you want, get you another ticket to Portland.
An hour-to two-hour talk?
That's a long time, Dell.
Well, I'm not meeting anyone, so...
Wait, what?
There's no... girl.
So, what... what was this?
Just another one of your stupid mind games, Dell?
Why did you lie?
And what happened to your hand?
You're always hiding things.
I'm sitting somewhere else.
Listen.
Wait.
No, no.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
I'm sorry.
I lied because I thought it'd make it easier, OK?
- Thought it'd make it easier?
- Yeah.
You thought it'd make what easier exactly?
- Talking to you.
- Why would it make it easier?
Because I don't think you'd talk to me if you knew I was trying to get you back.
So, what was this?
Is this a plan to win me back?
Yeah, it was.
It was a whim that turned into a plan.
How did you even know I was on this train?
Because I f...
I...
I stalked you.
You could have called, Dell.
You haven't talked to me in a long time.
- I know.
- You have my phone number.
You have my email.
But you haven't contacted me once.
- Not once in months.
- Just...
Look.
I know a great public library in Chico where we can talk.
We can talk about all of this.
You want to go to a public library to talk?
- That seems counterintuitive.
- They have a talking area.
You happen to know of a public library in Chico with a talking area?
Yeah.
First, answer my question.
How come you never proposed?
Come on, Kimberly.
You broke up with me.
How come you didn't fight for me?
It felt like the end of days when you left.
I ate ramen for months.
I had a huge sodium imbalance.
Barely got through it.
Didn't think I could do it again.
Felt like my... fucking world was gonna blow up.
So me leaving you constitutes your world blowing up?
- Yes.
It does, actually.
- Next stop, Chico.
Listen.
Come on.
I want you to do this.
Why wouldn't you want this forever?
I'd like for once to understand why you wouldn't want this always.
'Cause 'always' is scary.
There's a finality to it.
Just don't ever want you to feel like a limitation.
OK.
Let me go a different way with it.
Why are girls so scared of cockroaches, huh?
It's 'cause you think they'll hurt you, even though they can't, just like I'm afraid 'always' will hurt me.
- They're both irrational.
- False on so many fronts.
Well, why?
Girls are afraid of cockroaches because they're gross and they carry disease, proven by the fact that they're one of the biblical plagues.
Also, they love to lay eggs in your vagina.
Secondly, it's not irrational to think that commitment can hurt you, 'cause it can.
Know that when you steal a girl's 20s, it's dangerous business, buster.
You're officially on notice, Mr Pink Lighter.
Duly noted, Mrs Pink Lighter.
No.
You can't call me that.
You don't want to marry me, remember?
I didn't say that.
Where's my phone?
Where's my phone?
Where's my fucking phone?
Hey, w-w-why don't I call it?
Why are you acting like that?
- Like what?
- Uncomfortable.
In the two years we've known each other,
I have rarely seen you uncomfortable.
I'm...
I'm not.
You are.
You're hiding something from me.
Oh, God.
You just got too stoned, Kimberly.
And I thought we were going after your last cigarette.
- What are you doing?
- What are you hiding?
- You know something.
- There's no something.
You just got too high.
You best motherfucking believe there's a something.
There is always a something, OK?
This is not the first time I have felt that.
- Felt what?
- You.
Saying something like you've slipped.
I didn't slip.
Like a cartoon character on a banana peel.
You know what?
You're actually starting to freak me out.
- There's nothing going on.
- It's about time you're freaked.
OK, I hate always feeling like the freak in this relationship.
Why are you doing this?
Because there's something you're not telling me.
OK, I know you, and I know when you get uncomfortable.
And it's so rare that I have formed an acute discomfort detector on you.
Are you gonna tell me what it is, or are you gonna force me to be late to my own annoying friend's
Louis L'Amour goddamn Western-themed wedding?
Kimberly, let's not do this.
This is paranoia.
Hey.
Kim.
Look at me.
Keep looking.
You're right.
You're right.
There's something I've been wanting to tell you.
In the dream, I told you I wanted to be with you, you to leave Jack and walk out the door with me.
Wow.
Do you feel that?
What?
OK.
Calm down.
Maybe you just need some air.
Let's go up to the rooftop.
So, what else happens in this dream?
Do I...
Do I go with you, all happily ever after and the like?
Or do I slap you and tell you, "Begone"?
I don't know, actually.
We were looking at each other.
And I went to kiss you, and before our lips touched, I woke up.
What?
Maybe I never saved you that night we met.
Maybe you did die hit by that car and this... is just some afterlife fantasy playing out in your head.
- What?
- Something feels weird.
Remember how you used to love flipping the pillow over to feel the cool side?
Yeah.
That's what our relationship felt like.
Constant tossing and turning, looking for that perfect balance.
Sometimes it was there.
And other times...
I know.
I know.
You always expected us to break up.
Why was that?
Is that 'cause of your dumb five-minutes-from-now rule?
After we stopped talking, the five-minute rule started shrinking.
Went... went to four minutes, then three... ..then two, then one.
Let's go up to the rooftop.
Come on!
I thought my unconscious was trying to tell me something - you know, by dreaming that dream a few nights ago, coming here and talking to you,
I might close the gap that... that last minute.
Or...
Or none of this is really happening.
This could still be your dream.
Dun-dun-dun!
- Oh, crap!
- What?
What happened?
Fucking bird carcass on my windshield.
What?
OK.
Slow down.
Tell me what's going on.
I'm saying a fucking bird just committed suicide on my windshield.
What?
In the middle of our conversation?
What does our conversation have to do with anything?
It must mean something.
It must mean that... that... that...
Maybe the bird was commenting on our situation.
Commenting?
- You think this is commentary?
- Definitely!
I mean...
Something - the universe, cosmos, all that, via the bird - sent us a signal, yeah.
OK.
I want you to listen to me very, very carefully, OK?
OK.
You're gonna be mean, aren't you?
On this already horrible call, you're gonna be mean on top of it.
You are very, very, very...
You know what, I can't even say 'very' enough.
So just imagine an infinite number of 'very's.
OK?
Well, I don't have that kind of imagination.
I can barely picture odd-numbered things.
Well, freaking try, OK?
'Cause that number of 'very's precedes sick, sick.
S-I-C-K.
Told you you were gonna be mean, and condescending, as if I didn't already know how to spell 'sick'.
You are not being a nice person right now!
So...
I'm at the gun range.
This is a nightmare.
Sartre was right.
- Hell is other people.
- I should go.
I've got my goggles on.
You did this on purpose, didn't you?
You wanted me to find out when I was 3,000 miles away.
You were telegraphing all the signs like you were Samuel-fucking-Morse.
You wanted me to know.
That's the part that hurts the most.
Why would I want that?
'Cause maybe your feelings for him are real.
How long has it been going on?
- About a month.
- A month?
!
Oh, shit.
I'm so sorry for interrupting the honeymoon period.
Hear those are the best parts of a relationship.
I'm gonna go, OK?
I've got my goggles on.
Yes, I fucking heard you!
Enough with the goggles already!
Jesus Christ!
How are you gonna get off the phone and just go about your day after this, huh?
'Cause I don't think all of our conversations need to necessarily feel good!
They should feel bad, then?
They should be whatever the conversation should...
I don't know!
Why are you analysing this so much?
Oh, I'm not analysing it yet.
I'm just giving you my initial gut reaction.
Can I please get off the phone with you and not feel like shit?
You hurt me!
You really hurt me this time, Kimberly.
I want to break up with you.
I don't love you.
No.
That's not what you want to say.
That is what I want to say, actually.
I don't...
I don't love you, Kimberly.
Honestly, I don't know if I ever really did.
You definitely didn't.
If you're capable of making choices that knowingly hurts the other person, that's not love.
OK.
You're mad.
You're mad.
You...
How can you say that?
Reality is I could have met any number of girls to be with for a few years.
That was your lie.
Alright?
Texting Jack behind my back.
It came when I least expected it.
And I fell for it hook, line and sinker.
And it fucking hurts.
That was your lie.
- Bravo.
- OK!
Fine.
You want to hurt me?
You want to be right?
Fine.
Go ahead.
Be right.
All I ever wanted was the truth.
No.
No.
You want to be right.
Truth is not what you're after, because if you wanted the truth, then you would have to accept the fact that I do...
Who is this?
I'm sorry.
Is this Dell?
- Who's this?
- Yes.
Hi.
This is Nancy.
I'm your mother's nurse.
- We met a few times.
- Yeah.
I'm really sorry to have to tell you this.
Your mother passed away.
What?
It's impossible.
She's been OK for years now.
Her cancer's been in remission.
She had a heart attack.
Heart attack?
Why?
Sometimes these things just happen.
This feels strange.
Not what I expected my train ride to feel like at all.
What were you expecting?
I was expecting to read that short story.
The... the Roald Dahl one?
You... you already read it.
You know the ending.
Sometimes it's not about knowing the ending.
It can't be the same like it was last time.
It has to be different or we'll wind up right where we started.
I know.
I know.
I promise you I'll change.
I promise, OK?
You know I'm falling out of love with you, right?
Just shut up for a second, please.
What do you want to tell me, Dell?
Kimberly...
I used to find it really annoying that you said 'so' all the time.
Bugged the shit out of me.
And I...
I love it.
I love it now.
After we have sex and you shrug your shoulders and you say, "I'm here all week,"
love that.
I love that a single strand of your hair can fall so perfectly to the side and you don't even know.
I love the little blue veins behind your eyes.
I love your eyes.
Knowing you goes down as easily the best thing that's ever happened to me.
Easily.
If I were a restaurant, you'd be my special, but nobody could order you, 'cause I'd just want you to be mine, just all mine.
Not in, like, a biblical slavery-owning sense or a pimp-prostitute dynamic of "You be mine, bitch,"
but... but just in that...
you're my love.
You're my love.
But my favourite thing of all... ..I like you 'cause you like me.
I don't know - I think that says a lot about how great you are as a person.
So, um...
Dell.
Believe me.
Believe me when I say... ..you almost had me.
Isn't it weird to imagine that one day, this'll all be old to us?
This walk, us meeting.
Just be an old memory.
This sounds... ..sad.
Hey.
I gotta...
I gotta ask you a really big question.
I don't know if you can handle it since it... it's really big.
What?
- Forget it.
It's stupid.
- What?
Forget it.
Stupid joke.
You can probably even figure it by now.
- Why would I know the joke?
- Because I've already said it.
- When?
- Earlier in the conversation.
When?
Hey.
Come on.
I'm so confused.
Sometimes I want to stop people in the streets.
- Who?
- Anybody, all walks of life.
On the way to work, to the gym, to school.
- Grab them, like you right now.
- Right now?
Right now - look right into their eyes and I want to ask them one simple question.
"Where's my fucking money?"
I think I'm gonna fall in love with you too.
- Are you crying?
- Shut up.
There's still my theory, that this is just...
part of that strange dream.
And so... even if we do kiss, you'll just wake up and it'll all be over.
- This can't be a dream.
- What if it is?
What are you doing?
Something's wrong.
I know it, Kimberly.
I know you.
You have circles under your eyes.
You were the type of girl that could sleep through wars.
In spite that, you're still looking so beautiful - more beautiful than ever, in fact.
It's usually a sign you want to remind the world that you're a sexual being, 'cause your man's not picking up the signal.
You've checked out of this relationship, haven't you?
You're not happy.
Also, you're listening to Roxette, and I know that means the beginning of the end.
And let's get real for a second about the ring, alright?
You're not having it sized.
I'm sure you had your ring size burned into Jack's memory years ago.
Fuck, I still remember it.
4.5.
You don't wear the ring 'cause you didn't want me to see it.
Don't marry him, OK?
I want you back.
And I know you want me back too.
That's why I'm here.
That's what you've been wanting to say to me this whole time.
- Dell?
- What?
I'm pregnant.
What?
The morning sickness has been keeping me up.
I just really love Roxette.
And I dress this way not to announce to the world anything.
It was you.
I wanted to look good for you.
'Cause no matter how bad our relationship got,
I wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for it.
Because I needed it.
I needed you in this life.
That's what I wanted to say.
I gotta...
I gotta sit down.
I'm sorry.
I'm not leaving Jack.
I love him.
Wow.
You're pregnant.
I didn't see that coming.
Do you know what it is yet?
Not yet.
Hoping it's a girl.
Uh...
I almost proposed to you, you know.
When we were in that hotel room in Paris.
I even picked out the ring.
I had it with me.
I was about to give it to you.
I took it, and...
I flushed it down the toilet.
I keep replaying that moment over and over again in my head.
I...
Why are you crying?
I'm just happy to see you.
And it's such a beautiful night.
I feel like I'm in the wrong world.
'Cause I don't...
I don't belong in a world where we don't end up together, I don't.
There are parallel universes out there where this didn't happen.
Where I was with you and you were with me.
And whatever universe that is, that's the one that my heart lives in.
I wanted so badly to go back into that dream
I had the other night.
I... tried so hard to go back to sleep.
You know, I never thought love was real.
I didn't.
And now I think life isn't real without it.
And that sounds like a really bad greeting card.
Don't.
Don't make it a joke.
Truth?
I think you always believed in love.
This is so stupid.
So irrational.
Why am I so hell-bent on getting you back?
You fucking hate Pixar movies, for crying out loud.
You still have an AOL account.
I don't want to be with a person like that.
Why does it feel so impossible to let you go?
It's an addiction, you know?
That's all it is.
It's a biochemical addiction.
It's so stupid.
If you think about it, relationships are all totally narcissistic, 'cause basically, you're just looking for someone who will love you as much as you love yourself.
- That's all it is.
- No, it's not!
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.
No, it's not.
I don't know anything anymore.
But I know I do love you.
- Dell?
- Just... give me a minute, OK?
(BUTTONS CLICK)
(WHIRRING)
-(BUTTON CLICKS) -(WHIRRING STOPS)
(BUTTON CLICKS)
(MAN WHISPERS) This is not a dream.
This is not a dream.
OK.
OK.
This is not a dream.
This is not a dream.
(SIGHS)
This is not a dream.
This is not a dream.
MAN:
How did I get here?
I don't know.
Some...somebody just transferred me here.
I don't want to give you my information again.
I just told someone five times.
Can one of you behave like a real person, please?
(SIGHS) I'm calling about...
Right, yes.
I'm her son.
What kind of cancer are we talking about?
Well, what are her options?
What about a liver transplant?
Why not?
Ask about her Child-Pugh score.
Trust me.
What's her Child-Pugh score?
AB.
Uh...
What about her bilirubin levels?
If they're low enough, they might consider yttrium-90.
Hold on.
You know, you have really bad social skills.
Can you at least pretend to not listen to my conversation?
Nobody likes that guy.
Don't be that guy.
Eyes on the prize.
Yeah.
What about yttrium-90?
Her bilirubin levels are too high?
OK.
Listen.
I'm gonna get on a flight in the morning.
So I should be at the hospital by 3:00.
But just have her call me tonight, so I know I'm wanted.
Thanks.
- Fuck!
-This is about your mom?
Yeah.
- How long are they giving her?
-I don't know.
A few years.
- I'm so sorry.
-Yeah.
GIRL:
What are you doing?
I got to roll a joint before the meteor shower starts.
- Why?
-What kind of question is that?
We're about to watch a fucking meteor shower. "Why?"
Oh, here. (CLEARS THROAT)
It's for when you apply to college in a few years.
USE me 8S a YGfGFGHCG.
You're a postdoctoral scientist at Tristana Pharmaceuticals.
- Yep.
-So you already...
Oh, that cancer-y stuff.
Yeah, I did.
Anyway, uh, I should be able to help you get into top 10 pre-med in a few years.
What makes you think I want to go pre-med?
Well, other than the fact that you knew what yttrium-90 is when most of your peers are still...battling to crack the mysteries of parallel parking?
That's just because my mom...
Your mom died of liver cancer.
Yeah.
I know.
Your book bag has a cancer ribbon pinned to it.
It can only be a picture of your mom.
Fits the age range.
You guys have the same nose bridge.
Makes sense you want to become a doctor that saves people.
Right?
Make up for the doctor that couldn't save your mom.
You know, in time, those good intentions will fade and become about the money, it always does, and you become bitter, like everyone always becomes.
And then you die, probably from cancer.
You know, 'cause that's ironic.
-(SPITS) -ls something wrong with you?
Probably, yeah.
MAN:
Don't worry.
I'm working on it.
I just fired my therapist.
She was such an idiot, though.
She diagnosed me with narcissistic personality disorder.
Said I'm under the grand delusion that I'm the smartest person in the world.
To which I responded, "What if I really am?"
- You know?
-Hey.
Over here.
(GENTLE MUSIC)
Watch out!
WOMAN:
You OK?
You alright?
This...this doesn't feel real.
What?
I feel like my life just flashed before my eyes.
You know, like in a movie where the main character dies in the beginning but he keeps going, not realising he's dead.
Like, what's that movie I'm talking about?
You know what I mean.
It's like...
- What is it?
it...it's...
-Oh, uh, sure.
Uh...
Yeah, like Bruce Willis in 'The Sixth Sense'.
Exactly, yeah.
Wait, no.
You know what?
I never saw that.
Shit.
That's the twist that everyone was talking about?
Bruce Willis dies in the beginning of that?
That sucks!
Oh, I really wanted to see that.
Fuck!
Sorry.
I guess I just thought everyone had seen it.
Oh, don't worry.
No, I'm not that mad.
No.
I mean, I am, but I'll get over it.
Sorry.
That's a lie.
I'll...
I'll probably harbour this for a few more months at least.
And then...you know, we'll see...see what happens.
That's cute.
You have an eating problem?
No.
Not like...
I'm...
Sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.
Dude.
Come on.
You do realise my date isn't the one with the eating problem, right?
Oh. (CHUCKLES)
(LAUGHS) What?
Uh-oh.
Kimberly's annoyed.
(MOUTHS)
(MOUTHS)
MAN:
Kimberly?
Kimberly?
Hey.
- How do you do that?
-What?
I haven't seen you in a year when...
I was literally just thinking about you.
- Gosh.
Really?
-Yeah, because of that song.
I was listening to it as I was walking here, and it reminded me of the hotel.
The one we stayed at for my friend's wedding in Paris.
Yeah, yeah.
Paris.
The City of Lights.
And pretension, as I recall.
We had one of our biggest fights.
And that was your friend's wedding from Wisconsin, right?
What was her name?
Lenora or Leonora?
- Sarah?
Right.
-Right.
I remember that wedding.
I remember that was the one where the DJ played that Montell Jordan song twice.
Remember, the first time, we thought it was ironic, and then we realised he just liked the song.
Definitely our biggest fight.
The beginning of the end, really.
Yeah.
Yeah.
MAN:
Look, it's like the Beatles, right?
I mean, I liked them when I was five.
But at a certain point, you just want something with a little more nuance, you know?
Don't get me wrong - I could handle them a little better when they had Pete Best to ground them, but past that, I don't know - they just got so...pedestrian.
- Do you come here a lot?
-Do I come to the cemetery?
I like cemeteries, you know.
They're romantic.
Especially this one.
Soccer is by far the most elegant sport.
It's gonna overtake football in America in the next two years.
Oh, God.
Really?
Two years?
A friend of mine described it perfectly.
Clock's ticking.
He blogs, "Soccer's...
-"Soccer's chess on the field."
-Oh.
Do you have any vomit bags in there?
I guess we could just throw...
I'd hate to throw up at a grave.
Why didn't you just go to the Griffith Park Observatory, then, to watch the meteor shower?
Well, they have assholes there too.
Trust me.
And there are assholes all over this city, but rarely do you get to be next to one so spectacular.
Only knock on him, I have to say, he's from New York.
I can't stand that place.
Seriously.
It's so overrated.
Why, because of all the bridges and the culture and the history they have?
Who needs it?
I'll take Orlando any day.
They got so many more TGI Fridays.
That's why I love L.A. Los Angeles is just more...
- Oh, no.
-Modern.
There's a relevancy about it.
New York doesn't have any...
Kimberly, I was wondering if I could have your number.
- What?
-Your phone number.
Dude.
She's with me.
No.
Uh, yeah.
She is.
No, she's not.
Not yet anyway.
At best, this is a first date, and I'm shocked that that even happened.
I have nothing against you.
You might not be a bad guy.
Most likely, but maybe not.
You're incredibly handsome.
You were probably very handsome when you were a kid too.
I think that explains your lack of substance and personality.
Only because nobody's ever really challenged you before.
So now as an adult, you think everything you say means something, but it means nothing, actually.
You don't know what you're talking about, it's upsetting, and I think she probably sees through that.
You're very pretty, but you're shallow beyond belief.
Anyway, can I have your number?
- OK.
OK.
-What are you doing?
You just said all that shit.
Yeah, but it was just an observation.
And you ask my girl out in front of me?
Shit.
Sorry.
My mistake.
I see that now.
I shouldn't have done that.
She's way too beautiful.
- What?
-I should be more of a realist.
I should know I'm a C, maybe a C+ in winter, when I can cover up my body more.
Even though you're a douchebag, you're incredibly attractive, so maybe it's only fair you two pair.
(LAUGHS)
What?
It rhymed.
She's right.
It rhymed.
Alright.
Let's...
Can you just put me down?
This is...
This is embarrassing now for everyone.
OK.
Come on, Josh.
The line's moving.
Let's just go.
- KIMBERLY:
Come on.
-Wanna get a good seat.
The only thing wrong with you is you're a chickenshit.
- That's all.
-it's not the only problem.
- Let's go.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
-it's one of many.
- You OK?
-Yeah.
I shouldn't talk.
That's when I get into trouble.
I'm sorry I made fun of your sandwich bag.
I didn't mean to.
That's not true.
I did.
Sorry.
I'm really nervous.
It's OK.
Well, I'm sorry he bothered you.
Oh.
I'm not nervous because of him.
OK. 'Bye.
She is so beautiful.
MAN:
Kim, come on.
The Wedding's in an hour.
- You got to get ready.
-(SIGHS)
So...have you ever dreamt about me?
- Dreamt about you?
-Yeah.
You know, in the 700+ days we've dated.
MAN:
You ever dreamt about me?
KIMBERLY:
So...
Yeah, of course.
Oh, yeah?
Like, uh...
like, sex dreams?
At first, but then we had sex and that went away.
Ha.
Is that how you really want to say that?
I was all hot to trot for you, or whatever, in the beginning, and now, you know, reality set in.
That's not what I meant.
I meant, like...
- I got it.
-A dream, like...
Ambiguous depictions of what we are, or were, or could be, stuff like that.
Will you stop it already?
I got it.
- Why, I oughta...
-Hey!
Whoa.
Put that down.
You're not yourself.
- What are you doing with that?
-I'm gonna give you what-for.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
We good?
OK.
OK.
That was fun.
Does it bother you that you don't make me happy?
- Always with the jokes.
-I'm serious.
Seriously, you went from sex dreams to not being happy.
False.
I wasn't talking about sex dreams.
You were.
And, secondly, I'm a girl, so, yes, we're non sequitur.
- Ah, that's a little clichéd.
-I want a baby.
- Point taken.
-Seriously.
Don't you want a baby?
(SIGHS) Some day, sure.
But let's...
let's burn that bridge when we get to it, OK?
See?
Not making me happy.
How do you do that?
How do you do that?
Oh, my God, she's beautiful.
She's beyond beautiful.
She's real.
And she seems funny too.
And just have a hint of crazy.
I can feel it.
(EXHALES)
Beautiful, crazy and funny.
Jesus Christ, she's perfect.
It's really annoying.
Really...
That's...two near collisions for you now in a row.
At least this one's not fatal.
OK.
- OK?
-OK.
-' Bye.
-Yeah.
What the fuck was that?
(INDISTINCT NARRATION ON FILM)
Comets were observed before in ancient times by many...
Wait.
Wait.
What are we doing?
Are we into chasing now?
What are we doing?
Hey.
Just stop for a second.
I saw...
I thought I saw somebody, a friend of mine, behind you, coming over, so...
Well, that's why I turned around and waited.
So, what's the big deal?
Wasn't because you were watching me?
It looked like you were kind of watching me.
No.
It was because of a friend that was behind you.
Well, so they're...so they're not there now, obviously.
Besides, you were being weird.
You were talking to yourself.
- What were you saying anyway?
-You know, you say 'so' a lot.
-It's really annoying.
-So, do...
Are you trying to make this awkward now?
- It feels awkward now.
-Awkward feels good to me.
And awkward feels awkward to me.
That's a little on the nose, don't you think?
I'm not trying to fuck you.
If that's what you're worried about.
I mean...
I'm not gonna ask you out, because I don't believe in love.
I think all relationships deteriorate into hate, indifference or...
Well, yeah, those two things.
My parents have been together for 32 years.
- And they are happily in love.
-No, they're not.
- Yes, they are.
-No, they're not.
If they haven't divorced by now, probably means they've just surrendered to the fact that being apart is much better than being together - you know, the lesser of two evils.
It's like an emotional holocaust between your parents right now.
They probably have lukewarm feelings about you too.
- I'm Dell, by the way.
-So...
No offence, but I have a...
a thing about shaking hands.
Oh, my God.
You ARE a little crazy.
- That's great.
-You're not impressing me.
- I disagree.
-You know...
You should stop trying to sound so smart all the time.
You just wind up sounding really dumb.
I realised why you date guys like that.
You have terrible taste in men 'cause you're superficial.
You're fooling yourself in the hopes of finding something redeemable.
It's 'cause of love.
That's your blind spot.
You gotta give up on that.
Wow.
OK.
Well, I thank you for your insight, stranger, but...
I actually believe love is real.
- I'm gonna go now.
-Wait.
('IT MUST HAVE BEEN LOVE' BY ROXETTE)
Can I still get your number?
(PHONE RINGS)
- Hello, boyfriend.
-Hey.
Hey.
Listen, uh...
Roxette's on and the good part's coming up.
- Can I call you back?
-Wait, wait, wait.
I have to tell you something more important really quick.
That book I'm reading, 'The Selfish Gene', Richard Dawkins.

DELL:
Well, maybe you could.
(SIGHS) Well, because I'd like her to be at the best place.
Well, then, maybe you could introduce me to the head guy at the cancer and immunology lab.
Because I've taken an interest.
That's all.
Yes, Mom, I meditated.
Yeah, I meditate before every date.
But it didn't help.
Face facts.
No-one thinks I'm special but you.
(SIGHS) Well, I'm still technically on it, but it's not working out, trust me.
(SCOFFS) He...called himself a Bob Dylan song and then proceeded to call me a Britney Spears song.
I don't know what that means either, but it sounds insulting.
No, not him.
The one with glasses, moustache.
Looks like a child trafficker.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's the one.
Well, if I...
I got to go.
I got to go.
Can I ask you a serious question?
Do you think I have terrible taste in men?
OK.
I'm back.
Uh-huh.
(SIGHS)
- Well, I'm at...
-I have to talk to you.
- I'm on the phone.
-No...
It's really important.
- Really important.
-I'm on the frickin' phone.
Have you ever cried at one of these things?
I was wondering.
Mom, I have to go.
Something weird is happening.
- One of what things?
-These meteor shower things.
- Cried?
-Yeah.
You know, like, tears of joy, that kind of thing.
No.
I've never cried at one of these things.
Yeah, no.
Either have I, ever, ever.
In fact, I don't understand people that do it.
It's kind of bullshit, happy crying, isn't it?
What are you...what are your thoughts on that?
So...
I was on the phone.
So, yeah, you were on the phone.
Sorry.
Was it important?
More important than your question?
- Yes.
-Yes.
My mistake.
Sorry.
- I'll never interrupt you again.
- Thank you.
- OK.
-Well...
- I should get back to my date.
-I want to keep talking to you.
- What?
-For multiple reasons.
You're beautiful, but it's more than that, I promise.
Well, that's very nice, but I should go.
Maybe I'll see you in the winter, when you're a C+.
Oh.
See?
I knew it.
I knew you were superficial.
I told you.
The only reason you're talking to me is you think I'm hot.
The only reason why you won't is because you think I'm not.
Fine.
Give me a reason why I should.
I was saying, "Don't miss her."
When you saw me talking to myself, "Don't miss her."
I'm always afraid I'm gonna miss the important things in life, and something about you has given me a heightened curiosity to know you better, and that is a near-impossible feat when it comes to me, 'cause I hate getting to know people.
But I can tell you're not like the others.
- What others?
-People.
People?
You can tell I'm not a person?
Yeah.
You're not phoney like them.
I didn't say you were hot.
I said you're beautiful.
When is this dumb thing gonna happen?
It's a beautiful night, though.
What?
I never know that means, people saying it's a beautiful night.
What does that mean?
So...
Well, to me...
It means it's...
it's comfortable, familiar.
Yet deeply moving.
Right.
No, I feel you.
Like, um...
Like I'm stoned and listen to Steely Dan.
No.
Nothing at all like that.
Not like...
No.
I know.
More like an...
Yeah.
Like...floating down a serene lake in a rowboat when the sun is setting or like when the sun is...
being a part of nature.
- Stop speaking.
-Yep.
It's beautiful when the weather's not hot or cold.
Kind of like you don't notice it, kind of like it's perfect 'cause everything's so balanced.
You don't even feel it.
And while you're feeling that non-feeling you look up in the sky and you almost think,
"That's why,"
because how everything is right now, all the stars and planets and us and the ground and the cells and molecules...
Right now is exactly the reason.
Right now is comfortable.
You're a now person.
- True.
-Yeah.
See, I'm a five-minutes-from-now person, because five minutes from now, a gust of wind could come and blow H1 N1 in everyone's eyes.
Right.
Except that's highly unlikely.
Or five minutes from now, an earthquake could erupt and swallow us all whole.
Right.
Except that...
Shit.
That could actually happen.
Yeah - the point is I'm way too anxious about what could happen five minutes from now to be content with now.
Can't do it.
What if something good happens five minutes from now?
- Can't that happen?
-No.
What did you think was gonna happen five minutes before you met me?
Just really paranoid I'm gonna miss it.
I miss things a lot.
I don't care if I miss it because".
You're a now person.
Got it.
So, another weird thing -
I don't mind your pessimism as much as I usually mind pessimism.
That's great.
I hate people who think I'm too negative.
Also, I like your hat.
Yeah, I'm probably gonna fall in love with you.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
(SIGHS) Wow.
That's it?
What were you hoping for?
"I'm going to fall in love with you too?"
No, but...
Well, yeah.
So all that stuff about not believing in relationships...
That's just a pick-up line.
Do we have a deal, then?
'Cause you said you believe in love.
I don't.
So let's put it to the test- date each other, me and you, in a relationship.
Let's do it.
Why the hell am I shaking your hand?
I should be scared to death of who you are as a person.
Instead, I'm scared to death of weddings - death, literally.
I'd probably have a coronary right as I was walking up the aisle.
DELL:
Oh, God.
Please invite me to your wedding.
I'd love to see that.
Well, that's morbid and telling.
Yeah, well, if snuff films were readily available,
I'd probably watch 'em - not gonna lie.
- Is that a deal-breaker for you?
-No.
Because for some reason, I still happen to be in love with you.
No, it's because you didn't think you'd be the one marrying me.
Wait.
You don't smoke weed.
What are you doing?
Don't do that.
- So do you still love me?
-(SIGHS)
I tell you all the time.
If you died right now, I'd visit your grave every single day.
Not every day.
It's crazy.
That doesn't answer the question.
Of course I love you.
It never sounds real when you say it.
Like it doesn't exist.
So, what are you doing here?
I'm going up north.
- Why would you do that?
-I don't know.
- You don't know?
-I...
Of course.
I'm kidding.
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna meet someone.
So...
Right.
OK.
- How's your mom doing?
-Uh, she's actually fine.
I can't believe I haven't talked to you this long.
Her doctors were huge idiots, so I took matters in my own hands.
I figured out a way to dose her with that experimental drug we were developing in the lab.
Wait.
Are you allowed to do that?
No.
Wasn't that...
extremely dangerous?
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
-Well, she's fine now?
Yeah, completely.
She's in remission.
So...
- Dell, that's great.
-Yeah.
I mean, other than the totally unethical recklessly risking your mom's life part, that's...that's...
- You...y0u saved her.
-Yeah, I guess.
We should probably keep that between us, by the way, just because there's a good chance what I did was illegal...ish.
Right.
-(HORN TOOTS)
-Oh.
- All aboard!
-Right.
- Uh...
-We should probably...
OK, right.
Well, still.
Wow.
Can't believe you're curing cancer now.
Does that mean you've stopped hating people?
Not at all.
Kill Zelda Fitzgerald.
Right?
- Who is that?
-Really?
I don't know who that is.
F. Scott Fitzgerald's annoying...wife.
- Oh, really?
-Yeah.
DELL:
I'd definitely marry Rita Hayworth.
- Great hair.
-Hair, right.
Guys love her hair.
I definitely have to shit out of this one.
- Olga Kordenstitch?
Who is that?
-I don't know.
I've just always wanted to fuck an Olga.
I would definitely marry Tupac.
Kimberly Shakur.
It's got a good ring to it.
KIMBERLY:
I would definitely eff Edward R. Murrow.
I picture him starting up sex with,
"Goodnight and good luck."
(LAUGHS)
I'd probably laugh so much that I'd have an orgasm right then and there.
(SNORTS)
From the laughter, you know?
I lied about not seeing 'The Sixth Sense'.
- You saw it?
-Of course I saw it.
Everybody saw it.
It's amazing.
Who didn't see 'The Sixth Sense'?
Why would you lie about that?
I read in a woman's magazine that every relationship, whether it be short-term or long-term, there's usually one big lie relative to that relationship, and I just...
I wanted to get mine over with, I guess.
Why would you want to get a jump start on the lying?
Because of...
Oh, because of five minutes from now.
Well, yeah.
You're assuming that we're in a relationship, or going to be, when I'm still technically on a date with someone else, which I should probably be getting back to, by the way.
What about the handshake?
We shook hands.
You can't do that.
- I was leading you on.
-That's really fucked up.
- That's the business.
-Well, what about a friendship?
Actually, what am I talking about?
I definitely don't want to be friends with you.
I was raped, in high school, by the quarterback of the football team.
Jesus!
I know.
That is a terrible lie.
Hey.
How do you know that's a lie?
You were raped in high school by the quarterback of the football team?
I don't think after-school specials are that cliché.
You couldn't have gone with, like, a cornerback or a defensive end or something?
Well, I was just trying to get mine over with.
- Your what over who?
-My lie to you.
- You can't.
-Why can't?
Because I saw it coming, 'cause we just talked about it.
(SIGHS) You're very good at this.
You got to wait until I'm in a completely vulnerable position where I'd really fall for it.
- Sounds really dangerous.
-Oh, yeah.
That's the problem with relationships.
- Danger?
-Or worse.
- Worse?
-You change the other person.
You are a very broken man, Dell.
In theory.
Speaking of broken men, your goateed philistine is sashaying toward us.
- Run.
Run!
Run!
-What?
What?
Well, that's settled.
Want a hit?
No way.
It has a weird effect on me.
For some reason, when I'm high, I think people can't hear me and I start speaking really loudly.
(LOUDLY) Do you remember memorising phone numbers?
I don't remember the last time I memorised a phone number.
Yeah, I don't either, actually.
Remember...
Remember checking the newspaper for movie show times?
Can remember that.
Or writing people those notes in those, like, folded-up triangles and then...putting them in their lockers?
Do you think kids still do that, as opposed to just emails or texts?
No way.
It's all about emails and texts.
Those goddamn hugs and kisses.
Oh, I hate those things.
Whenever anybody emails me hugs and kisses,
I want to just email them back oral and penetration.
Are we old?
Are we talking like old people?
Are we on the verge of joining the sweatpants culture?
Was I just saying something?
- What?
What'd I say?
-Give me that.
- Why?
-Give me that.
OK.
That's it for you.
Mmm.
I think you should, uh...
You should start drinking some coffee.
- OK?
-That's why I hate time.
(SIGHS)
I believe I want to have sex with you.
Oh, I share in that belief.
Hey.
Hey.
OK.
- What?
-Yeah.
We got to get ready.
- Come on.
-What the eff?
I thought we were gonna make it.
I know, but we got to go, Kim.
Really.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
What's that?
(DOOR OPENS)
What is that?
You ordered Chinese food?
Who orders Chinese food in Paris?
Kim, they're gonna have dinner at the wedding, you know, the wedding that we're supposed to go to in half an hour.
And you just ate lunch.
You're not full?
What does that have to do with anything?
Jesus.
This is the pot talking.
You shouldn't have smoked.
I knew it.
You got to get ready.
What are you doing?
You made me promise to get you there on time, no matter what.
- You warned me you'd do this.
-See?
This is why I hate time.
I can't enjoy my sesame chicken because of that.
Kim.
I wish I could just...
stop it or something.
Or at least just make it pause when needed, like now.
Really, I'd just get rid of it altogether.
You want to get rid of time?
How would you do that?
You know how there's time-based art?
Movies, music, plays - it's all time-based art.
There's a beginning and a middle and an end.
And you have to see it from beginning to end.
You're restrained to that time line, that way of experiencing it.
But then there's paintings - no beginning, no middle, no end.
You see what you want to see when you want to see it.
No restrictions.
It's just there.
OK.
So you want life to be a painting.
Great.
Come on.
(BURP5)
Thanks.
So do you know you really love me?
So, what's in your pocket?
My wallet.
It's stuffed with our saved movie ticket stubs 'cause I'm a romantic like that.
- Can you please get ready?
-Shh!
Can't you see I'm trying to touch my toes?
I don't want to be that couple that's always late for things.
Can we please not be that couple?
At least for the tenure of our relationship.
Please?
You did it again.
What?
What?
I'm just saying I want us to respect time.
- Not that.
-OK.
What, then?
What did I do that I did twice now and still not know?
You said "the tenure of our relationship".
You keep speaking about our relationship as if it's ending.
OK.
You see how this relates to the time thing?
Why don't you take your own advice and instead of seeing a beginning, middle and an end, just see it as a painting.
-(HAIR DRYER BLOWS)
-Kimberly, what are you doing?
We're gonna be late!
And I'm gonna somehow get blamed for it.
I know it.
-(HAIR DRYER BLOWS) -(TRAIN HORN BLOWS)
What...what are you reading?
Roald Dahl short stories.
So is it about a girl - you're going up north, new girlfriend, you're not telling me 'cause you think it'll make it awkward?
Right.
Yeah.
So, right?
OK.
- A girl.
-I love Roald Dahl.
It's the best.
Which one are you reading?
And are you sleeping with anyone?
The one about Hitler.
And yes.
Shit.
I didn't know he wrote one about Hitler.
Well, kind of.
Well, it's about this doctor that saves this woman's life.
She's on the verge of death through the whole delivery.
And this doctor is so determined to save this woman's life and the life of her unborn child, right?
But...it turns out...
the child's Hitler.
OK.
Did you just give away the ending?
How can I tell you what it's about without giving away the ending?
What are you talking about?
Just say it's a story about a doctor who saves a woman from a potentially fatal pregnancy.
- That's what the story's about?
-It is.
False, birdbrain.
That is not what the story's about.
It's about the...irony that the baby's Hitler.
- OK.
You're mad.
-I'm not mad.
- You're mad 'cause of the girl.
-I'm seeing a guy
- Jack.
- You're seeing a Jack?
-He's an executive at MTV.
Looks like a cross between Salvador Dali and Dwayne Wayne from 'A Different World', which is hot.
That's a weird combination.
I got to go to the bathroom really quick.
Oh, that...fucking hurt.
- What?
-You hung up on me.
- What happened?
-Because.
OK, you realise that's not an answer to my question, right?
What is it I can help you with, sir?
Have I told you how much New York reminds me of why I hate L.A. so much?
No, please do, because the New Yorker who opines the inferiorities of Los Angeles is bursting with originality.
I'm serious, Kimberly.
We gotta move here.
It is the fucking best.
It's enough already with L.A.
It's like a mix of moral nihilism and Disneyland.
- So are you.
-Hey.
Uh...
Did I tell you the proof of concept on our drug passed with flying colours?
There's actually a bidding war between a few pharmas right now.
Looks like we could be licensing it for close to 25 million.
- Money for soul seems like...
-BOTH:
An even swap.
Yes.
It's not like I'm not happy for you.
But you did already tell me this all this morning, remember?
- Did I really?
- Uh-huh.
Oh, shit.
Short-term memory must be shot.
What with the smoking pot and whatnot.
I'm your new second-term girlfriend, man.
Aren't you supposed to be, like, impressing me still?
Your second-term boyfriend just told you he made his bosses close to $25 million today.
- I'm not materialistic.
-Yeah, I know that.
But $25 million sort of I don't know, makes that sound retarded.
OK, seeing as there's no new information in this call,
I am gonna go - I'm almost at the gun range.
Hey - don't you think it's cute that you own a gun card and I own a pot card?
Now you sound retarded.
Listen, we should probably stop saying 'retarded'.
I'm starting to feel like an asshole.
Oh, is that just now starting?
What's going on?
You sound off.
- You're off.
-No, no, no.
I'm serious.
Cadence is all over the place.
You sound a little like Ms Teschmacher when she betrayed Lex Luthor.
Something's wrong.
I can tell.
What's going on?
God, this is gonna blow.
- What's going on?
-(SIGHS)
Oh, shit.
This is bad, isn't it?
This is, like, infidelity bad.
I definitely heard a silence just now.
- What is going on?
-(THUNDER RUMBLES)
- You OK?
-Yeah.
You OK?
So...
-it's been a while.
-Yep.
- Glad you're finally here.
-Yeah.
Me too.
Been trying to get a hold of you for a long time now.
(CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)
Do you want a tour of the place?
- No.
-Oh.
OK.
- Seriously?
-Oh, yeah.
You know I don't care about stupid shit like that.
Right.
♪ It must have been love... ♪
Sorry.
I have adjusted to normal people.
So your presence is gonna take some realignment.
- Are you moving?
-Uh...
No.
Kind of.
Uh...
Do you want anything, by the way, like, uh...
I want to talk.
What?
Nothing.
For a second, I...
I forgot what you looked like.
For the record, I've never forgotten what you look like.
OK.
Chill out, OK?
I didn't sleep with anyone.
OK.
Did you see and/or touch another man's penis in any way?
Really?
Out of all the things you want to know, this is what you want to ask most?
What kind of question's that?
Of course that's what I want to know the most.
No.
Penises were not involved.
Were your boobs and/or vagina?
No!
It was...texts.
That's all it was.
Damn!
I should never have gone against my own advice.
I should always be the better-looking one in the relationship.
I just sort of hit an impasse on that.
Honestly!
Gosh.
Dell, do you really think...
Who was it?
It was my...in-between ex, Jack.
Jack?
The MTV exec?
Are you fucking serious?
I thought you hated MTV.
-Isn't he short?
-He's not tall.
Are you seriously defending him?
You can't call him short?
You have to go with "not tall"?
Jesus, you like him.
Why the fuck are you being so sangfroid over this shit?
You're being way too easy on yourself.
(THUNDER RUMBLES)
You should know I'm standing in the middle of a monsoon right now.
Well, so...
Maybe I should let you go, then?
Why?
Because I'm standing in the middle of a monsoon?
No, because you...
Yes!
'Cause you're standing in the middle of a monsoon.
(THUNDER CRACKS)
Um...
Are you OK?
What are you staring at?
KIMBERLY:
Oh!
My thesis.
That reminds me.
I've been keeping articles about you.
They said that your drug led to major breakthroughs in cancer treatment.
That's amazing, Dell.
Your mom especially must be proud.
- That's me and...
-Jack.
How long you guys been engaged?
So...
What are you talking about?
Well, you boxed up a lot of old kitchen appliances over there.
You've either declared a fatwa on General Electric or you're wedding-registering the fuck out of your friends and family.
You've been fidgeting with your ring finger nonstop.
You're also giving me that look like you're trying to think of a lie real quick.
(SIGHS)
I might beat the shit out of you.
Wedding's in a few weeks.
Question is, where's the ring?
- Getting sized.
-Huh.
Question number two - why didn't you tell me?
I was gonna tell you, before you did your whole annoying MacGyver thing.
Yeah, I don't think that's the reference you're looking for.
- Does Jack even know I'm here?
-(SCOFFS)
- Trust me.
He knows you're here.
-What does that mean?
- Why'd you scoff?
-What scoff?
I didn't scoff.
You scoffed.
You guys fought about me coming.
I'm actually kind of flattered.
Didn't know yours truly could threaten the evil prince of the MTV generation.
First of all, Jack's leaving MTV.
His article in 'Esquire' was optioned by George Clooney.
Yeah, well, I won my fantasy baseball league last year.
Let's not talk about Jack, OK?
I'm happy to not talk about Jack.
What's the smoking rule in here?
Is he making a face?
Is that a...?
DELL:
That's just how he looks.
So, I...
I had a very vivid dream the other night about us.
A vivid dream?
What was it about, this vivid dream?
DELL:
It was a dream of memories, conversations that we've had.
KIMBERLY:
I saved your life.
You owe the person that saved you, don't you think?
You had a dream that was really a series of memories of conversations we've had?
Yeah, don't hurt yourself.
It's not that complicated.
Well, 'cause to the brain, there's no difference between reality and dreams.
They were just memories of us over the years.
What if I don't subscribe to a culture of indentured servitude?
You can't unsubscribe.
It's a thing of nature.
It's here to stay.
But they weaved in and out of each other like those...
those M.C. Escher drawings, so one second, I'd be on the train that time that we got back together, after our first break-up.
Another second, I was on the phone in New York the last time we ever talked to each other.
But they...they blended together like a...
Painting?
I saved your life.
If it weren't for me, you would have been run over by that car.
You would have been splat, just like my timeless life painting thing.
And they were all real, but there was one moment in the dream that was...
Well, it was one we never had.
It was...it was the only one.
KIMBERLY:
What was it about, this made-up moment?
It's gonna sound weird - it was...us talking, after not having talked for however long.
- Wait.
I'm confused.
It was...
-This moment.
Yeah.
This moment that we're having right now, so me coming over, seeing your apartment, your life with Jack, and reconnecting.
(THUNDER RUMBLES)
Oh, God, I feel sick.
I blame L.A. for this.
This is what happens when you fall in love in Los Angeles.
Fuck.
So...
What is this?
- Are you breaking up with me?
-I don't want to, no.
But...y0u like this Jack guy, right?
You realise Jack Tripper was one of my favourite characters in all of fiction?
You've forever ruined his good name.
Shit.
Can I...
Oh, shit.
I can't even order a Jack and Coke anymore.
A vodka soda.
Vodka soda.
- My life is ruined.
-OK.
We should just get off the phone, OK?
You're mad.
And any words we exchange now are gonna be bleak at best.
You used to never want to get off the phone.
I used to want to get off the phone.
I just used to not.
And now you can't wait to get off the phone.
I don't know even know what we're fighting about anymore.
If you want to yell about Jack, fine, but I'm too tired for another one of your meta arguments.
There's no way I deserve to be treated like this.
I thought you were supposed to be my indentured servant.
- Whatever happened to that, huh?
-So...
What are you talking about right now?
I'm talking about that prescription-to-life thing.
Right, except it's subscription to nature.
- Whatever.
-You've got this backwards, kid.
- I saved your life.
-But then I saved your life.
On the train.
We ran into each together.
We got back together.
You mean when you stalked and followed me onto the train?
You got off at Chico.
You weren't supposed to get off.
You were supposed to go to Portland, but because of me, you got off at Chico and weren't on the train when it derailed.
- You could have died.
-No-one died, Dell.
- The point remains.
-No, that is not the same.
OK?
You would absolutely have died had I not saved you.
Plus, I saw that car coming.
I knew it was gonna hit you.
- And I knowingly saved you.
-Yeah, well...
That's starting to feel like a minus, not a plus.
Be that as it may, you didn't know you were saving me.
You were just trying to get back in my pants.
No!
I was trying to get you back.
Which just happens to include getting in your pants.
So yours was a sinister doing.
Mine was pure altruism.
But I knowingly saved you too.
We just went over this, pothead.
You were supposed to get off at Portland to meet Jack, but I knowingly saved you from him.
(THUNDER RUMBLES)
Except I didn't, did I?
(GLASS SHATTERS)
Fuck.
I should have told you I loved you more, when we were together.
I mean...
I was also such a dick to you.
I just thought you'd find it endearing for some reason, like the way people feel about Don Rickles or Mussolini.
It's not an excuse.
It's just...just a reason.
Anyway, I'm sorry, OK?
I need a drink, in a bad way.
There's a bar car here, and they sell drinks.
- Let's go.
-Does that mean we have to...
We have to walk in between the cars while...
I can't do that while the train's moving.
- Oh, don't be such a pussy.
-Said the dick?
The world's at war right now, so I think we should take every little opportunity to put ourselves in harm's way, alleviate some of the guilt, you know?
No, no.
There's all the scary noises that the train makes.
And...what if I fell?
I don't have the best relationship with gravity.
Put your iPod on.
Play something calming.
That'll drown out the sound.
And I'll hold your hand so you don't fall.
Come on.
Come on.
I won't let you go.
I promise.

You ever tried asking someone, "Where's my fucking money?"
- Have you ever done that?
-You mean, like, at random?
Or when I'm actually owed money?
- No, at random, obviously.
-Right.
I don't know what I was thinking.
It's fun.
You should try it.
Ask me.
-(CLEARS THROAT)
-Hm?
Ask me.
Ask me, "Where's my fucking money?"
- Where's my fucking money?
-Where's MY fucking money?
Oh, no, motherfucker.
Where's my fucking money?
If I don't get my fucking money right fucking now...
Where is my goddamn money, you motherfucker?
!
Ifyouu.
What the fuck?
(LAUGHS)
Jesus!
That was really fun.
Wait.
It's just that...
Well, say what you were gonna say.
And then...after you say it, maybe we should, like, not talk for a minute - you know, let a whole minute pass by without saying something.
Say what you were gonna say.
We can start right after that.
I'm really gonna miss you tomorrow.
(GENTLE MUSIC)
(MOUTHS)
So, wait - you're saying you dreamt this conversation, a conversation that didn't take place until now?
I'm saying I dreamt a bunch of conversations, including this one, which led me to come here, because it made me think...
about how much I regretted...
You regret meeting me, Dell?
- No.
Of course not.
-I'm glad we dated.
I needed to date you.
Before you, I only dated guys that looked good on paper.
Yeah.
Wait, what?
You were really, really smart, but also...selfish, crass.
Not always in an entertaining way, mind you.
You hated your job and your life, and you were completely comfortable being miserable.
You're horrible on paper.
And I loved you.
And being with you made me realise it doesn't have to look good on paper to feel good.
- DELL:
What kind of sandwich...?
-KIMBERLY:
PBJ.
DELL:
Of course.
KIMBERLY:
What's your favourite word?
- DELL: 'Comet'.
-KIMBERLY: 'Comet'?
DELL:
Right.
KIMBERLY:
Not, like, 'proliferate', 'ensconce'?
'Kerfuffle'?
'Serendipity'?
'Comet'?
Like... (MAKES WHOOSHING NOISE)
KIMBERLY: 'Comet'.
DELL:
Yeah.
Exactly like that.
KIMBERLY:
What about your least favourite word?
DELL:
Oh...
I don't strongly dislike any word, I don't think.
I sort of have a love-hate relationship with the word 'finger-fuck', but that's technically two words, and I like each one separately.
KIMBERLY:
Hm.
So...do you ever wish you could, like, control society for a couple minutes?
Like make them all hate MTV or something?
I don't think MTV is as important as you think it is.
You're so wrong.
MTV is so manipulative.
It's like a drug that you get hooked on at age 12 that you can't wake up from until you're probably, like, 30, when you finally realise how awful it really was.
But by then, it's too late.
It's, like, won.
You've watched all their commercials during their week sweep.
DELL:
I believe it's sweeps week.
Sweeps week.
KIMBERLY:
You don't deserve me.
I can tell.
DELL:
That's perfect.
I want someone I don't deserve.
KIMBERLY:
You think you've won me.
I can't believe you think you've won me already.
DELL:
Are you...are you kidding?
You ditched a much prettier man to stay with me.
I've definitely won you.
You are so wrong, my friend.
(FLICKS SWITCH)
Holy shit.
You are so easily amused.
Because of the boots, huh?
Sarah's stupid idea.
Louis L'Amour is her favourite novelist, so here we are.
You know, I just realised.
I don't even know why we're here.
I don't even like Sarah.
Fire?
Just let me have this and then we'll go.
What are you doing?
('FONDU AU NOIR' BY COEUR DE PIRATE PLAYS)
KIMBERLY:
This feels like a dream.
(RUMBLING)
I love it when you look out windows.
Sir.
Did you damage the bathroom about 30 minutes ago?
Well, I'm obviously gonna tell you that I didn't.
- Sir?
-What?
I'm gonna have to ask you to get off at the next stop.
Don't let me find you on here after Chico.
- OK.
Sorry.
-You got me?
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Sorry.
I don't even want to ask.
Looks like our little tryst is about to end.
Get off at Chico with me.
Please.
We can have an hour- to two-hour talk.
If you want, get you another ticket to Portland.
An hour- to two-hour talk?
That's a long time, Dell.
Well, I'm not meeting anyone, so...
Wait, what?
There's no...girl.
So, what...what was this?
Just another one of your stupid mind games, Dell?
Why did you lie?
And what happened to your hand?
You're always hiding things.
I'm sitting somewhere else.
Listen.
Wait.
No, no.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
I'm sorry.
I lied because I thought it'd make it easier, OK?
- Thought it'd make it easier?
-Yeah.
You thought it'd make what easier exactly?
- Talking to you.
-Why would it make it easier?
Because I don't think you'd talk to me if you knew I was trying to get you back.
So, what was this?
Is this a plan to win me back?
Yeah, it was.
It was a whim that turned into a plan.
How did you even know I was on this train?
Because I f...
I...
I stalked you.
You could have called, Dell.
You haven't talked to me in a long time.
- I know.
-You have my phone number.
You have my email.
But you haven't contacted me once.
- Not once in months.
-Just...
Look.
I know a great public library in Chico where we can talk.
We can talk about all of this.
You want to go to a public library to talk?
- That seems counterintuitive.
-They have a talking area.
You happen to know of a public library in Chico with a talking area?
Yeah.
First, answer my question.
How come you never proposed?
Come on, Kimberly.
You broke up with me.
How come you didn't fight for me?
It felt like the end of days when you left.
I ate ramen for months.
I had a huge sodium imbalance.
Barely got through it.
Didn't think I could do it again.
Felt like my...fucking world was gonna blow up.
So me leaving you constitutes your world blowing up?
- Yes.
It does, actually.
- P.A.:
Next stop, Chico.
Listen.
Come on.
I want you to do this.
Why wouldn't you want this forever?
I'd like for once to understand why you wouldn't want this always.
DELL: 'Cause 'always' is scary.
There's a finality to it.
Just don't ever want you to feel like a limitation.
OK.
Let me go a different way with it.
Why are girls so scared of cockroaches, huh?
It's 'cause you think they'll hurt you, even though they can't, just like I'm afraid 'always' will hurt me.
- They're both irrational.
-False on so many fronts.
Well, why?
Girls are afraid of cockroaches because they're gross and they carry disease, proven by the fact that they're one of the biblical plagues.
Also, they love to lay eggs in your vagina.
Secondly, it's not irrational to think that commitment can hurt you, 'cause it can.
Know that when you steal a girl's 20s, it's dangerous business, buster.
You're officially on notice, Mr Pink Lighter.
Duly noted, Mrs Pink Lighter.
No.
You can't call me that.
You don't want to marry me, remember?
I didn't say that.
Where's my phone?
Where's my phone?
Where's my fucking phone?
('FONDU AU NOIR' CONTINUES)
Hey, w-w-why don't I call it?
Why are you acting like that?
- Like what?
-Uncomfortable.
In the two years we've known each other,
I have rarely seen you uncomfortable.
I'm...
I'm not.
You are.
You're hiding something from me.
Oh, God.
You just got too stoned, Kimberly.
And I thought we were going after your last cigarette.
- What are you doing?
-What are you hiding?
- You know something.
-There's no something.
You just got too high.
You best motherfucking believe there's a something.
There is always a something, OK?
This is not the first time I have felt that.
- Felt what?
-You.
Saying something like you've slipped.
I didn't slip.
Like a cartoon character on a banana peel.
You know what?
You're actually starting to freak me out.
- There's nothing going on.
-it's about time you're freaked.
OK, I hate always feeling like the freak in this relationship.
Why are you doing this?
Because there's something you're not telling me.
OK, I know you, and I know when you get uncomfortable.
And it's so rare that I have formed an acute discomfort detector on you.
Are you gonna tell me what it is, or are you gonna force me to be late to my own annoying friend's
Louis L'Amour goddamn Western-themed wedding?
Kimberly, let's not do this.
This is paranoia.
Hey.
Kim.
Look at me.
Keep looking.
You're right.
You're right.
There's something I've been wanting to tell you.
In the dream, I told you I wanted to be with you, you to leave Jack and walk out the door with me.
-(RUMBLING)
-Wow.
Do you feel that?
What?
OK.
Calm down.
Maybe you just need some air.
Let's go up to the rooftop.
So, what else happens in this dream?
Do I...
Do I go with you, all happily ever after and the like?
Or do I slap you and tell you, "Begone"?
I don't know, actually.
We were looking at each other.
And I went to kiss you, and before our lips touched, I woke up.
%RUMBLING)
-KIMBERLY:
What?
Maybe I never saved you that night we met.
Maybe you did die hit by that car and this...is just some afterlife fantasy playing out in your head.
- KIMBERLY:
What?
-DELL:
Something feels weird.
KIMBERLY:
Remember how you used to love flipping the pillow over to feel the cool side?
Yeah.
That's what our relationship felt like.
Constant tossing and turning, looking for that perfect balance.
Sometimes it was there.
And other times...
I know.
I know.
You always expected us to break up.
Why was that?
Is that 'cause of your dumb five-minutes-from-now rule?
After we stopped talking, the five-minute rule started shrinking.
Went...went to four minutes, then three then two, then one.
KIMBERLY:
Let's go up to the rooftop.
Come on!
I thought my unconscious was trying to tell me something - you know, by dreaming that dream a few nights ago, coming here and talking to you,
I might close the gap that...that last minute.
Or...
Or none of this is really happening.
This could still be your dream.
Dun-dun-dun!
{RUMBLING) -(TYRES SQUEAL)
- Oh, crap!
-What?
What happened?
Fucking bird carcass on my windshield.
What?
OK.
Slow down.
Tell me what's going on.
I'm saying a fucking bird just committed suicide on my windshield.
What?
In the middle of our conversation?
What does our conversation have to do with anything?
It must mean something.
It must mean that...that...that...
Maybe the bird was commenting on our situation.
Commenting?
- You think this is commentary?
-Definitely!
I mean...
Something - the universe, cosmos, all that, via the bird - sent us a signal, yeah.
OK.
I want you to listen to me very, very carefully, OK?
OK.
You're gonna be mean, aren't you?
On this already horrible call, you're gonna be mean on top of it.
You are very, very, very...
You know what, I can't even say 'very' enough.
So just imagine an infinite number of 'very's.
OK?
Well, I don't have that kind of imagination.
I can barely picture odd-numbered things.
Well, freaking try, OK?
'Cause that number of 'very's precedes sick, sick.
S-I-C-K.
Told you you were gonna be mean, and condescending, as if I didn't already know how to spell 'sick'.
You are not being a nice person right now!
(SIGHS)
So...
I'm at the gun range.
This is a nightmare.
Sartre was right.
- Hell is other people.
-(SIGHS) I should go.
I've got my goggles on.
You did this on purpose, didn't you?
You wanted me to find out when I was 3,000 miles away.
You were telegraphing all the signs like you were Samuel-fucking-Morse.
You wanted me to know.
That's the part that hurts the most.
Why would I want that?
'Cause maybe your feelings for him are real.
How long has it been going on?
- About a month.
-A month?
!
Oh, shit.
I'm so sorry for interrupting the honeymoon period.
Hear those are the best parts of a relationship.
I'm gonna go, OK?
I've got my goggles on.
Yes, I fucking heard you!
Enough with the goggles already!
Jesus Christ!
How are you gonna get off the phone and just go about your day after this, huh?
'Cause I don't think all of our conversations need to necessarily feel good!
They should feel bad, then?
They should be whatever the conversation should...
I don't know!
Why are you analysing this so much?
Oh, I'm not analysing it yet.
I'm just giving you my initial gut reaction.
Can I please get off the phone with you and not feel like shit?
You hurt me!
(THUNDER RUMBLES)
You really hurt me this time, Kimberly.
I want to break up with you.
I don't love you.
No.
That's not what you want to say.
(PHONE BEEPS)
That is what I want to say, actually.
I don't...
I don't love you, Kimberly.
Honestly, I don't know if I ever really did.
You definitely didn't.
If you're capable of making choices that knowingly hurts the other person, that's not love.
OK.
You're mad.
You're mad.
You...
How can you say that?
Reality is I could have met any number of girls to be with for a few years.
(PHONE BEEPS)
That was your lie.
Alright?
Texting Jack behind my back.
It came when I least expected it.
And I fell for it hook, line and sinker.
And it fucking hurts.
That was your lie.
- Bravo.
-OK!
Fine.
You want to hurt me?
You want to be right?
Fine.
Go ahead.
Be right.
All I ever wanted was the truth.
No.
No.
You want to be right.
Truth is not what you're after, because if you wanted the truth, then you would have to accept the fact that I do... (CALL ENDS)
(PHONE BUZZES)
Who is this?
WOMAN:
I'm sorry.
Is this Dell?
- Who's this?
-Yes.
Hi.
This is Nancy.
I'm your mother's nurse.
- We met a few times.
-Yeah.
I'm really sorry to have to tell you this.
Your mother passed away.
What?
It's impossible.
She's been OK for years now.
Her cancer's been in remission.
She had a heart attack.
Heart attack?
Why?
Sometimes these things just happen.
KIMBERLY:
This feels strange.
Not what I expected my train ride to feel like at all.
What were you expecting?
I was expecting to read that short story.
The...the Roald Dahl one?
You...you already read it.
You know the ending.
Sometimes it's not about knowing the ending.
It can't be the same like it was last time.
It has to be different or we'll wind up right where we started.
I know.
I know.
I promise you I'll change.
I promise, OK?
You know I'm falling out of love with you, right?
Just shut up for a second, please.
(SIGHS)
What do you want to tell me, Dell?
Kimberly...
I used to find it really annoying that you said 'so' all the time.
Bugged the shit out of me.
And I...
I love it.
I love it now.
After we have sex and you shrug your shoulders and you say, "I'm here all week,"
love that.
I love that a single strand of your hair can fall so perfectly to the side and you don't even know.
I love the little blue veins behind your eyes.
-(SNIFFLES)
-I love your eyes.
Knowing you goes down as easily the best thing that's ever happened to me.
Easily.
If I were a restaurant, you'd be my special, but nobody could order you, 'cause I'd just want you to be mine, just all mine.
Not in, like, a biblical slavery-owning sense or a pimp-prostitute dynamic of "You be mine, bitch,"
but...but just in that...
you're my love.
- You're my love.
-(SIGHS)
But my favourite thing of all I like you 'cause you like me.
I don't know - I think that says a lot about how great you are as a person.
So, um...
Dell.
Believe me.
Believe me when I say you almost had me.
(DOOR OPENS)
DELL:
Isn't it weird to imagine that one day, this'll all be old to us?
This walk, us meeting.
Just be an old memory.
This sounds sad.
Hey.
I gotta...
I gotta ask you a really big question.
I don't know if you can handle it since it...it's really big.
What?
- Forget it.
It's stupid.
-What?
Forget it.
Stupid joke.
You can probably even figure it by now.
- Why would I know the joke?
-Because I've already said it.
- When?
-Earlier in the conversation.
When?
Hey.
Come on.
I'm so confused.
Sometimes I want to stop people in the streets.
- Who?
-Anybody, all walks of life.
On the way to work, to the gym, to school.
- Grab them, like you right now.
-Right now?
Right now - look right into their eyes and I want to ask them one simple question.
"Where's my fucking money?"
(SIGHS) I think I'm gonna fall in love with you too.
- Are you crying?
-Shut up.
KIMBERLY:
There's still my theory, that this is just...
part of that strange dream.
And so...even if we do kiss, you'll just wake up and it'll all be over.
- DELL:
This can't be a dream.
-KIMBERLY:
What if it is?
What are you doing?
Something's wrong.
I know it, Kimberly.
I know you.
You have circles under your eyes.
You were the type of girl that could sleep through wars.
In spite that, you're still looking so beautiful - more beautiful than ever, in fact.
It's usually a sign you want to remind the world that you're a sexual being, 'cause your man's not picking up the signal.
You've checked out of this relationship, haven't you?
You're not happy.
Also, you're listening to Roxette, and I know that means the beginning of the end.
And let's get real for a second about the ring, alright?
You're not having it sized.
I'm sure you had your ring size burned into Jack's memory years ago.
Fuck, I still remember it.
4.5.
You don't wear the ring 'cause you didn't want me to see it.
Don't marry him, OK?
I want you back.
And I know you want me back too.
That's why I'm here.
That's what you've been wanting to say to me this whole time.
- Dell?
-What?
I'm pregnant.
What?
The morning sickness has been keeping me up.
I just really love Roxette.
And I dress this way not to announce to the world anything.
It was you.
I wanted to look good for you.
'Cause no matter how bad our relationship got,
I wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for it.
Because I needed it.
I needed you in this life.
That's what I wanted to say.
I gotta...
I gotta sit down.
I'm sorry.
I'm not leaving Jack.
I love him.
Wow.
You're pregnant.
I didn't see that coming.
Do you know what it is yet?
Not yet.
Hoping it's a girl.
Uh...
I almost proposed to you, you know.
When we were in that hotel room in Paris.
I even picked out the ring.
I had it with me.
I was about to give it to you.
I took it, and...
I flushed it down the toilet.
(SIGHS) I keep replaying that moment over and over again in my head.
'U..
Why are you crying?
I'm just happy to see you.
And it's such a beautiful night.
I feel like I'm in the wrong world.
'Cause I don't...
I don't belong in a world where we don't end up together, I don't.
There are parallel universes out there where this didn't happen.
Where I was with you and you were with me.
And whatever universe that is, that's the one that my heart lives in.
I wanted so badly to go back into that dream
I had the other night.
L...tried so hard to go back to sleep.
You know, I never thought love was real.
I didn't.
And now I think life isn't real without it.
And that sounds like a really bad greeting card.
Don't.
Don't make it a joke.
Truth?
I think you always believed in love.
(SCOFFS) This is so stupid.
So irrational.
Why am I so hell-bent on getting you back?
You fucking hate Pixar movies, for crying out loud.
You still have an AOL account.
I don't want to be with a person like that.
Why does it feel so impossible to let you go?
It's an addiction, you know?
That's all it is.
It's a biochemical addiction.
It's so stupid.
If you think about it, relationships are all totally narcissistic, 'cause basically, you're just looking for someone who will love you as much as you love yourself.
- That's all it is.
-No, it's not!
- Yes, it is.
-No, it's not.
No, it's not.
I don't know anything anymore.
But I know I do love you.
- Dell?
-Just...give me a minute, OK?
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC BUILDS)

(WHIRRING)

(BUTTON CLICKS)
(MAN WHISPERS) This is not a dream.
This is not a dream.
OK.
OK.
This is not a dream.
This is not a dream.
(SIGHS)
This is not a dream.
This is not a dream.
MAN:
How did I get here?
I don't know.
Some... somebody just transferred me here.
I don't want to give you my information again.
I just told someone five times.
Can one of you behave like a real person, please?
(SIGHS) I'm calling about...
Right, yes.
I'm her son.
What kind of cancer are we talking about?
Well, what are her options?
What about a liver transplant?
Why not?
Ask about her Child-Pugh score.
Trust me.
What's her Child-Pugh score?
A B. Uh...
What about her bilirubin levels?
If they're low enough, they might consider yttrium-90.
Hold on.
You know, you have really bad social skills.
Can you at least pretend to not listen to my conversation?
Nobody likes that guy.
Don't be that guy.
Eyes on the prize.
Yeah.
What about yttrium-90?
Her bilirubin levels are too high?
OK.
Listen.
I'm gonna get on a flight in the morning.
So I should be at the hospital by 3:00.
But just have her call me tonight, so I know I'm wanted.
Thanks.
- Fuck!
- This is about your mom?
Yeah.
- How long are they giving her?
- I don't know.
A few years.
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.
GIRL:
What are you doing?
I got to roll a joint before the meteor shower starts.
- Why?
- What kind of question is that?
We're about to watch a fucking meteor shower. "Why?"
Oh, here. (CLEARS THROAT)
It's for when you apply to college in a few years.
Use me as a reference.
You're a postdoctoral scientist at Tristana Pharmaceuticals.
- Yep.
- So you already...
Oh, that cancer-y stuff.
Yeah, I did.
Anyway, uh, I should be able to help you get into top 10 pre-med in a few years.
What makes you think I want to go pre-med?
Well, other than the fact that you knew what yttrium-90 is when most of your peers are still... battling to crack the mysteries of parallel parking?
That's just because my mom...
Your mom died of liver cancer.
Yeah.
I know.
Your book bag has a cancer ribbon pinned to it.
It can only be a picture of your mom.
Fits the age range.
You guys have the same nose bridge.
Makes sense you want to become a doctor that saves people.
Right?
Make up for the doctor that couldn't save your mom.
You know, in time, those good intentions will fade and become about the money, it always does, and you become bitter, like everyone always becomes.
And then you die, probably from cancer.
You know, 'cause that's ironic.
- (SPITS)
- Is something wrong with you?
Probably, yeah.
MAN:
Don't worry.
I'm working on it.
I just fired my therapist.
She was such an idiot, though.
She diagnosed me with narcissistic personality disorder.
Said I'm under the grand delusion that I'm the smartest person in the world.
To which I responded, "What if I really am?"
- You know?
- Hey.
Over here.
(GENTLE MUSIC)
Watch out!
WOMAN:
You OK?
You alright?
This... this doesn't feel real.
What?
I feel like my life just flashed before my eyes.
You know, like in a movie where the main character dies in the beginning but he keeps going, not realising he's dead.
Like, what's that movie I'm talking about?
You know what I mean.
It's like...
- What is it?
It... it's...
- Oh, uh, sure.
Uh...
Yeah, like Bruce Willis in 'The Sixth Sense'.
Exactly, yeah.
Wait, no.
You know what?
I never saw that.
Shit.
That's the twist that everyone was talking about?
Bruce Willis dies in the beginning of that?
That sucks!
Oh, I really wanted to see that.
Fuck!
Sorry.
I guess I just thought everyone had seen it.
Oh, don't worry.
No, I'm not that mad.
No.
I mean, I am, but I'll get over it.
Sorry.
That's a lie.
I'll...
I'll probably harbour this for a few more months at least.
And then... you know, we'll see... see what happens.
That's cute.
You have an eating problem?
No.
Not like...
I'm...
Sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.
Dude.
Come on.
You do realise my date isn't the one with the eating problem, right?
Oh. (CHUCKLES)
(LAUGHS) What?
Uh-oh.
Kimberly's annoyed.
(MOUTHS)
(MOUTHS)
MAN:
Kimberly?
Kimberly?
Hey.
- How do you do that?
- What?
I haven't seen you in a year when...
I was literally just thinking about you.
- Gosh.
Really?
- Yeah, because of that song.
I was listening to it as I was walking here, and it reminded me of the hotel.
The one we stayed at for my friend's wedding in Paris.
Yeah, yeah.
Paris.
The City of Lights.
And pretension, as I recall.
We had one of our biggest fights.
And that was your friend's wedding from Wisconsin, right?
What was her name?
Lenora or Leonora?
- Sarah?
Right.
- Right.
I remember that wedding.
I remember that was the one where the DJ played that Montell Jordan song twice.
Remember, the first time, we thought it was ironic, and then we realised he just liked the song.
Definitely our biggest fight.
The beginning of the end, really.
Yeah.
Yeah.
MAN:
Look, it's like the Beatles, right?
I mean, I liked them when I was five.
But at a certain point, you just want something with a little more nuance, you know?
Don't get me wrong - I could handle them a little better when they had Pete Best to ground them, but past that, I don't know - they just got so... pedestrian.
- Do you come here a lot?
- Do I come to the cemetery?
I like cemeteries, you know.
They're romantic.
Especially this one.
Soccer is by far the most elegant sport.
It's gonna overtake football in America in the next two years.
Oh, God.
Really?
Two years?
A friend of mine described it perfectly.
Clock's ticking.
He blogs, "Soccer's..."
- "Soccer's chess on the field."
- Oh.
Do you have any vomit bags in there?
I guess we could just throw...
I'd hate to throw up at a grave.
Why didn't you just go to the Griffith Park Observatory, then, to watch the meteor shower?
Well, they have assholes there too.
Trust me.
And there are assholes all over this city, but rarely do you get to be next to one so spectacular.
Only knock on him, I have to say, he's from New York.
I can't stand that place.
Seriously.
It's so overrated.
Why, because of all the bridges and the culture and the history they have?
Who needs it?
I'll take Orlando any day.
They got so many more TGI Fridays.
That's why I love L.A. Los Angeles is just more...
- Oh, no.
- Modern.
There's a relevancy about it.
New York doesn't have any...
Kimberly, I was wondering if I could have your number.
- What?
- Your phone number.
Dude.
She's with me.
No.
Uh, yeah.
She is.
No, she's not.
Not yet anyway.
At best, this is a first date, and I'm shocked that that even happened.
I have nothing against you.
You might not be a bad guy.
Most likely, but maybe not.
You're incredibly handsome.
You were probably very handsome when you were a kid too.
I think that explains your lack of substance and personality.
Only because nobody's ever really challenged you before.
So now as an adult, you think everything you say means something, but it means nothing, actually.
You don't know what you're talking about, it's upsetting, and I think she probably sees through that.
You're very pretty, but you're shallow beyond belief.
Anyway, can I have your number?
- OK.
OK.
- What are you doing?
You just said all that shit.
Yeah, but it was just an observation.
And you ask my girl out in front of me?
Shit.
Sorry.
My mistake.
I see that now.
I shouldn't have done that.
She's way too beautiful.
- What?
- I should be more of a realist.
I should know I'm a C, maybe a C+ in winter, when I can cover up my body more.
Even though you're a douchebag, you're incredibly attractive, so maybe it's only fair you two pair.
(LAUGHS)
What?
It rhymed.
She's right.
It rhymed.
Alright.
Let's...
Can you just put me down?
This is...
This is embarrassing now for everyone.
OK.
Come on, Josh.
The line's moving.
Let's just go.
- KIMBERLY:
Come on.
- Wanna get a good seat.
The only thing wrong with you is you're a chickenshit.
- That's all.
- It's not the only problem.
- Let's go.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
- It's one of many.
- You OK?
- Yeah.
I shouldn't talk.
That's when I get into trouble.
I'm sorry I made fun of your sandwich bag.
I didn't mean to.
That's not true.
I did.
Sorry.
I'm really nervous.
It's OK.
Well, I'm sorry he bothered you.
Oh.
I'm not nervous because of him.
OK. 'Bye.
She is so... ..beautiful.
MAN:
Kim, come on.
The wedding's in an hour.
- You got to get ready.
- (SIGHS)
So... have you ever dreamt about me?
- Dreamt about you?
- Yeah.
You know, in the 700+ days we've dated.
MAN:
You ever dreamt about me?
KIMBERLY:
So...
Yeah, of course.
Oh, yeah?
Like, uh...
like, sex dreams?
At first, but then we had sex and that went away.
Ha.
Is that how you really want to say that?
I was all hot to trot for you, or whatever, in the beginning, and now, you know, reality set in.
That's not what I meant.
I meant, like...
- I got it.
- A dream, like...
Ambiguous depictions of what we are, or were, or could be, stuff like that.
Will you stop it already?
I got it.
- Why, I oughta...
- Hey!
Whoa.
Put that down.
You're not yourself.
- What are you doing with that?
- I'm gonna give you what-for.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
We good?
OK.
OK.
That was fun.
Does it bother you that you don't make me happy?
- Always with the jokes.
- I'm serious.
Seriously, you went from sex dreams to not being happy.
False.
I wasn't talking about sex dreams.
You were.
And, secondly, I'm a girl, so, yes, we're non sequitur.
- Ah, that's a little clichéd.
- I want a baby.
- Point taken.
- Seriously.
Don't you want a baby?
(SIGHS) Some day, sure.
But let's...
let's burn that bridge when we get to it, OK?
See?
Not making me happy.
How do you do that?
How do you do that?
Oh, my God, she's beautiful.
She's beyond beautiful.
She's real.
And she seems funny too.
And just have a hint of crazy.
I can feel it.
(EXHALES)
Beautiful, crazy and funny.
Jesus Christ, she's perfect.
It's really annoying.
Really...
That's... two near collisions for you now in a row.
At least this one's not fatal.
OK.
- OK?
- OK.
- 'Bye.
- Yeah.
What the fuck was that?
(INDISTINCT NARRATION ON FILM)
Comets were observed before in ancient times by many...
Wait.
Wait.
What are we doing?
Are we into chasing now?
What are we doing?
Hey.
Just stop for a second.
I saw...
I thought I saw somebody, a friend of mine, behind you, coming over, so...
Well, that's why I turned around and waited.
So, what's the big deal?
Wasn't because you were watching me?
It looked like you were kind of watching me.
No.
It was because of a friend that was behind you.
Well, so they're... so they're not there now, obviously.
Besides, you were being weird.
You were talking to yourself.
- What were you saying anyway?
- You know, you say 'so' a lot.
- It's really annoying.
- So, do...
Are you trying to make this awkward now?
- It feels awkward now.
- Awkward feels good to me.
And awkward feels awkward to me.
That's a little on the nose, don't you think?
I'm not trying to fuck you.
If that's what you're worried about.
I mean...
I'm not gonna ask you out, because I don't believe in love.
I think all relationships deteriorate into hate, indifference or...
Well, yeah, those two things.
My parents have been together for 32 years.
- And they are happily in love.
- No, they're not.
- Yes, they are.
- No, they're not.
If they haven't divorced by now, probably means they've just surrendered to the fact that being apart is much better than being together - you know, the lesser of two evils.
It's like an emotional holocaust between your parents right now.
They probably have lukewarm feelings about you too.
- I'm Dell, by the way.
- So...
No offence, but I have a...
a thing about shaking hands.
Oh, my God.
You ARE a little crazy.
- That's great.
- You're not impressing me.
- I disagree.
- You know...
You should stop trying to sound so smart all the time.
You just wind up sounding really dumb.
I realised why you date guys like that.
You have terrible taste in men 'cause you're superficial.
You're fooling yourself in the hopes of finding something redeemable.
It's 'cause of love.
That's your blind spot.
You gotta give up on that.
Wow.
OK.
Well, I thank you for your insight, stranger, but...
I actually believe love is real.
- I'm gonna go now.
- Wait.
('IT MUST HAVE BEEN LOVE' BY ROXETTE)
Can I still get your number?
(PHONE RINGS)
- Hello, boyfriend.
- Hey.
Hey.
Listen, uh...
Roxette's on and the good part's coming up.
- Can I call you back?
- Wait, wait, wait.
I have to tell you something more important really quick.
That book I'm reading, 'The Selfish Gene', Richard Dawkins.
(SINGS ALONG) ♪ Leave the winter on the ground... ♪

DELL:
Well, maybe you could.
(SIGHS) Well, because I'd like her to be at the best place.
Well, then, maybe you could introduce me to the head guy at the cancer and immunology lab.
Because I've taken an interest.
That's all.
Yes, Mom, I meditated.
Yeah, I meditate before every date.
But it didn't help.
Face facts.
No-one thinks I'm special but you.
(SIGHS) Well, I'm still technically on it, but it's not working out, trust me.
(SCOFFS) He... called himself a Bob Dylan song and then proceeded to call me a Britney Spears song.
I don't know what that means either, but it sounds insulting.
No, not him.
The one with glasses, moustache.
Looks like a child trafficker.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's the one.
Well, if I...
I got to go.
I got to go.
Can I ask you a serious question?
Do you think I have terrible taste in men?
OK.
I'm back.
Uh-huh.
(SIGHS)
- Well, I'm at...
- I have to talk to you.
- I'm on the phone.
- No...
It's really important.
- Really important.
- I'm on the frickin' phone.
Have you ever cried at one of these things?
I was wondering.
Mom, I have to go.
Something weird is happening.
- One of what things?
- These meteor shower things.
- Cried?
- Yeah.
You know, like, tears of joy, that kind of thing.
No.
I've never cried at one of these things.
Yeah, no.
Either have I, ever, ever.
In fact, I don't understand people that do it.
It's kind of bullshit, happy crying, isn't it?
What are you... what are your thoughts on that?
So...
I was on the phone.
So, yeah, you were on the phone.
Sorry.
Was it important?
More important than your question?
- Yes.
- Yes.
My mistake.
Sorry.
- I'll never interrupt you again.
- Thank you.
- OK.
- Well...
- I should get back to my date.
- I want to keep talking to you.
- What?
- For multiple reasons.
You're beautiful, but it's more than that, I promise.
Well, that's very nice, but I should go.
Maybe I'll see you in the winter, when you're a C+.
Oh.
See?
I knew it.
I knew you were superficial.
I told you.
The only reason you're talking to me is you think I'm hot.
The only reason why you won't is because you think I'm not.
Fine.
Give me a reason why I should.
I was saying, "Don't miss her."
When you saw me talking to myself, "Don't miss her."
I'm always afraid I'm gonna miss the important things in life, and something about you has given me a heightened curiosity to know you better, and that is a near-impossible feat when it comes to me, 'cause I hate getting to know people.
But I can tell you're not like the others.
- What others?
- People.
People?
You can tell I'm not a person?
Yeah.
You're not phoney like them.
I didn't say you were hot.
I said you're beautiful.
When is this dumb thing gonna happen?
It's a beautiful night, though.
What?
I never know that means, people saying it's a beautiful night.
What does that mean?
So...
Well, to me...
It means it's...
it's comfortable, familiar.
Yet deeply moving.
Right.
No, I feel you.
Like, um...
Like I'm stoned and listen to Steely Dan.
No.
Nothing at all like that.
Not like...
No.
I know.
More like an...
Yeah.
Like... floating down a serene lake in a rowboat when the sun is setting or like when the sun is...
being a part of nature.
- Stop speaking.
- Yep.
It's beautiful when the weather's not hot or cold.
Kind of like you don't notice it, kind of like it's perfect 'cause everything's so balanced.
You don't even feel it.
And while you're feeling that non-feeling... ..you look up in the sky and you almost think,
"That's why,"
because how everything is right now, all the stars and planets and us and the ground and the cells and molecules...
Right now... ..is exactly the reason.
Right now is comfortable.
You're a now person.
- True.
- Yeah.
See, I'm a five-minutes-from-now person, because five minutes from now, a gust of wind could come and blow H1 N1 in everyone's eyes.
Right.
Except that's highly unlikely.
Or five minutes from now, an earthquake could erupt and swallow us all whole.
Right.
Except that...
Shit.
That could actually happen.
Yeah - the point is I'm way too anxious about what could happen five minutes from now to be content with now.
Can't do it.
What if something good happens five minutes from now?
- Can't that happen?
- No.
What did you think was gonna happen five minutes before you met me?
Just really paranoid I'm gonna miss it.
I miss things a lot.
I don't care if I miss it because...
You're a now person.
Got it.
So, another weird thing -
I don't mind your pessimism as much as I usually mind pessimism.
That's great.
I hate people who think I'm too negative.
Also, I like your hat.
Yeah, I'm probably gonna fall in love with you.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
(SIGHS) Wow.
That's it?
What were you hoping for?
"I'm going to fall in love with you too?"
No, but...
Well, yeah.
So all that stuff about not believing in relationships...
That's just a pick-up line.
Do we have a deal, then?
'Cause you said you believe in love.
I don't.
So let's put it to the test - date each other, me and you, in a relationship.
Let's do it.
Why the hell am I shaking your hand?
I should be scared to death of who you are as a person.
Instead, I'm scared to death of weddings - death, literally.
I'd probably have a coronary right as I was walking up the aisle.
DELL:
Oh, God.
Please invite me to your wedding.
I'd love to see that.
Well, that's morbid and telling.
Yeah, well, if snuff films were readily available,
I'd probably watch 'em - not gonna lie.
- Is that a deal-breaker for you?
- No.
Because for some reason, I still happen to be in love with you.
No, it's because you didn't think you'd be the one marrying me.
Wait.
You don't smoke weed.
What are you doing?
Don't do that.
- So do you still love me?
- (SIGHS)
I tell you all the time.
If you died right now, I'd visit your grave every single day.
Not every day.
It's crazy.
That doesn't answer the question.
Of course I love you.
It never sounds real when you say it.
Like it doesn't exist.
So, what are you doing here?
I'm going up north.
- Why would you do that?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
- I...
Of course.
I'm kidding.
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna meet someone.
So...
Right.
OK.
- How's your mom doing?
- Uh, she's actually fine.
I can't believe I haven't talked to you this long.
Her doctors were huge idiots, so I took matters in my own hands.
I figured out a way to dose her with that experimental drug we were developing in the lab.
Wait.
Are you allowed to do that?
No.
Wasn't that...
extremely dangerous?
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
- Well, she's fine now?
Yeah, completely.
She's in remission.
So...
- Dell, that's great.
- Yeah.
I mean, other than the totally unethical recklessly risking your mom's life part, that's... that's...
- You... you saved her.
- Yeah, I guess.
We should probably keep that between us, by the way, just because there's a good chance what I did was illegal... ish.
Right.
- (HORN TOOTS)
- Oh.
- All aboard!
- Right.
- Uh...
- We should probably...
OK, right.
Well, still.
Wow.
Can't believe you're curing cancer now.
Does that mean you've stopped hating people?
Not at all.
Kill Zelda Fitzgerald.
Right?
- Who is that?
- Really?
I don't know who that is.
F. Scott Fitzgerald's annoying... wife.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
DELL:
I'd definitely marry Rita Hayworth.
- Great hair.
- Hair, right.
Guys love her hair.
I definitely have to shit out of this one.
- Olga Kordenstitch?
Who is that?
- I don't know.
I've just always wanted to fuck an Olga.
I would definitely marry Tupac.
Kimberly Shakur.
It's got a good ring to it.
KIMBERLY:
I would definitely eff Edward R. Murrow.
I picture him starting up sex with,
"Goodnight and good luck."
(LAUGHS)
I'd probably laugh so much that I'd have an orgasm right then and there.
(SNORTS)
From the laughter, you know?
I lied about not seeing 'The Sixth Sense'.
- You saw it?
- Of course I saw it.
Everybody saw it.
It's amazing.
Who didn't see 'The Sixth Sense'?
Why would you lie about that?
I read in a woman's magazine that every relationship, whether it be short-term or long-term, there's usually one big lie relative to that relationship, and I just...
I wanted to get mine over with, I guess.
Why would you want to get a jump start on the lying?
Because of...
Oh, because of five minutes from now.
Well, yeah.
You're assuming that we're in a relationship, or going to be, when I'm still technically on a date with someone else, which I should probably be getting back to, by the way.
What about the handshake?
We shook hands.
You can't do that.
- I was leading you on.
- That's really fucked up.
- That's the business.
- Well, what about a friendship?
Actually, what am I talking about?
I definitely don't want to be friends with you.
I was raped, in high school, by the quarterback of the football team.
Jesus!
I know.
That is a terrible lie.
Hey.
How do you know that's a lie?
You were raped in high school by the quarterback of the football team?
I don't think after-school specials are that cliché.
You couldn't have gone with, like, a cornerback or a defensive end or something?
Well, I was just trying to get mine over with.
- Your what over who?
- My lie to you.
- You can't.
- Why can't?
Because I saw it coming, 'cause we just talked about it.
(SIGHS) You're very good at this.
You got to wait until I'm in a completely vulnerable position where I'd really fall for it.
- Sounds really dangerous.
- Oh, yeah.
That's the problem with relationships.
- Danger?
- Or worse.
- Worse?
- You change the other person.
You are a very broken man, Dell.
In theory.
Speaking of broken men, your goateed philistine is sashaying toward us.
- Run.
Run!
Run!
- What?
What?
Well, that's settled.
Want a hit?
No way.
It has a weird effect on me.
For some reason, when I'm high, I think people can't hear me and I start speaking really loudly.
(LOUDLY) Do you remember memorising phone numbers?
I don't remember the last time I memorised a phone number.
Yeah, I don't either, actually.
Remember...
Remember checking the newspaper for movie show times?
Can remember that.
Or writing people those notes in those, like, folded-up triangles and then... putting them in their lockers?
Do you think kids still do that, as opposed to just emails or texts?
No way.
It's all about emails and texts.
Those goddamn hugs and kisses.
Oh, I hate those things.
Whenever anybody emails me hugs and kisses,
I want to just email them back oral and penetration.
Are we old?
Are we talking like old people?
Are we on the verge of joining the sweatpants culture?
Was I just saying something?
- What?
What'd I say?
- Give me that.
- Why?
- Give me that.
OK.
That's it for you.
Mmm.
I think you should, uh...
You should start drinking some coffee.
- OK?
- That's why I hate time.
(SIGHS)
I believe I want to have sex with you.
Oh, I share in that belief.
Hey.
Hey.
OK.
- What?
- Yeah.
We got to get ready.
- Come on.
- What the eff?
I thought we were gonna make it.
I know, but we got to go, Kim.
Really.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
What's that?
(DOOR OPENS)
What is that?
You ordered Chinese food?
Who orders Chinese food in Paris?
Kim, they're gonna have dinner at the wedding, you know, the wedding that we're supposed to go to in half an hour.
And you just ate lunch.
You're not full?
What does that have to do with anything?
Jesus.
This is the pot talking.
You shouldn't have smoked.
I knew it.
You got to get ready.
What are you doing?
You made me promise to get you there on time, no matter what.
- You warned me you'd do this.
- See?
This is why I hate time.
I can't enjoy my sesame chicken because of that.
Kim.
I wish I could just...
stop it or something.
Or at least just make it pause when needed, like now.
Really, I'd just get rid of it altogether.
You want to get rid of time?
How would you do that?
You know how there's time-based art?
Movies, music, plays - it's all time-based art.
There's a beginning and a middle and an end.
And you have to see it from beginning to end.
You're restrained to that time line, that way of experiencing it.
But then there's paintings - no beginning, no middle, no end.
You see what you want to see when you want to see it.
No restrictions.
It's just there.
OK.
So you want life to be a painting.
Great.
Come on.
(BURPS)
Thanks.
So do you know you really love me?
So, what's in your pocket?
My wallet.
It's stuffed with our saved movie ticket stubs 'cause I'm a romantic like that.
- Can you please get ready?
- Shh!
Can't you see I'm trying to touch my toes?
I don't want to be that couple that's always late for things.
Can we please not be that couple?
At least for the tenure of our relationship.
Please?
You did it again.
What?
What?
I'm just saying I want us to respect time.
- Not that.
- OK.
What, then?
What did I do that I did twice now and still not know?
You said "the tenure of our relationship".
You keep speaking about our relationship as if it's ending.
OK.
You see how this relates to the time thing?
Why don't you take your own advice and instead of seeing a beginning, middle and an end, just see it as a painting.
- (HAIR DRYER BLOWS)
- Kimberly, what are you doing?
We're gonna be late!
And I'm gonna somehow get blamed for it.
I know it.
- (HAIR DRYER BLOWS) - (TRAIN HORN BLOWS)
What... what are you reading?
Roald Dahl short stories.
So is it about a girl - you're going up north, new girlfriend, you're not telling me 'cause you think it'll make it awkward?
Right.
Yeah.
So, right?
OK.
- A girl.
- I love Roald Dahl.
It's the best.
Which one are you reading?
And are you sleeping with anyone?
The one about Hitler.
And yes.
Shit.
I didn't know he wrote one about Hitler.
Well, kind of.
Well, it's about this doctor that saves this woman's life.
She's on the verge of death through the whole delivery.
And this doctor is so determined to save this woman's life and the life of her unborn child, right?
But... it turns out...
the child's Hitler.
OK.
Did you just give away the ending?
How can I tell you what it's about without giving away the ending?
What are you talking about?
Just say it's a story about a doctor who saves a woman from a potentially fatal pregnancy.
- That's what the story's about?
- It is.
False, birdbrain.
That is not what the story's about.
It's about the... irony that the baby's Hitler.
- OK.
You're mad.
- I'm not mad.
- You're mad 'cause of the girl.
- I'm seeing a guy
- Jack.
- You're seeing a Jack?
- He's an executive at MTV.
Looks like a cross between Salvador Dali and Dwayne Wayne from 'A Different World', which is hot.
That's a weird combination.
I got to go to the bathroom really quick.
Oh, that... fucking hurt.
- What?
- You hung up on me.
- What happened?
- Because.
OK, you realise that's not an answer to my question, right?
What is it I can help you with, sir?
Have I told you how much New York reminds me of why I hate L.A. so much?
No, please do, because the New Yorker who opines the inferiorities of Los Angeles is bursting with originality.
I'm serious, Kimberly.
We gotta move here.
It is the fucking best.
It's enough already with L.A.
It's like a mix of moral nihilism and Disneyland.
- So are you.
- Hey.
Uh...
Did I tell you the proof of concept on our drug passed with flying colours?
There's actually a bidding war between a few pharmas right now.
Looks like we could be licensing it for close to 25 million.
- Money for soul seems like...
- BOTH:
An even swap.
Yes.
It's not like I'm not happy for you.
But you did already tell me this all this morning, remember?
- Did I really?
- Uh-huh.
Oh, shit.
Short-term memory must be shot.
What with the smoking pot and whatnot.
I'm your new second-term girlfriend, man.
Aren't you supposed to be, like, impressing me still?
Your second-term boyfriend just told you he made his bosses close to $25 million today.
- I'm not materialistic.
- Yeah, I know that.
But $25 million sort of... ..I don't know, makes that sound retarded.
OK, seeing as there's no new information in this call,
I am gonna go - I'm almost at the gun range.
Hey - don't you think it's cute that you own a gun card and I own a pot card?
Now you sound retarded.
Listen, we should probably stop saying 'retarded'.
I'm starting to feel like an asshole.
Oh, is that just now starting?
What's going on?
You sound off.
- You're off.
- No, no, no.
I'm serious.
Cadence is all over the place.
You sound a little like Ms Teschmacher when she betrayed Lex Luthor.
Something's wrong.
I can tell.
What's going on?
God, this is gonna blow.
- What's going on?
- (SIGHS)
Oh, shit.
This is bad, isn't it?
This is, like, infidelity bad.
I definitely heard a silence just now.
- What is going on?
- (THUNDER RUMBLES)
- You OK?
- Yeah.
You OK?
So...
- It's been a while.
- Yep.
- Glad you're finally here.
- Yeah.
Me too.
Been trying to get a hold of you for a long time now.
(CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)
Do you want a tour of the place?
- No.
- Oh.
OK.
- Seriously?
- Oh, yeah.
You know I don't care about stupid shit like that.
Right.
♪ It must have been love... ♪
Sorry.
I have adjusted to normal people.
So your presence is gonna take some realignment.
- Are you moving?
- Uh...
No.
Kind of.
Uh...
Do you want anything, by the way, like, uh...
I want to talk.
What?
Nothing.
For a second, I...
I forgot what you looked like.
For the record, I've never forgotten what you look like.
OK.
Chill out, OK?
I didn't sleep with anyone.
OK.
Did you see and/or touch another man's penis in any way?
Really?
Out of all the things you want to know, this is what you want to ask most?
What kind of question's that?
Of course that's what I want to know the most.
No.
Penises were not involved.
Were your boobs and/or vagina?
No!
It was... texts.
That's all it was.
Damn!
I should never have gone against my own advice.
I should always be the better-looking one in the relationship.
I just sort of hit an impasse on that.
Honestly!
Gosh.
Dell, do you really think...
Who was it?
It was my... in-between ex, Jack.
Jack?
The MTV exec?
Are you fucking serious?
I thought you hated MTV.
- Isn't he short?
- He's not tall.
Are you seriously defending him?
You can't call him short?
You have to go with "not tall"?
Jesus, you like him.
Why the fuck are you being so sangfroid over this shit?
You're being way too easy on yourself.
(THUNDER RUMBLES)
You should know I'm standing in the middle of a monsoon right now.
Well, so...
Maybe I should let you go, then?
Why?
Because I'm standing in the middle of a monsoon?
No, because you...
Yes!
'Cause you're standing in the middle of a monsoon.
(THUNDER CRACKS)
Um...
Are you OK?
What are you staring at?
KIMBERLY:
Oh!
My thesis.
That reminds me.
I've been keeping articles about you.
They said that your drug led to major breakthroughs in cancer treatment.
That's amazing, Dell.
Your mom especially must be proud.
- That's me and...
- Jack.
How long you guys been engaged?
So...
What are you talking about?
Well, you boxed up a lot of old kitchen appliances over there.
You've either declared a fatwa on General Electric or you're wedding-registering the fuck out of your friends and family.
You've been fidgeting with your ring finger nonstop.
You're also giving me that look like you're trying to think of a lie real quick.
(SIGHS)
I might beat the shit out of you.
Wedding's in a few weeks.
Question is, where's the ring?
- Getting sized.
- Huh.
Question number two - why didn't you tell me?
I was gonna tell you, before you did your whole annoying MacGyver thing.
Yeah, I don't think that's the reference you're looking for.
- Does Jack even know I'm here?
- (SCOFFS)
- Trust me.
He knows you're here.
- What does that mean?
- Why'd you scoff?
- What scoff?
I didn't scoff.
You scoffed.
You guys fought about me coming.
I'm actually kind of flattered.
Didn't know yours truly could threaten the evil prince of the MTV generation.
First of all, Jack's leaving MTV.
His article in 'Esquire' was optioned by George Clooney.
Yeah, well, I won my fantasy baseball league last year.
Let's not talk about Jack, OK?
I'm happy to not talk about Jack.
What's the smoking rule in here?
Is he making a face?
Is that a...?
DELL:
That's just how he looks.
So, I...
I had a very vivid dream the other night about us.
A vivid dream?
What was it about, this vivid dream?
DELL:
It was a dream of memories, conversations that we've had.
KIMBERLY:
I saved your life.
You owe the person that saved you, don't you think?
You had a dream that was really a series of memories of conversations we've had?
Yeah, don't hurt yourself.
It's not that complicated.
Well, 'cause to the brain, there's no difference between reality and dreams.
They were just memories of us over the years.
What if I don't subscribe to a culture of indentured servitude?
You can't unsubscribe.
It's a thing of nature.
It's here to stay.
But they weaved in and out of each other like those...
those M.C. Escher drawings, so one second, I'd be on the train that time that we got back together, after our first break-up.
Another second, I was on the phone in New York... ..the last time we ever talked to each other.
But they... they blended together like a...
Painting?
I saved your life.
If it weren't for me, you would have been run over by that car.
You would have been splat, just like my timeless life painting thing.
And they were all real, but there was one moment in the dream that was...
Well, it was one we never had.
It was... it was the only one.
KIMBERLY:
What was it about, this made-up moment?
It's gonna sound weird - it was... us talking, after not having talked for however long.
- Wait.
I'm confused.
It was...
- This moment.
Yeah.
This moment that we're having right now, so me coming over, seeing your apartment, your life with Jack, and reconnecting.
(THUNDER RUMBLES)
Oh, God, I feel sick.
I blame L.A. for this.
This is what happens when you fall in love in Los Angeles.
Fuck.
So...
What is this?
- Are you breaking up with me?
- I don't want to, no.
But... you like this Jack guy, right?
You realise Jack Tripper was one of my favourite characters in all of fiction?
You've forever ruined his good name.
Shit.
Can I...
Oh, shit.
I can't even order a Jack and Coke anymore.
A vodka soda.
Vodka soda.
- My life is ruined.
- OK.
We should just get off the phone, OK?
You're mad.
And any words we exchange now are gonna be bleak at best.
You used to never want to get off the phone.
I used to want to get off the phone.
I just used to not.
And now you can't wait to get off the phone.
I don't know even know what we're fighting about anymore.
If you want to yell about Jack, fine, but I'm too tired for another one of your meta arguments.
There's no way I deserve to be treated like this.
I thought you were supposed to be my indentured servant.
- Whatever happened to that, huh?
- So...
What are you talking about right now?
I'm talking about that prescription-to-life thing.
Right, except it's subscription to nature.
- Whatever.
- You've got this backwards, kid.
- I saved your life.
- But then I saved your life.
On the train.
We ran into each together.
We got back together.
You mean when you stalked and followed me onto the train?
You got off at Chico.
You weren't supposed to get off.
You were supposed to go to Portland, but because of me, you got off at Chico and weren't on the train when it derailed.
- You could have died.
- No-one died, Dell.
- The point remains.
- No, that is not the same.
OK?
You would absolutely have died had I not saved you.
Plus, I saw that car coming.
I knew it was gonna hit you.
- And I knowingly saved you.
- Yeah, well...
That's starting to feel like a minus, not a plus.
Be that as it may, you didn't know you were saving me.
You were just trying to get back in my pants.
No!
I was trying to get you back.
Which just happens to include getting in your pants.
So yours was a sinister doing.
Mine was pure altruism.
But I knowingly saved you too.
We just went over this, pothead.
You were supposed to get off at Portland to meet Jack, but I knowingly saved you from him.
(THUNDER RUMBLES)
Except I didn't, did I?
(GLASS SHATTERS)
Fuck.
I should have told you I loved you more, when we were together.
I mean...
I was also such a dick to you.
I just thought you'd find it endearing for some reason, like the way people feel about Don Rickles or Mussolini.
It's not an excuse.
It's just... just a reason.
Anyway, I'm sorry, OK?
I need a drink, in a bad way.
There's a bar car here, and they sell drinks.
- Let's go.
- Does that mean we have to...
We have to walk in between the cars while...
I can't do that while the train's moving.
- Oh, don't be such a pussy.
- Said the dick?
The world's at war right now, so I think we should take every little opportunity to put ourselves in harm's way, alleviate some of the guilt, you know?
No, no.
There's all the scary noises that the train makes.
And... what if I fell?
I don't have the best relationship with gravity.
Put your iPod on.
Play something calming.
That'll drown out the sound.
And I'll hold your hand so you don't fall.
Come on.
Come on.
I won't let you go.
I promise.

You ever tried asking someone, "Where's my fucking money?"
- Have you ever done that?
- You mean, like, at random?
Or when I'm actually owed money?
- No, at random, obviously.
- Right.
I don't know what I was thinking.
It's fun.
You should try it.
Ask me.
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- Hm?
Ask me.
Ask me, "Where's my fucking money?"
- Where's my fucking money?
- Where's MY fucking money?
Oh, no, motherfucker.
Where's my fucking money?
If I don't get my fucking money right fucking now...
Where is my goddamn money, you motherfucker?
!
If you...
What the fuck?
(LAUGHS)
Jesus!
That was really fun.
Wait.
It's just that...
Well, say what you were gonna say.
And then... after you say it, maybe we should, like, not talk for a minute - you know, let a whole minute pass by without saying something.
Say what you were gonna say.
We can start right after that.
I'm really gonna miss you tomorrow.
(GENTLE MUSIC)
(MOUTHS)
So, wait - you're saying you dreamt this conversation, a conversation that didn't take place until now?
I'm saying I dreamt a bunch of conversations, including this one, which led me to come here, because it made me think...
about how much I regretted...
You regret meeting me, Dell?
- No.
Of course not.
- I'm glad we dated.
I needed to date you.
Before you, I only dated guys that looked good on paper.
Yeah.
Wait, what?
You were really, really smart, but also... selfish, crass.
Not always in an entertaining way, mind you.
You hated your job and your life, and you were completely comfortable being miserable.
You're horrible on paper.
And I loved you.
And being with you made me realise it doesn't have to look good on paper to feel good.
- DELL:
What kind of sandwich...?
- KIMBERLY:
PBJ.
DELL:
Of course.
KIMBERLY:
What's your favourite word?
- DELL: 'Comet'.
- KIMBERLY: 'Comet'?
DELL:
Right.
KIMBERLY:
Not, like, 'proliferate', 'ensconce'?
'Kerfuffle'?
'Serendipity'?
'Comet'?
Like... (MAKES WHOOSHING NOISE)
KIMBERLY: 'Comet'.
DELL:
Yeah.
Exactly like that.
KIMBERLY:
What about your least favourite word?
DELL:
Oh...
I don't strongly dislike any word, I don't think.
I sort of have a love-hate relationship with the word 'finger-fuck', but that's technically two words, and I like each one separately.
KIMBERLY:
Hm.
So... do you ever wish you could, like, control society for a couple minutes?
Like make them all hate MTV or something?
I don't think MTV is as important as you think it is.
You're so wrong.
MTV is so manipulative.
It's like a drug that you get hooked on at age 12 that you can't wake up from until you're probably, like, 30, when you finally realise how awful it really was.
But by then, it's too late.
It's, like, won.
You've watched all their commercials during their week sweep.
DELL:
I believe it's sweeps week.
Sweeps week.
KIMBERLY:
You don't deserve me.
I can tell.
DELL:
That's perfect.
I want someone I don't deserve.
KIMBERLY:
You think you've won me.
I can't believe you think you've won me already.
DELL:
Are you... are you kidding?
You ditched a much prettier man to stay with me.
I've definitely won you.
You are so wrong, my friend.
(FLICKS SWITCH)
Holy shit.
You are so easily amused.
Because of the boots, huh?
Sarah's stupid idea.
Louis L'Amour is her favourite novelist, so here we are.
You know, I just realised.
I don't even know why we're here.
I don't even like Sarah.
Fire?
Just let me have this and then we'll go.
What are you doing?
('FONDU AU NOIR' BY COEUR DE PIRATE PLAYS)
KIMBERLY:
This feels like a dream.
(RUMBLING)
I love it when you look out windows.
Sir.
Did you damage the bathroom about 30 minutes ago?
Well, I'm obviously gonna tell you that I didn't.
- Sir?
- What?
I'm gonna have to ask you to get off at the next stop.
Don't let me find you on here after Chico.
- OK.
Sorry.
- You got me?
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Sorry.
I don't even want to ask.
Looks like our little tryst is about to end.
Get off at Chico with me.
Please.
We can have an hour-to two-hour talk.
If you want, get you another ticket to Portland.
An hour-to two-hour talk?
That's a long time, Dell.
Well, I'm not meeting anyone, so...
Wait, what?
There's no... girl.
So, what... what was this?
Just another one of your stupid mind games, Dell?
Why did you lie?
And what happened to your hand?
You're always hiding things.
I'm sitting somewhere else.
Listen.
Wait.
No, no.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
I'm sorry.
I lied because I thought it'd make it easier, OK?
- Thought it'd make it easier?
- Yeah.
You thought it'd make what easier exactly?
- Talking to you.
- Why would it make it easier?
Because I don't think you'd talk to me if you knew I was trying to get you back.
So, what was this?
Is this a plan to win me back?
Yeah, it was.
It was a whim that turned into a plan.
How did you even know I was on this train?
Because I f...
I...
I stalked you.
You could have called, Dell.
You haven't talked to me in a long time.
- I know.
- You have my phone number.
You have my email.
But you haven't contacted me once.
- Not once in months.
- Just...
Look.
I know a great public library in Chico where we can talk.
We can talk about all of this.
You want to go to a public library to talk?
- That seems counterintuitive.
- They have a talking area.
You happen to know of a public library in Chico with a talking area?
Yeah.
First, answer my question.
How come you never proposed?
Come on, Kimberly.
You broke up with me.
How come you didn't fight for me?
It felt like the end of days when you left.
I ate ramen for months.
I had a huge sodium imbalance.
Barely got through it.
Didn't think I could do it again.
Felt like my... fucking world was gonna blow up.
So me leaving you constitutes your world blowing up?
- Yes.
It does, actually.
- P.A.:
Next stop, Chico.
Listen.
Come on.
I want you to do this.
Why wouldn't you want this forever?
I'd like for once to understand why you wouldn't want this always.
DELL: 'Cause 'always' is scary.
There's a finality to it.
Just don't ever want you to feel like a limitation.
OK.
Let me go a different way with it.
Why are girls so scared of cockroaches, huh?
It's 'cause you think they'll hurt you, even though they can't, just like I'm afraid 'always' will hurt me.
- They're both irrational.
- False on so many fronts.
Well, why?
Girls are afraid of cockroaches because they're gross and they carry disease, proven by the fact that they're one of the biblical plagues.
Also, they love to lay eggs in your vagina.
Secondly, it's not irrational to think that commitment can hurt you, 'cause it can.
Know that when you steal a girl's 20s, it's dangerous business, buster.
You're officially on notice, Mr Pink Lighter.
Duly noted, Mrs Pink Lighter.
No.
You can't call me that.
You don't want to marry me, remember?
I didn't say that.
Where's my phone?
Where's my phone?
Where's my fucking phone?
('FONDU AU NOIR' CONTINUES)
Hey, w-w-why don't I call it?
Why are you acting like that?
- Like what?
- Uncomfortable.
In the two years we've known each other,
I have rarely seen you uncomfortable.
I'm...
I'm not.
You are.
You're hiding something from me.
Oh, God.
You just got too stoned, Kimberly.
And I thought we were going after your last cigarette.
- What are you doing?
- What are you hiding?
- You know something.
- There's no something.
You just got too high.
You best motherfucking believe there's a something.
There is always a something, OK?
This is not the first time I have felt that.
- Felt what?
- You.
Saying something like you've slipped.
I didn't slip.
Like a cartoon character on a banana peel.
You know what?
You're actually starting to freak me out.
- There's nothing going on.
- It's about time you're freaked.
OK, I hate always feeling like the freak in this relationship.
Why are you doing this?
Because there's something you're not telling me.
OK, I know you, and I know when you get uncomfortable.
And it's so rare that I have formed an acute discomfort detector on you.
Are you gonna tell me what it is, or are you gonna force me to be late to my own annoying friend's
Louis L'Amour goddamn Western-themed wedding?
Kimberly, let's not do this.
This is paranoia.
Hey.
Kim.
Look at me.
Keep looking.
You're right.
You're right.
There's something I've been wanting to tell you.
In the dream, I told you I wanted to be with you, you to leave Jack and walk out the door with me.
- (RUMBLING)
- Wow.
Do you feel that?
What?
OK.
Calm down.
Maybe you just need some air.
Let's go up to the rooftop.
So, what else happens in this dream?
Do I...
Do I go with you, all happily ever after and the like?
Or do I slap you and tell you, "Begone"?
I don't know, actually.
We were looking at each other.
And I went to kiss you, and before our lips touched, I woke up.
- (RUMBLING)
- KIMBERLY:
What?
Maybe I never saved you that night we met.
Maybe you did die hit by that car and this... is just some afterlife fantasy playing out in your head.
- KIMBERLY:
What?
- DELL:
Something feels weird.
KIMBERLY:
Remember how you used to love flipping the pillow over to feel the cool side?
Yeah.
That's what our relationship felt like.
Constant tossing and turning, looking for that perfect balance.
Sometimes it was there.
And other times...
I know.
I know.
You always expected us to break up.
Why was that?
Is that 'cause of your dumb five-minutes-from-now rule?
After we stopped talking, the five-minute rule started shrinking.
Went... went to four minutes, then three... ..then two, then one.
KIMBERLY:
Let's go up to the rooftop.
Come on!
I thought my unconscious was trying to tell me something - you know, by dreaming that dream a few nights ago, coming here and talking to you,
I might close the gap that... that last minute.
Or...
Or none of this is really happening.
This could still be your dream.
Dun-dun-dun!
- (RUMBLING) - (TYRES SQUEAL)
- Oh, crap!
- What?
What happened?
Fucking bird carcass on my windshield.
What?
OK.
Slow down.
Tell me what's going on.
I'm saying a fucking bird just committed suicide on my windshield.
What?
In the middle of our conversation?
What does our conversation have to do with anything?
It must mean something.
It must mean that... that... that...
Maybe the bird was commenting on our situation.
Commenting?
- You think this is commentary?
- Definitely!
I mean...
Something - the universe, cosmos, all that, via the bird - sent us a signal, yeah.
OK.
I want you to listen to me very, very carefully, OK?
OK.
You're gonna be mean, aren't you?
On this already horrible call, you're gonna be mean on top of it.
You are very, very, very...
You know what, I can't even say 'very' enough.
So just imagine an infinite number of 'very's.
OK?
Well, I don't have that kind of imagination.
I can barely picture odd-numbered things.
Well, freaking try, OK?
'Cause that number of 'very's precedes sick, sick.
S-I-C-K.
Told you you were gonna be mean, and condescending, as if I didn't already know how to spell 'sick'.
You are not being a nice person right now!
(SIGHS)
So...
I'm at the gun range.
This is a nightmare.
Sartre was right.
- Hell is other people.
- (SIGHS) I should go.
I've got my goggles on.
You did this on purpose, didn't you?
You wanted me to find out when I was 3,000 miles away.
You were telegraphing all the signs like you were Samuel-fucking-Morse.
You wanted me to know.
That's the part that hurts the most.
Why would I want that?
'Cause maybe your feelings for him are real.
How long has it been going on?
- About a month.
- A month?
!
Oh, shit.
I'm so sorry for interrupting the honeymoon period.
Hear those are the best parts of a relationship.
I'm gonna go, OK?
I've got my goggles on.
Yes, I fucking heard you!
Enough with the goggles already!
Jesus Christ!
How are you gonna get off the phone and just go about your day after this, huh?
'Cause I don't think all of our conversations need to necessarily feel good!
They should feel bad, then?
They should be whatever the conversation should...
I don't know!
Why are you analysing this so much?
Oh, I'm not analysing it yet.
I'm just giving you my initial gut reaction.
Can I please get off the phone with you and not feel like shit?
You hurt me!
(THUNDER RUMBLES)
You really hurt me this time, Kimberly.
I want to break up with you.
I don't love you.
No.
That's not what you want to say.
(PHONE BEEPS)
That is what I want to say, actually.
I don't...
I don't love you, Kimberly.
Honestly, I don't know if I ever really did.
You definitely didn't.
If you're capable of making choices that knowingly hurts the other person, that's not love.
OK.
You're mad.
You're mad.
You...
How can you say that?
Reality is I could have met any number of girls to be with for a few years.
(PHONE BEEPS)
That was your lie.
Alright?
Texting Jack behind my back.
It came when I least expected it.
And I fell for it hook, line and sinker.
And it fucking hurts.
That was your lie.
- Bravo.
- OK!
Fine.
You want to hurt me?
You want to be right?
Fine.
Go ahead.
Be right.
All I ever wanted was the truth.
No.
No.
You want to be right.
Truth is not what you're after, because if you wanted the truth, then you would have to accept the fact that I do... (CALL ENDS)
(PHONE BUZZES)
Who is this?
WOMAN:
I'm sorry.
Is this Dell?
- Who's this?
- Yes.
Hi.
This is Nancy.
I'm your mother's nurse.
- We met a few times.
- Yeah.
I'm really sorry to have to tell you this.
Your mother passed away.
What?
It's impossible.
She's been OK for years now.
Her cancer's been in remission.
She had a heart attack.
Heart attack?
Why?
Sometimes these things just happen.
KIMBERLY:
This feels strange.
Not what I expected my train ride to feel like at all.
What were you expecting?
I was expecting to read that short story.
The... the Roald Dahl one?
You... you already read it.
You know the ending.
Sometimes it's not about knowing the ending.
It can't be the same like it was last time.
It has to be different or we'll wind up right where we started.
I know.
I know.
I promise you I'll change.
I promise, OK?
You know I'm falling out of love with you, right?
Just shut up for a second, please.
(SIGHS)
What do you want to tell me, Dell?
Kimberly...
I used to find it really annoying that you said 'so' all the time.
Bugged the shit out of me.
And I...
I love it.
I love it now.
After we have sex and you shrug your shoulders and you say, "I'm here all week,"
love that.
I love that a single strand of your hair can fall so perfectly to the side and you don't even know.
I love the little blue veins behind your eyes.
- (SNIFFLES)
- I love your eyes.
Knowing you goes down as easily the best thing that's ever happened to me.
Easily.
If I were a restaurant, you'd be my special, but nobody could order you, 'cause I'd just want you to be mine, just all mine.
Not in, like, a biblical slavery-owning sense or a pimp-prostitute dynamic of "You be mine, bitch,"
but... but just in that...
you're my love.
- You're my love.
- (SIGHS)
But my favourite thing of all... ..I like you 'cause you like me.
I don't know - I think that says a lot about how great you are as a person.
So, um...
Dell.
Believe me.
Believe me when I say... ..you almost had me.
(DOOR OPENS)
DELL:
Isn't it weird to imagine that one day, this'll all be old to us?
This walk, us meeting.
Just be an old memory.
This sounds... ..sad.
Hey.
I gotta...
I gotta ask you a really big question.
I don't know if you can handle it since it... it's really big.
What?
- Forget it.
It's stupid.
- What?
Forget it.
Stupid joke.
You can probably even figure it by now.
- Why would I know the joke?
- Because I've already said it.
- When?
- Earlier in the conversation.
When?
Hey.
Come on.
I'm so confused.
Sometimes I want to stop people in the streets.
- Who?
- Anybody, all walks of life.
On the way to work, to the gym, to school.
- Grab them, like you right now.
- Right now?
Right now - look right into their eyes and I want to ask them one simple question.
"Where's my fucking money?"
(SIGHS) I think I'm gonna fall in love with you too.
- Are you crying?
- Shut up.
KIMBERLY:
There's still my theory, that this is just...
part of that strange dream.
And so... even if we do kiss, you'll just wake up and it'll all be over.
- DELL:
This can't be a dream.
- KIMBERLY:
What if it is?
What are you doing?
Something's wrong.
I know it, Kimberly.
I know you.
You have circles under your eyes.
You were the type of girl that could sleep through wars.
In spite that, you're still looking so beautiful - more beautiful than ever, in fact.
It's usually a sign you want to remind the world that you're a sexual being, 'cause your man's not picking up the signal.
You've checked out of this relationship, haven't you?
You're not happy.
Also, you're listening to Roxette, and I know that means the beginning of the end.
And let's get real for a second about the ring, alright?
You're not having it sized.
I'm sure you had your ring size burned into Jack's memory years ago.
Fuck, I still remember it.
4.5.
You don't wear the ring 'cause you didn't want me to see it.
Don't marry him, OK?
I want you back.
And I know you want me back too.
That's why I'm here.
That's what you've been wanting to say to me this whole time.
- Dell?
- What?
I'm pregnant.
What?
The morning sickness has been keeping me up.
I just really love Roxette.
And I dress this way not to announce to the world anything.
It was you.
I wanted to look good for you.
'Cause no matter how bad our relationship got,
I wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for it.
Because I needed it.
I needed you in this life.
That's what I wanted to say.
I gotta...
I gotta sit down.
I'm sorry.
I'm not leaving Jack.
I love him.
Wow.
You're pregnant.
I didn't see that coming.
Do you know what it is yet?
Not yet.
Hoping it's a girl.
Uh...
I almost proposed to you, you know.
When we were in that hotel room in Paris.
I even picked out the ring.
I had it with me.
I was about to give it to you.
I took it, and...
I flushed it down the toilet.
(SIGHS) I keep replaying that moment over and over again in my head.
I...
Why are you crying?
I'm just happy to see you.
And it's such a beautiful night.
I feel like I'm in the wrong world.
'Cause I don't...
I don't belong in a world where we don't end up together, I don't.
There are parallel universes out there where this didn't happen.
Where I was with you and you were with me.
And whatever universe that is, that's the one that my heart lives in.
I wanted so badly to go back into that dream
I had the other night.
I... tried so hard to go back to sleep.
You know, I never thought love was real.
I didn't.
And now I think life isn't real without it.
And that sounds like a really bad greeting card.
Don't.
Don't make it a joke.
Truth?
I think you always believed in love.
(SCOFFS) This is so stupid.
So irrational.
Why am I so hell-bent on getting you back?
You fucking hate Pixar movies, for crying out loud.
You still have an AOL account.
I don't want to be with a person like that.
Why does it feel so impossible to let you go?
It's an addiction, you know?
That's all it is.
It's a biochemical addiction.
It's so stupid.
If you think about it, relationships are all totally narcissistic, 'cause basically, you're just looking for someone who will love you as much as you love yourself.
- That's all it is.
- No, it's not!
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.
No, it's not.
I don't know anything anymore.
But I know I do love you.
- Dell?
- Just... give me a minute, OK?
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC BUILDS)
Thisisnotadream.
This is not a dream.
Okay.
Okay.
This is not a dream.
This is not a dream.
This is not a dream.
Not a dream.
How did I get here?
I don't know.
Somebody just transferred me here.
I don't wanna give you my information again.
I just told someone 5 times.
Can one of you behave like a real person, please?
I'm calling about..
Right, yes, I'm her son.
What kind of cancer are we talking about?
What are our options?
What about a liver transplant?
Why not?
Ask about her Child-Pugh score.
Trust me.
What's her Child-Pugh score?
B. Uh..
What about her bilirubin levels?
If they're low enough, they might consider yttrium-90.
Hold on.
You have really bad social skills.
Can you pretend to not listen to my conversation?
Nobody likes that guy.
Don't be that guy.
Eyes on the prize.
Yeah.
What about yttrium-90?
Her bilirubin levels are too high.
Okay, listen.
I'm gonna get on a flight in the morning.
Uh, so I should be at the hospital by 3.
Just have her call me tonight, so I know I'm wanted.
Thanks.
Fuck.
This is about your mom?
Yeah.
How long are they giving her?
I don't know, a few years.
I'm so sorry.
Yeah.
What are you doing?
I gotta roll a joint before the meteor shower starts.
Why?
We're about to watch a fucking meteor shower. "Why."
Oh, here.
That's for when you apply to college in a few years.
Use me as a reference.
You're a postdoctoral scientist at Tristana Pharmaceuticals.
Yup.
So you already knew...
Oh, that cancery stuff, yeah, I did.
Anyway, I should be able to help you get you into a top ten pre-med in a few years.
What makes you think I wanna go pre-med?
Well, other than the fact that you know what yttrium-90 is when most of your peers are still battling to crack the mysteries of parallel parking.
That's just because my mom...
Your mom died of liver cancer.
Yeah, I know.
Your book bag has a cancer ribbon pinned to what could only be a picture of your mom.
She fits the age range.
And you guys have the same nose bridge.
Makes sense you wanting to become a doctor that saves people.
Right?
To make up for the doctor that couldn't save your mom.
Then, with time, those good intentions will fade and it'll become about the money like it always does.
And you'll become bitter, like everyone always becomes.
And then you die, probably from cancer.
You know, because that's ironic.
Is there something wrong with you?
Probably, yeah.
Don't worry, I'm working on it.
I just fired my therapist.
She was such an idiot though.
She diagnosed me with narcissistic personality disorder.
She said I'm under the grand delusion that I'm the smartest person in the world.
To which I responded, "What if I really am?"
You know?
Hey, over here.
Watch out!
You okay?
You alright?
This... this doesn't feel real.
What?
I feel like my life just flashed before my eyes, you know, like in a movie where the main character dies in the beginning but he keeps going, not realizing he's dead.
Hey, what's that movie I'm talking about?
You know what I mean.
It's like, um..
What is it?
It's..
Oh, um, sure, uh, yeah.
Like, uh, Bruce Willis in "The Sixth Sense?"
Exactly.
Yeah.
Wait, no.
You know what, I never saw that.
Shit.
That's the twist that everyone was talking about?
Bruce Willis dies in the beginning of that.
That sucks.
Ah, I really wanted to see that.
Fuck.
I'm sorry.
I guess I just thought everyone had seen it.
No, don't worry.
Now, I'm not that mad.
I mean I am, but I'll get over it.
That's a lie.
I'll probably harbor this for a few months at least and then, you know, we'll see.
See what happens.
Oh, that's cute.
Do you have an eating problem?
Oh, not like..
Sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.
Dude, come on, you do realize my date isn't the one with the eating problem, right?
Oh.
Wha..
Uh-oh, Kimberly's annoyed.
Kimberly.
Kimberly.
Hey.
How do you do that?
What?
I haven't seen you in a year when I was literally just thinking about you.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Becauseof thatsong.
I was listening to it as I was walking here.
It reminded me of the hotel.
The one we stayed at for my friend's wedding in Paris.
Yeah, yeah, Paris.
City of Lights and pretension as I recall.
We had one of our biggest fights.
And that was your friend's wedding from Wisconsin, right?
What was her name, Lenora or Lee Anora?
Sarah?
Right.
Irememberthatwedding.
I remember that was the one where the DJ played that Montell Jordan song twice.
I remember, the first time we thought it was ironic then we realized he just liked the song.
Definitely our biggest fight.
The beginning of the end, really.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Look, It's like the Beatles, right?
I mean, I liked them when I was 5.
But at a certain point, you just want something with a little more nuance, you know?
Don't get me wrong.
I could handle them a little better when they had Pete Best to ground them but past that, I don't know, they just got so pedestrian.
Do you come here a lot?
DoI cometo thecemetery?
I like cemeteries.
You know, they're romantic.
Especially this one.
Soccer is by far the most elegant sport.
Yeah, I read somewhere it's gonna overtake football in America in the next 2 years.
Really?
2 years?
A friend of mine described it.
Clock's ticking.
He blogged, "Soccer's...
soccer's chess on a field."
Do you have a vomit bag...
vomit bags on you?
I'llsendyouthe link.
I guess we could just..
I'd hate to throw up on a grave.
Why didn't you just go to the Griffith Park Observatory then to watch the meteor shower?
Oh, they have assholes there too.
Trust me.
There're assholes all over the city
But rarely do you get to be next to one so spectacular.
The only knock on him though, I have to say, is that he's from New York.
I can't stand that place.
Seriously.
It's so overrated.
Why?
Because of all the bridges and the culture and the history they have?
Who needs it?
I'll take Orlando any day.
They got so many more T.G.I. Fridays.
Do I love L.A.?
You know, Los Angeles is just more modern.
It has a certain relevancy about it
New York just doesn't have anymore.
Kimberly, I was wondering if I could have your number?
What?
Your phone number?
Dude... she's with me.
No.
Uh, yeah, she is.
No,she'snot.
Not yet anyway.
At best, this is a first date.
And I'm shocked that that even happened.
I have nothing against you.
You might not be a bad guy.
Most likely you are but maybe not.
You're incredibly handsome and you were probably very handsome when you were a kid, too.
I think that explains your lack of substance and personality.
Only because nobody's ever really challenged you before.
So now as an adult you think everything you say means something, but it means nothing actually.
You don't know what you're talking about.
And it's really upsetting.
And I think she probably sees through that.
You're very pretty, but you're shallow beyond belief.
Anyway, can I have your number?
Okay, okay.
Whatareyoudoing?
You just said all that shit.
Yeah, but it was just an observation.
And you ask my girl out in front of me?
Oh, shit.
Sorry, my mistake.
I see that now.
I shouldn't have done that.
She's way too beautiful.
What?
No.
I just should be more of a realist.
I should know that I'm a C, maybe a C plus in the winter time when I can cover up my body more.
And even though you're a douche bag, you're still incredibly attractive.
So maybe it's only fair you two pair.
What?
It rhymed.
She'sright,it rhymed.
Let's..
Can you just put me down?
This is embarrassing now for everyone.
Okay.
Come on, Josh.
The line's moving.
Let's...
Let's just go.
Come on.
Oh,yeah..
Gotta get a good seat.
The only thing wrong with you is you're chicken shit.
That's all.
That's not the only problem.
Let'sgo.
Excuseme.
Excuse me.
One of many.
You okay?
Yeah.
I shouldn't have talked.
That's when I get into trouble.
I'm sorry I made fun of your sandwich bag.
I didn't mean to.
Actually, that's not true, I did.
Sorry.
I'm really nervous.
It's okay.
I'm sorry he bothered you.
I was not nervous because of him.
Okay.
Bye.
She is so..
Beautiful.
Kim, come on, the wedding's in an hour.
You gotta get ready.
So... have you ever dreamt about me?
Dreamt about you?
Yeah.
You know, in the 700 plus days we've dated.
You ever dreamt about me?
So...
Yeah, of course.
Oh, yeah?
Like, uh, sex dreams?
At first, but then we had sex, and that went away.
Ha.
Is that how you really wanna say that?
So I was all hot to trot for you or whatever in the beginning.
And now, you know, reality has set in.
But that's not what I meant.
I meant like..
A dream, like ambiguous depictions of what we are or were, or could be.
Stuff like that.
Can you stop already?
I got it.
Why, I oughta..
Oh,hey,whoo.
Put that down.
You're gonna hurt yourself.
What are you doing?
I'ma giveyouwhatfor.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
You good?
Okay.
Okay.
That was fun.
Does it bother you that you don't make me happy?
Always with the jokes.
I'mserious.
Seriously?
You went from sex dreams to not being happy?
False.
I wasn't talking about sex dreams, you were.
And secondly, I'm a girl, so yes, we non-sequitur.
That's a little cliched.
Iwantababy.
Point taken.
Seriously.
Don't you want a baby?
Someday, sure.
But let's burn that bridge when we get to it, okay?
See?
Not making me happy.
How do you do that?
How do you do that?
Oh, my God.
She's beautiful.
She's beyond beautiful.
And she's real.
She seems funny, too.
And there's a hint of crazy, I can feel it.
Beautiful, crazy, and funny.
Jesus Christ.
She's perfect.
It's really annoying.
Really..
That's two near collisions for you now in a row.
Well, at least this one's nonfatal.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye.
Uh, yeah.
What the fuck was that?
Wait.
Wait.
What are we doing?
Are we in a chase scene now?
What are we doing?
Wait, just stop for a second.
So I thought I saw somebody, a friend of mine behind you coming over.
So that's why I turned around and waited.
So what's the big deal?
It wasn't because you were watching me?
Because it looked like you were kinda watching me.
No, it was because of a friend that was behind you.
So they're not there now obviously.
Besides, you were being weird.
You were talking to yourself.
What were you saying anyway?
You say "so" a lot.
It's really annoying.
So..
Are you trying to make this awkward now?
It feels awkward now.
Awkwardfeelsgoodtome.
And awkward feels awkward to me.
That's a little on the nose, don't you think?
I'm not trying to fuck you.
If that's what you're worried about, I mean.
I'm not gonna ask you out because I don't believe in love.
I think all relationships deteriorate into hate indifference or..
Well, yeah, those two things.
My parents have been together for 32 years.
And they're happily in love.
No,they'renot.
Yes, they are.
No,they'renot.
If they haven't divorced by now probably means they've just surrendered to the fact that being apart isn't much better than being together.
You know, the lesser of two evils.
Trust me, it's like an emotional holocaust between your parents right now.
They probably have lukewarm feelings about you too.
I'm Dell, by the way.
So, no offense, but I have a-a thing about shaking hands.
Oh, my God.
You are a little crazy.
That's great.
You're not impressing me.
Idisagree.
You know, you should stop trying to sound so smart all the time.
You just wind up sounding really dumb.
It's just I realized why you date guys like that.
You have terrible taste in men because you're superficial.
You're fooling yourself in the hopes of finding something redeemable.
It's because of love.
That's your blind spot.
You gotta give up on that.
Wow.
Okay.
Well, I thank you for your insight, stranger but I actually believe love is real.
I'm gonna go now.
Wait.
Can I still get your..
Hello, boyfriend.
Hey.
Hey, listen, Roxette's on, and the good part is coming up.
Can I call you back?
Wait-wait, I just have to tell you something more important really quick.
You know that book I've been reading, "The Selfish Gene" by Richard Dawkins... ¶ Leave the winter on the ground ¶
There's this fascinating part I just read about memes.
He basically says that ideas are like genes that self-replicate and mutate like a cultural form of evolution... ¶ Touch me now I close my eyes... ¶
I was thinking how that applies to us, you know?
The idea of us, how we've really mutated and evolved... ¶ And it's a hard winter's day... ¶
Right?
because you think about it, we were just dumb, young kids when we first met.
And then we broke up, got back together, blah blah blah.
And now, we're this really mature, loving couple who's grown respect and admiration for each other.
You know what I mean?
Kimberly?
You hung up on me, didn't you?
¶ But it's over now ¶
¶ From the moment we touched ¶
¶ Until the time had run out ¶
¶ Yeah ¶¶
Well, maybe you could.
Well, because I'd like her to be at the best place.
Well, then maybe you can introduce me to the head guy at the cancer immunology lab.
Because I've taken an interest, that's all.
Yes, mom, I meditated.
I meditate before every date, but it didn't help.
Face facts, no one thinks I'm special but you.
Well, I'm still technically on it.
But it's not working out, trust me.
He called himself a Bob Dylan song and then proceeded to call me a Britney Spears song.
I don't know what it means either, but it sounds insulting.
No, not him.
Uh, the one with glasses, mustache.
Looks like a child trafficker.
Yeah, yeah, that's the one.
Well, if I..
I gotta go.
I gotta go.
Can I ask you a serious question?
Do you think I have terrible taste in men?
Okay, I'm back.
Uh-huh.
Well, I'm at...
Ihaveto talktoyou.
I'm on the phone.
No,it'sreallyimportant.
Really important.
I'monthefriggin'phone.
Have you ever cried at one of these things?
I was wondering.
Mom, I have to go.
Something weird is happening.
One of what things?
Thesemeteorshowerthings.
Cried?
Yeah, you know, like tears of joy, that kind of thing.
No.
I've never cried at one of these things.
Neither have I. Ever, ever.
In fact, I don't understand people that do.
It's kind of bullshit, happy crying is, isn't it?
What are your thoughts on that?
So I was on the phone.
So, yeah, you were on the phone.
Sorry.
Was it important?
More important than your question?
Yes.
Yes.
My mistake.
Sorry.
I'll never interrupt you again.
Thank you.
Okay.
Well..
I should get back to my date.
He's probably...
But I just wanna keep talking to you.
What?
I wanna keep talking to you for multiple reasons.
I mean, you're beautiful, but it's more than that.
I promise.
That's very nice, but I should go.
Maybe I'll see you in the winter when you're a C plus.
See?
I knew it.
I knew you were superficial.
I told you.
The only reason that you're talking to me is because you think I'm hot.
Yeah, but the only reason why you won't is because you think I'm not.
Fine.
Give me a reason why I should?
I was saying, "Don't miss her."
Earlier, when you saw me talking to myself.
I was saying, "Don't miss her."
I'm always so afraid I'm gonna miss the important things in life.
Something about you has given me a heightened curiosity to know you better.
And that is a near impossible feat when it comes to me because I hate getting to know people.
But I can tell you're not like the others.
What others?
People.
People?
You can tell I'm not a person?
Yeah, you're not phony like them.
Also, I didn't say you were hot.
I said you are beautiful.
When is this dumb thing gonna happen?
It's a beautiful night though.
What?
I never know what that means when people say that it's a beautiful night?
What does it mean?
So... well, to me means it's comfortable, familiar..
Yet deeply moving.
Right, no...
I feel you like, uh, like getting stoned and listening to Steely Dan.
No.
Nothing at all like that.
No...
I know.
More like..
Yeah, like..
Floating down a serene lake in a rowboat when the sun is setting or rising... or when the sun is being a part of nature.
Stop speaking.
Okay.
It's beautiful when the weather is not hot or cold.
Kinda like you don't notice it.
Kinda like it's perfect because everything is so balanced.
You don't even feel it.
And while you're feeling that non-feeling you look up in the sky and you almost think that's why.
Because how everything is right now, all the stars and planets and us and the ground, and the cells and molecules right now... is exactly the reason why now is comfortable.
You're a now person.
True.
Yeah, see, I'm a 5-minutes-from-now person.
Because 5 minutes from now, a gust of wind could come in and blow H1N1 in everyone's eyes.
Right.
Except that's highly unlikely.
Or 5 minutes from now, an earthquake could erupt and swallow us all whole.
Right.
Except that..
No, shit, that could actually happen.
Yeah.
The point is I'm way too anxious about what could happen 5 minutes from now to be content with now.
Can't do it.
What if something good happens 5 minutes from now?
Can't that happen?
No.
What did you think was gonna happen 5 minutes before you met me?
I'm just really paranoid I'm gonna miss it.
I miss things a lot.
I don't care if I miss it because...
You're a now person.
Got it.
So another weird thing.
I don't mind your pessimism as much as I usually mind pessimism.
That's great.
I hate people who think I'm too negative.
Also, I like your hat.
Yeah, I'm probably gonna fall in love with you.
Wow.
That's it?
What were you hoping for?
I'm going to fall in love with you, too?
No, but..
Well, yeah.
So all that stuff about not believing in relationships...
Oh, that's just a pick-up line.
Do we have a deal then?
'Cause you said you believe in love.
I don't.
Let's put it to the test.
Date each other.
Me and you.
In a relationship.
Let's do it.
Why the hell am I shaking your hand?
I should be scared to death of who you are as a person.
Instead, I'm scared to death of weddings.
Death.
Literally.
I'd probably have a coronary right as I'm walking up the aisle.
Oh, God, please invite me to your wedding.
I would love to see that.
Well, that's morbid and telling.
Yeah, well, if snuff films were readily available
I'd probably watch them, not gonna lie.
Is that a deal breaker for you?
No, because for some reason
I still happen to be in love with you.
No, it's because you didn't think that you'd be the one marrying me.
You don't smoke weed.
What are you doing?
Don't do that.
Sodoyoustilllove me?
I tell you all the time, if you died right now
I'd visit your grave every single day.
Not every day, that's crazy.
Thatdoesn'tanswer the question.
Of course, I love you.
Itneversoundsreal when you say it.
Like it doesn't exist.
So what are you doing here?
Going up north.
Whywouldyoudothat ?
I don't know.
Youdon'tknow?
I'm...
I'm kidding.
I'm going to meet someone.
So right, okay.
How's your mom doing?
She'sactuallyfine.
I can't believe I haven't talked to you this long.
Yeah, turns out her doctors are huge idiots.
So I kinda took matters in my own hand.
I figured out a way to dose her with that experimental drug we've been developing in our lab.
Wait.
Are you allowed to do that?
No.
Wasn't that extremely dangerous?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
She'sfinenow?
Yeah, completely.
She's in remission.
So..
Dell, that's great.
Yeah.
I mean, other than the totally-unethical-recklessly- risking-your-mom's-life part.
That's... that's, You... you saved her.
Yeah, I guess.
We should probably keep that between us... by the way
Because there's a good chance what I did was illegal... ish.
Right.
Oh.
All aboard.
Right.
We should probably..
Okay, right.
Well, still, wow.
I can't believe you're curing cancer now.
Does that mean you've stopped hating people?
Not at all.
Kill Zelda Fitzgerald.
Right?
Who is that?
Really?
Idon'tknowwho thatis.
F. Scott Fitzgerald's annoying... wife.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Oh.
I'd definitely marry Rita Hayworth.
Great hair.
Hair, right.
Guys love her hair.
I definitely have to shit out of this one.
Olga Kordinstitch?
Who is that?
I don't know.
I've just always wanted to fuck an Olga.
I would definitely marry Tupac.
Kimberly Shakur.
It's got a good ring to it.
I would definitely "F" Edward R. Murrow.
I picture him starting up sex with
"Good night, and good luck."
I'd probably laugh so much that I'd have an orgasm right then and there.
From the laughter, you know?
I lied about not seeing "The Sixth Sense."
Of course I saw it.
Everybody saw it.
It's amazing.
Who didn't see "The Sixth Sense?"
Why would you lie about that?
I read in a woman's magazine that every relationship whether it be short term, or long term there's usually, like, one big lie relative to that relationship and I just..
I wanted to get mine over with, I guess.
Why would you want to get a jump start on the lying?
Because...
Because of five minutes from now.
Well, yeah...
You're assuming that we're in a relationship or going to be when I'm still technically on a date with someone else.
Which I should probably be getting back to. by the way.
What about the handshake?
We shook hands.
You can't do that.
I was leading you on.
That's really fucked up.
That's the business.
Well, what about a friendship?
Actually, what am I talking about?
I definitely don't want to be friends with you.
I was raped.
In high school.
By the quarterback...
of the football team.
Jesus.
I know.
That is a terrible lie.
Hey!
How do you know that's a lie?
You were raped in high school by the quarterback of the football team?
I don't think after-school specials are that cliched.
You couldn't have gone with, like, a cornerback or defensive end or something?
Well, I was just trying to get mine over with.
- Get what over who?
- My lie to you.
- You can't.
- Why can't?
Because I saw it coming, because we just talked about it.
You've got to wait until I'm in a completely vulnerable position where I'd really fall for it.
That sounds really dangerous.
Oh, yeah, that's the problem with relationships.
Danger?
- Or worse.
- Worse?
You could change the other person.
You're a very broken man, Dell.
In theory.
Speaking of broken men, your goateed Philistine 'is sashaying towards us.'
- Run!
- What?
- Run!
- What?
'Run!
'
Well, that's settled.
Wanna hit?
No way.
It has a weird effect on me.
For some reason, when I'm high, I think people can't hear me and I start speaking really loudly.
Do you remember memorizing phone numbers?
I don't remember the last time I memorized a phone number.
I don't either, actually.
Remember checking the newspaper for movie showtimes?
Remember that?
Or writing people those notes in those, like, folded-up triangles and then putting them in their lockers.
Do you think kids still do that?
As opposed to just e-mails or texts?
No way.
It's all about e-mails and texts with those goddamn hugs and kisses.
I hate those things.
Whenever anybody e-mails me hugs and kisses
I wanna just e-mail them back oral and penetration.
Are we old?
Are we talking like old people?
Are we on the verge of joining the sweatpants culture?
Was I just saying something?
What?
Was I?
Give me that.
- Why?
- Give me that.
Okay, that's it for you.
I think you should start drinking some coffee.
Okay?
See, that's why I hate time.
I believe I want to have sex with you now.
I believe I share in that belief.
Hey, uh, uh...
Okay.
We gotta get ready.
Come on.
What the F?
I thought we were gonna make it!
I know, but we gotta go, Kim.
Really.
What's that?
What is that?
'You ordered Chinese food?
Who orders Chinese food in Paris?
'
Kim, they're going to have dinner at the wedding, you know?
'The wedding that we're supposed to go to in half an hour.'
'And you just ate lunch.
You're not full?
'
What does that have to do with anything?
Oh, Jesus.
This is the pot talking.
You shouldn't have smoked.
I knew it.
You gotta get ready.
What are you doing?
You made me promise to get you down there on time no matter what.
You warned me you would do this.
See, this is why I hate time.
I can't enjoy my sesame chicken because of it.
Kim.
'Wish I could just stop it or something.'
Or at least just make it pause when needed, like now.
Or better yet, just get rid of it altogether.
You wanna get rid of time?
How would you do that?
'You know how there's time-based art?
'
Movies, music, plays, it's all time-based art.
There's a beginning, and a middle and an end.
You have to see it from the beginning to the end.
You're restrained to that timeline..
'That way of experiencing it.'
But then there's paintings.
No beginning, no middle, no end.
You see what you want to see when you want to see it.
No restrictions, it's just there.
Okay, so you want life to be a painting?
Great.
What?
Thanks.
So, do you know you really love me?
So, what's in your pocket?
My wallet.
It's stuffed with our saved movie ticket stubs because I'm a romantic like that.
Can you please get ready?
Shhh!
Can't you see, I'm trying to touch my toes?
I really don't want to be that couple that's always late for things.
Can we please not be that couple?
At least for the tenure of our relationship?
Please.
You did it again!
What?
What, I'm just saying I want us to respect time.
'Not that.'
Okay, what then?
What did I do that I did twice now and still not know?
You said "the tenure of our relationship."
You keep speaking about our relationship as if it's ending.
Okay.
You see how this relates to the time thing?
Why don't you take your own advice and instead of seeing a beginning, middle, and end, just see it as a painting.
Kimberly!
What are you doing?
We're going to be late!
And I'm gonna somehow get blamed for it, I know it.
What are you reading?
Roald Dahl short stories.
So, is it about a girl?
Is it about a new girl you're going up north?
A new girlfriend you're not telling me because you think it'll make it awkward...
Yeah.
So, right.
Okay.
New girl.
I love Roald Dahl.
He's the best.
Which one are you reading?
And are you sleeping with anyone?
The one about Hitler.
And yes.
Shit.
I didn't know he wrote one about Hitler.
Uh... kind of.
It's about this doctor that saves this woman's life.
'She's on the verge of death through the whole delivery.'
And this doctor is so determined to save this woman's life and the life of her unborn child, right?
But, it turns out that the child is Hitler.
Okay, uh..
Did you just give away the ending?
How was I supposed to tell you what the story was about without giving away the ending?
What are you talking about?
Just say..
It's a story about a doctor who saves a woman from a potentially fatal pregnancy?
Because that's what the story is about.
Itis.
False, birdbrain.
That is not what the story is about.
It's about the irony that the baby's Hitler.
- Okay, you're mad.
- I'm not mad.
- You're mad 'cause of the girl.
- I'm seeing a guy.
Jack.
You're seeing a Jack?
'He's an executive at MTV.'
Looks like a cross between Salvador Dali and Dwayne Wayne from "A Different World," which is hot.
That's a weird combination.
I gotta go to the bathroom really quick.
Well, that... fucking..
Hurt.
What?
You hung up on me.
What happened?
Because.
Okay, you realize that's not an answer to my question, right?
What is it that I can help you with, sir?
I don't know.
Have I told you how much New York reminds of why I hate L.A. so much?
No, please do, because the New Yorker who opines the inferiorities of Los Angeles is bursting with originality.
'I'm serious, Kimberly' we gotta move here, it is the fucking best.
It's enough already with L.A.
It's like a mix of moral nihilism and Disneyland.
So are you.
Hey, did I tell you the proof of concept on our drug passed with flying colors?
There's actually a bidding war between a few pharmas right now.
Looks like we could be licensing it for close to 25 million.
Money for soul seems like...
An even swap, yes, it's not like I'm not happy for you but you did already tell me this all this morning, remember?
- Did I really?
- Uh-huh.
Oh shit, my short-term memory must be shot.
What with the smoking pot and whatnot.
I'm your new second-term girlfriend, man aren't you supposed to be, like, impressing me still?
Your second-term boyfriend just told you he made his bosses close to 25 million dollars today.
I'm not materialistic.
I know that, but 25 million dollars sort of, I don't know, makes that sound retarded.
Okay, seeing as there's no new information in this call
I am going to go.
I'm almost at the gun range.
Hey, don't you think it's cute that you own a gun card and I own a pot card?
'Now you sound retarded.'
Listen, we should probably stop saying retarded.
I'm starting to feel like an asshole.
Oh, is that just now starting?
What's going on?
You sound off.
You're off.
'No, no, no, I'm serious.'
'Your cadence is all over the place.'
You sound a little like Miss Teschmacher when she betrayed Lex Luthor.
Something's wrong, I can tell.
What's going on?
Oh, God, this is gonna blow.
What's going on?
Oh, shit, this is bad, isn't it?
This is like infidelity bad.
I definitely heard a silence just now!
What is going on?
!
You okay?
Yeah, you okay?
So... it's been a while.
Yup.
I'm glad you're finally here.
Yeah,metoo.
I've been trying to get a hold of you for a long time now.
Do you want a tour of the place?
No.
Oh, okay.
Seriously?
Oh, yeah.
You know I don't care about stupid shit like that.
'Right, sorry, I've adjusted to normal people' so your presence is gonna take some realignment.
You moving?
Uh, no, kind... kind of.
Um, do you want anything, by the way?
Like, uh..
I want to talk.
What?
Nothing, for a second I..
I forgot what you looked like.
For the record, I've never forgotten what you looked like.
Okay, chill out, okay.
I didn't sleep with anyone!
Okay, did you see and/or touch another man's penis in any way?
'Really?
Out of all the things you want to know' 'this is what you wanna ask me the most?
'
What kinda question is that.
Of course that's what I want to know the most!
No.
Penises were not involved.
Were your boobs and/or vagina...
No.
It was texts.
That's all it was.
I should never have gone against my own advice.
I should always be the better looking one in the relationship but I just sort of hit an impasse on that.
Honestly, gosh, Dell, do you really think that that...
'Who was it?
'
It was my in-between ex...
Jack.
Jack, the MTV exec?
Are you fucking serious?
I thought you hated MTV!
Isn't he short?
He's not tall.
Wha..
Are you seriously defending him?
You can't call him short, you have to go with "not tall?"
Jesus, you like him?
Why the fuck are you being 'so sangfroid over this shit?
'
'You're being way too easy on yourself!
'
You should know I'm standing in the middle of a monsoon right now.
Well... so, maybe I should let you go then?
Why?
Because I'm standing in the middle of a monsoon?
No, because you...
Yes, because you're standing in the middle of a monsoon!
Um...
Are you okay?
What are you staring at?
'Oh, my thesis.'
'That reminds me.
I've been keeping articles about you.'
'They said that your drug led to major breakthroughs' 'in cancer treatment.
It's amazing, Dell.'
Your mom, especially, must be proud.
- That's me and...
- Jack.
How long have you guys been engaged?
So... what are you talking about?
You've boxed up a lot of old kitchen appliances over there which means you've either declared a fatwa on General Electric or you're wedding registering the fuck out of your friends and family.
You've been fidgeting with your ring finger non-stop.
You're also giving me that look like you're trying to think of a lie real quick.
I might beat the shit out of you.
The wedding's in a few weeks.
Question is, where's the ring?
It's getting sized.
Huh?
Question number two, why didn't you tell me?
I was going to tell you before you did your whole annoying MacGyver thing.
I don't think that's the reference you're looking for.
Does Jack even know I'm here?
Trust me, he knows you're here.
What does that mean?
Why did you scoff?
What scoff?
I didn't scoff.
You scoffed.
You guys fought about me coming.
I'm actually kind of flattered, didn't know yours truly could threaten the evil prince of the MTV generation.
First of all, Jack's leaving MTV.
His article in Esquire was optioned by George Clooney.
Yeah, well, I won my fantasy baseball league last year.
Let's not talk about Jack, okay?
I'm happy to not talk about Jack.
What's the smoking rule in here?
Is he making a face?
Is that..
That's just how he looks.
So, I had a very vivid dream the other night about us.
A vivid dream?
What was it about, this vivid dream?
Itwasadreamofmemories.
'Uh, conversations that we've had.'
'I saved your life.'
You owe the person that saved you, don't you think?
You had a dream that was really a series of memories of conversations we've had?
Yeah, don't hurt yourself, it's not that complicated.
'Cause to the brain, there's no difference between reality and dreams.
They were just memories of us over the years.
What if I don't subscribe to a culture of indentured servitude?
You can't unsubscribe.
It's a thing of nature it's here to stay.
They weaved in and out of each other like those M.C. Escher drawings.
So, one second I'd be on that train that time we got back together after our first breakup another second I was on the phone in New York.
The last time we ever talked to each other.
But they blended together like a..
'Painting?
'
I saved your life.
If it weren't for me, you would have been run over by that car.
'You would have been splat' just like my timeless life painting thing.
And they were all real..
But there was one moment in the dream that was, um..
Well, it... it...
it was one we never had, it was the only one.
'What was it about?
This made-up moment?
'
It's gonna sound weird, but it was us talking after not having talked for however long.
'So, wait, I'm confused.
It was... '
This moment.
This moment that we're having right now.
So me coming over, seeing your apartment, your life with Jack and reconnecting..
Oh, God, I feel sick.
I blame L.A. for this.
This is what happens when you fall in love in Los Angeles.
Fuck!
So, what is this?
Are you breaking up with me?
'I don't want to, no.'
But you like this Jack guy, right?
Do you realize Jack Tripper was one of my favorite characters in all of fiction and you've forever ruined his good name?
Shit!
Can I..
Shit, I can't even order a Jack and Coke anymore!
A vodka soda!
A vodka soda?
My life is ruined!
Okay.
We should just get off the phone, okay.
You're mad, and any words we exchange now are gonna be bleak at best...
I can't believe this.
You used to never want to get off the phone.
No, I used to want to get off the phone, I just used to not.
And now you can't wait to get off the phone.
I don't even know what we're fighting about anymore, okay.'
If you wanna yell at me about Jack, fine, but I'm too tired for another one of your meta arguments.
I don't deserve to be treated like this.
'I thought you were supposed to be my indentured servant?
'
'Whatever happened to that, huh?
'
So, what are you talking about right now?
'I'm talking about that-that prescription to life thing.'
Right, except it's subscription to nature.
Whatever.
No, you have this backwards, kid, I saved your life.
'But then I saved your life.'
When were on the train, we ran into each other, and we got back together.
You mean, when you stalked and followed me onto the train?
'I saved your life because you got off at Chico.'
'You weren't supposed to get off at Chico.'
You were supposed to go on to Portland, but because of me you got off at Chico instead and you weren't on the train when it derailed.
You could have died.
'No one died, Dell.'
The point remains...
No, that's not the same, okay.
You would absolutely have died had I not saved you.
Plus, I saw that car coming.
I knew it was going to hit you, and I saved you.
I knowingly saved you.
Yeah, well, that's starting to feel like a minus, not a plus.
Be that as it may, you didn't know you were saving me.
You were just trying to get back in my pants.
No!
I was trying to get you back!
Which just happens to include getting into your pants.
So yours was a sinister doing, mine was pure altruism.
But I knowingly saved you too.
We just went over this, pothead...
You were supposed to get off at Portland to meet Jack but I knowingly saved you from him.
Except I didn't, did I?
Fuck!
I should have told you I loved you more.
When we were together, I mean.
'I was also such a dick to you' but I thought you'd find it endearing for some reason like...
like people feel about Don Rickles or Mussolini.
It's not an excuse, it's just a reason.
Anyway, I'm sorry, okay.
I need a drink.
In a bad way.
There's a bar car here, they sell drinks.
Let's go.
No, doesn't that mean we have to walk in between the cars?
No, I can't do that while the train's moving.
Oh, don't be such a pussy.
Saidthedick.
Besides, the world's at war right now, so I think we should...
We should take every little opportunity to put ourselves in harm's way.
Alleviate some of the guilt, you know?
No, no, there's all the scary noises that the train makes and what if I fell?
I don't have the best relationship with gravity.
Put your iPod on and play something calming that'll drown out the sound, and I'll hold your hand.
So you don't fall.
Come on.
Come on.
I won't let you go.
I promise.

Have you ever tried asking someone
"Where's my fucking money?" You ever done that?
You mean, at random, or when I'm actually owed money?
No, at random obviously.
Right, I don't know what I was thinking.
It's fun, you should try it.
Ask me.
Ask me where's my fucking money?
Where's my fucking money?
Where's my fucking money?
Oh, no, motherfucker.
Where's my fucking money!
If I don't get my fucking money right fucking now...
Where's my goddamn money, you motherfucker?
What the fuck?
Jesus.
That was really fun.
Wait.
It's just that..
Say what you were going to say, and then, after you say it maybe we should, like, not talk for a minute.
You know, like, let a whole minute pass by without saying something.
But go ahead and say what you were gonna say and then we can start right after that.
I'm really gonna miss you tomorrow.
So, wait, you're saying you dreamt this conversation?
A conversation that didn't take place until now?
I'm saying I dreamt a bunch of conversations, including this one which led me to come here, because it made me think about how much I regretted..
Do you regret meeting me, Dell?
No, of course not.
I'm glad we dated.
I needed to date you.
Before you, I only dated guys that looked good on paper.
Yeah.
Wait, what?
You were really, really smart, but also selfish, crass..
Not always in an entertaining way, mind you.
You hated your job and life and you were completely comfortable being miserable.
You're horrible on paper.
And I loved you.
Being with you made me realize it..
Doesn't have to look good on paper to feel good.
- What kind of sandwich...
- PB and J.
Of course.
- What's your favorite word?
- Comet.
- "Comet?"
- Right.
Not like "proliferate," "ensconce"
"kerfuffle," or "serendipity."
"Comet?" Like..
"comet?"
Yeah.
Exactly like that.
What about your least favorite word?
I don't strongly dislike any word.
I sort of have a love-hate relationship with the word
"fingerfuck," but that's technically two words and I like each one separately.
So, do you ever wish you could, like, control society for a couple of minutes?
Like make them all hate MTV or something?
I don't think MTV is as important as you think it is.
You're so wrong.
MTV is so manipulative.
It's like a drug which you get hooked on at age twelve that you can't wake up from until you're probably, like, thirty when you finally realize how awful it really was.
But by then, it's too late.
They've, like, won.
You've watched all their commercials during their week's sweep.
I believe it's "sweeps week."
You don't deserve me.
I can tell.
That's perfect.
I want someone I don't deserve.
You think you've won me.
I can't believe you think you've won me already.
Are you kidding?
You ditched a much prettier man to stay with me.
I've definitely won you.
You're so wrong, my friend.
Holy shit.
You are so easily amused.
'Cause of the boots, huh?
Sarah's stupid idea.
Louis L'Amour is her favorite novelist, so, here we are.
You know I just realized.
I don't even know why we're here.
I don't even like Sarah.
Fire.
Just let me have this, and then we'll go.
What are you doing?
This feels like a dream...
I love it when you look out windows.
Sir..
Did you damage the bathroom about thirty minutes ago?
Well, I'm obviously going to tell you that I didn't.
Sir.
What?
I'm gonna have to ask you to get off at the next stop.
Don't let me find you on here after Chico.
Okay.
You got me?
Yes,sir.
I'msorry.
I don't even wanna ask.
Looks like our little tryst is about to end.
Get off at Chico with me, please.
We can have an hour to two hour talk.
And then if you want, I'll get you another ticket to Portland.
An hour to two hour talk?
That's a long time, Dell.
Well, I'm not meeting anyone so.
Wait, what?
There's no... girl.
So, wha... what was this?
Just another one of your stupid mind games, Dell?
Why did you lie?
And what happened to your hand?
You're always hiding things!
I'm sitting somewhere else.
Now, listen, wait...
No, no.
Stop, stop, stop.
I'm sorry.
I lied because I thought it'd make it easier, okay?
You thought it'd make it easier?
Yeah.
You thought it'd make what easier exactly?
Talking to you.
Whywouldit makeiteasier?
Because I didn't think you'd talk to me if you knew I was trying to get you back.
So what was this?
Is this a plan to win me back?
Yes, it was.
It was a whim that turned into a plan.
How did you even know I was on this train?
Because I've...
I've...
I've stalked you.
You could've called, Dell.
You haven't talked to me in a long time.
Iknow.
You have my phone number, you have my e-mail but you haven't contacted me once, not once in months.
Just...
Look, I know a great public library in Chico where we can talk.
We can talk about all of this.
You wanna go to a public library to talk?
That seems counter-intuitive.
Well, they have a talking area.
You happen to know of a public library in Chico with a talking area?
Yeah.
First, answer my question.
How come you never proposed?
Come on, Kim, you broke up with me.
How come you didn't fight for me?
It felt like the end of days when you left.
I ate Ramen for months.
I had a huge sodium imbalance.
I barely got through it.
I didn't think I could do it again.
Felt like my fucking world was gonna blow.
So me leaving you constitutes your world blowing up?
Yes.
It does actually.
'Next stop, Chico.'
Please, come on.
I want you to do this.
Why wouldn't you want this forever?
I'd like for once to understand why you wouldn't want this always.
It's always as scary.
There's a finality to it.
I just don't ever want you to feel like a limitation.
Okay, let me go a different way with it.
Why are girls so scared of cockroaches?
'Cause you think they're gonna hurt you even though they can't.
Just like I'm afraid "always" will hurt me.
They're both irrational.
Falseonso manyfronts.
Why?
Girls are afraid of cockroaches because they're gross and they carry disease, proven by the fact that they were one of the biblical plagues.
Also, they also love to lay eggs in your vagina.
Secondly, it's not irrational to think that commitment can hurt you..
Because it can.
Know that when a steal a girl's twenties..
It's dangerous business, buster.
You're officially on notice, Mr. Pink Lighter.
Duly noted, Mrs. Pink Lighter.
Nope,can'tcallmethat .
You don't want to marry me, remember?
I didn't say that.
Where's my phone?
Where's my phone?
Where's my fuckin' phone?
Why don't I call it?
Why are you acting like that?
Like what?
Uncomfortable.
In the two years we've known each other
I've rarely seen you uncomfortable.
'I...
I'm not.'
You are.
You're hiding something from me.
'Ah, God, you just got too stoned, Kimberly'
'And I thought we were going after your last cigarette.'
'What're you doing?
' What'reyouhiding?
You know something?
'There'sno"something."'
'You just got too high.'
You best motherfucking believe there's a something.
There's always a something.
Okay?
This is not the first time I've felt that.
'Felt what?
' You..
Saying something like you've slipped.
'I didn't slip... '
Like a cartoon character on a banana peel.
'You know what?
You're actually starting to freak me out.
There's nothing going on.'
Well, it's about time you're freaked.
Okay.
I hate always feeling like the freak in this relationship!
'Why're you doing this?
'
Because there's something you're not telling me.
Okay.
I know you, and I know when you get uncomfortable.
And it's so rare that I've formed an acute discomfort detector on you.
Now, are you gonna tell me what it is or are you going to force me to be late to my own annoying friend's Louis L'Amour goddamn western-themed wedding?
Kimberly, let's not do this.
This is paranoia.
Hey.
Kim.
Look at me.
Keep looking.
You're right.
You're right.
There is something I've been wanting to tell you.
In the dream, I told you I wanted to be with you.
I wanted you to leave Jack and to walk out the door with me.
Wow.
Do you feel that?
What?
'Okay, calm down.
Maybe you just need some air.'
'Let's go up to the rooftop.'
So, what else happens in this dream?
Do I..
Do I go with you?
All happily ever after and the like?
Or do I slap you and tell you to be gone.
I don't know, actually.
We were looking at each other and I went to kiss you and before our lips touched, I woke up.
'What?
'
'Maybe I never saved you that night we met.'
'Maybe you did die, hit by that car.'
And this is just some afterlife fantasy playing out in your head.
What?
Something feels weird.
Remember how I used to love flipping the pillow over to feel the cold side?
Yeah.
That's what our relationship felt like.
Constant tossing and turning looking for that perfect balance.
Sometimes it was there, and other times...
I know, I know.
You always expected us to break up.
Why was that?
Is that because of your dumb five-minutes-from-now rule?
You know, after we stopped talking the five-minute rule started shrinking.
It went to four minutes, to three, then two, then one..
Let's go up to the rooftop.
Come on.
I thought my unconscious was trying to tell me something, you know.
By dreaming that dream a few nights ago.
Coming here, talking to you.
That might close the gap, that last minute.
Or..
Or none of this is really happening.
This could still be your dream.
¶ Dum dum dum ¶¶
Fuck!
What?
What happened?
'Fuckin' bird carcass on my windshield!
'
What?
Okay.
Slow down, tell me what's going on.
I'm saying a fucking bird just committed suicide on my windshield!
'What?
In the middle of our conversation?
'
What is our conversation have to do with anything?
It must mean something.
It must mean that the... that the..
Maybe the bird was commenting on our situation.
Commenting?
You think this is commentary?
Definitely, I mean, it's something, the universe cosmos, all that, via the bird, sent us a signal.
Yeah.
Okay.
I want you to listen to me very, very carefully.
Okay?
Okay, you're gonna be mean.
Aren't you?
On this already horrible call, you're gonna be mean on top of it.
'You are very, very, very..'
You know what?
I can't even say "very" enough so just imagine an infinite number of "verys." Okay?
Well, I don't have that kind of imagination.
I barely picture odd numbered things.
Well, freakin' try, okay?
'Cause that number of "verys" precedes sick.
Sick.
S-I-C-K.
Told you you were gonna be mean.
And condescending, as if I didn't know how to spell sick.
You are not being a nice person right now!
So, I'm at the gun range.
This is a nightmare.
Sartre was right, "Hell is other people."
I should go, I've got my goggles on.
'You did this on purpose, didn't you?
'
You wanted me to find out when I was three thousand miles away.
You were telegraphing all the signs like you were Samuel fucking Morse.
You wanted me to know.
That's the part that hurts the most.
'Why would I want that?
'
Because maybe your feelings for him are real.
How long has it been going on?
About a month.
'Amonth!
Oh shit!
'
'I'm so sorry for interrupting the honeymoon period.'
I hear those are the best parts of a relationship.
I-I'm gonna go, okay, I've got my goggles on...
Yes, I fucking heard you.
Enough with the goggles already!
Jesus Christ!
How're you gonna get off the phone and just go about your day after this, huh?
Because I don't think all of our conversations need to necessarily feel good.
'They should feel bad then?
'
They should be whatever the conversation should...
I don't know.
Why are you analyzing this so much?
'Oh, I'm not analyzing you yet.'
I'm just giving you my initial gut reaction.
Can I please get off the phone with you and not feel like shit...
You hurt me!
You really hurt me this time, Kimberly.
I wanna break up with you.
I don't love you.
Dell, that's not what you want to say...
That is what I want to say actually.
I don't..
I don't love you, Kimberly.
Honestly, I don't know if I ever really did.
'And you definitely didn't.'
If you're capable of making choices that knowingly hurts the other person, that's not love.
Okay, you're mad, you're mad..
How can you say that?
'Reality is I could have met any number of girls' 'to be with for a few years.'
That was your lie.
Alright?
'Texting Jack behind my back.'
'It came when I least expected it.'
I fell for it hook, line and sinker and it fucking hurts.
That was your lie.
Bravo. 'Okay, fine.'
You wanna hurt me?
You wanna be right?
Fine, go ahead.
Be right.
All I ever wanted was the truth.
No, no, you wanna be right.
'No.
Truth is not what you're after.'
'Because if you wanted the truth, then you would have to accept' 'the fact that I do... '
Who is this?
'I'm sorry, is this Dell?
'
Who's this?
'Yes,hi.
ThisisNancy.'
'I'm your mother's nurse.
We met a few times.'
Yeah.
'I'm really sorry to have to tell you this.'
'Your mother passed away.'
What?
That's impossible.
She's been okay for years now.
Her cancer's been in remission.
'She had a heart attack.'
Heart attack?
Why?
'Sometimes these things just happen.'
'This feels strange.'
'Not what I expected my train ride to feel like at all.'
What were you expecting?
I was expecting to read that short story.
The Roald Dahl one?
You already read it though.
You know the ending.
Sometimes it's not about knowing the ending.
It can't be the same like it was the last time.
It has to be different or we'll wind up right where we started.
I know.
I know.
I promise you a change.
I promise, okay?
You know, I'm falling out of love with you, right?
Just shut up for a second, please.
What do you wanna tell me, Dell?
Kimberly..
I used to find it annoying when you said "so" all the time.
It bugged the shit out of me.
And I love it.
I love it now.
After we have sex and you shrug your shoulders and you say, "I'm here all week."
I love that.
I love that a single strand of your hair can fall so perfectly to the side, and you don't even know.
I love the little blue veins behind your eyes.
I love your eyes.
Knowing you goes down as easily the best thing that's ever happened to me.
Easily.
If I were a restaurant, you'd be my special but nobody could order you because I'd just want you to be mine, just all mine.
Not in the biblical, slavery-owning sense or, uh, the pimp-prostitute dynamic of,
"You be mine, bitch!" but... but, just in that..
You're my love.
You're my love.
But my favorite thing of all.
I like you because you like me.
I think that says a lot about how great you are as a person.
'So, um...'
'Dell.'
Believe me.
Believe me when I say..
You almost had me.
'Is that weird to imagine that one day' 'this will all be old to us?
'
This walk, us meeting.
It'll just be an old memory.
That sounds..
Sad.
Hey, I gotta ask you a really big question.
I don't know if you can handle it.
It's...
It's really big.
What?
Forget it.
It's stupid.
What?
'Forget it.'
It's a stupid joke.
You'd probably even figure it out by now.
Why would I know the joke?
BecauseI 'vealreadysaidit.
When?
Earlierintheconversation.
When?
Hey, come on.
I'm so confused!
Sometimes I wanna stop people on the streets...
Who?
Anybody, from all walks of life.
On their way to work, to the gym, to school!
I wanna stop them all, grab them like I'm grabbing you right now.
Right now?
Right now.
I wanna look right into their eyes and I wanna ask them one simple question.
Where's my fucking money?
I think I'm going to fall in love with you too.
Are you crying?
Shut up.
'There's still my theory..' '...that this is just part of that strange dream.'
'And so..' '...even if we do kiss, you'll just wake up' 'and it'll all be over.'
This can't be a dream.
What if it is?
What're you doing?
Something's wrong.
I know it, Kimberly, I know you.
You have circles under your eyes.
You were the type of girl that could sleep through wars.
And despite that, you're still looking so beautiful.
More beautiful than ever, in fact.
It's usually a sign you wanna remind the world that you're a sexual being because your man's not picking up the signal.
You've checked out of this relationship, haven't you?
You're not happy.
Also, you're listening to Roxette.
I know that means the beginning of the end.
And let's get real for a second about the ring, alright.
You're not having it sized.
I'm sure you had your ring-size burned into Jack's memory years ago.
Fuck, I still remember it, 4.5.
You didn't wear the ring because you didn't want me to see it.
Don't marry him, okay.
I want you back.
I know you want me back too.
That's why I'm here.
That's what you've been wanting to say to me this whole time...
Dell.
What?
I'm pregnant.
What?
Morning sickness has been keeping me up.
I just really love Roxette.
And I dressed this way not to announce to the world anything.
It was you.
I wanted to look good for you.
Because no matter how bad our relationship got
I wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for it.
Because I needed it.
I needed you in this life.
That's what I wanted to say.
I gotta..
I gotta sit down.
I'm sorry.
I'm not leaving Jack.
I love him.
Wow.
You're pregnant.
I didn't see that coming.
Do you know what it is yet?
Not yet.
Hoping it's a girl.
Uh, I almost proposed to you, you know?
When we were in that hotel room in Paris.
I even picked out the ring.
I had it with me.
I was about to give it to you, and then I took it and I flushed it down the toilet.
I keep replaying that moment over and over again in my head.
Why are you crying?
I'm just happy to see you.
And it's such a beautiful night.
I feel like I'm in the wrong world.
'Cause I don't belong in a world where we don't end up together.
I don't.
There are parallel universes out there where this didn't happen.
Where I was with you, and you were with me.
And whatever universe that is that's the one where my heart lives in.
I wanted so badly to go back into that dream I had the other night.
I tried so hard... to go back to sleep.
You know, I never thought love was real.
I didn't.
And now I think life isn't real without it.
That sounds like a really bad greeting card...
Don't.
Don't make it a joke.
Truth?
I think you always believed in love.
This is so stupid.
So irrational.
Why am I so hell-bent on getting you back?
You fucking hate Pixar movies for crying out loud.
You still have an AOL account.
I don't wanna be with a person like that.
Why does it feel so impossible to let you go?
It's an addiction, you know.
That's all it is.
It's a biochemical addiction.
It's so stupid.
If you think about it relationships are all totally narcissistic.
Basically, you're just looking for someone who'll love you as much as you love yourself.
That's all it is.
No, it's not.
Yes, it is.
No, it's not.
No, it's not.
I don't know anything anymore.
But I know I do love you.
Dell...
Justgiveme aminute,okay .
Previously on Penny Dreadful...
What does it say to you?
Open your lips.
Taste.
To the most mysterious thing in London...
Miss Vanessa Ives.
I need blood, you fucking devil whore!
Professor Van Helsing.
Hematophagy, the eating of blood.
Sir Malcolm is looking for a cure for something he doesn't understand.
Do you?
Intimately.
Do what you have promised me.
I will need supplies.
Then find them.
My bride must be beautiful.
What's going on?
You're fucking a skeleton every night.
There's no future in it for either of us.
You want to watch me die?
The master has taught me much.
Things no one should ever know.
Save me from him.
Please.
Mina needs our help.
Will you let me in?
How far do we go?
There is no going back from this moment.
I'm with you.
And you think it was the creature we seek?
I would assume so.
I mean, how many of them can there be?
They do rather stand out.
I can't stay in this foul room.
Did you sense anything last night?
No.
Can you try?
I can't summon these things up.
It was in this house.
In your room!
For God's sake, do something!
You don't think I'm trying?
Leave me alone.
Have you forgotten Mina?
Have you forgotten why we're doing any of this?
I've lost my family!
I lost my family too.
Have you forgotten that?
I'll try.
Where've you been all night?
I went out with Mr. Gray.
He's a devil, that one.
I'm so sorry about last night.
I was waspish cruel outside the theater, and for no good reason.
I deserved a lot worse.
I still do.
Oh, Ethan, will you not forgive yourself?
We've all sinned.
No one knows that better than me, but you're a good, true man for all that...
For all that.
I love you with all my heart.
And I you.
Vanessa.
Help me.
I don't know.
What did you find?
It's unclear, like an echo already passed.
But two of the cards suggested a ship or something to do with the river trade.
And something terrible happening on the ship.
The port of London, do you think?
Likely so.
I'll check the shipping registry to see what I can discover.
Sir Malcolm.
Mr. Gray, please come in.
Thank you.
I've come to make amends to Miss Ives for leaving the theater last night without making my apologies.
Oh, that's not necessary.
In that case, would you like to have an adventure?
You mean... now?
Is there any other time?
I'm terribly sorry, but I'm engaged currently.
Oh, by all means, you must go.
The air will do you good.
Well then, yes, Mr. Gray, I should like an adventure.
Let me get my coat.
I hope you don't mind me stealing Miss Ives for a bit.
At your pleasure, sir.
She is always her own creature, our Miss Ives.
Hello?
Hello?
I've never been down here.
It's like a whole different world.
Very close it is.
I've brought my blood tube.
It's getting clogged and, um...
I'll, um...
I'll fix it for you.
You've a great many books.
Passes the time, ma'am.
You know my name.
Aren't we family here?
Yes.
Maud Gunnison.
Thank you.
My brother was in an accident, you see.
Back in Newcastle.
It was a steam engine on a ship.
Exploded.
He was burned.
After that happened, he always looked away, like you do.
I missed seeing his face, my brother.
His name is Lucifer.
Yes, I know, but it's not like that.
It actually means "Bringer of the light".
Or something like that.
I don't read much, so I don't really know.
We call him Luke in any case.
Uh...
Thank you for your help.
Well, the autopsy revealed nothing out of the ordinary beyond signs of malnutrition and incipient anemia.
Whatever young Fenton was, he wasn't entirely preternatural.
But he had the power to summon the creature.
Yes.
I imagine it's rather like bats with echolocation, a communication we cannot see, but exists.
I shall discuss it with Professor Van Helsing.
Very good.
Let me know what you discover.
And you?
Educating myself on matters nautical.
To what end?
Possibly undertaking another hunting expedition.
Oh.
When?
You will not be required, Doctor.
Good day.
I have been thinking about your daughter.
And?
Say you find her, but say she cannot be saved.
If I find her, she will be saved.
No.
For all the blood we share, for the miles we have walked,
Malcolm, we are not the same.
Where I come from, we know some people cannot be saved.
Say your daughter is one of them.
What then?
Know what you are going to do.
This is my first time.
Oh, I envy you that.
How it is you've never been photographed?
It's funny, actually.
I've a bit of a resistance to it.
Then why did you agree?
You seem a man born to overcome resistance.
There are those native tribes who believe you give away something of your soul when you're photographed.
Perhaps you do.
And what will you do with this little bit of my soul?
Protect it.
And you...
Have you been photographed much?
I prefer paintings.
Photographs are so ironically impermanent.
They capture one moment in time to perfection.
A painting can capture eternity.
I've never been painted, I couldn't say.
But you do understand eternity,
I know that.
The workings of time.
All right, ma'am.
Uh, please hold very still.
There'll be a flash of the powder.
Try not to react.
You may look at the camera or look away, ma'am.
It's up to you.
It is for eternity after all.
Your choice.
Hello, darling.
What's that?
I think a love token.
Do I have a rival?
Hardly.
Thank you for the most unexpected afternoon.
My pleasure.
And how will you spend the rest of your day?
Ruminating.
Well, good afternoon then.
Mr. Gray...
Do you have plans for dinner?
Not anymore.
My young friend.
Ah...
Professor Van Helsing.
Thank you for coming.
Oh, I have known my great love.
My Hannah, God bless her.
And you?
I was cursed with poetry very young.
It creates extremely unrealistic expectations.
It will happen.
You cannot live only in your work.
My work is...
Preoccupying.
I was much the same.
Uh, never looking up from the cadaver.
I imagined that I was content.
And then one day I'm having lunch.
Bent over my anatomy books,
I looked up and there she was.
A pale blue dress with embroidered flowers.
So, look up, my friend.
Our work cannot control us.
We must control it.
If only we could.
There are times when we are compelled.
And what compels you?
Do you believe in fate?
- Deeply.
- I don't mean justice.
I mean retribution.
I mean facing the consequences of your actions that have produced catastrophe.
A sin that is everlasting.
One that you have made immortal.
There is a...
A line from Shelley that haunts me.
A single line from Adonais.
I cannot get it out of my head.
"No more let Life divide
"what Death can join together"
Will you tell me your story?
One day, my good friend.
One day.
Oh.
Go on, show us the whole picture.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
And what are your plans?
Oh, I'm bound to the ledger, I'm afraid.
The Geographic Society is becoming concerned about the cost of the expedition.
Enjoy your evening, my dear.
It's not too...
It's perfect.
You sleep.
How am I to sleep with you running around
God knows where of an evening?
Don't worry about me.
I've been through worse.
Why, back in America...
I used to fight 10 redskins before breakfast.
I know, I know, you great heroic man, you.
Stay there for a moment.
Let me look at you.
Best you didn't kiss me anymore.
Keep a safe distance.
Too late for that.
And if you get sick?
Then you'll take care of me.
The medal around my neck.
Would you wear it for me tonight?
St. Jude.
Patron saint of causes long since lost.
For me.
Thank you for meeting us.
Where's Miss Ives?
She's not with us tonight.
And why is that?
Another time.
Come, we have a distance to walk.
Wait.
First tell me what we're doing here.
We're going to explore a plague ship.
Come this way.
You asked me once if Sir Malcolm knew what he was seeking.
He does not.
Not fully.
God grant that he shall never know.
Of what I am about to tell you, we cannot enlighten him.
Why not?
Because the truth is unendurable.
My late wife, Hannah, she of the pale blue dress with the embroidered flowers, she did not succumb to a disease precisely.
Of what did she succumb?
I drove a stake through her heart and cut off her head.
You're brooding, Mr. Chandler.
It's Miss Croft.
She's not well.
Ah.
Have you considered an institution?
I went to take a look at one.
It was a prison with people in big rooms waiting to die.
Do you hold out hope for her end?
I hold out dignity.
I would pay for a private asylum in the country.
I appreciate that.
We'll stay at home.
She will need opiates before long, for the pain.
She will cease being who she is.
Then I'll love who she becomes.
Berth 17 is ahead.
Why this ship?
It came from Cairo four months ago and has been in quarantine since, for what they're vaguely describing as
"typhus or an unknown foreign disease".
You recall the hieroglyphic tattoos we discovered?
Those were Egyptian.
That, and the fact the ship's in quarantine, is suggestive.
Of what?
Chicanery.
I'll serve.
I'm jealous of your company.
I fell under the sway of the Fabians for a period, only ate vegetables.
It was hell.
And their philosophy?
It was... diverting, but I've been through so many.
Transcendentalism, utilitarianism,
Aestheticism, Ludditism,
Taoism, socialism.
That didn't stick.
Seeking what?
Happiness?
They all made me equally happy.
Meaning they all left you equally unhappy.
And religion?
You mean God?
For the sake of argument, let's say I do.
I like the ritual of church, I suppose.
Especially Catholicism.
And you?
I have a complicated history with the Almighty.
I think, Mr. Gray, there are, um, tremors around us.
Like the vibrations of a note of music, hidden music.
Some might be more attuned to them than others.
What do those people do, those who have been chosen?
They endure uniqueness.
To be alien.
To be disenfranchised from those around you.
Is that not a dreadful curse?
To be different.
To be powerful.
Is that not a divine gift?
To be alone.
To be seeking.
What?
Another.
Like you.
Who shares your rarity.
Then you are no longer unique.
Nor are you alone.
Do you know the word "vampire"?
No.
It is not familiar to you in some way?
I don't believe so.
Nor to many others.
Aside from a small percentage of the reading public with a taste in a certain kind of literature.
A penny dreadful?
One in particular.
As literature it is uninspiring, but as folklore from the Balkans popularized, it is not without merit.
Mr. Rymer missed the facts, but he caught the truth.
There is on this earth a creature that exceeds what is commonly known as the limits of life and death.
This creature feeds on the blood of the living and can have transformative effects on those upon which it preys.
When you are marked by this creature, there is only death, a walking death or a somnolent obeisance.
Are they not unnerving?
Always looking at you.
I like to be looked at.
Not I.
Yet you wear that dress.
That was for your eyes.
All portraits.
I'm sorry?
They're all portraits.
You have no landscapes or still lives.
Are not people the most mysterious things?
I wish they were more so sometimes.
The glance that gives away the game.
The change in body posture.
And what do I give away?
Nothing.
What sort of music would you like?
Meaning who do I want to be at this moment.
Dorian Gray, who do you want to be?
Myself, without limits.
Then put on music for dancing.
You have exceptional composure.
Do I?
Poise, I mean.
Control.
Yes.
What if you were to abandon it?
I couldn't.
Why?
There are things within us all that can never be unleashed.
And what would happen if they were?
They would consume us.
We would cease to be and another would exist in our place, without control.
Without limits.
May I kiss your neck?
Don't ask permission.
If you want to do a thing, do it because it is your desire, not my allowance.
You must risk rejection.
You have experience with such a monster?
You know I do.
They move in a pack, like wolves.
Never staying in the same place long for fear of discovery.
When we come close, they are gone.
To what end?
You mean their goal?
I don't know.
What is any animal's goal?
Survival, propagation, conquest.
- Conquest?
- Who can say?
When we get near, they slip away, taking our most beloved with them, too fast to comprehend motive.
For the dead travel fast.
It's not her.
She must be here somewhere.
Why have you told me this?
Because you would have come to the same place without me.
And then?
You would have pursued it.
And that I would have had to prevent.
If I had a son,
I would wish him a long and easy life.
I think your life will not be easy, but it should be long.
Mine is practically over.
If I seek demons and in the chase am destroyed, no harm will come to mankind.
You could yet astonish the world.
I'm tired of your temporizing, demon.
Do what you have promised me.
So it shall be to all near those you.
Look upon him, Frankenstein.
Look upon your work.
Do not weep.
I have learned that skill.
It brings no solace.
None of these are Mina.
She's not here.
Father!
Mina!
No!
Father!
Mina!
Hello, my child.
I've been waiting.
What games we will have now.
Uh...
We'll find her again.
Will we?
At least you know she's alive.
Is that what you call it?
Let me tell you something, pal.
You're pretty goddamn sure you know what's going on all the time.
My father's the same.
He just stands above everything and moves all the little toy soldiers around.
Touched as I am by your childhood recollections, what's your point?
There are things you can't control.
There are battles you lose.
At the end of the day, the only thing we have is the people we trust.
Like Miss Ives.
And you trust her?
I do.
And you better start doing the same, or get ready to lose a lot of battles.
Vanessa, I have a lot to tell you.
I haven't been honest with you about...
Previously on Penny Dreadful:
- What does it say to you?
- Open your lips.
Taste.
To the most mysterious thing in London, Miss Vanessa Ives.
I need blood, you fucking devil whore!
Professor Van Helsing.
- Hematophagy, the eating of blood.
Sir Malcolm is looking for a cure for something he doesn't understand.
- Do you?
-Intimately.
- Do what you have promised me.
- I will need supplies.
Then find them.
My bride must be beautiful.
What's going on?
You're fucking a skeleton every night.
There's no future in it for either of us.
You wanna watch me die?
The master has taught me much.
Things no one should ever know.
Save me from him.
Please.
Mina needs our help.
- Will you let me in?
- How far do we go?
- There is no going back from this.
- I'm with you.
And you think it was the creature we seek?
I would assume so.
I mean, how many of them can there be?
They do rather stand out.
I can't stay in this foul room.
- Did you sense anything last night?
- No.
- Can you try?
- I can't summon these things up.
It was in this house.
In your room.
For God's sake, do something.
You don't think I'm trying?
Leave me alone.
Have you forgotten Mina?
Have you forgotten why we're doing any of this?
I've lost my family.
I lost my family too.
Have you forgotten that?
I'll try.
Where have you been all night?
I went out with Mr. Gray.
He's a devil, that one.
I'm so sorry about last night.
I was waspish cruel outside the theatre and for no good reason.
I deserved a lot worse.
I still do.
Oh, Ethan, will you not forgive yourself?
We've all sinned.
No one knows that better than me, but you're a good, true man for all that.
For all that.
I love you with all my heart.
And I you.
Vanessa.
Help me.
- I don't know.
- What did you find?
It's unclear, like an echo already passed.
But two of the cards suggested a ship or something to do with the river trade.
And something terrible happening on the ship.
The Port of London, do you think?
Likely so.
I'll check the shipping registry to see what I can discover.
Sir Malcolm.
Mr. Gray, please come in.
Thank you.
I've come to make amends to Miss Ives for leaving last night without making my apologies.
Oh, that's not necessary.
In that case, would you like to have an adventure?
You mean now?
Is there any other time?
I'm terribly sorry, but I'm engaged currently.
Oh, by all means, you must go.
The air will do you good.
Well, then, yes, Mr. Gray, I should like an adventure.
Let me get my coat.
I hope you don't mind me stealing Miss Ives for a bit.
At your pleasure, sir.
She is always her own creature, our Miss Ives.
Hello'?
Hello'?
I've never been down here.
It's like a whole different world.
Very close it is.
I've brought my blood tube.
It's getting clogged and...
I ugm...
I'll fix it for you.
You have a great many books.
Passes the time, ma'am.
You know my name.
Aren't we family here?
Yes.
- Maud Gunneson.
- Thank you.
My brother was in an accident, you see.
Back in Newcastle.
It was a steam engine on a ship.
Exploded.
He was burned.
After that happened, he always looked away, like you do.
I missed seeing his face, my brother.
His name is Lucifer.
Yes, I know, but it's not like that.
It actually means "bringer of the light."
Or something like that.
I don't read much, so I don't really know.
We call him Luke in any case.
Thank you for your help.
Well, the autopsy revealed nothing out of the ordinary beyond signs of malnutrition and incipient anaemia.
Whatever young Fenton was, he wasn't entirely preternatural.
But he had the power to summon the creature.
Yes.
I imagine it's rather like bats with echolocation.
Communication we cannot see but exists.
I shall discuss it with Professor Van Helsing.
Very good.
Let me know what you discover.
And you?
Educating myself on matters nautical.
- To what end'?
Possibly undertaking another hunting expedition.
- When?
- You will not be required, doctor.
Good day.
I have been thinking about your daughter.
- And?
- Say you find her but say she cannot be saved.
If I find her, she will be saved.
No.
For all the blood we share, for all the miles we have walked Malcolm, we are not the same.
Where I come from, we know some people cannot be saved.
Say your daughter is one of them.
What then?
Know what you are going to do.
This is my first time.
Oh, I envy you that.
How is it you've never been photographed?
It's funny, actually.
I have a bit of a resistance to it.
Then why did you agree?
You seem a man born to overcome resistance.
There are native tribes who believe you give away something of your soul when you're photographed.
Perhaps you do.
And what will you do with this bit of my soul?
Protect it.
And you, have you been photographed much'?
I prefer paintings.
Photographs are so ironically impermanent.
They capture one moment in time to perfection.
A painting can capture eternity.
I've never been painted.
I couldn't say.
But you do understand eternity.
I know that.
The workings of time.
All right, ma'am, please hold very still.
There'll be a flash of the powder.
Try not to react.
You may look at the camera or look away, ma'am.
It's up to you.
It is for eternity after all.
Your choice.
Hello, darling.
- What's that?
- I think a love token.
Do I have a rival?
Hardly.
Thank you for the most unexpected afternoon.
My pleasure.
And how will you spend the rest of your day?
Ruminating.
Well, good afternoon then.
Mr. Gray.
Do you have plans for dinner?
Not anymore.
My young friend.
Professor Van Helsing.
Thank you for coming.
Oh, I have known my great love.
My Hannah, God bless her.
And you?
I was cursed with poetry very young.
It creates extremely unrealistic expectations.
It will happen.
You cannot live only in your work.
My work is preoccupying.
I was much the same.
Never looking up from the cadaver.
I imagined that I was content.
And then one day, I'm having lunch.
Bent over my anatomy books, I looked up and there she was.
Pale blue dress with embroidered flowers.
So look up, my friend.
Our work cannot control us.
We must control it.
If only we could.
There are times when we are compelled.
And what compels you?
Do you believe in fate?
- Deeply.
- I don't mean justice.
I mean retribution.
I mean facing the consequences of your actions that have produced catastrophe.
A sin that is everlasting.
One that you have made immortal.
There is a...
A line from Shelley that haunts me.
A single line from "Adonais."
I cannot get it out of my head.
No more let life divide
What death can join together
Will you tell me your story?
One day, my good friend.
One day.
Go on, show us the whole picture.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
- And what are your plans?
- I'm bound to the ledger, I'm afraid.
The Geographic Society is becoming concerned about the cost of the expedition.
Enjoy your evening, my dear.
It's not too...
It's perfect.
You sleep.
How am I to sleep with you running around God knows where every evening?
Don't worry about me.

Know what you are going to do.
This is my first time.
DORIAN:
Oh, I envy you that.
How it is you've never been photographed?
It's funny, actually.
I've a bit of a resistance to it.
Then why did you agree?
You seem a man born to overcome resistance.
There are those native tribes who believe you give away something of your soul when you're photographed.
Perhaps you do.
And what will you do with this little bit of my soul?
Protect it.
And you...
Have you been photographed much?
I prefer paintings.
Photographs are so ironically impermanent.
They capture one moment in time to perfection.
A painting can capture eternity.
I've never been painted, I couldn't say.
But you do understand eternity,
I know that.
The workings of time.

All right, ma'am.

Ah...
Professor Van Helsing.
Thank you for coming.
Oh, I have known my great love.
My Hannah, God bless her.
And you?
I was cursed with poetry very young.
It creates extremely unrealistic expectations.
It will happen.
You cannot live only in your work.
My work is...
Preoccupying.
I was much the same.
Uh, never looking up from the cadaver.
I imagined that I was content.
And then one day I'm having lunch.
Bent over my anatomy books,
I looked up and there she was.
A pale blue dress with embroidered flowers.
So, look up, my friend.
Our work cannot control us.
We must control it.
If only we could.
There are times when we are compelled.
And what compels you?
Do you believe in fate?
- Deeply.
- I don't mean justice.
I mean retribution.
I mean facing the consequences of your actions that have produced catastrophe.
A sin that is everlasting.
One that you have made immortal.

SIR MALCOLM:
Thank you for meeting us.
Where's Miss Ives?
She's not with us tonight.
And why is that?
Another time.
Come, we have a distance to walk.
ETHAN:
Wait.
First tell me what we're doing here.
We're going to explore a plague ship.
Come this way.
You asked me once if Sir Malcolm knew what he was seeking.
He does not.
Not fully.
God grant that he shall never know.
Of what I am about to tell you, we cannot enlighten him.
Why not?
Because the truth is unendurable.
My late wife, Hannah, she of the pale blue dress with the embroidered flowers, she did not succumb to a disease precisely.
Of what did she succumb?
I drove a stake through her heart and cut off her head.
You're brooding, Mr. Chandler.
It's Miss Croft.
She's not well.
Ah.
Have you considered an institution?
I went to take a look at one.
It was a prison with people in big rooms waiting to die.
Do you hold out hope for her end?
I hold out dignity.
I would pay for a private asylum in the country.
I appreciate that.
We'll stay at home.
She will need opiates before long, for the pain.
She will cease being who she is.
Then I'll love who she becomes.
Berth 17 is ahead.
Why this ship?
It came from Cairo four months ago and has been in quarantine since, for what they're vaguely describing as
"typhus or an unknown foreign disease".
You recall the hieroglyphic tattoos we discovered?
Those were Egyptian.
That, and the fact the ship's in quarantine, is suggestive.
Of what?
Chicanery.
I'll serve.
I'm jealous of your company.
I fell under the sway of the Fabians for a period, only ate vegetables.
It was hell.
And their philosophy?
It was... diverting, but I've been through so many.
Transcendentalism, utilitarianism,
Aestheticism, Ludditism,
Taoism, socialism.
That didn't stick.
Seeking what?
Happiness?
They all made me equally happy.
Meaning they all left you equally unhappy.
(CHUCKLES)
And religion?
You mean God?
For the sake of argument, let's say I do.
I like the ritual of church, I suppose.
Especially Catholicism.
And you?
I have a complicated history with the Almighty.
I think, Mr. Gray, there are, um, tremors around us.
Like the vibrations of a note of music, hidden music.
Some might be more attuned to them than others.
What do those people do, those who have been chosen?
They endure uniqueness.
(CHUCKLES)
To be alien.
To be disenfranchised from those around you.
Is that not a dreadful curse?
To be different.
To be powerful.
Is that not a divine gift?
To be alone.
To be seeking.
What?
Another.
Like you.
Who shares your rarity.
Then you are no longer unique.
Nor are you alone.
(BELL TOLLING IN DISTANCE)
Do you know the word "vampire"?
No.
It is not familiar to you in some way?
I don't believe so.
Nor to many others.
Aside from a small percentage of the reading public with a taste in a certain kind of literature.
FRANKENSTEIN:
A penny dreadful?
One in particular.
As literature it is uninspiring, but as folklore from the Balkans popularized, it is not without merit.
Mr. Rymer missed the facts, but he caught the truth.
There is on this earth a creature that exceeds what is commonly known as the limits of life and death.
This creature feeds on the blood of the living and can have transformative effects on those upon which it preys.
When you are marked by this creature, there is only death, a walking death or a somnolent obeisance.

Vanessa, I have a lot to tell you.
I haven't been honest with you about...
Previously on Penny Dreadful...
What does it say to you?
Open your lips.
Taste.
To the most mysterious thing in London...
Miss Vanessa Ives.
I need blood, you fucking devil whore!
Professor Van Helsing.
Hematophagy, the eating of blood.
Sir Malcolm is looking for a cure for something he doesn't understand.
Do you?
Intimately.
Do what you have promised me.
I will need supplies.
Then find them.
My bride must be beautiful.
What's going on?
You're fucking a skeleton every night.
There's no future in it for either of us.
You want to watch me die?
The master has taught me much.
Things no one should ever know.
Save me from him.
Please.
Mina needs our help.
Will you let me in?
How far do we go?
There is no going back from this moment.
I'm with you.
And you think it was the creature we seek?
I would assume so.
I mean, how many of them can there be?
They do rather stand out.
I can't stay in this foul room.
Did you sense anything last night?
No.
Can you try?
I can't summon these things up.
It was in this house.
In your room!
For God's sake, do something!
You don't think I'm trying?
Leave me alone.
Have you forgotten Mina?
Have you forgotten why we're doing any of this?
I've lost my family!
I lost my family too.
Have you forgotten that?
I'll try.
Where've you been all night?
I went out with Mr. Gray.
He's a devil, that one.
I'm so sorry about last night.
I was waspish cruel outside the theater, and for no good reason.
I deserved a lot worse.
I still do.
Oh, Ethan, will you not forgive yourself?
We've all sinned.
No one knows that better than me, but you're a good, true man for all that...
For all that.
I love you with all my heart.
And I you.
Vanessa.
Help me.
I don't know.
What did you find?
It's unclear, like an echo already passed.
But two of the cards suggested a ship or something to do with the river trade.
And something terrible happening on the ship.
The port of London, do you think?
Likely so.
I'll check the shipping registry to see what I can discover.
Sir Malcolm.
Mr. Gray, please come in.
Thank you.
I've come to make amends to Miss Ives for leaving the theater last night without making my apologies.
Oh, that's not necessary.
In that case, would you like to have an adventure?
You mean... now?
Is there any other time?
I'm terribly sorry, but I'm engaged currently.
Oh, by all means, you must go.
The air will do you good.
Well then, yes, Mr. Gray, I should like an adventure.
Let me get my coat.
I hope you don't mind me stealing Miss Ives for a bit.
At your pleasure, sir.
She is always her own creature, our Miss Ives.
Hello?
Hello?
I've never been down here.
It's like a whole different world.
Very close it is.
I've brought my blood tube.
It's getting clogged and, um...
I'll, um...
I'll fix it for you.
You've a great many books.
Passes the time, ma'am.
You know my name.
Aren't we family here?
Yes.
Maud Gunnison.
Thank you.
My brother was in an accident, you see.
Back in Newcastle.
It was a steam engine on a ship.
Exploded.
He was burned.
After that happened, he always looked away, like you do.
I missed seeing his face, my brother.
His name is Lucifer.
Yes, I know, but it's not like that.
It actually means "Bringer of the light".
Or something like that.
I don't read much, so I don't really know.
We call him Luke in any case.
Uh...
Thank you for your help.
Well, the autopsy revealed nothing out of the ordinary beyond signs of malnutrition and incipient anemia.
Whatever young Fenton was, he wasn't entirely preternatural.
But he had the power to summon the creature.
Yes.
I imagine it's rather like bats with echolocation, a communication we cannot see, but exists.
I shall discuss it with Professor Van Helsing.
Very good.
Let me know what you discover.
And you?
Educating myself on matters nautical.
To what end?
Possibly undertaking another hunting expedition.
Oh.
When?
You will not be required, Doctor.
Good day.
I have been thinking about your daughter.
And?
Say you find her, but say she cannot be saved.
If I find her, she will be saved.
No.
For all the blood we share, for the miles we have walked,
Malcolm, we are not the same.
Where I come from, we know some people cannot be saved.
Say your daughter is one of them.
What then?
Know what you are going to do.

Won't his uncle be mad when you went to the contest and beat him?
Shut up, Axl!
Mom!
Fine, I'll move the appointment.
- Mom.
- Oh, and it can't be Wednesday.
That's when I have my JP-La meeting.
I'm gonna need snacks for when my friends are over.
I'm thinking a nice cheese-and-cracker platter with bologna rolls lined around the side for presentation.
It's important to feed the eyes, as well as the body.
But do mine first.
What are you doing?
Oh, Dr. Goodwin wants coffee for the waiting room.
I told him I'd bring this in, but I keep forgetting it.
Does he want you to clean it with a toilet brush?
Relax, this is brand-new I bought specifically for this.
Yeah, I...
[ Sniffs ] Yeah.
Tick-tock, people.
My notes?
!
Hello?
!
Come on.
What, Axl?
What exactly are you looking for?
Just walk me around.
I'll know it when I see it.
Oh, and for the crackers, nothing with seeds.
Are you writing this down?
Nope.
Nope.
Man, this place is a mess.
And write down to remember to switch my appointment, but not before 3:30.
Got it.
Got it.
Crackers, seeds, 3:30.
Oh, that's it!
Right there, under the doughnuts.
Now read them to me.
Axl, I am not going to read you your notes.
- I've got to get to work.
- Oh, my God!
I'm finally giving it my all and doing solid, C-level work here, and you're just gonna abandon me?
!
- Nice cyber-parenting, mom!
- [ Stammers ]
It's not like I could read any of this stuff, anyway.
It's just drawings of dragons and random woman-fish combos.
Well, then, you're gonna have to go down to the copy place and fax them to me.
No, you know what, Axl?
You're the one who left his notes.
You shouldn't be rewarded for it.
It's your responsibility, not mine.
[ Groans ]
I'll fax them when I get to work.
Frankie:
Now that they were officially dating,
Sue and Darrin were seeing a lot more of each other which meant we were also seeing a lot more of Sue and Darrin.
Oh, my God, Darrin.
You have crazy-long eyelashes.
Oh, no, they're not so long.
No, they are.
Look at them!
[ Laughs ] You can't look at your own eyes.
[ Laughs ]
I love how you scrunch your nose when you laugh.
[ Volume increases ] You have the cutest laugh.
I do not. [ Laughs ]
Yes, you do.
Stop. [ Laughs ]
I'm serious.
It's adorable.
He's got crazy-long eyelashes, and you've got the cutest laugh.
There.
It's settled.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Birds chirping ]
Stolen, Mike-- my car was stolen.
Why would somebody steal our crappy car?
Probably for parts 'cause nobody would want that thing as a whole.
I mean, I go outside, and gone.
The car is gone.
Yep, going to church every Sunday's really paying off.
Axl:
Hey, if I find it, can I have it?
No.
What are you doing here?
My clock broke, and I'm about to take a nap, so I need you guys to wake me in an hour.
- Goodbye, Axl.
- No, don't--
I mean, what kind of place is this where you go outside and somebody steals your old, crappy car in the middle of the day?
Are we gonna have to move to a smaller town?
'Cause I at least need a liquor store with self-serve yogurt.
All right, look, I'll check in with the police again and call insurance and see what we can get for it.
Oh, tell them I left a brand-new bag of cookies on the front seat.
Could go to motive.
[ Doorbell rings ]
Brick:
My friends are here.
Oh, crap.
Now?
!
Come on in, ladies.
Watch your step.
- Oh, aren't you a dear?
- What a sharp-looking shirt.
Brick:
Mom, I'd like you to meet
Violet, Opal Ruth, Sparkle, Helen, and Myrtle.
Very nice to meet you.
Hey, Brick, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Mm-hmm.
I'll be right in.
- Okay.
[ Indistinct talking ]
Woman:
Any room?
When you told me you were having friends over, did you think there was anything special you should mention about your friends?
Oh, right.
Helen just lost her husband, so don't play any Duke Ellington in the house.
Ah.
Anything else, like, oh, I don't know, they're a thousand?
Sorry.
They were renovating the conference room at the library, so I told the gals we could have book club here.
Speaking of which, how are we doing on the snacks?
Not well, Brick.
Did you not hear my car got stolen?
Look, if you forgot, just say you forgot.
[ Sighs ]
- See you, Frankie.
- Have a good night, Tina.
Thanks, you too.
- Oh, hey, you need a ride?
- No, I'm good.
My neighbor's coming to get me.
People really rally around you when your car gets stolen.
Oh, you didn't hear?
Last week, right here from this parking lot in broad daylight.
I mean, it's just so shocking that something like this would happen.
I can't believe someone would steal my car.
You mean the blue one with the scratch on the side?
Mm-hmm.
It's in the back.
It's been parked there all week.
[ Chuckles ]
Oh.
Right.
D-A-R-
- Darrin.
Sue:
Ohh, you're so good at this!
Thanks.
It's funny 'cause I'm a terrible real speller but a really good arm speller.
[ Chuckles ] Yeah.
[ Laughs ]
I know we said no boys in the bedroom, but maybe we should rethink it 'cause I got to get him out of my family room.
Maybe if Sue leaves the door open?
[ Chuckles ]
What?
Oh, it's just...
I have the funniest story.
I-
- You are not gonna believe this, but, um, my car has been found.
It has been retrieved.
Really?
!
That's great!
They caught the guy?
Well, kind of.
Uh, this is actually the funny part that is also a really good sign for humanity, actually?
Um, it was never stolen.
I just left it in the back and forgot.
[ Laughs ] [ Bottle opens ]
- What?
- [ Sighs ]
It's not my fault, Mike.
It wasn't where I usually park it.
See, I just pulled around the back to drop off the coffee urn, which was not part of my usual routine.
Are you kidding?
It's been there the whole week?
How could you not know where you parked your car?
'Cause I always park in the front.
Axl:
Oh, my God.
That is hilarious.
Why are you here again, Axl?
Shouldn't you be studying?
Wait, what happened?
Oh, good.
Did you find your car?
Who stole it?
It was an inside job-- very inside.
I don't think it matters who stole it or if it got stolen or what happened.
The important thing is we got it back and people are good at heart.
I mean, that's what we should be focusing on.
So you're telling me I spent every lunch this week filing police reports and digging out insurance papers, and you just forgot where you parked it?
That's mom for you!
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh, my God.
You forget everything.
- I do not.
- Really?
How about the time you couldn't find your phone, and it turns out you were just talking on it.
He's right, mom.
You did do that.
Movies!
She can never remember the names of any movies she sees.
That is completely untrue.
Mike, tell them.
We were just talking about movies yesterday.
"The one with the actress who adopted the African-American baby, but not Charlize Theron, the one before her"
is not technically the name of a movie.
Face it, dad.
Her brain's cheese.
Maybe she should get a CAT scan.
I am not getting a CAT scan.
Oh, actually, mom, that's not a bad idea.
Last week, you left the groceries on the stoop all night long.
From what Myrtle says about her sister, Edna, once they start, it's a slippery slope till they go.
- Hmm.
- Oh, my God.
That'll be so sad.
- Dad's gonna fall apart.
- I'll be all right.
Yeah, dad'll be fine.
I know some lovely widows that would be all over that action.
He's not going for one of your bitties, Brick.
He's gonna have a lot of options.
[ Gasps ] Ooh!
Maybe he'll bring in someone to take care of us, and then he'll fall in love with her like Maria in "The Sound Of Music."
And, hey, maybe she'll actually be able to cook.
Our bodies would probably go into shock at first, but then it it would be great.
[ Laughter ]
Okay, that's enough.
Frankie, even if your mind is totally shot,
I promise I'm not marrying anybody.
I'm probably just gonna want to date around for a while.
[ Laughter ]
Frankie:
So while everyone was all over me,
Mike made it his job to make sure no one was all over Sue.
[ Sue laughs ]
He lifted the ban against boys in Sue's room on the one condition that her door stay open.
[ Sue laughs ]
The only problem with an open door is you could hear everything.
You want me to tickle your arm again?
Darrin:
No, I got a new game.
And the only thing worse than hearing everything is not hearing anything.
Oh, I love crazy eights.
But I've never played it that way before.
That's it.
No boys in the bedroom.
Okay, guys, hit the couch.
I am calling a family meeting.
[ Groans ] What am I even doing here?
I'm barely even a part of this family.
Frankie:
Um, I have an empty fridge and a clogged toilet that says otherwise.
Okay, here's the thing-- I've had an epiphany.
[ All groan ]
Let me guess-- you're old and your life isn't fulfilling.
You're taking back the house.
There's gonna be major changes.
You're not gonna yell anymore.
You're losing them, Frankie.
Look, the reason I wanted to talk to you is because although presented in a way that was not entirely kind,
I do think you guys brought up some interesting points the other day.
I mean, I have been losing it lately.
I can't remember things the way I used to.
And the reason that I can't remember squat is because of you people.
My brain can't think its own thoughts because it's got all your crap in there crowding out all the space.
There's an elephant in the room, and its name is menopause.
[ Sighs ]
I have to keep track of your orthodontist appointments and you need your notes faxed and can I please buy your old-lady snacks and, "Frankie, remind me.
We got to pay that whatever by Friday."
I'm tired of being your junk drawer.
You people have perfectly good brains capable of storing your own information, and instead, you dump it all into mine and it fills and it fills and it crowds out all my thoughts and that's how I end up losing my car.
- Hey, don't lump me in with them.
- Oh, you're lumped.
Look, the point is, it's not working anymore.
It's not working for me, and it's not working for you.
And that's why I'm establishing office hours.
- What's office hours?
- Huh?
- What does that even mean?
Frankie:
It means that from now on, every day between 5:00 and 6:00,
I will be sitting at the kitchen table with my undivided attention waiting to hear whatever crap you kids need from me.
So if you need something signed, a check written, a schedule changed, that would be the time to calmly make that request-- not screaming it at me as I'm running out of the house, or slipping a note under the bathroom door
while I'm on the toilet.
So we're not allowed to talk to you at all unless it's between 5:00 and 6:00?
Well, that would probably be more of a phase-two thing, but I like the way you're thinking.
Frankie:
Yep, I've had some low-grade, B-level epiphanies before, but I got to say, I knocked this one out of the park.
And I need you to move my scoliosis appointment on the 15th.
Brad and I are offering a free self-esteem workshop after school that day.
"Don't listen to the crowd.
You're great."
Hmm.
Okay.
Moving scoliosis appointment.
Anything else?
Yes, on Tuesday, I'm gonna need a ride to visit Sparkle in the hospital.
Bless her heart, she's getting her fourth knee.
Ohh.
Ride on Tuesday.
Got it.
Is that all?
No.
I also need a check.
Me and Hutch found this awesome apartment for next year.
Sue:
And don't forget I need you to sign my application for Miss Teen Orson.
Fingers crossed.
I inadvertently chewed a girl's hair, so you might be getting a call from my teacher about that.
Did you guys take out a credit card in my name?
We did it as Axl J Heck, so you should be fine.
We're not morons.
What else do you need?
Index cards.
More underwear.
Italian wedding cookies.
[ Car horn honks ]
Well, that's my ride to the Kay Kyser Big Band Experience.
Oh, don't wait up.
We might stop afterwards and get a little nosh.
Mike.
I came into the kitchen.
Yes.
I can see that.
And do you know why?
'Cause I do.
I am here to get a screwdriver, and I know what I'm gonna do with it.
I'm gonna use it to pry out that wad of q-tips from the bathroom drawer.
Hmm.
My locker combination from junior high-- 23-42-7.
The first actress that adopted the cute African-American baby was, oh, yeah, Sandra Bullock.
♪ I'm all out of love ♪
♪ I'm so lost without you ♪
Whoo!
I know all the lyrics now.
Ohh, my brain is mine again, Mike-- mine.
You have no idea how freeing this is.
Are you sure they're okay in the basement together?
I threw a tennis ball down the stairs to scare them, but what else can we do?
- What?
- Sue and Darrin.
They're downstairs.
Are we sure this is such a great idea?
Well, you didn't want them in the family room.
You didn't want them in Sue's room.
Where else are they supposed to go?
I don't know.
I don't like it, Frankie.
Look, you're the one that was all worked up about Sue and Darrin.
Now all of a sudden, you're not?
I don't know what to tell you Mike.
Maybe it's just with my mind clear,
I'm feeling more zen about the whole thing.
I'm just more centered now.
Well, you're definitely more annoying.
Well...
- [ Gasps ]
- What?
[ Gasps ]
- Let go!
- I'm trying!
You're ruining my favorite sweater!
Stupid swatch!
Huh?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Help!
Darrin:
Oh.
Hey, Mr. Heck.
Upstairs.
Now.
Listen, sir, I know that may have looked bad, but I want you to know that I have the utmost respect for your daughter.
Well, not just her, but you, too.
I mean, the reason I come here so much is because you make me feel so comfortable.
Then that's my fault if I've given you any impression that you should feel comfortable.
Here's what you need to know about you and me.
Think of it like a soccer game.
You're a player.
I'm the goalkeeper.
You can't use your hands.
I only play defense.
I'm the world's best goalkeeper, and I'm gonna do everything I can to stop you.
Bottom line-- you will not be scoring on me.
Got it?
I understand what you're saying, sir.
I guess I just want you to know that I care a lot about Sue and that I would never do anything to hurt her and that you can trust me.
[ Sighs ]
Here's all I need to know about you, Darrin-- you're 19 and a male.
I will never trust you.
Actually, I'm 20.
I skipped a grade.
That's the one where you repeat a year, right?
No, that's getting held back.
Oh, yeah.
That's the one I did.
Yeah.
Okay.
Sorry.
Sorry I'm late.
Whoo.
Shoot.
Well, after months of reading about clubs, wives, and counties, the book club is finally reading something I recommended-- "Planet Nowhere."
Your meter's running, Brick.
What do you need?
Well, I thought it would be fun, as part of our follow-up discussion, if I made Silligan noses for everyone to wear.
So can you scoot me over to the fabric store?
Sue:
Mom, you have to talk to dad.
He is being ridiculous.
He yelled at my boyfriend when we weren't even doing anything.
Axl:
Hey, what I have to say is way more important than whatever they're saying.
- Axl, it is not your turn!
- I was here first.
I'm screwed out of my apartment thanks to you.
What?
What are you talking about?
The landlord told me this morning he needed a deposit by 3:00 today, but I couldn't talk to you until 5:00 'cause of your stupid office hours.
And it was above a tanning salon.
Way to go, mom!
Axl, that is ridiculous.
If you needed that check by 3:00, you should have called me and told me.
But that's not what you said.
You said we could only talk to you during office hours.
- You keep changing the rules.
- I'm not changing the rules.
Obviously, if there's a real problem,
I will deal with it outside of office hours.
Well, how are we supposed to know that?
- Face it, this is all your fault!
- It is not my fault!
Axl, you are old enough to realize that--
You know what?
Forget it.
I'm done.
The office is closed.
- No.
- No, mom, wait, wait!
Sue, pick me up and follow her!
I need to talk to mom!
- Ohh, I'll pay you 10 bucks.
- Fine!
But that's on top of the $20 you already owe me from serving you dinner in the bathtub.
Mom, the least you could do is buy me a car 'cause I guess I'll be living in it!
Stop following me, Axl-
- I mean, Sue.
Hello?
I don't think I got a firm answer on the fabric store.
And I never got an answer if you're gonna talk to dad or not.
You know, Axl had girls over all the time, and he never confronted them.
Axl, tell her.
Tell her!
Tell her.
Tell her!
Okay, everybody just needs to calm down and give me a minute.
No, no, no.
This is our time now.
You can't take one of our minutes.
Come on, mom.
Silligan noses don't grow on trees.
Actually, they do in one book, but--
Mom, mom, just ignore these losers and listen to me!
Axl, stop interrupting!
Okay, Axl, you know what?
I am done with this.
Here, I am not carrying you anymore.
Brick, you carry him.
I don't want to carry him.
- I need everybody--
- Ohh!
[ Crashes ]
Dad?
Can I talk to you a sec?
Okay.
I want to know what you said to Darrin.
What I had to say to Darrin is between me and Darrin.
When Axl was dating Cassidy, did you talk to Cassidy and not tell Axl?
That was different.
How?
Look, Sue, there are just certain...
types of situations that I'm trying to help you avoid.
Like what types of situations?
- I don't know.
Just stuff.
- What stuff?
I don't know.
Just stuff.
Look, dad, if this is about kissing,
Darrin and I are going to kiss, okay?
That is what boyfriends and girlfriends do.
I know that.
That-- that-- that's not the stuff that I'm talking about.
Then what stuff?
What else do you think I would do?
Oh!
Oh!
My God!
Dad!
Do you even know me at all?
No.
That is not happening!
I am not ready for that.
Oh, okay.
Well, good, then.
And by the way, when it does eventually happen, it is not going to be in a basement.
It is going to be in front of a beautiful, roaring fire and a Christmas tree.
Ah... don't need the details.
[ Exhales sharply ]
Look, Sue, um...
I'm just flying by the seat of my pants here, okay?
I didn't have any sisters or anything, and, uh...
I guess whenever I thought of being a dad,
I didn't think of being a dad to a girl, so...
I guess I'm saying I'm gonna make mistakes, but I'm not gonna apologize for protecting my daughter, okay?
I'm-
- I'm just not.
Aw.
[ Chuckles ]
You know, dad, I'm okay.
I know you are.
It's me I'm kind of worried about.
Yeah, I know I'm late with the deposit, but if I drive up there after work, is there any chance that you would still accept it?
They're such great boys-- so reliable and respectful.
You're really gonna want them in your apartment.
Yeah, sure.
I'll hold.
Hey, Mike.
I'm writing an e-mail to the school to try to get Sue a new laptop.
How does this sound?
"So, as I pushed the woman out of the path of the oncoming bus..."
I think you used that for Axl's busted yearbook camera.
I did?
Ohh, no!
It's all slipping away!
The-- the clarity, the clear mind.
Mike, listen to me, there's Easter decorations
I bought last year on sale in the bottom of the closet.
Don't let me forget.
What else?
Think.
Think.
Oh, no.
It's gone.
It's all gone!
It was such a good system.
It should have worked.
See you on the other side, Frankie.
[ Sighs ] Oh, crap, I'm late for work.
Frankie:
Yep, there's no such thing as office hours when you've got kids.
That's just how parenting is.
It's always uncomfortable.
It's often a bad time.
And it's forever.
[ Indistinct conversations ]
Frankie?
What the hell are you doing here?
[ Sighs ]
[ Microwave beeps ] ♪ I'm all out of love ♪
[ Humming ]
Well, they don't get "Planet Nowhere" at all.
I had to explain the Silligans five times.
I mean, how hard is it to understand that their noses give them special powers, a precognition and echolocation.
And don't even get me started on Sorn.
They thought he needed to meet someone and settle down.
The leader of the Vernagle Army.
Can you believe it?
I don't get it...
We have nothing in common.
It's like we are from two different worlds!
Looks like I won't be needing these any more.
[ Crow caws ]
Frankie:
Out here in the Middle, we're used to having things sprung on us-- tornadoes, floods, locusts.
But some things you never see coming.
I'm having five friends over after school today.
What?
You're having five friends over?
- You have five friends?
- Yep.
For the past few months, we've gotten to be a pretty tight-knit group.
We share a lot of the same interests.
I thought you always wanted me to have friends over.
These are people, right?
Not bugs.
Yeah, people.
No, it's-- it's great, Brick.
It's-- it's just that, you know, the house isn't clean.
Well, if we have to wait for that...
No, I just meant that, you know, if we're having people over,
I just would like to be a little more organized.
Sue:
No, I can't do that, Axl!
I cannot miss morning announcements.
- Mom.
Axl:
- One thing!
I ask you to do one thing!
Okay, knock it off!
Stop fighting with your brother.
Where is your brother?
I'm right here.
I got class at 9:00, and Sue won't help me find my psych notes.
I must have left them there last time I was home gracing you people with my glorious presence.
Everyone is not here just to serve you, Axl.
Oh, mom, I need you to move my orthodontist appointment on Friday so I can go to the county fair with Darrin.
His uncle is entering his prized pig in the contest.
Won't his uncle be mad when you went to the contest and beat him?
Shut up, Axl!
Mom!
Fine, I'll move the appointment.
- Mom.
- Oh, and it can't be Wednesday.
That's when I have my JP-La meeting.
I'm gonna need snacks for when my friends are over.
I'm thinking a nice cheese-and-cracker platter with bologna rolls lined around the side for presentation.
It's important to feed the eyes, as well as the body.
But do mine first.
What are you doing?
Oh, Dr. Goodwin wants coffee for the waiting room.
I told him I'd bring this in, but I keep forgetting it.
Does he want you to clean it with a toilet brush?
Relax, this is brand-new I bought specifically for this.
Yeah, I...
[ Sniffs ] Yeah.
Tick-tock, people.
My notes?
!
Hello?
!
Come on.
What, Axl?
What exactly are you looking for?
Just walk me around.
I'll know it when I see it.
Oh, and for the crackers, nothing with seeds.
Are you writing this down?
Nope.
Nope.
Man, this place is a mess.
And write down to remember to switch my appointment, but not before 3:30.
Got it.
Got it.
Crackers, seeds, 3:30.
Oh, that's it!
Right there, under the doughnuts.
Now read them to me.
Axl, I am not going to read you your notes.
- I've got to get to work.
- Oh, my God!
I'm finally giving it my all and doing solid, C-level work here, and you're just gonna abandon me?
!
- Nice cyber-parenting, mom!
- [ Stammers ]
It's not like I could read any of this stuff, anyway.
It's just drawings of dragons and random woman-fish combos.
Well, then, you're gonna have to go down to the copy place and fax them to me.
No, you know what, Axl?
You're the one who left his notes.
You shouldn't be rewarded for it.
It's your responsibility, not mine.
[ Groans ]
I'll fax them when I get to work.
Frankie:
Now that they were officially dating,
Sue and Darrin were seeing a lot more of each other which meant we were also seeing a lot more of Sue and Darrin.
Oh, my God, Darrin.
You have crazy-long eyelashes.
Oh, no, they're not so long.
No, they are.
Look at them!
[ Laughs ] You can't look at your own eyes.
[ Laughs ]
I love how you scrunch your nose when you laugh.
[ Volume increases ] You have the cutest laugh.
I do not. [ Laughs ]
Yes, you do.
Stop. [ Laughs ]
I'm serious.
It's adorable.
He's got crazy-long eyelashes, and you've got the cutest laugh.
There.
It's settled.

Stolen, Mike-- my car was stolen.
Why would somebody steal our crappy car?
Probably for parts 'cause nobody would want that thing as a whole.
I mean, I go outside, and gone.
The car is gone.
Yep, going to church every Sunday's really paying off.

Hey, if I find it, can I have it?
No.
What are you doing here?

- Goodbye, Axl.
- No, don't--
I mean, what kind of place is this where you go outside and somebody steals your old, crappy car in the middle of the day?
Are we gonna have to move to a smaller town?
'Cause I at least need a liquor store with self-serve yogurt.
All right, look, I'll check in with the police again and call insurance and see what we can get for it.
Oh, tell them I left a brand-new bag of cookies on the front seat.

When you told me you were having friends over, did you think there was anything special you should mention about your friends?
Oh, right.
Helen just lost her husband, so don't play any Duke Ellington in the house.
Ah.
Anything else, like, oh, I don't know, they're a thousand?
Sorry.
They were renovating the conference room at the library, so I told the gals we could have book club here.
Speaking of which, how are we doing on the snacks?
Not well, Brick.
Did you not hear my car got stolen?
Look, if you forgot, just say you forgot.
[ Sighs ]
- See you, Frankie.
- Have a good night, Tina.
Thanks, you too.
- Oh, hey, you need a ride?
- No, I'm good.
My neighbor's coming to get me.
People really rally around you when your car gets stolen.
Oh, you didn't hear?
Last week, right here from this parking lot in broad daylight.
I mean, it's just so shocking that something like this would happen.
I can't believe someone would steal my car.
You mean the blue one with the scratch on the side?
Mm-hmm.
It's in the back.
It's been parked there all week.
[ Chuckles ]
Oh.
Right.
D-A-R-
- Darrin.
Sue:
Ohh, you're so good at this!
Thanks.
It's funny 'cause I'm a terrible real speller but a really good arm speller.
[ Chuckles ] Yeah.
[ Laughs ]
I know we said no boys in the bedroom, but maybe we should rethink it 'cause I got to get him out of my family room.
Maybe if Sue leaves the door open?
[ Chuckles ]
What?
Oh, it's just...
I have the funniest story.
I-
- You are not gonna believe this, but, um, my car has been found.
It has been retrieved.
Really?
!
That's great!
They caught the guy?
Well, kind of.
Uh, this is actually the funny part that is also a really good sign for humanity, actually?
Um, it was never stolen.
I just left it in the back and forgot.
[ Laughs ] [ Bottle opens ]
- What?
- [ Sighs ]
It's not my fault, Mike.
It wasn't where I usually park it.
See, I just pulled around the back to drop off the coffee urn, which was not part of my usual routine.
Are you kidding?
It's been there the whole week?
How could you not know where you parked your car?
'Cause I always park in the front.
Axl:
Oh, my God.
That is hilarious.
Why are you here again, Axl?
Shouldn't you be studying?
Wait, what happened?
Oh, good.
Did you find your car?
Who stole it?
It was an inside job-- very inside.
I don't think it matters who stole it or if it got stolen or what happened.
The important thing is we got it back and people are good at heart.
I mean, that's what we should be focusing on.
So you're telling me I spent every lunch this week filing police reports and digging out insurance papers, and you just forgot where you parked it?
That's mom for you!
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh, my God.
You forget everything.
- I do not.
- Really?
How about the time you couldn't find your phone, and it turns out you were just talking on it.
He's right, mom.
You did do that.
Movies!
She can never remember the names of any movies she sees.
That is completely untrue.
Mike, tell them.
We were just talking about movies yesterday.
"The one with the actress who adopted the African-American baby, but not Charlize Theron, the one before her"
is not technically the name of a movie.
Face it, dad.
Her brain's cheese.
Maybe she should get a CAT scan.
I am not getting a CAT scan.
Oh, actually, mom, that's not a bad idea.
Last week, you left the groceries on the stoop all night long.
From what Myrtle says about her sister, Edna, once they start, it's a slippery slope till they go.
- Hmm.
- Oh, my God.
That'll be so sad.
- Dad's gonna fall apart.
- I'll be all right.
Yeah, dad'll be fine.
I know some lovely widows that would be all over that action.
He's not going for one of your bitties, Brick.
He's gonna have a lot of options.
[ Gasps ] Ooh!
Maybe he'll bring in someone to take care of us, and then he'll fall in love with her like Maria in "The Sound Of Music."
And, hey, maybe she'll actually be able to cook.
Our bodies would probably go into shock at first, but then it it would be great.
[ Laughter ]
Okay, that's enough.
Frankie, even if your mind is totally shot,
I promise I'm not marrying anybody.
I'm probably just gonna want to date around for a while.
[ Laughter ]
Frankie:
So while everyone was all over me,
Mike made it his job to make sure no one was all over Sue.
[ Sue laughs ]
He lifted the ban against boys in Sue's room on the one condition that her door stay open.
[ Sue laughs ]
The only problem with an open door is you could hear everything.
You want me to tickle your arm again?
Darrin:
No, I got a new game.
And the only thing worse than hearing everything is not hearing anything.
Oh, I love crazy eights.
But I've never played it that way before.
That's it.
No boys in the bedroom.
Okay, guys, hit the couch.
I am calling a family meeting.
[ Groans ] What am I even doing here?
I'm barely even a part of this family.
Frankie:
Um, I have an empty fridge and a clogged toilet that says otherwise.
Okay, here's the thing-- I've had an epiphany.
[ All groan ]
Let me guess-- you're old and your life isn't fulfilling.
You're taking back the house.
There's gonna be major changes.
You're not gonna yell anymore.
You're losing them, Frankie.
Look, the reason I wanted to talk to you is because although presented in a way that was not entirely kind,
I do think you guys brought up some interesting points the other day.
I mean, I have been losing it lately.
I can't remember things the way I used to.
And the reason that I can't remember squat is because of you people.
My brain can't think its own thoughts because it's got all your crap in there crowding out all the space.
There's an elephant in the room, and its name is menopause.
[ Sighs ]
I have to keep track of your orthodontist appointments and you need your notes faxed and can I please buy your old-lady snacks and, "Frankie, remind me.
We got to pay that whatever by Friday."
I'm tired of being your junk drawer.
You people have perfectly good brains capable of storing your own information, and instead, you dump it all into mine and it fills and it fills and it crowds out all my thoughts and that's how I end up losing my car.
- Hey, don't lump me in with them.
- Oh, you're lumped.
Look, the point is, it's not working anymore.
It's not working for me, and it's not working for you.
And that's why I'm establishing office hours.
- What's office hours?
- Huh?
- What does that even mean?
Frankie:
It means that from now on, every day between 5:00 and 6:00,
I will be sitting at the kitchen table with my undivided attention waiting to hear whatever crap you kids need from me.
So if you need something signed, a check written, a schedule changed, that would be the time to calmly make that request-- not screaming it at me as I'm running out of the house, or slipping a note under the bathroom door
while I'm on the toilet.
So we're not allowed to talk to you at all unless it's between 5:00 and 6:00?
Well, that would probably be more of a phase-two thing, but I like the way you're thinking.
Frankie:
Yep, I've had some low-grade, B-level epiphanies before, but I got to say, I knocked this one out of the park.
And I need you to move my scoliosis appointment on the 15th.
Brad and I are offering a free self-esteem workshop after school that day.
"Don't listen to the crowd.
You're great."
Hmm.
Okay.
Moving scoliosis appointment.
Anything else?
Yes, on Tuesday, I'm gonna need a ride to visit Sparkle in the hospital.
Bless her heart, she's getting her fourth knee.
Ohh.
Ride on Tuesday.
Got it.
Is that all?
No.
I also need a check.
Me and Hutch found this awesome apartment for next year.
Sue:
And don't forget I need you to sign my application for Miss Teen Orson.
Fingers crossed.
I inadvertently chewed a girl's hair, so you might be getting a call from my teacher about that.
Did you guys take out a credit card in my name?
We did it as Axl J Heck, so you should be fine.
We're not morons.
What else do you need?
Index cards.
More underwear.
Italian wedding cookies.
[ Car horn honks ]
Well, that's my ride to the Kay Kyser Big Band Experience.
Oh, don't wait up.
We might stop afterwards and get a little nosh.
Mike.
I came into the kitchen.
Yes.
I can see that.
And do you know why?
'Cause I do.
I am here to get a screwdriver, and I know what I'm gonna do with it.
I'm gonna use it to pry out that wad of q-tips from the bathroom drawer.
Hmm.
My locker combination from junior high-- 23-42-7.
The first actress that adopted the cute African-American baby was, oh, yeah, Sandra Bullock.
?
I'm all out of love ?
?
I'm so lost without you ?
Whoo!
I know all the lyrics now.
Ohh, my brain is mine again, Mike-- mine.
You have no idea how freeing this is.
Are you sure they're okay in the basement together?
I threw a tennis ball down the stairs to scare them, but what else can we do?
- What?
- Sue and Darrin.
They're downstairs.
Are we sure this is such a great idea?
Well, you didn't want them in the family room.
You didn't want them in Sue's room.
Where else are they supposed to go?
I don't know.
I don't like it, Frankie.
Look, you're the one that was all worked up about Sue and Darrin.
Now all of a sudden, you're not?
I don't know what to tell you Mike.
Maybe it's just with my mind clear,
I'm feeling more zen about the whole thing.
I'm just more centered now.
Well, you're definitely more annoying.
Well...
- [ Gasps ]
- What?
[ Gasps ]
- Let go!
- I'm trying!
You're ruining my favorite sweater!
Stupid swatch!
Huh?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Help!
Darrin:
Oh.
Hey, Mr. Heck.
Upstairs.
Now.
Listen, sir, I know that may have looked bad, but I want you to know that I have the utmost respect for your daughter.
Well, not just her, but you, too.
I mean, the reason I come here so much is because you make me feel so comfortable.
Then that's my fault if I've given you any impression that you should feel comfortable.
Here's what you need to know about you and me.
Think of it like a soccer game.
You're a player.
I'm the goalkeeper.
You can't use your hands.
I only play defense.
I'm the world's best goalkeeper, and I'm gonna do everything I can to stop you.
Bottom line-- you will not be scoring on me.
Got it?
I understand what you're saying, sir.
I guess I just want you to know that I care a lot about Sue and that I would never do anything to hurt her and that you can trust me.
[ Sighs ]
Here's all I need to know about you, Darrin-- you're 19 and a male.
I will never trust you.
Actually, I'm 20.
I skipped a grade.
That's the one where you repeat a year, right?
No, that's getting held back.
Oh, yeah.
That's the one I did.
Yeah.
Okay.
Sorry.
Sorry I'm late.
Whoo.
Shoot.
Well, after months of reading about clubs, wives, and counties, the book club is finally reading something I recommended-- "Planet Nowhere."
Your meter's running, Brick.
What do you need?
Well, I thought it would be fun, as part of our follow-up discussion, if I made Silligan noses for everyone to wear.
So can you scoot me over to the fabric store?
Sue:
Mom, you have to talk to dad.
He is being ridiculous.
He yelled at my boyfriend when we weren't even doing anything.
Axl:
Hey, what I have to say is way more important than whatever they're saying.
- Axl, it is not your turn!
- I was here first.
I'm screwed out of my apartment thanks to you.
What?
What are you talking about?
The landlord told me this morning he needed a deposit by 3:00 today, but I couldn't talk to you until 5:00 'cause of your stupid office hours.
And it was above a tanning salon.
Way to go, mom!
Axl, that is ridiculous.
If you needed that check by 3:00, you should have called me and told me.
But that's not what you said.
You said we could only talk to you during office hours.
- You keep changing the rules.
- I'm not changing the rules.
Obviously, if there's a real problem,
I will deal with it outside of office hours.
Well, how are we supposed to know that?
- Face it, this is all your fault!
- It is not my fault!
Axl, you are old enough to realize that--
You know what?
Forget it.
I'm done.
The office is closed.
- No.
- No, mom, wait, wait!
Sue, pick me up and follow her!
I need to talk to mom!
- Ohh, I'll pay you 10 bucks.
- Fine!
But that's on top of the $20 you already owe me from serving you dinner in the bathtub.
Mom, the least you could do is buy me a car 'cause I guess I'll be living in it!
Stop following me, Axl-
- I mean, Sue.
Hello?
I don't think I got a firm answer on the fabric store.
And I never got an answer if you're gonna talk to dad or not.
You know, Axl had girls over all the time, and he never confronted them.
Axl, tell her.
Tell her!
Tell her.
Tell her!
Okay, everybody just needs to calm down and give me a minute.
No, no, no.
This is our time now.
You can't take one of our minutes.
Come on, mom.
Silligan noses don't grow on trees.
Actually, they do in one book, but--
Mom, mom, just ignore these losers and listen to me!
Axl, stop interrupting!
Okay, Axl, you know what?
I am done with this.
Here, I am not carrying you anymore.
Brick, you carry him.
I don't want to carry him.
- I need everybody--
- Ohh!
[ Crashes ]
Dad?
Can I talk to you a sec?
Okay.
I want to know what you said to Darrin.
What I had to say to Darrin is between me and Darrin.
When Axl was dating Cassidy, did you talk to Cassidy and not tell Axl?
That was different.
How?
Look, Sue, there are just certain...
types of situations that I'm trying to help you avoid.
Like what types of situations?
- I don't know.
Just stuff.
- What stuff?
I don't know.
Just stuff.
Look, dad, if this is about kissing,
Darrin and I are going to kiss, okay?
That is what boyfriends and girlfriends do.
I know that.
That-- that-- that's not the stuff that I'm talking about.
Then what stuff?
What else do you think I would do?
Oh!
Oh!
My God!
Dad!
Do you even know me at all?
No.
That is not happening!
I am not ready for that.
Oh, okay.
Well, good, then.
And by the way, when it does eventually happen, it is not going to be in a basement.
It is going to be in front of a beautiful, roaring fire and a Christmas tree.
Ah... don't need the details.
[ Exhales sharply ]
Look, Sue, um...
I'm just flying by the seat of my pants here, okay?
I didn't have any sisters or anything, and, uh...
I guess whenever I thought of being a dad,
I didn't think of being a dad to a girl, so...
I guess I'm saying I'm gonna make mistakes, but I'm not gonna apologize for protecting my daughter, okay?
I'm-
- I'm just not.
Aw.
[ Chuckles ]
You know, dad, I'm okay.
I know you are.
It's me I'm kind of worried about.
Yeah, I know I'm late with the deposit, but if I drive up there after work, is there any chance that you would still accept it?
They're such great boys-- so reliable and respectful.
You're really gonna want them in your apartment.
Yeah, sure.
I'll hold.
Hey, Mike.
I'm writing an e-mail to the school to try to get Sue a new laptop.
How does this sound?
"So, as I pushed the woman out of the path of the oncoming bus..."
I think you used that for Axl's busted yearbook camera.
I did?
Ohh, no!
It's all slipping away!
The-- the clarity, the clear mind.
Mike, listen to me, there's Easter decorations
I bought last year on sale in the bottom of the closet.
Don't let me forget.
What else?
Think.
Think.
Oh, no.
It's gone.
It's all gone!
It was such a good system.
It should have worked.
See you on the other side, Frankie.
[ Sighs ] Oh, crap, I'm late for work.
Frankie:
Yep, there's no such thing as office hours when you've got kids.
That's just how parenting is.
It's always uncomfortable.
It's often a bad time.
And it's forever.
[ Indistinct conversations ]
Frankie?
What the hell are you doing here?
[ Sighs ]
[ Microwave beeps ] ?
I'm all out of love ?
[ Humming ]
Well, they don't get "Planet Nowhere" at all.
I had to explain the Silligans five times.
I mean, how hard is it to understand that their noses give them special powers, a precognition and echolocation.
And don't even get me started on Sorn.
They thought he needed to meet someone and settle down.
The leader of the Vernagle Army.
Can you believe it?
I don't get it...
We have nothing in common.
It's like we are from two different worlds!
Looks like I won't be needing these any more.
Dads is recorded in front of a live studio audience.
No.
What?
Tights aren't pants.
This is a workplace.
No, these are pants.
Were they in the underwear section or the pants section?
It's a Korean clothing store.
Everything's in one bin.
Oh.
I'll tell you what...
bring all your clothes over to my house tonight.
You can try everything on, and I'll tell you what's underwear and what isn't.
Mmm.
Perfect.
Then we can go buy clothes for you at Build-A-Bear.
Freedom!
Braveheart.
George Michael.
I prefer George Michael, but this time it's neither.
It's freedom from my dad.
Oh, my gosh, is this...?
Yes, it is.
Do-do you mean...?
I do.
And-and he...?
Uh-huh!
Will somebody just say a complete sentence?
Tights aren't pants.
(groans)
You look very happy right now.
I am happy, Eli.
(laughs)
I'm very happy.
You know why?
'Cause my dad's finally getting his ankle monitor bracelet off tonight.
Which means tomorrow, he gone.
VERONICA:
Wait.
Your dad has an ankle monitor bracelet?
Yeah, yeah.
Well, a few years ago, he got tricked into taking a job.
And then...
then he took the fall for all the illegal stuff they'd been doing.
How did they trick him into taking the job?
They said, "Crawford, would you like a job?"
Yeah.
So he's finally free to live wherever he wants.
And Camila and I can go back to having sex anywhere in the house.
But what about your kids?
Oh, no, they're cool.
They-they don't care about that stuff.
Well, wait, I mean, where's your dad gonna go?
I don't know.
You know, I figure
I put one of those umbrella hats on him and just drop him off at a national park.
Hey, you guys should come to the ankle monitor bracelet removal ceremony tonight.
ELI:
Oh!
I'm in.
Just being around a leaving dad gives me hope for the future.
Right?
Uh, I can't.
I have a date.
Oh, yeah?
Is he Asian?
No.
Racist.
♪ Daddy took me to the zoo
♪ Na, na, na, na ♪
♪ Just to see something brand-new ♪
♪ Na, na, na ♪
♪ So many stars up in the sky
♪ So many questions have I
♪ Na, na, na, na ♪
♪ Daddy took me for a ride.
Edna, what are you doing?
I clean these cobwebs off TV.
That's Spider-Man.
Hey, guys.
Oh, my God, Dad, have you moved at all today?
No.
But neither did Stephen Hawking.
You gonna go bug him?
All right, guys, I'm heading out.
Where you going?
I'm going to Warner's.
They are having a party because Crawford is leaving.
Can you say "leaving"?
Leaving?
Come on, Daddy, you can do it.
Leaving.
Oh, that's a good daddy!
I can't believe we're finally getting our house back.
I know.
I can't believe this is really happening.
I feel like we're watching an animal be released back into the wild.
That's it?
That's it.
You're free to go.
Go on, boy.
Go on.
You can do it.
(gasps)
(Crawford chuckles)
He probably smells my dad on me.
He'll be good to go in a day or two.
So... so that's it?
Done?
Yeah.
Oh, uh, unless you'd like to discuss some exciting new developments in the federal tax law.
No?
Okay.
Well, that's that.
Now to begin the long, arduous task of finding a new place to live.
Strap yourselves in, guys.
This could take weeks, months, maybe even...
Found it!
What?
Wow, look at that.
It's a senior condo facility.
With golf and-and tennis and...
Aw!
Look, they have one of those cats that climbs up on your lap when you're about to die.
What, you-you think I should live here?
Yeah, it'll be great.
Well, don't you think we should look at some other places or...?
Shh.
Hey.
Hey.
Crawford, you're free.
(laughs):
I'm free.
We're all free.
Warner!
Warner, she's hurting me!
Okay, stop.
Okay, Eli, get a Xanax and a People magazine.
Honey, stop it.
No, no, not the one with Tori Spelling on the cover.
They all have Tori Spelling on the cover!
(banging pan)
(groans)
Edna!
Could you please be quiet?
I really need to rest.
Okay, I be quiet!
(music sung in Spanish playing)
Edna, please!
What?
That no Edna.
That radio!
I'm gonna go up to my room.
I'm too weak to give a specific.
But coiderexican music insulted generally!
(turns up volume)
This is best part!
(whoops)
Arriba!
Arriba!
Arriba!
Dad!
Dad!
Edna, what happened?
He died.
What?
Oh, so sorry.
¿Cómo se dice?
He almost died.
Oh, my God!
Doc!
Doc!
Is he gonna be all right?
Wow.
You sounded like Marty McFly just then.
Now, uh, your dad has had what we doctors call an adult-sized bangeroo of a heart attack.
A heart attack?
Oh, my God.
Dad, please wake up.
I'm so sorry we were fighting.
We-we were arguing earlier.
Do you think that had anything to do with it?
Well, yeah.
Duh.
Boy, I really can't believe what happened to David, hmm?
You mean the heart attack?
No.
How fat he got.
Yeah, you could really see it in that hospital gown.
It is such a shame.
Yeah.
Well, it looks like you're almost packed.
Are-are you excited to finally get your own place and be the captain of your own ship?
I guess.
(laughing):
Oh, come on.
Oh, come on, this is gonna be good for you.
Look what happened to David.
You know, he's cooped up with Eli, and it-it's not healthy.
Don't you want to make new friends?
You're my friend.
I... of cour...
of course I'm your friend.
Yeah.
But I'm also your son.
And-and, you know, and that's... makes that impossible.
Oh, come...
You're gonna love this place.
That's funny.
I said exactly the same thing to you right before I accidentally shipped you off to that special-needs camp.
Oh.
Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I remember.
Boy, you brought back so many trophies.
Yeah.
Come on, Dad.
Come back.
(door opens)
How's he doing?
What?
Shouldn't you be telling me?
Okay, fine.
I guess I will just do everything around here.
Where did you go to medical school?
Um, a little school called Putnam Valley.
Heard of it?
No.
Everyone says that.
You've got a really terrible bedside manner.
And you are a tiny dad killer.
(door closes)
Oh, my God, Edna, what if he doesn't make it?
The last conversation we had was him asking me for help and me yelling at him.
What the hell is wrong with me?
I should've been a better son.
I mean, I know he wasn't always the greatest dad.
And yes, he is a completely self-obsessed egomaniacal baby.
That's why he's lived 65 years and doesn't have a single friend.
But this heart attack was my fault.
He extended his heart to me, and I literally broke it.
I just want to tell him how sorry I am.
Tell him that...
I love him.
Even if it means I get one of his disgusting kisses on the lips followed by the coffee and anchovy cross breeze.
It's whitefish, and I love you, too.
Dad!
Oh, my God, you're awake!
Edna, he's awake!
Edna!
Oh.
Hey.
Finally some peace and quiet without your dad.
Do you know how refreshing it is to open the refrigerator and not have bite marks in the cheese?
(laughs)
I know, it's so great having the place to ourselves, right?
Yeah.
Did you talk to him today?
Are you kidding me?
No.
I did...
No, of course not, no.
You know, I mean, I, you know,
I tried to call him a few times, and... sent him a few e-mails or whatever.
A few texts.
But other than that, no, I didn't...
I didn't think about him at all.
So, what do you want to do tonight?
I'm actually feeling kind of gassy.
I think I just gonna go upstairs and try.
Wish me luck.
Okay.
Yeah, good luck.
Oh, hey, be careful, you know.
Last time, you... you popped a blood vessel in your eye.
Don't tell me how to poop!
David, it's so wonderful that you're awake.
Don't say "wonderful" to another guy.
Hey, hey, David!
Crawford?
Oh.
There.
What is that for?
I bet him 20 bucks I'd have a heart attack before he did.
Hi.
Hey.
Remember me?
Yeah, I left you a few messages.
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.
You know, from the time I get up at 11:00 a.m. until 5:30 when we all go to bed, it is just activity, activity, activity, activity.
You know?
I see you got a-a cool headband tan.
Yeah, I thought I'd, uh, get back into playing tennis, and I'd start with the headband.
Ah!
Okay.
Here you go, Crawf.
Oh, hey, T.
Hey.
Ah, thank you.
Uh, gang, this is Todd.
Hey, guys.
Hi.
You-you work, uh... you work at the condo?
Yeah, Todd has been like a son to me.
In fact, Warner,
I want to thank you for kicking me out.
I've really gotten to love this new community and-and my new friend Todd.
I think I can finally make a life there.
Well, I-I'm glad we're all happy.
You bet.
Yeah.
Crawford, we should go.
Oh!
Yeah, right, we left our golf cart in the ambulance space.
Oh, my God, David, you're okay!
I'm so sorry.
I got here as soon as I could.
As soon as you could?
He's been here three days.
(Veronica sighs)
Sorry.
I was away for the weekend in Big Sur.
What were you doing there?
My dad almost died.
Well, actually...
I got engaged.
(quiet laugh)
(squealing):
Oh, my...
Engaged?
But what about us?
Us?
There's no us.
Hey...
(stammers)
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna... (whistles)
Yeah, okay.
(door opens and closes)
Pretend I'm not here.
Engaged?
(chuckles)
I didn't...
How-how long have you had a boyfriend?
Six months.
Six months?
Wow.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why would I?
Ooh.
Be-Because... well, well, because we're friends, right?
Um, so, what's his name?
Uh, his name is Colt.
Is he a horse?
In a way.
Look, I know we haven't been seeing each other long, but when you know, you know.
(both laugh)
That's great.
That's great.
Do you have a problem with this?
No.
I'm just surprised.
I'm just so surprised.
That's all.
Of course, I'm-I'm happy for you.
Thanks.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
(both laugh)
DAVID:
Just a hug?
What a wuss.
(droning beep, man groaning)
Wrong guy.
So, Veronica and Colt, huh?
(groans) Colt.
What a terrible name!
So, your dad and Todd, huh?
Todd!
You know, I-I Googled his name, and all this creepy stuff came up.
Probably 'cause I didn't have his last name, but...
Hey, guys.
Uh, this is my boyfriend.
Uh, my fiancée.
Weird!
Weird!
Uh, my fiancée Colt.
Uh, Colt, this is Warner and Eli.
Hey.
Hey.
Wow.
Uh, I cannot believe I'm meeting Eli Sachs.
My head is just like... (imitates an explosion)
Uh, it's such an honor.
What?
Really?
You're a legend.
I read about you in Gamer Weekly back in '08.
Oh, yeah?
You came across so smart and funny.
(laughs) Well, thanks.
That joke you made about, uh, h-having a business partner is like swimming the English Channel with a dead guy strapped to you neck?
(all three laughing)
Dude, that was epic.
Dead guy, yeah...
Wait, what?
I can't tell you...
I'm so jealous Veronica gets to work here with you.
Yeah, she's very lucky.
Oh, hey, um,
I heard you're a fan of vintage pinball machines?
A big fan.
You should come over.
I got a vintage
Elton John Captain Fantastic machine in the garage.
Whoa!
Yeah, it is so old, he's actually ogling women in it.
(laughs) Wow, that's so cool.
Thanks.
Uh, you...
Colt and I should really get going.
Oh, I just got here!
Oh, he just got here!
I know, but we have so much wedding stuff to do.
We have to find a venue, register.
Register?
What is he... a sex offender?
(both laugh) Nice one!
(laughs)
All right, come on.
Let's go.
All right, well, we'll talk!
Yeah, yeah, no, okay.
And ball out!
Right on, man, we'll play... we'll play some pinball!
All right.
(laughs)
I hate him.
(rain pattering)
(thunder rumbling)
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Are you all right, sweetie?
Yeah.
Why?
You cried during sex at a different time than you usually do.
I was just...
I was just thinking about my dad.
Okay, um, that's disturbing.
No.
No, I was just...
I was just thinking about him not being here.
But...
I thought that's what we wanted, right?
Yeah.
Uh, of course, but, you know, now that he's gone, I'm just...
I just...
I'm just...
I started to realize that, uh...
What?
You know, I just...
I just... miss having him around, I guess, uh...
I mean, you know, I know...
I know he can be a pain in the bum, and... pardon my language, but-but, uh...
But, you know, I-I love my dad, you know?
And I-I just...
I just don't want him living in a...
in a retirement condo.
With Todd.
So...?
What are you saying?
Uh... (stammers)
I want...
I want my dad back.
Well, if you really want him back, then I guess we'll make it work.
Really?
Yes, really.
Babe, if it makes you happy, then, of course, I'm on board 100%.
It makes me happy.
I love you.
I love you.
Now, go, go!
Okay, okay.
You're-you're gonna want something for this, aren't you?
Yes.
A Kobe-Bryant-forget-about- those-rape-charges diamond.
Hey, Dad, how you feeling?
Jewish.
What are you doing there?
I'm writing an alphabetical list of all the people I should apologize to before I die.
Did you put the cast of Menopause The Musical on there?
Kidding?
They owe me an apology.
(laughs)
Well, I'm glad you're feeling better.
Eli?
Listen to me.
I realized why I get angry at everybody.
It's because I lived a life of regret.
I don't want you to make the same mistake as me.
I haven't.
You sure?
Why don't you tell her?
Tell who?
You know, Veronica.
Veronica?
Yeah.
The Oriental.
You want to... you're gonna want to go ahead and put her name down on that list, too.
She's engaged, Dad.
What am I supposed to do?
If I knew that... (chokes up)
I wouldn't need this list.
You'll figure it out.
You're smart.
You're smarter than I ever was.
Thanks, Dad.
Mm-wah!
(groans)
Now, go.
You go get her, Mr. Eli!
Yeah?
You sure she's the one?
She Chinese with boobs.
Yeah, she the one!
(thunder rumbling)
Veronica!
Dad!
Indian food!
(laughs)
Dad!
(banging on door) Dad!
Dad!
Warner?
!
What the hell are you doing here?
I came to bring you home, Dad.
Warner, this is my home now.
Dad, I'm-I'm not gonna let you cripple me emotionally and financially, and then just walk away.
Excuse me, visiting hours...
Oh, stuff it, Todd!
Come on, Dad, let's go home.
(chuckles)
That's my son.
All right!
WARNER:
Thank you.
MAN:
Way to go, Crawford!
Way to go!
Oh, no.
(indistinct chatter)
Hey, dad.
I'm here to help you pack up.
Okay.
I think I'm gonna come out to Joshy next.
Okay.
Do you want me to be with you?
No, I'll do...
I'll do it alone.
Alright, well, I'll just have him come over here, then.
- Do you think he's ready?
- No, you never are.
It's like having a baby.
You know, just one day the baby shows up and you figure it out.
- Honey?
- What?
Are you okay with me?
Oh, God, yes.
- No, I'm happy.
- Yeah?
Yeah, it's... it's...
It's inspiring.
I mean, I'm so glad you get to be who you are.
That's what we should all be.
Not my business, but how long have you and Tammy been carrying on?
Not my business.
I can't stop thinking about her.
I... it's like... it's just, like, we just reconnected, after all this time, and it just happened.
Now we're just, like, connecting every second.
I cannot stop texting her.
You know, it's like, "What are you doing? "
"Eating a sandwich."
"How is it?" "It's amazing."
You know... the thing that you do when you're falling in love?
Not really.
So you're not in love with Len?
No.
I mean, whatever.
I mean, I...
I...
I'm...
I'm staying with Len.
I'm gonna stay with Len.
I'm happy to stay with Len.
I just... you know, I just wonder, you know, what would it feel like to be loved by someone who's actually moved by loving you?
Why don't you tell him what you want?
I don't want to have to tell someone.
That is... that is the whole...
You can't tell someone that.
Mm.
Which one of you are gonna take the encyclopedias?
None of us, dad.
Nobody in the world wants those.
These are the bicentennial encyclopedias.
Ugh.
Would it be okay with you if I just crashed here tonight?
Of course, sweetie.
But I wanted you to know that I was thinking about you, and...
I really loved your message earlier, so...
Please leave me more, 'cause when I hear your voice,
I feel better.
Okay, guess I'll go.
I'm sorry I keep calling you.
Hey, Kaya.
Don't know why you're not calling me back, and I'm sick of getting your voicemail, so, anyhoo, maybe you might want to think about answering your phone and saying hello?

One second, you guys.
What's up?
Where the fuck is Kaya?
She's not answering my calls.
- She's not answering my texts.
- I don't know, dude.
- Is she avoiding me?
- I couldn't tell you.
Did she not tell you that we might be getting married?
- Married?
- Yeah.
- I love her.
I proposed, okay?
- Oh, my God.
You weird, old, sad fellow.
Married?
Are you living in a fucking dream world?
Are you such a fetus that you've not been in love before?
- Yeah, like a million times.
- Thank you.
Why don't you help me out and make her call me back and make sure she's here for the meeting with Ryan.
- What do you want?
- You got to get over here, asap, 'cause dad's got me packing up all his crap to donate to Haddasah League, and it's now or never.
Um, no, I can't do that today.
What about the cereal boxes?
Do not think about touching those or opening those.
Yeah, it's too late, actually, for that, 'cause I already did.
Nice photos and letters of you and creepy Rita.
I almost forgot about you and the babysitter.
Okay.
A... okay, you know what?
Um, I'm coming.
Those the moon rocks?
You got 'em?
- Yeah.
- Can I see 'em?
Yes.
Okay, there they are.
- So it's just like "E, " really?
- Yeah.
But you know how with "E", you, like, you have to take Xanax when you're coming down, otherwise your brain hurts?
What?
No, nobody's ever told me that.
Great, I've been taking my ecstasy wrong for years.
Okay, so what's the plan?
I got Saturday and Sunday off.
Do you want to go Joshua Tree, which I realized I haven't been to since I was a kid?
I'm so sorry.
I feel like a jerk.
I had a plan that was, like, a sex thing.
And I didn't tell you that, that that was what I wanted to do with the guy from the park?
What guy from the park?
The trainer from the park.
You're hanging out with that guy?
Yeah, I went back, and like, we trained, and then we started fucking, and whatever.
And then I met his roommate, who is crazy sexy, and I'm planning a little spit-roasting epic... night.
What is spit-roasting?
That sounds disgusting.
Do you really not know what spit-roasting is?
Um, I know it in relation to food.
- God, don't you watch porn?
- I don't know.
I find it kind of disturbing, don't you?
Sorry.
Hold on.
Okay, so imagine that this is me.
I am the candle, the white-hot, burning candle, and this pepper shaker is one guy, and this... imagine this was a pepper shaker, too.
This is the other guy.
- Okay, so his roommate's black.
- Oh, yeah.
That's very classic Ali.
This pepper shaker's investigating my vagina from the behind, and this pepper shaker is investigating my mouth, and I... am roasting.
You're gross.
I know.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Joshy's on his way.
- Oh, good.
What is this?
What's all this?
Oh, this is all I'm taking.
- This is it?
- Yeah.
I mean,
I just got up in the middle of the night, and I went, "You know, it's just stuff, right?"
all I need is a safe place to rest my keppie.
Oh, it's Joshy.
No, no.
That's...
That's the moving truck.
He'll be here soon.
Are you... are you sure you're okay?
Coming out is coming out is coming out.
I'm good.
Okay.
Love you.
Hey, dad, I'm here.
Dad?
- Dad!
- Yeah.
- Hey.
- Hey, thanks for coming.
Sarah told me.
Oh...
Listen, uh, can I get you some, uh, I don't know, tea?
I have, uh, soda.
I have water, I...
I know that.
I'm not...
I'm not making you late for work, am I?
Um, it's not the mill, dad.
Oh, okay.
Do you want to help me carry some of this stuff to the car?
- These?
- Yeah.
Why didn't you tell me?
What... what?
You smell like the perfume aisle at a sav-on in the Philippines.
You've got a girlfriend.
Who is she?
Who... you're moving in with her?
It's... eh... it's complicated.
Yeah, I'll bet it's complicated.
You want this in your car?
Yeah, and if I can tell from the scent, she's about 30 years younger than you and a bit of a freak.
- Am I right?
- She's not a freak.
That's last month's issue.
You know, you... you could get a... a post office box.
Uh, my wife does the bills.
Mine too.
Look at me.
I'm...
I'm full of bad advice.
You know what you can do?
You can just stick it in an issue of deck and patio or...

I want the Charleston Chew.
No, you have too many cavities.
Trade you my Abba-Zaba.

No, my friend gave them to me.
She had some extra.

They're supposed to be better than "E," 'cause they're, like, pure MDMA.
Yeah, this shit sits in your spine.
No, no, no, no, no.
That stuff is pure, and... and there's, like, a really easy comedown.

Hey, Mike!
Wanna get high with us?
What you got?
What's up?
- Hey, Josh.
- Hey.
Barry's looking for ya.
He's in the conference room.
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You got a sec?
- Um, I'm kind of in a hurry.
- Ryan's here.
- Oh.
We're gonna talk through the remaster with Kaya and Margaux.
Yeah, yeah.
No, this'll just be a minute.
Pop a squat, 'cause I want you to meet, uh, the Drug Mules.
- What's up?
- Hey, what's up?
Uh, I reached out to you about them a while ago.
I caught them at south-by, and I just went ape balls.
It's totally your wheelhouse, by the way, brother.
Um, I'm in the middle of setting up a tour right now.
So, I highly doubt I'm gonna have the time, you know?
So actually, um, I'm gonna have Glenda wrangle Glitterish for a minute, just a little moving and shaking real quick, and I'm gonna have you jump in with these guys, and, um, we'll talk about the details later, okay?
I think we're gonna talk about it right fucking now.
Is... is this about Kaya?
What did she say to you?
Because if she told you to fire me,
- Uh-huh.
- I got a right to know.
- Do you know what I'm talking about?
- Sit down.
Everything's actually totally chill.
Barry, what did she say?
Why don't you take a look at those bagels,
- and you need to get to know...
- Hey, Barry.
- That fruit salad real fast.
- Sit the fuck down.
We're not having this talk right now.
- What did she say to you?
- She said she didn't feel fucking safe... can we talk about it fucking later?
- She doesn't feel safe with me?
- Can we talk about this
- fucking later, bro?
- What does that even mean?
I'm the one that discovered Glitterish.
I'm the one that was there the night they played the roxy the first time, and you were the one who didn't want to sign them.
- I protected her from you...
- Dude.
And now you're gonna fucking fire me from the...
- Fuck that shit!
- Back... back... back... back.
You just got fired, bro!
Hi.
Hey.
I got a... an hour, a whole hour, just for you.
I cancelled the Grubman thing.
I just made up some bullshit.
So do you want to tell me what's going on?
I don't know...
I'm just...
I...
It's, like, riddled with anxiety, lately.
It's like...
It's kind of like...
Anxious exhaustion.
I heard this guy call it that on the radio just, like...
I'm overwhelmed all the time.
You're overwhelmed all the time?
H-how?
How are you overwhelmed?
'Cause we have Sylvia full-time.
I don't know if you're actually aware, but, um, I manage Sylvia, and, uh, and I'm on, like, four committees at Ivanhoe, and the parent outreach at the " J"...
I'm actually training for a triathlon.
I have to swim in the ocean to raise money for breast cancer, because I hope one day if I have breast cancer, somebody swims for me.
Babe...
Are you okay?
Like... do you feel okay?
Oh, my God.
I don't want you to be mad at me.
I'm not mad.
Ugh!
Okay, you know that co-op in college that I worked at?
I didn't tell you that I also lived there.
- I think you told me that.
- I did?
Okay, well, but I didn't tell you that I...
that... that I lived there... with... with Tammy.
Ohh...
Like, in my... in my... in my room with her.
In my bed, actually.
I was in love with her, Len.
I... am in love with her.
Well, I'm gonna call Dr. Schomberg,
- 'cause we haven't...
- No.
talked to anyone in a long time.
- Len, no.
- Yeah, I'm calling her right now.
No.
This doesn't... this has nothing to do with...
This isn't us.
This is me.
Len...
- We're gonna talk to her.
- It's me.
I'll get us an appointment, and we can talk to her.
Len, it's me.
It's me.
You're not allowed to do this, you know.
I don't know how not to.
I just came from Barry's.
I'm gonna have to call you back, okay, dad?
What is going on?
Tell me you did not tell him to fire me.
Yeah, I told him to fire you.
I mean, my God, what was I supposed to do?
I mean, you wouldn't drop the whole baby thing.
Yeah!
It's a big deal.
I don't know if you can appreciate this, but this is a fucking big deal for me.
I've been fucking shit up my whole life.
I'm trying to do the right thing.
By right thing you mean we live in the mountains, and I run around with milk spewing out of my boobs?
Okay, that was a stupid idea.
Because you care about me so much, Josh?
It was a stupid idea.
I'm sorry.
Josh, this is only the second time you've even been to my house, okay?
And it's not like I live in Venice.
Echo Park and Silver Lake are...
I don't even know where one stops and the other starts.
Okay, rampart.
Look...
You never asked me to come here.
I would come here if you asked me to.
A normal guy just comes.
Okay.
I'm here now.
I'm here now, and I will continue to come.
Um, I'm going in, and you're not invited.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Okay...
- Don't...
Kaya, how'd this happen?
Okay, look, we have a baby in there, and I don't think you realize how important that is.
I already had the abortion.
When?
Yesterday.
Took, like, four Tylenol.
I was totally fine.
I couldn't do it.
I just chickened out with Josh.
I'm really sorry about that.
- Boys are the hardest.
- Boys are the hardest.
- They are.
- Why?
Well, because they...
They never stop really seeing you as their father, and girls are just easier that way.
I think they're more sensitive.
Why don't we go out, huh?
Where?
Well, you know, we'll find some place in Weho, and we'll just go drink.
I have to come out to Ali.
Nothing feels right until I do that.
Mike, I need three glasses of water, please.
Shit's about to get weird.
Okay, if I get too crazy, you guys have to be my guides.
Really?
You think you can handle the two of us?
Oh, please.
You know I've been working out.
Ooh, we got a live one.
For you.
Bottoms up, freaks.
Ah.
Um, guys, that was actually just cyanide that we took.
I'm just kidding!
Hey, you've reached Tammy Cashman.
You know what to do, so do it.
Babe, I did it.
I left Len.
Oh, my God.
You know what?
I actually...
I think it's gonna be okay.
I think he's gonna be okay.
I just have to... tell the kids.
I'm...
I'm taking them to my dad's tomorrow.
Should I tell them tomorrow?
Oh, God, I don't know.
Where are you, honey?
I need to talk to you.
Will you call me, please?
Mm, I feel like I'm spooning a bear.
Ugh, this is how the cave women felt.
You know what you look like?
A cat.
Like a feral cat.
I had a cat when I was a kid.
We used to be kids.
Derek, Derek.
You're too far away from us.
- Why are you so far away?
- I don't know, I just...
I'm so fucking thirsty.
You should kiss me.
I'm 70% water.
Hi, Mike.
You're making me naked.
Mike's making me naked.
Ooh, is that my pussy?
- Yeah, that's your pussy.
- Where're you going?
I'm gonna give Mike your pussy so then Mike has Derek's pussy, 'cause I'm the vessel for you guys...
- What?
- So that you have to be in this room, fucking each other...
What?
- Because that's...
- No.
What you really want to be doing.
- No.
No.
- You really wanna be
- loving each other.
- What?
That'll do it.
This is your bitch.
- Is this the wrong one?
- Ohh...
But why do I have to leave?
Hello.
I hope Mike's okay.
Is Mike okay?
Bye.
Hi.
Hello.
I love your car.
It's so pretty.
I think this is what it must feel like to be in the womb, but you probably can't do this with your arms.
You have such a pretty face.
Ha.
Where do you come from?
I come from Armenia.
Oh, is your whole family there?
- Yes.
- Are you sad about that?
Being alive is being sad.
Can I have a candy bar?
Yes, of course.
They're for customer, like you.
My business card is back there, too.
Maybe I can take you to the airport or something sometime, you know?
Your name is Tigran.
Ahh...
You would just go and buy these candies just for the people who ride in your car?
Of course.
I just go to the Costco.
That is so incredibly nice of you that you go all the way to the Costco to buy us these candies.
And I am so sorry about the Armenian genocide.
Thank you, Tigran.
Listen, I hope you will give me five stars, eh?
You got it!
Five stars, all the way.
Be careful.
Hi, daddy.
You want to come visit me?
Yes, now is the perfect time.
I would love that!
Hey, dad.
I'm here to help you pack up.
Okay.
I think I'm gonna come out to Joshy next.
Okay.
Do you want me to be with you?
No, I'll do...
I'll do it alone.
Alright, well, I'll just have him come over here, then.
- Do you think he's ready?
- No, you never are.
It's like having a baby.
You know, just one day the baby shows up and you figure it out.
- Honey?
- What?
Are you okay with me?
Oh, God, yes.
- No, I'm happy.
- Yeah?
Yeah, it's... it's...
It's inspiring.
I mean, I'm so glad you get to be who you are.
That's what we should all be.
Not my business, but how long have you and Tammy been carrying on?
Not my business.
I can't stop thinking about her.
I... it's like... it's just, like, we just reconnected, after all this time, and it just happened.
Now we're just, like, connecting every second.
I cannot stop texting her.
You know, it's like, "What are you doing? "
"Eating a sandwich."
"How is it?" "It's amazing."
You know... the thing that you do when you're falling in love?
Not really.
So you're not in love with Len?
No.
I mean, whatever.
I mean, I...
I...
I'm...
I'm staying with Len.
I'm gonna stay with Len.
I'm happy to stay with Len.
I just... you know, I just wonder, you know, what would it feel like to be loved by someone who's actually moved by loving you?
Why don't you tell him what you want?
I don't want to have to tell someone.
That is... that is the whole...
You can't tell someone that.
Mm.
Which one of you are gonna take the encyclopedias?
None of us, dad.
Nobody in the world wants those.
These are the bicentennial encyclopedias.
Ugh.
Would it be okay with you if I just crashed here tonight?
Of course, sweetie.
But I wanted you to know that I was thinking about you, and...
I really loved your message earlier, so...
Please leave me more, 'cause when I hear your voice,
I feel better.
Okay, guess I'll go.
I'm sorry I keep calling you.
Hey, Kaya.
Don't know why you're not calling me back, and I'm sick of getting your voicemail, so, anyhoo, maybe you might want to think about answering your phone and saying hello?
What's your ish?
* What do you want, Josh?
*
Come here.
Let's go.
* I'm in the middle of rehearsal *
Come on.
Fine.
One second, you guys.
What's up?
Where the fuck is Kaya?
She's not answering my calls.
- She's not answering my texts.
- I don't know, dude.
- Is she avoiding me?
- I couldn't tell you.
Did she not tell you that we might be getting married?
- Married?
- Yeah.
- I love her.
I proposed, okay?
- Oh, my God.
You weird, old, sad fellow.
Married?
Are you living in a fucking dream world?
Are you such a fetus that you've not been in love before?
- Yeah, like a million times.
- Thank you.
Why don't you help me out and make her call me back and make sure she's here for the meeting with Ryan.
- What do you want?
- You got to get over here, asap, 'cause dad's got me packing up all his crap to donate to Haddasah League, and it's now or never.
Um, no, I can't do that today.
What about the cereal boxes?
Do not think about touching those or opening those.
Yeah, it's too late, actually, for that, 'cause I already did.
Nice photos and letters of you and creepy Rita.
I almost forgot about you and the babysitter.
Okay.
A... okay, you know what?
Um, I'm coming.
Those the moon rocks?
You got 'em?
- Yeah.
- Can I see 'em?
Yes.
Okay, there they are.
- So it's just like "E, " really?
- Yeah.
But you know how with "E", you, like, you have to take Xanax when you're coming down, otherwise your brain hurts?
What?
No, nobody's ever told me that.
Great, I've been taking my ecstasy wrong for years.
Okay, so what's the plan?
I got Saturday and Sunday off.
Do you want to go Joshua Tree, which I realized I haven't been to since I was a kid?
I'm so sorry.
I feel like a jerk.
I had a plan that was, like, a sex thing.
And I didn't tell you that, that that was what I wanted to do with the guy from the park?
What guy from the park?
The trainer from the park.
You're hanging out with that guy?
Yeah, I went back, and like, we trained, and then we started fucking, and whatever.
And then I met his roommate, who is crazy sexy, and I'm planning a little spit-roasting epic... night.
What is spit-roasting?
That sounds disgusting.
Do you really not know what spit-roasting is?
Um, I know it in relation to food.
- God, don't you watch porn?
- I don't know.
I find it kind of disturbing, don't you?
Sorry.
Hold on.
Okay, so imagine that this is me.
I am the candle, the white-hot, burning candle, and this pepper shaker is one guy, and this... imagine this was a pepper shaker, too.
This is the other guy.
- Okay, so his roommate's black.
- Oh, yeah.
That's very classic Ali.
This pepper shaker's investigating my vagina from the behind, and this pepper shaker is investigating my mouth, and I... am roasting.
You're gross.
I know.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Joshy's on his way.
- Oh, good.
What is this?
What's all this?
Oh, this is all I'm taking.
- This is it?
- Yeah.
I mean,
I just got up in the middle of the night, and I went, "You know, it's just stuff, right?"
all I need is a safe place to rest my keppie.
Oh, it's Joshy.
No, no.
That's...
That's the moving truck.
He'll be here soon.
Are you... are you sure you're okay?
Coming out is coming out is coming out.
I'm good.
Okay.
Love you.
Hey, dad, I'm here.
Dad?
- Dad!
- Yeah.
- Hey.
- Hey, thanks for coming.
Sarah told me.
Oh...
Listen, uh, can I get you some, uh, I don't know, tea?
I have, uh, soda.
I have water, I...
I know that.
I'm not...
I'm not making you late for work, am I?
Um, it's not the mill, dad.
Oh, okay.
Do you want to help me carry some of this stuff to the car?
- These?
- Yeah.
Why didn't you tell me?
What... what?
You smell like the perfume aisle at a sav-on in the Philippines.
You've got a girlfriend.
Who is she?
Who... you're moving in with her?
It's... eh... it's complicated.
Yeah, I'll bet it's complicated.
You want this in your car?
Yeah, and if I can tell from the scent, she's about 30 years younger than you and a bit of a freak.
- Am I right?
- She's not a freak.
That's last month's issue.
You know, you... you could get a... a post office box.
Uh, my wife does the bills.
- Mine too.
Look at me.
I'm...
I'm full of bad advice.
You know what you can do?
You can just stick it in an issue of deck and patio or...
Outdoor living magazine.
- I'm Mark.
- Mort.
- Did you get it?
- Okay.
So who would like a Charleston Chew?
- Ooh, me, please.
- All right.
Who wants a Abba-Zaba?
- I'll take that.
- You want that?
I want the Charleston Chew.
No, you have too many cavities.
Trade you my Abba-Zaba.
- I don't like peanut butter.
- No!
- Give it to me.
- No, stop!
- Hey, hey.
- Give it!
- No, stop it!
- Hey, hey, hey!
I don't want to hear a peep out of you.
Looky, looky, look.
These are the moon rocks.
Yeah, that looks like crack.
No, my friend gave them to me.
She had some extra.
They're amazing.
They're supposed to be better than "E," 'cause they're, like, pure MDMA.
Yeah, this shit sits in your spine.
No, no, no, no, no.
That stuff is pure, and... and there's, like, a really easy comedown.
The government even gives it to Iraq vets who are recovering from PTSD.
It's like...
We should definitely do what the government does.
Uncle Sam wants you to roll with Ali.
- That's cute.
- Could be fun.
Should we ask Mike?
Nm-mm.
Hey, Mike!
Wanna get high with us?
What you got?
What's up?
- Hey, Josh.
- Hey.
Barry's looking for ya.
He's in the conference room.
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You got a sec?
- Um, I'm kind of in a hurry.
- Ryan's here.
- Oh.
We're gonna talk through the remaster with Kaya and Margaux.
Yeah, yeah.
No, this'll just be a minute.
Pop a squat, 'cause I want you to meet, uh, the Drug Mules.
- What's up?
- Hey, what's up?
Uh, I reached out to you about them a while ago.
I caught them at south-by, and I just went ape balls.
It's totally your wheelhouse, by the way, brother.
Um, I'm in the middle of setting up a tour right now.
So, I highly doubt I'm gonna have the time, you know?
So actually, um, I'm gonna have Glenda wrangle Glitterish for a minute, just a little moving and shaking real quick, and I'm gonna have you jump in with these guys, and, um, we'll talk about the details later, okay?
I think we're gonna talk about it right fucking now.
Is... is this about Kaya?
What did she say to you?
Because if she told you to fire me,
- Uh-huh.
- I got a right to know.
- Do you know what I'm talking about?
- Sit down.
Everything's actually totally chill.
Barry, what did she say?
Why don't you take a look at those bagels,
- and you need to get to know...
- Hey, Barry.
- That fruit salad real fast.
- Sit the fuck down.
We're not having this talk right now.
- What did she say to you?
- She said she didn't feel fucking safe... can we talk about it fucking later?
- She doesn't feel safe with me?
- Can we talk about this
- fucking later, bro?
- What does that even mean?
I'm the one that discovered Glitterish.
I'm the one that was there the night they played the roxy the first time, and you were the one who didn't want to sign them.
- I protected her from you...
- Dude.
And now you're gonna fucking fire me from the...
- Fuck that shit!
- Back... back... back... back.
You just got fired, bro!
Hi.
Hey.
I got a... an hour, a whole hour, just for you.
I cancelled the Grubman thing.
I just made up some bullshit.
So do you want to tell me what's going on?
I don't know...
I'm just...
I...
It's, like, riddled with anxiety, lately.
It's like...
It's kind of like...
Anxious exhaustion.
I heard this guy call it that on the radio just, like...
I'm overwhelmed all the time.
You're overwhelmed all the time?
H-how?
How are you overwhelmed?
'Cause we have Sylvia full-time.
I don't know if you're actually aware, but, um, I manage Sylvia, and, uh, and I'm on, like, four committees at Ivanhoe, and the parent outreach at the " J"...
I'm actually training for a triathlon.
I have to swim in the ocean to raise money for breast cancer, because I hope one day if I have breast cancer, somebody swims for me.
Babe...
Are you okay?
Like... do you feel okay?
Oh, my God.
I don't want you to be mad at me.
I'm not mad.
Ugh!
Okay, you know that co-op in college that I worked at?
I didn't tell you that I also lived there.
- I think you told me that.
- I did?
Okay, well, but I didn't tell you that I...
that... that I lived there... with... with Tammy.
Ohh...
Like, in my... in my... in my room with her.
In my bed, actually.
I was in love with her, Len.
I... am in love with her.
Well, I'm gonna call Dr. Schomberg,
- 'cause we haven't...
- No.
talked to anyone in a long time.
- Len, no.
- Yeah, I'm calling her right now.
No.
This doesn't... this has nothing to do with...
This isn't us.
This is me.
Len...
- We're gonna talk to her.
- It's me.
I'll get us an appointment, and we can talk to her.
Len, it's me.
It's me.
You're not allowed to do this, you know.
I don't know how not to.
I just came from Barry's.
I'm gonna have to call you back, okay, dad?
What is going on?
Tell me you did not tell him to fire me.
Yeah, I told him to fire you.
I mean, my God, what was I supposed to do?
I mean, you wouldn't drop the whole baby thing.
Yeah!
It's a big deal.
I don't know if you can appreciate this, but this is a fucking big deal for me.
I've been fucking shit up my whole life.
I'm trying to do the right thing.
By right thing you mean we live in the mountains, and I run around with milk spewing out of my boobs?
Okay, that was a stupid idea.
Because you care about me so much, Josh?
It was a stupid idea.
I'm sorry.
Josh, this is only the second time you've even been to my house, okay?
And it's not like I live in Venice.
Echo Park and Silver Lake are...
I don't even know where one stops and the other starts.
Okay, rampart.
Look...
You never asked me to come here.
I would come here if you asked me to.
A normal guy just comes.
Okay.
I'm here now.
I'm here now, and I will continue to come.
Um, I'm going in, and you're not invited.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Okay...
- Don't...
Kaya, how'd this happen?
Okay, look, we have a baby in there, and I don't think you realize how important that is.
I already had the abortion.
When?
Yesterday.
Took, like, four Tylenol.
I was totally fine.
I couldn't do it.
I just chickened out with Josh.
I'm really sorry about that.
- Boys are the hardest.
- Boys are the hardest.
- They are.
- Why?
Well, because they...
They never stop really seeing you as their father, and girls are just easier that way.
I think they're more sensitive.
Why don't we go out, huh?
Where?
Well, you know, we'll find some place in Weho, and we'll just go drink.
I have to come out to Ali.
Nothing feels right until I do that.
Mike, I need three glasses of water, please.
Shit's about to get weird.
Okay, if I get too crazy, you guys have to be my guides.
Really?
You think you can handle the two of us?
Oh, please.
You know I've been working out.
Ooh, we got a live one.
For you.
Bottoms up, freaks.
Ah.
Um, guys, that was actually just cyanide that we took.
I'm just kidding!
Hey, you've reached Tammy Cashman.
You know what to do, so do it.
Babe, I did it.
I left Len.
Oh, my God.
You know what?
I actually...
I think it's gonna be okay.
I think he's gonna be okay.
I just have to... tell the kids.
I'm...
I'm taking them to my dad's tomorrow.
Should I tell them tomorrow?
Oh, God, I don't know.
Where are you, honey?
I need to talk to you.
Will you call me, please?
Mm, I feel like I'm spooning a bear.
Ugh, this is how the cave women felt.
You know what you look like?
A cat.
Like a feral cat.
I had a cat when I was a kid.
We used to be kids.
Derek, Derek.
You're too far away from us.
- Why are you so far away?
- I don't know, I just...
I'm so fucking thirsty.
You should kiss me.
I'm 70% water.
Hi, Mike.
You're making me naked.
Mike's making me naked.
Ooh, is that my pussy?
- Yeah, that's your pussy.
- Where're you going?
I'm gonna give Mike your pussy so then Mike has Derek's pussy, 'cause I'm the vessel for you guys...
- What?
- So that you have to be in this room, fucking each other...
What?
- Because that's...
- No.
What you really want to be doing.
- No.
No.
- You really wanna be
- loving each other.
- What?
That'll do it.
This is your bitch.
- Is this the wrong one?
- Ohh...
But why do I have to leave?
Hello.
I hope Mike's okay.
Is Mike okay?
Bye.
Hi.
Hello.
I love your car.
It's so pretty.
I think this is what it must feel like to be in the womb, but you probably can't do this with your arms.
You have such a pretty face.
Ha.
Where do you come from?
I come from Armenia.
Oh, is your whole family there?
- Yes.
- Are you sad about that?
Being alive is being sad.
Can I have a candy bar?
Yes, of course.
They're for customer, like you.
My business card is back there, too.
Maybe I can take you to the airport or something sometime, you know?
Your name is Tigran.
Ahh...
You would just go and buy these candies just for the people who ride in your car?
Of course.
I just go to the Costco.
That is so incredibly nice of you that you go all the way to the Costco to buy us these candies.
And I am so sorry about the Armenian genocide.
Thank you, Tigran.
Listen, I hope you will give me five stars, eh?
You got it!
Five stars, all the way.
Be careful.
Hi, daddy.
You want to come visit me?
Yes, now is the perfect time.
I would love that!
Hey, dad.
I'm here to help you pack up.
Okay.
I think I'm gonna come out to Joshy next.
Okay.
Do you want me to be with you?
No, I'll do...
I'll do it alone.
Alright, well, I'll just have him come over here, then.
- Do you think he's ready?
- No, you never are.
It's like having a baby.
You know, just one day the baby shows up and you figure it out.
- Honey?
- What?
Are you okay with me?
Oh, God, yes.
- No, I'm happy.
- Yeah?
Yeah, it's... it's...
It's inspiring.
I mean, I'm so glad you get to be who you are.
That's what we should all be.
Not my business, but how long have you and Tammy been carrying on?
Not my business.
I can't stop thinking about her.
I... it's like... it's just, like, we just reconnected, after all this time, and it just happened.
Now we're just, like, connecting every second.
I cannot stop texting her.
You know, it's like, "What are you doing? "
"Eating a sandwich."
"How is it?" "It's amazing."
You know... the thing that you do when you're falling in love?
Not really.
So you're not in love with Len?
No.
I mean, whatever.
I mean, I...
I...
I'm...
I'm staying with Len.
I'm gonna stay with Len.
I'm happy to stay with Len.
I just... you know, I just wonder, you know, what would it feel like to be loved by someone who's actually moved by loving you?
Why don't you tell him what you want?
I don't want to have to tell someone.
That is... that is the whole...
You can't tell someone that.
Mm.
Which one of you are gonna take the encyclopedias?
None of us, dad.
Nobody in the world wants those.
These are the bicentennial encyclopedias.
Ugh.
Would it be okay with you if I just crashed here tonight?
Of course, sweetie.
But I wanted you to know that I was thinking about you, and...
I really loved your message earlier, so...
Please leave me more, 'cause when I hear your voice,
I feel better.
Okay, guess I'll go.
I'm sorry I keep calling you.
Hey, Kaya.
Don't know why you're not calling me back, and I'm sick of getting your voicemail, so, anyhoo, maybe you might want to think about answering your phone and saying hello?
* I don't want to be seen, I don't want to be heard *
* Ooh ooh ooh-ooh *
What's your ish?
* What do you want, Josh?
*
Come here.
Let's go.
* I'm in the middle of rehearsal *
Come on.
Fine.

So who would like a Charleston Chew?

- Fuck that shit!
- Back... back... back... back.
You just got fired, bro!
Hi.
Hey.
I got a... an hour, a whole hour, just for you.
I cancelled the Grubman thing.
I just made up some bullshit.
So do you want to tell me what's going on?
I don't know...
I'm just...
I...
It's, like, riddled with anxiety, lately.
It's like...
It's kind of like...
Anxious exhaustion.
I heard this guy call it that on the radio just, like...
I'm overwhelmed all the time.
You're overwhelmed all the time?
H-how?
How are you overwhelmed?
'Cause we have Sylvia full-time.
I don't know if you're actually aware, but, um, I manage Sylvia, and, uh, and I'm on, like, four committees at Ivanhoe, and the parent outreach at the " J"...
I'm actually training for a triathlon.
I have to swim in the ocean to raise money for breast cancer, because I hope one day if I have breast cancer, somebody swims for me.
Babe...
Are you okay?
Like... do you feel okay?
Oh, my God.
I don't want you to be mad at me.
I'm not mad.
Ugh!
Okay, you know that co-op in college that I worked at?
I didn't tell you that I also lived there.
- I think you told me that.
- I did?
Okay, well, but I didn't tell you that I...
that... that I lived there... with... with Tammy.
Ohh...
Like, in my... in my... in my room with her.
In my bed, actually.
I was in love with her, Len.
I... am in love with her.
Well, I'm gonna call Dr. Schomberg,
- 'cause we haven't...
- No.
talked to anyone in a long time.
- Len, no.
- Yeah, I'm calling her right now.
No.
This doesn't... this has nothing to do with...
This isn't us.
This is me.
Len...
- We're gonna talk to her.
- It's me.
I'll get us an appointment, and we can talk to her.
Len, it's me.
It's me.
You're not allowed to do this, you know.
I don't know how not to.
I just came from Barry's.
I'm gonna have to call you back, okay, dad?
What is going on?
Tell me you did not tell him to fire me.
Yeah, I told him to fire you.
I mean, my God, what was I supposed to do?
I mean, you wouldn't drop the whole baby thing.
Yeah!
It's a big deal.
I don't know if you can appreciate this, but this is a fucking big deal for me.
I've been fucking shit up my whole life.
I'm trying to do the right thing.
By right thing you mean we live in the mountains, and I run around with milk spewing out of my boobs?
Okay, that was a stupid idea.
Because you care about me so much, Josh?
It was a stupid idea.
I'm sorry.
Josh, this is only the second time you've even been to my house, okay?
And it's not like I live in Venice.
Echo Park and Silver Lake are...
I don't even know where one stops and the other starts.
Okay, rampart.
Look...
You never asked me to come here.
I would come here if you asked me to.
A normal guy just comes.
Okay.
I'm here now.
I'm here now, and I will continue to come.
Um, I'm going in, and you're not invited.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Okay...
- Don't...
Kaya, how'd this happen?
Okay, look, we have a baby in there, and I don't think you realize how important that is.
I already had the abortion.
When?
Yesterday.
Took, like, four Tylenol.
I was totally fine.
I couldn't do it.
I just chickened out with Josh.
I'm really sorry about that.
- Boys are the hardest.
- Boys are the hardest.
- They are.
- Why?
Well, because they...
They never stop really seeing you as their father, and girls are just easier that way.
I think they're more sensitive.
Why don't we go out, huh?
Where?
Well, you know, we'll find some place in Weho, and we'll just go drink.
I have to come out to Ali.
Nothing feels right until I do that.
Mike, I need three glasses of water, please.
Shit's about to get weird.
Okay, if I get too crazy, you guys have to be my guides.
Really?
You think you can handle the two of us?
Oh, please.
You know I've been working out.
Ooh, we got a live one.
For you.
Bottoms up, freaks.
Ah.
Um, guys, that was actually just cyanide that we took.
I'm just kidding!
Hey, you've reached Tammy Cashman.
You know what to do, so do it.
Babe, I did it.
I left Len.
Oh, my God.
You know what?
I actually...
I think it's gonna be okay.
I think he's gonna be okay.
I just have to... tell the kids.
I'm...
I'm taking them to my dad's tomorrow.
Should I tell them tomorrow?
Oh, God, I don't know.
Where are you, honey?
I need to talk to you.
Will you call me, please?
Mm, I feel like I'm spooning a bear.
Ugh, this is how the cave women felt.
You know what you look like?
A cat.
Like a feral cat.
I had a cat when I was a kid.
We used to be kids.
Derek, Derek.
You're too far away from us.
- Why are you so far away?
- I don't know, I just...
I'm so fucking thirsty.
You should kiss me.
I'm 70% water.
Hi, Mike.
You're making me naked.
Mike's making me naked.
Ooh, is that my pussy?
- Yeah, that's your pussy.
- Where're you going?
I'm gonna give Mike your pussy so then Mike has Derek's pussy, 'cause I'm the vessel for you guys...
- What?
- So that you have to be in this room, fucking each other...
What?
- Because that's...
- No.
What you really want to be doing.
- No.
No.
- You really wanna be
- loving each other.
- What?
That'll do it.
This is your bitch.
- Is this the wrong one?
- Ohh...
But why do I have to leave?
Hello.
I hope Mike's okay.
Is Mike okay?
Bye.
Hi.
Hello.
I love your car.
It's so pretty.
I think this is what it must feel like to be in the womb, but you probably can't do this with your arms.
You have such a pretty face.
Ha.
Where do you come from?
I come from Armenia.
Oh, is your whole family there?
- Yes.
- Are you sad about that?
Being alive is being sad.
Can I have a candy bar?
Yes, of course.
They're for customer, like you.
My business card is back there, too.
Maybe I can take you to the airport or something sometime, you know?
Your name is Tigran.
Ahh...
You would just go and buy these candies just for the people who ride in your car?
Of course.
I just go to the Costco.
That is so incredibly nice of you that you go all the way to the Costco to buy us these candies.
And I am so sorry about the Armenian genocide.

Hi, daddy.
You want to come visit me?
Yes, now is the perfect time.
I would love that!
Hey, dad.
I'm here to help you pack up.
Okay.
I think I'm gonna come out to Joshy next.
Okay.
Do you want me to be with you?
No, I'll do...
I'll do it alone.
Alright, well, I'll just have him come over here, then.
- Do you think he's ready?
- No, you never are.
It's like having a baby.
You know, just one day the baby shows up and you figure it out.
- Honey?
- What?
Are you okay with me?
Oh, God, yes.
- No, I'm happy.
- Yeah?
Yeah, it's... it's...
It's inspiring.
I mean, I'm so glad you get to be who you are.
That's what we should all be.
Not my business, but how long have you and Tammy been carrying on?
Not my business.
I can't stop thinking about her.
I... it's like... it's just, like, we just reconnected, after all this time, and it just happened.
Now we're just, like, connecting every second.
I cannot stop texting her.
You know, it's like, "What are you doing? "
"Eating a sandwich."
"How is it?" "It's amazing."
You know... the thing that you do when you're falling in love?
Not really.
[Ahem]
So you're not in love with Len?
No.
I mean, whatever.
I mean, I...
I...
I'm...
I'm staying with Len.
I'm gonna stay with Len.
I'm happy to stay with Len.
I just... you know, I just wonder, you know, what would it feel like to be loved by someone who's actually moved by loving you?
Why don't you tell him what you want?
I don't want to have to tell someone.
That is... that is the whole...
You can't tell someone that.
Mm.
Which one of you are gonna take the encyclopedias?
None of us, dad.
Nobody in the world wants those.
These are the bicentennial encyclopedias.
Ugh.
Would it be okay with you if I just crashed here tonight?
Of course, sweetie.
[Gentle piano music]
But I wanted you to know that I was thinking about you, and...
I really loved your message earlier, so...
Please leave me more, 'cause when I hear your voice,
I feel better.
Okay, guess I'll go. [Laughs]
I'm sorry I keep calling you.
[Giggles]
[Exhales]
Hey, Kaya.
Don't know why you're not calling me back, and I'm sick of getting your voicemail, so, anyhoo, maybe you might want to think about answering your phone and saying hello?

What's up?
Where the fuck is Kaya?
She's not answering my calls.
- She's not answering my texts.
- I don't know, dude.
- Is she avoiding me?
- I couldn't tell you.
Did she not tell you that we might be getting married?
- Married?
- Yeah.
- I love her.
I proposed, okay?
- Oh, my God.
You weird, old, sad fellow.
Married?
Are you living in a fucking dream world?
Are you such a fetus that you've not been in love before?
- Yeah, like a million times.
- Thank you.
Why don't you help me out and make her call me back and make sure she's here for the meeting with Ryan.
[Phone ringing]
- What do you want?
- You got to get over here, asap, 'cause dad's got me packing up all his crap to donate to Haddasah League, and it's now or never.
Um, no, I can't do that today.
What about the cereal boxes?
Do not think about touching those or opening those.
Yeah, it's too late, actually, for that, 'cause I already did.
Nice photos and letters of you and creepy Rita.
I almost forgot about you and the babysitter.
Okay.
A... okay, you know what?
Um, I'm coming. [Phone beeps]
Those the moon rocks?
You got 'em?
- Yeah.
- Can I see 'em?
Yes.
Okay, there they are.
- So it's just like "E, " Really?
- Yeah.
But you know how with "E" You, like, you have to take Xanax when you're coming down, otherwise your brain hurts?
What?
No, nobody's ever told me that.
Great, I've been taking my ecstasy wrong for years.
Okay, so what's the plan?
I got Saturday and Sunday off.
Do you want to go Joshua tree, which I realized I haven't been to since I was a kid?
I'm so sorry.
I feel like a jerk.
I had a plan that was, like, a sex thing.
And I didn't tell you that, that that was what I wanted to do with the guy from the park?
What guy from the park?
The trainer from the park.
You're hanging out with that guy?
Yeah, I went back, and like, we trained, and then we started fucking, and whatever.
And then I met his roommate, who is crazy sexy, and I'm planning a little spit-roasting epic... night.
What is spit-roasting?
That sounds disgusting.
Do you really not know what spit-roasting is?
Um, I know it in relation to food.
- God, don't you watch porn?
- I don't know.
I find it kind of disturbing, don't you?
Sorry.
Hold on.
Okay, so imagine that this is me.
I am the candle, the white-hot, burning candle, and this pepper shaker is one guy, and this... imagine this was a pepper shaker, too.
This is the other guy.
- Okay, so his roommate's black.
- Oh, yeah.
That's very classic Ali.
This pepper shaker's investigating my vagina from the behind, and this pepper shaker is investigating my mouth, and I... am roasting.
You're gross.
I know.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Joshy's on his way.
- Oh, good.
What is this?
What's all this?
Oh, this is all I'm taking.
- This is it?
- Yeah.
I mean,
I just got up in the middle of the night, and I went, "You know, it's just stuff, right?"
all I need is a safe place to rest my keppie.
[Car horn honking]
Oh, it's Joshy.
No, no.
That's...
That's the moving truck.
He'll be here soon.
Are you... are you sure you're okay?
Coming out is coming out is coming out.
I'm good.
Okay.

Um, it's not the mill, dad.
Oh, okay.
Do you want to help me carry some of this stuff to the car?
- These?
- Yeah.

Why didn't you tell me?
What... what?
You smell like the perfume aisle at a sav-on in the Philippines.
You've got a girlfriend.
Who is she?
[Laughs]
Who... you're moving in with her?
It's... eh... it's complicated.
Yeah, I'll bet it's complicated.
You want this in your car?
Yeah, and if I can tell from the scent, she's about 30 years younger than you and a bit of a freak.
- Am I right?
- She's not a freak.
That's last month's issue.
You know, you... you could get a... a post office box.
Uh, my wife does the bills.

It's totally your wheelhouse, by the way, brother.
Um, I'm in the middle of setting up a tour right now.
So, I highly doubt I'm gonna have the time, you know?
So actually, um, I'm gonna have Glenda wrangle Glitterish for a minute, just a little moving and shaking real quick, and I'm gonna have you jump in with these guys, and, um, we'll talk about the details later, okay?
I think we're gonna talk about it right fucking now.
Is... is this about Kaya?
[Barry chuckles]
What did she say to you?
Because if she told you to fire me,
- Uh-huh.
- I got a right to know.
- Do you know what I'm talking about?
- Sit down.
Everything's actually totally chill.
Barry, what did she say?
Why don't you take a look at those bagels,

- Hey, Barry.
- That fruit salad real fast.
- Sit the fuck down.
We're not having this talk right now.
- What did she say to you?
- She said she didn't feel fucking safe... can we talk about it fucking later?
- She doesn't feel safe with me?
- Can we talk about this

- What does that even mean?
I'm the one that discovered Glitterish.
I'm the one that was there the night they played the roxy the first time, and you were the one who didn't want to sign them.

Of course.
I just go to the Costco.
That is so incredibly nice of you that you go all the way to the Costco to buy us these candies.
And I am so sorry about the Armenian genocide.

Hi, daddy.
You want to come visit me?
Yes, now is the perfect time.
I would love that!
Hey, dad.
I'm here to help you pack up.
Okay.
I think I'm gonna come out to Joshy next.
Okay.
Do you want me to be with you?
No, I'll do...
I'll do it alone.
Alright, well, I'll just have him come over here, then.
- Do you think he's ready?
- No, you never are.
It's like having a baby.
You know, just one day the baby shows up and you figure it out.
- Honey?
- What?
Are you okay with me?
Oh, God, yes.
- No, I'm happy.
- Yeah?
Yeah, it's... it's...
It's inspiring.
I mean, I'm so glad you get to be who you are.
That's what we should all be.
Not my business, but how long have you and Tammy been carrying on?
Not my business.
I can't stop thinking about her.
I... it's like... it's just, like, we just reconnected, after all this time, and it just happened.
Now we're just, like, connecting every second.
I cannot stop texting her.
You know, it's like, "What are you doing? "
"Eating a sandwich."
"How is it?" "It's amazing."
You know... the thing that you do when you're falling in love?
Not really.
[Ahem]
So you're not in love with Len?
No.
I mean, whatever.
I mean, I...
I...
I'm...
I'm staying with Len.
I'm gonna stay with Len.
I'm happy to stay with Len.
I just... you know, I just wonder, you know, what would it feel like to be loved by someone who's actually moved by loving you?
Why don't you tell him what you want?
I don't want to have to tell someone.
That is... that is the whole...
You can't tell someone that.
Mm.
Which one of you are gonna take the encyclopedias?
None of us, dad.
Nobody in the world wants those.
These are the bicentennial encyclopedias.
Ugh.
Would it be okay with you if I just crashed here tonight?
Of course, sweetie.
[Gentle piano music]
But I wanted you to know that I was thinking about you, and...
I really loved your message earlier, so...
Please leave me more, 'cause when I hear your voice,
I feel better.
Okay, guess I'll go. [Laughs]
I'm sorry I keep calling you.
[Giggles]
[Exhales]
Hey, Kaya.
Don't know why you're not calling me back, and I'm sick of getting your voicemail, so, anyhoo, maybe you might want to think about answering your phone and saying hello?

One second, you guys.
What's up?
Where the fuck is Kaya?
She's not answering my calls.
- She's not answering my texts.
- I don't know, dude.
- Is she avoiding me?
- I couldn't tell you.
Did she not tell you that we might be getting married?
- Married?
- Yeah.
- I love her.
I proposed, okay?
- Oh, my God.
You weird, old, sad fellow.
Married?
Are you living in a fucking dream world?
Are you such a fetus that you've not been in love before?
- Yeah, like a million times.
- Thank you.
Why don't you help me out and make her call me back and make sure she's here for the meeting with Ryan.
[Phone ringing]
- What do you want?
- You got to get over here, asap, 'cause dad's got me packing up all his crap to donate to Haddasah League, and it's now or never.
Um, no, I can't do that today.
What about the cereal boxes?
Do not think about touching those or opening those.
Yeah, it's too late, actually, for that, 'cause I already did.
Nice photos and letters of you and creepy Rita.
I almost forgot about you and the babysitter.
Okay.
A... okay, you know what?
Um, I'm coming. [Phone beeps]
Those the moon rocks?
You got 'em?
- Yeah.
- Can I see 'em?
Yes.
Okay, there they are.
- So it's just like "E, " really?
- Yeah.
But you know how with "E", you, like, you have to take Xanax when you're coming down, otherwise your brain hurts?
What?
No, nobody's ever told me that.
Great, I've been taking my ecstasy wrong for years.
Okay, so what's the plan?
I got Saturday and Sunday off.
Do you want to go Joshua Tree, which I realized I haven't been to since I was a kid?
I'm so sorry.
I feel like a jerk.
I had a plan that was, like, a sex thing.
And I didn't tell you that, that that was what I wanted to do with the guy from the park?
What guy from the park?
The trainer from the park.
You're hanging out with that guy?
Yeah, I went back, and like, we trained, and then we started fucking, and whatever.
And then I met his roommate, who is crazy sexy, and I'm planning a little spit-roasting epic... night.
What is spit-roasting?
That sounds disgusting.
Do you really not know what spit-roasting is?
Um, I know it in relation to food.
- God, don't you watch porn?
- I don't know.
I find it kind of disturbing, don't you?
Sorry.
Hold on.
Okay, so imagine that this is me.
I am the candle, the white-hot, burning candle, and this pepper shaker is one guy, and this... imagine this was a pepper shaker, too.
This is the other guy.
- Okay, so his roommate's black.
- Oh, yeah.
That's very classic Ali.
This pepper shaker's investigating my vagina from the behind, and this pepper shaker is investigating my mouth, and I... am roasting.
You're gross.
I know.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Joshy's on his way.
- Oh, good.
What is this?
What's all this?
Oh, this is all I'm taking.
- This is it?
- Yeah.
I mean,
I just got up in the middle of the night, and I went, "You know, it's just stuff, right?"
all I need is a safe place to rest my keppie.
[Car horn honking]
Oh, it's Joshy.
No, no.
That's...
That's the moving truck.
He'll be here soon.
Are you... are you sure you're okay?
Coming out is coming out is coming out.
I'm good.
Okay.
Love you.
[Breathes deeply]
Hey, dad, I'm here.
[Metronome ticking]
Dad?
[Ticking faster]
- Dad!
- Yeah.
- Hey.
- Hey, thanks for coming.
Sarah told me.
Oh...[Exhales]
Listen, uh, can I get you some, uh, I don't know, tea?
I have, uh, soda.
I have water, I...
I know that.
I'm not...
I'm not making you late for work, am I?
Um, it's not the mill, dad.
Oh, okay.
Do you want to help me carry some of this stuff to the car?
- These?
- Yeah.
[Sniffs]
Why didn't you tell me?
What... what?
You smell like the perfume aisle at a sav-on in the Philippines.
You've got a girlfriend.
Who is she?
[Laughs]
Who... you're moving in with her?
It's... eh... it's complicated.
Yeah, I'll bet it's complicated.
You want this in your car?
Yeah, and if I can tell from the scent, she's about 30 years younger than you and a bit of a freak.
- Am I right?
- She's not a freak.
That's last month's issue.
You know, you... you could get a... a post office box.
Uh, my wife does the bills.
- Mine too.
- [Chuckles]
Look at me.
I'm...
I'm full of bad advice.
You know what you can do?
You can just stick it in an issue of deck and patio or... [Chuckles]

No, you have too many cavities.

Yeah, that looks like crack.
No, my friend gave them to me.
She had some extra.
They're amazing.
They're supposed to be better than "E," 'cause they're, like, pure MDMA.
[Sports announcer on TV]
Yeah, this shit sits in your spine.
No, no, no, no, no.
That stuff is pure, and... and there's, like, a really easy comedown.
The government even gives it to Iraq vets who are recovering from PTSD.
It's like...
We should definitely do what the government does.
Uncle Sam wants you to roll with Ali.

Hey, Mike!

Barry's looking for ya.
He's in the conference room.
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.
[Low conversation]
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You got a sec?
- Um, I'm kind of in a hurry.
- Ryan's here.
- Oh.
We're gonna talk through the remaster with Kaya and Margaux.
Yeah, yeah.
No, this'll just be a minute.
Pop a squat, 'cause I want you to meet, uh, the Drug Mules.
- What's up?
- Hey, what's up?
Uh, I reached out to you about them a while ago.
I caught them at south-by, and I just went ape balls.
It's totally your wheelhouse, by the way, brother.
Um, I'm in the middle of setting up a tour right now.
So, I highly doubt I'm gonna have the time, you know?
So actually, um, I'm gonna have Glenda wrangle Glitterish for a minute, just a little moving and shaking real quick, and I'm gonna have you jump in with these guys, and, um, we'll talk about the details later, okay?
I think we're gonna talk about it right fucking now.
Is... is this about Kaya?
[Barry chuckles]
What did she say to you?
Because if she told you to fire me,
- Uh-huh.
- I got a right to know.
- Do you know what I'm talking about?
- Sit down.
Everything's actually totally chill.
Barry, what did she say?
Why don't you take a look at those bagels,
- and you need to get to know...
- Hey, Barry.
- That fruit salad real fast.
- Sit the fuck down.
We're not having this talk right now.
- What did she say to you?
- She said she didn't feel fucking safe... can we talk about it fucking later?
- She doesn't feel safe with me?
- Can we talk about this
- fucking later, bro?
- What does that even mean?
I'm the one that discovered Glitterish.
I'm the one that was there the night they played the roxy the first time, and you were the one who didn't want to sign them.
- I protected her from you...
- Dude.
And now you're gonna fucking fire me from the...
- Fuck that shit!
- Back... back... back... back.
You just got fired, bro!
Hi.
Hey.
I got a... an hour, a whole hour, just for you.
I cancelled the Grubman thing.
I just made up some bullshit.
So do you want to tell me what's going on?
I don't know...
I'm just...
I...
It's, like, riddled with anxiety, lately.
It's like...
It's kind of like...
Anxious exhaustion.
I heard this guy call it that on the radio just, like...
I'm overwhelmed all the time.
You're overwhelmed all the time?
H-how?
[Chuckles]
How are you overwhelmed?
'Cause we have Sylvia full-time.
I don't know if you're actually aware, but, um, I manage Sylvia, and, uh, and I'm on, like, four committees at Ivanhoe, and the parent outreach at the " J"...
I'm actually training for a triathlon.
I have to swim in the ocean to raise money for breast cancer, because I hope one day if I have breast cancer, somebody swims for me.
Babe...
Are you okay?
Like... do you feel okay?
[Whining] Oh, my God.
I don't want you to be mad at me.
I'm not mad.
Ugh!
Okay, you know that co-op in college that I worked at?
I didn't tell you that I also lived there.
- I think you told me that.
- I did?
Okay, well, but I didn't tell you that I...
that... that I lived there... with... with Tammy.
[Groaning] Ohh...
Like, in my... in my... in my room with her.
In my bed, actually.
I was in love with her, Len.
I... am in love with her.
Well, I'm gonna call Dr. Schomberg,
- 'cause we haven't...
- No.
talked to anyone in a long time.
- Len, no.
- Yeah, I'm calling her right now.
No.
This doesn't... this has nothing to do with...
This isn't us.
This is me.
Len...
- We're gonna talk to her.
- It's me.
I'll get us an appointment, and we can talk to her.
Len, it's me.
It's me.
You're not allowed to do this, you know.
I don't know how not to.
I just came from Barry's.
I'm gonna have to call you back, okay, dad?
What is going on?
Tell me you did not tell him to fire me.
Yeah, I told him to fire you.
I mean, my God, what was I supposed to do?
I mean, you wouldn't drop the whole baby thing.
Yeah!
It's a big deal.
I don't know if you can appreciate this, but this is a fucking big deal for me.
I've been fucking shit up my whole life.
I'm trying to do the right thing.
By right thing you mean we live in the mountains, and I run around with milk spewing out of my boobs?
Okay, that was a stupid idea.
Because you care about me so much, Josh?
It was a stupid idea.
I'm sorry.
Josh, this is only the second time you've even been to my house, okay?
And it's not like I live in Venice.
Echo Park and Silver Lake are...
I don't even know where one stops and the other starts.
Okay, rampart.
Look...
You never asked me to come here.
I would come here if you asked me to.
A normal guy just comes.
Okay.
I'm here now.
I'm here now, and I will continue to come.
Um, I'm going in, and you're not invited.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Okay...
- [Murmurs] Don't...
Kaya, how'd this happen?
Okay, look, we have a baby in there, and I don't think you realize how important that is.
I already had the abortion. [Laughs]
When?
Yesterday.
Took, like, four Tylenol.
I was totally fine.
I couldn't do it.
I just chickened out with Josh.
I'm really sorry about that.
- Boys are the hardest.
- Boys are the hardest.
- They are.
- Why?
Well, because they... [Sighs]
They never stop really seeing you as their father, and girls are just easier that way.
I think they're more sensitive.
Why don't we go out, huh?
Where?
Well, you know, we'll find some place in Weho, and we'll just go drink.
I have to come out to Ali.
Nothing feels right until I do that.
[Exhales]
[Sighs]
Mike, I need three glasses of water, please.
Shit's about to get weird.
Okay, if I get too crazy, you guys have to be my guides.
Really?
You think you can handle the two of us?
Oh, please.
You know I've been working out.
Ooh, we got a live one.
For you.

We used to be kids.

You're too far away from us.
- Why are you so far away?
- I don't know, I just...
I'm so fucking thirsty.

Hi, Mike.
You're making me naked.
Mike's making me naked.
Ooh, is that my pussy?
- Yeah, that's your pussy.
- Where're you going?
I'm gonna give Mike your pussy so then Mike has Derek's pussy, 'cause I'm the vessel for you guys...

What?

What you really want to be doing.

No.

That'll do it.
This is your bitch.

Hello.
I hope Mike's okay.
Is Mike okay?
Bye.
Hi.
Hello.
I love your car.
It's so pretty.
I think this is what it must feel like to be in the womb, but you probably can't do this with your arms.
You have such a pretty face.
Ha.
Where do you come from?
I come from Armenia.
Oh, is your whole family there?
- Yes.
- Are you sad about that?
Being alive is being sad.
[Gasps] Can I have a candy bar?
Yes, of course.
They're for customer, like you.
My business card is back there, too.
Maybe I can take you to the airport or something sometime, you know?
Your name is Tigran.
Ahh...
You would just go and buy these candies just for the people who ride in your car?
Of course.
I just go to the Costco.
That is so incredibly nice of you that you go all the way to the Costco to buy us these candies.

And then I met his roommate, who is crazy sexy, and I'm planning a little spit-roasting epic... night.
What is spit-roasting?
That sounds disgusting.
Do you really not know what spit-roasting is?
Um, I know it in relation to food.
- God, don't you watch porn?
- I don't know.
I find it kind of disturbing, don't you?
Sorry.
Hold on.
Okay, so imagine that this is me.
I am the candle, the white-hot, burning candle, and this pepper shaker is one guy, and this... imagine this was a pepper shaker, too.
This is the other guy.
- Okay, so his roommate's black.
- Oh, yeah.
That's very classic Ali.
This pepper shaker's investigating my vagina from the behind, and this pepper shaker is investigating my mouth, and I... am roasting.
You're gross.
I know.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Joshy's on his way.
- Oh, good.
What is this?
What's all this?
Oh, this is all I'm taking.
- This is it?
- Yeah.
I mean,
I just got up in the middle of the night, and I went, "You know, it's just stuff, right?"
all I need is a safe place to rest my keppie.
[Car horn honking]
Oh, it's Joshy.
No, no.
That's...
That's the moving truck.
He'll be here soon.
Are you... are you sure you're okay?
Coming out is coming out is coming out.
I'm good.
Okay.
Love you.
[Breathes deeply]
Hey, dad, I'm here.
[Metronome ticking]
Dad?
[Ticking faster]
- Dad!
- Yeah.
- Hey.
- Hey, thanks for coming.
Sarah told me.
Oh...[Exhales]
Listen, uh, can I get you some, uh, I don't know, tea?
I have, uh, soda.
I have water, I...
I know that.
I'm not...
I'm not making you late for work, am I?
Um, it's not the mill, dad.
Oh, okay.
Do you want to help me carry some of this stuff to the car?
- These?
- Yeah.
[Sniffs]
Why didn't you tell me?
What... what?
You smell like the perfume aisle at a sav-on in the Philippines.
You've got a girlfriend.
Who is she?
[Laughs]
Who... you're moving in with her?
It's... eh... it's complicated.
Yeah, I'll bet it's complicated.
You want this in your car?
Yeah, and if I can tell from the scent, she's about 30 years younger than you and a bit of a freak.
- Am I right?
- She's not a freak.
That's last month's issue.
You know, you... you could get a... a post office box.
Uh, my wife does the bills.
- Mine too.
- [Chuckles]
Look at me.
I'm...
I'm full of bad advice.
You know what you can do?
You can just stick it in an issue of deck and patio or... [Chuckles]
Outdoor living magazine.
- I'm Mark.
- Mort.
* Inside you, the time moves *
* And she don't fade *
* The ghost in you, she don't fade *
- Did you get it?
- Okay.
So who would like a Charleston Chew?
- Ooh, me, please.
- All right.
Who wants a Abba-Zaba?
- I'll take that.
- You want that?
I want the Charleston Chew.
No, you have too many cavities.
Trade you my Abba-Zaba.
- I don't like peanut butter.
- No!
- Give it to me.
- No, stop!
- Hey, hey.
- Give it!
- No, stop it!
- Hey, hey, hey!
I don't want to hear a peep out of you.
[Engine starts]
Both: * Peep *
Looky, looky, look.
These are the moon rocks.
Yeah, that looks like crack.
No, my friend gave them to me.
She had some extra.
They're amazing.
They're supposed to be better than "E," 'cause they're, like, pure MDMA.
[Sports announcer on TV]
Yeah, this shit sits in your spine.
No, no, no, no, no.
That stuff is pure, and... and there's, like, a really easy comedown.
The government even gives it to Iraq vets who are recovering from PTSD.
It's like...
We should definitely do what the government does.
Uncle Sam wants you to roll with Ali.
- That's cute.
- Could be fun.
[Whispers] Should we ask Mike?
Nm-mm.
Hey, Mike!
Wanna get high with us?
What you got?
[Background chatter, TV chatter]
What's up?
- Hey, Josh.
- Hey.
Barry's looking for ya.
He's in the conference room.
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.
[Low conversation]
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You got a sec?
- Um, I'm kind of in a hurry.
- Ryan's here.
- Oh.
We're gonna talk through the remaster with Kaya and Margaux.
Yeah, yeah.
No, this'll just be a minute.
Pop a squat, 'cause I want you to meet, uh, the Drug Mules.
- What's up?
- Hey, what's up?
Uh, I reached out to you about them a while ago.
I caught them at south-by, and I just went ape balls.
It's totally your wheelhouse, by the way, brother.
Um, I'm in the middle of setting up a tour right now.
So, I highly doubt I'm gonna have the time, you know?
So actually, um, I'm gonna have Glenda wrangle Glitterish for a minute, just a little moving and shaking real quick, and I'm gonna have you jump in with these guys, and, um, we'll talk about the details later, okay?
I think we're gonna talk about it right fucking now.
Is... is this about Kaya?
[Barry chuckles]
What did she say to you?
Because if she told you to fire me,
- Uh-huh.
- I got a right to know.
- Do you know what I'm talking about?
- Sit down.
Everything's actually totally chill.
Barry, what did she say?
Why don't you take a look at those bagels,
- and you need to get to know...
- Hey, Barry.
- That fruit salad real fast.
- Sit the fuck down.
We're not having this talk right now.
- What did she say to you?
- She said she didn't feel fucking safe... can we talk about it fucking later?
- She doesn't feel safe with me?
- Can we talk about this
- fucking later, bro?
- What does that even mean?
I'm the one that discovered Glitterish.
I'm the one that was there the night they played the roxy the first time, and you were the one who didn't want to sign them.
- I protected her from you...
- Dude.
And now you're gonna fucking fire me from the...
- Fuck that shit!
- Back... back... back... back.
You just got fired, bro!
Hi.
Hey.
I got a... an hour, a whole hour, just for you.
I cancelled the Grubman thing.
I just made up some bullshit.
So do you want to tell me what's going on?
I don't know...
I'm just...
I...
It's, like, riddled with anxiety, lately.
It's like...
It's kind of like...
Anxious exhaustion.
I heard this guy call it that on the radio just, like...
I'm overwhelmed all the time.
You're overwhelmed all the time?
H-how?
[Chuckles]
How are you overwhelmed?
'Cause we have Sylvia full-time.
I don't know if you're actually aware, but, um, I manage Sylvia, and, uh, and I'm on, like, four committees at Ivanhoe, and the parent outreach at the " J"...
I'm actually training for a triathlon.
I have to swim in the ocean to raise money for breast cancer, because I hope one day if I have breast cancer, somebody swims for me.
Babe...
Are you okay?
Like... do you feel okay?
[Whining] Oh, my God.
I don't want you to be mad at me.
I'm not mad.
Ugh!
Okay, you know that co-op in college that I worked at?
I didn't tell you that I also lived there.
- I think you told me that.
- I did?
Okay, well, but I didn't tell you that I...
that... that I lived there... with... with Tammy.
[Groaning] Ohh...
Like, in my... in my... in my room with her.
In my bed, actually.
I was in love with her, Len.
I... am in love with her.
Well, I'm gonna call Dr. Schomberg,
- 'cause we haven't...
- No.
talked to anyone in a long time.
- Len, no.
- Yeah, I'm calling her right now.
No.
This doesn't... this has nothing to do with...
This isn't us.
This is me.
Len...
- We're gonna talk to her.
- It's me.
I'll get us an appointment, and we can talk to her.
Len, it's me.
It's me.
You're not allowed to do this, you know.
I don't know how not to.
I just came from Barry's.
I'm gonna have to call you back, okay, dad?
What is going on?
Tell me you did not tell him to fire me.
Yeah, I told him to fire you.
I mean, my God, what was I supposed to do?
I mean, you wouldn't drop the whole baby thing.
Yeah!
It's a big deal.
I don't know if you can appreciate this, but this is a fucking big deal for me.
I've been fucking shit up my whole life.
I'm trying to do the right thing.
By right thing you mean we live in the mountains, and I run around with milk spewing out of my boobs?
Okay, that was a stupid idea.
Because you care about me so much, Josh?
It was a stupid idea.
I'm sorry.
Josh, this is only the second time you've even been to my house, okay?
And it's not like I live in Venice.
Echo Park and Silver Lake are...
I don't even know where one stops and the other starts.
Okay, rampart.
Look...
You never asked me to come here.
I would come here if you asked me to.
A normal guy just comes.
Okay.
I'm here now.
I'm here now, and I will continue to come.
Um, I'm going in, and you're not invited.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Okay...
- [Murmurs] Don't...
Kaya, how'd this happen?
Okay, look, we have a baby in there, and I don't think you realize how important that is.
I already had the abortion. [Laughs]
When?
Yesterday.
Took, like, four Tylenol.
I was totally fine.
I couldn't do it.
I just chickened out with Josh.
I'm really sorry about that.
- Boys are the hardest.
- Boys are the hardest.
- They are.
- Why?
Well, because they... [Sighs]
They never stop really seeing you as their father, and girls are just easier that way.
I think they're more sensitive.
Why don't we go out, huh?
Where?
Well, you know, we'll find some place in Weho, and we'll just go drink.
I have to come out to Ali.
Nothing feels right until I do that.
[Exhales]
[Sighs]
Mike, I need three glasses of water, please.
Shit's about to get weird.
Okay, if I get too crazy, you guys have to be my guides.
Really?
You think you can handle the two of us?
Oh, please.
You know I've been working out.
Ooh, we got a live one.
For you.
[Mellow rock plays in background]
*
Bottoms up, freaks.
Ah.
Um, guys, that was actually just cyanide that we took.
I'm just kidding!
[Pounds table]
Hey, you've reached Tammy Cashman.
You know what to do, so do it.
[Beep]
Babe, I did it.
I left Len.
Oh, my God.
You know what?
I actually...
I think it's gonna be okay.
I think he's gonna be okay.
I just have to... tell the kids.
I'm...
I'm taking them to my dad's tomorrow.
Should I tell them tomorrow?
Oh, God, I don't know.
[Beep] Where are you, honey?
I need to talk to you.
Will you call me, please?
[Sighs]
Mm, I feel like I'm spooning a bear.
Ugh, this is how the cave women felt.
You know what you look like?
A cat.
Like a feral cat. [Laughs]
I had a cat when I was a kid.
We used to be kids.
[Whispering] Derek, Derek.
You're too far away from us.
- Why are you so far away?
- I don't know, I just...
I'm so fucking thirsty.
[Gasps] You should kiss me.
I'm 70% water.
Hi, Mike.
You're making me naked.
Mike's making me naked.
Ooh, is that my pussy?
- Yeah, that's your pussy.
- Where're you going?
I'm gonna give Mike your pussy so then Mike has Derek's pussy, 'cause I'm the vessel for you guys...
- What?
- So that you have to be in this room, fucking each other...
What?
- Because that's...
- No.
What you really want to be doing.
- No.
No.
- You really wanna be
- loving each other.
- What?
That'll do it.
This is your bitch.
- Is this the wrong one?
- [Groans] Ohh...
[Door slams]
But why do I have to leave?
Hello.
I hope Mike's okay.
Is Mike okay?
Bye.
Hi.
Hello.
I love your car.
It's so pretty.
I think this is what it must feel like to be in the womb, but you probably can't do this with your arms.
You have such a pretty face.
Ha.
Where do you come from?
I come from Armenia.
Oh, is your whole family there?
- Yes.
- Are you sad about that?
Being alive is being sad.
[Gasps] Can I have a candy bar?
Yes, of course.
They're for customer, like you.
My business card is back there, too.
Maybe I can take you to the airport or something sometime, you know?
Your name is Tigran.
Ahh...
You would just go and buy these candies just for the people who ride in your car?
Of course.
I just go to the Costco.
That is so incredibly nice of you that you go all the way to the Costco to buy us these candies.
And I am so sorry about the Armenian genocide.
[Distant sures by the cave singers]

Hi, daddy.
You want to come visit me?
Yes, now is the perfect time.
I would love that!
Hey, dad.
I'm here to help you pack up.
Okay.
I think I'm gonna come out to Joshy next.
Okay.
Do you want me to be with you?
No, I'll do...
I'll do it alone.
Alright, well, I'll just have him come over here, then.
- Do you think he's ready?
- No, you never are.
It's like having a baby.
You know, just one day the baby shows up and you figure it out.
- Honey?
- What?
Are you okay with me?
Oh, God, yes.
- No, I'm happy.
- Yeah?
Yeah, it's... it's...
It's inspiring.
I mean, I'm so glad you get to be who you are.
That's what we should all be.
Not my business, but how long have you and Tammy been carrying on?
Not my business.
I can't stop thinking about her.
I... it's like... it's just, like, we just reconnected, after all this time, and it just happened.
Now we're just, like, connecting every second.
I cannot stop texting her.
You know, it's like, "What are you doing? "
"Eating a sandwich."
"How is it?" "It's amazing."
You know... the thing that you do when you're falling in love?
Not really.
So you're not in love with Len?
No.
I mean, whatever.
I mean, I...
I...
I'm...
I'm staying with Len.
I'm gonna stay with Len.
I'm happy to stay with Len.
I just... you know, I just wonder, you know, what would it feel like to be loved by someone who's actually moved by loving you?
Why don't you tell him what you want?
I don't want to have to tell someone.
That is... that is the whole...
You can't tell someone that.
Mm.
Which one of you are gonna take the encyclopedias?
None of us, dad.
Nobody in the world wants those.
These are the bicentennial encyclopedias.
Ugh.
Would it be okay with you if I just crashed here tonight?
Of course, sweetie.
But I wanted you to know that I was thinking about you, and...
I really loved your message earlier, so...
Please leave me more, 'cause when I hear your voice,
I feel better.
Okay, guess I'll go.
I'm sorry I keep calling you.
Hey, Kaya.
Don't know why you're not calling me back, and I'm sick of getting your voicemail, so, anyhoo, maybe you might want to think about answering your phone and saying hello?
♪ I don't want to be seen, I don't want to be heard ♪
♪ Ooh ooh ooh-ooh ♪
What's your ish?
♪ What do you want, Josh?
♪

One second, you guys.
What's up?
Where the fuck is Kaya?
She's not answering my calls.
- She's not answering my texts.
- I don't know, dude.
- Is she avoiding me?
- I couldn't tell you.
Did she not tell you that we might be getting married?
- Married?
- Yeah.
- I love her.
I proposed, okay?
- Oh, my God.
You weird, old, sad fellow.
Married?
Are you living in a fucking dream world?
Are you such a fetus that you've not been in love before?
- Yeah, like a million times.
- Thank you.
Why don't you help me out and make her call me back and make sure she's here for the meeting with Ryan.
- What do you want?
- You got to get over here, asap, 'cause dad's got me packing up all his crap to donate to Haddasah League, and it's now or never.
Um, no, I can't do that today.
What about the cereal boxes?
Do not think about touching those or opening those.
Yeah, it's too late, actually, for that, 'cause I already did.
Nice photos and letters of you and creepy Rita.
I almost forgot about you and the babysitter.
Okay.
A... okay, you know what?
Um, I'm coming.
Those the moon rocks?
You got 'em?
- Yeah.
- Can I see 'em?
Yes.
Okay, there they are.
- So it's just like "E, " really?
- Yeah.
But you know how with "E", you, like, you have to take Xanax when you're coming down, otherwise your brain hurts?
What?
No, nobody's ever told me that.
Great, I've been taking my ecstasy wrong for years.
Okay, so what's the plan?
I got Saturday and Sunday off.
Do you want to go Joshua Tree, which I realized I haven't been to since I was a kid?
I'm so sorry.
I feel like a jerk.
I had a plan that was, like, a sex thing.
And I didn't tell you that, that that was what I wanted to do with the guy from the park?
What guy from the park?
The trainer from the park.
You're hanging out with that guy?
Yeah, I went back, and like, we trained, and then we started fucking, and whatever.

H-how?
How are you overwhelmed?
'Cause we have Sylvia full-time.
I don't know if you're actually aware, but, um, I manage Sylvia, and, uh, and I'm on, like, four committees at Ivanhoe, and the parent outreach at the " J"...
I'm actually training for a triathlon.
I have to swim in the ocean to raise money for breast cancer, because I hope one day if I have breast cancer, somebody swims for me.
Babe...
Are you okay?
Like... do you feel okay?
Oh, my God.
I don't want you to be mad at me.
I'm not mad.
Ugh!
Okay, you know that co-op in college that I worked at?
I didn't tell you that I also lived there.
- I think you told me that.
- I did?
Okay, well, but I didn't tell you that I...
that... that I lived there... with... with Tammy.
Ohh...
Like, in my... in my... in my room with her.
In my bed, actually.
I was in love with her, Len.
I... am in love with her.
Well, I'm gonna call Dr. Schomberg,
- 'cause we haven't...
- No.
talked to anyone in a long time.
- Len, no.
- Yeah, I'm calling her right now.
No.
This doesn't... this has nothing to do with...
This isn't us.
This is me.
Len...
- We're gonna talk to her.
- It's me.
I'll get us an appointment, and we can talk to her.
Len, it's me.
It's me.
You're not allowed to do this, you know.
I don't know how not to.
I just came from Barry's.
I'm gonna have to call you back, okay, dad?
What is going on?
Tell me you did not tell him to fire me.
Yeah, I told him to fire you.
I mean, my God, what was I supposed to do?
I mean, you wouldn't drop the whole baby thing.
Yeah!
It's a big deal.
I don't know if you can appreciate this, but this is a fucking big deal for me.
I've been fucking shit up my whole life.
I'm trying to do the right thing.
By right thing you mean we live in the mountains, and I run around with milk spewing out of my boobs?
Okay, that was a stupid idea.
Because you care about me so much, Josh?
It was a stupid idea.
I'm sorry.
Josh, this is only the second time you've even been to my house, okay?
And it's not like I live in Venice.
Echo Park and Silver Lake are...
I don't even know where one stops and the other starts.
Okay, rampart.
Look...
You never asked me to come here.
I would come here if you asked me to.
A normal guy just comes.
Okay.
I'm here now.
I'm here now, and I will continue to come.
Um, I'm going in, and you're not invited.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Okay...
- Don't...
Kaya, how'd this happen?
Okay, look, we have a baby in there, and I don't think you realize how important that is.
I already had the abortion.
When?
Yesterday.
Took, like, four Tylenol.
I was totally fine.
I couldn't do it.
I just chickened out with Josh.
I'm really sorry about that.
- Boys are the hardest.
- Boys are the hardest.
- They are.
- Why?
Well, because they...
They never stop really seeing you as their father, and girls are just easier that way.
I think they're more sensitive.
Why don't we go out, huh?
Where?
Well, you know, we'll find some place in Weho, and we'll just go drink.
I have to come out to Ali.
Nothing feels right until I do that.
Mike, I need three glasses of water, please.
Shit's about to get weird.
Okay, if I get too crazy, you guys have to be my guides.
Really?
You think you can handle the two of us?
Oh, please.
You know I've been working out.
Ooh, we got a live one.
For you.
Bottoms up, freaks.
Ah.
Um, guys, that was actually just cyanide that we took.
I'm just kidding!
Hey, you've reached Tammy Cashman.
You know what to do, so do it.
Babe, I did it.
I left Len.
Oh, my God.
You know what?
I actually...
I think it's gonna be okay.
I think he's gonna be okay.
I just have to... tell the kids.
I'm...
I'm taking them to my dad's tomorrow.
Should I tell them tomorrow?
Oh, God, I don't know.
Where are you, honey?
I need to talk to you.
Will you call me, please?
Mm, I feel like I'm spooning a bear.
Ugh, this is how the cave women felt.
You know what you look like?
A cat.
Like a feral cat.
I had a cat when I was a kid.
We used to be kids.
Derek, Derek.
You're too far away from us.
- Why are you so far away?
- I don't know, I just...
I'm so fucking thirsty.
You should kiss me.
I'm 70% water.
Hi, Mike.
You're making me naked.
Mike's making me naked.
Ooh, is that my pussy?
- Yeah, that's your pussy.
- Where're you going?
I'm gonna give Mike your pussy so then Mike has Derek's pussy, 'cause I'm the vessel for you guys...
- What?
- So that you have to be in this room, fucking each other...
What?
- Because that's...
- No.
What you really want to be doing.
- No.
No.
- You really wanna be
- loving each other.
- What?
That'll do it.
This is your bitch.
- Is this the wrong one?
- Ohh...
But why do I have to leave?
Hello.
I hope Mike's okay.
Is Mike okay?
Bye.
Hi.
Hello.
I love your car.
It's so pretty.
I think this is what it must feel like to be in the womb, but you probably can't do this with your arms.
You have such a pretty face.
Ha.
Where do you come from?
I come from Armenia.
Oh, is your whole family there?
- Yes.
- Are you sad about that?
Being alive is being sad.
Can I have a candy bar?
Yes, of course.
They're for customer, like you.
My business card is back there, too.
Maybe I can take you to the airport or something sometime, you know?
Your name is Tigran.
Ahh...
You would just go and buy these candies just for the people who ride in your car?
Of course.
I just go to the Costco.
That is so incredibly nice of you that you go all the way to the Costco to buy us these candies.
And I am so sorry about the Armenian genocide.
Thank you, Tigran.
Listen, I hope you will give me five stars, eh?
You got it!
Five stars, all the way.
Be careful.
Hi, daddy.
You want to come visit me?
Yes, now is the perfect time.
I would love that!
(cork pops) Whoa, sorry, sorry.
Oh, my God!
You know that there is gonna be champagne at this party, right?
I know, I know.
But we're gonna get there and it's gonna be everyone congratulating you on your book, saying, "This is a revelation!
"You're gonna end poverty in our time.
"This is the greatest book anyone's ever written in any genre."
You're the only one that says that, sweetie.
Well, it's true.
So before I lose you to your adoring public,
I just want to take a moment, you and I, to celebrate the best year of our lives.
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
(grunts)
We go big tonight!
Easy there, buddy.
We're old people, remember?
We haven't even gone medium sized in forever.
And I cannot carry you home in this dress.
Sweetie, relax.
I got this.
Yeah, right.
I can see your whole future.
You are gonna be so hungover tomorrow.
I'm gonna be fine.
Hmm.
I made a vow, remember?
NARRATOR:
Kids... the story behind that vow took place the morning of Barney and Robin's wedding.
You see, after drinking way too much the night before, this is all your Uncle Barney remembers from the first two hours of his wedding day.
(gasps)
(roars)
And that's it.
Now here's how the rest of us remember those two hours.
(tape rewinding)
ROBIN:
Found him.
You know, he looks better than I thought he would.
Rise and shine.
Up and at 'em, let's do this.
There's a gas leak!
The building's on fire!
Your shoes don't match your belt!
(moaning)
BOTH:
Uh-oh.
(piano playing Wagner's "Bridal Chorus")
♪ How I Met Your Mother 9x18 ♪ Rally Original Air Date on February 24, 2014
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Okay, I think my fiancé peed himself a little.
Oh, tomorrow I'm gonna be able to say my husband peed himself a little.
(moaning) Don't worry.
I accidentally spilled some iced tea on him.
Oh, thank God.
(whispering):
I didn't really spill some iced tea on him.
Oh, God, this is bad.
We're doing family wedding pictures at the lighthouse in two hours.
My father is paying for the whole thing.
He's gonna kill Barney if he doesn't show up.
Come on, your dad's tough.
But won't he understand a good old fashioned hangover?
My father's recipe for a Bloody Mary trades out tomato juice for wolf's blood.
Ooh.
Ooh.
Bloody Mary?
Sounds more like a Bloody Scary.
I'm gonna say it again.
Bloody Mary?
Uh, hold on.
You guys are forgetting
Barney Stinson has a super power.
He can't take a bad photo.
(grunts) Okay, here.
Watch.
Guys, Barney may be dead.
MARSHALL:
That's it!
You know what?
We are all now seriously too old to keep doing this to ourselves!
I vow here and now that I shall never again get that drunk in my life!
NARRATOR:
Yeah, he'd wind up breaking that vow.
And I will not break that vow as sure as I will always have a full head of hair!
WOMAN:
In other elections today, in the race for New York State Supreme Court,
Judge Brad Morris...
Mmm, just look at him.
I would love to rub that down.
(clears throat) Sorry.
Has increased his sizable lead over Judge Marshall Eriksen.
It was supposed to be a victory party.
You ran a great campaign, baby.
Yeah, but it was the most stressful three weeks of my life!
And in other results, a surprise comeback.
We are now ready to call the New York State Supreme Court race for Judge Marshall Eriksen.
(all cheering)
We'll go to Judge Eriksen for a live statement in just a few minutes.
(slurring):
Come again for Judge Fudge?
As your next commissioner...
State Supreme Court judge.
...of Gotham City...
The State of New York.
...I vow to make Batman work harder.
I say shine that Bat-Signal even for small stuff.
Like, uh, shoveling snow.
Or, like, uh, if a police horse dumps out in the park.
LILY:
Okay, well, that will be all at this time, thank you.
That's all.
Okay.
Mmm, good night.
Never again!
I vow it!
I am more worried about the vows I have to take with this useless pile of garbage a few hours from now.
What do we do?
You guys see the irony here.
The only person who could possibly get
Barney back on his feet is Barney.
NARRATOR:
See, over the years, we'd all come to experience something Barney called...
Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir!
The most effective post-bender, head's-too-tender ender from here to Denver.
What's in it?
Glad you asked.
Ah, I take it back.
Columbia University, 1941...
I take it back, I take it back.
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whom we all know is most famous for being a world-class drunk, commissioned a top-secret scientific project-- develop an elixir to cure the common hangover.
And what brilliant scientific mind did boozy old FDR pick to head up this historic task?
TED:
Look.
My head really hurts.
Let's just speed this along.
You're clearly ripping off the story of the Manhattan Project, which was run by Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.
So I'm gonna guess it was your distant relative Barnert Stinsonheimer?
Somebody's read their history books.
The Too Many Manhattans Project hit a few snags at first.
The first batch exploded.
Which sounded kind of like this.
Boom!
Oh!
You suck.
Just let me finish.
But the second batch... sadly also exploded.
Boom!
Oh!
Why are you here right now?
Do you want to hear the story or not?
Absolutely not.
Please leave.
After some trial and error,
Dr. Stinsonheimer finally found the magic formula.
TED:
Hang on.
Funyuns?
Tantrum Soda?
Sure.
In 1941?
Sure.
They haven't made new Tantrum since then.
That stuff lasts a while.
Anyway, the elixir was such a success, he was awarded the Bro-bel Prize.
True story.
Boom!
Wh-Wh-Why?
That time I was just messing with you.
Just give me the stupid drink.
(groans)
NARRATOR:
And the craziest part was...
I-I feel better.
Over the years, each of us would discover that Barney's elixir actually worked.
Like, way better.
What's in this thing again?
Stinson family secret.
Oh, come on, you told me most of the ingredients in your story.
Just tell me the secret one.
Ha!
I'll never tell you.
I'll take it with me to my grave.
Damn it, Barney!
Why are you always so selfish?
!
We are trying to help you!
ROBIN:
Okay, we somehow have to get this leaky barf bag back on his feet before the wedding pictures.
Well, we know what Barney would want us to do.
WOMAN:
Say cheese.
ALL:
Cheese!
ROBIN:
No!
We are not doing Weekend at Barney's!
But that's the dream!
I can't believe I just said that.
Someone suggest something useful!
Okay, here's the plan.
Marshall, you and Ted go gather the ingredients we do know.
Robin, you wake up Barney long enough to find out the secret ingredient.
And I'll race down to the spa to keep my 8:15 mani and pedi.
Okay, let's do this!
Bitch?
Walk out that door and I tag in
Zabka as my maid of honor.
Okay, let's start simple.
Fresh ocean air.
Come on, baby.
BOTH:
Come on, honey.
Come on, love, yeah.
Baby, baby.
I'll get the elevator.
Oh, I should get some water.
Okay, so... accidentally throwing Barney down the stairs did not wake him up.
Nor did banging his head on each step as we dragged him back up here.
So, how do we wake him up long enough to tell us the final ingredient?
You know, when my sister and I had trouble getting up for school, my dad a few cute little tricks.
(growling)
I'll do it!
I swear to God I'll do it!
Your dad used to do this to you?
Well, it was with a Cabbage Patch doll and an ax.
But same idea.
Trust me.
I was never late for kindergarten again.
What?
Come on.
(Barney moaning)
(groans)
I second Marshall's vow.
I will never, ever get that drunk again.
NARRATOR:
Yeah.
She would.
LILY:
My baby boy's in college.
Did you pack enough undies?
Yes, Mom.
(shushes)
Your father did a lot of puking in these hallowed halls.
From-from binge studying.
(quietly):
Saved it.
That reminds me, mister.
No underage drinking.
No good comes from hanging out in bars and getting drunk.
But every story from your 20s starts in a bar.
Listen to your mother.
Oh, what are we gonna do without you in the house?
(groans)
We got him out of the house!
Drink up!
(grunts)
(whoops)
Oh...
You son of a bitch!
You son of a me!
All right, we got most of the ingredients on our list.
Ginger, bananas, Funyuns.
I cannot believe that minimart sold Tantrum.
It's been discontinued for years.
Uh, hey.
(clears throat)
Will you, uh, toss me that bottle?
Oh.
Yeah, we haven't done this forever.
(smacks lips)
Dude!
You're a grown man.
Why you throwing a Tantrum?
Nice!
So awesome!
So awesome!
Okay, there's only one more item on the list and... it's an odd one.
Grease?
Grease.
At the Farhampton Inn, we don't cook with grease.
Our menu is organic.
Farm to table, locally grown.
No "grease."
Sir,
I am from Minnesota, where every meal is cooked with grease.
And my father dubbed that food the tastiest eats in the whole gosh darn world, so...
And how is your father's health?
Point is, it tastes really good.
Also, uh, we need it to help a friend recover from a hangover.
Wait a second.
There's bacon right here.
And where there's bacon, there's bacon grease.
Which we throw out.
And we aren't making any more bacon today.
Not unless it all somehow gets eaten in the ten minutes before breakfast is over.
No, no, no!
Ted, do not give me that look!
A mountain of food.
A ticking clock?
Come on!
You live for this stuff!
No, I'm not a wild animal.
I'm a Columbia-educated lawyer, poised to become a judge before age 35.
And remind me, how did you celebrate getting accepted into Columbia?
You eat one eight-pound block of fudge in 12 minutes and you're marked for life.
You're not marked for life...
Big Fudge.
I'm out, okay?
You eat the bacon.
You know I can't.
I'm allergic.
Ted.
I've been trying to tell you this for years.
Your bacon allergy is a lie your mother made up so you'd eat healthy as a kid.
No, I'm just allergic to a lot of stuff.
Bacon, doughnuts,
Halloween candy.
Not saying thank you.
Oh, my God!
That bitch lied to me!
Okay, I'll-I'll do it.
But I...
look, I don't, I don't even know if I'll like bacon.
(sniffs)
Mm-hmm.
What do you think?
(choir humming)
I have seen the face of God.
Okay, there is one thing we haven't tried yet.
Making out with each other.
You really think that will wake him up?
Wake up who now?
(Barney moaning)
(groans)
Look at this soggy bag of snot.
That's it, I am joining Marshall's vow.
I am never, ever getting that drunk again.
NARRATOR:
Kids, you see where this is going.
Did last night really happen?
I think so.
Look, let's just agree.
Absolute silence for the rest of the day.
(baby crying)
(groans) (laughs)
Every time.
You want me to get her?
No, I got her.
(grunts)
Yeah, I know, I know.
(shushing)
Hey, Barney?
Yeah?
Whose baby is this?
Uh, pardon.
(speaks French)
How could you, Mom?
!
You had the map to heaven and you never showed me the way.
May you rot in the bacon-less hell that I've lived in my entire life.
Yeah, they-they, uh, crisp it up real nice here.
Don't they?
Mm-hmm.
What is that-- applewood smoked?
You know what, Ted, you've been going at it real hard.
Why don't you take a breather?
And I'll drive us home.
(growls)
Well, congratulations.
Here's your grease.
(grunts)
No!
I don't want to lose a finger.
(grunts)
Here.
Thanks.
All right, Ted, let's go.
No, no!
I finally found the one, Marshall.
Her name is Bacon.
You know, this would go great on one of my mom's LT sandwiches.
Buddy, you got to take it easy.
Never!
I got a lifetime without bacon to make up for.
I will keep eating and eating and eating...
Oh, God, help me.
I'm going down.
NARRATOR:
And that's the first and last time I ever ate bacon.
Not everything.
Lily Aldrin?
Let's make out.
(gasps)
Are you sure?
!
Yeah, baby, I'm sure.
Um... okay, well, you know what?
I mean... it probably won't even work.
And it was stupid.
I'm stupid.
(shushing)
You're beautiful.
(gasps)
More, more, more, more, more, more, more, more.
Whoa, he's awake!
How'd you do it?
!
Nothing special.
Hydration, patience.
Quick, before he passes out again.
Barney!
(grunts)
What's the secret ingredient in Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir?
Come on, stay with us.
The secret ingredient is... nothing.
ALL:
Huh?
I ate too much bacon.
Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir is a lie.
That's the secret.
You...
You know, I could use a little lie-down myself.
So, Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir is a lie?
Why would you lie about that?
Just to mess with us?
Like that one jerk in every high school who brings in fake mushrooms just to see who's gullible enough to think they're tripping?
Damn you, Ollie Gunderson.
I knew those shrooms tasted like Sea-Monkeys.
How do you know what Sea-Monkeys taste like?
My older brothers are not... the best people.
Why did you lie?
I... love you guys.
He loves us?
Let's throw him down the stairs again.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Think about it.
The first time Barney gave us that drink, those hangovers all happened at the worst possible moments.
Remember?
Marshall thought he botched day two of the bar exam, so he freaked out that night and got wasted?
Now I'm gonna miss the last day of the bar?
I'll never be a lawyer!
I should just go back to being a manager at Structure.
That ten percent off all vests sale?
That was my idea!
As was cutting the arms off all the shirts that weren't selling.
That's where I belong.
No, Marshall.
You're gonna be a lawyer.
(groans) No, I can't do it.
Yes, you can.
Your first day back live on the air is gonna be legend-- wait for it-- dary!
Your kindergarten field trip to the jackhammer and siren museum today... (groans) ...is gonna be legendary.
No, it's not.
Nothing's ever gonna be legendary again.
I-I'm never gonna recover from this.
It's just a hangover, Ted.
Not that!
I got left at the altar, Barney.
I'm now a guy who got left at the altar.
There's no coming back from that.
Drink this.
You're gonna be okay.
Barney made up the Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir so we would all believe that we could rally.
I mean, even though it's fake, it-it worked.
Like-like Dumbo's feather.
Dum-bro's feather.
A placebo.
Place-bro.
A sugar pill.
(gasps)
I...
He lied so we'd be okay.
Hmm.
Barney does love us.
I wish we could help him out the way he helped us.
But the wedding photos are in 20 minutes.
(groans) My dad's gonna be so pissed.
Yup.
Barney's a dead man.
(camera shutter clicking)
Barney?
You were always a bit... chatty and blond for my taste.
Like a woman.
But this new side of you-- quiet, steady?
I like it!
You've earned my respect today, son.
I request the highest of fives.
Oh, no.
Stay cool.
I got this.
BARNEY:
I don't believe this.
You did Weekend at Barney's.
And it worked.
God, today's gonna be all downhill from here.
That's what the bride wants to hear.
No, that's not what I meant.
I just mean Weekend at Barney's is a thousand times more amazing than our wedding could ever be.
I'm gonna get some more coffee.
I can't wait to see the photos!
Well, he bought it.
We lied out of love.
Look how happy he is.
I mean, he has no idea we had to cancel the wedding photos and my dad was so angry, he came up to our room and kicked Barney in the crotch.
And the best part is your dad has no idea.
He still loves me.
Hey, do anyone else's balls hurt?
MARSHALL:
And, look, some good came out of all this.
Seeing you like that, we all vowed never to get that drunk again.
Well, actually I didn't.
But I will now.
Never again.
Never again.
Never again.
Never...
Ow!
NARRATOR:
Kids, no matter how hard we try, even the best of us go a little too wild sometimes.
And in those moments, we all need someone who loves us to help us rally.
(groans)
(whispers):
Happy New Year.
Okay.
That was, that was way too loud.
You're practically screaming.
What you need is Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir.
Even if that means lying once in a while.
Does it work?
Totally works.
(gags)
It's normal, it's totally normal.
(groans)
(laughs) I love you so much.
I love you, too.
Whoop, whoop.
Better drink it fast.
BOTH:
Mommy!
Hey, look who it is!
Get her!
(all clamoring)
I can't believe we kissed today.
Weird.
I-I feel kind of bad that, um, Ted and Marshall missed it.
Hey, we should kiss one more time in front of them just to, like, blow their minds.
Right?
Nah, I don't think so.
Exactly, totally.
Ha-ha, guys, you don't get to see this kiss either.
So, where should we go?
Closet, patio?
Ooh, I think the sauna's open.
Well, I... actually... to be honest, it-it felt kind of weird to me.
Once was enough.
Totally.
We could kiss.
We could not kiss.
We could kiss.
Doesn't matter to me.
It's stupid.
I'm stupid.
So stupid.

Easy there, buddy.
We're old people, remember?
We haven't even gone medium sized in forever.
And I cannot carry you home in this dress.
Sweetie, relax.
I got this.
Yeah, right.
I can see your whole future.
You are gonna be so hungover tomorrow.
I'm gonna be fine.
Hmm.
I made a vow, remember?
Narrator:
Kids...
The story behind that vow
Took place the morning
Of barney and robin's wedding.
You see, after drinking way too much the night before,
This is all your uncle barney remembers
From the first two hours of his wedding day.
(gasps)
(roars)
And that's it.
Now here's how the rest of us
Remember those two hours.
(tape rewinding)
Robin:
Found him.
You know, he looks better than I thought he would.
Rise and shine.
Up and at 'em, let's do this.
There's a gas leak!
The building's on fire!
Your shoes don't match your belt!
(moaning)
Both:
Uh-oh.
(piano playing wagner's "bridal chorus") Okay, I think my fiancé
Peed himself a little.
Oh, tomorrow I'm gonna be able to say
My husband peed himself a little.
(moaning) don't worry.
I accidentally spilled some iced tea on him.
Oh, thank god.
(whispering):
I didn't really spill
Some iced tea on him.
Oh, god, this is bad.
We're doing family wedding pictures
At the lighthouse in two hours.
My father is paying for the whole thing.
He's gonna kill barney if he doesn't show up.
Come on, your dad's tough.
But won't he understand a good old fashioned hangover?
My father's recipe
For a bloody mary
Trades out tomato juice
For wolf's blood.
Ooh.
Ooh.
Bloody mary?
Sounds more like a bloody scary.
I'm gonna say it again.
Uh, hold on.
Bloody mary?
Sounds more...
You guys are forgetting
Barney stinson has a super power.
He can't take a bad photo.
(grunts) okay, here.
Watch.
Guys, barney may be dead.
Marshall:
That's it!
You know what?
We are all now seriously too old
To keep doing this to ourselves!
I vow here and now
That I shall never again get that drunk in my life!
Narrator:
Yeah, he'd wind up breaking that vow.
And I will not break that vow
As sure as I will always have a full head of hair!
Woman:
In other elections today,
In the race for new york state supreme court,
Judge brad morris...
Mmm, just look at him.
I would love to rub that down.
(clears throat) sorry.
Has increased his sizable lead
Over judge marshall eriksen.
It was supposed to be a victory party.
You ran a great campaign, baby.
Yeah, but it was the most stressful
Three weeks of my life!
And in other results, a surprise comeback.
We are now ready to call the new york state supreme court race
For judge marshall eriksen.
(all cheering)
We'll go to judge eriksen for a live statement
In just a few minutes.
(slurring):
Come again for judge fudge?
As your next commissioner...
State supreme court judge.
...Of gotham city...
The state of new york.
...I vow to make batman work harder.
I say
Shine that bat-signal even for small stuff.
Like, uh, shoveling snow.
Or, like, uh, if a police horse dumps out in the park.
Lily:
Okay, well, that will be
All at this time, thank you.
That's all.
Okay.
Mmm, good night.
Never again!
I vow it!
I am more worried about the vows I have to take
With this useless pile of garbage
A few hours from now.
What do we do?
You guys see the irony here.
The only person who could possibly get
Barney back on his feet
Is barney.
Narrator:
See, over the years,
We'd all come to experience
Something barney called...
Stinson's hangover fixer elixir!
The most effective
Post-bender, head's-too-tender ender
From here to denver.
What's in it?
Glad you asked.
Ah, I take it back.
Columbia university, 1941...
I take it back, I take it back.
President franklin delano roosevelt,
Whom we all know is most famous for being a world-class drunk,
Commissioned a top-secret scientific project--
Develop an elixir to cure the common hangover.
And what brilliant scientific mind did boozy old fdr pick
To head up this historic task?
Ted:
Look.
My head really hurts.
Let's just speed this along.
You're clearly ripping off
The story of the manhattan project,
Which was run by dr.
Robert oppenheimer.
So I'm gonna guess it was your distant relative Barnert stinsonheimer?
Somebody's read their history books.
The too many manhattans project
Hit a few snags at first.
The first batch exploded.
Which sounded kind of like this.
Boom!
Oh!
You suck.
Just let me finish.
But the second batch...
Sadly also exploded.
Boom!
Oh!
Why are you here right now?
Do you want to hear the story or not?
Absolutely not.
Please leave.
After some trial and error,
Dr. Stinsonheimer finally found
The magic formula.
Ted:
Hang on.
Funyuns?
Tantrum soda?
Sure.
In 1941?
Sure.
They haven't made new tantrum since then.
That stuff lasts a while.
Anyway, the elixir was such a success,
He was awarded the bro-bel prize.
True story.
Boom!
Wh-wh-why?
That time I was just messing with you.
Just give me the stupid drink.
(groans)
Narrator:
And the craziest part was...
I-I feel better.
Over the years, each of us would discover
That barney's elixir actually worked.
Like, way better.
What's in this thing again?
Stinson family secret.
Oh, come on, you told me most of the ingredients in your story.
Just tell me the secret one.
Ha!
I'll never tell you.
I'll take it with me to my grave.
Damn it, barney!
Why are you always so selfish?
!
We are trying to help you!
Robin:
Okay, we somehow have
Back on his feet before the wedding pictures.
Well, we know what barney would want us to do.
Woman:
Say cheese.
All:
Cheese!
Robin:
No!
We are not doing weekend at barney's!
But that's the dream!
I can't believe I just said that.
Someone suggest something useful!
Okay, here's the plan.
Marshall, you and ted go gather
The ingredients we do know.
Robin,
You wake up barney long enough
To find out the secret ingredient.
And I'll race down to the spa to keep my 8:15 mani and pedi.
Okay, let's do this!
Bitch?
Walk out that door and I tag in
Zabka as my maid of honor.
Okay, let's start simple.
Fresh ocean air.
Come on, baby.
Both:
Come on, honey.
Come on, love, yeah.
Baby, baby.
I'll get the elevator.
Oh, I should get some water.
Okay, so...
Accidentally throwing barney down the stairs
Did not wake him up.
Nor did banging his head on each step
As we dragged him back up here.
So, how do we wake him up long enough
To tell us the final ingredient?
You know, when my sister and I
Had trouble getting up for school,
My dad a few cute little tricks.
(growling)
I'll do it!
I swear to god I'll do it!
Your dad used to do this to you?
Well, it was with a cabbage patch doll and an ax.
But same idea.
Trust me.
I was never late for kindergarten again.
What?
Come on.
(barney moaning)
(groans)
I second marshall's vow.
I will never, ever get that drunk again.
Narrator:
Yeah.
She would.
Lily:
My baby boy's
In college.
Did you pack enough undies?
Yes, mom.
(shushes)
Your father did a lot of puking
In these hallowed halls.
From-from binge studying.
(quietly):
Saved it.
That reminds me, mister.
No underage drinking.
No good comes from hanging out
In bars and getting drunk.
But every story from your 20s starts in a bar.
Listen to your mother.
Oh, what are we gonna do without you in the house?
(groans)
We got him out of the house!
Drink up!
(grunts)
(whoops)
Oh...
You son of a bitch!
You son of a me!
All right, we got most of the ingredients on our list.
Ginger, bananas, funyuns.
I cannot believe that minimart sold tantrum.
It's been discontinued for years.
Uh, hey.
(clears throat)
Will you, uh, toss me that bottle?
Oh.
Yeah, we haven't done this forever.
(smacks lips)
Dude!
You're a grown man.
Why you throwing a tantrum?
Nice!
So awesome!
So awesome!
Okay, there's only
One more item on the list and...
It's an odd one.
Grease?
Grease.
At the farhampton inn, we don't cook with grease.
Our menu is organic.
Farm to table, locally grown.
No "grease."
Sir,
I am from minnesota,
Where every meal is cooked with grease.
And my father dubbed that food the tastiest eats
In the whole gosh darn world, so...
And how is your father's health?
Point is, it tastes really good.
Also, uh,
We need it to help a friend recover from a hangover.
Wait a second.
There's bacon right here.
And where there's bacon,
There's bacon grease.
Which we throw out.
And we aren't making any more bacon today.
Not unless it all somehow gets eaten in the ten minutes
Before breakfast is over.
No, no, no!
Ted, do not give me that look!
A mountain of food.
A ticking clock?
Come on!
You live for this stuff!
No, I'm not a wild animal.
I'm a columbia-educated lawyer,
Poised to become a judge before age 35.
And remind me, how did you celebrate
Getting accepted into columbia?
You eat one eight-pound block of fudge
In 12 minutes and you're marked for life.
You're not marked for life...
Big fudge.
I'm out, okay?
You eat the bacon.
You know I can't.
I'm allergic.
Ted.
I've been trying to tell you this for years.
Your bacon allergy is a lie
Your mother made up so you'd eat healthy as a kid.
No, I'm just allergic to a lot of stuff.
Bacon, doughnuts,
Halloween candy.
Not saying thank you.
Oh, my god!
That bitch lied to me!
Okay, I'll-I'll do it.
But I...
Look, I don't, I don't even know if I'll like bacon.
(sniffs)
Mm-hmm.
What do you think?
(choir humming)
I have seen the face of god.
Okay, there is one thing we haven't tried yet.
Making out with each other.
You really think that will wake him up?
Wake up who now?
(barney moaning)
(groans)
Look at this soggy bag of snot.
That's it, I am joining marshall's vow.
I am never, ever getting that drunk again.
Narrator:
Kids, you see where this is going.
Did last night really happen?
I think so.
Look, let's just agree.
Absolute silence for the rest of the day.
(baby crying)
(groans) (laughs)
Every time.
You want me to get her?
No, I got her.
(grunts)
Yeah, I know, I know.
(shushing)
Hey, barney?
Yeah?
Whose baby is this?
Uh, pardon.
(speaks french)
How could you, mom?
!
You had the map
To heaven and you never showed me the way.
May you rot in the bacon-less hell
That I've lived in my entire life.
Yeah, they-they, uh, crisp it up real nice here.
Don't they?
Mm-hmm.
What is that-- applewood smoked?
You know what, ted,
You've been going at it real hard.
Why don't you take a breather?
And I'll drive us home.
(growls)
Well, congratulations.
Here's your grease.
(grunts)
No!
I don't want to lose a finger.
(grunts)
Here.
Thanks.
All right, ted, let's go.
No, no!
I finally found the one, marshall.
Her name is bacon.
You know, this would go great on one of my mom's lt sandwiches.
Buddy, you got to take it easy.
Never!
I got a lifetime without bacon to make up for.
I will keep eating and eating
And eating...
Oh, god, help me.
I'm going down.
Narrator:
And that's the first
And last time I ever ate bacon.
He's not waking up!
I'm out of ideas!
We've tried everything!
Not everything.
Lily aldrin?
Let's make out.
(gasps)
Are you sure?
!
Yeah, baby, I'm sure.
Um...
Okay, well, you know what?
I mean...
It probably won't even work.
And it was stupid.
I'm stupid.
(shushing)
You're beautiful.
(gasps)
More, more, more, more, more, more, more, more.
Whoa, he's awake!
How'd you do it?
!
Nothing special.
Hydration, patience.
Quick, before he passes out again.
Barney!
(grunts)
What's the secret ingredient
In stinson's hangover fixer elixir?
Come on, stay with us.
The secret ingredient
Is...
Nothing.
All:
Huh?
I ate too much bacon.
Stinson's hangover fixer elixir
Is a lie.
That's the secret.
You...
You know, I could use a little lie-down myself.
So, stinson's hangover fixer elixir is a lie?
Why would you lie about that?
Like that one jerk in every high school
Who brings in fake mushrooms
Just to see who's gullible enough
To think they're tripping?
Damn you, ollie gunderson.
I knew those shrooms tasted like sea-monkeys.
How do you know what sea-monkeys taste like?
My older brothers are not...
The best people.
Why did you lie?
I...
Love you guys.
He loves us?
Let's throw him down the stairs again.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Think about it.
The first time barney
Gave us that drink,
Those hangovers all happened
At the worst possible moments.
Remember?
Marshall thought he botched day two
Of the bar exam, so he freaked out that night and got wasted?
Now I'm gonna miss the last day of the bar?
I'll never be a lawyer!
I should just go back to being a manager at structure.
That ten percent off all vests sale?
That was my idea!
As was cutting the arms off
All the shirts that weren't selling.
That's where I belong.
No, marshall.
You're gonna be a lawyer.
(groans) no, I can't do it.
Yes, you can.
Your first day back live on the air
Is gonna be legend-- wait for it--
Dary!
Your kindergarten field trip
To the jackhammer and siren museum today... (groans) ...Is gonna be legendary.
No, it's not.
Nothing's ever gonna be legendary again.
I-I'm never gonna recover from this.
It's just a hangover, ted.
Not that!
I got left at the altar, barney.
I'm now a guy who got left at the altar.
There's no coming back from that.
Drink this.
You're gonna be okay.
Barney made up the stinson's hangover fixer elixir
So we would all believe that we could rally.
I mean, even though it's fake, it-it worked.
Like-like dumbo's feather.
Dum-bro's feather.
A placebo.
Place-bro.
A sugar pill.
(gasps)
I...
He lied so we'd be okay.
Hmm.
Barney does love us.
I wish we could help him out the way he helped us.
But the wedding photos are in 20 minutes.
(groans) my dad's gonna be so pissed.
Yup.
Barney's a dead man.
(camera shutter clicking)
Barney?
You were always a bit...
Chatty and blond
For my taste.
Like a woman.
But this new side of you--
Quiet,
Steady?
I like it!
You've earned my respect today, son.
I request the highest of fives.
Oh, no.
Stay cool.
I got this.
Barney:
I don't believe this.
You did weekend at barney's.
And it worked.
God, today's gonna be all downhill from here.
That's what the bride wants to hear.
No, that's not what I meant.
I just mean weekend at barney's
Is a thousand times more amazing than our wedding could ever be.
I'm gonna get some more coffee.
I can't wait to see the photos!
Well, he bought it.
We lied out of love.
Look how happy he is.
I mean, he has no idea we had to cancel
The wedding photos and my dad was so angry,
He came up to our room and kicked barney in the crotch.
And the best part is your dad has no idea.
He still loves me.
Hey, do anyone else's balls hurt?
Marshall:
And, look,
Some good came out of all this.
Seeing you like that, we all vowed
Never to get that drunk again.
Well, actually I didn't.
But I will now.
Never again.
Never again.
Never again.
Never...
Ow!
Narrator:
Kids, no matter how hard we try,
Even the best of us go a little too wild sometimes.
And in those moments, we all need
Someone who loves us to help us rally.
(groans)
(whispers):
Happy new year.
Okay.
That was, that was way too loud.
You're practically screaming.
What you need
Is stinson's hangover fixer elixir.
Even if that means lying once in a while.
Does it work?
Totally works.
(gags)
It's normal, it's totally normal.
(groans)
(laughs) I love you so much.
I love you, too.
Whoop, whoop.
Better drink it fast.
Both:
Mommy!
Hey, look who it is!
Get her!
(all clamoring)
I can't believe we kissed today.
Weird.
I-I feel kind of bad
That, um, ted and marshall missed it.
Hey, we should kiss one more time
In front of them just to, like, blow their minds.
Right?
Nah, I don't think so.
Exactly, totally.
Ha-ha, guys, you don't get to see this kiss either.
So, where should we go?
Closet, patio?
Ooh, I think the sauna's open.
Well, I...
Actually...
To be honest, it-it felt kind of weird to me.
Once was enough.
Totally.
We could kiss.
We could not kiss.
We could kiss.
Doesn't matter to me.
It's stupid.
I'm stupid.
So stupid.
[CORK POPS]
- Whoa, sorry.
Sorry.
- Oh, my God.
You know there is gonna be champagne at this party?
I know, but we're gonna get there and it'll be everyone congratulating you on your book, saying:
"This is a revelation.
You're gonna end poverty in our time.
This is the greatest book anyone's ever written."
- You're the only one that says that.
- Well, it's true.
So before I lose you to your adoring public I just want to take a moment, you and I, to celebrate the best year of our lives.
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.
TED:
Mm.
- We go big tonight.
- Easy there, buddy.
We're old people, remember?
We haven't gone medium-sized in forever.
And I cannot carry you home in this dress.
Sweetie, relax.
I got this.
Yeah, right.
I can see your whole future.
You are gonna be so hungover tomorrow.
I'm gonna be fine.
I made a vow, remember?
TED:
Kids, the story behind that vow took place the morning of Barney and Robin's wedding.
You see, after drinking way too much the night before this is all Uncle Barney remembers from the first two hours of his wedding day:
[GASPS]
[ROARS]
And that's it.
Now, here's how the rest of us remember those two hours:
ROBIN:
Found him.
You know, he looks better than I thought he would.
Rise and shine.
Up and at them, let's do this.
There's a gas leak.
The building's on fire.
Your shoes don't match your belt.
[GRUNTING]
[IN UNISON] Uh-oh.
Okay, I think my fiancé peed himself a little.
Aw...
Tomorrow I'm gonna be able to say my husband peed himself a little.
- Don't worry, I spilled some iced tea on him.
- Oh, thank God.
[WHISPERS] I didn't really spill some iced tea on him.
Oh, God, this is bad.
We're doing family wedding pictures at the lighthouse in two hours.
My father is paying for it.
He'll kill him if he doesn't show up.
Come on, your dad's tough, but won't he understand an old-fashioned hangover?
My father's recipe for a Bloody Mary trades out tomato juice for wolf's blood.
ALL:
Ooh.
Bloody Mary?
Sounds more like a Bloody Scary.
I say again.
Bloody Mary?
Sounds...
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Uh, hold on, you guys are forgetting Barney Stinson has a super power.
He can't take a bad photo.
[BARNEY GRUNTS]
Okay, here.
Watch.
Guys, Barney may be dead.
That's it.
We are all now seriously too old to keep doing this to ourselves.
I vow here and now that I shall never again get that drunk in my life.
TED:
Yeah, he'd wind up breaking that vow.
And I will not break that vow, as sure as I will always have a full head of hair.
NEWS ANCHOR [ON TV]:
In other elections today, in the race for New York State Supreme Court, Judge Brad Morris...
Oh, oh!
Just look at him.
Oh, I would love to rub that down.
Ahem.
Sorry.
- Has increased his sizable lead over Judge Marshall Eriksen.
It was supposed to be a victory party.
You ran a great campaign, baby.
Yeah, but it was the most stressful three weeks of my life.
And in other results, a surprise comeback.
We're ready to call the New York State Supreme Court race for Judge Marshall Eriksen.
[ALL CHEERING]
We'll go to Judge Eriksen for a live statement in just a few minutes.
Come again for Judge Fudge?
- As your next commissioner...
- State Supreme Court Judge.
...of Gotham City...
- The State of New York.
...I vow to make Batman work harder.
I say shine that Bat-Signal even for small stuff like, uh, shoveling snow or like, uh, if a police horse dumps out in the park.
Okay, that will be all at this time, thank you.
- That's all.
- Okay.
Good night.
Never again.
I vow it.
I'm more worried about taking vows with this pile of garbage in a few hours.
- What do we do?
- You guys see the irony here?
The only person who could possibly get Barney back on his feet is Barney.
TED:
See, over the years, we'd all come to experience something Barney called:
Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir.
The most effective post-bender-head's- too-tender-ender from here to Denver.

- Just tell me the secret one.
- Ha!
I'll never tell you.
I'll take it with me to my grave.
Damn it, Barney, why are you always so selfish?
We are trying to help you.
Okay, we have to get this leaky barf bag back on his feet before the wedding pictures.
We know what Barney would want to do.
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Say cheese.
ALL:
Cheese.
No, we are not doing Weekend at Barney's.
But that's the dream.
I can't believe I just said that.
- Someone suggest something useful.
- Here's the plan.
Marshall, you and Ted go gather the ingredients we do know.
Robin, you wake up Barney long enough to find out the secret ingredient.
And I'll race down to the spa to keep my 8:15 mani and pedi.

- Bitch walk out that door and Zabka is my maid of honor.
Okay, let's start simple:

- Come on, baby.

Come on, honey.
ROBIN:
Come on, love.
Yeah.
- Baby.
All right, I'll get the elevator.
Oh, I should get some water.
[LILY ROBIN GRUNT]
Okay.
So accidentally throwing Barney down the stairs did not wake him up.
Nor did banging his head on each step as we dragged him back up here.
So how do we wake him up long enough to tell us the final ingredient?
When my sister and I had trouble getting up for school my dad had a few cute tricks.
[BEAR ROARING]
I'll do it!
I swear to God I'll do it!
Your dad used to do this to you?
With a Cabbage Patch doll and ax, but same idea.
Trust me, I was never late for kindergarten again.
What?
Come on.
[GRUNTING]
Ugh.
I second Marshall's vow.
I will never ever get that drunk again.
TED:
Yeah, she would.
My baby boy's in college.
Did you pack enough undies?
Yes, Mom.
Shh.
Your father did a lot of puking in these hallowed halls from binge studying.
Saved it.
That reminds me, mister, no underage drinking.
No good comes from hanging out in bars and getting drunk.
But every story from your 20's starts in a bar.
- Listen to your mother.
- Aw...
What are we gonna do without you in the house?
LILY:
We got him out of the house.
Drink up.
Mm.
Whoo!
Oh, boy.
- You son of a bitch.
- You son of a me.
All right, we got most of the ingredients on our list:
Ginger, bananas, Funyuns.
I can't believe that mini-mart sold Tantrum.
It's been discontinued for years.
- Uh, hey, ahem, will you toss me that bottle?
- Yeah, we haven't done this forever.
Dude, you're a grown man, why are you throwing a Tantrum?
- Nice.
- So awesome.
- So awesome.
- Okay, there's one more item on the list and it's an odd one.
- Grease?
- Grease.
At the Farhampton Inn, we don't cook with grease.
Our menu is organic, farm-to-table, locally grown.
No "grease."
Sir, I am from Minnesota where every meal is cooked with grease and my father dubbed it:
"The tastiest eats in the whole gosh darn world," so...

And where there's bacon there's bacon grease.
- Which we throw out.
We aren't making any more bacon today.
Not unless it all somehow gets eaten in the 10 minutes before breakfast is over.
No, no, no.
Ted, do not give me that look.
A mountain of food, a ticking clock?
Come on, you live for this stuff.
No, I'm not a wild animal.
I'm a Columbia-educated lawyer, poised to become ajudge before age 35.
And remind me, how did you celebrate getting accepted into Columbia?
You eat one 8-pound block of fudge in 12 minutes and you're marked for life.
You're not marked for life, Big Fudge.
I'm out, okay?
You eat the bacon.
You know I can't, I'm allergic.
Ted, I've been trying to tell you for years, your bacon allergy is a lie your mother made up so you'd eat healthy.
No, I'm just allergic to a lot of stuff.
Bacon, donuts, Halloween candy not saying "thank you."
Oh, my God, that bitch lied to me.
Okay, I'll do it.
But, look, I don't even know if I'll like bacon.
[SNIFFS]
What do you think?
I have seen the face of God.
Okay, there is one thing we haven't tried yet:
Making out with each other.
- You really think that will wake him up?
- Wake up who now?
[BARNEY GRUNTING]
Ugh.
Look at this soggy bag of snot.
That's it, I am joining Marshall's vow.
I am never, ever getting that drunk again.
TED:
Kids, you see where this is going.
Did last night really happen?
I think so.
Look, let's just agree:
Absolute silence for the rest of the day.
[BABY CRYING]
- Oh...
- Ha-ha-ha.
Every time.
You want me to get her?
No, I got her.
Come here.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Shh, shh, shh.
Shh.
- Hey, Barney?
- Yeah?
Whose baby is this?
[IN SPANISH]
[ALL SPEAKING IN SPANISH]
[BABY CRYING]
[SPEAKS IN FRENCH]
How could you, Mom?
You had the map to heaven and you never showed me the way.
May you rot in the bacon-less hell that I've lived in my entire life.
- They crisp it up real nice here, don't they?
- Mm-hm.
What is that?
Applewood smoked?
Ted, you've been going at it real hard why don't you take a breather and I'll drive us home?
[SNARLS]
- Well, congratulations.
Here's your grease.
TED:
Mm.
- No.
I don't want to lose a finger.
TED:
Mm.
Mm.
- Here.
- All right, Ted, let's go.
No.
No.
I finally found the one, Marshall.
Her name is Bacon.
You know, this would go great on one of my mom's LT sandwiches.
- Okay, buddy, you gotta take it easy.
- Never!
I've got a lifetime without bacon to make up for.
I will keep eating and eating and eating...
Oh, God, help me, I'm going down.
TED:
And that's the first and last time I ever ate bacon.
He's not waking up.
I'm out of ideas.
We've tried everything.
Not everything.
Lily Aldrin, let's make out.
[GASPS]
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, baby.
I'm sure.
Um...
Okay, well, you know what?
I mean it probably won't even work.
It's stupid, I'm stupid.
Shh, shh, shh.
You're beautiful.
Come here.
[BARNEY GASPS]
More, more, more.
Whoa, he's awake.
How'd you do it?
- Nothing special.
- Hydration, patience.
Quick, before he passes out again.
Barney what's the secret ingredient in Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir?
Come on, stay with us.
The secret ingredient is nothing.
ALL:
Huh?
I ate too much bacon.
Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir is a lie.
That's the secret.
You know, I could use a little lie-down myself.
So Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir is a lie?
- Why would you lie about that?
- Just to mess with us?
Like that jerk in high school who brings fake mushrooms to see who's gullible enough to trip?
- Damn you, OIlie Gunderson.
I knew those shrooms tasted like Sea-Monkeys.
- How do you know what they taste like?
- My older brothers are not the best people.
- Why did you lie?
I love you guys.
He loves us?
- Let's throw him down the stairs again.
TED MARSHALL:
Yeah.
Wait, think.
The first time Barney gave us that drink those hangovers all happened at the worst possible moments.
Remember?
Marshall thought he botched the bar exam so he freaked out and got wasted?
Now I'm gonna miss the last day of the bar.
I'll never be a lawyer.
I should just go back to being a manager at Structure.
That "10 percent off all vests" sale?
That was my idea.
As was cutting the arms off the shirts that weren't selling.
That's where I belong.
No, Marshall, you're gonna be a lawyer.
- Ugh.
No, I can't do it.
- Yes, you can.
Your first day back, live on the air, is gonna be legen...
Wait for it.
- Dary.
Your kindergarten field trip to the Jackhammer and Siren Museum today is gonna be legendary.
No, it's not.
Nothing's ever gonna be legendary again, I'm never gonna recover from this.
- It's just a hangover, Ted.
- Not that.
I got left at the altar, Barney.
I'm now a guy who got left at the altar.
There's no coming back from that.
Drink this.
You're gonna be okay.
Barney made up the Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir so we would all believe that we could rally.
Even though it's fake, it worked.
- Like Dumbo's feather.
- Dum-bro's feather.
- A placebo.
- Place-bro.
A sugar pill.
[GRUNTS]
He lied so we'd be okay.
Barney does love us.
I wish we could help him out the way he helped us.
- But the wedding photos are in 20 minutes.
- My dad's gonna be so pissed.
Yep, Barney's a dead man.
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING]
Barney, you were always a bit chatty and blond for my taste.
You're like a woman.
But this new side of you quiet, steady, I like it.
You've earned my respect today, son.
- I request the highest of fives.
- Oh, no.
Stay cool, we got this.
[CHUCKLES]
BARNEY:
I don't believe this.
You did Weekend at Barney's and it worked.
God, today's gonna be all downhill from here.
- That's what the bride wants to hear.
- Ha, ha.
No, that's not what I meant.
I just mean Weekend at Barney's is way more amazing than our wedding could be.
I'm gonna get more coffee.
I can't wait to see the photos.
Well, he bought it.
We lied out of love.
Look how happy he is.
He has no idea we had to cancel the photos and my dad came up and kicked Barney in the crotch.
And the best part is, your dad has no idea.
He still loves me.
Hey, do anyone else's balls hurt?
And some good came out of this, seeing you like that we all vowed never to get that drunk again.
Well, actually, I didn't, but I will now.
- Never again.
ALL:
Never again.
TED:
Kids, no matter how hard we try even the best of us go a little too wild sometimes.
And in those moments, we all need someone who loves us to help us rally.
[GRUNTS]
[SIGHS]
- [WHISPERS] Happy New Year.
- Okay, that was way too loud.
You're practically screaming.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] What you need is Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir.
TED:
Even if that means lying once in a while.
- Does it work?
- Totally works.
[GAGS]
It's normal.
It's totally normal.
- I love you so much.
- I love you too.
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
Oop, oop.
Better drink it fast.
BOTH:
Mommy!
- Hey, look who it is!
Get her!
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
Heh.
I can't believe we kissed today.
Weird.
Heh.
I feel kind of bad that Ted and Marshall missed it.
Hey, we should kiss one more time in front of them just to, like, blow their minds, right?
- No, I don't think so.
- Exactly.
Totally.
Ha, ha.
"Ha, ha, guys, you don't get to see this kiss either." Ha-ha-ha.
So where should we go?
Closet?
Patio?
Ooh, I think the sauna's open.
Well, actually to be honest, it felt kind of weird to me.
- Once was enough.
- Totally.
We could kiss, we could not kiss.
We could kiss, doesn't matter to me.
It's stupid.
I'm stupid.
So stupid.
Whoa, sorry, sorry.
Oh, my God!
You know that there is gonna be champagne at this party, right?
I know, I know.
But we're gonna get there and it's gonna be everyone congratulating you on your book, saying, "This is a revelation!
"You're gonna end poverty in our time.
"This is the greatest book anyone's ever written in any genre."
You're the only one that says that, sweetie.
Well, it's true.
So before I lose you to your adoring public,
I just want to take a moment, you and I, to celebrate the best year of our lives.
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
We go big tonight!
Easy there, buddy.
We're old people, remember?
We haven't even gone medium sized in forever.
And I cannot carry you home in this dress.
Sweetie, relax.
I got this.
Yeah, right.
I can see your whole future.
You are gonna be so hungover tomorrow.
I'm gonna be fine.
Hmm.
I made a vow, remember?
Kids... the story behind that vow took place the morning of Barney and Robin's wedding.
You see, after drinking way too much the night before, this is all your Uncle Barney remembers from the first two hours of his wedding day.
And that's it.
Now here's how the rest of us remember those two hours.
Found him.
You know, he looks better than I thought he would.
Rise and shine.
Up and at 'em, let's do this.
There's a gas leak!
The building's on fire!
Your shoes don't match your belt!
Uh-oh.

Okay, I think my fiancé peed himself a little.
Oh, tomorrow I'm gonna be able to say my husband peed himself a little.
Don't worry.
I accidentally spilled some iced tea on him.
Oh, thank God.
I didn't really spill some iced tea on him.
Oh, God, this is bad.
We're doing family wedding pictures at the lighthouse in two hours.
My father is paying for the whole thing.
He's gonna kill Barney if he doesn't show up.
Come on, your dad's tough.
But won't he understand a good old fashioned hangover?
My father's recipe for a Bloody Mary trades out tomato juice for wolf's blood.
Ooh.
Ooh.
Bloody Mary?
Sounds more like a Bloody Scary.
I'm gonna say it again.
Bloody Mary?
Uh, hold on.
You guys are forgetting
Barney Stinson has a super power.
He can't take a bad photo.
Okay, here.
Watch.
Guys, Barney may be dead.
That's it!
You know what?
We are all now seriously too old to keep doing this to ourselves!
I vow here and now that I shall never again get that drunk in my life!
Yeah, he'd wind up breaking that vow.
And I will not break that vow as sure as I will always have a full head of hair!
In other elections today, in the race for New York State Supreme Court,
Judge Brad Morris...
Mmm, just look at him.
I would love to rub that down.
Sorry.
Has increased his sizable lead over Judge Marshall Eriksen.
It was supposed to be a victory party.
You ran a great campaign, baby.
Yeah, but it was the most stressful three weeks of my life!
And in other results, a surprise comeback.
We are now ready to call the New York State Supreme Court race for Judge Marshall Eriksen.
We'll go to Judge Eriksen for a live statement in just a few minutes.
Come again for Judge Fudge?
As your next commissioner...
State Supreme Court judge.
...of Gotham City...
The State of New York.
...I vow to make Batman work harder.
I say shine that Bat-Signal even for small stuff.
Like, uh, shoveling snow.
Or, like, uh, if a police horse dumps out in the park.
Okay, well, that will be all at this time, thank you.
That's all.
Okay.
Mmm, good night.
Never again!
I vow it!
I am more worried about the vows I have to take with this useless pile of garbage a few hours from now.
What do we do?
You guys see the irony here.
The only person who could possibly get
Barney back on his feet is Barney.
See, over the years, we'd all come to experience something Barney called...
Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir!
The most effective post-bender, head's-too-tender ender from here to Denver.
What's in it?
Glad you asked.
Ah, I take it back.
Columbia University, 1941...
I take it back, I take it back.
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whom we all know is most famous for being a world-class drunk, commissioned a top-secret scientific project-- develop an elixir to cure the common hangover.
And what brilliant scientific mind did boozy old FDR pick
- to head up this historic task?
- Look.
My head really hurts.
Let's just speed this along.
You're clearly ripping off the story of the Manhattan Project, which was run by Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.
So I'm gonna guess it was your distant relative Barnert Stinsonheimer?
Somebody's read their history books.
The Too Many Manhattans Project hit a few snags at first.
The first batch exploded.
Which sounded kind of like this.
Boom!
Oh!
You suck.
Just let me finish.
But the second batch... sadly also exploded.
Boom!
Oh!
Why are you here right now?
Do you want to hear the story or not?
Absolutely not.
Please leave.
After some trial and error,
Dr. Stinsonheimer finally found the magic formula.
Hang on.
Funyuns?
Tantrum Soda?
Sure.
In 1941?
Sure.
They haven't made new Tantrum since then.
That stuff lasts a while.
Anyway, the elixir was such a success, he was awarded the Bro-bel Prize.
True story.
Boom!
Wh-Wh-Why?
That time I was just messing with you.
Just give me the stupid drink.
And the craziest part was...
I-I feel better.
Over the years, each of us would discover that Barney's elixir actually worked.
Like, way better.
What's in this thing again?
Stinson family secret.
Oh, come on, you told me most of the ingredients in your story.
Just tell me the secret one.
Ha!
I'll never tell you.
I'll take it with me to my grave.
Damn it, Barney!
Why are you always so selfish?
!
We are trying to help you!
Okay, we somehow have to get this leaky barf bag back on his feet before the wedding pictures.
Well, we know what Barney would want us to do.
Say cheese.
Cheese!
No!
We are not doing Weekend at Barney's!
But that's the dream!
I can't believe I just said that.
Someone suggest something useful!
Okay, here's the plan.
Marshall, you and Ted go gather the ingredients we do know.
Robin, you wake up Barney long enough to find out the secret ingredient.
And I'll race down to the spa to keep my 8:15 mani and pedi.
Okay, let's do this!
Bitch?
Walk out that door and I tag in
Zabka as my maid of honor.
Okay, let's start simple.
Fresh ocean air.
Come on, baby.
Come on, honey.
Come on, love, yeah.
Baby, baby.
I'll get the elevator.
Oh, I should get some water.
Okay, so... accidentally throwing Barney down the stairs did not wake him up.
Nor did banging his head on each step as we dragged him back up here.
So, how do we wake him up long enough to tell us the final ingredient?
You know, when my sister and I had trouble getting up for school, my dad a few cute little tricks.
I'll do it!
I swear to God I'll do it!
Your dad used to do this to you?
Well, it was with a Cabbage Patch doll and an ax.
But same idea.
Trust me.
I was never late for kindergarten again.
What?
Come on.
I second Marshall's vow.
I will never, ever get that drunk again.
Yeah.
She would.
My baby boy's in college.
Did you pack enough undies?
Yes, Mom.
Your father did a lot of puking in these hallowed halls.
From-from binge studying.
Saved it.
That reminds me, mister.
No underage drinking.
No good comes from hanging out in bars and getting drunk.
But every story from your 20s starts in a bar.
Listen to your mother.
Oh, what are we gonna do without you in the house?
We got him out of the house!
Drink up!
Oh...
You son of a bitch!
You son of a me!
All right, we got most of the ingredients on our list.
Ginger, bananas, Funyuns.
I cannot believe that minimart sold Tantrum.
It's been discontinued for years.
Uh, hey.
Will you, uh, toss me that bottle?
Oh.
Yeah, we haven't done this forever.
Dude!
You're a grown man.
Why you throwing a Tantrum?
Nice!
So awesome!
So awesome!
Okay, there's only one more item on the list and... it's an odd one.
Grease?
Grease.
At the Farhampton Inn, we don't cook with grease.
Our menu is organic.
Farm to table, locally grown.
No "grease."
Sir,
I am from Minnesota, where every meal is cooked with grease.
And my father dubbed that food the tastiest eats in the whole gosh darn world, so...
And how is your father's health?
Point is, it tastes really good.
Also, uh, we need it to help a friend recover from a hangover.
Wait a second.
There's bacon right here.
And where there's bacon, there's bacon grease.
Which we throw out.
And we aren't making any more bacon today.
Not unless it all somehow gets eaten in the ten minutes before breakfast is over.
No, no, no!
Ted, do not give me that look!
A mountain of food.
A ticking clock?
Come on!
You live for this stuff!
No, I'm not a wild animal.
I'm a Columbia-educated lawyer, poised to become a judge before age 35.
And remind me, how did you celebrate getting accepted into Columbia?
You eat one eight-pound block of fudge in 12 minutes and you're marked for life.
You're not marked for life...
Big Fudge.
I'm out, okay?
You eat the bacon.
You know I can't.
I'm allergic.
Ted.
I've been trying to tell you this for years.
Your bacon allergy is a lie your mother made up so you'd eat healthy as a kid.
No, I'm just allergic to a lot of stuff.
Bacon, doughnuts,
Halloween candy.
Not saying thank you.
Oh, my God!
That bitch lied to me!
Okay, I'll-I'll do it.
But I...
look, I don't, I don't even know if I'll like bacon.
Mm-hmm.
What do you think?
I have seen the face of God.
Okay, there is one thing we haven't tried yet.
Making out with each other.
You really think that will wake him up?
Wake up who now?
Look at this soggy bag of snot.
That's it, I am joining Marshall's vow.
I am never, ever getting that drunk again.
Kids, you see where this is going.
Did last night really happen?
I think so.
Look, let's just agree.
Absolute silence for the rest of the day.
Every time.
You want me to get her?
No, I got her.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Hey, Barney?
Yeah?
Whose baby is this?
Uh, pardon.
How could you, Mom?
!
You had the map to heaven and you never showed me the way.
May you rot in the bacon-less hell that I've lived in my entire life.
Yeah, they-they, uh, crisp it up real nice here.
Don't they?
Mm-hmm.
What is that-- applewood smoked?
You know what, Ted, you've been going at it real hard.
Why don't you take a breather?
And I'll drive us home.
Well, congratulations.
Here's your grease.
No!
I don't want to lose a finger.
Here.
Thanks.
All right, Ted, let's go.
No, no!
I finally found the one, Marshall.
Her name is Bacon.
You know, this would go great on one of my mom's LT sandwiches.
Buddy, you got to take it easy.
Never!
I got a lifetime without bacon to make up for.
I will keep eating and eating and eating...
Oh, God, help me.
I'm going down.
And that's the first and last time I ever ate bacon.
Not everything.
Lily Aldrin?
Let's make out.
Are you sure?
!
Yeah, baby, I'm sure.
Um... okay, well, you know what?
I mean... it probably won't even work.
And it was stupid.
I'm stupid.
You're beautiful.
More, more, more, more, more, more, more, more.
Whoa, he's awake!
How'd you do it?
!
Nothing special.
Hydration, patience.
Quick, before he passes out again.
Barney!
What's the secret ingredient in Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir?
Come on, stay with us.
The secret ingredient is... nothing.
Huh?
I ate too much bacon.
Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir is a lie.
That's the secret.
You...
You know, I could use a little lie-down myself.
So, Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir is a lie?
Why would you lie about that?
Just to mess with us?
Like that one jerk in every high school who brings in fake mushrooms just to see who's gullible enough to think they're tripping?
Damn you, Ollie Gunderson.
I knew those shrooms tasted like Sea-Monkeys.
How do you know what Sea-Monkeys taste like?
My older brothers are not... the best people.
Why did you lie?
I... love you guys.
He loves us?
Let's throw him down the stairs again.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Think about it.
The first time Barney gave us that drink, those hangovers all happened at the worst possible moments.
Remember?
Marshall thought he botched day two of the bar exam, so he freaked out that night and got wasted?
Now I'm gonna miss the last day of the bar?
I'll never be a lawyer!
I should just go back to being a manager at Structure.
That ten percent off all vests sale?
That was my idea!
As was cutting the arms off all the shirts that weren't selling.
That's where I belong.
No, Marshall.
You're gonna be a lawyer.
No, I can't do it.
Yes, you can.
Your first day back live on the air is gonna be legend-- wait for it-- dary!
Your kindergarten field trip to the jackhammer and siren museum today is gonna be legendary.
No, it's not.
Nothing's ever gonna be legendary again.
I-I'm never gonna recover from this.
It's just a hangover, Ted.
Not that!
I got left at the altar, Barney.
I'm now a guy who got left at the altar.
There's no coming back from that.
Drink this.
You're gonna be okay.
Barney made up the Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir so we would all believe that we could rally.
I mean, even though it's fake, it-it worked.
Like-like Dumbo's feather.
Dum-bro's feather.
A placebo.

I...
He lied so we'd be okay.
Hmm.
Barney does love us.
I wish we could help him out the way he helped us.
But the wedding photos are in 20 minutes.
My dad's gonna be so pissed.
Yup.

You were always a bit... chatty and blond for my taste.

But this new side of you-- quiet, steady?
I like it!
You've earned my respect today, son.
I request the highest of fives.
Oh, no.
Stay cool.
I got this.
I don't believe this.
You did Weekend at Barney's.
And it worked.
God, today's gonna be all downhill from here.
That's what the bride wants to hear.
No, that's not what I meant.
I just mean Weekend at Barney's is a thousand times more amazing than our wedding could ever be.
I'm gonna get some more coffee.
I can't wait to see the photos!
Well, he bought it.
We lied out of love.
Look how happy he is.
I mean, he has no idea we had to cancel the wedding photos and my dad was so angry, he came up to our room and kicked Barney in the crotch.
And the best part is your dad has no idea.
He still loves me.
Hey, do anyone else's balls hurt?
And, look, some good came out of all this.
Seeing you like that, we all vowed never to get that drunk again.
Well, actually I didn't.
But I will now.
Never again.
Never again.
Never again.
Never...
Ow!
Kids, no matter how hard we try, even the best of us go a little too wild sometimes.
And in those moments, we all need someone who loves us to help us rally.
Happy New Year.
Okay.
That was, that was way too loud.
You're practically screaming.
What you need is Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir.
Even if that means lying once in a while.
Does it work?
Totally works.
It's normal, it's totally normal.
I love you so much.
I love you, too.
Whoop, whoop.
Better drink it fast.
Mommy!
Hey, look who it is!
Get her!
I can't believe we kissed today.
Weird.
I-I feel kind of bad that, um, Ted and Marshall missed it.
Hey, we should kiss one more time in front of them just to, like, blow their minds.
Right?
Nah, I don't think so.
Exactly, totally.
Ha-ha, guys, you don't get to see this kiss either.
So, where should we go?
Closet, patio?
Ooh, I think the sauna's open.
Well, I... actually... to be honest, it-it felt kind of weird to me.
Once was enough.
Totally.
We could kiss.
We could not kiss.
We could kiss.
Doesn't matter to me.
It's stupid.
I'm stupid.
So stupid.

Give it back, Kevin.
The camera is Emma's, not yours.

Emma, that's you.
You must be... 13, maybe 14.
Are you missing the part where she's with the Snow Queen?
Emma, you knew her before you came to Storybrooke?
Apparently my run-in with her in town wasn't the only memory she erased.
All this time in this foster home, or whatever that place was... it's gone.
Look, I-I just don't understand how she even ended up in this world.
We were hoping Gold could tell us that.
You spent more time trying to get here than anyone.
How the hell did she do it?
Considering the time I spent on the same task,
I'd love to know.
Does it really matter how she got to Emma?
I mean, shouldn't we be more concerned about why?
Obviously, she needed her for something.
But what?
[Scoffs] Well, that's our next problem.
Well, we know she's hiding somewhere in the north woods.
We combed every inch of her shop.
We tore apart her house.
She must have cleared everything out days before.
Which means she must be hiding something.
But where?
What about her ice-cream truck?
Whoa, Snow Queen has an ice-cream truck?
I'm a kid.
I notice these kind of things.
Then we split up into groups.
We search the town, the woods.
Hook, Regina, Emma, you take the west.
Gold, you're with me for the east.
I think we all know I work best alone.
Well, no time to argue that.
Belle, how are you at tracking?
Uh, actually, I-I think I'll be more helpful at the library.
Maybe I can dig something up on the Snow Queen.
I'd like to come with you, Belle, if that's okay.
Maybe something about my sister will be there, too.
Unless you'd rather not have the company?
No, n-not at all.
I would love some.
It's late.
You should be in bed.
How can I possibly sleep when I can't even remember what happened to mother?
- Perhaps that's for the best.
- No!
I need to know what happened to her after I blacked out.
You won't find the answers you seek in the pages of a book.
But I already have, father.
According to this, there are creatures who can restore memories that have been lost.
If we journey to them, maybe they can help me remember what happened to mother.
I can't allow you to do that.
Why not?
Because there's something this book doesn't tell you.
Magic always comes with a price.
And whatever that price is,
I don't want you to have to pay it.
I'm sorry, Belle, but I've already lost your mother to this infernal ogres war.
I can't lose you, too.
- But father...
- You heard me!
No, no!
Forget this nonsense!
You are not to leave this chamber until the doctors say you're better!
[Door closes]
I'm sorry, father, but I need to know what happened.
And this...
Is the only place where I'll find the answer.
Arendelle.
There doesn't seem to be anything on Arendelle here.
Do you know where to look?
No, I'm...
I'm sorry.
I'm...
I'm really not that familiar with Arendelle, o-or... or your sister.
Elsa?
Anna!
Oh!
Oh, I was worried I'd never see you again.
I'm afraid you're stuck with me.
I'm sorry I left without telling you.
Oh, and I'm sorry I made you feel like you had to.
I know you did it for me, to try to make me feel better.
[Sighs]
So, what did you learn?
Did you discover why our parents went to the enchanted forest?
What is it, Anna?
What did you find?
Nothing.
I mean, I'm still waiting on some answers from a few people I met, but I wouldn't expect anything anytime soon because they have to find it out, then get on a ship and come here.
It could take a while, a long while, and...
Wait, no flurries?
No frost on the windows?
Usually a conversation about our parents ends with a chill in the air.
I've been learning to control my powers when I get upset.
Really?
How?
By training with me.
Who is that?
I mean, who are you?
I-I mean...
Hi.
She's our aunt.
- Our what?
- Your aunt.
My name is Ingrid.
Your mother and I were sisters.
You look exactly like her.
[Sighs]
But our mother doesn't have a sister.
At least, she never told us about one.
I'm sure it was too painful for her to talk about.
You see, many years ago,
I was trapped in a magical urn by...
People who didn't exactly understand me.
Didn't understand you?
[Whoosh]
Our gift runs in the family.
Anna:
I'm telling you, that woman is up to something.
What, you mean your aunt?
What makes you think that?
'Cause it's weird and strange, her being here.
And because I'm a good judge of character.
Yeah, says the girl who agreed to marry Hans 10 minutes after you started talking to him.
I was young and naive.
You met me the next day.
Young-er.
Anyway, I just want to make sure we're asking all the right questions.
- Like what?
- Like, is she really even my aunt, or is she just some imposter trying to worm her way into our family?
Anna, look at her.
You can't see the resemblance?
Oh, yes, the ice-power thing, there's that.
Maybe, but if she's really my aunt, why isn't she in the family portraits, the royal records?
There's no trace of her.
It's like she never even existed.
There has to be an explanation for all this.
Yeah?
And how do you think you're gonna find it?
Your family.
Careful.
Grand Pabbie's still a little miffed that you postponed the wedding.
I can handle grand Pabbie.
Will you go back to the castle and cover for me... watch Elsa while I'm gone?
If it'll put your mind at ease, of course.
Oh, but, Kristoff, you have to be careful what you say around her.
I...
Might not...
I might not exactly have told her what I discovered in the enchanted forest.
You lied to her?
Ohh, I didn't lie.
I just... withheld the truth.
Telling her our parents wanted to take away her magic...
I just have to find the right moment.
That's all.
Right, right.
Of course.
Yeah.
You know I'll support you no matter what.
Unless I think it's really dumb.
Then I'll tell you.
Thank goodness I haven't hit "really dumb" yet.
Can I get you supplies for your journey?
You're sweet, but no.
I'll stop by oaken's on the way.
You'll see me as soon as I return.
Emma:
David, call off the search party.
We found the truck near the merry men's camp.
Thanks for keeping an eye out.
Gladly.
You're the first sheriff I don't mind assisting.
Uh, Regina, I was hoping we could talk.
Um, in case you haven't noticed,
I'm about to storm an evil ice-cream truck.
You could have just said, "maybe later."
I know you're trying to make everything better, but staying out of it is your best bet.
It's bad enough I'm stuck with you and captain guy-liner making eyes at each other.
I don't make eyes.
Ready, love?
[Sighs]
It appears she beat us to it.
She's cleared out the vessel.
What now?
Should we question the cows she gets her milk from?
Maybe search the waffle-cone factory?
Hang on.
Look.
Who locks their freezer?
Was she afraid someone was gonna steal the Rocky road?
Stand back.
Looks like the dairy Queen's been following me for a long time.
Since before foster care?
Since I landed in this world.
Belle:
Are you okay?
This is pointless.
I don't know why I thought
I'd find anything about Anna in here.
You know she's somewhere.
You know she's alive.
You heard her heartbeat with Bo-peep's staff, right?
But if what the Snow Queen told me is true and Anna is the one who put me in that urn, then maybe she doesn't want me to find her.
That's not true, Elsa.
You're just saying that to make me feel better.
No, I promise you, I'm not.
How would you know what my sister thinks?
You've never even met her.
Well, just from what you've been saying,
I-I feel like I know her.
You two were very close.
Something must have pulled you apart... something beyond your control.
[Voice breaking] But my memories are gone, and no one in this town has even been to Arendelle.
I need to face the truth, Belle.
No one here can help me, and I'm afraid that means I might never see Anna again.
[Sighs] Okay.
You will.
[Scoffs]
I know it.
Now, keep looking.
I'll be back.
What?
Where are you going?
There's something I-I need to take care of.
We will find Anna.
You want to find trolls?
You know they're dangerous, yeah?
Oh, no, no, no.
Rock trolls, not bridge trolls.
Oh, yeah, they're quite nice.
So, you can... you can direct me to them?
No.
I've never met them.
Yoo-hoo!
But y-you just said they were nice.
I've heard.
[Sighs]
Please help me.
I-I just lost my mother.
Oh, I'm...
I'm so sorry.
Uh, trolls can't bring life.
But I can help soothe you.
Have you tried the sauna?
Uh, no, no.
Thank you.
Anna:
Need some help?
Uh, well, I was trying to find my way to the rock trolls, but this map is not being too helpful.
Oaken means well.
- Yeah!
- But you don't need him or a map.
I can help you.
I'm on my way to see them.
Come with me.
Really?
[Laughing] Thank you.
Uh, I'm Belle.
I'm Anna.
Friend of Anna's?
Half price on the sauna.
- [Sighs]
- I can't help but think
- you're avoiding me.
- [Sighs]
Well, not very well, it seems.
You're upset because of what I said... that I'm still in love with you.
I suppose I should never have told you, not after I asked you to find a way to save my wife.
That's not why I'm avoiding you.
Then why can't you even look me in the eye?
Because I don't know how to tell you the truth.
You know you can tell me anything.
I've read every spell book in my possession, experimented with every potion in my vault.
I even tried to defeat the Snow Queen so I could force her to reverse the spell.
But...
Nothing I do seems good enough.
But it will be, Regina.
I have faith in you.
You will figure out a way eventually.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm not sure I can figure it out.
Robin, I'm sorry, but if you truly want to save Marian...
You're gonna have to forget about me...
And...
Find a way...
To fall in love with your wife again.
You can show yourself, dearie.
I'm not the one you're hiding from.
No, you're not.
To what do I owe this intrusion?
A warning.
Emma Swan is onto you.
She knows your history began long before you came to Storybrooke.
I'm aware.
Do you really think she would have discovered that if I hadn't wanted her to?
It's all part of my plan... a plan you thankfully know little about.
You're being awfully secretive.
You didn't come to warn me.
You came to find out my secrets.
Or offer up a deal.
Whatever suits you best.
But if you decline, I'd be careful.
There it is.
There's the warning.
You want something out of me?
Why don't you just ask for it?
If I wanted something out of you, dearie, believe me, I'd take it.
But you can't, can you?
Otherwise you would.
You and I both know...
to get what you want, you need one thing that I have and you're sorely lacking... leverage.
And until you get that...
I have a warning for you.
Stay out of my way.
[Breathing heavily]
Don't worry, Anna.
I'll find you.
So, Belle...
I couldn't help overhearing...
Well, actually, I could, but I'm naturally curious.
Anyway...
I heard you lost your mother.
Yes, in the... in the ogres war.
I'm so sorry.
I lost mine, too.
There are no words.
[Sighs] No, there aren't, especially when you don't know what happened.
I was hoping the rock trolls could restore my memory so that I can finally be at peace.
Sometimes the answer isn't what you want.
Which is what?
One that makes you feel better.
But if grand Pabbie can help you get what you need,
I'll make sure he does.
Thank you.
Uh...
So, now what?
Now we climb.
Okay.
[Grunts]
[Laughs]
Belle:
Okay.
- [Screams] - [Gasps]
You okay?
- Ohh.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Whoo!
Oh!
Kristoff makes this look easy!
[Sighs]
Here.
Careful!
Careful.
Why?
W-what's inside?
A hat which can strip the magic from the most powerful of sorcerers.
Why do you have such a thing?
I sort of stole it from an evil sorcerer when I was back in the enchanted forest.
[Sighs] I went to him to help with my sister, but things didn't exactly go according to plan.
Why?
What... what happened?
Who... who is this person?
I-I'd really rather not get into it.
The less you know, the better.
I just pray you never cross paths with that twisted man.
[Door bells jingle]
Belle.
[Door closes] Where are you headed?
To the north woods, where the Snow Queen's hiding.
And what business do you have with her?
I have to fix a mistake that I made a long time ago.
What are you talking about?
I'm afraid I can't tell you.
You wouldn't understand.
Whether or not that's true, the fact remains that she defeated both Emma and Regina.
She is far more dangerous than you realize.
I know.
That's why I was...
I was hoping you'd come with me.
[Scoffs] I'm sorry, Belle.
That's out of the question.
I won't let you anywhere near her.
I was worried you were gonna say that.
Because...
I really...
Really didn't want to do this.
Bell, I gave you that dagger because I trusted you... because I thought you would never want to control me.
I know.
I know, and I'm so, so sorry, Rumple.
But if you won't come with me willingly, what choice do I have?
Take me to the Snow Queen.
Emma:
According to this, she was my foster parent for six months.
Aye?
That's the longest I was ever in one spot, but I don't remember a second of it.
You all right, Swan?
I'm fine.
It was all a long time ago.
Mm, perhaps, but wounds that are made when we're young
- tend to linger.
- How would you know?
Believe it or not, I was once a child.
Yeah, like a million years ago.
It was more like 200.
What is it?
It's a painting I did when I was in school.
That so surprising?
It's not the only one.
This crazy woman has a whole file of my old art projects and essays.
Just like the one I have for Henry.
You don't keep stuff like this unless you care about someone.
Well, perhaps the Snow Queen wasn't simply using you.
Perhaps she'd grown fond of you over time.
Looks like the feeling was mutual.
"Thanks for being the family I never had."
"Love, Emma."
I wrote that to her.
Looks like you two were close once.
But she still erased my memories.
Something must have happened to change all that.
There has to be a clue as to why.
Perhaps there is...
If you can read hieroglyphs.
This isn't from our world.
What the hell was she doing with me?
This is it?
This is where she's hiding?
Indeed.
But she's not at home.
I don't sense her magic.
Good.
Okay.
You stay here as lookout.
I'm going in.
No, Belle, y-you're not going in there alone.
Look, I won't be long.
I just need to find something.
What could you possibly want from the Snow Queen's cave?
A hat... one that can strip a magical being of their powers.
That sounds like a remarkable object... almost too good to be true, which means it probably is.
It isn't, and I know she has it, and I need to get it from her.
It's the only way to force her to tell us where Anna is.
So this is about Elsa's sister?
Why are you so invested in a girl you've never even met?
Because a hero always helps strangers.
Now keep watch.
I'll call out to you if I need your help.
Grand Pabbie?
Grand Pabbie, it's me!
Ooh, Anna, my dear, you're back!
Have you come to tell us the new wedding date?
I have been working on my speech.
Not yet, but we can get into that later.
First, I want you to meet my friend Belle.
She's come a long way to see you.
It's an honor to meet you.
I'm, uh...
I'm here because I-I...
I know.
I can help you get the memories of your mother.
[Whoosh]
Take this to the place where you lost your memory, then brew a tea with the stone in the kettle.
When you drink it, your memories will return.
Thank you.
[Sighs]
Thank you, Anna.
I-I owe you, as well.
- How can I repay you?
- You don't have to.
Having a new friend is payment enough.
All I need is a moment alone with Pabbie.
I'll be quick.
What can I help you with, dear?
Some woman claims to be my aunt.
[Sighs] I just don't believe her!
Mother would have told us if she had a sister.
Actually, she had two sisters.
Wait.
What?
Mother had two sisters that she never spoke about?
Why didn't she say anything?
Why didn't you say anything?
Because I was sworn to secrecy.
Grand Pabbie, I need some answers.
Please.
[Sighs]
Your mother, Gerda, was the youngest of three.
And then there was Helga, and Ingrid was the oldest.
As children, the three girls were quite close, often seen playing together in the royal gardens.
But then, one day, Helga and Ingrid vanished.
No one ever knew what happened to them.
It was a tragedy the royal family wanted to forget.
And they did, with my help.
You took the memories of everyone in Arendelle?
Yes.
And the royal family erased mention of Helga and Ingrid from every book and record they could find in our realm.
Why wouldn't Ingrid tell me what happened, or that she had another sister?
Those are questions you'd have to ask your aunt.
[Sighs] Like she would tell me.
If she's keeping these secrets, who knows what else she's hiding.
I have to warn Elsa.
Belle, we have to go!
What?
Is everything okay?
I don't think so.
It's my aunt.
She's up to something.
The hat must be in here somewhere.
Woman: [Echoing] Belle.
Belle.
Belle!
Over here, Belle.
Over here, Belle.
Over...
Here.
Hello, Belle!
[Gasps]
I was hoping you'd find me.
I wish I didn't have to wait to use this.
You'll be home before you know it.
As soon as we get to town, we'll put you on the first ship back to the enchanted forest.
[Wind blows, thunder rumbles]
If any ships are even setting sail.
It...
Looks like a storm's setting in.
I don't think it's a storm.
Well, what else could it be?
My aunt.
I don't think my aunt wants me to tell my sister what I found out.
Well, if she... has all this magic and...
And you have, well, g-good intentions, then what are we gonna do?
I have more than good intentions!
I have this!
She can't hurt us if she doesn't have magic.
[Wind gusts]
[Screams]
[Grunts]
Belle!
Belle!
I can't pull myself up!
Just hold on!
I'll be right there!
Belle, hurry!
Please!
Oh!
[Gasps]
Belle, hurry!
I'm coming!
I'm coming.
[Grunts]
- [Screams]
- Anna!
Leave her alone!
You'll have to excuse us, but this is family business.
Mirror Belle:
I'm surprised you were brave enough to come in here.
I had to.
I have to find a way to help Anna.
Why?
[Scoffs]
You never really cared much for her before.
That's not true.
Sure, it is.
You chose that rock over her.
You had to remember what happened to your mother, no matter what the cost.
I made a mistake.
I didn't mean to...
Ruin someone's life?
[Scoffs]
It certainly wasn't your most heroic moment.
Not that you've ever really been hero material.
No, please... please stop.
Everyone sees you for what you really are, Belle... a pathetic coward.
I mean, why do you think the dark one married you?
You think it was love?
He needed someone weak, someone he could manipulate.
That's not true.
He loves me.
He gave me this.
[Laughs]
You truly believe that's real?
Deep down, you know what kind of beast you're dealing with.
Belle!
Belle.
The Snow Queen's approaching the cave.
- Belle.
- [Gasps]
Look at me.
Don't look in the mirror.
Look at me.
We have to leave.
- [Grunting]
- Let me go!
- You don't know what you're doing.
- No!
- Please, let me go!
- It's okay.
- Let...
let me go!
- It's okay.
We're back in the shop.
- We're back in the shop.
It's okay.
- No, no!
- It's okay.
- Wait.
No.
You were outside the cave.
I commanded that you wait there.
You commanded me to keep watch.
I sensed she was coming back.
I came to find you, and I'm glad I did.
[Knife clatters]
[Voice breaking] I...
I hurt you.
I...
I'm so sorry, Rumple.
It's okay.
When I f-found that mirror, something came over me, like a...
like a spell.
And... and it spoke to me and made me... made me believe all these horrible things, and it said to me that the dagger you gave me is fake.
[Sniffles]
I can assure you that nothing that mirror said is true.
It was imbued with the darkest of magic.
I-I know you would never wrong me.
I have wronged you.
I've kept a terrible secret from you.
I'm the reason... that Anna's missing.
I didn't want anyone to know until I could make things right and save Anna.
But I couldn't.
I failed.
And all I managed to do was abuse the dagger and... and take advantage of you, my true love.
I-I don't even know if I... if I deserve to be with you anymore.
No, no, no.
You were only doing what you thought was right.
You... you forgive me?
Of course I forgive you.
[Crying]
Thank you for telling me everything.
Thank you for understanding.
I never should have kept a secret from you, especially 'cause I know that you'd never keep one from me.
I love you, Rumple.
And I love you, too.
[Sighs]
Father, I... [clears throat]
I-I thought you'd be asleep.
I haven't slept in days.
How could I when you left without so much as a goodbye?
So, did you find what you were looking for?
No.
You were right, father.
I should have just left things alone.
That trip was a huge mistake.
I'm the one who's made the mistake, Belle.
I've been keeping a secret from you.
I know what happened during the ogre attack.
Wait, what?
!
I didn't want to add to your grief.
When the ogres stormed the library where you and your mother had been working, the guards heard the commotion.
They rushed in.
They saw the ogres were about to attack.
But your mother, she... she stood in the path of those monsters to protect you.
She kept them at bay while the guards pulled you from danger.
But by the time they came to save your mother...
It was too late.
She sacrificed herself for me.
She loved you so much, and so do I.
I'm so glad you're back.
I don't know what I would have done if the ogres had gotten you on the road.
They... they have reached the roads?
The war is not going well.
But you need not worry of such things.
We have soldiers to fight.
But those soldiers don't stand a chance.
They'll only slow down the ogres' advance.
[Sighs]
We need someone who can stop them once and for all.
And who would that be?
On my journey, I did some reading.
And, well...
There's a wizard, a powerful, powerful wizard, who may just help us.
- His name is...
- I know his name!
And I dare not speak it.
Trust me, Belle, if we do...
I know.
Magic always comes with a price.
[Sighs]
But if mother's death taught me anything, it's that sometimes a hero has to sacrifice everything to save the people they love, and I will do whatever I can to save our land.
And I can be a hero, just like mother.
And if that means summoning Rumplestiltskin...
Then so be it.
I'm afraid we have a problem, dearie.
I caught a glimpse of your mirror today.
It's rather impressive, isn't it?
I had no idea your bride would be so easy to turn.
Watch yourself.
Now, I don't know exactly when you intend to use this mirror, but you should know this.
I won't allow you to hurt those I care about.
And I won't allow you to derail my plans because you've suddenly gotten sentimental.
You only get one warning.
Which is more than you get.
I can't make any promises over who may or who may not survive.
You know, you were wrong before.
That you needed leverage to get what you want?
No, that I didn't have it.
I do.
Where did you get that?
Oh, that's irrelevant.
But now that I know what you're up to, we can have a real talk.
You might want to reconsider your position, because I doubt you'd enjoy becoming just another embroidery on this hat.
Looks like you've just lost your leverage, dearie.
Anna.
It's time to wake up, dear.
What?
Where am I?
Exactly where you belong.
[Bars clatter]
You can't just lock me in here!
Elsa won't stand for it!
Even when she finds out what you were planning to do to her?
Wait.
What?
You were planning to use this to strip away her magic.
No, that's not why I had it.
Really?
Then why didn't you tell Elsa about it?
Because I-I didn't know how to tell her the truth.
I found it with a man that our parents sought out.
They went to him looking for a way to strip Elsa of the thing that makes her special.
And you're following in their footsteps.
I wasn't going to use it on her.
I wasn't going to use it on anybody...
Until you attacked me.
The rock trolls told me what you've been hiding, that you and my mother had another sister.
The rock trolls shouldn't talk about things that they don't understand.
But it's true.
What happened to her?
Some secrets are better left buried.
I don't understand.
What do you want?
!
What I have always wanted... a family who will embrace me for who I am.
For a brief moment,
I thought the three of us could be that family... you, me, and Elsa.
But you showed me that plan would never work.
You have nothing in common with Elsa and me.
You are the odd woman out.
And now I suppose I have to find someone else to take your place.
The Snow Queen is your aunt?
According to this heraldry book I found in the library.
Her name is Ingrid.
I didn't even know my mother had any sisters.
I'm as surprised as you are.
Well, spend a little more time in this town, love, you'll realize just about everyone's related.
This book traces the lineage in Arendelle for generations.
That's gerda, my mother.
And this is Helga, my other aunt.
Bloody hell.
Look at this one...
she looks just like you.
Maybe that's why she was so obsessed with you, why she kept all those relics from your childhood.
She came to this world looking for blondes?
There's a lot more than just me.
Don't I know it.
[Sighs] She wasn't looking for a blonde.
She was looking for the savior.
What?
This scroll... the writing is runic.
It's a prophecy.
It says, "the name of the savior is Emma."
She knew?
Before you even did.
She knew you were powerful.
But why?
It says it right here...
"And the savior shall become Ingrid's sister."
What the hell does that mean?
Well, my mother died, and her other sister... she's not around anymore.
I think Ingrid believes in this prophecy.
[Door opens] I think she's looking to replace them.
[Footsteps approach] Belle:
Elsa.
[Sighs]
Yes.
I...
I'm sorry.
I am so, so sorry, but...
What?
I-I've been keeping a secret.
I know your sister, Anna.
She helped me once.
But when I had a chance to help her, I let her down.
And because I did, she was captured by the Snow Queen.
What?
Where did this happen?
When?
Arendelle... a long, long time ago.
And I have no idea where she is now.
But, uh, I'm afraid we have a more pressing concern.
The Snow Queen has a mirror imbued with terrible magic that can do terrible things.
Mirror?
Easy enough, let's just go smash it.
It's not that simple.
Rumple told me it's part of an awful spell... the spell of shattered sight.
If she casts it, its magic will make everyone in Storybrooke turn on one another.
Bloody hell.
The entire town will destroy itself.
And there'd be no one left.
Except us.
What makes you think that she'd spare you and Elsa?
[Sighing] Because of this.
She wants it to be just the three of us.
Her perfect family.
Previously on Once Upon A Time...
- Marian!
- So, how do we break the spell?
- True love's kiss.
- There's a reason that kiss didn't work.
I'm in love with someone else.
She's still your wife.
Soon I will have what I want.
A family that loves me.
The wall... it's fallen.
We must leave now.
The town will soon be overrun.
These books are too valuable to leave to those monsters.
- My Lady, please.
- Take these trunks to the carriage.
I'll be just behind you.
- And your daughter?
- I will find her.
Now go.
Darling, we must leave, quickly!
Where are you?
I'm right here, mother!
I'm sorry, but I couldn't leave without this.
It's the first story you ever read to me, remember?
It's what made me fall in love with books.
Of course I remember, my Belle.
Quickly, we must flee befo...
They're here.
We will hide till they pass.
Ogres!
Shh!
It's going to be all right.
Mother?
!
M...
Belle, why aren't you in bed?
What happened?
W-where's mother?
You mean... you don't remember?
Remember what, father?
I...
No.
Rumple?
- Belle.
- Hey, I've been...
Been looking all over the house for you.
Didn't even hear you leave.
Well, I didn't want to wake you.
Just a few things to take care of before we open.
Well, whatever it is, it'll have to wait.
Emma called.
She needs to see us right away.
Give it back, Kevin.
The camera is Emma's, not yours.
Emma, that's you.
You must be... 13, maybe 14.
Are you missing the part where she's with the Snow Queen?
Emma, you knew her before you came to Storybrooke?
Apparently my run-in with her in town wasn't the only memory she erased.
All this time in this foster home, or whatever that place was... it's gone.
Look, I-I just don't understand how she even ended up in this world.
We were hoping Gold could tell us that.
You spent more time trying to get here than anyone.
How the hell did she do it?
Considering the time I spent on the same task,
I'd love to know.
Does it really matter how she got to Emma?
I mean, shouldn't we be more concerned about why?
Obviously, she needed her for something.
But what?
Well, that's our next problem.
Well, we know she's hiding somewhere in the north woods.
We combed every inch of her shop.
We tore apart her house.
She must have cleared everything out days before.
Which means she must be hiding something.
But where?
What about her ice-cream truck?
Whoa, Snow Queen has an ice-cream truck?
I'm a kid.
I notice these kind of things.
Then we split up into groups.
We search the town, the woods.
Hook, Regina, Emma, you take the west.
Gold, you're with me for the east.
I think we all know I work best alone.
Well, no time to argue that.
Belle, how are you at tracking?
Uh, actually, I-I think I'll be more helpful at the library.
Maybe I can dig something up on the Snow Queen.
I'd like to come with you, Belle, if that's okay.
Maybe something about my sister will be there, too.
Unless you'd rather not have the company?
No, n-not at all.
I would love some.
It's late.
You should be in bed.
How can I possibly sleep when I can't even remember what happened to mother?
- Perhaps that's for the best.
- No!
I need to know what happened to her after I blacked out.
You won't find the answers you seek in the pages of a book.
But I already have, father.
According to this, there are creatures who can restore memories that have been lost.
If we journey to them, maybe they can help me remember what happened to mother.
I can't allow you to do that.
Why not?
Because there's something this book doesn't tell you.
Magic always comes with a price.
And whatever that price is,
I don't want you to have to pay it.
I'm sorry, Belle, but I've already lost your mother to this infernal ogres war.
I can't lose you, too.
- But father...
- You heard me!
No, no!
Forget this nonsense!
You are not to leave this chamber until the doctors say you're better!
I'm sorry, father, but I need to know what happened.
And this...
Is the only place where I'll find the answer.
Arendelle.
There doesn't seem to be anything on Arendelle here.
Do you know where to look?
No, I'm...
I'm sorry.
I'm...
I'm really not that familiar with Arendelle, o-or... or your sister.
Elsa?
Anna!
Oh!
Oh, I was worried I'd never see you again.
I'm afraid you're stuck with me.
I'm sorry I left without telling you.
Oh, and I'm sorry I made you feel like you had to.
I know you did it for me, to try to make me feel better.
So, what did you learn?
Did you discover why our parents went to the enchanted forest?
What is it, Anna?
What did you find?
Nothing.
I mean, I'm still waiting on some answers from a few people I met, but I wouldn't expect anything anytime soon because they have to find it out, then get on a ship and come here.
It could take a while, a long while, and...
Wait, no flurries?
No frost on the windows?
Usually a conversation about our parents ends with a chill in the air.
I've been learning to control my powers when I get upset.
Really?
How?
By training with me.
Who is that?
I mean, who are you?
I-I mean...
Hi.
She's our aunt.
- Our what?
- Your aunt.
My name is Ingrid.
Your mother and I were sisters.
You look exactly like her.
But our mother doesn't have a sister.
At least, she never told us about one.
I'm sure it was too painful for her to talk about.
You see, many years ago,
I was trapped in a magical urn by...
People who didn't exactly understand me.
Didn't understand you?
Our gift runs in the family.
I'm telling you, that woman is up to something.
What, you mean your aunt?
What makes you think that?
'Cause it's weird and strange, her being here.
And because I'm a good judge of character.
Yeah, says the girl who agreed to marry Hans 10 minutes after you started talking to him.
I was young and naive.
You met me the next day.
Young-er.
Anyway, I just want to make sure we're asking all the right questions.
- Like what?
- Like, is she really even my aunt, or is she just some imposter trying to worm her way into our family?
Anna, look at her.
You can't see the resemblance?
Oh, yes, the ice-power thing, there's that.
Maybe, but if she's really my aunt, why isn't she in the family portraits, the royal records?
There's no trace of her.
It's like she never even existed.
There has to be an explanation for all this.
Yeah?
And how do you think you're gonna find it?
Your family.
Careful.
Grand Pabbie's still a little miffed that you postponed the wedding.
I can handle grand Pabbie.
Will you go back to the castle and cover for me... watch Elsa while I'm gone?
If it'll put your mind at ease, of course.
Oh, but, Kristoff, you have to be careful what you say around her.
I...
Might not...
I might not exactly have told her what I discovered in the enchanted forest.
You lied to her?
Ohh, I didn't lie.
I just... withheld the truth.
Telling her our parents wanted to take away her magic...
I just have to find the right moment.
That's all.
Right, right.
Of course.
Yeah.
You know I'll support you no matter what.
Unless I think it's really dumb.
Then I'll tell you.
Thank goodness I haven't hit "really dumb" yet.
Can I get you supplies for your journey?
You're sweet, but no.
I'll stop by oaken's on the way.
You'll see me as soon as I return.
David, call off the search party.
We found the truck near the merry men's camp.
Thanks for keeping an eye out.
Gladly.
You're the first sheriff I don't mind assisting.
Uh, Regina, I was hoping we could talk.
Um, in case you haven't noticed,
I'm about to storm an evil ice-cream truck.
You could have just said, "maybe later."
I know you're trying to make everything better, but staying out of it is your best bet.
It's bad enough I'm stuck with you and captain guy-liner making eyes at each other.
I don't make eyes.
Ready, love?
It appears she beat us to it.
She's cleared out the vessel.
What now?
Should we question the cows she gets her milk from?
Maybe search the waffle-cone factory?
Hang on.
Look.
Who locks their freezer?
Was she afraid someone was gonna steal the Rocky road?
Stand back.
Looks like the dairy Queen's been following me for a long time.
Since before foster care?
Since I landed in this world.
Are you okay?
This is pointless.
I don't know why I thought
I'd find anything about Anna in here.
You know she's somewhere.
You know she's alive.
You heard her heartbeat with Bo-peep's staff, right?
But if what the Snow Queen told me is true and Anna is the one who put me in that urn, then maybe she doesn't want me to find her.
That's not true, Elsa.
You're just saying that to make me feel better.
No, I promise you, I'm not.
How would you know what my sister thinks?
You've never even met her.
Well, just from what you've been saying,
I-I feel like I know her.
You two were very close.
Something must have pulled you apart... something beyond your control.
But my memories are gone, and no one in this town has even been to Arendelle.
I need to face the truth, Belle.
No one here can help me, and I'm afraid that means I might never see Anna again.
Okay.
You will.
I know it.
Now, keep looking.
I'll be back.
What?
Where are you going?
There's something I-I need to take care of.
We will find Anna.
You want to find trolls?
You know they're dangerous, yeah?
Oh, no, no, no.
Rock trolls, not bridge trolls.
Oh, yeah, they're quite nice.
So, you can... you can direct me to them?
No.
I've never met them.
Yoo-hoo!
But y-you just said they were nice.
I've heard.
Please help me.
I-I just lost my mother.
Oh, I'm...
I'm so sorry.
Uh, trolls can't bring life.
But I can help soothe you.
Have you tried the sauna?
Uh, no, no.
Thank you.
Need some help?
Uh, well, I was trying to find my way to the rock trolls, but this map is not being too helpful.
Oaken means well.
- Yeah!
- But you don't need him or a map.
I can help you.
I'm on my way to see them.
Come with me.
Really?
Thank you.
Uh, I'm Belle.
I'm Anna.
Friend of Anna's?
Half price on the sauna.
I can't help but think you're avoiding me.
Well, not very well, it seems.
You're upset because of what I said... that I'm still in love with you.
I suppose I should never have told you, not after I asked you to find a way to save my wife.
That's not why I'm avoiding you.
Then why can't you even look me in the eye?
Because I don't know how to tell you the truth.
You know you can tell me anything.
I've read every spell book in my possession, experimented with every potion in my vault.
I even tried to defeat the Snow Queen so I could force her to reverse the spell.
But...
Nothing I do seems good enough.
But it will be, Regina.
I have faith in you.
You will figure out a way eventually.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm not sure I can figure it out.
Robin, I'm sorry, but if you truly want to save Marian...
You're gonna have to forget about me...
And...
Find a way...
To fall in love with your wife again.
You can show yourself, dearie.
I'm not the one you're hiding from.
No, you're not.
To what do I owe this intrusion?
A warning.
Emma Swan is onto you.
She knows your history began long before you came to Storybrooke.
I'm aware.
Do you really think she would have discovered that if I hadn't wanted her to?
It's all part of my plan... a plan you thankfully know little about.
You're being awfully secretive.
You didn't come to warn me.
You came to find out my secrets.
Or offer up a deal.
Whatever suits you best.
But if you decline, I'd be careful.
There it is.
There's the warning.
You want something out of me?
Why don't you just ask for it?
If I wanted something out of you, dearie, believe me, I'd take it.
But you can't, can you?
Otherwise you would.
You and I both know...
to get what you want, you need one thing that I have and you're sorely lacking... leverage.
And until you get that...
I have a warning for you.
Stay out of my way.
Don't worry, Anna.
I'll find you.
So, Belle...
I couldn't help overhearing...
Well, actually, I could, but I'm naturally curious.
Anyway...
I heard you lost your mother.
Yes, in the... in the ogres war.
I'm so sorry.
I lost mine, too.
There are no words.
No, there aren't, especially when you don't know what happened.
I was hoping the rock trolls could restore my memory so that I can finally be at peace.
Sometimes the answer isn't what you want.
Which is what?
One that makes you feel better.
But if grand Pabbie can help you get what you need,
I'll make sure he does.
Thank you.
Uh...
So, now what?
Now we climb.
Okay.
Okay.
You okay?
- Ohh.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Whoo!
Oh!
Kristoff makes this look easy!
Here.
Careful!
Careful.
Why?
W-what's inside?
A hat which can strip the magic from the most powerful of sorcerers.
Why do you have such a thing?
I sort of stole it from an evil sorcerer when I was back in the enchanted forest.
I went to him to help with my sister, but things didn't exactly go according to plan.
Why?
What... what happened?
Who... who is this person?
I-I'd really rather not get into it.
The less you know, the better.
I just pray you never cross paths with that twisted man.
Belle.
Where are you headed?
To the north woods, where the Snow Queen's hiding.
And what business do you have with her?
I have to fix a mistake that I made a long time ago.
What are you talking about?
I'm afraid I can't tell you.
You wouldn't understand.
Whether or not that's true, the fact remains that she defeated both Emma and Regina.
She is far more dangerous than you realize.
I know.
That's why I was...
I was hoping you'd come with me.
I'm sorry, Belle.
That's out of the question.
I won't let you anywhere near her.
I was worried you were gonna say that.
Because...
I really...
Really didn't want to do this.
Bell, I gave you that dagger because I trusted you... because I thought you would never want to control me.
I know.
I know, and I'm so, so sorry, Rumple.
But if you won't come with me willingly, what choice do I have?
Take me to the Snow Queen.
According to this, she was my foster parent for six months.
Aye?
That's the longest I was ever in one spot, but I don't remember a second of it.
You all right, Swan?
I'm fine.
It was all a long time ago.
Mm, perhaps, but wounds that are made when we're young
- tend to linger.
- How would you know?
Believe it or not, I was once a child.
Yeah, like a million years ago.
It was more like 200.
What is it?
It's a painting I did when I was in school.
That so surprising?
It's not the only one.
This crazy woman has a whole file of my old art projects and essays.
Just like the one I have for Henry.
You don't keep stuff like this unless you care about someone.
Well, perhaps the Snow Queen wasn't simply using you.
Perhaps she'd grown fond of you over time.
Looks like the feeling was mutual.
"Thanks for being the family I never had."
"Love, Emma."
I wrote that to her.
Looks like you two were close once.
But she still erased my memories.
Something must have happened to change all that.
There has to be a clue as to why.
Perhaps there is...
If you can read hieroglyphs.
This isn't from our world.
What the hell was she doing with me?
This is it?
This is where she's hiding?
Indeed.
But she's not at home.
I don't sense her magic.
Good.
Okay.
You stay here as lookout.
I'm going in.
No, Belle, y-you're not going in there alone.
Look, I won't be long.
I just need to find something.
What could you possibly want from the Snow Queen's cave?
A hat... one that can strip a magical being of their powers.
That sounds like a remarkable object... almost too good to be true, which means it probably is.
It isn't, and I know she has it, and I need to get it from her.
It's the only way to force her to tell us where Anna is.
So this is about Elsa's sister?
Why are you so invested in a girl you've never even met?
Because a hero always helps strangers.
Now keep watch.
I'll call out to you if I need your help.
Grand Pabbie?
Grand Pabbie, it's me!
Ooh, Anna, my dear, you're back!
Have you come to tell us the new wedding date?
I have been working on my speech.
Not yet, but we can get into that later.
First, I want you to meet my friend Belle.
She's come a long way to see you.
It's an honor to meet you.
I'm, uh...
I'm here because I-I...
I know.
I can help you get the memories of your mother.
Take this to the place where you lost your memory, then brew a tea with the stone in the kettle.
When you drink it, your memories will return.
Thank you.
Thank you, Anna.
I-I owe you, as well.
- How can I repay you?
- You don't have to.
Having a new friend is payment enough.
All I need is a moment alone with Pabbie.
I'll be quick.
What can I help you with, dear?
Some woman claims to be my aunt.
I just don't believe her!
Mother would have told us if she had a sister.
Actually, she had two sisters.
Wait.
What?
Mother had two sisters that she never spoke about?
Why didn't she say anything?
Why didn't you say anything?
Because I was sworn to secrecy.
Grand Pabbie, I need some answers.
Please.
Your mother, Gerda, was the youngest of three.
And then there was Helga, and Ingrid was the oldest.
As children, the three girls were quite close, often seen playing together in the royal gardens.
But then, one day, Helga and Ingrid vanished.
No one ever knew what happened to them.
It was a tragedy the royal family wanted to forget.
And they did, with my help.
You took the memories of everyone in Arendelle?
Yes.
And the royal family erased mention of Helga and Ingrid from every book and record they could find in our realm.
Why wouldn't Ingrid tell me what happened, or that she had another sister?
Those are questions you'd have to ask your aunt.
Like she would tell me.
If she's keeping these secrets, who knows what else she's hiding.
I have to warn Elsa.
Belle, we have to go!
What?
Is everything okay?
I don't think so.
It's my aunt.
She's up to something.
The hat must be in here somewhere.
Belle.
Belle.
Belle!
Over here, Belle.
Over here, Belle.
Over...
Here.
Hello, Belle!
I was hoping you'd find me.
I wish I didn't have to wait to use this.
You'll be home before you know it.
As soon as we get to town, we'll put you on the first ship back to the enchanted forest.
If any ships are even setting sail.
It...
Looks like a storm's setting in.
I don't think it's a storm.
Well, what else could it be?
My aunt.
I don't think my aunt wants me to tell my sister what I found out.
Well, if she... has all this magic and...
And you have, well, g-good intentions, then what are we gonna do?
I have more than good intentions!
I have this!
She can't hurt us if she doesn't have magic.
Belle!
Belle!
I can't pull myself up!
Just hold on!
I'll be right there!
Belle, hurry!
Please!
Oh!
Belle, hurry!
I'm coming!
I'm coming.
Anna!
Leave her alone!
You'll have to excuse us, but this is family business.
I'm surprised you were brave enough to come in here.
I had to.
I have to find a way to help Anna.
Why?
You never really cared much for her before.
That's not true.
Sure, it is.
You chose that rock over her.
You had to remember what happened to your mother, no matter what the cost.
I made a mistake.
I didn't mean to...
Ruin someone's life?
It certainly wasn't your most heroic moment.
Not that you've ever really been hero material.
No, please... please stop.
Everyone sees you for what you really are, Belle... a pathetic coward.
I mean, why do you think the dark one married you?
You think it was love?
He needed someone weak, someone he could manipulate.
That's not true.
He loves me.
He gave me this.
You truly believe that's real?
Deep down, you know what kind of beast you're dealing with.
Belle!
Belle.
The Snow Queen's approaching the cave.
Belle.
Look at me.
Don't look in the mirror.
Look at me.
We have to leave.
Let me go!
- You don't know what you're doing.
- No!
- Please, let me go!
- It's okay.
- Let...
let me go!
- It's okay.
We're back in the shop.
- We're back in the shop.
It's okay.
- No, no!
- It's okay.
- Wait.
No.
You were outside the cave.
I commanded that you wait there.
You commanded me to keep watch.
I sensed she was coming back.
I came to find you, and I'm glad I did.
I...
I hurt you.
I...
I'm so sorry, Rumple.
It's okay.
When I f-found that mirror, something came over me, like a...
like a spell.
And... and it spoke to me and made me... made me believe all these horrible things, and it said to me that the dagger you gave me is fake.
I can assure you that nothing that mirror said is true.
It was imbued with the darkest of magic.
I-I know you would never wrong me.
I have wronged you.
I've kept a terrible secret from you.
I'm the reason... that Anna's missing.
I didn't want anyone to know until I could make things right and save Anna.
But I couldn't.
I failed.
And all I managed to do was abuse the dagger and... and take advantage of you, my true love.
I-I don't even know if I... if I deserve to be with you anymore.
No, no, no.
You were only doing what you thought was right.
You... you forgive me?
Of course I forgive you.
Thank you for telling me everything.
Thank you for understanding.
I never should have kept a secret from you, especially 'cause I know that you'd never keep one from me.
I love you, Rumple.
And I love you, too.
Father, I...
I-I thought you'd be asleep.
I haven't slept in days.
How could I when you left without so much as a goodbye?
So, did you find what you were looking for?
No.
You were right, father.
I should have just left things alone.
That trip was a huge mistake.
I'm the one who's made the mistake, Belle.
I've been keeping a secret from you.
I know what happened during the ogre attack.
Wait, what?
!
I didn't want to add to your grief.
When the ogres stormed the library where you and your mother had been working, the guards heard the commotion.
They rushed in.
They saw the ogres were about to attack.
But your mother, she... she stood in the path of those monsters to protect you.
She kept them at bay while the guards pulled you from danger.
But by the time they came to save your mother...
It was too late.
She sacrificed herself for me.
She loved you so much, and so do I.
I'm so glad you're back.
I don't know what I would have done if the ogres had gotten you on the road.
They... they have reached the roads?
The war is not going well.
But you need not worry of such things.
We have soldiers to fight.
But those soldiers don't stand a chance.
They'll only slow down the ogres' advance.
We need someone who can stop them once and for all.
And who would that be?
On my journey, I did some reading.
And, well...
There's a wizard, a powerful, powerful wizard, who may just help us.
- His name is...
- I know his name!
And I dare not speak it.
Trust me, Belle, if we do...
I know.
Magic always comes with a price.
But if mother's death taught me anything, it's that sometimes a hero has to sacrifice everything to save the people they love, and I will do whatever I can to save our land.
And I can be a hero, just like mother.
And if that means summoning Rumplestiltskin...
Then so be it.
I'm afraid we have a problem, dearie.
I caught a glimpse of your mirror today.
It's rather impressive, isn't it?
I had no idea your bride would be so easy to turn.
Watch yourself.
Now, I don't know exactly when you intend to use this mirror, but you should know this.
I won't allow you to hurt those I care about.
And I won't allow you to derail my plans because you've suddenly gotten sentimental.
You only get one warning.
Which is more than you get.
I can't make any promises over who may or who may not survive.
You know, you were wrong before.
That you needed leverage to get what you want?
No, that I didn't have it.
I do.
Where did you get that?
Oh, that's irrelevant.
But now that I know what you're up to, we can have a real talk.
You might want to reconsider your position, because I doubt you'd enjoy becoming just another embroidery on this hat.
Looks like you've just lost your leverage, dearie.
Anna.
It's time to wake up, dear.
What?
Where am I?
Exactly where you belong.
You can't just lock me in here!
Elsa won't stand for it!
Even when she finds out what you were planning to do to her?
Wait.
What?
You were planning to use this to strip away her magic.
No, that's not why I had it.
Really?
Then why didn't you tell Elsa about it?
Because I-I didn't know how to tell her the truth.
I found it with a man that our parents sought out.
They went to him looking for a way to strip Elsa of the thing that makes her special.
And you're following in their footsteps.
I wasn't going to use it on her.
I wasn't going to use it on anybody...
Until you attacked me.
The rock trolls told me what you've been hiding, that you and my mother had another sister.
The rock trolls shouldn't talk about things that they don't understand.
But it's true.
What happened to her?
Some secrets are better left buried.
I don't understand.
What do you want?
!
What I have always wanted... a family who will embrace me for who I am.
For a brief moment,
I thought the three of us could be that family... you, me, and Elsa.
But you showed me that plan would never work.
You have nothing in common with Elsa and me.
You are the odd woman out.
And now I suppose I have to find someone else to take your place.
The Snow Queen is your aunt?
According to this heraldry book I found in the library.
Her name is Ingrid.
I didn't even know my mother had any sisters.
I'm as surprised as you are.
Well, spend a little more time in this town, love, you'll realize just about everyone's related.
This book traces the lineage in Arendelle for generations.
That's gerda, my mother.
And this is Helga, my other aunt.
Bloody hell.
Look at this one...
she looks just like you.
Maybe that's why she was so obsessed with you, why she kept all those relics from your childhood.
She came to this world looking for blondes?
There's a lot more than just me.
Don't I know it.
She wasn't looking for a blonde.
She was looking for the savior.
What?
This scroll... the writing is runic.
It's a prophecy.
It says, "the name of the savior is Emma."
She knew?
Before you even did.
She knew you were powerful.
But why?
It says it right here...
"And the savior shall become Ingrid's sister."
What the hell does that mean?
Well, my mother died, and her other sister... she's not around anymore.
I think Ingrid believes in this prophecy.
I think she's looking to replace them.
Elsa.
Yes.
I...
I'm sorry.
I am so, so sorry, but...
What?
I-I've been keeping a secret.
I know your sister, Anna.
She helped me once.
But when I had a chance to help her, I let her down.
And because I did, she was captured by the Snow Queen.
What?
Where did this happen?
When?
Arendelle... a long, long time ago.
And I have no idea where she is now.
But, uh, I'm afraid we have a more pressing concern.
The Snow Queen has a mirror imbued with terrible magic that can do terrible things.
Mirror?
Easy enough, let's just go smash it.
It's not that simple.
Rumple told me it's part of an awful spell... the spell of shattered sight.
If she casts it, its magic will make everyone in Storybrooke turn on one another.
Bloody hell.
The entire town will destroy itself.
And there'd be no one left.
Except us.
What makes you think that she'd spare you and Elsa?
Because of this.
She wants it to be just the three of us.
Her perfect family.
Previously, on "Once Upon A Time"...
- Marion.
- So how do we break the spell?
Regina:
True love's kiss.
There's a reason that kiss didn't work.
I'm in love with someone else.
She's still your wife.
Soon I will have what I want.
A family that loves me.
The wall... it's fallen.
We must leave now.
The town will soon be overrun.
These books are too valuable to leave to those monsters.
My lady, please.
Take these trunks to the carriage.
I'll be just behind you.
And your daughter?
I will find her.
Now go.
Darling, we must leave, quickly!
Where are you?
Belle:
I'm right here, mother!
I'm sorry, but I couldn't leave without this.
It's the first story you ever read to me, remember?
It's what made me fall in love with books.
Of course I remember, my Belle.
Quickly, we must flee bef... [ rumbling ] [ gasps ]
[ gasps ] They're here.
We will hide till they pass.
[ rumbling ] [ both panting ]
[ thud ] [ both gasp ]
Ogres!
[ growling ]
[ gasps ] Shh!
It's going to be all right.
[ both scream ] [ roars ] [ gasps ] Mother?
!
M...
Belle, why aren't you in bed?
What happened?
W-where's mother?
You mean...
You don't remember?
Remember what, father?
I... [ gasps ] [ indistinct whispering ] [ exhales sharply ] No.
Once Upon A Time: "Family Business" Season 4 Episode 6
Original Airdate Nov. 02, 2014
Rumple?
Belle.
Hey, I've been... been looking all over the house for you.
Didn't even hear you leave.
I didn't want to wake you.
Just a few things to take care of before we open.
Well, whatever it is, it'll have to wait.
Emma called.
She needs to see us right away.
[ sighs ]
Give it back, Kevin.
The camera is Emma's, not yours.
[ click ]
Emma, that's you.
You must be... 13 maybe 14.
Are you missing the part where she's with the Snow Queen?
Emma, you knew her before you came to Storybrooke?
Apparently my run-in with her in town wasn't the only memory she erased.
All this time in this foster home,
Or whatever that place was...
it's gone.
Look, I-I just don't understand how she even ended up in this world.
We were hoping Gold could tell us that.
You spent more time trying to get here than anyone.
Considering the time I spent on the same task,
Does it really matter how she got to Emma?
I mean, shouldn't we be more concerned about why?
Obviously, she needed her for something.
But what?
[ scoffs ] Well, that's our next problem.
Well, we know she's hiding somewhere in the north woods.
We combed every inch of her shop.
We tore apart her house.
Which means she must be hiding something.
But where?
What about her ice-cream truck?
Whoa, Snow Queen has an ice-cream truck?
I'm a kid.
I notice these kind of things.
Then we split up into groups.
We search the town, the woods.
Hook, Regina, Emma, you take the west.
Gold, you're with me for the east.
I think we all know I work best alone.
Well, no time to argue that.
Belle, how are you at tracking?
Uh, actually, I-I think I'll be more helpful at the library.
Maybe I can dig something up on the Snow Queen.
I'd like to come with you, Belle, if that's okay.
Maybe something about my sister will be there, too.
Unless you'd rather not have the company?
No, n-not at all.
I would love some.
It's late.
You should be in bed.
How can I possibly sleep when I can't even remember what happened to mother?
Perhaps that's for the best.
I need to know what happened to her after I blacked out.
You won't find the answers you seek in the pages of a book.
But I already have, father.
According to this, there are creatures who can restore memories that have been lost.
If we journey to them, maybe they can help me remember what happened to mother.
I can't allow you to do that.
Why not?
Because there's something this book doesn't tell you.
Magic always comes with a price.
And whatever that price is,
I don't want you to have to pay it.
I'm sorry, Belle,
But I've already lost your mother to this infernal ogres war.
I can't lose you, too.
But father...
you heard me!
No, no!
Forget this nonsense!
You are not to leave this chamber until the doctors say you're better!
[ door closes ]
I'm sorry, father, but I need to know what happened.
And this...
Is the only place where I'll find the answer.
Arendelle.
There doesn't seem to be anything on Arendelle here.
Do you know where to look?
No, I'm...
I'm sorry.
I'm...
I'm really not that familiar with Arendelle,
O-or... or your sister.
Elsa?
Anna!
Oh!
Oh, I was worried I'd never see you again.
I'm afraid you're stuck with me.
I'm sorry I left without telling you.
Oh, and I'm sorry I made you feel like you had to.
I know you did it for me, to try to make me feel better.
[ sighs ]
So, what did you learn?
Did you discover why our parents went to the enchanted forest?
What is it, Anna?
What did you find?
Nothing.
I mean, I'm still waiting on some answers from a few people I met,
But I wouldn't expect anything anytime soon because they have to find it out,
It could take a while, a long while, and...
Wait, no flurries?
No frost on the windows?
Usually a conversation about our parents ends with a chill in the air.
I've been learning to control my powers when I get upset.
Really?
How?
By training with me.
Who is that?
I mean, who are you?
I-I mean...
Hi.
She's our aunt.
Our what?
Your aunt.
My name is Ingrid.
Your mother and I were sisters.
You look exactly like her.
But our mother doesn't have a sister.
At least, she never told us about one.
I'm sure it was too painful for her to talk about.
You see, many years ago,
I was trapped in a magical urn by...
People who didn't exactly understand me.
Didn't understand you?
[ whoosh ]
Our gift runs in the family.
Anna:
I'm telling you, that woman is up to something.
What, you mean your aunt?
What makes you think that?
'Cause it's weird and strange, her being here.
And because I'm a good judge of character.
Yeah, says the girl who agreed to marry Hans 10 minutes after you started talking to him.
I was young and naive.
You met me the next day.
Young-er.
Anyway, I just want to make sure we're asking all the right questions.
Like what?
Like, is she really even my aunt,
Or is she just some imposter trying to worm her way into our family?
Anna, look at her.
You can't see the resemblance?
Oh, yes, the ice-power thing, there's that.
Maybe, but if she's really my aunt,
Why isn't she in the family portraits,
The royal records?
There's no trace of her.
It's like she never even existed.
There has to be an explanation for all this.
Yeah?
And how do you think you're gonna find it?
Your family.
Grand pabbie's still a little miffed that you postponed the wedding.
I can handle grand pabbie.
Will you go back to the castle and cover for me...
Watch Elsa while I'm gone?
If it'll put your mind at ease, of course.
You have to be careful what you say around her.
I...
Might not...
I might not exactly have told her what I discovered in the enchanted forest.
You lied to her?
Ohh, I didn't lie.
I just...
Withheld the truth.
Telling her our parents wanted to take away her magic...
I just have to find the right moment.
That's all.
Right, right.
Of course.
Yeah.
You know I'll support you no matter what.
Unless I think it's really dumb.
Thank goodness I haven't hit "really dumb" yet.
Can I get you supplies for your journey?
You're sweet, but no.
I'll stop by oaken's on the way.
You'll see me as soon as I return.
Emma:
David, call off the search party.
We found the truck near the merry men's camp.
Thanks for keeping an eye out.
You're the first sheriff I don't mind assisting.
Uh, Regina, I was hoping we could talk.
Um, in case you haven't noticed,
I'm about to storm an evil ice-cream truck.
You could have just said, "maybe later."
I know you're trying to make everything better,
But staying out of it is your best bet.
It's bad enough I'm stuck with you and captain guy-liner making eyes at each other.
I don't make eyes.
Ready, love?
[ sighs ]
It appears she beat us to it.
She's cleared out the vessel.
Should we question the cows she gets her milk from?
Maybe search the waffle-cone factory?
Hang on.
Look.
Who locks their freezer?
Was she afraid someone was gonna steal the rocky road?
Stand back.
Looks like the dairy queen's been following me for a long time.
Since before foster care?
Since I landed in this world.
Belle:
Are you okay?
This is pointless.
I don't know why I thought
I'd find anything about Anna in here.
You know she's somewhere.
You know she's alive.
You heard her heartbeat with Bo-peep's staff, right?
But if what the Snow Queen told me is true and Anna is the one who put me in that urn,
Then maybe she doesn't want me to find her.
You're just saying that to make me feel better.
No, I promise you, I'm not.
How would you know what my sister thinks?
You've never even met her.
Well, just from what you've been saying,
I-I feel like I know her.
You two were very close.
Something must have pulled you apart...
Something beyond your control.
[ voice breaking ] But my memories are gone,
And no one in this town has even been to Arendelle.
I need to face the truth, Belle.
No one here can help me,
And I'm afraid that means I might never see Anna again.
[ sighs ] Okay.
You will.
[ scoffs ]
I know it.
Now, keep looking.
I'll be back.
What?
Where are you going?
There's something I-I need to take care of.
We will find Anna.
You want to find trolls?
You know they're dangerous, yeah?
Oh, no, no, no.
Rock trolls, not bridge trolls.
Oh, yeah, they're quite nice.
So, you can...
you can direct me to them?
No.
I've never met them.
But y-you just said they were nice.
I've heard.
[ sighs ]
Please help me.
I-I just lost my mother.
Oh, I'm...
I'm so sorry.
Uh, trolls can't bring life.
But I can help soothe you.
Have you tried the sauna?
Uh, no, no.
Thank you.
Anna:
Need some help?
Uh, well, I was trying to find my way to the rock trolls,
But this map is not being too helpful.
Oaken means well.
- Yeah!
- But you don't need him or a map.
I'm on my way to see them.
Come with me.
Really?
[ laughing ] Thank you.
Uh, I'm Belle.
I'm Anna.
Friend of Anna's?
Half price on the sauna.
I can't help but think you're avoiding me.
[ sighs ]
Well, not very well, it seems.
You're upset because of what I said...
That I'm still in love with you.
I suppose I should never have told you,
Not after I asked you to find a way to save my wife.
That's not why I'm avoiding you.
Then why can't you even look me in the eye?
Because I don't know how to tell you the truth.
You know you can tell me anything.
I've read every spell book in my possession,
Experimented with every potion in my vault.
I even tried to defeat the Snow Queen so I could force her to reverse the spell.
But...
Nothing I do seems good enough.
But it will be, Regina.
I have faith in you.
You will figure out a way eventually.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm not sure I can figure it out.
Robin, I'm sorry,
But if you truly want to save Marian...
You're gonna have to forget about me...
And...
Find a way...
To fall in love with your wife again.
You can show yourself, dearie.
I'm not the one you're hiding from.
No, you're not.
To what do I owe this intrusion?
A warning.
Emma Swan is onto you.
She knows your history began long before you came to Storybrooke.
I'm aware.
Do you really think she would have discovered that if I hadn't wanted her to?
It's all part of my plan...
A plan you thankfully know little about.
You're being awfully secretive.
You didn't come to warn me.
You came to find out my secrets.
Or offer up a deal.
Whatever suits you best.
But if you decline, I'd be careful.
There it is.
There's the warning.
You want something out of me?
Why don't you just ask for it?
If I wanted something out of you, dearie,
Believe me, I'd take it.
But you can't, can you?
Otherwise you would.
You and I both know...
to get what you want,
You need one thing that I have and you're sorely lacking...
Leverage.
And until you get that...
I have a warning for you.
Stay out of my way.
[ breathing heavily ]
Don't worry, Anna.
I'll find you.
So, Belle...
Well, actually, I could, but I'm naturally curious.
Anyway...
I heard you lost your mother.
Yes, in the...
in the ogres war.
I'm so sorry.
I lost mine, too.
There are no words.
[ sighs ] No, there aren't,
Especially when you don't know what happened.
I was hoping the rock trolls could restore my memory so that I can finally be at peace.
Sometimes the answer isn't what you want.
Which is what?
One that makes you feel better.
But if grand pabbie can help you get what you need,
I'll make sure he does.
Thank you.
Uh...
So, now what?
Now we climb.
Okay.
[ grunts ] [ laughs ]
Belle:
Okay.
[ screams ] [ gasps ]
You okay?
Ohh.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Whoo!
Oh!
Kristoff makes this look easy!
[ sighs ]
Here.
Careful!
Careful.
Why?
W-what's inside?
A hat which can strip the magic from the most powerful of sorcerers.
Why do you have such a thing?
I sort of stole it from an evil sorcerer when I was back in the enchanted forest.
[ sighs ] I went to him to help with my sister,
But things didn't exactly go according to plan.
Why?
What...
what happened?
Who...
who is this person?
I-I'd really rather not get into it.
The less you know, the better.
I just pray you never cross paths with that twisted man.
[ door bells jingle ] [ door closes ] Where are you headed?
To the north woods, where the Snow Queen's hiding.
And what business do you have with her?
I have to fix a mistake that I made a long time ago.
What are you talking about?
I'm afraid I can't tell you.
You wouldn't understand.
Whether or not that's true,
The fact remains that she defeated both Emma and Regina.
She is far more dangerous than you realize.
I know.
That's why I was...
I was hoping you'd come with me.
[ scoffs ] I'm sorry, Belle.
That's out of the question.
I won't let you anywhere near her.
I was worried you were gonna say that.
Because...
I really...
Really didn't want to do this.
Bell, I gave you that dagger because I trusted you...
Because I thought you would never want to control me.
I know.
I know, and I'm so, so sorry, Rumple.
But if you won't come with me willingly,
What choice do I have?
Take me to the Snow Queen.
She was my foster parent for six months.
Aye?
That's the longest I was ever in one spot,
But I don't remember a second of it.
I'm fine.
It was all a long time ago.
Mm, perhaps, but wounds that are made when we're young tend to linger.
How would you know?
Believe it or not, I was once a child.
Yeah, like a million years ago.
It was more like 200.
What is it?
It's a painting I did when I was in school.
That so surprising?
It's not the only one.
This crazy woman has a whole file of my old art projects and essays.
Just like the one I have for Henry.
You don't keep stuff like this unless you care about someone.
Well, perhaps the Snow Queen wasn't simply using you.
Perhaps she'd grown fond of you over time.
Looks like the feeling was mutual.
"Thanks for being the family I never had.
Love, Emma."
I wrote that to her.
Looks like you two were close once.
But she still erased my memories.
Something must have happened to change all that.
There has to be a clue as to why.
Perhaps there is...
If you can read hieroglyphs.
This isn't from our world.
What the hell was she doing with me?
This is it?
This is where she's hiding?
Indeed.
But she's not at home.
I don't sense her magic.
Good.
Okay.
You stay here as lookout.
I'm going in.
No, Belle, y-you're not going in there alone.
Look, I won't be long.
I just need to find something.
What could you possibly want from the Snow Queen's cave?
A hat...
One that can strip a magical being of their powers.
That sounds like a remarkable object...
Almost too good to be true, which means it probably is.
It isn't, and I know she has it,
And I need to get it from her.
It's the only way to force her to tell us where Anna is.
So this is about Elsa's sister?
Why are you so invested in a girl you've never even met?
Because a hero always helps strangers.
Now keep watch.
I'll call out to you if I need your help.
Grand pabbie?
Grand pabbie, it's me!
Ooh, Anna, my dear, you're back!
Have you come to tell us the new wedding date?
I have been working on my speech.
Not yet, but we can get into that later.
First, I want you to meet my friend Belle.
She's come a long way to see you.
It's an honor to meet you.
I'm, uh...
I'm here because I-I...
I know.
I can help you get the memories of your mother.
[ whoosh ]
Take this to the place where you lost your memory,
Then brew a tea with the stone in the kettle.
When you drink it, your memories will return.
Thank you.
[ sighs ]
Thank you, Anna.
I-I owe you, as well.
How can I repay you?
Having a new friend is payment enough.
All I need is a moment alone with pabbie.
I'll be quick.
What can I help you with, dear?
Some woman claims to be my aunt.
[ sighs ] I just don't believe her!
Mother would have told us if she had a sister.
Actually, she had two sisters.
Wait.
What?
Mother had two sisters that she never spoke about?
Why didn't she say anything?
Why didn't you say anything?
Because I was sworn to secrecy.
Grand pabbie, I need some answers.
Please.
[ sighs ]
Your mother, Gerda, was the youngest of three.
And then there was Helga, and Ingrid was the oldest.
As children, the three girls were quite close,
Often seen playing together in the royal gardens.
But then, one day, Helga and Ingrid vanished.
No one ever knew what happened to them.
It was a tragedy the royal family wanted to forget.
And they did, with my help.
- You took the memories of everyone in Arendelle?
- Yes.
And the royal family erased mention of Helga and Ingrid from every book and record they could find in our realm.
Why wouldn't Ingrid tell me what happened,
Or that she had another sister?
Those are questions you'd have to ask your aunt.
[ sighs ] Like she would tell me.
If she's keeping these secrets,
Who knows what else she's hiding.
I have to warn Elsa.
Belle, we have to go!
What?
Is everything okay?
I don't think so.
It's my aunt.
She's up to something.
The hat must be in here somewhere.
Woman:
[ echoing ] Belle.
Belle.
Belle!
Over here, Belle.
Over here, Belle.
Over...
Here.
Hello, Belle!
[ gasps ]
I was hoping you'd find me.
I wish I didn't have to wait to use this.
You'll be home before you know it.
We'll put you on the first ship back to the enchanted forest.
[ wind blows, thunder rumbles ]
If any ships are even setting sail.
It...
Looks like a storm's setting in.
I don't think it's a storm.
Well, what else could it be?
My aunt.
I don't think my aunt wants me to tell my sister what I found out.
Well, if she...
Has all this magic and...
And you have, well, g-good intentions,
Then what are we gonna do?
I have more than good intentions!
She can't hurt us if she doesn't have magic.
[ wind gusts ] [ screams ] [ grunts ]
Belle!
Belle!
I can't pull myself up!
Just hold on!
I'll be right there!
Belle, hurry!
Please!
Oh!
[ gasps ]
Belle, hurry!
I'm coming!
I'm coming.
[ grunts ] [ screams ] Anna!
Leave her alone!
You'll have to excuse us, but this is family business.
Mirror Belle:
I'm surprised you were brave enough to come in here.
I had to.
I have to find a way to help Anna.
Why?
[ scoffs ]
You never really cared much for her before.
That's not true.
Sure, it is.
You chose that rock over her.
You had to remember what happened to your mother,
No matter what the cost.
I made a mistake.
I didn't mean to...
Ruin someone's life?
[ scoffs ]
It certainly wasn't your most heroic moment.
Not that you've ever really been hero material.
No, please...
Please stop.
Everyone sees you for what you really are, Belle...
A pathetic coward.
I mean, why do you think the Dark One married you?
You think it was love?
He needed someone weak, someone he could manipulate.
That's not true.
He loves me.
He gave me this.
[ laughs ]
You truly believe that's real?
Deep down,
You know what kind of beast you're dealing with.
Belle!
Belle.
The Snow Queen's approaching the cave.
Belle.
[ gasps ]
Look at me.
Don't look in the mirror.
Look at me.
We have to leave.
[ grunting ]
Please, let me go!
It's okay.
Let...
let me go!
It's okay.
We're back in the shop.
- We're back in the shop.
It's okay.
- No, no!
It's okay.
Wait.
No.
You were outside the cave.
I commanded that you wait there.
You commanded me to keep watch.
I sensed she was coming back.
I came to find you, and I'm glad I did.
[ knife clatters ] [ voice breaking ] I...
I hurt you.
I...
I'm so sorry, Rumple.
It's okay.
When I f-found that mirror, something came over me,
Like a...
like a spell.
And... and it spoke to me and made me...
Made me believe all these horrible things,
And it said to me that the dagger you gave me is fake.
[ sniffles ]
I can assure you that nothing that mirror said is true.
It was imbued with the darkest of magic.
I-I know you would never wrong me.
I have wronged you.
I've kept a terrible secret from you.
I'm the reason...
That Anna's missing.
I didn't want anyone to know until I could make things right and save Anna.
But I couldn't.
I failed.
And all I managed to do was abuse the dagger and... and take advantage of you, my true love.
I-I don't even know if I...
If I deserve to be with you anymore.
No, no, no.
You were only doing what you thought was right.
You... you forgive me?
Of course I forgive you.
[ crying ]
Thank you for telling me everything.
Thank you for understanding.
I never should have kept a secret from you,
Especially 'cause I know that you'd never keep one from me.
I love you, Rumple.
And I love you, too.
[ sighs ]
Father, I...
[ clears throat ]
I-I thought you'd be asleep.
I haven't slept in days.
How could I when you left without so much as a goodbye?
So, did you find what you were looking for?
No.
You were right, father.
I should have just left things alone.
That trip was a huge mistake.
I'm the one who's made the mistake, Belle.
I've been keeping a secret from you.
I know what happened during the ogre attack.
Wait, what?
!
I didn't want to add to your grief.
When the ogres stormed the library where you and your mother had been working,
They rushed in.
They saw the ogres were about to attack.
She stood in the path of those monsters to protect you.
She kept them at bay while the guards pulled you from danger.
But by the time they came to save your mother...
It was too late.
She sacrificed herself for me.
She loved you so much, and so do I.
I'm so glad you're back.
I don't know what I would have done if the ogres had gotten you on the road.
They... they have reached the roads?
The war is not going well.
But you need not worry of such things.
We have soldiers to fight.
But those soldiers don't stand a chance.
They'll only slow down the ogres' advance.
We need someone who can stop them once and for all.
And who would that be?
On my journey, I did some reading.
And, well...
There's a wizard, a powerful, powerful wizard,
Who may just help us.
His name is...
I know his name!
And I dare not speak it.
Trust me, Belle, if we do...
I know.
Magic always comes with a price.
But if mother's death taught me anything,
It's that sometimes a hero has to sacrifice everything to save the people they love,
And I will do whatever I can to save our land.
And I can be a hero, just like mother.
And if that means summoning Rumplestiltskin...
Then so be it.
I'm afraid we have a problem, dearie.
I caught a glimpse of your mirror today.
It's rather impressive, isn't it?
I had no idea your bride would be so easy to turn.
Watch yourself.
Now, I don't know exactly when you intend to use this mirror,
But you should know this.
I won't allow you to hurt those I care about.
And I won't allow you to derail my plans because you've suddenly gotten sentimental.
You only get one warning.
Which is more than you get.
I can't make any promises over who may or who may not survive.
You know, you were wrong before.
That you needed leverage to get what you want?
No, that I didn't have it.
I do.
Where did you get that?
Oh, that's irrelevant.
But now that I know what you're up to,
We can have a real talk.
You might want to reconsider your position,
Because I doubt you'd enjoy becoming just another embroidery on this hat.
Looks like you've just lost your leverage, dearie.
Anna.
It's time to wake up, dear.
What?
Where am I?
Exactly where you belong.
[ bars clatter ]
You can't just lock me in here!
Elsa won't stand for it!
Even when she finds out what you were planning to do to her?
Wait.
What?
You were planning to use this to strip away her magic.
No, that's not why I had it.
Really?
Then why didn't you tell Elsa about it?
Because I-I didn't know how to tell her the truth.
I found it with a man that our parents sought out.
They went to him looking for a way to strip Elsa of the thing that makes her special.
And you're following in their footsteps.
I wasn't going to use it on her.
I wasn't going to use it on anybody...
Until you attacked me.
The rock trolls told me what you've been hiding,
That you and my mother had another sister.
The rock trolls shouldn't talk about things that they don't understand.
But it's true.
What happened to her?
Some secrets are better left buried.
I don't understand.
What do you want?
!
What I have always wanted...
A family who will embrace me for who I am.
For a brief moment,
I thought the three of us could be that family...
You, me, and Elsa.
But you showed me that plan would never work.
You have nothing in common with Elsa and me.
You are the odd woman out.
And now I suppose I have to find someone else to take your place.
The Snow Queen is your aunt?
According to this heraldry book I found in the library.
Her name is Ingrid.
I didn't even know my mother had any sisters.
Well, spend a little more time in this town, love,
You'll realize just about everyone's related.
This book traces the lineage in Arendelle for generations.
That's Gerda, my mother.
And this is Helga, my other aunt.
Bloody hell.
Look at this one...
she looks just like you.
Maybe that's why she was so obsessed with you,
Why she kept all those relics from your childhood.
She came to this world looking for blondes?
There's a lot more than just me.
Don't I know it.
[ sighs ] She wasn't looking for a blonde.
She was looking for the savior.
What?
This scroll...
the writing is runic.
It's a prophecy.
It says, "the name of the savior is Emma."
Before you even did.
She knew you were powerful.
But why?
It says it right here...
"and the savior shall become Ingrid's sister."
What the hell does that mean?
Well, my mother died, and her other sister...
She's not around anymore.
I think Ingrid believes in this prophecy.
[ door opens ] I think she's looking to replace them.
[ footsteps approach ] Belle:
Elsa.
[ sighs ]
Yes.
I...
I'm sorry.
I am so, so sorry, but...
I-I've been keeping a secret.
I know your sister, Anna.
She helped me once.
But when I had a chance to help her, I let her down.
And because I did,
She was captured by the Snow Queen.
What?
Where did this happen?
When?
Arendelle...
A long, long time ago.
And I have no idea where she is now.
But, uh, I'm afraid we have a more pressing concern.
The Snow Queen has a mirror imbued with terrible magic that can do terrible things.
Mirror?
Easy enough, let's just go smash it.
It's not that simple.
Rumple told me it's part of an awful spell...
The spell of shattered sight.
If she casts it,
Its magic will make everyone in Storybrooke turn on one another.
Bloody hell.
The entire town will destroy itself.
And there'd be no one left.
Except us.
What makes you think that she'd spare you and Elsa?
[ sighing ] Because of this.
She wants it to be just the three of us.
Her perfect family.
True love's kiss.
There's a reason that kiss didn't work.
I'm in love with someone else.
She's still your wife.
Soon I will have what I want.
A family that loves me.
The wall... it's fallen.
We must leave now.
The town will soon be overrun.
These books are too valuable to leave to those monsters.
My lady, please.
Take these trunks to the carriage.
I'll be just behind you.
And your daughter?
I will find her.
Now go.
Darling, we must leave, quickly!
Where are you?
I'm right here, mother!
I'm sorry, but I couldn't leave without this.
It's the first story you ever read to me, remember?
It's what made me fall in love with books.
Of course I remember, my belle.
Quickly, we must flee bef... they're here.
We will hide till they pass.
Ogres!
Shh!
It's going to be all right.
Mother?
!
M...
Belle, why aren't you in bed?
What happened?
W-where's mother?
You mean...
You don't remember?
Remember what, father?
I... no.
¶
¶
Rumple?
Belle.
Hey, I've been...
Been looking all over the house for you.
Didn't even hear you leave.
Just a few things to take care of before we open.
Well, whatever it is, it'll have to wait.
Emma called.
She needs to see us right away.
Give it back, kevin.
The camera is emma's, not yours.
Emma, that's you.
You must be...
Are you missing the part where she's with the snow queen?
Emma, you knew her before you came to storybrooke?
Apparently my run-in with her in town
Wasn't the only memory she erased.
All this time in this foster home,
Or whatever that place was...
it's gone.
Look, I-I just don't understand
How she even ended up in this world.
We were hoping gold could tell us that.
You spent more time trying to get here than anyone.
Considering the time I spent on the same task,
Does it really matter how she got to emma?
I mean, shouldn't we be more concerned about why?
Obviously, she needed her for something.
But what?
Well, that's our next problem.
Well, we know she's hiding somewhere in the north woods.
We combed every inch of her shop.
We tore apart her house.
Which means she must be hiding something.
But where?
What about her ice-cream truck?
Whoa, snow queen has an ice-cream truck?
I'm a kid.
I notice these kind of things.
Then we split up into groups.
We search the town, the woods.
Hook, regina, emma, you take the west.
Gold, you're with me for the east.
I think we all know I work best alone.
Well, no time to argue that.
Belle, how are you at tracking?
Uh, actually, I-I think I'll be more helpful at the library.
Maybe I can dig something up on the snow queen.
I'd like to come with you, belle, if that's okay.
Maybe something about my sister will be there, too.
Unless you'd rather not have the company?
No, n-not at all.
I would love some.
It's late.
You should be in bed.
How can I possibly sleep when I can't even remember
What happened to mother?
Perhaps that's for the best.
I need to know what happened to her after I blacked out.
You won't find the answers you seek in the pages of a book.
But I already have, father.
According to this, there are creatures
Who can restore memories that have been lost.
If we journey to them, maybe they can help me remember
What happened to mother.
I can't allow you to do that.
Why not?
Because there's something this book doesn't tell you.
Magic always comes with a price.
And whatever that price is,
I don't want you to have to pay it.
I'm sorry, belle,
But I've already lost your mother
To this infernal ogres war.
I can't lose you, too.
But father...
you heard me!
No, no!
Forget this nonsense!
You are not to leave this chamber
Until the doctors say you're better!
I'm sorry, father, but I need to know what happened.
And this...
Is the only place where I'll find the answer.
Arendelle.
There doesn't seem to be anything on arendelle here.
Do you know where to look?
No, I'm...
I'm sorry.
I'm...
I'm really not that familiar with arendelle,
O-or... or your sister.
Elsa?
Anna!
Oh!
Oh, I was worried I'd never see you again.
I'm afraid you're stuck with me.
I'm sorry I left without telling you.
Oh, and I'm sorry I made you feel like you had to.
I know you did it for me, to try to make me feel better.
So, what did you learn?
Did you discover why our parents went to the enchanted forest?
What is it, anna?
What did you find?
Nothing.
I mean, I'm still waiting on some answers
From a few people I met,
But I wouldn't expect anything anytime soon
Because they have to find it out,
It could take a while, a long while, and...
Wait, no flurries?
No frost on the windows?
Usually a conversation about our parents ends
With a chill in the air.
I've been learning to control my powers when I get upset.
Really?
How?
By training with me.
Who is that?
I mean, who are you?
I-I mean...
Hi.
She's our aunt.
Our what?
Your aunt.
My name is ingrid.
Your mother and I were sisters.
You look exactly like her.
But our mother doesn't have a sister.
At least, she never told us about one.
I'm sure it was too painful for her to talk about.
You see, many years ago,
I was trapped in a magical urn by...
People who didn't exactly understand me.
Didn't understand you?
Our gift runs in the family.
I'm telling you, that woman is up to something.
What, you mean your aunt?
What makes you think that?
'cause it's weird and strange, her being here.
And because I'm a good judge of character.
Yeah, says the girl who agreed to marry hans 10 minutes after you started talking to him.
I was young and naive.
You met me the next day.
Young-er.
Anyway, I just want to make sure
We're asking all the right questions.
Like what?
Like, is she really even my aunt,
Or is she just some imposter
Trying to worm her way into our family?
Anna, look at her.
You can't see the resemblance?
Oh, yes, the ice-power thing, there's that.
Maybe, but if she's really my aunt,
Why isn't she in the family portraits,
The royal records?
There's no trace of her.
It's like she never even existed.
There has to be an explanation for all this.
Yeah?
And how do you think you're gonna find it?
Your family.
Grand pabbie's still a little miffed
That you postponed the wedding.
I can handle grand pabbie.
Will you go back to the castle and cover for me...
Watch elsa while I'm gone?
If it'll put your mind at ease, of course.
You have to be careful what you say around her.
I...
Might not...
I might not exactly have told her
What I discovered in the enchanted forest.
You lied to her?
Ohh, I didn't lie.
I just...
Withheld the truth.
Telling her our parents wanted to take away her magic I just have to find the right moment.
That's all.
Right, right.
Of course.
Yeah.
You know I'll support you no matter what.
Unless I think it's really dumb.
Thank goodness I haven't hit "really dumb" yet.
Can I get you supplies for your journey?
You're sweet, but no.
I'll stop by oaken's on the way.
You'll see me as soon as I return.
David, call off the search party.
We found the truck near the merry men's camp.
Thanks for keeping an eye out.
You're the first sheriff I don't mind assisting.
Uh, regina, I was hoping we could talk.
Um, in case you haven't noticed,
I'm about to storm an evil ice-cream truck.
You could have just said, "maybe later."
I know you're trying to make everything better,
But staying out of it is your best bet.
It's bad enough I'm stuck with you and captain guy-liner
Making eyes at each other.
I don't make eyes.
Ready, love?
It appears she beat us to it.
She's cleared out the vessel.
Should we question the cows she gets her milk from?
Maybe search the waffle-cone factory?
Hang on.
Look.
Who locks their freezer?
Was she afraid someone was gonna steal the rocky road?
Stand back.
Looks like the dairy queen's
Been following me for a long time.
Since before foster care?
Since I landed in this world.
Are you okay?
This is pointless.
I don't know why I thought
I'd find anything about anna in here.
You know she's somewhere.
You know she's alive.
You heard her heartbeat with bo-peep's staff, right?
But if what the snow queen told me is true
And anna is the one who put me in that urn,
Then maybe she doesn't want me to find her.
You're just saying that to make me feel better.
No, I promise you, I'm not.
How would you know what my sister thinks?
You've never even met her.
Well, just from what you've been saying,
I-I feel like I know her.
You two were very close.
Something must have pulled you apart...
Something beyond your control.
But my memories are gone,
And no one in this town has even been to arendelle.
I need to face the truth, belle.
No one here can help me,
And I'm afraid that means I might never see anna again.
Okay.
You will.
I know it.
Now, keep looking.
I'll be back.
What?
Where are you going?
There's something I-I need to take care of.
We will find anna.
You want to find trolls?
You know they're dangerous, yeah?
Oh, no, no, no.
Rock trolls, not bridge trolls.
Oh, yeah, they're quite nice.
So, you can...
you can direct me to them?
No.
I've never met them.
But y-you just said they were nice.
I've heard.
Please help me.
I-I just lost my mother.
Oh, I'm...
I'm so sorry.
Uh, trolls can't bring life.
But I can help soothe you.
Have you tried the sauna?
Uh, no, no.
Thank you.
Need some help?
Uh, well, I was trying to find my way to the rock trolls,
But this map is not being too helpful.
Oaken means well.
Yeah!
But you don't need him or a map.
I'm on my way to see them.
Come with me.
Really?
Thank you.
Uh, I'm belle.
I'm anna.
Friend of anna's?
Half price on the sauna.
I can't help but think you're avoiding me.
Well, not very well, it seems.
You're upset because of what I said...
That I'm still in love with you.
I suppose I should never have told you,
Not after I asked you to find a way to save my wife.
That's not why I'm avoiding you.
Then why can't you even look me in the eye?
Because I don't know how to tell you the truth.
You know you can tell me anything.
I've read every spell book in my possession,
Experimented with every potion in my vault.
I even tried to defeat the snow queen
So I could force her to reverse the spell.
But...
Nothing I do seems good enough.
But it will be, regina.
I have faith in you.
You will figure out a way eventually.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm not sure I can figure it out.
Robin, I'm sorry,
But if you truly want to save marian...
You're gonna have to forget about me...
And...
Find a way...
To fall in love with your wife again.
You can show yourself, dearie.
I'm not the one you're hiding from.
No, you're not.
To what do I owe this intrusion?
A warning.
Emma swan is onto you.
She knows your history began
Long before you came to storybrooke.
I'm aware.
Do you really think she would have discovered that
If I hadn't wanted her to?
It's all part of my plan...
A plan you thankfully know little about.
You're being awfully secretive.
You didn't come to warn me.
You came to find out my secrets.
Or offer up a deal.
Whatever suits you best.
But if you decline, I'd be careful.
There it is.
There's the warning.
You want something out of me?
Why don't you just ask for it?
If I wanted something out of you, dearie,
Believe me, I'd take it.
But you can't, can you?
Otherwise you would.
You and I both know...
to get what you want,
You need one thing that I have and you're sorely lacking...
Leverage.
And until you get that...
I have a warning for you.
Stay out of my way.
Don't worry, anna.
I'll find you.
So, belle...
Well, actually, I could, but I'm naturally curious.
Anyway...
I heard you lost your mother.
Yes, in the...
in the ogres war.
I'm so sorry.
I lost mine, too.
There are no words.
No, there aren't,
Especially when you don't know what happened.
I was hoping the rock trolls could restore my memory
So that I can finally be at peace.
Sometimes the answer isn't what you want.
Which is what?
One that makes you feel better.
But if grand pabbie can help you get what you need,
I'll make sure he does.
Thank you.
Uh...
So, now what?
Now we climb.
Okay.
Okay.
You okay?
Ohh.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Whoo!
Oh!
Kristoff makes this look easy!
Here.
Careful!
Careful.
Why?
W-what's inside?
A hat which can strip the magic
From the most powerful of sorcerers.
Why do you have such a thing?
I sort of stole it from an evil sorcerer
When I was back in the enchanted forest.
I went to him to help with my sister,
But things didn't exactly go according to plan.
Why?
What...
what happened?
Who...
who is this person?
I-I'd really rather not get into it.
The less you know, the better.
I just pray you never cross paths with that twisted man.
Where are you headed?
To the north woods, where the snow queen's hiding.
And what business do you have with her?
I have to fix a mistake that I made a long time ago.
What are you talking about?
I'm afraid I can't tell you.
You wouldn't understand.
Whether or not that's true,
The fact remains that she defeated both emma and regina.
She is far more dangerous than you realize.
I know.
That's why I was...
I was hoping you'd come with me.
I'm sorry, belle.
That's out of the question.
I won't let you anywhere near her.
I was worried you were gonna say that.
Because...
I really...
Really didn't want to do this.
Bell, I gave you that dagger because I trusted you Because I thought you would never want to control me.
I know.
I know, and I'm so, so sorry, rumple.
But if you won't come with me willingly,
What choice do I have?
Take me to the snow queen.
She was my foster parent for six months.
Aye?
That's the longest I was ever in one spot,
But I don't remember a second of it.
I'm fine.
It was all a long time ago.
Mm, perhaps, but wounds that are made when we're young
Tend to linger.
How would you know?
Believe it or not, I was once a child.
Yeah, like a million years ago.
It was more like 200.
What is it?
It's a painting I did when I was in school.
That so surprising?
It's not the only one.
This crazy woman has a whole file
Of my old art projects and essays.
Just like the one I have for henry.
You don't keep stuff like this
Unless you care about someone.
Well, perhaps the snow queen wasn't simply using you.
Perhaps she'd grown fond of you over time.
Looks like the feeling was mutual.
"thanks for being the family I never had.
Love, emma."
I wrote that to her.
Looks like you two were close once.
But she still erased my memories.
Something must have happened to change all that.
There has to be a clue as to why.
Perhaps there is...
If you can read hieroglyphs.
This isn't from our world.
What the hell was she doing with me?
This is it?
This is where she's hiding?
Indeed.
But she's not at home.
I don't sense her magic.
Good.
Okay.
You stay here as lookout.
I'm going in.
No, belle, y-you're not going in there alone.
Look, I won't be long.
I just need to find something.
What could you possibly want from the snow queen's cave?
A hat...
One that can strip a magical being of their powers.
That sounds like a remarkable object...
Almost too good to be true, which means it probably is.
It isn't, and I know she has it,
And I need to get it from her.
It's the only way to force her to tell us where anna is.
So this is about elsa's sister?
Why are you so invested in a girl you've never even met?
Because a hero always helps strangers.
Now keep watch.
I'll call out to you if I need your help.
Grand pabbie?
Grand pabbie, it's me!
Ooh, anna, my dear, you're back!
Have you come to tell us the new wedding date?
I have been working on my speech.
Not yet, but we can get into that later.
First, I want you to meet my friend belle.
She's come a long way to see you.
It's an honor to meet you.
I'm, uh...
I'm here because I-I...
I know.
I can help you get the memories of your mother.
Take this to the place where you lost your memory,
Then brew a tea with the stone in the kettle.
When you drink it, your memories will return.
Thank you.
Thank you, anna.
I-I owe you, as well.
How can I repay you?
Having a new friend is payment enough.
All I need is a moment alone with pabbie.
I'll be quick.
What can I help you with, dear?
Some woman claims to be my aunt.
I just don't believe her!
Mother would have told us if she had a sister.
Actually, she had two sisters.
Wait.
What?
Mother had two sisters that she never spoke about?
Why didn't she say anything?
Why didn't you say anything?
Because I was sworn to secrecy.
Grand pabbie, I need some answers.
Please.
Your mother, gerda, was the youngest of three.
And then there was helga, and ingrid was the oldest.
As children, the three girls were quite close,
Often seen playing together in the royal gardens.
But then, one day, helga and ingrid vanished.
No one ever knew what happened to them.
It was a tragedy the royal family wanted to forget.
And they did, with my help.
You took the memories of everyone in arendelle?
Yes.
And the royal family erased mention of helga and ingrid
From every book and record they could find in our realm.
Why wouldn't ingrid tell me what happened,
Or that she had another sister?
Those are questions you'd have to ask your aunt.
Like she would tell me.
If she's keeping these secrets,
Who knows what else she's hiding.
I have to warn elsa.
Belle, we have to go!
What?
Is everything okay?
I don't think so.
It's my aunt.
She's up to something.
The hat must be in here somewhere.
Belle.
Belle.
Belle!
Over here, belle.
Over here, belle.
Over...
Here.
Hello, belle!
I was hoping you'd find me.
I wish I didn't have to wait to use this.
You'll be home before you know it.
We'll put you on the first ship back to the enchanted forest.
If any ships are even setting sail.
It...
Looks like a storm's setting in.
I don't think it's a storm.
Well, what else could it be?
My aunt.
I don't think my aunt wants me to tell my sister
What I found out.
Well, if she...
Has all this magic and...
And you have, well, g-good intentions,
Then what are we gonna do?
I have more than good intentions!
She can't hurt us if she doesn't have magic.
Belle!
Belle!
I can't pull myself up!
Just hold on!
I'll be right there!
Belle, hurry!
Please!
Oh!
Belle, hurry!
I'm coming!
I'm coming.
Anna!
Leave her alone!
You'll have to excuse us, but this is family business.
I'm surprised you were brave enough
To come in here.
I had to.
I have to find a way to help anna.
Why?
You never really cared much for her before.
That's not true.
Sure, it is.
You chose that rock over her.
You had to remember what happened to your mother,
No matter what the cost.
I made a mistake.
I didn't mean to...
Ruin someone's life?
It certainly wasn't your most heroic moment.
Not that you've ever really been hero material.
No, please...
Please stop.
Everyone sees you for what you really are, belle...
A pathetic coward.
I mean, why do you think the dark one married you?
You think it was love?
He needed someone weak, someone he could manipulate.
That's not true.
He loves me.
He gave me this.
You truly believe that's real?
Deep down,
You know what kind of beast you're dealing with.
Belle!
Belle.
The snow queen's approaching the cave.
Belle.
Look at me.
Don't look in the mirror.
Look at me.
We have to leave.
Please, let me go!
It's okay.
Let...
let me go!
It's okay.
We're back in the shop.
We're back in the shop.
It's okay.
No, no!
It's okay.
Wait.
No.
You were outside the cave.
I commanded that you wait there.
You commanded me to keep watch.
I sensed she was coming back.
I came to find you, and I'm glad I did.
I...
I hurt you.
I...
I'm so sorry, rumple.
It's okay.
When I f-found that mirror, something came over me,
Like a...
like a spell.
And... and it spoke to me and made me...
Made me believe all these horrible things,
And it said to me that the dagger you gave me is fake.
I can assure you that nothing that mirror said is true.
It was imbued with the darkest of magic.
I-I know you would never wrong me.
I have wronged you.
I've kept a terrible secret from you.
I'm the reason...
That anna's missing.
I didn't want anyone to know
Until I could make things right and save anna.
But I couldn't.
I failed.
And all I managed to do was abuse the dagger
And... and take advantage of you, my true love.
I-I don't even know if I...
If I deserve to be with you anymore.
No, no, no.
You were only doing what you thought was right.
You... you forgive me?
Of course I forgive you.
Thank you for telling me everything.
Thank you for understanding.
I never should have kept a secret from you,
Especially 'cause I know
That you'd never keep one from me.
I love you, rumple.
And I love you, too.
Father, I...
I-I thought you'd be asleep.
I haven't slept in days.
How could I when you left without so much as a goodbye?
So, did you find what you were looking for?
No.
You were right, father.
I should have just left things alone.
That trip was a huge mistake.
I'm the one who's made the mistake, belle.
I've been keeping a secret from you.
I know what happened during the ogre attack.
Wait, what?
!
I didn't want to add to your grief.
When the ogres stormed the library
Where you and your mother had been working,
They rushed in.
They saw the ogres were about to attack.
She stood in the path of those monsters to protect you.
She kept them at bay
While the guards pulled you from danger.
But by the time they came to save your mother...
It was too late.
She sacrificed herself for me.
She loved you so much, and so do I.
I'm so glad you're back.
I don't know what I would have done
If the ogres had gotten you on the road.
They... they have reached the roads?
The war is not going well.
But you need not worry of such things.
We have soldiers to fight.
But those soldiers don't stand a chance.
They'll only slow down the ogres' advance.
We need someone who can stop them once and for all.
And who would that be?
On my journey, I did some reading.
And, well...
There's a wizard, a powerful, powerful wizard,
Who may just help us.
His name is...
I know his name!
And I dare not speak it.
Trust me, belle, if we do...
I know.
Magic always comes with a price.
But if mother's death taught me anything,
It's that sometimes a hero has to sacrifice everything
To save the people they love,
And I will do whatever I can to save our land.
And I can be a hero, just like mother.
And if that means summoning rumplestiltskin...
Then so be it.
I'm afraid we have a problem, dearie.
I caught a glimpse of your mirror today.
It's rather impressive, isn't it?
I had no idea your bride would be so easy to turn.
Watch yourself.
Now, I don't know exactly when you intend to use this mirror,
But you should know this.
I won't allow you to hurt those I care about.
And I won't allow you to derail my plans
Because you've suddenly gotten sentimental.
You only get one warning.
Which is more than you get.
I can't make any promises
Over who may or who may not survive.
You know, you were wrong before.
That you needed leverage to get what you want?
No, that I didn't have it.
I do.
Where did you get that?
Oh, that's irrelevant.
But now that I know what you're up to,
We can have a real talk.
You might want to reconsider your position,
Because I doubt you'd enjoy
Becoming just another embroidery on this hat.
Looks like you've just lost your leverage, dearie.
Anna.
It's time to wake up, dear.
What?
Where am I?
Exactly where you belong.
You can't just lock me in here!
Elsa won't stand for it!
Even when she finds out what you were planning to do to her?
Wait.
What?
You were planning to use this to strip away her magic.
No, that's not why I had it.
Really?
Then why didn't you tell elsa about it?
Because I-I didn't know how to tell her the truth.
I found it with a man that our parents sought out.
They went to him looking for a way
To strip elsa of the thing that makes her special.
And you're following in their footsteps.
I wasn't going to use it on her.
I wasn't going to use it on anybody...
Until you attacked me.
The rock trolls told me what you've been hiding,
That you and my mother had another sister.
The rock trolls shouldn't talk about things
That they don't understand.
But it's true.
What happened to her?
Some secrets are better left buried.
I don't understand.
What do you want?
!
What I have always wanted A family who will embrace me for who I am.
For a brief moment,
I thought the three of us could be that family...
You, me, and elsa.
But you showed me that plan would never work.
You have nothing in common with elsa and me.
You are the odd woman out.
And now I suppose I have to find someone else
To take your place.
The snow queen is your aunt?
According to this heraldry book I found in the library.
Her name is ingrid.
I didn't even know my mother had any sisters.
Well, spend a little more time in this town, love,
You'll realize just about everyone's related.
This book traces the lineage in arendelle
For generations.
That's gerda, my mother.
And this is helga, my other aunt.
Bloody hell.
Look at this one...
she looks just like you.
Maybe that's why she was so obsessed with you,
Why she kept all those relics from your childhood.
She came to this world looking for blondes?
There's a lot more than just me.
Don't I know it.
She wasn't looking for a blonde.
She was looking for the savior.
What?
This scroll...
the writing is runic.
It's a prophecy.
It says, "the name of the savior is emma."
Before you even did.
She knew you were powerful.
But why?
It says it right here...
"and the savior shall become ingrid's sister."
What the hell does that mean?
Well, my mother died, and her other sister...
She's not around anymore.
I think ingrid believes in this prophecy.
I think she's looking to replace them.
Elsa.
Yes.
I...
I'm sorry.
I am so, so sorry, but I-I've been keeping a secret.
I know your sister, anna.
She helped me once.
But when I had a chance to help her, I let her down.
And because I did,
She was captured by the snow queen.
What?
Where did this happen?
When?
Arendelle...
A long, long time ago.
And I have no idea where she is now.
But, uh, I'm afraid we have a more pressing concern.
The snow queen has a mirror imbued with terrible magic
That can do terrible things.
Mirror?
Easy enough, let's just go smash it.
It's not that simple.
Rumple told me it's part of an awful spell...
The spell of shattered sight.
If she casts it,
Its magic will make everyone in storybrooke
Turn on one another.
Bloody hell.
The entire town will destroy itself.
And there'd be no one left.
Except us.
What makes you think that she'd spare you and elsa?
Because of this.
She wants it to be just the three of us.
Her perfect family.
Previously on Once Upon A Time...
Robin:
Marian!
So, how do we break the spell?
Regina:
True love's kiss.
There's a reason that kiss didn't work.
I'm in love with someone else.
She's still your wife.
Soon I will have what I want.
A family that loves me.
The wall... it's fallen.
We must leave now.
The town will soon be overrun.
These books are too valuable to leave to those monsters.
My lady, please.
Take these trunks to the carriage.
I'll be just behind you.
- And your daughter?
- I will find her.
Now go.
Darling, we must leave, quickly!
Where are you?
Belle:
I'm right here, mother!
I'm sorry, but I couldn't leave without this.
It's the first story you ever read to me, remember?
It's what made me fall in love with books.
Of course I remember, my Belle.
Quickly, we must flee befo...
- [Rumbling] - [Gasps]
[Gasps] They're here.
We will hide till they pass.
[Rumbling]
[Both panting]
[Thud]
[Both gasp]
Ogres!
[Growling]
- [Gasps]
- Shh!
It's going to be all right.
- [Both scream] - [Roars]
[Gasps] Mother?
!
M...
Belle, why aren't you in bed?
What happened?
W-where's mother?
You mean... you don't remember?
Remember what, father?
I...
[Gasps]
[Indistinct whispering]
[Exhales sharply] No.
Rumple?
- Belle.
- Hey, I've been...
Been looking all over the house for you.
Didn't even hear you leave.
Well, I didn't want to wake you.
Just a few things to take care of before we open.
Well, whatever it is, it'll have to wait.
Emma called.
She needs to see us right away.
[Sighs]
Give it back, Kevin.
The camera is Emma's, not yours.
[Click]
Emma, that's you.
You must be... 13, maybe 14.
Are you missing the part where she's with the snow queen?
Emma, you knew her before you came to Storybrooke?
Apparently my run-in with her in town wasn't the only memory she erased.
All this time in this foster home, or whatever that place was... it's gone.
Look, I-I just don't understand how she even ended up in this world.
We were hoping gold could tell us that.
You spent more time trying to get here than anyone.
How the hell did she do it?
Considering the time I spent on the same task,
I'd love to know.
Does it really matter how she got to Emma?
I mean, shouldn't we be more concerned about why?
Obviously, she needed her for something.
But what?
[Scoffs] Well, that's our next problem.
Well, we know she's hiding somewhere in the north woods.
We combed every inch of her shop.
We tore apart her house.
She must have cleared everything out days before.
Which means she must be hiding something.
But where?
What about her ice-cream truck?
Whoa, snow queen has an ice-cream truck?
I'm a kid.
I notice these kind of things.
Then we split up into groups.
We search the town, the woods.
Hook, Regina, Emma, you take the west.
Gold, you're with me for the east.
I think we all know I work best alone.
Well, no time to argue that.
Belle, how are you at tracking?
Uh, actually, I-I think I'll be more helpful at the library.
Maybe I can dig something up on the snow queen.
I'd like to come with you, Belle, if that's okay.
Maybe something about my sister will be there, too.
Unless you'd rather not have the company?
No, n-not at all.
I would love some.
It's late.
You should be in bed.
How can I possibly sleep when I can't even remember what happened to mother?
Perhaps that's for the best.
No!
I need to know what happened to her after I blacked out.
You won't find the answers you seek in the pages of a book.
But I already have, father.
According to this, there are creatures who can restore memories that have been lost.
If we journey to them, maybe they can help me remember what happened to mother.
I can't allow you to do that.
Why not?
Because there's something this book doesn't tell you.
Magic always comes with a price.
And whatever that price is,
I don't want you to have to pay it.
I'm sorry, Belle, but I've already lost your mother to this infernal ogres war.
I can't lose you, too.
- But father...
- You heard me!
No, no!
Forget this nonsense!
You are not to leave this chamber until the doctors say you're better!
[Door closes]
I'm sorry, father, but I need to know what happened.
And this...
Is the only place where I'll find the answer.
Arendelle.
There doesn't seem to be anything on Arendelle here.
Do you know where to look?
No, I'm...
I'm sorry.
I'm...
I'm really not that familiar with Arendelle, o-or... or your sister.
Elsa?
Anna!
Oh!
Oh, I was worried I'd never see you again.
I'm afraid you're stuck with me.
I'm sorry I left without telling you.
Oh, and I'm sorry I made you feel like you had to.
I know you did it for me, to try to make me feel better.
[Sighs]
So, what did you learn?
Did you discover why our parents went to the enchanted forest?
What is it, Anna?
What did you find?
Nothing.
I mean, I'm still waiting on some answers from a few people I met, but I wouldn't expect anything anytime soon because they have to find it out, then get on a ship and come here.
It could take a while, a long while, and...
Wait, no flurries?
No frost on the windows?
Usually a conversation about our parents ends with a chill in the air.
I've been learning to control my powers when I get upset.
Really?
How?
By training with me.
Who is that?
I mean, who are you?
I-I mean...
Hi.
She's our aunt.
Our what?
Your aunt.
My name is Ingrid.
Your mother and I were sisters.
You look exactly like her.
[Sighs]
But our mother doesn't have a sister.
At least, she never told us about one.
I'm sure it was too painful for her to talk about.
You see, many years ago,
I was trapped in a magical urn by...
People who didn't exactly understand me.
Didn't understand you?
[Whoosh]
Our gift runs in the family.
Anna:
I'm telling you, that woman is up to something.
What, you mean your aunt?
What makes you think that?
'Cause it's weird and strange, her being here.
And because I'm a good judge of character.
Yeah, says the girl who agreed to marry hans 10 minutes after you started talking to him.
I was young and naive.
You met me the next day.
Young-er.
Anyway, I just want to make sure we're asking all the right questions.
- Like what?
- Like, is she really even my aunt, or is she just some imposter trying to worm her way into our family?
Anna, look at her.
You can't see the resemblance?
Oh, yes, the ice-power thing, there's that.
Maybe, but if she's really my aunt, why isn't she in the family portraits, the royal records?
There's no trace of her.
It's like she never even existed.
There has to be an explanation for all this.
Yeah?
And how do you think you're gonna find it?
Your family.
Careful.
Grand Pabbie's still a little miffed that you postponed the wedding.
I can handle grand Pabbie.
Will you go back to the castle and cover for me... watch Elsa while I'm gone?
If it'll put your mind at ease, of course.
Oh, but, Kristoff, you have to be careful what you say around her.
I...
Might not...
I might not exactly have told her what I discovered in the enchanted forest.
You lied to her?
Ohh, I didn't lie.
I just... withheld the truth.
Telling her our parents wanted to take away her magic...
I just have to find the right moment.
That's all.
Right, right.
Of course.
Yeah.
You know I'll support you no matter what.
Unless I think it's really dumb.
Then I'll tell you.
Thank goodness I haven't hit "really dumb" yet.
Can I get you supplies for your journey?
You're sweet, but no.
I'll stop by oaken's on the way.
You'll see me as soon as I return.
Emma:
David, call off the search party.
We found the truck near the merry men's camp.
Thanks for keeping an eye out.
Gladly.
You're the first sheriff I don't mind assisting.
Uh, Regina, I was hoping we could talk.
Um, in case you haven't noticed,
I'm about to storm an evil ice-cream truck.
You could have just said, "maybe later."
I know you're trying to make everything better, but staying out of it is your best bet.
It's bad enough I'm stuck with you and captain guy-liner making eyes at each other.
I don't make eyes.
Ready, love?
[Sighs]
It appears she beat us to it.
She's cleared out the vessel.
What now?
Should we question the cows she gets her milk from?
Maybe search the waffle-cone factory?
Hang on.
Look.
Who locks their freezer?
Was she afraid someone was gonna steal the Rocky road?
Stand back.
Looks like the dairy queen's been following me for a long time.
Since before foster care?
Since I landed in this world.
Belle:
Are you okay?
This is pointless.
I don't know why I thought
I'd find anything about Anna in here.
You know she's somewhere.
You know she's alive.
You heard her heartbeat with Bo-peep's staff, right?
But if what the snow queen told me is true and Anna is the one who put me in that urn, then maybe she doesn't want me to find her.
That's not true, Elsa.
You're just saying that to make me feel better.
No, I promise you, I'm not.
How would you know what my sister thinks?
You've never even met her.
Well, just from what you've been saying,
I-I feel like I know her.
You two were very close.
Something must have pulled you apart... something beyond your control.
[Voice breaking] But my memories are gone, and no one in this town has even been to Arendelle.
I need to face the truth, Belle.
No one here can help me, and I'm afraid that means I might never see Anna again.
[Sighs] Okay.
You will.
[Scoffs]
I know it.
Now, keep looking.
I'll be back.
What?
Where are you going?
There's something I-I need to take care of.
We will find Anna.
You want to find trolls?
You know they're dangerous, yeah?
Oh, no, no, no.
Rock trolls, not bridge trolls.
Oh, yeah, they're quite nice.
So, you can... - you can direct me to them?
No.
I've never met them.
Yoo-hoo!
But y-you just said they were nice.
I've heard.
[Sighs]
Please help me.
I-I just lost my mother.
Oh, I'm...
I'm so sorry.
Uh, trolls can't bring life.
But I can help soothe you.
Have you tried the sauna?
Uh, no, no.
Thank you.
Anna:
Need some help?
Uh, well, I was trying to find my way to the rock trolls, but this map is not being too helpful.
Oaken means well.
- Yeah!
- But you don't need him or a map.
I can help you.
I'm on my way to see them.
Come with me.
Really?
[Laughing] Thank you.
Uh, I'm Belle.
I'm Anna.
Friend of Anna's?
Half price on the sauna.
- [Sighs]
- I can't help but think
- you're avoiding me.
- [Sighs]
Well, not very well, it seems.
You're upset because of what I said... that I'm still in love with you.
I suppose I should never have told you, not after I asked you to find a way to save my wife.
That's not why I'm avoiding you.
Then why can't you even look me in the eye?
Because I don't know how to tell you the truth.
You know you can tell me anything.
I've read every spell book in my possession, experimented with every potion in my vault.
I even tried to defeat the snow queen so I could force her to reverse the spell.
But...
Nothing I do seems good enough.
But it will be, Regina.
I have faith in you.
You will figure out a way eventually.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm not sure I can figure it out.
Robin, I'm sorry, but if you truly want to save Marian...
You're gonna have to forget about me...
And...
Find a way...
To fall in love with your wife again.
You can show yourself, dearie.
I'm not the one you're hiding from.
No, you're not.
To what do I owe this intrusion?
A warning.
Emma Swan is onto you.
She knows your history began long before you came to Storybrooke.
I'm aware.
Do you really think she would have discovered that if I hadn't wanted her to?
It's all part of my plan... a plan you thankfully know little about.
You're being awfully secretive.
You didn't come to warn me.
You came to find out my secrets.
Or offer up a deal.
Whatever suits you best.
But if you decline, I'd be careful.
There it is.
There's the warning.
You want something out of me?
Why don't you just ask for it?
If I wanted something out of you, dearie, believe me, I'd take it.
But you can't, can you?
Otherwise you would.
You and I both know...
to get what you want, you need one thing that I have and you're sorely lacking... leverage.
And until you get that...
I have a warning for you.
Stay out of my way.
[Breathing heavily]
Don't worry, Anna.
I'll find you.
So, Belle...
I couldn't help overhearing...
Well, actually, I could, but I'm naturally curious.
Anyway...
I heard you lost your mother.
Yes, in the... in the ogres war.
I'm so sorry.
I lost mine, too.
There are no words.
[Sighs] No, there aren't, especially when you don't know what happened.
I was hoping the rock trolls could restore my memory so that I can finally be at peace.
Sometimes the answer isn't what you want.
Which is what?
One that makes you feel better.
But if grand Pabbie can help you get what you need,
I'll make sure he does.
Thank you.
Uh...
So, now what?
Now we climb.
Okay.
[Grunts]
[Laughs]
Belle:
Okay.
- [Screams] - [Gasps]
You okay?
- Ohh.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Whoo!
Oh!
Kristoff makes this look easy!
[Sighs]
Here.
Careful!
Careful.
Why?
W-what's inside?
A hat which can strip the magic from the most powerful of sorcerers.
Why do you have such a thing?
I sort of stole it from an evil sorcerer when I was back in the enchanted forest.
[Sighs] I went to him to help with my sister, but things didn't exactly go according to plan.
Why?
What...
what happened?
Who... who is this person?
I-I'd really rather not get into it.
The less you know, the better.
I just pray you never cross paths with that twisted man.
[Door bells jingle]
Belle.
[Door closes] Where are you headed?
To the north woods, where the snow queen's hiding.
And what business do you have with her?
I have to fix a mistake that I made a long time ago.
What are you talking about?
I'm afraid I can't tell you.
You wouldn't understand.
Whether or not that's true, the fact remains that she defeated both Emma and Regina.
She is far more dangerous than you realize.
I know.
That's why I was...
I was hoping you'd come with me.
[Scoffs] I'm sorry, Belle.
That's out of the question.
I won't let you anywhere near her.
I was worried you were gonna say that.
Because...
I really...
Really didn't want to do this.
Bell, I gave you that dagger because I trusted you... because I thought you would never want to control me.
I know.
I know, and I'm so, so sorry, rumple.
But if you won't come with me willingly, what choice do I have?
Take me to the snow queen.
Emma:
According to this, she was my foster parent for six months.
Aye?
That's the longest I was ever in one spot, but I don't remember a second of it.
You all right, Swan?
I'm fine.
It was all a long time ago.
Mm, perhaps, but wounds that are made when we're young
- tend to linger.
- How would you know?
Believe it or not, I was once a child.
Yeah, like a million years ago.
It was more like 200.
What is it?
It's a painting I did when I was in school.
That so surprising?
It's not the only one.
This crazy woman has a whole file of my old art projects and essays.
Just like the one I have for Henry.
You don't keep stuff like this unless you care about someone.
Well, perhaps the snow queen wasn't simply using you.
Perhaps she'd grown fond of you over time.
Looks like the feeling was mutual.
"Thanks for being the family I never had."
"Love, Emma."
I wrote that to her.
Looks like you two were close once.
But she still erased my memories.
Something must have happened to change all that.
There has to be a clue as to why.
Perhaps there is...
If you can read hieroglyphs.
This isn't from our world.
What the hell was she doing with me?
This is it?
This is where she's hiding?
Indeed.
But she's not at home.
I don't sense her magic.
Good.
Okay.
You stay here as lookout.
I'm going in.
No, Belle, y-you're not going in there alone.
Look, I won't be long.
I just need to find something.
What could you possibly want from the snow queen's cave?
A hat... one that can strip a magical being of their powers.
That sounds like a remarkable object... almost too good to be true, which means it probably is.
It isn't, and I know she has it, and I need to get it from her.
It's the only way to force her to tell us where Anna is.
So this is about Elsa's sister?
Why are you so invested in a girl you've never even met?
Because a hero always helps strangers.
Now keep watch.
I'll call out to you if I need your help.
Grand Pabbie?
Grand Pabbie, it's me!
Ooh, Anna, my dear, you're back!
Have you come to tell us the new wedding date?
I have been working on my speech.
Not yet, but we can get into that later.
First, I want you to meet my friend Belle.
She's come a long way to see you.
It's an honor to meet you.
I'm, uh...
I'm here because I-I...
I know.
I can help you get the memories of your mother.
[Whoosh]
Take this to the place where you lost your memory, then brew a tea with the stone in the kettle.
When you drink it, your memories will return.
Thank you.
[Sighs]
Thank you, Anna.
I-I owe you, as well.
How can I repay you?
You don't have to.
Having a new friend is payment enough.
All I need is a moment alone with Pabbie.
I'll be quick.
What can I help you with, dear?
Some woman claims to be my aunt.
[Sighs] I just don't believe her!
Mother would have told us if she had a sister.
Actually, she had two sisters.
Wait.
What?
Mother had two sisters that she never spoke about?
Why didn't she say anything?
Why didn't you say anything?
Because I was sworn to secrecy.
Grand Pabbie, I need some answers.
Please.
[Sighs]
Your mother, Gerda, was the youngest of three.
And then there was Helga, and Ingrid was the oldest.
As children, the three girls were quite close, often seen playing together in the royal gardens.
But then, one day, Helga and Ingrid vanished.
No one ever knew what happened to them.
It was a tragedy the royal family wanted to forget.
And they did, with my help.
You took the memories of everyone in Arendelle?
Yes.
And the royal family erased mention of Helga and Ingrid from every book and record they could find in our realm.
Why wouldn't Ingrid tell me what happened, or that she had another sister?
Those are questions you'd have to ask your aunt.
[Sighs] Like she would tell me.
If she's keeping these secrets, who knows what else she's hiding.
I have to warn Elsa.
Belle, we have to go!
What?
Is everything okay?
I don't think so.
It's my aunt.
She's up to something.
The hat must be in here somewhere.
Woman: [Echoing] Belle.
Belle.
Belle!
Over here, Belle.
Over here, Belle.
Over...
Here.
Hello, Belle!
[Gasps]
I was hoping you'd find me.
I wish I didn't have to wait to use this.
You'll be home before you know it.
As soon as we get to town, we'll put you on the first ship back to the enchanted forest.
[Wind blows, thunder rumbles]
If any ships are even setting sail.
It...
Looks like a storm's setting in.
I don't think it's a storm.
Well, what else could it be?
My aunt.
I don't think my aunt wants me to tell my sister what I found out.
Well, if she... has all this magic and...
And you have, well, g-good intentions, then what are we gonna do?
I have more than good intentions!
I have this!
She can't hurt us if she doesn't have magic.
[Wind gusts]
[Screams]
[Grunts]
Belle!
Belle!
I can't pull myself up!
Just hold on!
I'll be right there!
Belle, hurry!
Please!
Oh!
[Gasps]
Belle, hurry!
I'm coming!
I'm coming.
[Grunts]
- [Screams]
- Anna!
Leave her alone!
You'll have to excuse us, but this is family business.
Mirror Belle:
I'm surprised you were brave enough to come in here.
I had to.
I have to find a way to help Anna.
Why?
[Scoffs]
You never really cared much for her before.
That's not true.
Sure, it is.
You chose that rock over her.
You had to remember what happened to your mother, no matter what the cost.
I made a mistake.
I didn't mean to...
Ruin someone's life?
[Scoffs]
It certainly wasn't your most heroic moment.
Not that you've ever really been hero material.
No, please... please stop.
Everyone sees you for what you really are, Belle... a pathetic coward.
I mean, why do you think the dark one married you?
You think it was love?
He needed someone weak, someone he could manipulate.
That's not true.
He loves me.
He gave me this.
[Laughs]
You truly believe that's real?
Deep down, you know what kind of beast you're dealing with.
Belle!
Belle.
The snow queen's approaching the cave.
- Belle.
- [Gasps]
Look at me.
Don't look in the mirror.
Look at me.
We have to leave.
- [Grunting]
- Let me go!
- You don't know what you're doing.
- No!
- Please, let me go!
- It's okay.
- Let...
let me go!
- It's okay.
We're back in the shop.
- We're back in the shop.
It's okay.
- No, no!
- It's okay.
- Wait.
No.
You were outside the cave.
I commanded that you wait there.
You commanded me to keep watch.
I sensed she was coming back.
I came to find you, and I'm glad I did.
[Knife clatters]
[Voice breaking] I...
I hurt you.
I...
I'm so sorry, rumple.
It's okay.
When I f-found that mirror, something came over me, like a...
like a spell.
And... and it spoke to me and made me... made me believe all these horrible things, and it said to me that the dagger you gave me is fake.
[Sniffles]
I can assure you that nothing that mirror said is true.
It was imbued with the darkest of magic.
I-I know you would never wrong me.
I have wronged you.
I've kept a terrible secret from you.
I'm the reason... that Anna's missing.
I didn't want anyone to know until I could make things right and save Anna.
But I couldn't.
I failed.
And all I managed to do was abuse the dagger and... and take advantage of you, my true love.
I-I don't even know if I... if I deserve to be with you anymore.
No, no, no.
You were only doing what you thought was right.
You... you forgive me?
Of course I forgive you.
[Crying]
Thank you for telling me everything.
Thank you for understanding.
I never should have kept a secret from you, especially 'cause I know that you'd never keep one from me.
I love you, rumple.
And I love you, too.
[Sighs]
Father, I... [clears throat]
I-I thought you'd be asleep.
I haven't slept in days.
How could I when you left without so much as a goodbye?
So, did you find what you were looking for?
No.
You were right, father.
I should have just left things alone.
That trip was a huge mistake.
I'm the one who's made the mistake, Belle.
I've been keeping a secret from you.
I know what happened during the ogre attack.
Wait, what?
!
I didn't want to add to your grief.
When the ogres stormed the library where you and your mother had been working, the guards heard the commotion.
They rushed in.
They saw the ogres were about to attack.
But your mother, she... she stood in the path of those monsters to protect you.
She kept them at bay while the guards pulled you from danger.
But by the time they came to save your mother...
It was too late.
She sacrificed herself for me.
She loved you so much, and so do I.
I'm so glad you're back.
I don't know what I would have done if the ogres had gotten you on the road.
They... they have reached the roads?
The war is not going well.
But you need not worry of such things.
We have soldiers to fight.
But those soldiers don't stand a chance.
They'll only slow down the ogres' advance.
[Sighs]
We need someone who can stop them once and for all.
And who would that be?
On my journey, I did some reading.
And, well...
There's a wizard, a powerful, powerful wizard, who may just help us.
- His name is...
- I know his name!
And I dare not speak it.
Trust me, Belle, if we do...
I know.
Magic always comes with a price.
[Sighs]
But if mother's death taught me anything, it's that sometimes a hero has to sacrifice everything to save the people they love, and I will do whatever I can to save our land.
And I can be a hero, just like mother.
And if that means summoning Rumplestiltskin...
Then so be it.
I'm afraid we have a problem, dearie.
I caught a glimpse of your mirror today.
It's rather impressive, isn't it?
I had no idea your bride would be so easy to turn.
Watch yourself.
Now, I don't know exactly when you intend to use this mirror, but you should know this.
I won't allow you to hurt those I care about.
And I won't allow you to derail my plans because you've suddenly gotten sentimental.
You only get one warning.
Which is more than you get.
I can't make any promises over who may or who may not survive.
You know, you were wrong before.
That you needed leverage to get what you want?
No, that I didn't have it.
I do.
Where did you get that?
Oh, that's irrelevant.
But now that I know what you're up to, we can have a real talk.
You might want to reconsider your position, because I doubt you'd enjoy becoming just another embroidery on this hat.
Looks like you've just lost your leverage, dearie.
Anna.
It's time to wake up, dear.
What?
Where am I?
Exactly where you belong.
[Bars clatter]
You can't just lock me in here!
Elsa won't stand for it!
Even when she finds out what you were planning to do to her?
Wait.
What?
You were planning to use this to strip away her magic.
No, that's not why I had it.
Really?
Then why didn't you tell Elsa about it?
Because I-I didn't know how to tell her the truth.
I found it with a man that our parents sought out.
They went to him looking for a way to strip Elsa of the thing that makes her special.
And you're following in their footsteps.
I wasn't going to use it on her.
I wasn't going to use it on anybody...
Until you attacked me.
The rock trolls told me what you've been hiding, that you and my mother had another sister.
The rock trolls shouldn't talk about things that they don't understand.
But it's true.
What happened to her?
Some secrets are better left buried.
I don't understand.
What do you want?
!
What I have always wanted... a family who will embrace me for who I am.
For a brief moment,
I thought the three of us could be that family... you, me, and Elsa.
But you showed me that plan would never work.
You have nothing in common with Elsa and me.
You are the odd woman out.
And now I suppose I have to find someone else to take your place.
The snow queen is your aunt?
According to this heraldry book I found in the library.
Her name is Ingrid.
I didn't even know my mother had any sisters.
I'm as surprised as you are.
Well, spend a little more time in this town, love, you'll realize just about everyone's related.
This book traces the lineage in Arendelle for generations.
That's gerda, my mother.
And this is Helga, my other aunt.
Bloody hell.
Look at this one...
she looks just like you.
Maybe that's why she was so obsessed with you, why she kept all those relics from your childhood.
She came to this world looking for blondes?
There's a lot more than just me.
Don't I know it.
[Sighs] She wasn't looking for a blonde.
She was looking for the savior.
What?
This scroll... the writing is runic.
It's a prophecy.
It says, "the name of the savior is Emma."
She knew?
Before you even did.
She knew you were powerful.
But why?
It says it right here...
"And the savior shall become Ingrid's sister."
What the hell does that mean?
Well, my mother died, and her other sister... she's not around anymore.
I think Ingrid believes in this prophecy.
[Door opens] I think she's looking to replace them.
[Footsteps approach] Belle:
Elsa.
[Sighs]
Yes.
I...
I'm sorry.
I am so, so sorry, but...
What?
I-I've been keeping a secret.
I know your sister, Anna.
She helped me once.
But when I had a chance to help her, I let her down.
And because I did, she was captured by the snow queen.
What?
Where did this happen?
When?
Arendelle... a long, long time ago.
And I have no idea where she is now.
But, uh, I'm afraid we have a more pressing concern.
The snow queen has a mirror imbued with terrible magic that can do terrible things.
Mirror?
Easy enough, let's just go smash it.
It's not that simple.
Rumple told me it's part of an awful spell... the spell of shattered sight.
If she casts it, its magic will make everyone in Storybrooke turn on one another.
Bloody hell.
The entire town will destroy itself.
And there'd be no one left.
Except us.
What makes you think that she'd spare you and Elsa?
[Sighing] Because of this.
She wants it to be just the three of us.
Her perfect family.
Previously on Once Upon A Time...
Marian!
So, how do we break the spell?
True love's kiss.
There's a reason that kiss didn't work.
I'm in love with someone else.
She's still your wife.
Soon I will have what I want.
A family that loves me.
The wall... it's fallen.
We must leave now.
The town will soon be overrun.
These books are too valuable to leave to those monsters.
My lady, please.
Take these trunks to the carriage.
I'll be just behind you.
- And your daughter?
- I will find her.
Now go.
Darling, we must leave, quickly!
Where are you?
I'm right here, mother!
I'm sorry, but I couldn't leave without this.
It's the first story you ever read to me, remember?
It's what made me fall in love with books.
Of course I remember, my Belle.
Quickly, we must flee befo...
They're here.
We will hide till they pass.
Ogres!
Shh!
It's going to be all right.
Mother?
!
M...
Belle, why aren't you in bed?
What happened?
W-where's mother?
You mean... you don't remember?
Remember what, father?
I...
No.
Rumple?
- Belle.
- Hey, I've been...
Been looking all over the house for you.
Didn't even hear you leave.
Well, I didn't want to wake you.
Just a few things to take care of before we open.
Well, whatever it is, it'll have to wait.
Emma called.
She needs to see us right away.
Give it back, Kevin.
The camera is Emma's, not yours.
Emma, that's you.
You must be... 13, maybe 14.
Are you missing the part where she's with the snow queen?
Emma, you knew her before you came to Storybrooke?
Apparently my run-in with her in town wasn't the only memory she erased.
All this time in this foster home, or whatever that place was... it's gone.
Look, I-I just don't understand how she even ended up in this world.
We were hoping gold could tell us that.
You spent more time trying to get here than anyone.
How the hell did she do it?
Considering the time I spent on the same task,
I'd love to know.
Does it really matter how she got to Emma?
I mean, shouldn't we be more concerned about why?
Obviously, she needed her for something.
But what?
Well, that's our next problem.
Well, we know she's hiding somewhere in the north woods.
We combed every inch of her shop.
We tore apart her house.
She must have cleared everything out days before.
Which means she must be hiding something.
But where?
What about her ice-cream truck?
Whoa, snow queen has an ice-cream truck?
I'm a kid.
I notice these kind of things.
Then we split up into groups.
We search the town, the woods.
Hook, Regina, Emma, you take the west.
Gold, you're with me for the east.
I think we all know I work best alone.
Well, no time to argue that.
Belle, how are you at tracking?
Uh, actually, I-I think I'll be more helpful at the library.
Maybe I can dig something up on the snow queen.
I'd like to come with you, Belle, if that's okay.
Maybe something about my sister will be there, too.
Unless you'd rather not have the company?
No, n-not at all.
I would love some.
It's late.
You should be in bed.
How can I possibly sleep when I can't even remember what happened to mother?
Perhaps that's for the best.
No!
I need to know what happened to her after I blacked out.
You won't find the answers you seek in the pages of a book.
But I already have, father.
According to this, there are creatures who can restore memories that have been lost.
If we journey to them, maybe they can help me remember what happened to mother.
I can't allow you to do that.
Why not?
Because there's something this book doesn't tell you.
Magic always comes with a price.
And whatever that price is,
I don't want you to have to pay it.
I'm sorry, Belle, but I've already lost your mother to this infernal ogres war.
I can't lose you, too.
- But father...
- You heard me!
No, no!
Forget this nonsense!
You are not to leave this chamber until the doctors say you're better!
I'm sorry, father, but I need to know what happened.
And this...
Is the only place where I'll find the answer.
Arendelle.
There doesn't seem to be anything on Arendelle here.
Do you know where to look?
No, I'm...
I'm sorry.
I'm...
I'm really not that familiar with Arendelle, o-or... or your sister.
Elsa?
Anna!
Oh!
Oh, I was worried I'd never see you again.
I'm afraid you're stuck with me.
I'm sorry I left without telling you.
Oh, and I'm sorry I made you feel like you had to.
I know you did it for me, to try to make me feel better.
So, what did you learn?
Did you discover why our parents went to the enchanted forest?
What is it, Anna?
What did you find?
Nothing.
I mean, I'm still waiting on some answers from a few people I met, but I wouldn't expect anything anytime soon because they have to find it out, then get on a ship and come here.
It could take a while, a long while, and...
Wait, no flurries?
No frost on the windows?
Usually a conversation about our parents ends with a chill in the air.
I've been learning to control my powers when I get upset.
Really?
How?
By training with me.
Who is that?
I mean, who are you?
I-I mean...
Hi.
She's our aunt.
Our what?
Your aunt.
My name is Ingrid.
Your mother and I were sisters.
You look exactly like her.
But our mother doesn't have a sister.
At least, she never told us about one.
I'm sure it was too painful for her to talk about.
You see, many years ago,
I was trapped in a magical urn by...
People who didn't exactly understand me.
Didn't understand you?
Our gift runs in the family.
I'm telling you, that woman is up to something.
What, you mean your aunt?
What makes you think that?
'Cause it's weird and strange, her being here.
And because I'm a good judge of character.
Yeah, says the girl who agreed to marry hans 10 minutes after you started talking to him.
I was young and naive.
You met me the next day.
Young-er.
Anyway, I just want to make sure we're asking all the right questions.
- Like what?
- Like, is she really even my aunt, or is she just some imposter trying to worm her way into our family?
Anna, look at her.
You can't see the resemblance?
Oh, yes, the ice-power thing, there's that.
Maybe, but if she's really my aunt, why isn't she in the family portraits, the royal records?
There's no trace of her.
It's like she never even existed.
There has to be an explanation for all this.
Yeah?
And how do you think you're gonna find it?
Your family.
Careful.
Grand Pabbie's still a little miffed that you postponed the wedding.
I can handle grand Pabbie.
Will you go back to the castle and cover for me... watch Elsa while I'm gone?
If it'll put your mind at ease, of course.
Oh, but, Kristoff, you have to be careful what you say around her.
I...
Might not...
I might not exactly have told her what I discovered in the enchanted forest.
You lied to her?
Ohh, I didn't lie.
I just... withheld the truth.
Telling her our parents wanted to take away her magic...
I just have to find the right moment.
That's all.
Right, right.
Of course.
Yeah.
You know I'll support you no matter what.
Unless I think it's really dumb.
Then I'll tell you.
Thank goodness I haven't hit "really dumb" yet.
Can I get you supplies for your journey?
You're sweet, but no.
I'll stop by oaken's on the way.
You'll see me as soon as I return.
David, call off the search party.
We found the truck near the merry men's camp.
Thanks for keeping an eye out.
Gladly.
You're the first sheriff I don't mind assisting.
Uh, Regina, I was hoping we could talk.
Um, in case you haven't noticed,
I'm about to storm an evil ice-cream truck.
You could have just said, "maybe later."
I know you're trying to make everything better, but staying out of it is your best bet.
It's bad enough I'm stuck with you and captain guy-liner making eyes at each other.
I don't make eyes.
Ready, love?
It appears she beat us to it.
She's cleared out the vessel.
What now?
Should we question the cows she gets her milk from?
Maybe search the waffle-cone factory?
Hang on.
Look.
Who locks their freezer?
Was she afraid someone was gonna steal the Rocky road?
Stand back.
Looks like the dairy queen's been following me for a long time.
Since before foster care?
Since I landed in this world.
Are you okay?
This is pointless.
I don't know why I thought
I'd find anything about Anna in here.
You know she's somewhere.
You know she's alive.
You heard her heartbeat with Bo-peep's staff, right?
But if what the snow queen told me is true and Anna is the one who put me in that urn, then maybe she doesn't want me to find her.
That's not true, Elsa.
You're just saying that to make me feel better.
No, I promise you, I'm not.
How would you know what my sister thinks?
You've never even met her.
Well, just from what you've been saying,
I-I feel like I know her.
You two were very close.
Something must have pulled you apart... something beyond your control.
But my memories are gone, and no one in this town has even been to Arendelle.
I need to face the truth, Belle.
No one here can help me, and I'm afraid that means I might never see Anna again.
Okay.
You will.
I know it.
Now, keep looking.
I'll be back.
What?
Where are you going?
There's something I-I need to take care of.
We will find Anna.
You want to find trolls?
You know they're dangerous, yeah?
Oh, no, no, no.
Rock trolls, not bridge trolls.
Oh, yeah, they're quite nice.
So, you can... - you can direct me to them?
No.
I've never met them.
Yoo-hoo!
But y-you just said they were nice.
I've heard.
Please help me.
I-I just lost my mother.
Oh, I'm...
I'm so sorry.
Uh, trolls can't bring life.
But I can help soothe you.
Have you tried the sauna?
Uh, no, no.
Thank you.
Need some help?
Uh, well, I was trying to find my way to the rock trolls, but this map is not being too helpful.
Oaken means well.
- Yeah!
- But you don't need him or a map.
I can help you.
I'm on my way to see them.
Come with me.
Really?
Thank you.
Uh, I'm Belle.
I'm Anna.
Friend of Anna's?
Half price on the sauna.
I can't help but think you're avoiding me.
Well, not very well, it seems.
You're upset because of what I said... that I'm still in love with you.
I suppose I should never have told you, not after I asked you to find a way to save my wife.
That's not why I'm avoiding you.
Then why can't you even look me in the eye?
Because I don't know how to tell you the truth.
You know you can tell me anything.
I've read every spell book in my possession, experimented with every potion in my vault.
I even tried to defeat the snow queen so I could force her to reverse the spell.
But...
Nothing I do seems good enough.
But it will be, Regina.
I have faith in you.
You will figure out a way eventually.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm not sure I can figure it out.
Robin, I'm sorry, but if you truly want to save Marian...
You're gonna have to forget about me...
And...
Find a way...
To fall in love with your wife again.
You can show yourself, dearie.
I'm not the one you're hiding from.
No, you're not.
To what do I owe this intrusion?
A warning.
Emma Swan is onto you.
She knows your history began long before you came to Storybrooke.
I'm aware.
Do you really think she would have discovered that if I hadn't wanted her to?
It's all part of my plan... a plan you thankfully know little about.
You're being awfully secretive.
You didn't come to warn me.
You came to find out my secrets.
Or offer up a deal.
Whatever suits you best.
But if you decline, I'd be careful.
There it is.
There's the warning.
You want something out of me?
Why don't you just ask for it?
If I wanted something out of you, dearie, believe me, I'd take it.
But you can't, can you?
Otherwise you would.
You and I both know...
to get what you want, you need one thing that I have and you're sorely lacking... leverage.
And until you get that...
I have a warning for you.
Stay out of my way.
Don't worry, Anna.
I'll find you.
So, Belle...
I couldn't help overhearing...
Well, actually, I could, but I'm naturally curious.
Anyway...
I heard you lost your mother.
Yes, in the... in the ogres war.
I'm so sorry.
I lost mine, too.
There are no words.
No, there aren't, especially when you don't know what happened.
I was hoping the rock trolls could restore my memory so that I can finally be at peace.
Sometimes the answer isn't what you want.
Which is what?
One that makes you feel better.
But if grand Pabbie can help you get what you need,
I'll make sure he does.
Thank you.
Uh...
So, now what?
Now we climb.
Okay.
Okay.
You okay?
- Ohh.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Whoo!
Oh!
Kristoff makes this look easy!
Here.
Careful!
Careful.
Why?
W-what's inside?
A hat which can strip the magic from the most powerful of sorcerers.
Why do you have such a thing?
I sort of stole it from an evil sorcerer when I was back in the enchanted forest.
I went to him to help with my sister, but things didn't exactly go according to plan.
Why?
What...
what happened?
Who... who is this person?
I-I'd really rather not get into it.
The less you know, the better.
I just pray you never cross paths with that twisted man.
Belle.
Where are you headed?
To the north woods, where the snow queen's hiding.
And what business do you have with her?
I have to fix a mistake that I made a long time ago.
What are you talking about?
I'm afraid I can't tell you.
You wouldn't understand.
Whether or not that's true, the fact remains that she defeated both Emma and Regina.
She is far more dangerous than you realize.
I know.
That's why I was...
I was hoping you'd come with me.
I'm sorry, Belle.
That's out of the question.
I won't let you anywhere near her.
I was worried you were gonna say that.
Because...
I really...
Really didn't want to do this.
Bell, I gave you that dagger because I trusted you... because I thought you would never want to control me.
I know.
I know, and I'm so, so sorry, rumple.
But if you won't come with me willingly, what choice do I have?
Take me to the snow queen.
According to this, she was my foster parent for six months.
Aye?
That's the longest I was ever in one spot, but I don't remember a second of it.
You all right, Swan?
I'm fine.
It was all a long time ago.
Mm, perhaps, but wounds that are made when we're young
- tend to linger.
- How would you know?
Believe it or not, I was once a child.
Yeah, like a million years ago.
It was more like 200.
What is it?
It's a painting I did when I was in school.
That so surprising?
It's not the only one.
This crazy woman has a whole file of my old art projects and essays.
Just like the one I have for Henry.
You don't keep stuff like this unless you care about someone.
Well, perhaps the snow queen wasn't simply using you.
Perhaps she'd grown fond of you over time.
Looks like the feeling was mutual.
"Thanks for being the family I never had."
"Love, Emma."
I wrote that to her.
Looks like you two were close once.
But she still erased my memories.
Something must have happened to change all that.
There has to be a clue as to why.
Perhaps there is...
If you can read hieroglyphs.
This isn't from our world.
What the hell was she doing with me?
This is it?
This is where she's hiding?
Indeed.
But she's not at home.
I don't sense her magic.
Good.
Okay.
You stay here as lookout.
I'm going in.
No, Belle, y-you're not going in there alone.
Look, I won't be long.
I just need to find something.
What could you possibly want from the snow queen's cave?
A hat... one that can strip a magical being of their powers.
That sounds like a remarkable object... almost too good to be true, which means it probably is.
It isn't, and I know she has it, and I need to get it from her.
It's the only way to force her to tell us where Anna is.
So this is about Elsa's sister?
Why are you so invested in a girl you've never even met?
Because a hero always helps strangers.
Now keep watch.
I'll call out to you if I need your help.
Grand Pabbie?
Grand Pabbie, it's me!
Ooh, Anna, my dear, you're back!
Have you come to tell us the new wedding date?
I have been working on my speech.
Not yet, but we can get into that later.
First, I want you to meet my friend Belle.
She's come a long way to see you.
It's an honor to meet you.
I'm, uh...
I'm here because I-I...
I know.
I can help you get the memories of your mother.
Take this to the place where you lost your memory, then brew a tea with the stone in the kettle.
When you drink it, your memories will return.
Thank you.
Thank you, Anna.
I-I owe you, as well.
How can I repay you?
You don't have to.
Having a new friend is payment enough.
All I need is a moment alone with Pabbie.
I'll be quick.
What can I help you with, dear?
Some woman claims to be my aunt.
I just don't believe her!
Mother would have told us if she had a sister.
Actually, she had two sisters.
Wait.
What?
Mother had two sisters that she never spoke about?
Why didn't she say anything?
Why didn't you say anything?
Because I was sworn to secrecy.
Grand Pabbie, I need some answers.
Please.
Your mother, Gerda, was the youngest of three.
And then there was Helga, and Ingrid was the oldest.
As children, the three girls were quite close, often seen playing together in the royal gardens.
But then, one day, Helga and Ingrid vanished.
No one ever knew what happened to them.
It was a tragedy the royal family wanted to forget.
And they did, with my help.
You took the memories of everyone in Arendelle?
Yes.
And the royal family erased mention of Helga and Ingrid from every book and record they could find in our realm.
Why wouldn't Ingrid tell me what happened, or that she had another sister?
Those are questions you'd have to ask your aunt.
Like she would tell me.
If she's keeping these secrets, who knows what else she's hiding.
I have to warn Elsa.
Belle, we have to go!
What?
Is everything okay?
I don't think so.
It's my aunt.
She's up to something.
The hat must be in here somewhere.
Belle.
Belle.
Belle!
Over here, Belle.
Over here, Belle.
Over...
Here.
Hello, Belle!
I was hoping you'd find me.
I wish I didn't have to wait to use this.
You'll be home before you know it.
As soon as we get to town, we'll put you on the first ship back to the enchanted forest.
If any ships are even setting sail.
It...
Looks like a storm's setting in.
I don't think it's a storm.
Well, what else could it be?
My aunt.
I don't think my aunt wants me to tell my sister what I found out.
Well, if she... has all this magic and...
And you have, well, g-good intentions, then what are we gonna do?
I have more than good intentions!
I have this!
She can't hurt us if she doesn't have magic.
Belle!
Belle!
I can't pull myself up!
Just hold on!
I'll be right there!
Belle, hurry!
Please!
Oh!
Belle, hurry!
I'm coming!
I'm coming.
Anna!
Leave her alone!
You'll have to excuse us, but this is family business.
I'm surprised you were brave enough to come in here.
I had to.
I have to find a way to help Anna.
Why?
You never really cared much for her before.
That's not true.
Sure, it is.
You chose that rock over her.
You had to remember what happened to your mother, no matter what the cost.
I made a mistake.
I didn't mean to...
Ruin someone's life?
It certainly wasn't your most heroic moment.
Not that you've ever really been hero material.
No, please... please stop.
Everyone sees you for what you really are, Belle... a pathetic coward.
I mean, why do you think the dark one married you?
You think it was love?
He needed someone weak, someone he could manipulate.
That's not true.
He loves me.
He gave me this.
You truly believe that's real?
Deep down, you know what kind of beast you're dealing with.
Belle!
Belle.
The snow queen's approaching the cave.
Belle.
Look at me.
Don't look in the mirror.
Look at me.
We have to leave.
Let me go!
- You don't know what you're doing.
- No!
- Please, let me go!
- It's okay.
- Let...
let me go!
- It's okay.
We're back in the shop.
- We're back in the shop.
It's okay.
- No, no!
- It's okay.
- Wait.
No.
You were outside the cave.
I commanded that you wait there.
You commanded me to keep watch.
I sensed she was coming back.
I came to find you, and I'm glad I did.
I...
I hurt you.
I...
I'm so sorry, rumple.
It's okay.
When I f-found that mirror, something came over me, like a...
like a spell.
And... and it spoke to me and made me... made me believe all these horrible things, and it said to me that the dagger you gave me is fake.
I can assure you that nothing that mirror said is true.
It was imbued with the darkest of magic.
I-I know you would never wrong me.
I have wronged you.
I've kept a terrible secret from you.
I'm the reason... that Anna's missing.
I didn't want anyone to know until I could make things right and save Anna.
But I couldn't.
I failed.
And all I managed to do was abuse the dagger and... and take advantage of you, my true love.
I-I don't even know if I... if I deserve to be with you anymore.
No, no, no.
You were only doing what you thought was right.
You... you forgive me?
Of course I forgive you.
Thank you for telling me everything.
Thank you for understanding.
I never should have kept a secret from you, especially 'cause I know that you'd never keep one from me.
I love you, rumple.
And I love you, too.
Father, I...
I-I thought you'd be asleep.
I haven't slept in days.
How could I when you left without so much as a goodbye?
So, did you find what you were looking for?
No.
You were right, father.
I should have just left things alone.
That trip was a huge mistake.
I'm the one who's made the mistake, Belle.
I've been keeping a secret from you.
I know what happened during the ogre attack.
Wait, what?
!
I didn't want to add to your grief.
When the ogres stormed the library where you and your mother had been working, the guards heard the commotion.
They rushed in.
They saw the ogres were about to attack.
But your mother, she... she stood in the path of those monsters to protect you.
She kept them at bay while the guards pulled you from danger.
But by the time they came to save your mother...
It was too late.
She sacrificed herself for me.
She loved you so much, and so do I.
I'm so glad you're back.
I don't know what I would have done if the ogres had gotten you on the road.
They... they have reached the roads?
The war is not going well.
But you need not worry of such things.
We have soldiers to fight.
But those soldiers don't stand a chance.
They'll only slow down the ogres' advance.
We need someone who can stop them once and for all.
And who would that be?
On my journey, I did some reading.
And, well...
There's a wizard, a powerful, powerful wizard, who may just help us.
- His name is...
- I know his name!
And I dare not speak it.
Trust me, Belle, if we do...
I know.
Magic always comes with a price.
But if mother's death taught me anything, it's that sometimes a hero has to sacrifice everything to save the people they love, and I will do whatever I can to save our land.
And I can be a hero, just like mother.
And if that means summoning Rumplestiltskin...
Then so be it.
I'm afraid we have a problem, dearie.
I caught a glimpse of your mirror today.
It's rather impressive, isn't it?
I had no idea your bride would be so easy to turn.
Watch yourself.
Now, I don't know exactly when you intend to use this mirror, but you should know this.
I won't allow you to hurt those I care about.
And I won't allow you to derail my plans because you've suddenly gotten sentimental.
You only get one warning.
Which is more than you get.
I can't make any promises over who may or who may not survive.
You know, you were wrong before.
That you needed leverage to get what you want?
No, that I didn't have it.
I do.
Where did you get that?
Oh, that's irrelevant.
But now that I know what you're up to, we can have a real talk.
You might want to reconsider your position, because I doubt you'd enjoy becoming just another embroidery on this hat.
Looks like you've just lost your leverage, dearie.
Anna.
It's time to wake up, dear.
What?
Where am I?
Exactly where you belong.
You can't just lock me in here!
Elsa won't stand for it!
Even when she finds out what you were planning to do to her?
Wait.
What?
You were planning to use this to strip away her magic.
No, that's not why I had it.
Really?
Then why didn't you tell Elsa about it?
Because I-I didn't know how to tell her the truth.
I found it with a man that our parents sought out.
They went to him looking for a way to strip Elsa of the thing that makes her special.
And you're following in their footsteps.
I wasn't going to use it on her.
I wasn't going to use it on anybody...
Until you attacked me.
The rock trolls told me what you've been hiding, that you and my mother had another sister.
The rock trolls shouldn't talk about things that they don't understand.
But it's true.
What happened to her?
Some secrets are better left buried.
I don't understand.
What do you want?
!
What I have always wanted... a family who will embrace me for who I am.
For a brief moment,
I thought the three of us could be that family... you, me, and Elsa.
But you showed me that plan would never work.
You have nothing in common with Elsa and me.
You are the odd woman out.
And now I suppose I have to find someone else to take your place.
The snow queen is your aunt?
According to this heraldry book I found in the library.
Her name is Ingrid.
I didn't even know my mother had any sisters.
I'm as surprised as you are.
Well, spend a little more time in this town, love, you'll realize just about everyone's related.
This book traces the lineage in Arendelle for generations.
That's gerda, my mother.
And this is Helga, my other aunt.
Bloody hell.
Look at this one...
she looks just like you.
Maybe that's why she was so obsessed with you, why she kept all those relics from your childhood.
She came to this world looking for blondes?
There's a lot more than just me.
Don't I know it.
She wasn't looking for a blonde.
She was looking for the savior.
What?
This scroll... the writing is runic.
It's a prophecy.
It says, "the name of the savior is Emma."
She knew?
Before you even did.
She knew you were powerful.
But why?
It says it right here...
"And the savior shall become Ingrid's sister."
What the hell does that mean?
Well, my mother died, and her other sister... she's not around anymore.
I think Ingrid believes in this prophecy.
I think she's looking to replace them.
Elsa.
Yes.
I...
I'm sorry.
I am so, so sorry, but...
What?
I-I've been keeping a secret.
I know your sister, Anna.
She helped me once.
But when I had a chance to help her, I let her down.
And because I did, she was captured by the snow queen.
What?
Where did this happen?
When?
Arendelle... a long, long time ago.
And I have no idea where she is now.
But, uh, I'm afraid we have a more pressing concern.
The snow queen has a mirror imbued with terrible magic that can do terrible things.
Mirror?
Easy enough, let's just go smash it.
It's not that simple.
Rumple told me it's part of an awful spell... the spell of shattered sight.
If she casts it, its magic will make everyone in Storybrooke turn on one another.
Bloody hell.
The entire town will destroy itself.
And there'd be no one left.
Except us.
What makes you think that she'd spare you and Elsa?
Because of this.
She wants it to be just the three of us.
Her perfect family.
NARRATOR:
Previously on Once Upon A Time...
Marian!
So how do we break the spell?
REGINA:
True love's kiss.
There's a reason that kiss didn't work.
I'm in love with someone else.
REGINA:
She's still your wife.
Soon, I will have what I want.
A family that loves me.
The wall, it's fallen.
We must leave now.
The town will soon be overrun.
These books are too valuable to leave to those monsters.
My lady, please.
Take these trunks to the carriage.
I'll be just behind you.
- And your daughter?
- I will find her.
Now go.
Darling, we must leave, quickly.
- Where are you?
- BELLE:
I'm right here, Mother.
I'm sorry, but I couldn't leave without this.
(RUMBLING)
It's the first story you ever read to me, remember?
It's what made me fall in love with books.
Of course I remember, my Belle.
Quickly, we must flee before...
- (RUMBLING) - (GASPS)
They're here.
We will hide till they pass.
(BOTH PANTING)
- (THUDDING) - (BOTH GASP)
(OGRE GROWLING)
Ogres.
Ripped By mstoll
Shh.
It's going to be all right.
- (BOTH SCREAM) - (ROARING)
(GASPS)
Mother!
(INDISTINCT WHISPERING)
Belle, why aren't you in bed?
What happened?
Where's Mother?
You mean, you don't remember?
Remember what, Father?
I... (BELLE GASPS)
No.
BELLE:
Rumple?
Belle.
Hey.
I've been looking all over the house for you.
Didn't even hear you leave.
I didn't want to wake you.
Just a few things to take care of before we open.
Well, whatever it is, it'll have to wait.
Emma called.
She needs to see us right away.
Give it back, Kevin.
The camera is Emma's, not yours.
Emma, that's you.
You must be...
Thirteen, maybe 14.
Are you missing the part where she's with the Snow Queen?
Emma, you knew her before you came to Storybrooke?
Apparently, my run-in with her in town wasn't the only memory she erased.
All this time in this foster home, or whatever that place was, it's gone.
Look, I just don't understand how she even ended up in this world.
We were hoping Gold could tell us that.
You spent more time trying to get here than anyone.
How the hell did she do it?
Considering the time I spent on the same task, I'd love to know.
Does it really matter how she got to Emma?
I mean, shouldn't we be more concerned about why?
Obviously, she needed her for something.
But what?
Well, that's our next problem.
DAVID:
Well, we know she's hiding somewhere in the North Woods.
We combed every inch of her shop, we tore apart her house.
She must have cleared everything out days before.
Which means she must be hiding something.
But where?
What about her ice-cream truck?
Whoa.
Snow Queen has an ice-cream truck?
I'm a kid.
I notice these kind of things.
Then we split up into groups, we search the town, the woods.
Hook, Regina, Emma, you take the west.
Gold, you're with me for the east.
I think we all know I work best alone.
No time to argue that.
Belle, how are you at tracking?
Uh, actually, I think I'll be more helpful at the library.
Maybe I can dig something up on the Snow Queen.
I'd like to come with you, Belle, if that's okay.
Maybe something about my sister will be there, too.
Unless, you'd rather not have the company.
No, not at all.
I would love some.
It's late.
You should be in bed.
How can I possibly sleep when I can't even remember what happened to Mother?
Perhaps that's for the best.
No!
I need to know what happened to her after I blacked out.
You won't find the answers you seek in the pages of a book.
But I already have, Father.
According to this, there are creatures who can restore memories that have been lost.
If we journey to them, maybe they can help me remember what happened to Mother.
I can't allow you to do that.
Why not?
Because there's something this book doesn't tell you.
Magic always comes with a price.
And whatever that price is, I don't want you to have to pay it.
I'm sorry, Belle.
I've already lost your mother to this infernal Ogres' War.
I can't lose you, too.
- But, Father, I don't know...
- You heard me!
Forget this nonsense.
You are not to leave this chamber until the doctors say you're better.
(DOOR SLAMS SHUT)
I'm sorry, Father.
But I need to know what happened.
And this is the only place where I'll find the answer.
(READING)
There doesn't seem to be anything on Arendelle here.
Do you know where to look?
No.
I'm sorry.
I'm really not that familiar with Arendelle.
Or your sister.
ANNA:
Elsa?
Anna?
Oh.
I was worried I'd never see you again.
I'm afraid you're stuck with me.
I'm sorry I left without telling you.
And I'm sorry I made you feel like you had to.
I know you did it for me.
To try to make me feel better.
(SIGHS)
So?
What did you learn?
Did you discover why our parents went to the enchanted forest?
What is it, Anna?
What did you find?
Nothing.
I mean, I'm still waiting on some answers from a few people I met.
But I wouldn't expect anything anytime soon.
Because they have to find it out, then get on a ship and come here.
It could take a while.
A long while.
And...
Wait, no flurries?
No frost on the windows?
Usually a conversation about our parents ends with a chill in the air.
I've been learning to control my powers when I get upset.
Really?
How?
INGRID:
By training with me.
ANNA:
Who is that?
I mean, who are you?
I mean, hi.
She's our aunt.
- Our what?
- Your aunt.
My name is Ingrid.
Your mother and I were sisters.
You look exactly like her.
But our mother doesn't have a sister.
At least, she never told us about one.
I'm sure it was too painful for her to talk about.
You see, many years ago, I was trapped in a magical urn by people who didn't exactly understand me.
Didn't understand you?
Our gift runs in the family.
ANNA:
I'm telling you, that woman is up to something.
What, you mean your aunt?
What makes you think that?
Because it's weird.
And strange, her being here.
And because I'm a good judge of character.
Yeah, says the girl who agreed to marry Hans 10 minutes after you started talking to him.
I was young and naive.
You met me the next day.
Younger.
Anyway, I just want to make sure we're asking all the right questions.
Like What?
Like, is she really even my aunt?
Or is she just some impostor who's trying to worm her way into our family?
Anna.
Look at her.
You can't see the resemblance?
Oh, yes, the ice power thing.
There's that.
Maybe.
But if she's really my aunt, why isn't she in the family portraits?
The royal records?
There's no trace of her.
It's like she never even existed.
There has to be an explanation for all this.
Yeah, and how do you think you're going to find it?
Your family.
Careful.
Grand Pabbie's still a little miffed that you postponed the wedding.
I can handle Grand Pabbie.
Will you go back to the castle and cover for me?
Watch Elsa while I'm gone?
If it'll put your mind at ease, of course.
But, Kristoff, you have to be careful what you say around her.
I might not...
I might not exactly have told her what I discovered in the enchanted forest.
You lied to her?
Oh, I didn't lie.
I just withheld the truth.
Telling her our parents wanted to take away her magic?
I just have to find the right moment.
That's all.
Right.
Right.
Of course.
Yeah.
You know I'll support you no matter what.
Unless I think it's really dumb.
Then I'll tell ya.
Thank goodness I haven't hit really dumb yet.
Can I get you supplies for your journey?
You're sweet, but, no.
I'll stop by Oaken's on the way.
You'll see me as soon as I return.
EMMA:
David, call off the search party.
We found the truck near the Merry Men's camp.
Thanks for keeping an eye out.
Gladly.
You're the first sheriff I don't mind assisting.
Uh, Regina, I was hoping we could talk.
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm about to storm an evil ice-cream truck.
You could have just said, "Maybe later."
I know you try to make everything better, but staying out of it is your best bet.
It's bad enough I'm stuck with you and Captain Guy-liner making eyes at each other.
I don't make eyes.
Ready, love?
(SIGHS)
It appears she beat us to it.
She's cleared out the vessel.
What now?
Should we question the cows she gets her milk from?
Maybe search the waffle cone factory?
Hang on.
Look.
Who locks their freezer?
Was she afraid someone was gonna steal the Rocky Road?
Stand back.
It looks like the Dairy Queen's been following me for a long time.
Since before foster care?
Since I landed in this world.
BELLE:
Are you okay?
This is pointless.
I don't know why I thought I'd find anything about Anna in here.
You know she's somewhere.
You know she's alive.
You heard her heartbeat with Bo Peep's staff, right?
But if what the Snow Queen told me is true, and Anna is the one who put me in that urn, then maybe she doesn't want me to find her.
That's not true, Elsa.
You're just saying that to make me feel better.
No, I promise you, I'm not.
How would you know what my sister thinks?
You've never even met her.
Well, just from what you've been saying, I feel like I know her.
You two were very close.
Something must have pulled you apart.
Something beyond your control.
But my memories are gone.
And no one in this town has even been to Arendelle.
I need to face the truth, Belle.
No one here can help me.
And I'm afraid that means I might never see Anna again.
(SIGHS)
Look, you will.
- (SCOFFS)
- I know it.
Now keep looking.
I'll be back.
What?
Where are you going?
There's something I need to take care of.
We will find Anna.
You want to find trolls?
You know they're dangerous, yeah?
Oh, no, no, no.
Rock trolls.
Not bridge trolls.
Oh, yeah, they're quite nice.
So you can...
You can direct me to them?
No.
I've never met them.
- Yoo-hoo.
- But you just said they were nice.
I've heard.
(SIGHS)
Please help me.
I just lost my mother.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Uh, trolls can't bring life.
But I can help soothe you.
Have you tried the sauna?
Uh, no.
No, thank you.
ANNA:
Need some help?
Um...
Well, I was trying to find my way to the rock trolls, but this map is not being too helpful.
Oaken means well.
OAKEN:
Yeah!
But you don't need him.
Or a map.
I can help you.
I'm on my way to see them.
Come with me.
Really?
(CHUCKLES) Thank you.
I'm Belle.
I'm Anna.
Friend of Anna's?
Half price on the sauna!
I can't help but think you're avoiding me.
(SIGHS)
Well, not very well it seems.
You're upset because of what I said.
That I'm still in love with you.
I suppose I should never have told you.
Not after I asked you to find a way to save my wife.
That's not why I'm avoiding you.
Then why can't you even look me in the eye?
Because I don't know how to tell you the truth.
You know you can tell me anything.
I've read every spell book in my possession.
Experimented with every potion in my vault.
I even tried to defeat the Snow Queen so I could force her to reverse the spell.
But nothing I do seems good enough.
But it will be, Regina.
I have faith in you.
You will figure out a way eventually.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm not sure I can figure it out.
Robin, I'm sorry, but if you truly want to save Marian,
you're going to have to forget about me.
And find a way to fall in love with your wife again.
You can show yourself, dearie.
I'm not the one you're hiding from.
No, you're not.
To what do I owe this intrusion?
A warning.
Emma Swan is on to you.
She knows your history began long before you came to Storybrooke.
I'm aware.
Do you really think she would have discovered that if I hadn't wanted her to?
It's all part of my plan.
A plan you thankfully know little about.
You're being awfully secretive.
You didn't come to warn me.
You came to find out my secrets.
Or offer up a deal.
Whatever suits you best.
But if you decline, I'd be careful.
There it is!
There's the warning.
You want something out of me?
Why don't you just ask for it?
If I wanted something out of you, dearie, believe me, I'd take it.
But you can't, can you?
Otherwise, you would.
You and I both know to get what you want, you need one thing that I have and you're sorely lacking.
Leverage.
And until you get that,
I have a warning for you.
Stay out of my way.
Don't worry, Anna.
I'll find you.
So, Belle, I couldn't help overhearing...
Well, actually, I could, but I'm naturally curious.
Anyway, I heard you lost your mother.
Yes.
In the Ogres' War.
I'm so sorry.
I lost mine, too.
There are no words.
No, there aren't.
Especially when you don't know what happened.
I was hoping the rock trolls could restore my memory, so that I can finally be at peace.
Sometimes the answer isn't what you want.
Which is what?
One that makes you feel better.
But if Grand Pabbie can help you get what you need,
I'll make sure he does.
Thank you.
Uh...
So, now what?
Now we climb.
Okay.
(GRUNTS)
Okay.
- (ANNA SCREAMS) - (GASPS)
You okay?
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Whoo.
Kristoff makes this look easy.
Here.
Careful.
Careful.
Why?
What's inside?
A hat which can strip the magic from the most powerful of sorcerers.
Why do you have such a thing?
I sort of stole it from an evil sorcerer when I was back in the enchanted forest.
I went to him to help with my sister, but things didn't exactly go according to plan.
Why?
What...
What happened?
Who is this person?
I'd really rather not get into it.
The less you know, the better.
I just pray you never cross paths with that twisted man.
(BELLS JINGLING)
Belle, where are you headed?
To the North Woods.
Where the Snow Queen's hiding.
And what business do you have with her?
I have to fix a mistake that I made a long time ago.
What are you talking about?
I'm afraid I can't tell you.
You wouldn't understand.
Whether or not that's true, the fact remains that she defeated both Emma and Regina.
She is far more dangerous than you realize.
I know.
That's why I was hoping you'd come with me.
(SCOFFS)
I'm sorry, Belle, that's out of the question.
I won't let you anywhere near her.
I was worried you were going to say that.
Because
I really, really didn't want to do this.
Belle, I gave you that dagger because I trusted you.
Because I thought you would never want to control me.
I know.
I know, and I'm so, so sorry, Rumple.
But if you won't come with me willingly, what choice do I have?
Take me to the Snow Queen.
EMMA:
According to this, she was my foster parent for six months.
Aye?
That's the longest I was ever in one spot.
But I don't remember a second of it.
You all right, Swan?
I'm fine.
It was all a long time ago.
Perhaps, but wounds that are made when we're young tend to linger.
How would you know?
Believe it or not, I was once a child.
Yeah, like a million years ago.
It's more like 200.
What is it?
It's a painting I did when I was in school.
Is that so surprising?
It's not the only one.
This crazy woman has a whole file of my old art projects and essays.
Just like the one I have for Henry.
You don't keep stuff like this unless you care about someone.
Well, perhaps the Snow Queen wasn't simply using you.
Perhaps she'd grown fond of you over time.
Looks like the feeling was mutual.
"Thanks for being the family I never had.
Love, Emma."
I wrote that.
To her.
Looks like you two were close once.
She still erased my memories.
Something must have happened to change all that.
There has to be a clue as to why.
Perhaps there is.
If you can read hieroglyphs.
This isn't from our world.
What the hell was she doing with me?
This is it?
This is where she's hiding?
Indeed.
But she's not at home.
I don't sense her magic.
Good.
Okay, you stay here as lookout.
I'm going in.
Belle, you're not going in there alone.
Look, I won't be long.
I just need to find something.
What could you possibly want from the Snow Queen's cave?
A hat.
One that can strip a magical being of their powers.
Sounds like a remarkable object.
Almost too good to be true.
Which means it probably is.
It isn't and I know she has it.
And I need to get it from her.
It's the only way to force her to tell us where Anna is.
So this is about Elsa's sister?
Why are you so invested in a girl you've never even met?
Because a hero always helps strangers.
Now keep watch.
I'll call out to you if I need your help.
Grand Pabbie?
Grand Pabbie, it's me!
Ooh, Anna, my dear, you're back!
Have you come to tell us the new wedding date?
I have been working on my speech.
Not yet.
But we can get into that later.
First, I want you to meet my friend, Belle.
She's come a long way to see you.
It's an honor to meet you.
I'm here because I...
PABBIE:
I know.
I can help you get the memories of your mother.
Take this to the place where you lost your memory, then brew a tea with the stone in the kettle.
When you drink it, your memories will return.
Thank you.
(BELLE SIGHS)
Thank you, Anna.
I owe you as well.
How can I repay you?
You don't have to.
Having a friend is payment enough.
All I need is a moment alone with Pabbie.
I'll be quick.
PABBIE:
What can I help you with, dear?
ANNA:
Some woman claims to be my aunt.
I just don't believe her.
Mother would have told us if she had a sister.
Actually, she had two sisters.
Wait.
What?
Mother had two sisters?
That she never spoke about?
Why didn't she say anything?
Why didn't you say anything?
Because I was sworn to secrecy.
Grand Pabbie, I need some answers.
Please.
(SIGHS)
Your mother, Gerda, was the youngest of three.
Then there was Helga, and Ingrid was the oldest.
As children, the three girls were quite close, often seen playing together in the royal gardens.
But then, one day, Helga and Ingrid vanished.
No one ever knew what happened to them.
It was a tragedy the royal family wanted to forget.
And they did.
With my help.
You took the memories of everyone in Arendelle?
Yes.
And the royal family erased mention of Helga and Ingrid from every book and record they could find in our realm.
Why wouldn't Ingrid tell me what happened?
Or that she had another sister?
Those are questions you'd have to ask your aunt.
(SIGHS) Like she would tell me.
If she's keeping these secrets, who knows what else she's hiding?
I have to warn Elsa!
Belle!
We have to go.
What?
ls everything okay?
I don't think so.
It's my aunt.
She's up to something.
The hat must be in here somewhere.
FEMALE VOICE:
Belle.
Belle.
Belle!
Over here, Belle.
Over here, Belle.
Over here.
Hello, Belle.
(GASPS)
I was hoping you'd find me.
I wish I didn't have to wait to use this.
You'll be home before you know it.
As soon as we get to town, we'll put you on the first ship back to the enchanted forest.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
If any ships are even setting sail.
It looks like a storm's setting in.
I don't think it's a storm.
Well, what else could it be?
My aunt.
I don't think my aunt wants me to tell my sister what I found out.
Well, if she has all this magic and you have, well, good intentions, then what are we going to do?
I have more than good intentions.
I have this.
She can't hurt us if she doesn't have magic.
- (WIND WHOOSHING) - (BOTH YELP)
(GRUNTS)
ANNA:
Belle!
Belle!
I can't pull myself up.
Just hold on, I'll be right there!
Belle, hurry, please!
Oh!
Belle, hurry!
I'm coming!
I'm coming.
(SCREAMS)
Anna!
Leave her alone!
You'll have to excuse us, but this is family business.
BELLE IN MIRROR:
I'm surprised you were brave enough to come in here.
I had to.
I have to find a way to help Anna.
Why?
You never really cared much for her before.
That's not true.
Sure it is.
You chose that rock over her.
You had to remember what happened to your mother.
No matter what the cost.
I made a mistake.
I didn't mean to...
Ruin someone's life?
Certainly wasn't your most heroic moment.
Not that you've ever really been hero material.
Please!
Please, stop.
Everyone sees you for what you really are, Belle.
A pathetic coward.
I mean, why do you think the Dark One married you?
You think it was love?
He needed someone weak.
Someone he could manipulate.
That's not true.
He loves me.
He gave me this.
(BELLE IN MIRROR LAUGHING)
You truly believe that's real?
Deep down, you know what kind of beast you're dealing with.
GOLD:
Belle.
Belle.
The Snow Queen's approaching the cave.
Belle.
Look at me.
Don't look in the mirror, look at me.
We have to leave.
(GRUNTING) No!
Let me go!
You don't know what you're doing!
No!
- Please, let me go!
- It's okay.
- It's okay.
- Let me go!
We're back in the shop.
- We're back in the shop.
It's okay!
- No!
No!
- It's okay!
- No, you...
No.
You were outside the cave.
I commanded that you wait there.
You commanded me to keep watch.
I sensed she was coming back, I came to find you.
And I'm glad I did.
(CLATTERING)
I hurt you.
(SOBBING)
I'm so sorry, Rumple.
It's okay.
When I found that mirror, something came over me, like a spell.
And it spoke to me, and made me...
Made me believe all these horrible things.
And it said to me that the dagger you gave me is fake.
(SNIFFLES)
I can assure you that nothing that mirror said is true.
It was imbued with the darkest of magic.
I know you would never wrong me.
I have wronged you.
I've kept a terrible secret from you.
I'm the reason that Anna's missing.
I didn't want anyone to know, until I could make things right and save Anna.
But I couldn't.
I failed.
And all I managed to do was abuse the dagger and take advantage of you.
My true love.
I don't even know if I deserve to be with you anymore.
No, no, no.
You were only doing what you thought was right.
You forgive me?
Of course I forgive you.
Thank you for telling me everything.
Thank you for understanding.
I never should've kept a secret from you.
Especially 'cause I know that you'd never keep one from me.
I love you, Rumple.
And I love you, too.
Father, I thought you'd be asleep.
I haven't slept in days.
How could I when you left without so much as a goodbye?
So, did you find what you were looking for?
No.
You were right, Father.
I should've just left things alone.
That trip was a huge mistake.
No.
I'm the one who's made the mistake, Belle.
I've been keeping a secret from you.
I know what happened during the ogre attack.
Wait.
What?
I didn't want to add to your grief.
When the ogres stormed the library where you and your mother had been working, the guards heard the commotion.
They rushed in, they saw the ogres were about to attack.
But your mother, she...
She stood in the path of those monsters to protect you.
She kept them at bay while the guards pulled you from danger.
But by the time they came to save your mother...
It was too late.
She sacrificed herself for me.
She loved you so much.
And so do I.
I'm so glad you're back.
I don't know what I would've done if the ogres had gotten you on the road.
They've reached the roads?
The war is not going well.
But you need not worry of such things.
We have soldiers to fight.
But those soldiers don't stand a chance.
They'll only slow down the ogres' advance.
(SIGHS)
We need someone who can stop them once and for all.
And who would that be?
On my journey, I did some reading.
And, well, there's a wizard.
A powerful, powerful wizard who may just help us.
His name is...
I know his name.
And I dare not speak it.
Trust me, Belle, if we do...
I know.
Magic always comes with a price.
But if Mother's death taught me anything, it's that sometimes a hero has to sacrifice everything to save the people they love.
And I will do whatever I can to save our land.
And I can be a hero, just like Mother.
And if that means summoning Rumplestiltskin, then so be it.
I'm afraid we have a problem, dearie.
I caught a glimpse of your mirror today.
It's rather impressive, isn't it?
I had no idea your bride would be so easy to turn.
Watch yourself.
Now, I don't know exactly when you intend to use this mirror, but you should know this,
I won't allow you to hurt those I care about.
And I won't allow you to derail my plans because you've suddenly gotten sentimental.
You only get one warning.
Which is more than you get.
I can't make any promises over who may or may not survive.
You know, you were wrong before.
That you needed leverage to get what you want?
No, that I didn't have it.
I do.
Where did you get that?
Oh, that's irrelevant.
But now that I know what you're up to, we can have a real talk.
You might wanna reconsider your position.
Because I doubt you'd enjoy becoming just another embroidery on this hat.
Looks like you've just lost your leverage, dearie.
Anna.
It's time to wake up, dear.
What?
Where am I?
Exactly where you belong.
You can't just lock me in here.
Elsa won't stand for it.
Even when she finds out what you were planning to do to her?
Wait.
What?
You were planning to use this to strip away her magic.
No, that's not why I had it.
Really?
Then why didn't you tell Elsa about it?
Because I didn't know how to tell her the truth.
I found it with a man that our parents sought out.
They went to him looking for a way to strip Elsa of the thing that makes her special.
And you're following in their footsteps.
I wasn't going to use it on her.
I wasn't going to use it on anybody, until you attacked me.
The rock trolls told me what you've been hiding.
That you and my mother had another sister.
The rock trolls shouldn't talk about things that they don't understand.
But it's true?
What happened to her?
Some secrets are better left buried.
I don't understand.
What do you want?
What I have always wanted.
A family who will embrace me for who I am.
For a brief moment,
I thought the three of us could be that family.
You, me and Elsa.
But you showed me that plan would never work.
You have nothing in common with Elsa and me.
You are the odd woman out.
And now,
I suppose I have to find someone else to take your place.
The Snow Queen is your aunt?
According to this heraldry book I found in the library.
Her name is Ingrid.
I didn't even know my mother had any sisters.
I'm as surprised as you are.
Well, spend a little more time in this town, love, you'll realize just about everyone's related.
This book traces the lineage in Arendelle for generations.
That's Gerda.
My mother.
And this is Helga, my other aunt.
Bloody hell.
Look at her, Swan.
She looks just like you.
Maybe that's why she was so obsessed with you.
Why she kept all those relics from your childhood.
She came to this world looking for blondes?
There's a lot more than just me.
Don't I know it.
ELSA:
She wasn't looking for a blonde.
She was looking for the Savior.
What?
This scroll, the writing is Runic.
It's a prophecy.
It says, "The name of the Savior is Emma."
She knew?
Before you even did.
She knew you were powerful.
But Why?
It says it right here,
"And the Savior shall become Ingrid's sister."
What the hell does that mean?
Well, my mother died.
And her other sister, she's not around anymore.
I think Ingrid believes in this prophecy.
I think she's looking to replace them.
BELLE:
Elsa.
ELSA:
Yes?
I'm sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.
- But...
- What?
I've been keeping a secret.
I know your sister, Anna.
She helped me once.
But when I had a chance to help her, I let her down.
And because I did, she was captured by the Snow Queen.
What?
Where did this happen?
When?
Arendelle.
Long, long time ago.
And I have no idea where she is now.
But I'm afraid we have a more pressing concern.
The Snow Queen has a mirror, imbued with terrible magic that can do terrible things.
A mirror?
Easy enough.
Let's just go smash it.
It's not that simple.
Rumple told me it's part of an awful spell.
The Spell of Shattered Sight.
If she casts it, its magic will make everyone in Storybrooke turn on one another.
Bloody hell, the entire town will destroy itself.
And there'd be no one left.
Except us.
What makes you think that she'd spare you and Elsa?
Because of this.
She wants it to be just the three of us.
Her perfect family.
Ripped By mstoll
Regina:
True love's kiss.
There's a reason that kiss didn't work.
I'm in love with someone else.
She's still your wife.
Soon I will have what I want.
A family that loves me.
The wall... it's fallen.
We must leave now.
The town will soon be overrun.
These books are too valuable to leave to those monsters.
My lady, please.
Take these trunks to the carriage.
I'll be just behind you.
And your daughter?
I will find her.
Now go.
Darling, we must leave, quickly!
Where are you?
Belle:
I'm right here, mother!
I'm sorry, but I couldn't leave without this.
It's the first story you ever read to me, remember?
It's what made me fall in love with books.
Of course I remember, my belle.
Quickly, we must flee bef... [ rumbling ] [ gasps ]
[ gasps ] they're here.
We will hide till they pass.
[ rumbling ] [ both panting ]
[ thud ] [ both gasp ]
Ogres!
[ growling ]
[ gasps ] shh!
It's going to be all right.
[ both scream ] [ roars ] [ gasps ] mother?
!
M...
Belle, why aren't you in bed?
What happened?
W-where's mother?
You mean...
You don't remember?
Remember what, father?
I... [ gasps ] [ indistinct whispering ] [ exhales sharply ] no.
¶
¶
Rumple?
Belle.
Hey, I've been...
Been looking all over the house for you.
Didn't even hear you leave.
Just a few things to take care of before we open.
Well, whatever it is, it'll have to wait.
Emma called.
She needs to see us right away.
[ sighs ]
Give it back, kevin.
The camera is emma's, not yours.
[ click ]
Emma, that's you.
You must be...
Are you missing the part where she's with the snow queen?
Emma, you knew her before you came to storybrooke?
Apparently my run-in with her in town
Wasn't the only memory she erased.
All this time in this foster home,
Or whatever that place was...
it's gone.
Look, I-I just don't understand
How she even ended up in this world.
We were hoping gold could tell us that.
You spent more time trying to get here than anyone.
Considering the time I spent on the same task,
Does it really matter how she got to emma?
I mean, shouldn't we be more concerned about why?
Obviously, she needed her for something.
But what?
[ scoffs ] well, that's our next problem.
Well, we know she's hiding somewhere in the north woods.
We combed every inch of her shop.
We tore apart her house.
Which means she must be hiding something.
But where?
What about her ice-cream truck?
Whoa, snow queen has an ice-cream truck?
I'm a kid.
I notice these kind of things.
Then we split up into groups.
We search the town, the woods.
Hook, regina, emma, you take the west.
Gold, you're with me for the east.
I think we all know I work best alone.
Well, no time to argue that.
Belle, how are you at tracking?
Uh, actually, I-I think I'll be more helpful at the library.
Maybe I can dig something up on the snow queen.
I'd like to come with you, belle, if that's okay.
Maybe something about my sister will be there, too.
Unless you'd rather not have the company?
No, n-not at all.
I would love some.
It's late.
You should be in bed.
How can I possibly sleep when I can't even remember
What happened to mother?
Perhaps that's for the best.
I need to know what happened to her after I blacked out.
You won't find the answers you seek in the pages of a book.
But I already have, father.
According to this, there are creatures
Who can restore memories that have been lost.
If we journey to them, maybe they can help me remember
What happened to mother.
I can't allow you to do that.
Why not?
Because there's something this book doesn't tell you.
Magic always comes with a price.
And whatever that price is,
I don't want you to have to pay it.
I'm sorry, belle,
But I've already lost your mother
To this infernal ogres war.
I can't lose you, too.
But father...
you heard me!
No, no!
Forget this nonsense!
You are not to leave this chamber
Until the doctors say you're better!
[ door closes ]
I'm sorry, father, but I need to know what happened.
And this...
Is the only place where I'll find the answer.
Arendelle.
There doesn't seem to be anything on arendelle here.
Do you know where to look?
No, I'm...
I'm sorry.
I'm...
I'm really not that familiar with arendelle,
O-or... or your sister.
Elsa?
Anna!
Oh!
Oh, I was worried I'd never see you again.
I'm afraid you're stuck with me.
I'm sorry I left without telling you.
Oh, and I'm sorry I made you feel like you had to.
I know you did it for me, to try to make me feel better.
[ sighs ]
So, what did you learn?
Did you discover why our parents went to the enchanted forest?
What is it, anna?
What did you find?
Nothing.
I mean, I'm still waiting on some answers
From a few people I met,
But I wouldn't expect anything anytime soon
Because they have to find it out,
It could take a while, a long while, and...
Wait, no flurries?
No frost on the windows?
Usually a conversation about our parents ends
With a chill in the air.
I've been learning to control my powers when I get upset.
Really?
How?
By training with me.
Who is that?
I mean, who are you?
I-I mean...
Hi.
She's our aunt.
Our what?
Your aunt.
My name is ingrid.
Your mother and I were sisters.
You look exactly like her.
But our mother doesn't have a sister.
At least, she never told us about one.
I'm sure it was too painful for her to talk about.
You see, many years ago,
I was trapped in a magical urn by...
People who didn't exactly understand me.
Didn't understand you?
[ whoosh ]
Our gift runs in the family.
Anna:
I'm telling you, that woman is up to something.
What, you mean your aunt?
What makes you think that?
'cause it's weird and strange, her being here.
And because I'm a good judge of character.
Yeah, says the girl who agreed to marry hans 10 minutes after you started talking to him.
I was young and naive.
You met me the next day.
Young-er.
Anyway, I just want to make sure
We're asking all the right questions.
Like what?
Like, is she really even my aunt,
Or is she just some imposter
Trying to worm her way into our family?
Anna, look at her.
You can't see the resemblance?
Oh, yes, the ice-power thing, there's that.
Maybe, but if she's really my aunt,
Why isn't she in the family portraits,
The royal records?
There's no trace of her.
It's like she never even existed.
There has to be an explanation for all this.
Yeah?
And how do you think you're gonna find it?
Your family.
Grand pabbie's still a little miffed
That you postponed the wedding.
I can handle grand pabbie.
Will you go back to the castle and cover for me...
Watch elsa while I'm gone?
If it'll put your mind at ease, of course.
You have to be careful what you say around her.
I...
Might not...
I might not exactly have told her
What I discovered in the enchanted forest.
You lied to her?
Ohh, I didn't lie.
I just...
Withheld the truth.
Telling her our parents wanted to take away her magic I just have to find the right moment.
That's all.
Right, right.
Of course.
Yeah.
You know I'll support you no matter what.
Unless I think it's really dumb.
Thank goodness I haven't hit "really dumb" yet.
Can I get you supplies for your journey?
You're sweet, but no.
I'll stop by oaken's on the way.
You'll see me as soon as I return.
Emma:
David, call off the search party.
We found the truck near the merry men's camp.
Thanks for keeping an eye out.
You're the first sheriff I don't mind assisting.
Uh, regina, I was hoping we could talk.
Um, in case you haven't noticed,
I'm about to storm an evil ice-cream truck.
You could have just said, "maybe later."
I know you're trying to make everything better,
But staying out of it is your best bet.
It's bad enough I'm stuck with you and captain guy-liner
Making eyes at each other.
I don't make eyes.
Ready, love?
[ sighs ]
It appears she beat us to it.
She's cleared out the vessel.
Should we question the cows she gets her milk from?
Maybe search the waffle-cone factory?
Hang on.
Look.
Who locks their freezer?
Was she afraid someone was gonna steal the rocky road?
Stand back.
Looks like the dairy queen's
Been following me for a long time.
Since before foster care?
Since I landed in this world.
Belle:
Are you okay?
This is pointless.
I don't know why I thought
I'd find anything about anna in here.
You know she's somewhere.
You know she's alive.
You heard her heartbeat with bo-peep's staff, right?
But if what the snow queen told me is true
And anna is the one who put me in that urn,
Then maybe she doesn't want me to find her.
You're just saying that to make me feel better.
No, I promise you, I'm not.
How would you know what my sister thinks?
You've never even met her.
Well, just from what you've been saying,
I-I feel like I know her.
You two were very close.
Something must have pulled you apart...
Something beyond your control.
[ voice breaking ] but my memories are gone,
And no one in this town has even been to arendelle.
I need to face the truth, belle.
No one here can help me,
And I'm afraid that means I might never see anna again.
[ sighs ] okay.
You will.
[ scoffs ]
I know it.
Now, keep looking.
I'll be back.
What?
Where are you going?
There's something I-I need to take care of.
We will find anna.
You want to find trolls?
You know they're dangerous, yeah?
Oh, no, no, no.
Rock trolls, not bridge trolls.
Oh, yeah, they're quite nice.
So, you can...
you can direct me to them?
No.
I've never met them.
But y-you just said they were nice.
I've heard.
[ sighs ]
Please help me.
I-I just lost my mother.
Oh, I'm...
I'm so sorry.
Uh, trolls can't bring life.
But I can help soothe you.
Have you tried the sauna?
Uh, no, no.
Thank you.
Anna:
Need some help?
Uh, well, I was trying to find my way to the rock trolls,
But this map is not being too helpful.
Oaken means well.
Yeah!
But you don't need him or a map.
I'm on my way to see them.
Come with me.
Really?
[ laughing ] thank you.
Uh, I'm belle.
I'm anna.
Friend of anna's?
Half price on the sauna.
I can't help but think you're avoiding me.
[ sighs ]
Well, not very well, it seems.
You're upset because of what I said...
That I'm still in love with you.
I suppose I should never have told you,
Not after I asked you to find a way to save my wife.
That's not why I'm avoiding you.
Then why can't you even look me in the eye?
Because I don't know how to tell you the truth.
You know you can tell me anything.
I've read every spell book in my possession,
Experimented with every potion in my vault.
I even tried to defeat the snow queen
So I could force her to reverse the spell.
But...
Nothing I do seems good enough.
But it will be, regina.
I have faith in you.
You will figure out a way eventually.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm not sure I can figure it out.
Robin, I'm sorry,
But if you truly want to save marian...
You're gonna have to forget about me...
And...
Find a way...
To fall in love with your wife again.
You can show yourself, dearie.
I'm not the one you're hiding from.
No, you're not.
To what do I owe this intrusion?
A warning.
Emma swan is onto you.
She knows your history began
Long before you came to storybrooke.
I'm aware.
Do you really think she would have discovered that
If I hadn't wanted her to?
It's all part of my plan...
A plan you thankfully know little about.
You're being awfully secretive.
You didn't come to warn me.
You came to find out my secrets.
Or offer up a deal.
Whatever suits you best.
But if you decline, I'd be careful.
There it is.
There's the warning.
You want something out of me?
Why don't you just ask for it?
If I wanted something out of you, dearie,
Believe me, I'd take it.
But you can't, can you?
Otherwise you would.
You and I both know...
to get what you want,
You need one thing that I have and you're sorely lacking...
Leverage.
And until you get that...
I have a warning for you.
Stay out of my way.
[ breathing heavily ]
Don't worry, anna.
I'll find you.
So, belle...
Well, actually, I could, but I'm naturally curious.
Anyway...
I heard you lost your mother.
Yes, in the...
in the ogres war.
I'm so sorry.
I lost mine, too.
There are no words.
[ sighs ] no, there aren't,
Especially when you don't know what happened.
I was hoping the rock trolls could restore my memory
So that I can finally be at peace.
Sometimes the answer isn't what you want.
Which is what?
One that makes you feel better.
But if grand pabbie can help you get what you need,
I'll make sure he does.
Thank you.
Uh...
So, now what?
Now we climb.
Okay.
[ grunts ] [ laughs ]
Belle:
Okay.
[ screams ] [ gasps ]
You okay?
Ohh.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Whoo!
Oh!
Kristoff makes this look easy!
[ sighs ]
Here.
Careful!
Careful.
Why?
W-what's inside?
A hat which can strip the magic
From the most powerful of sorcerers.
Why do you have such a thing?
I sort of stole it from an evil sorcerer
When I was back in the enchanted forest.
[ sighs ] I went to him to help with my sister,
But things didn't exactly go according to plan.
Why?
What...
what happened?
Who...
who is this person?
I-I'd really rather not get into it.
The less you know, the better.
I just pray you never cross paths with that twisted man.
[ door bells jingle ] [ door closes ] where are you headed?
To the north woods, where the snow queen's hiding.
And what business do you have with her?
I have to fix a mistake that I made a long time ago.
What are you talking about?
I'm afraid I can't tell you.
You wouldn't understand.
Whether or not that's true,
The fact remains that she defeated both emma and regina.
She is far more dangerous than you realize.
I know.
That's why I was...
I was hoping you'd come with me.
[ scoffs ] I'm sorry, belle.
That's out of the question.
I won't let you anywhere near her.
I was worried you were gonna say that.
Because...
I really...
Really didn't want to do this.
Bell, I gave you that dagger because I trusted you Because I thought you would never want to control me.
I know.
I know, and I'm so, so sorry, rumple.
But if you won't come with me willingly,
What choice do I have?
Take me to the snow queen.
She was my foster parent for six months.
Aye?
That's the longest I was ever in one spot,
But I don't remember a second of it.
I'm fine.
It was all a long time ago.
Mm, perhaps, but wounds that are made when we're young
Tend to linger.
How would you know?
Believe it or not, I was once a child.
Yeah, like a million years ago.
It was more like 200.
What is it?
It's a painting I did when I was in school.
That so surprising?
It's not the only one.
This crazy woman has a whole file
Of my old art projects and essays.
Just like the one I have for henry.
You don't keep stuff like this
Unless you care about someone.
Well, perhaps the snow queen wasn't simply using you.
Perhaps she'd grown fond of you over time.
Looks like the feeling was mutual.
"thanks for being the family I never had.
Love, emma."
I wrote that to her.
Looks like you two were close once.
But she still erased my memories.
Something must have happened to change all that.
There has to be a clue as to why.
Perhaps there is...
If you can read hieroglyphs.
This isn't from our world.
What the hell was she doing with me?
This is it?
This is where she's hiding?
Indeed.
But she's not at home.
I don't sense her magic.
Good.
Okay.
You stay here as lookout.
I'm going in.
No, belle, y-you're not going in there alone.
Look, I won't be long.
I just need to find something.
What could you possibly want from the snow queen's cave?
A hat...
One that can strip a magical being of their powers.
That sounds like a remarkable object...
Almost too good to be true, which means it probably is.
It isn't, and I know she has it,
And I need to get it from her.
It's the only way to force her to tell us where anna is.
So this is about elsa's sister?
Why are you so invested in a girl you've never even met?
Because a hero always helps strangers.
Now keep watch.
I'll call out to you if I need your help.
Grand pabbie?
Grand pabbie, it's me!
Ooh, anna, my dear, you're back!
Have you come to tell us the new wedding date?
I have been working on my speech.
Not yet, but we can get into that later.
First, I want you to meet my friend belle.
She's come a long way to see you.
It's an honor to meet you.
I'm, uh...
I'm here because I-I...
I know.
I can help you get the memories of your mother.
[ whoosh ]
Take this to the place where you lost your memory,
Then brew a tea with the stone in the kettle.
When you drink it, your memories will return.
Thank you.
[ sighs ]
Thank you, anna.
I-I owe you, as well.
How can I repay you?
Having a new friend is payment enough.
All I need is a moment alone with pabbie.
I'll be quick.
What can I help you with, dear?
Some woman claims to be my aunt.
[ sighs ] I just don't believe her!
Mother would have told us if she had a sister.
Actually, she had two sisters.
Wait.
What?
Mother had two sisters that she never spoke about?
Why didn't she say anything?
Why didn't you say anything?
Because I was sworn to secrecy.
Grand pabbie, I need some answers.
Please.
[ sighs ]
Your mother, gerda, was the youngest of three.
And then there was helga, and ingrid was the oldest.
As children, the three girls were quite close,
Often seen playing together in the royal gardens.
But then, one day, helga and ingrid vanished.
No one ever knew what happened to them.
It was a tragedy the royal family wanted to forget.
And they did, with my help.
You took the memories of everyone in arendelle?
Yes.
And the royal family erased mention of helga and ingrid
From every book and record they could find in our realm.
Why wouldn't ingrid tell me what happened,
Or that she had another sister?
Those are questions you'd have to ask your aunt.
[ sighs ] like she would tell me.
If she's keeping these secrets,
Who knows what else she's hiding.
I have to warn elsa.
Belle, we have to go!
What?
Is everything okay?
I don't think so.
It's my aunt.
She's up to something.
The hat must be in here somewhere.
Woman:
[ echoing ] belle.
Belle.
Belle!
Over here, belle.
Over here, belle.
Over...
Here.
Hello, belle!
[ gasps ]
I was hoping you'd find me.
I wish I didn't have to wait to use this.
You'll be home before you know it.
We'll put you on the first ship back to the enchanted forest.
[ wind blows, thunder rumbles ]
If any ships are even setting sail.
It...
Looks like a storm's setting in.
I don't think it's a storm.
Well, what else could it be?
My aunt.
I don't think my aunt wants me to tell my sister
What I found out.
Well, if she...
Has all this magic and...
And you have, well, g-good intentions,
Then what are we gonna do?
I have more than good intentions!
She can't hurt us if she doesn't have magic.
[ wind gusts ] [ screams ] [ grunts ]
Belle!
Belle!
I can't pull myself up!
Just hold on!
I'll be right there!
Belle, hurry!
Please!
Oh!
[ gasps ]
Belle, hurry!
I'm coming!
I'm coming.
[ grunts ] [ screams ] anna!
Leave her alone!
You'll have to excuse us, but this is family business.
Mirror belle:
I'm surprised you were brave enough
To come in here.
I had to.
I have to find a way to help anna.
Why?
[ scoffs ]
You never really cared much for her before.
That's not true.
Sure, it is.
You chose that rock over her.
You had to remember what happened to your mother,
No matter what the cost.
I made a mistake.
I didn't mean to...
Ruin someone's life?
[ scoffs ]
It certainly wasn't your most heroic moment.
Not that you've ever really been hero material.
No, please...
Please stop.
Everyone sees you for what you really are, belle...
A pathetic coward.
I mean, why do you think the dark one married you?
You think it was love?
He needed someone weak, someone he could manipulate.
That's not true.
He loves me.
He gave me this.
[ laughs ]
You truly believe that's real?
Deep down,
You know what kind of beast you're dealing with.
Belle!
Belle.
The snow queen's approaching the cave.
Belle.
[ gasps ]
Look at me.
Don't look in the mirror.
Look at me.
We have to leave.
[ grunting ]
Please, let me go!
It's okay.
Let...
let me go!
It's okay.
We're back in the shop.
We're back in the shop.
It's okay.
No, no!
It's okay.
Wait.
No.
You were outside the cave.
I commanded that you wait there.
You commanded me to keep watch.
I sensed she was coming back.
I came to find you, and I'm glad I did.
[ knife clatters ] [ voice breaking ] I...
I hurt you.
I...
I'm so sorry, rumple.
It's okay.
When I f-found that mirror, something came over me,
Like a...
like a spell.
And... and it spoke to me and made me...
Made me believe all these horrible things,
And it said to me that the dagger you gave me is fake.
[ sniffles ]
I can assure you that nothing that mirror said is true.
It was imbued with the darkest of magic.
I-I know you would never wrong me.
I have wronged you.
I've kept a terrible secret from you.
I'm the reason...
That anna's missing.
I didn't want anyone to know
Until I could make things right and save anna.
But I couldn't.
I failed.
And all I managed to do was abuse the dagger
And... and take advantage of you, my true love.
I-I don't even know if I...
If I deserve to be with you anymore.
No, no, no.
You were only doing what you thought was right.
You... you forgive me?
Of course I forgive you.
[ crying ]
Thank you for telling me everything.
Thank you for understanding.
I never should have kept a secret from you,
Especially 'cause I know
That you'd never keep one from me.
I love you, rumple.
And I love you, too.
[ sighs ]
Father, I...
[ clears throat ]
I-I thought you'd be asleep.
I haven't slept in days.
How could I when you left without so much as a goodbye?
So, did you find what you were looking for?
No.
You were right, father.
I should have just left things alone.
That trip was a huge mistake.
I'm the one who's made the mistake, belle.
I've been keeping a secret from you.
I know what happened during the ogre attack.
Wait, what?
!
I didn't want to add to your grief.
When the ogres stormed the library
Where you and your mother had been working,
They rushed in.
They saw the ogres were about to attack.
She stood in the path of those monsters to protect you.
She kept them at bay
While the guards pulled you from danger.
But by the time they came to save your mother...
It was too late.
She sacrificed herself for me.
She loved you so much, and so do I.
I'm so glad you're back.
I don't know what I would have done
If the ogres had gotten you on the road.
They... they have reached the roads?
The war is not going well.
But you need not worry of such things.
We have soldiers to fight.
But those soldiers don't stand a chance.
They'll only slow down the ogres' advance.
We need someone who can stop them once and for all.
And who would that be?
On my journey, I did some reading.
And, well...
There's a wizard, a powerful, powerful wizard,
Who may just help us.
His name is...
I know his name!
And I dare not speak it.
Trust me, belle, if we do...
I know.
Magic always comes with a price.
But if mother's death taught me anything,
It's that sometimes a hero has to sacrifice everything
To save the people they love,
And I will do whatever I can to save our land.
And I can be a hero, just like mother.
And if that means summoning rumplestiltskin...
Then so be it.
I'm afraid we have a problem, dearie.
I caught a glimpse of your mirror today.
It's rather impressive, isn't it?
I had no idea your bride would be so easy to turn.
Watch yourself.
Now, I don't know exactly when you intend to use this mirror,
But you should know this.
I won't allow you to hurt those I care about.
And I won't allow you to derail my plans
Because you've suddenly gotten sentimental.
You only get one warning.
Which is more than you get.
I can't make any promises
Over who may or who may not survive.
You know, you were wrong before.
That you needed leverage to get what you want?
No, that I didn't have it.
I do.
Where did you get that?
Oh, that's irrelevant.
But now that I know what you're up to,
We can have a real talk.
You might want to reconsider your position,
Because I doubt you'd enjoy
Becoming just another embroidery on this hat.
Looks like you've just lost your leverage, dearie.
Anna.
It's time to wake up, dear.
What?
Where am I?
Exactly where you belong.
[ bars clatter ]
You can't just lock me in here!
Elsa won't stand for it!
Even when she finds out what you were planning to do to her?
Wait.
What?
You were planning to use this to strip away her magic.
No, that's not why I had it.
Really?
Then why didn't you tell elsa about it?
Because I-I didn't know how to tell her the truth.
I found it with a man that our parents sought out.
They went to him looking for a way
To strip elsa of the thing that makes her special.
And you're following in their footsteps.
I wasn't going to use it on her.
I wasn't going to use it on anybody...
Until you attacked me.
The rock trolls told me what you've been hiding,
That you and my mother had another sister.
The rock trolls shouldn't talk about things
That they don't understand.
But it's true.
What happened to her?
Some secrets are better left buried.
I don't understand.
What do you want?
!
What I have always wanted A family who will embrace me for who I am.
For a brief moment,
I thought the three of us could be that family...
You, me, and elsa.
But you showed me that plan would never work.
You have nothing in common with elsa and me.
You are the odd woman out.
And now I suppose I have to find someone else
To take your place.
The snow queen is your aunt?
According to this heraldry book I found in the library.
Her name is ingrid.
I didn't even know my mother had any sisters.
Well, spend a little more time in this town, love,
You'll realize just about everyone's related.
This book traces the lineage in arendelle
For generations.
That's gerda, my mother.
And this is helga, my other aunt.
Bloody hell.
Look at this one...
she looks just like you.
Maybe that's why she was so obsessed with you,
Why she kept all those relics from your childhood.
She came to this world looking for blondes?
There's a lot more than just me.
Don't I know it.
[ sighs ] she wasn't looking for a blonde.
She was looking for the savior.
What?
This scroll...
the writing is runic.
It's a prophecy.
It says, "the name of the savior is emma."
Before you even did.
She knew you were powerful.
But why?
It says it right here...
"and the savior shall become ingrid's sister."
What the hell does that mean?
Well, my mother died, and her other sister...
She's not around anymore.
I think ingrid believes in this prophecy.
[ door opens ] I think she's looking to replace them.
[ footsteps approach ] belle:
Elsa.
[ sighs ]
Yes.
I...
I'm sorry.
I am so, so sorry, but I-I've been keeping a secret.
I know your sister, anna.
She helped me once.
But when I had a chance to help her, I let her down.
And because I did,
She was captured by the snow queen.
What?
Where did this happen?
When?
Arendelle...
A long, long time ago.
And I have no idea where she is now.
But, uh, I'm afraid we have a more pressing concern.
The snow queen has a mirror imbued with terrible magic
That can do terrible things.
Mirror?
Easy enough, let's just go smash it.
It's not that simple.
Rumple told me it's part of an awful spell...
The spell of shattered sight.
If she casts it,
Its magic will make everyone in storybrooke
Turn on one another.
Bloody hell.
The entire town will destroy itself.
And there'd be no one left.
Except us.
What makes you think that she'd spare you and elsa?
[ sighing ] because of this.
She wants it to be just the three of us.
Her perfect family.

Hey, guys, I just got a brainstorm.
Why don't we pay the Taco Yum corporation to build a massive super-burrito, the biggest burrito ever made?
(MOUTH FULL) Sounds like a plan.
But if we're gonna build a burrito this large, we'll need...
where are we gonna build it?
The Grand Canyon.
Cool water keeps the lettuce cool on the bottom.
Hot sun keeps the meat and cheese hot on top.
It's a large enough area.
Could get 14 mile of beans, 14 mile of cheese, 14 mile of meat, 14 mile of lettuce and salsa,
All wrapped into a 25-mile round super-tortilla that would be the envy of old Mexico.
New Mexico too, now that I think about it.
The envy of all of Mexico.
- (GRUMBLES) How dare they?
- Yeah, it ain't right.
We're the ones that make tortillas, not them.
People could eat in two-month increments, fatten up.
It could take weeks to get through the beans to the meat and weeks more to get through the meat to the cheese.
Whoo-hoo!
I struck cheese!
Okay, gang, should the hot sauce be super fiery hot or super mild?
I might...

You know, normal grandma stuff, like her...
Her poker chips, and her flask, and, uh...
You know, her, uh... wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Yup, her switch blade.
This takes me back.
You never told me.
Was your Nona a shark or a jet?
Hey, look, I know you spent a lot of time decorating this room and the whole look of it is... it's a big deal to you.
Oh, it's not that big a deal.
It's just like a window into my soul.
I just want you to know that now that this chair is in here,
I really feel like it's my home too now.
I thought you felt at home when I added this adorable baby picture of you and your mom.
And that was very nice of you to do that, but like I told you before, that's my brother.
No.
No, no, no.
It's you.
But, honey, this chair here is very important to me 'cause, honestly, this chair is very symbolic of our whole relationship because if it wasn't for my grandmother and this chair, you and I would never have gotten together.
That's why it's so special to me.
Oh, well, if it's special to you, then it's special to me.
Oh, yeah, you can really smell the specialness.

Sadly, yes.

Oh, you know what?
Honestly, I believe that judging by all the hair he leaves in the shower.
Look, look, want to be technical about it, he's not helping me move.
He's helping Jordan move.
- She just bought a new bed.
- Oh, that's right.
You have those girl roommates with beds they need moved.
Shouldn't their boyfriends do that?
They don't have boyfriends.
Well, we should go.
We don't want to keep the girls waiting.
Oh, yeah, all right.
Let's go lift some stuff.
Why is Ryder so excited about lifting things?
I can't even get him to pick up his own socks.
They're helping move furniture for Zander's helpless and obviously manipulative female roommates.
Hmm, one might say you are displaying some possessiveness about a certain ex-boyfriend whose name begins with Zander.
Okay, for the record,
I have no feelings for him.
I don't care what he does with those harlots.
"Harlot"?
That's highbrow for skank.
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
Okay, he can go over there and move whatever he wants.
I got something that needs moving.
It's in the living room.
It's the color of hummingbird vomit.
And it's already killed once.
Okay, if the chair bothers you so much, what is it doing out there?
Well, Joe is very attached to it.
It's the very spot where Nona went to heaven.
(Groans) Why couldn't she have taken it with her?
I'll tell you why.
Because heaven is a beautiful place and they don't sit around in crap like that.
But you let Joe believe you were okay with it?
Well, I kind of half-smiled and he saw a whole smile.
Oh, so you faked it and he believed you.
It's not the first time I've faked it with Joe.
No!
No, no, no, no, no.

Okay, "hmm, smokey and ducky."
So, um, how are you gonna fake your way through that photo shoot on Sunday?
Oh, is that magazine guy coming here on Sunday?

Um, that's what it says.
It says, "'Toledo Living' is looking forward to taking a peek into Councilwoman Mel Burke's beautiful home to get to know her unique sense of style."
Boy, you know the timing of this is pretty funny.
In a sad, un-funny way.
Ugh!
The chair!
Hey, I'll give you 50 bucks if you set it on fire.
Okay, really?
That's the best you can come up with?
Okay, 75.
Why don't you just ask Joe if you can move it out of the living room for a couple of hours?
What?
You mean be honest?
Yes.
Okay, I'll try it, but only because I'm desperate.
Jordan, your bed is all set up.
Yeah, you should probably call the furniture company 'cause they obviously gave you way too many screws and brackets.
Thanks so much, you guys.
Do you mind if we pay you in last night's pizza?
Oh, sure.
Score.
Wow, Zander,
I don't think I've ever actually seen you sweat before.
It must be all that heavy lifting.
Well, fortunately, I have an extensive background in construction.
In middle school, I built my own Sydney opera house entirely out of popsicle sticks to scale.
That was cool.
So, Ryder, what's your story?
Hmm, not much to tell really.
I'm a senior this year.
And I have no idea what I'm doing after graduation.
Life after college is kind of a void for me too.
Good thing I have two more years to figure it out.
Ah, college... no, no.
I'm actually...
A senior in college.
Yes!
Yes, and not knowing what the future holds is really part of being a senior in college, like myself.
Yeah, it's pretty stressful for my older buddy, Ryder.
So what's your major again, old-timer?
Oh, you know.
Um, political...
Biology.
Sounds interesting.
So relieved you think so.
I'm a dancer.
That's great.
I think I've used up all the words in my head.
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.
There's one more thing in my bedroom that I need you to move.
Do you mind, Ryder?
Well, actually, I'm already feeling kind of sore from the...
Um, yeah, no.
I've heard nothing relieves muscle pain faster than heavy lifting.
I learned that in college in, um, advanced...
Psycho... zoology.
You should know I'm not looking for anything serious.
Okay.
I can fix that.
Or it can wait.
Hey, I just got your text.
What's up?
Yeah, I just wanted to ask you something.
It's, you know, not a big deal, just a small request.
I'm not gonna beat around the bush.
I'm just gonna come right out and say it.
When's that gonna be, exactly?
You know how that guy from "Toledo Living" magazine is gonna come over for the photo shoot?
Well, it's happening this Sunday.
Think you're gonna get to your point by then?
Well, I was thinking we could use those big, old sexy biceps of yours and maybe move Nona's chair out to the garage just temporarily.
What are you talking about?
Your big, old sexy biceps.
I don't understand.
What's wrong with the chair?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
The chair is perfect.
It's just... you know, does it really have to be here "all the time"?
Why did you just air-quote that?
We could just take it out for the photo shoot.
And who knows.
Maybe it'll be happy out there and want to stay.
Ah, okay.

- No, it's not.
It's a piece of me.
As a matter of fact, it's the only piece of me in this entire room!
No, that is so not true.
We have this lovely portrait of little baby Joe.
That's my brother!
Joe, the chair just doesn't fit here.
You know, you talk about us building a life together, but you only want it on your terms.
- Joe.
- No, forget it.
You know what?
Fine!
I'll get the chair out of here.
It'll be gone before Sunday.
And in its place will be a nice big empty space to remind us of the gap between you and me.
So we're good?
You know, Zander, I just...
I think you really missed with this one.
Cassandra's just been betrayed.
Her face should be a mask of shock and disgust.
Okay, like what?
Can you show me?
That's more like a mask of constipation.
Look, Lennox, I really just don't know what look you're going for.

Oh, hey, guys.
Hey, Joe, where did this awesome chair come from?
- It's great, right?
- Yes, it's so cozy.
It's like sitting in a hug.
Well, maybe you could tell someone else who lives in this house just how great you think that chair is.
- You know someone died in it?
- They must have died happy.
Well, don't go falling in love with it, Zander.
I'll be getting rid of this chair tomorrow morning.

Oh, Joe, wake up.
I just had the worst dream.
And you'll have much worse if you don't accept my chair.
(Screams)
- Hey.
- Hey, what are you still doing up?
Oh, I just had the worst nightmare.
Nona was a ghost and she was trying to force me to sit in her chair.
And then she got in bed with me.
Well, you know what Freud says about sex dreams.
Okay, it was not a sex dream.
But I think Nona might be right.
I don't know if I've totally accepted Joe into my life.
Well, if she's right, then you better go sit in the chair.
Lennox, if a beloved dead woman couldn't get me to sit in it, you really think you can?
Okay, let's just take your wine and walk ever-so-slowly into the living room.
Come on, come on.
Come on.
Follow the wine glass.
Follow the wine glass.
All right, now, I want you to close your eyes and imagine yourself in your furniture happy place.
Ooh, ooh, oh, "Crate and Barrel."
Yeah, they have those oak nesting tables.
Okay, imagine yourself running through a field of oak nesting tables.
Oh, are they on sale?
Sure.
You can open your eyes now.
Oh, look at that.
I did it.
Hey, you know what?
This chair isn't half bad.
It's actually pretty comfortable.
Oh, and it reclines.
Wow, you know, I think I can accept this chair.
Joe means that much to me.
All right, let's see what this baby can do.
Okay, Joe's gonna think I did this on purpose!
No because you don't hate the chair anymore.
Yeah, but he won't know that.
Well, maybe Joe won't know it was you.
Hello, it's red wine!
I might as well have written "Mel was here" on it!
I'm gonna go get some sponges and soap.
Yeah, and a hair dryer, quick!
What the hell's going on in here?
I can hear you guys all the way up in my...
What'd you do to my chair?
!
You ruined it!
- No... it was an accident.
- Oh, come on.
It was.
I swear.
I had accepted the chair.
I sat in it voluntarily.
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna take the cover off, put it in the bathtub, and I'll scrub it till my hands bleed.
Just let go of it, all right, you chair killer.
This thing needs to be professionally cleaned.
Wine stains are my specialty.
I once got wine off a dog.
- Mel, just let it go!
- No, no!
- Would you let...
let it go!
- I got it.
I said...
Both:
Look what you did!
What?
You tugged it last.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Hold up.
Hold up, Mel, look at this.
Oh my God, there's got to be like $10,000 in here.
And there's a note.
"Dear Joey, there's $10,000 in here..."
- There's...
- "All for you.
You were always my favorite grandson and I didn't want any of my leech relatives getting it.
Take this money and throw away the ugly chair.
Love, Nona."
Can you believe this?
She must have sewn the note and the money inside the chair.
Well, how were we supposed to find the note?
I don't know.
Clearly, she didn't have all the details worked out, hon.
Or maybe she did.
You know, Nona came to me in a dream last night.
And, um, told me that the only way I could accept you in my life was to accept her chair.
That's what I said.
Yeah, but it's got more oomph when it comes from a ghost.
I see, so now you're taking all your relationship advice
- from ghosts?
- Well, they see everything.
You know what?
She was right.
I think this chair can stay here.
Honey, I got to be honest with you.
I only liked the chair because I thought Nona liked the chair.
That ugly piece of crap has to go.
I've never loved you more.
What I have to say might be upsetting.
So I'm just gonna come out and I'm gonna say it.
Jordan's not into me.
It's about Jordan.
She's not...
Okay.
Good.
Go... you know what man?
I'm so sorry.
She's just like that.
And it's all my fault.
I should never have let you two get involved.
So it's okay if you need to cry.
I won't judge you.
No, no, I don't...
I don't really need to cry.
Look, man, I've been there.
Ryder, your... your feelings for a girl can last long after a relationship is over.
You say you're fine and then every time you see her, you work with her, you find yourself scrolling through all the photos on her timeline at 1:00 am.
That's... that's when you realize you're...
You're not over her.
You're not fine at all.
Yeah, uh, listen.
I've only known Jordan a couple of days, but, look, I promise.
I'm gonna be fine.
- Good?
- Hey... hey, you know what?
You just stay strong, brother.
Stay strong.
Oh, okay.
I will.
You know what?
Thank you, buddy, for helping me through this rough patch.
Any time, man, any time.
I couldn't have done it without you.
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.
Hmm, bye-bye, chair.
We'll miss you.
Really?
Where am I gonna keep my switch blade?
So what are you gonna do with the money?
Don't you mean "what are we gonna do with the money?"
I've been thinking about this, hon.
I think we should take the money and we should both get something for the house.
Something that we both like.
Aww, Joe, that's so sweet.
Oh, I know just what the living room could use.
What?
- A brand-new
Italian leather purse.
And I know just where to find it!
Italy!
I like that, but you know what I think would look good in there... how about this?
A motorcycle with two helmets.
Yeah, no.
All right, fine.
I have another idea.
- What about if...
- I don't think so.
You didn't even hear what I was gonna say.
I'm trying to be considerate.
I don't want to waste your time before I say "no" again.
I swear, it's like we're already married.
- (Static)
- Well, what just happened?
Oh, the cable went out.
The company's so
"you got to pay your bill on time."
Now what do we do?
Watch "avatar"?
It'll look great on my phone.
(Laughs)
Oh, I bet we can think of something better to do.
- Like what?
- Like this.
Okay, okay.
(Laughs)
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Nothing... that was great.
That was really great.
It's just I don't think that we should do this 'cause we're roommates.
Does this have anything to do with your ex?
No.
No, no.
Well, if you change your mind...
You know where I live.
I'm...
So messed up.
Melissa Joeyis recorded iin front of a live studio audience.
Just think, Lennox, now, thanks to Costco, we can cross toilet paper off of our checklist till the year 2035.
I don't know, aunt Mel, you did buy a lot of fiber bars.
Ow!
Okay, you better go help Ryder with that case of light bulbs.
Hey, oh, good.
You're home.
- Joe, how are your eyes?
- Perfect.
Damn!
I just bought 24 pairs of reading glasses.
Why would you do that?
Because they're cheaper by the case.
And because I imagine us growing old together.
I like the sound of that.
And you know what?
I can top it.
You know how you've been saying lately that now that we're a couple I should think of our house not just as your house, but as our house?
And that, you know, I should feel free to put my little personal touches everywhere?
Yeah, and I meant it, sweetie.
Well, the universe must have heard you because you are not gonna believe what my mom just sent me.
All right, babe, I want you to say hello to the newest addition to our living room.
Hi.
You recognize this chair, right?
This is my grandmother's chair.
Sure, yeah.
And as I recall, that's the one she died in.
It is.
It is.
This the very spot my Nona took leaving nothing here, but her..
Cold lifeless body.
Now the chair's ours!
You know, Joe.
I really don't deserve this.
♪ I guess you're stuck ♪
♪ with me. ♪
So I guess my mom finally started to divide up all my grandmother's things.
And it was her special bequest that this chair go to me.
Well, it certainly is a large bequest.
You know, my grandmother used to keep a bunch of stuff in this chair.
You know, normal grandma stuff, like her...
Her poker chips, and her flask, and, uh...
You know, her, uh... wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Yup, her switch blade.
This takes me back.
You never told me.
Was your Nona a shark or a jet?
Hey, look, I know you spent a lot of time decorating this room and the whole look of it is... it's a big deal to you.
Oh, it's not that big a deal.
It's just like a window into my soul.
I just want you to know that now that this chair is in here,
I really feel like it's my home too now.
I thought you felt at home when I added this adorable baby picture of you and your mom.
And that was very nice of you to do that, but like I told you before, that's my brother.
No.
No, no, no.
It's you.
But, honey, this chair here is very important to me 'cause, honestly, this chair is very symbolic of our whole relationship because if it wasn't for my grandmother and this chair, you and I would never have gotten together.
That's why it's so special to me.
Oh, well, if it's special to you, then it's special to me.
Oh, yeah, you can really smell the specialness.
- Ready, dude?
- Yeah, dude.
What's going on with you two?
You guys are suddenly best dudes?
I just need his help to move some stuff.
And Ryder's the strongest guy you know?
Sadly, yes.
All my friends are artists so amongst my peers, Ryder's a gorilla.
Oh, you know what?
Honestly, I believe that judging by all the hair he leaves in the shower.
Look, look, want to be technical about it, he's not helping me move.
He's helping Jordan move.
- She just bought a new bed.
- Oh, that's right.
You have those girl roommates with beds they need moved.
Shouldn't their boyfriends do that?
They don't have boyfriends.
Well, we should go.
We don't want to keep the girls waiting.
Oh, yeah, all right.
Let's go lift some stuff.
Why is Ryder so excited about lifting things?
I can't even get him to pick up his own socks.
They're helping move furniture for Zander's helpless and obviously manipulative female roommates.
Hmm, one might say you are displaying some possessiveness about a certain ex-boyfriend whose name begins with Zander.
Okay, for the record,
I have no feelings for him.
I don't care what he does with those harlots.
"Harlot"?
That's highbrow for skank.
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
Okay, he can go over there and move whatever he wants.
I got something that needs moving.
It's in the living room.
It's the color of hummingbird vomit.
And it's already killed once.
Okay, if the chair bothers you so much, what is it doing out there?
Well, Joe is very attached to it.
It's the very spot where Nona went to heaven.
Why couldn't she have taken it with her?
I'll tell you why.
Because heaven is a beautiful place and they don't sit around in crap like that.
But you let Joe believe you were okay with it?
Well, I kind of half-smiled and he saw a whole smile.
Oh, so you faked it and he believed you.
It's not the first time I've faked it with Joe.
No!
No, no, no, no, no.
When I tasted the smoked duck he made...
Okay, "hmm, smokey and ducky."
So, um, how are you gonna fake your way through that photo shoot on Sunday?
Oh, is that magazine guy coming here on Sunday?
!
Um, that's what it says.
It says, "'Toledo Living' is looking forward to taking a peek into Councilwoman Mel Burke's beautiful home to get to know her unique sense of style."
Boy, you know the timing of this is pretty funny.
In a sad, un-funny way.
Ugh!
The chair!
Hey, I'll give you 50 bucks if you set it on fire.
Okay, really?
That's the best you can come up with?
Okay, 75.
Why don't you just ask Joe if you can move it out of the living room for a couple of hours?
What?
You mean be honest?
Yes.
Okay, I'll try it, but only because I'm desperate.
Jordan, your bed is all set up.
Yeah, you should probably call the furniture company 'cause they obviously gave you way too many screws and brackets.
Thanks so much, you guys.
Do you mind if we pay you in last night's pizza?
Oh, sure.
Score.
Wow, Zander,
I don't think I've ever actually seen you sweat before.
It must be all that heavy lifting.
Well, fortunately, I have an extensive background in construction.
In middle school, I built my own Sydney opera house entirely out of popsicle sticks to scale.
That was cool.
So, Ryder, what's your story?
Hmm, not much to tell really.
I'm a senior this year.
And I have no idea what I'm doing after graduation.
Life after college is kind of a void for me too.
Good thing I have two more years to figure it out.
Ah, college... no, no.
I'm actually...
A senior in college.
Yes!
Yes, and not knowing what the future holds is really part of being a senior in college, like myself.
Yeah, it's pretty stressful for my older buddy, Ryder.
So what's your major again, old-timer?
Oh, you know.
Um, political...
Biology.
Sounds interesting.
So relieved you think so.
I'm a dancer.
That's great.
I think I've used up all the words in my head.
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.
There's one more thing in my bedroom that I need you to move.
Do you mind, Ryder?
Well, actually, I'm already feeling kind of sore from the...
Um, yeah, no.
I've heard nothing relieves muscle pain faster than heavy lifting.
I learned that in college in, um, advanced...
Psycho... zoology.
You should know I'm not looking for anything serious.
Okay.
I can fix that.
Or it can wait.
Hey, I just got your text.
What's up?
Yeah, I just wanted to ask you something.
It's, you know, not a big deal, just a small request.
I'm not gonna beat around the bush.
I'm just gonna come right out and say it.
When's that gonna be, exactly?
You know how that guy from "Toledo Living" magazine is gonna come over for the photo shoot?
Well, it's happening this Sunday.
Think you're gonna get to your point by then?
Well, I was thinking we could use those big, old sexy biceps of yours and maybe move Nona's chair out to the garage just temporarily.
What are you talking about?
Your big, old sexy biceps.
I don't understand.
What's wrong with the chair?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
The chair is perfect.
It's just... you know, does it really have to be here "all the time"?
Why did you just air-quote that?
We could just take it out for the photo shoot.
And who knows.
Maybe it'll be happy out there and want to stay.
Ah, okay.
I see what's going on here.
You know, you talked about how important
Nona's chair was to you, but really you were just swallowing your feelings like, um...
Oh, I don't know.
Smoky duck!
You knew?
!
Of course I knew!
I could see you choking on my duck.
You could barely put my duck in your mouth!
Look, I was just trying to make you happy.
Oh, you hate this chair!
You want it out of here.
- It's just a chair.
- No, it's not.
It's a piece of me.
As a matter of fact, it's the only piece of me in this entire room!
No, that is so not true.
We have this lovely portrait of little baby Joe.
That's my brother!
Joe, the chair just doesn't fit here.
You know, you talk about us building a life together, but you only want it on your terms.
- Joe.
- No, forget it.
You know what?
Fine!
I'll get the chair out of here.
It'll be gone before Sunday.
And in its place will be a nice big empty space to remind us of the gap between you and me.
So we're good?
You know, Zander, I just...
I think you really missed with this one.
Cassandra's just been betrayed.
Her face should be a mask of shock and disgust.
Okay, like what?
Can you show me?
That's more like a mask of constipation.
Look, Lennox, I really just don't know what look you're going for.
Oh, hey, guys.
Hey, Joe, where did this awesome chair come from?
- It's great, right?
- Yes, it's so cozy.
It's like sitting in a hug.
Well, maybe you could tell someone else who lives in this house just how great you think that chair is.
- You know someone died in it?
- They must have died happy.
Well, don't go falling in love with it, Zander.
I'll be getting rid of this chair tomorrow morning.
That's right, this unappreciated cherished memento of my childhood...
Well, the chair is going.
You must be happy.
You'd think?
Normally, I'm a big fan of getting what I want, but, you know,
Joe's guilt trip is ruining the whole thing.
Relationships, you guys are so lucky you broke up.
Oh my God, am I sitting on a knife?
!
Nona was pretty gangsta'.
♪ I'm making a late-night snack ♪
♪ 'cause I'm hungry, yes, I am. ♪
Is that Ryder singing?
Yes, he's been doing that non-stop since he helped your roommate move her bed.
It's just constant singing and dopey grins.
It's like he's the lead in a horrible, horrible musical.
You know, "The Book of Moron."
♪ I'm using the yellow mustard ♪
♪ 'cause there's no Dijon. ♪
Okay, do you have any idea what that's all about?
Yeah, he had sex with my roommate.
Oh, that's the look you were going for.
Shock and disgust.
Don't move a muscle.
Okay, and where were you when this hookup happened?
!
Well, I was in the kitchen doing dishes with Chris 'cause it was my night.
Actually, it was sort of Ryder's night.
Okay, the whole situation in that house of yours is completely sleazy:
Random hookups, hot tub parties, girls all over the place hitting on you... him!
Hitting on him!
How could you let my little brother get corrupted?
♪ Who's taking a bite of this sandwich?
♪
♪ it's me, Ryder!
♪
Hey, it seems like he's handling it pretty well.
Zander, my man!
Up top!
Hey, listen, I got a question for you.
I've been trying to get a hold of Jordan.
And she's not responding, so how many times an hour should I be texting her?
Ryder, have you thought of the possibility that maybe she's not into you as much as you're into her?
No, you weren't there.
Trust me, there is no way that she does not want another helping of Ryder lovin'.
Oh God, I really hope you didn't text her that.
You know, man, if I were you,
I would just maybe wait until she makes the next move.
I mean, okay, but, I mean it sure is weird that she hasn't texted me yet.
You know what?
I'm gonna go upstairs because there's better reception.
I'm actually gonna go sit by the router.
� Sitin' by the router �
� waitin' for my girl. �
Jordan's never texting him back, is she?
No, she's already moved on, twice.
This is all your fault.
You have to tell him that it's over, that your roommate has moved on to her next dance partner.
Yeah, but when I tell him, there's gonna be tears.
If you don't tell him, there's gonna be tears.
Stupid, stupid chair.
Don't touch that dial.
I'm watching my stories.
Nona, you're here.
I mean, hi, Nona, it's me, Tiffany!
I know it's you, Mel.
I'm dead.
I see everything.
Okay, well, I swear I was only in that handicap parking space for like three minutes, tops.
Oh, knock it off.
I've got a bone to pick with you.
Why can't you accept my chair?
You know, it doesn't really go with the rest of the room.
Plus, you kind of died in it.
People do worse things to furniture every day, especially in hotels.
Never... never touch the comforters.
Ugh!
I knew it.
You must accept the chair into your house the same way you accepted my Joey.
Have you accepted my Joey?
I've definitely accepted Joe.
I think I've accepted Joe.
Have I accepted Joe?
Ah ha, now we're getting somewhere.
The first step in accepting my Joey is to sit in this chair.
Well, I can't because you're sitting in it.
I'm a ghost.
Watch this.
- Watch what?
- Boo!
That never gets old.
Nona, how is sitting in your chair gonna help me accept Joe?
Sit in the chair.
Sit in the chair.
Why are you talking like that?
I'm trying to sound like a ghost, but it's not really me though.
Sit in the damn chair!
All right, all right, I'll try.
I can't!
I can't!
Don't make me!
Oh, Joe, wake up.
I just had the worst dream.
And you'll have much worse if you don't accept my chair.
- Hey.
- Hey, what are you still doing up?
Oh, I just had the worst nightmare.
Nona was a ghost and she was trying to force me to sit in her chair.
And then she got in bed with me.
Well, you know what Freud says about sex dreams.
Okay, it was not a sex dream.
But I think Nona might be right.
I don't know if I've totally accepted Joe into my life.
Well, if she's right, then you better go sit in the chair.
Lennox, if a beloved dead woman couldn't get me to sit in it, you really think you can?

- No, no!
- Would you let...
let it go!
- I got it.
I said...
Look what you did!
What?
You tugged it last.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Hold up.
Hold up, Mel, look at this.
Oh my God, there's got to be like $10,000 in here.
And there's a note.
"Dear Joey, there's $10,000 in here..."
- There's...
- "All for you.

She's just like that.

I should never have let you two get involved.

No, no, I don't...

It'll look great on my phone.
Oh, I bet we can think of something better to do.
- Like what?
- Like this.
Okay, okay.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Nothing... that was great.
That was really great.
It's just I don't think that we should do this 'cause we're roommates.
Does this have anything to do with your ex?
No.
No, no.
Well, if you change your mind...
You know where I live.
I'm...
So messed up.
Melissa Joeyis recorded iin front of a live studio audience.
Just think, Lennox, now, thanks to Costco, we can cross toilet paper off of our checklist till the year 2035.
I don't know, aunt Mel, you did buy a lot of fiber bars.
Ow!
Okay, you better go help Ryder with that case of light bulbs.
Hey, oh, good.
You're home.
- Joe, how are your eyes?
- Perfect.
Damn!
I just bought 24 pairs of reading glasses.
Why would you do that?
Because they're cheaper by the case.
And because I imagine us growing old together.
I like the sound of that.
And you know what?
I can top it.
You know how you've been saying lately that now that we're a couple I should think of our house not just as your house, but as our house?
And that, you know, I should feel free to put my little personal touches everywhere?
Yeah, and I meant it, sweetie.
Well, the universe must have heard you because you are not gonna believe what my mom just sent me.
All right, babe, I want you to say hello to the newest addition to our living room.
Hi.
You recognize this chair, right?
This is my grandmother's chair.
Sure, yeah.
And as I recall, that's the one she died in.
It is.
It is.
This the very spot my Nona took leaving nothing here, but her..
Cold lifeless body.
Now the chair's ours!
You know, Joe.
I really don't deserve this.
♪ I guess you're stuck ♪
♪ with me. ♪
So I guess my mom finally started to divide up all my grandmother's things.
And it was her special bequest that this chair go to me.
Well, it certainly is a large bequest.
You know, my grandmother used to keep a bunch of stuff in this chair.
You know, normal grandma stuff, like her...
Her poker chips, and her flask, and, uh...
You know, her, uh... wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Yup, her switch blade.
This takes me back.
You never told me.
Was your Nona a shark or a jet?
Hey, look, I know you spent a lot of time decorating this room and the whole look of it is... it's a big deal to you.
Oh, it's not that big a deal.
It's just like a window into my soul.
I just want you to know that now that this chair is in here,
I really feel like it's my home too now.
I thought you felt at home when I added this adorable baby picture of you and your mom.
And that was very nice of you to do that, but like I told you before, that's my brother.
No.
No, no, no.
It's you.
But, honey, this chair here is very important to me 'cause, honestly, this chair is very symbolic of our whole relationship because if it wasn't for my grandmother and this chair, you and I would never have gotten together.
That's why it's so special to me.
Oh, well, if it's special to you, then it's special to me.
Oh, yeah, you can really smell the specialness.
- Ready, dude?
- Yeah, dude.
What's going on with you two?
You guys are suddenly best dudes?
I just need his help to move some stuff.
And Ryder's the strongest guy you know?
Sadly, yes.
All my friends are artists so amongst my peers, Ryder's a gorilla.
Oh, you know what?
Honestly, I believe that judging by all the hair he leaves in the shower.
Look, look, want to be technical about it, he's not helping me move.
He's helping Jordan move.
- She just bought a new bed.
- Oh, that's right.
You have those girl roommates with beds they need moved.
Shouldn't their boyfriends do that?
They don't have boyfriends.
Well, we should go.
We don't want to keep the girls waiting.
Oh, yeah, all right.
Let's go lift some stuff.
Why is Ryder so excited about lifting things?
I can't even get him to pick up his own socks.
They're helping move furniture for Zander's helpless and obviously manipulative female roommates.
Hmm, one might say you are displaying some possessiveness about a certain ex-boyfriend whose name begins with Zander.
Okay, for the record,
I have no feelings for him.
I don't care what he does with those harlots.
"Harlot"?
That's highbrow for skank.
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
Okay, he can go over there and move whatever he wants.
I got something that needs moving.
It's in the living room.
It's the color of hummingbird vomit.
And it's already killed once.
Okay, if the chair bothers you so much, what is it doing out there?
Well, Joe is very attached to it.
It's the very spot where Nona went to heaven.
Why couldn't she have taken it with her?
I'll tell you why.
Because heaven is a beautiful place and they don't sit around in crap like that.
But you let Joe believe you were okay with it?
Well, I kind of half-smiled and he saw a whole smile.
Oh, so you faked it and he believed you.
It's not the first time I've faked it with Joe.
No!
No, no, no, no, no.
When I tasted the smoked duck he made...
Okay, "hmm, smokey and ducky."
So, um, how are you gonna fake your way through that photo shoot on Sunday?
Oh, is that magazine guy coming here on Sunday?
!
Um, that's what it says.
It says, "'Toledo Living' is looking forward to taking a peek into Councilwoman Mel Burke's beautiful home to get to know her unique sense of style."
Boy, you know the timing of this is pretty funny.
In a sad, un-funny way.
Ugh!
The chair!
Hey, I'll give you 50 bucks if you set it on fire.
Okay, really?
That's the best you can come up with?
Okay, 75.
Why don't you just ask Joe if you can move it out of the living room for a couple of hours?
What?
You mean be honest?
Yes.
Okay, I'll try it, but only because I'm desperate.
Jordan, your bed is all set up.
Yeah, you should probably call the furniture company 'cause they obviously gave you way too many screws and brackets.
Thanks so much, you guys.
Do you mind if we pay you in last night's pizza?
Oh, sure.
Score.
Wow, Zander,
I don't think I've ever actually seen you sweat before.
It must be all that heavy lifting.
Well, fortunately, I have an extensive background in construction.
In middle school, I built my own Sydney opera house entirely out of popsicle sticks to scale.
That was cool.
So, Ryder, what's your story?
Hmm, not much to tell really.
I'm a senior this year.
And I have no idea what I'm doing after graduation.
Life after college is kind of a void for me too.
Good thing I have two more years to figure it out.
Ah, college... no, no.
I'm actually...
A senior in college.
Yes!
Yes, and not knowing what the future holds is really part of being a senior in college, like myself.
Yeah, it's pretty stressful for my older buddy, Ryder.
So what's your major again, old-timer?
Oh, you know.
Um, political...
Biology.
Sounds interesting.
So relieved you think so.
I'm a dancer.
That's great.
I think I've used up all the words in my head.
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.
There's one more thing in my bedroom that I need you to move.
Do you mind, Ryder?
Well, actually, I'm already feeling kind of sore from the...
Um, yeah, no.
I've heard nothing relieves muscle pain faster than heavy lifting.
I learned that in college in, um, advanced...
Psycho... zoology.
You should know I'm not looking for anything serious.
Okay.
I can fix that.
Or it can wait.
Hey, I just got your text.
What's up?
Yeah, I just wanted to ask you something.
It's, you know, not a big deal, just a small request.
I'm not gonna beat around the bush.
I'm just gonna come right out and say it.
When's that gonna be, exactly?
You know how that guy from "Toledo Living" magazine is gonna come over for the photo shoot?
Well, it's happening this Sunday.
Think you're gonna get to your point by then?
Well, I was thinking we could use those big, old sexy biceps of yours and maybe move Nona's chair out to the garage just temporarily.
What are you talking about?
Your big, old sexy biceps.
I don't understand.
What's wrong with the chair?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
The chair is perfect.
It's just... you know, does it really have to be here "all the time"?
Why did you just air-quote that?
We could just take it out for the photo shoot.
And who knows.
Maybe it'll be happy out there and want to stay.
Ah, okay.
I see what's going on here.
You know, you talked about how important
Nona's chair was to you, but really you were just swallowing your feelings like, um...
Oh, I don't know.
Smoky duck!
You knew?
!
Of course I knew!
I could see you choking on my duck.
You could barely put my duck in your mouth!
Look, I was just trying to make you happy.
Oh, you hate this chair!
You want it out of here.
- It's just a chair.
- No, it's not.
It's a piece of me.
As a matter of fact, it's the only piece of me in this entire room!
No, that is so not true.
We have this lovely portrait of little baby Joe.
That's my brother!
Joe, the chair just doesn't fit here.
You know, you talk about us building a life together, but you only want it on your terms.
- Joe.
- No, forget it.
You know what?
Fine!
I'll get the chair out of here.
It'll be gone before Sunday.
And in its place will be a nice big empty space to remind us of the gap between you and me.
So we're good?
You know, Zander, I just...
I think you really missed with this one.
Cassandra's just been betrayed.
Her face should be a mask of shock and disgust.
Okay, like what?
Can you show me?
That's more like a mask of constipation.
Look, Lennox, I really just don't know what look you're going for.
Oh, hey, guys.
Hey, Joe, where did this awesome chair come from?
- It's great, right?
- Yes, it's so cozy.
It's like sitting in a hug.
Well, maybe you could tell someone else who lives in this house just how great you think that chair is.
- You know someone died in it?
- They must have died happy.
Well, don't go falling in love with it, Zander.
I'll be getting rid of this chair tomorrow morning.
That's right, this unappreciated cherished memento of my childhood...
Well, the chair is going.
You must be happy.
You'd think?
Normally, I'm a big fan of getting what I want, but, you know,
Joe's guilt trip is ruining the whole thing.
Relationships, you guys are so lucky you broke up.
Oh my God, am I sitting on a knife?
!
Nona was pretty gangsta'.
♪ I'm making a late-night snack ♪
♪ 'cause I'm hungry, yes, I am. ♪
Is that Ryder singing?
Yes, he's been doing that non-stop since he helped your roommate move her bed.
It's just constant singing and dopey grins.
It's like he's the lead in a horrible, horrible musical.
You know, "The Book of Moron."
♪ I'm using the yellow mustard ♪
♪ 'cause there's no Dijon. ♪
Okay, do you have any idea what that's all about?
Yeah, he had sex with my roommate.
Oh, that's the look you were going for.
Shock and disgust.
Don't move a muscle.
Okay, and where were you when this hookup happened?
!
Well, I was in the kitchen doing dishes with Chris 'cause it was my night.
Actually, it was sort of Ryder's night.
Okay, the whole situation in that house of yours is completely sleazy:
Random hookups, hot tub parties, girls all over the place hitting on you... him!
Hitting on him!
How could you let my little brother get corrupted?
♪ Who's taking a bite of this sandwich?
♪
♪ it's me, Ryder!
♪
Hey, it seems like he's handling it pretty well.
Zander, my man!
Up top!
Hey, listen, I got a question for you.
I've been trying to get a hold of Jordan.
And she's not responding, so how many times an hour should I be texting her?
Ryder, have you thought of the possibility that maybe she's not into you as much as you're into her?
No, you weren't there.
Trust me, there is no way that she does not want another helping of Ryder lovin'.
Oh God, I really hope you didn't text her that.
You know, man, if I were you,
I would just maybe wait until she makes the next move.
I mean, okay, but, I mean it sure is weird that she hasn't texted me yet.
You know what?
I'm gonna go upstairs because there's better reception.
I'm actually gonna go sit by the router.
� Sitin' by the router �
� waitin' for my girl. �
Jordan's never texting him back, is she?
No, she's already moved on, twice.
This is all your fault.
You have to tell him that it's over, that your roommate has moved on to her next dance partner.
Yeah, but when I tell him, there's gonna be tears.
If you don't tell him, there's gonna be tears.
Stupid, stupid chair.
Don't touch that dial.
I'm watching my stories.
Nona, you're here.
I mean, hi, Nona, it's me, Tiffany!
I know it's you, Mel.
I'm dead.
I see everything.
Okay, well, I swear I was only in that handicap parking space for like three minutes, tops.
Oh, knock it off.
I've got a bone to pick with you.
Why can't you accept my chair?
You know, it doesn't really go with the rest of the room.
Plus, you kind of died in it.
People do worse things to furniture every day, especially in hotels.
Never... never touch the comforters.
Ugh!
I knew it.
You must accept the chair into your house the same way you accepted my Joey.
Have you accepted my Joey?
I've definitely accepted Joe.
I think I've accepted Joe.
Have I accepted Joe?
Ah ha, now we're getting somewhere.
The first step in accepting my Joey is to sit in this chair.
Well, I can't because you're sitting in it.
I'm a ghost.
Watch this.
- Watch what?
- Boo!
That never gets old.
Nona, how is sitting in your chair gonna help me accept Joe?
Sit in the chair.
Sit in the chair.
Why are you talking like that?
I'm trying to sound like a ghost, but it's not really me though.
Sit in the damn chair!
All right, all right, I'll try.
I can't!
I can't!
Don't make me!
Oh, Joe, wake up.
I just had the worst dream.
And you'll have much worse if you don't accept my chair.
- Hey.
- Hey, what are you still doing up?
Oh, I just had the worst nightmare.
Nona was a ghost and she was trying to force me to sit in her chair.
And then she got in bed with me.
Well, you know what Freud says about sex dreams.
Okay, it was not a sex dream.
But I think Nona might be right.
I don't know if I've totally accepted Joe into my life.
Well, if she's right, then you better go sit in the chair.
Lennox, if a beloved dead woman couldn't get me to sit in it, you really think you can?
Okay, let's just take your wine and walk ever-so-slowly into the living room.
Come on, come on.
Come on.
Follow the wine glass.
Follow the wine glass.
All right, now, I want you to close your eyes and imagine yourself in your furniture happy place.
Ooh, ooh, oh, "Crate and Barrel."
Yeah, they have those oak nesting tables.
Okay, imagine yourself running through a field of oak nesting tables.
Oh, are they on sale?
Sure.
You can open your eyes now.
Oh, look at that.
I did it.
Hey, you know what?
This chair isn't half bad.
It's actually pretty comfortable.
Oh, and it reclines.
Wow, you know, I think I can accept this chair.
Joe means that much to me.
All right, let's see what this baby can do.
Okay, Joe's gonna think I did this on purpose!
No because you don't hate the chair anymore.
Yeah, but he won't know that.
Well, maybe Joe won't know it was you.
Hello, it's red wine!
I might as well have written "Mel was here" on it!
I'm gonna go get some sponges and soap.
Yeah, and a hair dryer, quick!
What the hell's going on in here?
I can hear you guys all the way up in my...
What'd you do to my chair?
!
You ruined it!
- No... it was an accident.
- Oh, come on.
It was.
I swear.
I had accepted the chair.
I sat in it voluntarily.
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna take the cover off, put it in the bathtub, and I'll scrub it till my hands bleed.
Just let go of it, all right, you chair killer.
This thing needs to be professionally cleaned.
Wine stains are my specialty.
I once got wine off a dog.
- Mel, just let it go!
- No, no!
- Would you let...
let it go!
- I got it.
I said...
Look what you did!
What?
You tugged it last.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Hold up.
Hold up, Mel, look at this.
Oh my God, there's got to be like $10,000 in here.
And there's a note.
"Dear Joey, there's $10,000 in here..."
- There's...
- "All for you.
You were always my favorite grandson and I didn't want any of my leech relatives getting it.
Take this money and throw away the ugly chair.
Love, Nona."
Can you believe this?
She must have sewn the note and the money inside the chair.
Well, how were we supposed to find the note?
I don't know.
Clearly, she didn't have all the details worked out, hon.
Or maybe she did.
You know, Nona came to me in a dream last night.
And, um, told me that the only way I could accept you in my life was to accept her chair.
That's what I said.
Yeah, but it's got more oomph when it comes from a ghost.
I see, so now you're taking all your relationship advice
- from ghosts?
- Well, they see everything.
You know what?
She was right.
I think this chair can stay here.
Honey, I got to be honest with you.
I only liked the chair because I thought Nona liked the chair.
That ugly piece of crap has to go.
I've never loved you more.
What I have to say might be upsetting.
So I'm just gonna come out and I'm gonna say it.
Jordan's not into me.
It's about Jordan.
She's not...
Okay.
Good.
Go... you know what man?
I'm so sorry.
She's just like that.
And it's all my fault.
I should never have let you two get involved.
So it's okay if you need to cry.
I won't judge you.
No, no, I don't...
I don't really need to cry.
Look, man, I've been there.
Ryder, your... your feelings for a girl can last long after a relationship is over.
You say you're fine and then every time you see her, you work with her, you find yourself scrolling through all the photos on her timeline at 1:00 am.
That's... that's when you realize you're...
You're not over her.
You're not fine at all.
Yeah, uh, listen.
I've only known Jordan a couple of days, but, look, I promise.
I'm gonna be fine.
- Good?
- Hey... hey, you know what?
You just stay strong, brother.
Stay strong.
Oh, okay.
I will.
You know what?
Thank you, buddy, for helping me through this rough patch.
Any time, man, any time.
I couldn't have done it without you.
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.
Hmm, bye-bye, chair.
We'll miss you.
Really?
Where am I gonna keep my switch blade?
So what are you gonna do with the money?
Don't you mean "what are we gonna do with the money?"
I've been thinking about this, hon.
I think we should take the money and we should both get something for the house.
Something that we both like.
Aww, Joe, that's so sweet.
Oh, I know just what the living room could use.
What?
- A brand-new
Italian leather purse.
And I know just where to find it!
Italy!
I like that, but you know what I think would look good in there... how about this?
A motorcycle with two helmets.
Yeah, no.
All right, fine.
I have another idea.
- What about if...
- I don't think so.
You didn't even hear what I was gonna say.
I'm trying to be considerate.
I don't want to waste your time before I say "no" again.
I swear, it's like we're already married.
Well, what just happened?
Oh, the cable went out.
The company's so
"you got to pay your bill on time."
Now what do we do?
Watch "avatar"?
It'll look great on my phone.
Oh, I bet we can think of something better to do.
- Like what?
- Like this.
Okay, okay.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Nothing... that was great.
That was really great.
It's just I don't think that we should do this 'cause we're roommates.
Does this have anything to do with your ex?
No.
No, no.
Well, if you change your mind...
You know where I live.
I'm...
So messed up.
Objection Your Honour.
You're looking far too hot.
And I reject... cause I need a refill.
Both objections sustained so crap that bottle of tequilla and get out of these stuffy suits.
- They are stuffy, aren't they?
- They are stuffy.
And meet us in the hot tub.
Oh my god.
- Okay.
- This is a court order.
I don't see we have any choice.
We see you in two minutes?
Peter, Jared.
Coleen.
What are you doing here?
Katie:
Did you guys double book dates?
Oh, it's my fault.
- I just showed up uninvited.
- Yeah.
This is my friend Cindy, and she's in a lot of trouble.
She needs a lawyer.
Oh, that's great, 'cause, uh, we are... we are lawyers.
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't usually bust up people's dates.
One of us should go.
Peter:
Yeah.
Uh... [Sighs]
Sorry.
It's gonna be you.
She's his mom.

How did you and my mom meet?
Uh, through my work.
You're a sex surrogate, too?
A dancer over at Kandy's Strip Club.
- Oh.
On sunset.
- Surprisingly good salad bar there.
A lot of us go to Colleen just to talk, and she's helped me through a couple of tough situations.
And she returned the favor by teaching me how to pole dance.
- It's a great workout.
- I imagine it is.
Imagine less. [Sighs]
- Tell them about the pole.
- Okay.
So, I-I was working.
I have this move.
It's called the double helix.
So, I jumped on the pole, and it broke off in my hands.
I mean, it was rusted clear through.
- Ooh.
- So, I flew off the stage and landed headfirst into some guy's lap.
I mean, could you imagine?
- Uh-huh.
- Keep going.
I sprained my knee, couldn't work for a week, and now the new manager, Cliff, won't pay any of my medical bills.
And now he's suing her to pay for a new pole.
$1,300.
That's ridiculous.
I...
Know it probably sounds dumb, but, um, the girls at Kandy's... they really look up to me, and I look out for them the way you look out for me.
Mm.
It doesn't sound dumb.
So you'll take the case?
Uh, we'll discuss it.
We'll take it. [Gasps]
That's wonderful.
- I said we'll discuss it.
- Yeah, we discussed it.
You said "we'll discuss it," I said "we'll take it."
- As long as we discussed it.
- Yeah.
Now that that's settled, seems like a shame to waste a perfectly good hot tub.
Colleen?
Oh, that's... that's sweet, Jared, but I don't have my suit.
Don't.
Mom, I love you, but you got to go home.
- Bye, Colleen.
- And next time, you got to call.
We'll call you tomorrow.
- Thanks.
- Nice to meet you.
What just happened?
There were four women here in the last half hour, and now it's just you and me.
- Want to hot tub?
- No.
And would you stop asking my mom to hot tub?
No.
Hey.
Hey.
Look at this.
Oh!
Admiring the sign, huh?

Franklin Bash.
I still get tingles in my spine.
Well, word on the street is you're barely keeping this place afloat.
Is that the word on the street, Serpico?
[Laughs]
What are you doing here?
You're representing the woman who got fired from Kandy's Strip Club?
Um...
Why?
Well, you can just serve it on me.
You're representing the strip club?
Oh, this is part of your "let me show Jared and Peter what a good lawyer I am" plan.
Oh, but if you go by the scoreboard...
- Which we do.
- We own you.
Not to mention the conflict of interest.
Right, of you going against a stripper when you so famously slept with that summer associate who was also a stripper.
It's not famous.
You know that Karp slept with a stripper?
Yeah, summer intern.
Famous!
We met before.
Juanita, right?
Just Anita.
There's no "wah."
- Peter:
Dude.
That's kind of racist.
- Really racist.
Don't listen to them.
I never do.
Anita.
I will not make that mistake again.
Good.
Make sure that you don't, Damien.
Ew.
Jared:
Anita, infeld wants us in court in 10 minutes.
Oh, don't dawdle.
Run along.
Don't want to keep your master waiting.
Ian: [Scottish accent] Case dismissed!
Thanks for saving my ass again.
That's what we're here for, Ian.
I've never actually met a polo player before, not to mention one that got into a brawl during a game.
That son of a bitch was hooking me all day.
Well, that, and you finished off a fifth of Macallan's before the match.
Listen, there may be a bit of a problem with paying my legal fee.
[Chuckles] What do you mean?
You're Scottish royalty.
You're... you're a duke.
Royalty's overrated, trust me.
You see?
Only a royal can say something like that.
Seriously.
I'm broke.
After this last incident, the family cut me loose.
All I've got left is my worthless title.
Well, actually, it's not worthless.
At my last firm, we represented the Danish royal family.
When there was family in-fighting, they were able to sell titles to satisfy debts.
Danes, total savages.
They got good money for them, too.
- Really?
- You really tired of being a duke?
Completely.
You want to be a duke?
This is insane, even for you.
Only if you think about it.
You're a duke?
[Scottish accent] Duke of Landingshire, to be exact.
How much were Ian's fees?
- [Normal voice] 7 grand.
- Well, I did half the case.
I should be duke half the time.
That's the kind of reaction I'd expect from a commoner.
- [Chuckling] No.
No, no, no, no, no.
- Royalty.
Come on.
- Open the door.
- It's common courtesy.
- Open the door.
- Get the door.
D-don't!
I'm a duke, you dick!

Be reasonable.
Give Cindy her job back, buy a new pole, pay her medical bills, and we'll all be done here.
[Scoffs] That's it?
I'm sensing sarcasm.
You made me lose count.
Now, look, if I start paying out every time someone falls around here, this place will turn into a skating rink.
Girls slipping, saying they're hurt.
Unh-unh.
Bad business.
What's bad business is treating your employees like property.
Property.
All right, here's some business advice.
Get the hell out of my club before you get your faces pounded in.
And I hope you're hiring strippers at your firm because your girl Cindy... she's fired.
Fine.
We'll be suing your ass for wrongful termination.
Then we'll see who's fired.
Okay, that last part came out more aggressive than I wanted.
So, I will bid you adieu.
- Just get out of here.
- Okay.
That was all him.
Lawyers.
[Rock music plays]
♪ Try to keep my cool, but the devil says... ♪
Stanton:
Oh, yes.
Mmm.
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
- Oh, sorry, sir.
- Sorry, we should've knocked.
Nonsense.
Come in, come in, come in.
Yoomi, this is Peter and Jared.
Yoomi's my pedicurist.
Yoomi inherited my poor, tired feet from her mother, who learned from the royal empress herself.
Ah.
Yoomi, would you please excuse us?
Hm.
Jared:
Sorry, I-I thought you were, uh...
- No, no.
Please.
- Okay.
- You wanted to see us, sir?
- Yes.
I understand you've become a duke and that you procured the title in lieu of legal fees.
Thank you.
And I told him, I said legal fees are more important than...
Well done, Jared.
[Chuckles]
You know, it... it brings to mind my brush with royalty.
Summer nights with Lizzie, H.R.H.
Her royal highness.
Oh, of course I was just a 19-year-old boy, and I had to be smuggled into Buckingham Palace as a footman.
My God, she was a passionate woman.
But, of course, always formal.
Mm-hmm.
Which brings me to my point.
- There's a point?
- A man doesn't become royalty every day.
No.
See, this is a very, very special time.
Which is why I'd like to throw your royal coming-out party.
Ah.
You're finally coming out.
We'll do it at the beach house, huh?
Capital idea.
Thursday next?
- Seriously gonna kill you.
- Yes.
Uh, well, would you send Yoomi back in?
You got it.
Oh, by the way, boys,
I still haven't received the SR-17 business tax forms.
No.
W-well, we thought now that you're back with the firm...
Yeah, we thought you'd do them.
Yeah, like you did before Karp took them over.
Oh, I heard that Damien may have been here.
- Is that correct?
- He didn't stop in to see you?
[Sighs]
Send Yoomi back in, would you?
Oh.
Yes, sir.
Jared:
Hate doing SR-17s.
Remember how Karp used to do them?
Oh!
With the little line through the 7s.
- They were so perfect and elegant.
- I miss his 7s.
I don't like seeing Stanton like this.
He misses Karp.
Hey.
- Hi, how are you?
Hey.
- Morning.
So, I texted with Damien last night.
He thinks that the club owners are gonna back down.
Well, that is good news, but you texted Karp?
What's going on with the eyeliner?
Since when do you get all gussied up for court?
[Laughs] I always look like this.
- Oh, hey, hey.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hey.
- You know what?
I got that video of the bulldog puppy rolling down the hill.
You're right, it's hilarious.
[Laughs] Thank you.
Um, I'll, uh, I'll see you inside.
- Okay.
- Karpe diem.
- Karp-instein.
- Just the man we're looking for.
That's good.
I'm looking for you, and I... and I do.
I love it when you add syllables to the end of my name.
It's very funny.
What's the good word?
Your client ready to settle?
I talked to him, but he's dug in.
There is a silver lining.
Well, we love silver linings.
Almost as much as cute animal videos.
Oh, my God, L.O.L. They're hilarious. [Chuckles mockingly]
But I think you're really gonna love this one, then.
The other club owners have banded together to make sure the case doesn't go forward, so they're gonna pay me double my rate and I get to kick both your asses, so win-win for me.
All right.
Oddly, I still miss him.
Are you looking up the cute puppy video?
Trying to.
Sounds good.
What is that?
Oh, God, is that your screen saver?
Sorry.
You weren't supposed to see that.
What is that?
It's nothing.
Judge Reid:
Mr. Franklin, Mr. Bash, you're representing a dancer from Kandy's Strip Club.
That's correct, your honor.
All right, full disclosure.
I have been to that establishment for the salad.
Jared:
Baby corn, your honor, right?
[Laughs] It's amazing.
He picks them up and pretends that they're real ears of corn, and then he... [munching]
Karp:
It's hilarious, yeah.
If you hadn't stolen it from the movie "Big."
True story...
Hanks got that from me.
- True story.
- Your honor, we move for immediate dismissal of the wrongful termination claim.
Okay.
Our esteemed opposing counsel is premature, your honor.
Kind of an issue with him.
We haven't even presented any facts yet, tiger.
The facts are irrelevant.
[Scoffs] Are they?
You can't bring a wrongful termination suit unless you're an employee.
Right.
We can call 20 witnesses to prove Miss Maloney worked... as an independent contractor, who under section 3312 of the civil code cannot sue as an employee.
Independent contractor?
She's worked more than 40 hours a week.
There's no employment agreement, at least not with Kandy's Strip Club.
Your honor, if I may.
The dancers are allowed to pursue outside employment, which Miss Maloney does as a private workout instructor.
We ask that this be marked as defense exhibit "b."
Uh, your honor, could we...
Miss Maloney, I feel for you, but the law is the law.
The defense motion is granted.
[Gavel bangs] Case dismissed.
How can they get away with that?
Because they ruled you weren't a real employee.
[Scoffs]
All right, this isn't real broken glass onstage?
Or what about this?
Torn medial vastus.
I mean, every dancer I know has injuries like these.
You just should've told us about the outside work earlier.
I didn't think it mattered.
I mean, they want us to do stuff like that.
Yes, of course.
To inoculate themselves in cases like this.
Karp:
Miss Maloney.
Oh, Karp, look, if you're here to do a victory lap,
- you're not gonna finish it.
- Not at all, I just wanted you to know that I've convinced the club owners to return your personal belongings.
They'll be waiting for you at the club.
You're an angel.
Gentlemen.
We're sorry about this.
You've been great.
[Chuckles] Really.
Um, I do have one last favor, though.
Name it.
Could you go to the club and pick my stuff up?
I just...
I can't.
Um... and tell the girls I said goodbye?
Cindy, maybe we can ask...
No.
No, you've... you were great.
Really, you've done enough.
Thank you.
[Sighs]
You feel like we've done enough?
I feel like we're just getting started.
Hey, tell Cindy we're sorry, huh?
Yeah, I will.
I'll be back in an hour.
Did you, uh, did you talk to Anita?
She's on her way now.
[Scottish accent] Jared Franklin?
Guilty as charged.
Albert Daugherty.
You're the new Duke of Landingshire?
[Chuckles]
Yes, I am.
I'm the Duke of Weddington.
Our lands border the morrow river 10 miles south Inverness.
Oh.
You're a long way from home.
No, no.
Not really.
I live in Glendale.
I took the 134.
Well, always nice to meet a fellow royal.
What can I do you for, Duke?
Well, you can tell your people back home to stop lein their cattle graze in our pastures, or pay the price to lease it.
Now, it's my understanding that you are now in charge
- of land management for the family.
- W...
I am?
Hey, your lordship, you need to control your cattle.
[Chuckles]
I just got the title yesterday, so I don't know who's grazing on what...
It's your title, so that means this is your problem.
Okay, um, tell you what, though.
Why don't you take it up with the Landingshires back in Scotland, because...
Well, they don't respond.
Probably too busy, you know, stealing other folks' lands and bedding down with their own livestock.
Sheep shaggers, the lot of them.
Sheep shaggers. [Chuckles] Wow.
Okay, look, I'll be damned if I'm gonna let you impugn the good name of the...
Oh, so who's gonna stop me from impugning, then, eh?
Oh, think you underestimate the power of litigation, my friend.
[Sighs] Of course.
A barrister.
Why would you want to settle things like a real man?
Listen, I'm gonna check back soon.
And I expect you to have this problem resolved by then, okay?
- Power of litigation?
- What did you want me to say?
- Oh, you embarrass me.
- [Scottish accent] Angry Shrek.
"Oh, donkey's on my property, grazing on my cattle.
That's okay."
[Normal voice] Okay.
- Mind if I get on?
- No, you should.
- All right.
Can you hold that?
Thanks.
- Daugherty:
Mm-hmm.
No more room.
Sheep shaggers.
Sorry.
[Elevator bell dings]
- Anita.
- Anita: [Chuckles] Hey, Damien.
It's, um, weird running into you here.
It's not that weird.
We're both lawyers.
Also, not that weird because I'm here looking for you.
Really?
This day just got better.
Actually, I have a message from Peter and Jared.
[Groans] Not that much better.
What do they want?
For you to come back to the firm.
They want me to come back to your firm?
I think you might've gotten that message wrong.
I heard them talking about how much Stanton wants you back, too.
Do you have an opinion on the subject?
I think it would be nice...
Working together.
Cindy:
All right, good work, ladies.
Remember, keep dancing.
There's nothing sexier than a sound mind and a sound body.
Yeah, totally.
That's my motto, too.
Hello.
Hi.
You were very flexible.
Love that twirly thing that you did up there.
[Chuckles] Uh, here's some of your stuff.
Girls at Kandy send their love.
Thanks.
I'm moving.
Going back to Wisconsin.
Why are you leaving?
Mm, you know...
Time for a fresh start.
Oh, God.
I've gotten that look before, you know.
This is where you say, "you're better than this.
Why don't you do something else other than stripping?"
Sorry.
You should take it as a compliment.
Yeah.
You know, when I was a kid, my dad and I...
we used to watch Michael Jordan play, and I remember seeing him take off from the foul line and dunk before coming down.
I decided that I was going to do that.
Yeah.
Well, when I realized that I wasn't going to be Jordan, obviously, I still wanted to do something.
You know, something that nobody else has done.
The double helix?
Mm-hmm.
So, you're comparing a move you do on the stripper pole to Jordan dunking?
[Chuckles]
Why don't you get on the pole?
Get on the pole.
Okay.
Ready.
- All right.
You got it?
Okay.
- Yeah, I got it.
You got it?
- All right.
- Yeah.
Now, kick your left leg and hook it around the pole.
That is physically impo... [Grunts]
What did I do to you?
Mm, I don't know.
Lost my court case?
[Grunts]
[Chuckles] Okay.
You move aside.
You're hopeless.
- That's the double helix?
- No.
Single.
All right, here it comes.
[Chuckles]
[Sighs, chuckles]
See?
That look.
That look that you just gave me... not the look from the guys who are just staring at my boobs... that's why I dance.
And now you're staring at my boobs.
Whoa, that's on you.
That is the power of suggestion.
You said "staring at my boobs,"
and... what am I supposed to do?
Excuse me.
Hmm?
Eyes are up here.
Oh, right.
Fair enough.
- Fair enough.
- You have to stay.
Stay.
You can get a job at any club in L.A.
I can't.
Cliff put the word out.
I'm blacklisted.
I'll sue him for interference with prospective business advantage.
First of all, the legal talk's kind of hot.
Not gonna lie.
But don't.
If you do, the other girls will get fired, too.
He can't fire all of them unless...
[Snaps fingers] What?
Don't leave just yet.
Wait, what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna take off from the foul line.
Every great labor movement had its great beginning, a time when the people stood up to tyranny.
The time is now.
You want us to form an exotic dancers' union?
Today, it was Cindy.
Tomorrow, it could be any of you.
Amelia, remember when you told me you had to work even though you had the stomach flu?
- Ugh.
- Was a tough shift.
That's not a lap dance I want!
And, David, you never got reimbursed for that Justin Bieber wig they told you to buy!
Damn shame.
Do you guys coming in the club to see Cliff in a G-string?
The place is here.
The time... now!
Strippers of the world...
- Exotic dancers.
- Exotic dancers of the world, unite!
Unite!
[Man clapping]
That was inspirational.
You guys inspired?
Can't believe you followed them here.
You know, that's intimidation.
You can't stop us from talking to them about organizing.
I say we call for a vote.
Who wants to unionize?
Show of hands.
Come on.
Show of hands.
Landslide.
Why don't you all head back so you don't catch colds?
Come on.
It's one thing to fire Cindy.
It's another thing to keep her out of every club in L.A.
Glad you reminded me.
[Camera shutter clicking]
By tonight, both of you will be banned from every strip club in L.A., too.
- And if you ever stop by my place again...
- Yeah, we know.
You'll have us arrested for trespassing.
Nope.
Not what I was gonna say.
You two have a good night.
Come on, man.
You took out Tyson.
Yeah.
Yeah, you better walk away!
- Idiot.
- What are you doing?
Jared:
Dude, we don't deserve this.
Peter:
After today with Cliff, we do.
No, no one deserves SR-17 forms.
If we have to do them, at least we can do them while we're fishing.
And drinking.
Good multitasking. [Chuckles]
[Sighs] God, this is terrible.
[Cellphone vibrates]
Dude, I think I got something.
Yeah, so do I.
Stanton wants us back at the house now.
He says we have visitors.
[Reel clicking] Dude.
- Fish on!
- Yeah!
Bring that bad boy in.
Come on!
- Oh, dude, I got a monster.
- Yeah, you do!
- Could be dinner.
- Think it's a mermaid.
I caught the fish, you clean the fish.
That Theules.
If you would've caught it...
Hey.
Welcome to our humble abode.
Oh.
Uh, actually, uh...
It's my humble abode.
We wanted to come by to say we're sorry about earlier.
We're sorry.
We had no right to risk your jobs like that.
- Are you guys still willing to help?
- Oh, yeah.
Call for another vote to unionize?
All:
Yes.
[Inhales sharply] Oh, are you all right, dear?
I sprained my elbow during a lap dance.
I suffered a similar injury tracking gorillas in Uganda.
Showdown with a silverback.
You fought a gorilla?
Ah.
It was hardly a fight.
Oh, listen, you should get some heat on that right away.
Is that a hot tub out there?
I do believe it is.
Perhaps you'd care to join me.
All of you.
Yeah.
Oh.
Hello, what's your name?
[Indistinct conversations]
How much do you know about labor law?
About as much as you know about being a duke.
But I know someone who does.
Wait.
You guys are serious?
- We want to unionize strippers.
- Of course you do.
You did this kind of work at your last firm, right?
There is a lot of paperwork, hoops you've got to jump through, getting certified, bylaws.
- It takes time.
- How much?
- Could be a year.
- Ooh.
Might need to compress that a little.
By like 360 days.
You want me to get them unionized in less than a week?
If you need that long.
Yeah, these girls put their asses on the line for us.
Literally.
[Sighs]
Um...
Well, I may have an idea.
- Let me do some research?
- Okay.
Hope I'm not intruding, Landingshire.
- A little bit.
- Stand down, friend.
My quarrel's not with you.
So, guess whose scrawny, inbred cattle is still fouling on my land?
- This guy.
- Aye.
Scrawny and inbred.
It's like you know him.
Does your valet do all your talking for you now, Landingshire?
- Valet?
- Okay, I'll handle this.
It's one thing if you're gonna insult our cattle.
It's even another if you're gonna besmirch the good name of the Landingshire clan.
He besmirched, all right.
But when you go after my friend, low-born as he may be,
- you're gonna... what?
- [Cellphone rings] Hello?
Go again?
Aye.
No, we're in here now.
Aye.
Aye.
- He's right here.
- We were talking.
These are fair dues.
Aye.
All right.
Fair dues.
Very well.
[Breathes deeply]
What's done is done.
There's nothing else to do but to throw down the Glasgow Gauntlet.
Consider yourself challenged.
Peter: [Exhales deeply]
Well, then I accept your [Scottish accent] Glasgow Gauntlet.
Good.
Fine.
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
Just...
You look really familiar.
You looking to get involved, big man?
Hey, brother, I'm on your side.
Aye.
Awesome.
Got something on your nose.
- Peter.
- Yeah.
- What the hell's a Glasgow Gauntlet?
- I don't know, but I think he just challenged you to a duel.
Oh, uh, Damien.
Damien.
What are you doing here?
Dropping off discovery to Anita.
I thought you usually spent Thursday mornings at your dojo.
Yes.
Uh, Sensei Barbara has gout.
I've got something to show you.
I was unpacking after my recent exile, and I found these.
Look at this.
[Chuckles] Oh.
[Chuckles]
That's our trip to Bangkok after my sophomore year in high school.
Ah.
Arguably, you were too young for certain aspects of it.
Mm.
That was a good trip.
It was a good trip.
Yeah.
You know, Damien, things simply aren't the same without you around here.
Oh.
My God, are these the SR-17s?
Oh, yeah.
Well, of course I gave them to Peter and Jared, but they made a complete and utter bullocks of them.
- They smell like fish.
- What?
Oh!
Ugh, that... that's what I'm talking about.
Well, I-I'll take care of these for you.
No, no, no.
You...
I would never ask.
Yeah, you didn't ask.
I-I offered.
Thank you, Damien.
Pipe fitters' union.
Longshoremen, no.
That is seven nos.
Not sure about Anita's idea to get an existing union to sponsor the girls.
- You know what you should be doing?
- What?
Preparing for your duel.
It's not gonna be a duel.
It's 2014.
Not to Daugherty.
He's going full "Braveheart."
Well, he's also full of sh...
Tony:
Excuse me.
Uh, you're Franklin and Bash?
Depends.
Who are you?
And what's in the box?
Uh, I'm Tony Philbin.
Huge fan of your work.
Jared:
It's always nice to meet a fan, Tony.
What's in the scary box?
Whoa.
Anita Haskins told me to come by.
Uh, I'm president of local 213.
We're a union in good standing.
- Oh.
- Tony!
Tony. [Chuckles]
Nice to meet you.
Jared Franklin.
- This is Peter Bash.
- Peter.
Hey.
Great to meet you.
Come on in.
We would be honored to stand shoulder-to-shoulder
- with your dancers.
- Oh, that's fantastic, Tony.
Uh, sorry, we're not familiar with local 213.
Uh, may I?
You may.
Please.
You got to be kidding me.
This is awesome.
This is ridiculous, even by Bash and Franklin standards.
Yeah, it's a little weird.
These, uh, puppets supposed to represent, uh, you two counselors?
Yes, your honor.
And again, Mr. Karp has absolutely no idea... [clears throat]
Um, what he means to say, your honor, is that Mr. Karp, while wise beyond his years, and...
- And handsome.
- ...and handsome, is understandably overlooking the fact that local 213 is an accredited union in good standing.
Yeah, well, how about y'all step back now?
- Getting a little freaky.
- Thank you.
That went well.
Take these back.
Judge Reid:
All right.
I'll bite.
What's the relationship between, uh, the puppeteers and the strippers?
Exotic dancer, your honor, and they're both entertainers, they both express themselves physically.
Manual dexterity being an essential skill for both artistic forms.
Your honor, you're not actually considering this?
I'm not sitting here stroking my chin just to look wise, Mr. Karp.
You do look wise, your honor.
Well, thank you.
Sir...
Are you willing to allow the dancers to come into the union as equals with the puppeteers?
[Imitating Jared] Ah, you betcha, Judge Reid.
All right, the next puppet that talks,
I'm gonna hold you all in contempt.
Okay, take your hand out of the puppet's ass.
Peter:
Put it... put it... put it away.
Your honor, when you take away the lawyers, the labor code sections, what this case really is about is what makes America great.
Exotic dancers and puppeteers.
- Our four fathers came here to escape...
- Did you really just say "four fathers"?
You can allow these groups of artists to unite.
Jared:
Or you can rule against America.
America.
Or you can follow the law.
Eh.
Okay.
I'm going to allow the dancers to, uh, join in association with the puppeteers.
[Spectators murmuring]
So, your honor, we can, uh, revisit Miss Maloney's workman's comp claim?
Yes, but get those things out of my court.
- I'm gonna have nightmares.
- Jared:
You got it, your honor.
Skedaddle.
Hey.
So, I'm back?
Halfway.
Okay.
Now what?
Now?
Now we go on strike.
All:
Strike!
Jared:
This is awesome.
- This is awesome!
- Dude.
Come on.
[Horn honks]
Serena, you can't give lap dances in the picket line.
She is standing, so technically, there's no lap.
- My bad.
- Hey.
Okay, so we've got girls who walked out from other clubs, and my friend who dances in San Diego...
she said they may walk, too.
Oh, great.
We started a revolution.
Yep.
Uh, Cindy, you got to keep them in line, though, 'cause we got reporters here.
Oh.
Oh, my God, what is Laurie doing with those puppets?
- What hasn't she done with those puppets?
- [Tires screech] Man:
Get out of the way!
Oh, we're causing quite a traffic problem.
Yeah, couple of these Fender benders, we may get the P.I. cases, too.
- Like old days.
- Just like old days.
Oh.
Oh.
Speaking of old.
- Damien Karp!
- Whoo!
Yoo-hoo-hoo!
Back from retirement!
Ignore the wrinkles, folks.
He can bend.
- You guys ever run out of toys?
- Not yet.
The club owners... [siren chirps]
- What was that?
The...
- Sorry, one more time?
[siren chirps] Oh, sorry.
Crime.
Go ahead.
The club owners are willing to have Cindy back.
They'll pay her medical bills, the pole's been replaced.
She just has to help call off this strike.
Great, we got three terms.
One...
Cindy gets her job back with back pay.
Two... medical, dental, and 401(K) for all the girls!
And let me guess the third.
I come back to the firm?
Karp, let me ask you.
Do you have a version of us at your new firm?
No, thank God.
You're an asshole, and I mean that with love.
Assholes like you and us...
We need someone, not only to love, but we need someone to hate.
It challenges us, it pushes us, it makes us better.
I'll get back to you.
Oh, and stop sending Anita to be your messenger.
She's too good for that.
I hate it when he leaves, but I love to watch him walk away!
- Welcome back, Damien.
- I'm not back.
I have a counter offer which I'm not going to discuss until my representative arrives.
You hired a lawyer to negotiate?
I can tell you the club owners have rejected your offer.
We'll be arguing that the club fell well within OSHA safety limits.
Ah, and here's my representative now.
- Mom?
Colleen?
- You hired my mom?
I missed you in court the other day, but I caught the tail end of you three going at it afterwards.
I told Damien that he was better than that.
So, you can imagine how surprised I was to learn that the two of you were picking on him.
Oh, uh, please...
please don't tell him the story about...
Sammy Sturgess used to tease Peter for being plump.
So, I invited Sammy and all the kids in Peter's class to do arts and crafts all day until everyone made up.
I didn't know you were a fat child, Peter, 'cause that explains a great deal.
I asked Damien to come by my office.
Your...
Sex-surrogate office?
Please tell me it wasn't for a session.
Oh, I would never charge Damien.
- Karp:
No.
Non-denial denial.
- It's okay, buddy.
It's okay.
Peter, Jared, is there something you want to say to Damien?
Like, uh, two magic words?
Pretty sure it's not the words he wants to hear.
Jared:
Dude, SR-17 forms.
[Sighs]
- Damien, I'm sorry.
- Sorry.
Well done.
And you, too, Stanton, for allowing this culture to exist on your watch.
Me?
But I've done nothing to warrant an apology.
Stanton.
Damien, I am sorry.
Well, I think I'll leave the business part to all of you.
I have a client... chronic masturbator.
Double session.
I'll walk you out.
Double session.
Sounds taxing.
Yeah.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna give you a double... these are my terms.
They're non-negotiable.
Mm.
Stanton.
Damien.
I just wanted you to know I read the terms that you gave to me, and I find them all acceptable.
Uh, a-and by the way, I added one myself.
I just hope you agree with it.
[Chuckles]
Bash and Franklin signed off on this?
[Chuckles]
Well, at the end of the day, it is my firm.
I hope one day, it'll be yours.
As soon as this case is over, I'll be back.
Good.
Oh, uh, don't you have to give notice?
I did... the day those two idiots told me you wanted me back.
Oh.
What about all that bluster, Colleen?

Karp:
For the last time, uh, I object.
Having these two strip is an affront to humanity.
Your honor, we totally agree.
We hold stripping... exotic dancing... in too high a regard to demonstrate ourselves.
Jared:
Your honor, we'd like to turn the poles over to our client, Cindy Maloney, and her Kandy coworker Amelia Cates.
Your honor, permission to simulate the conditions of a strip club.
[Hip-hop music plays]
This is the future of stripping if we don't tell club owners they need to invest their substantial profits into workplace safety.
In order to keep the girls safe, this is the attire they'll have to wear when they get on the stage.
And we ask you, would you invest your hard-earned ones...
Oh, come on.
Fives.
The duke is right.
Your hard-earned fives to watch this?

[Chuckles] What?
[Cheers and applause]
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, come on.
This is embarrassing.
Oh, please, no photos.
You know what?
Maybe a couple.
A few?
Okay.
Give the crowd what they want.
Give 'em what they want, right?
We got your back.
We got your back.
There you go.
Right, though?
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, my God.
Look at this guy.
All right.
Oh... hands!
Somebody get the bouncer.
- Sweetheart.
- I appreciate it.
Thank you very much.
You're all too kind.
It was a group effort, right?
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
Hey.
Thank you all.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Now you can go back to work, stay in L.A.
- Well...
And you don't have to worry about Cliff anymore, 'cause he's out.
Hey, there's our favorite puppet master.
I-I wanted you to have these as a token of our appreciation.
- Oh.
Oh, thanks, Tony.
- Thanks, buddy.
Why don't you go have some fun?
This is turning out to be a pretty good day.
Want to come to a royal ball tonight?
Yeah, that sounds fun.
Do you want me to ask Amelia if she wants to come, too?
Absolutely, because I want everyone to come.
Royal ball, coming-out party, tonight at our place.
Right.
[Cheers and applause]
Well, here's to the future of Infeld-Daniels.
Welcome back.
Peter:
Hey, hey.
Stanton:
Ah!
Oh, come in.
Join us.
What's up with these, sir?
Oh, a-as you can see, Damien's back, and I couldn't be more thrilled.
Peter:
We heard.
Sir, in paragraph 8b, we have to pay Damien $50 anytime we say something mean?
Stanton: [Chuckling] Yeah.
I was swayed by your mother's appeal for kindness.
I was swayed by your mom, too.
What do you say we hug it out, Pete?
Hey, what do you say you kiss my ass?
Oh!
Ah!
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
I'm afraid that's $50.
This is gonna be so easy.
- What?
- What a dick.
Hey!
Ah, ah!
- $100.
- What are you talking about?
I was m...
I s...
I was muttering to...
muttering counts?
- Mm-hmm.
- Seems like muttering counts.
- Oh, you really...
- So, you're not...
- you're not gonna say anything?
- I'm not gonna lose any money.
Right.
Here.
I will just say it was a strong move, having Colleen negotiate for you.
Very Franklin and Bash of you.
I suppose you mean that as a compliment.
I do.
- Welcome back, Damien.
- Welcome back.
To me.
To you.
[Chuckling] Oh, man.
Piece of... [Murmuring into glass]
- Mm!
50 bucks.
- Stanton:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no, no, no.
That's how I drink.
- 50 bucks.
- $50.
That was a toast.
I was making a toast.
- No. $50.
- Karp:
That was mean.
50 bucks... you can get 50 bucks when you pry it out of my...
[Laughter]
[Grunts]
- You look good.
- I know.
How do I look?
- You look great.
- Great.
Hey!
Your mom's here.
Cindy invited her.
- All right, let's do this.
- Whoa, dude.
- What?
- Present me.
- What?
- Present me.
- Pres... no.
- Come on, I'm royalty.
How many times do you get to come out?
- Come on.
- No.
Present me.
You owe me.
Presenting his most excellent, resplendent, and douchey Duke of...
Landingshire.
You call this a party?
Listen, Jared is not gonna be intimidated by you.
Hello, darling.
You know, I've always fancied Landingshire women.
Good hips, strong backs.
Wait a minute.
That's my mom you're talking...
Okay, I got this.
You want to duel?
Fine.
You got it.
You name the time and the place.
A duel?
You think we're animals?
Well, how do you want to settle this?
The Glasgow Gauntlet.
We drink to honor our deal.
Your family just agreed to a 100-year grazing-land lease of the dorway firth.
So...
We're good?
So, let's drink.
Last man standing wins.
- Oh.
- Oh.
Uh, your duke, I got this one.
- What?
- No.
Come on.
- No, no, I... h-he challenged me.
- Come on.
Come on.
- I'm the Duke.
- First of all, you're a lightweight.
Everyone knows that.
Second of all, I was flip-cup champion in college.
You have any problem with me acting as second in the double "g"?
No.
- Glasgow Gauntlet... see how I did that?
- Yeah, I got it.
Daugherty:
You know what?
I don't care.
I just want to get drunk.
Come on.
[Crowd cheering]
Whoo!
I declare the feud between Weddington and Landingshire over for good!
[Crowd cheers] Aah!
Hey, Jared, did you hear that?
[Laughs] I'll drink to that.
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, hey, guys, I have someth...
- Shh.
- I have something to say.
This woman...
This woman is an angel.
Angel!
[Crowd cheers]
All right.
All right.

You ready, twally?
Aye, you sheep shagger.

Objection Your Honour.
You're looking far too hot.
And I reject... cause I need a refill.
Both objections sustained so grab that bottle of tequila and get out of these stuffy suits.
- They are stuffy, aren't they?
- They are stuffy.
And meet us in the hot tub.
Oh my god.
- Okay.
- This is a court order.
I don't see we have any choice.
We see you in two minutes?
Peter, Jared.
Coleen.
What are you doing here?
Did you guys double book dates?
Oh, it's my fault.
- I just showed up uninvited.
- Yeah.
This is my friend Cindy, and she's in a lot of trouble.
She needs a lawyer.
Oh, that's great, 'cause, uh, we are... we are lawyers.
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't usually bust up people's dates.
One of us should go.
Yeah.
Sorry.
It's gonna be you.
She's his mom.
S04E06 Dance the Night Away
How did you and my mom meet?
Uh, through my work.
You're a sex surrogate, too?
A dancer over at Kandy's Strip Club.
- Oh.
On sunset.
- Surprisingly good salad bar there.
A lot of us go to Colleen just to talk, and she's helped me through a couple of tough situations.
And she returned the favor by teaching me how to pole dance.
- It's a great workout.
- I imagine it is.
Imagine less.
- Tell them about the pole.
- Okay.
So, I-I was working.
I have this move.
It's called the double helix.
So, I jumped on the pole, and it broke off in my hands.
I mean, it was rusted clear through.
- Ooh.
- So, I flew off the stage and landed headfirst into some guy's lap.
I mean, could you imagine?
- Uh-huh.
- Keep going.
I sprained my knee, couldn't work for a week, and now the new manager, Cliff, won't pay any of my medical bills.
And now he's suing her to pay for a new pole.
$1,300.
That's ridiculous.
I...
Know it probably sounds dumb, but, um, the girls at Kandy's... they really look up to me, and I look out for them the way you look out for me.
It doesn't sound dumb.
So you'll take the case?
Uh, we'll discuss it.
We'll take it.
That's wonderful.
- I said we'll discuss it.
- Yeah, we discussed it.
You said "we'll discuss it," I said "we'll take it."
- As long as we discussed it.
- Yeah.
Now that that's settled, seems like a shame to waste a perfectly good hot tub.
Colleen?
Oh, that's... that's sweet, Jared, but I don't have my suit.
Don't.
Mom, I love you, but you got to go home.
- Bye, Colleen.
- And next time, you got to call.
We'll call you tomorrow.
- Thanks.
- Nice to meet you.
What just happened?
There were four women here in the last half hour, and now it's just you and me.
- Want to hot tub?
- No.
And would you stop asking my mom to hot tub?
No.
Hey.
Hey.
Look at this.
Oh!
Admiring the sign, huh?
Infeld, Daniels...
Franklin Bash.
I still get tingles in my spine.
Well, word on the street is you're barely keeping this place afloat.
Is that the word on the street, Serpico?
What are you doing here?
You're representing the woman who got fired from Kandy's Strip Club?
Um...
Why?
Well, you can just serve it on me.
You're representing the strip club?
Oh, this is part of your "let me show Jared and Peter what a good lawyer I am" plan.
Oh, but if you go by the scoreboard...
- Which we do.
- We own you.
Not to mention the conflict of interest.
Right, of you going against a stripper when you so famously slept with that summer associate who was also a stripper.
It's not famous.
You know that Karp slept with a stripper?
Yeah, summer intern.
Famous!
We met before.
Juanita, right?
Just Anita.
There's no "wah."
- Dude.
That's kind of racist.
- Really racist.
Don't listen to them.
I never do.
Anita.
I will not make that mistake again.
Good.
Make sure that you don't, Damien.
Anita, infeld wants us in court in 10 minutes.
Oh, don't dawdle.
Run along.
Don't want to keep your master waiting.
Case dismissed!
Thanks for saving my ass again.
That's what we're here for, Ian.
I've never actually met a polo player before, not to mention one that got into a brawl during a game.
That son of a bitch was hooking me all day.
Well, that, and you finished off a fifth of Macallan's before the match.
Listen, there may be a bit of a problem with paying my legal fee.
What do you mean?
You're Scottish royalty.
You're... you're a duke.
Royalty's overrated, trust me.
You see?
Only a royal can say something like that.
Seriously.
I'm broke.
After this last incident, the family cut me loose.
All I've got left is my worthless title.
Well, actually, it's not worthless.
At my last firm, we represented the Danish royal family.
When there was family in-fighting, they were able to sell titles to satisfy debts.
Danes, total savages.
They got good money for them, too.
- Really?
- You really tired of being a duke?
Completely.
You want to be a duke?
This is insane, even for you.
Only if you think about it.
You're a duke?
Duke of Landingshire, to be exact.
How much were Ian's fees?
- 7 grand.
- Well, I did half the case.
I should be duke half the time.
That's the kind of reaction I'd expect from a commoner.
- No.
No, no, no, no, no.
- Royalty.
Come on.
- Open the door.
- It's common courtesy.
- Open the door.
- Get the door.
D-don't!
I'm a duke, you dick!
Come on, Cliff.
Be reasonable.
Give Cindy her job back, buy a new pole, pay her medical bills, and we'll all be done here.
That's it?
I'm sensing sarcasm.
You made me lose count.
Now, look, if I start paying out every time someone falls around here, this place will turn into a skating rink.
Girls slipping, saying they're hurt.
Unh-unh.
Bad business.
What's bad business is treating your employees like property.
Property.
All right, here's some business advice.
Get the hell out of my club before you get your faces pounded in.
And I hope you're hiring strippers at your firm because your girl Cindy... she's fired.
Fine.
We'll be suing your ass for wrongful termination.
Then we'll see who's fired.
Okay, that last part came out more aggressive than I wanted.
So, I will bid you adieu.
- Just get out of here.
- Okay.
That was all him.
Lawyers.
Oh, yes.
- Oh, sorry, sir.
- Sorry, we should've knocked.
Nonsense.
Come in, come in, come in.
Yoomi, this is Peter and Jared.
Yoomi's my pedicurist.
Yoomi inherited my poor, tired feet from her mother, who learned from the royal empress herself.
Yoomi, would you please excuse us?
Sorry, I-I thought you were, uh...
- No, no.
Please.
- Okay.
- You wanted to see us, sir?
- Yes.
I understand you've become a duke and that you procured the title in lieu of legal fees.
Thank you.
And I told him, I said legal fees are more important than...
Well done, Jared.
You know, it... it brings to mind my brush with royalty.
Summer nights with Lizzie, H.R.H.
Her royal highness.
Oh, of course I was just a 19-year-old boy, and I had to be smuggled into Buckingham Palace as a footman.
My God, she was a passionate woman.
But, of course, always formal.
Mm-hmm.
Which brings me to my point.
- There's a point?
- A man doesn't become royalty every day.
No.
See, this is a very, very special time.
Which is why I'd like to throw your royal coming-out party.
Ah.
You're finally coming out.
We'll do it at the beach house, huh?
Capital idea.
Thursday next?
- Seriously gonna kill you.
- Yes.
Uh, well, would you send Yoomi back in?
You got it.
Oh, by the way, boys,
I still haven't received the SR-17 business tax forms.
No.
W-well, we thought now that you're back with the firm...
Yeah, we thought you'd do them.
Yeah, like you did before Karp took them over.
Oh, I heard that Damien may have been here.
- Is that correct?
- He didn't stop in to see you?
Send Yoomi back in, would you?
Oh.
Yes, sir.
Hate doing SR-17s.
Remember how Karp used to do them?
Oh!
With the little line through the 7s.
- They were so perfect and elegant.
- I miss his 7s.
I don't like seeing Stanton like this.
He misses Karp.
Hey.
- Hi, how are you?
Hey.
- Morning.
So, I texted with Damien last night.
He thinks that the club owners are gonna back down.
Well, that is good news, but you texted Karp?
What's going on with the eyeliner?
Since when do you get all gussied up for court?
I always look like this.
- Oh, hey, hey.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hey.
- You know what?
I got that video of the bulldog puppy rolling down the hill.
You're right, it's hilarious.
Thank you.
Um, I'll, uh, I'll see you inside.
- Okay.
- Karpe diem.
- Karp-instein.
- Just the man we're looking for.
That's good.
I'm looking for you, and I... and I do.
I love it when you add syllables to the end of my name.
It's very funny.
What's the good word?
Your client ready to settle?
I talked to him, but he's dug in.
There is a silver lining.
Well, we love silver linings.
Almost as much as cute animal videos.
Oh, my God, L.O.L. They're hilarious.
But I think you're really gonna love this one, then.
The other club owners have banded together to make sure the case doesn't go forward, so they're gonna pay me double my rate and I get to kick both your asses, so win-win for me.
All right.
Oddly, I still miss him.
Are you looking up the cute puppy video?
Trying to.
Sounds good.
What is that?
Oh, God, is that your screen saver?
Sorry.
You weren't supposed to see that.
What is that?
It's nothing.
Mr. Franklin, Mr. Bash, you're representing a dancer from Kandy's Strip Club.
That's correct, your honor.
All right, full disclosure.
I have been to that establishment for the salad.
Baby corn, your honor, right?
It's amazing.
He picks them up and pretends that they're real ears of corn, and then he...
It's hilarious, yeah.
If you hadn't stolen it from the movie "Big."
True story...
Hanks got that from me.
- True story.
- Your honor, we move for immediate dismissal of the wrongful termination claim.
Okay.
Our esteemed opposing counsel is premature, your honor.
Kind of an issue with him.
We haven't even presented any facts yet, tiger.
The facts are irrelevant.
Are they?
You can't bring a wrongful termination suit unless you're an employee.
Right.
We can call 20 witnesses to prove Miss Maloney worked... as an independent contractor, who under section 3312 of the civil code cannot sue as an employee.
Independent contractor?
She's worked more than 40 hours a week.
There's no employment agreement, at least not with Kandy's Strip Club.
Your honor, if I may.
The dancers are allowed to pursue outside employment, which Miss Maloney does as a private workout instructor.
We ask that this be marked as defense exhibit "b."
Uh, your honor, could we...
Miss Maloney, I feel for you, but the law is the law.
The defense motion is granted.
Case dismissed.
How can they get away with that?
Because they ruled you weren't a real employee.
All right, this isn't real broken glass onstage?
Or what about this?
Torn medial vastus.
I mean, every dancer I know has injuries like these.
You just should've told us about the outside work earlier.
I didn't think it mattered.
I mean, they want us to do stuff like that.
Yes, of course.
To inoculate themselves in cases like this.
Miss Maloney.
Oh, Karp, look, if you're here to do a victory lap,
- you're not gonna finish it.
- Not at all, I just wanted you to know that I've convinced the club owners to return your personal belongings.
They'll be waiting for you at the club.
You're an angel.
Gentlemen.
We're sorry about this.
You've been great.
Really.
Um, I do have one last favor, though.
Name it.
Could you go to the club and pick my stuff up?
I just...
I can't.
Um... and tell the girls I said goodbye?
Cindy, maybe we can ask...
No.
No, you've... you were great.
Really, you've done enough.
Thank you.
You feel like we've done enough?
I feel like we're just getting started.
Hey, tell Cindy we're sorry, huh?
Yeah, I will.
I'll be back in an hour.
Did you, uh, did you talk to Anita?
She's on her way now.
Jared Franklin?
Guilty as charged.
Albert Daugherty.
You're the new Duke of Landingshire?
Yes, I am.
I'm the Duke of Weddington.
Our lands border the morrow river 10 miles south Inverness.
Oh.
You're a long way from home.
No, no.
Not really.
I live in Glendale.
I took the 134.
Well, always nice to meet a fellow royal.
What can I do you for, Duke?
Well, you can tell your people back home to stop lein their cattle graze in our pastures, or pay the price to lease it.
Now, it's my understanding that you are now in charge
- of land management for the family.
- W...
I am?
Hey, your lordship, you need to control your cattle.
I just got the title yesterday, so I don't know who's grazing on what...
It's your title, so that means this is your problem.
Okay, um, tell you what, though.
Why don't you take it up with the Landingshires back in Scotland, because...
Well, they don't respond.
Probably too busy, you know, stealing other folks' lands and bedding down with their own livestock.
Sheep shaggers, the lot of them.
Sheep shaggers.
Wow.
Okay, look, I'll be damned if I'm gonna let you impugn the good name of the...
Oh, so who's gonna stop me from impugning, then, eh?
Oh, think you underestimate the power of litigation, my friend.
Of course.
A barrister.
Why would you want to settle things like a real man?
Listen, I'm gonna check back soon.
And I expect you to have this problem resolved by then, okay?
- Power of litigation?
- What did you want me to say?
- Oh, you embarrass me.
- Angry Shrek.
"Oh, donkey's on my property, grazing on my cattle.
That's okay."
Okay.
- Mind if I get on?
- No, you should.
- All right.
Can you hold that?
Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.
No more room.
Sheep shaggers.
Sorry.
- Anita.
- Hey, Damien.
It's, um, weird running into you here.
It's not that weird.
We're both lawyers.
Also, not that weird because I'm here looking for you.
Really?
This day just got better.
Actually, I have a message from Peter and Jared.
Not that much better.
What do they want?
For you to come back to the firm.
They want me to come back to your firm?
I think you might've gotten that message wrong.
I heard them talking about how much Stanton wants you back, too.
Do you have an opinion on the subject?
I think it would be nice...
Working together.
All right, good work, ladies.
Remember, keep dancing.
There's nothing sexier than a sound mind and a sound body.
Yeah, totally.
That's my motto, too.
Hello.
Hi.
You were very flexible.
Love that twirly thing that you did up there.
Uh, here's some of your stuff.
Girls at Kandy send their love.
Thanks.
I'm moving.
Going back to Wisconsin.
Why are you leaving?
Mm, you know...
Time for a fresh start.
Oh, God.
I've gotten that look before, you know.
This is where you say, "you're better than this.
Why don't you do something else other than stripping?"
Sorry.
You should take it as a compliment.
Yeah.
You know, when I was a kid, my dad and I...
we used to watch Michael Jordan play, and I remember seeing him take off from the foul line and dunk before coming down.
I decided that I was going to do that.
Yeah.
Well, when I realized that I wasn't going to be Jordan, obviously, I still wanted to do something.
You know, something that nobody else has done.
The double helix?
So, you're comparing a move you do on the stripper pole to Jordan dunking?
Why don't you get on the pole?
Get on the pole.
Okay.
Ready.
- All right.
You got it?
Okay.
- Yeah, I got it.
You got it?
- All right.
- Yeah.
Now, kick your left leg and hook it around the pole.
That is physically impo...
What did I do to you?
Mm, I don't know.
Lost my court case?
Okay.
You move aside.
You're hopeless.
- That's the double helix?
- No.
Single.
All right, here it comes.
See?
That look.
That look that you just gave me... not the look from the guys who are just staring at my boobs... that's why I dance.
And now you're staring at my boobs.
Whoa, that's on you.
That is the power of suggestion.
You said "staring at my boobs,"
and... what am I supposed to do?
Excuse me.
Hmm?
Eyes are up here.
Oh, right.
Fair enough.
- Fair enough.
- You have to stay.
Stay.
You can get a job at any club in L.A.
I can't.
Cliff put the word out.
I'm blacklisted.
I'll sue him for interference with prospective business advantage.
First of all, the legal talk's kind of hot.
Not gonna lie.
But don't.
If you do, the other girls will get fired, too.
He can't fire all of them unless...
What?
Don't leave just yet.
Wait, what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna take off from the foul line.
Every great labor movement had its great beginning, a time when the people stood up to tyranny.
The time is now.
You want us to form an exotic dancers' union?
Today, it was Cindy.
Tomorrow, it could be any of you.
Amelia, remember when you told me you had to work even though you had the stomach flu?
- Ugh.
- Was a tough shift.
That's not a lap dance I want!
And, David, you never got reimbursed for that Justin Bieber wig they told you to buy!
Damn shame.
Do you guys coming in the club to see Cliff in a G-string?
The place is here.
The time... now!
Strippers of the world...
- Exotic dancers.
- Exotic dancers of the world, unite!
Unite!
That was inspirational.
You guys inspired?
Can't believe you followed them here.
You know, that's intimidation.
You can't stop us from talking to them about organizing.
I say we call for a vote.
Who wants to unionize?
Show of hands.
Come on.
Show of hands.
Landslide.
Why don't you all head back so you don't catch colds?
Come on.
It's one thing to fire Cindy.
It's another thing to keep her out of every club in L.A.
Glad you reminded me.
By tonight, both of you will be banned from every strip club in L.A., too.
- And if you ever stop by my place again...
- Yeah, we know.
You'll have us arrested for trespassing.
Nope.
Not what I was gonna say.
You two have a good night.
Come on, man.
You took out Tyson.
Yeah.
Yeah, you better walk away!
- Idiot.
- What are you doing?
Dude, we don't deserve this.
After today with Cliff, we do.
No, no one deserves SR-17 forms.
If we have to do them, at least we can do them while we're fishing.
And drinking.
Good multitasking.
God, this is terrible.
Dude, I think I got something.
Yeah, so do I.
Stanton wants us back at the house now.
He says we have visitors.
Dude.
- Fish on!
- Yeah!
Bring that bad boy in.
Come on!
- Oh, dude, I got a monster.
- Yeah, you do!
- Could be dinner.
- Think it's a mermaid.
I caught the fish, you clean the fish.
That Theules.
If you would've caught it...
Hey.
Welcome to our humble abode.
Oh.
Uh, actually, uh...
It's my humble abode.
We wanted to come by to say we're sorry about earlier.
We're sorry.
We had no right to risk your jobs like that.
- Are you guys still willing to help?
- Oh, yeah.
Call for another vote to unionize?
Yes.
Oh, are you all right, dear?
I sprained my elbow during a lap dance.
I suffered a similar injury tracking gorillas in Uganda.
Showdown with a silverback.
You fought a gorilla?
Ah.
It was hardly a fight.
Oh, listen, you should get some heat on that right away.
Is that a hot tub out there?
I do believe it is.
Perhaps you'd care to join me.
All of you.
Yeah.
Oh.
Hello, what's your name?
How much do you know about labor law?
About as much as you know about being a duke.
But I know someone who does.
Wait.
You guys are serious?
- We want to unionize strippers.
- Of course you do.
You did this kind of work at your last firm, right?
There is a lot of paperwork, hoops you've got to jump through, getting certified, bylaws.
- It takes time.
- How much?
- Could be a year.
- Ooh.
Might need to compress that a little.
By like 360 days.
You want me to get them unionized in less than a week?
If you need that long.
Yeah, these girls put their asses on the line for us.
Literally.
Um...
Well, I may have an idea.
- Let me do some research?
- Okay.
Hope I'm not intruding, Landingshire.
- A little bit.
- Stand down, friend.
My quarrel's not with you.
So, guess whose scrawny, inbred cattle is still fouling on my land?
- This guy.
- Aye.
Scrawny and inbred.
It's like you know him.
Does your valet do all your talking for you now, Landingshire?
- Valet?
- Okay, I'll handle this.
It's one thing if you're gonna insult our cattle.
It's even another if you're gonna besmirch the good name of the Landingshire clan.
He besmirched, all right.
But when you go after my friend, low-born as he may be,
- you're gonna... what?
- Hello?
Go again?
Aye.
No, we're in here now.
Aye.
Aye.
- He's right here.
- We were talking.
These are fair dues.
Aye.
All right.
Fair dues.
Very well.
What's done is done.
There's nothing else to do but to throw down the Glasgow Gauntlet.
Consider yourself challenged.
Well, then I accept your Glasgow Gauntlet.
Good.
Fine.
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
Just...
You look really familiar.
You looking to get involved, big man?
Hey, brother, I'm on your side.
Aye.
Awesome.
Got something on your nose.
- Peter.
- Yeah.
- What the hell's a Glasgow Gauntlet?
- I don't know, but I think he just challenged you to a duel.
Oh, uh, Damien.
Damien.
What are you doing here?
Dropping off discovery to Anita.
I thought you usually spent Thursday mornings at your dojo.
Yes.
Uh, Sensei Barbara has gout.
I've got something to show you.
I was unpacking after my recent exile, and I found these.
Look at this.
That's our trip to Bangkok after my sophomore year in high school.
Arguably, you were too young for certain aspects of it.
Mm.
That was a good trip.
It was a good trip.
Yeah.
You know, Damien, things simply aren't the same without you around here.
Oh.
My God, are these the SR-17s?
Oh, yeah.
Well, of course I gave them to Peter and Jared, but they made a complete and utter bullocks of them.
- They smell like fish.
- What?
Ugh, that... that's what I'm talking about.
Well, I-I'll take care of these for you.
No, no, no.
You...
I would never ask.
Yeah, you didn't ask.
I-I offered.
Thank you, Damien.
Pipe fitters' union.
Longshoremen, no.
That is seven nos.
Not sure about Anita's idea to get an existing union to sponsor the girls.
- You know what you should be doing?
- What?
Preparing for your duel.
It's not gonna be a duel.
It's 2014.
Not to Daugherty.
He's going full "Braveheart."
Well, he's also full of sh...
Excuse me.
Uh, you're Franklin and Bash?
Depends.
Who are you?
And what's in the box?
Uh, I'm Tony Philbin.
Huge fan of your work.
It's always nice to meet a fan, Tony.
What's in the scary box?
Whoa.
Anita Haskins told me to come by.
Uh, I'm president of local 213.
We're a union in good standing.
- Oh.
- Tony!
Tony.
Nice to meet you.
Jared Franklin.
- This is Peter Bash.
- Peter.
Hey.
Great to meet you.
Come on in.
We would be honored to stand shoulder-to-shoulder
- with your dancers.
- Oh, that's fantastic, Tony.
Uh, sorry, we're not familiar with local 213.
Uh, may I?
You may.
Please.
You got to be kidding me.
This is awesome.
This is ridiculous, even by Bash and Franklin standards.
Yeah, it's a little weird.
These, uh, puppets supposed to represent, uh, you two counselors?
Yes, your honor.
And again, Mr. Karp has absolutely no idea...
Um, what he means to say, your honor, is that Mr. Karp, while wise beyond his years, and...
- And handsome.
- ...and handsome, is understandably overlooking the fact that local 213 is an accredited union in good standing.
Yeah, well, how about y'all step back now?
- Getting a little freaky.
- Thank you.
That went well.
Take these back.
All right.
I'll bite.
What's the relationship between, uh, the puppeteers and the strippers?
Exotic dancer, your honor, and they're both entertainers, they both express themselves physically.
Manual dexterity being an essential skill for both artistic forms.
Your honor, you're not actually considering this?
I'm not sitting here stroking my chin just to look wise, Mr. Karp.
You do look wise, your honor.
Well, thank you.
Sir...
Are you willing to allow the dancers to come into the union as equals with the puppeteers?
Ah, you betcha, Judge Reid.
All right, the next puppet that talks,
I'm gonna hold you all in contempt.
Okay, take your hand out of the puppet's ass.
Put it... put it... put it away.
Your honor, when you take away the lawyers, the labor code sections, what this case really is about is what makes America great.
Exotic dancers and puppeteers.
- Our four fathers came here to escape...
- Did you really just say "four fathers"?
You can allow these groups of artists to unite.
Or you can rule against America.
America.
Or you can follow the law.
Okay.
I'm going to allow the dancers to, uh, join in association with the puppeteers.
So, your honor, we can, uh, revisit Miss Maloney's workman's comp claim?
Yes, but get those things out of my court.
- I'm gonna have nightmares.
- You got it, your honor.
Skedaddle.
Hey.
So, I'm back?
Halfway.
Okay.
Now what?
Now?
Now we go on strike.
Strike!
This is awesome.
- This is awesome!
- Dude.
Come on.
Serena, you can't give lap dances in the picket line.
She is standing, so technically, there's no lap.
- My bad.
- Hey.
Okay, so we've got girls who walked out from other clubs, and my friend who dances in San Diego...
she said they may walk, too.
Oh, great.
We started a revolution.
Yep.
Uh, Cindy, you got to keep them in line, though, 'cause we got reporters here.
Oh.
Oh, my God, what is Laurie doing with those puppets?
- What hasn't she done with those puppets?
- Get out of the way!
Oh, we're causing quite a traffic problem.
Yeah, couple of these Fender benders, we may get the P.I. cases, too.
- Like old days.
- Just like old days.
Oh.
Oh.
Speaking of old.
- Damien Karp!
- Whoo!
Yoo-hoo-hoo!
Back from retirement!
Ignore the wrinkles, folks.
He can bend.
- You guys ever run out of toys?
- Not yet.
The club owners...
- What was that?
The...
- Sorry, one more time?
Oh, sorry.
Crime.
Go ahead.
The club owners are willing to have Cindy back.
They'll pay her medical bills, the pole's been replaced.
She just has to help call off this strike.
Great, we got three terms.
One...
Cindy gets her job back with back pay.
Two... medical, dental, and 401 for all the girls!
And let me guess the third.
I come back to the firm?
Karp, let me ask you.
Do you have a version of us at your new firm?
No, thank God.
You're an asshole, and I mean that with love.
Assholes like you and us...
We need someone, not only to love, but we need someone to hate.
It challenges us, it pushes us, it makes us better.
I'll get back to you.
Oh, and stop sending Anita to be your messenger.
She's too good for that.
I hate it when he leaves, but I love to watch him walk away!
- Welcome back, Damien.
- I'm not back.
I have a counter offer which I'm not going to discuss until my representative arrives.
You hired a lawyer to negotiate?
I can tell you the club owners have rejected your offer.
We'll be arguing that the club fell well within OSHA safety limits.
Ah, and here's my representative now.
- Mom?
Colleen?
- You hired my mom?
I missed you in court the other day, but I caught the tail end of you three going at it afterwards.
I told Damien that he was better than that.
So, you can imagine how surprised I was to learn that the two of you were picking on him.
Oh, uh, please...
please don't tell him the story about...
Sammy Sturgess used to tease Peter for being plump.
So, I invited Sammy and all the kids in Peter's class to do arts and crafts all day until everyone made up.
I didn't know you were a fat child, Peter, 'cause that explains a great deal.
I asked Damien to come by my office.
Your...
Sex-surrogate office?
Please tell me it wasn't for a session.
Oh, I would never charge Damien.
- No.
Non-denial denial.
- It's okay, buddy.
It's okay.
Peter, Jared, is there something you want to say to Damien?
Like, uh, two magic words?
Pretty sure it's not the words he wants to hear.
Dude, SR-17 forms.
- Damien, I'm sorry.
- Sorry.
Well done.
And you, too, Stanton, for allowing this culture to exist on your watch.
Me?
But I've done nothing to warrant an apology.
Stanton.
Damien, I am sorry.
Well, I think I'll leave the business part to all of you.
I have a client... chronic masturbator.
Double session.
I'll walk you out.
Double session.
Sounds taxing.
Yeah.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna give you a double... these are my terms.
They're non-negotiable.
Mm.
Stanton.
Damien.
I just wanted you to know I read the terms that you gave to me, and I find them all acceptable.
Uh, a-and by the way, I added one myself.
I just hope you agree with it.
Bash and Franklin signed off on this?
Well, at the end of the day, it is my firm.
I hope one day, it'll be yours.
As soon as this case is over, I'll be back.
Good.
Oh, uh, don't you have to give notice?
I did... the day those two idiots told me you wanted me back.
Oh.
What about all that bluster, Colleen?
Well played.
For the last time, uh, I object.
Having these two strip is an affront to humanity.
Your honor, we totally agree.
We hold stripping... exotic dancing... in too high a regard to demonstrate ourselves.
Your honor, we'd like to turn the poles over to our client, Cindy Maloney, and her Kandy coworker Amelia Cates.
Your honor, permission to simulate the conditions of a strip club.
This is the future of stripping if we don't tell club owners they need to invest their substantial profits into workplace safety.
In order to keep the girls safe, this is the attire they'll have to wear when they get on the stage.
And we ask you, would you invest your hard-earned ones...
Oh, come on.
Fives.
The duke is right.
Your hard-earned fives to watch this?
What?
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, come on.
This is embarrassing.
Oh, please, no photos.
You know what?
Maybe a couple.
A few?
Okay.
Give the crowd what they want.
Give 'em what they want, right?
We got your back.
We got your back.
There you go.
Right, though?
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, my God.
Look at this guy.
All right.
Oh... hands!
Somebody get the bouncer.
- Sweetheart.
- I appreciate it.
Thank you very much.
You're all too kind.
It was a group effort, right?
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
Hey.
Thank you all.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Now you can go back to work, stay in L.A.
- Well...
And you don't have to worry about Cliff anymore, 'cause he's out.
Hey, there's our favorite puppet master.
I-I wanted you to have these as a token of our appreciation.
- Oh.
Oh, thanks, Tony.
- Thanks, buddy.
Why don't you go have some fun?
This is turning out to be a pretty good day.
Want to come to a royal ball tonight?
Yeah, that sounds fun.
Do you want me to ask Amelia if she wants to come, too?
Absolutely, because I want everyone to come.
Royal ball, coming-out party, tonight at our place.
Right.
Well, here's to the future of Infeld-Daniels.
- Welcome back.
- Hey, hey.
Ah!
Oh, come in.
Join us.
What's up with these, sir?
Oh, a-as you can see, Damien's back, and I couldn't be more thrilled.
We heard.
Sir, in paragraph 8b, we have to pay Damien $50 anytime we say something mean?
Yeah.
I was swayed by your mother's appeal for kindness.
I was swayed by your mom, too.
What do you say we hug it out, Pete?
Hey, what do you say you kiss my ass?
Oh!
Ah!
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
I'm afraid that's $50.
This is gonna be so easy.
- What?
- What a dick.
Hey!
Ah, ah!
- $100.
- What are you talking about?
I was m...
I s...
I was muttering to...
muttering counts?
- Mm-hmm.
- Seems like muttering counts.
- Oh, you really...
- So, you're not...
- you're not gonna say anything?
- I'm not gonna lose any money.
Right.
Here.
I will just say it was a strong move, having Colleen negotiate for you.
Very Franklin and Bash of you.
I suppose you mean that as a compliment.
I do.
- Welcome back, Damien.
- Welcome back.
To me.
To you.
Oh, man.
Piece of...
- Mm!
50 bucks.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no, no, no.
That's how I drink.
- 50 bucks.
- $50.
That was a toast.
I was making a toast.
- No. $50.
- That was mean.
50 bucks... you can get 50 bucks when you pry it out of my...
- You look good.
- I know.
How do I look?
- You look great.
- Great.
Hey!
Your mom's here.
Cindy invited her.
- All right, let's do this.
- Whoa, dude.
- What?
- Present me.
- What?
- Present me.
- Pres... no.
- Come on, I'm royalty.
How many times do you get to come out?
- Come on.
- No.
Present me.
You owe me.
Presenting his most excellent, resplendent, and douchey Duke of...
Landingshire.
You call this a party?
Listen, Jared is not gonna be intimidated by you.
Hello, darling.
You know, I've always fancied Landingshire women.
Good hips, strong backs.
Wait a minute.
That's my mom you're talking...
Okay, I got this.
You want to duel?
Fine.
You got it.
You name the time and the place.
A duel?
You think we're animals?
Well, how do you want to settle this?
The Glasgow Gauntlet.
We drink to honor our deal.
Your family just agreed to a 100-year grazing-land lease of the dorway firth.
So...
We're good?
So, let's drink.
Last man standing wins.
Uh, your duke, I got this one.
- What?
- No.
Come on.
- No, no, I... h-he challenged me.
- Come on.
Come on.
- I'm the duke.
- First of all, you're a lightweight.
Everyone knows that.
Second of all, I was flip-cup champion in college.
You have any problem with me acting as second in the double "g"?
No.
- Glasgow Gauntlet... see how I did that?
- Yeah, I got it.
You know what?
I don't care.
I just want to get drunk.
Come on.
Whoo!
I declare the feud between Weddington and Landingshire over for good!
Hey, Jared, did you hear that?
I'll drink to that.
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, hey, guys, I have someth...
I have something to say.
This woman...
This woman is an angel.
Angel!
All right.
All right.
Round 12.
You ready, twally?
Aye, you sheep shagger.
Yes!
I win!
I don't know.
I do.
I mean, just look at yourself.
I can't.
Well, I can, and you are a wonderful, handsome young man who has everything to offer the right woman, and if this Ellen doesn't get it, then somebody else will.
You're the best.
I feel like I should be paying you for this session.
Well, I charge $200 an hour, and we've been talking for, uh...
Okay, I can't pay you for this session.
I'll pay you with a dance.
Deal.
We're both wearing dresses.
You can lead.
This is better than not dancing.
- Previously on
- I'm sober now.
I'm in a program.
I'm seeing a therapist.
I was pretty sure you never wanted to see me again.
And then, all of a sudden, you know, there you are.
Why don't you forget about me like I've already forgotten about you?
I've been suspended.
I will call my dad.
Hey, Dad.
Hello, Will.
- Will
- Yeah?
It's really nice to finally meet you.
Yeah, likewise, I'm sure.
If Alex chose to act unethically on your behalf, he shouldn't be surprised there are consequences.
And he should be man enough to accept them.
- Who are you?
- He's just a friend
- of Daddy's, honey.
- You never told her
- she had a brother?
- I won't let you disappoint her the way you've disappointed everyone else in your life.
Oh, uh, by the way, your wife... she barely touched her food, and, uh, what with that and the slight tremor, my guess is Adderall.
You might look into that.
- Your dad came through big-time.
- What?
Back in!
Thank you.
Oh.
No problem.
- Thank you for coming so early.
- No problem.
And before anyone else gives you the wrong idea,
- it was an accident.
- Isn't it always?
I know, right?
Some people are so judgmental.
Like a... judgmental person might say it's odd to have a grizzly bear in your living room.
Oh, Yanni's a brown bear, actually.
People make that mistake all the time.
See, brown bears have longer hair.
Right.
Well, let's hope he doesn't shed on the couch.
Ooh.
Easy, Daisy.
Dr. Rush is just here to help Daddy.
- Hey.
- I swear, it was an accident.
Lucky for you, accident's my middle name.
Can I take a look?
Oh.
Looks like you lost a lot of blood there.
Yeah.
Well, these teeth marks are clean and shallow, like a razor.
Hold that.
Thank you.
That is not a dog bite.
I told you a million times, he needs to stay in his bedroom.
I'm doing my best.
I'm trying.
Trying without locking the door isn't trying.
He's dangerous, Kent.
That stupid thing hates me.
He doesn't hate you.
Sometimes he just wants a change of scenery.
That's all.
He loves you.
We both love you.
Why can't you accept that?
No, if you loved me, you would've remembered to lock the goddamn door.
And here comes the drama.
Guys, guys, just... in order to prescribe the appropriate antibiotic,
I need to know exactly who or what bit you, okay?
Was it Yanni?
Oh, please.
Yanni's a cuddlemuffin.
It was General Westmoreland.
General Westmoreland is a...
Monitor lizard.
Of course he is.
There's an anticoagulant in the lizard's saliva, so this is a special bandage to help activate the clotting cascade.
Okay.
Good as new.
Hon, can you corral John Waters while I pay Dr. Rush?
Yes, I can.
Thank you so much, Doctor.
You're welcome.
I'm just gonna write you a prescription for amoxicillin.
- You know, you took a big risk not going straight to the E.R.
- Oh, believe me,
I wanted to.
But he doesn't have any permits for these animals.
And you live with these things why?
Kent's a wrangler for the studios.
But almost all the animals in movies and TV are CG now, so he's started bringing them home.
So they're not only dangerous;
they're unemployed.
I'm telling you, it's putting a huge strain on our relationship.
I...
I really don't know how much more I can take, Doctor.
I mean, I love Kent and I support him, but sometimes I just...
I think about... you know.
Okay.
Good talk.
No, Doc, no.
I was just thinking out loud.
Come on, John Waters.
Daddy's in a bad mood.
Let's get a drink at the algae pond.
That a boy.
Is there any way we can take care of this... permanently?
What do you mean, like a family trip to the zoo?
See?
You were thirsty.
Such a thirsty little boy.
I was thinking more of a medical solution.
You want me to... assassinate the general?
Mmm.
There's another 15 grand in it for you.
Well, um...
I'd need a distraction.
There's a rib eye in the fridge.
Perfect.
Cash first.
Okay.
All right.
Nice and easy.
Nice and easy.
Toss him the steak here.
That's it.
Attaboy.
Good.
There you go.
All right.
You sure about this?
All right.
Attaboy.
Oh, my God.
What have you done?
Murderer.
You're a murderer.
- Kent, it's fine.
- No, it's not fine.
I'm calling the police.
I'm calling my lawyer.
I'm calling Betty White.
Kent, relax.
You're not a doctor.
- You're a hit man.
- Kent, shh, shh.
Just...
The general isn't dead, all right?
- What?
- I just sedated him.
- I don't understand.
- He'll wake up in a few hours.
I thought it might buy you two some time to... work your shit out.
Why would you do that?
Because somebody just did me a solid, and I'm experimenting with paying it forward for a change.
Plus, your partner paid me 15 grand to do it, so, you know, think of it as couples therapy.
You're insane.
Yeah, I think it's fair to say we're both a little off.
So, tonight, the Chateau?
Dinner's on you?
No.
Dinner's on you, bro.
What?
I got you your job back.
I thought this was a celebration.
Your dad got me my job back.
You should be thanking him for me.
I'm not sure I follow.
All right, look, this is what we do.
We go to In-N-Out, and then I got you.
Yeah, awful wine list.
Listen, you win.
I'll get dinner, okay?
Listen, I got someone on the other line.
- I'll see you tonight.
- Cool.
Later.
Peace out, brother.
Hello.
This is Will Rush.
Hi, Will.
It's Corrine.
Corrine...
Corrine?
Five-nine?
Blonde?
Okay, well, that's really not helping.
FormerSC Sg Girl?
Mmm, well, that narrows it down to, what, six?
Married to your father.
Oh.
Corrine.
Hi.
What's up?
Um, I thought we could have lunch.
What, after that dinner the other night,
- you want to have lunch?
- Yeah.
Why?
You some kind of masochist?
No.
I just feel really badly about the way things went with your father.
Well, don't, all right?
It's not your fault.
And, uh, besides, it all worked out anyway.
Will, you have a sister that still doesn't know you exist.
I wouldn't say it worked out.
Have lunch with me.
Vista at 1:00?
Yeah, I-I don't have much of an appetite, so...
We are family now.
All right.
Okay, look, I-I'll make a reservation.
I already did.
I'll see you then.
Future ex-girlfriend?
Future ex-stepmom, actually.
Oh.
So the dinner went well?
Don't ask me.
- What does that mean?
- Well,
I went there to ask my father for a favor.
We had a huge fight.
And then he did me the favor.
Why?
I have no idea.
Well, ambiguity trumps disaster.
Yeah, I guess.
I'm just glad the whole thing's over, to be honest.
Ooh.
Isabel Thoreau's Euro facial peel.
Oh, God.
I wrote that scrip out of guilt and shame.
Please make sure I'm not here when she comes to get it.
Already took the possibility of postcoital awkwardness into account.
Her assistant is picking it up.
Good.
Oh.
What is that?
- He likes shiny things.
- Yeah.
It's your lifetime membership to the Tolkin House.
Congratulations.
Oh.
You're turning down unlimited alcohol and a harem of STD-free massage therapists?
Yeah.
Let's just say I'm not a fan of the clientele.
You saw J.P. there?
Did you?
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you tell me?
Because it wasn't a big deal.
Eve.
It wasn't.
What did he say?
Nothing.
Just... that he's sober now.
Please tell me you didn't fall for that.
It doesn't matter.
He was just trying to apologize, and then I pretended to listen, and then I bounced.
Stay away from him, all right?
Why would I want to go anywhere near him?
I'm just saying, stay away.
And I'm just saying I'm different now.
Okay?
Rush.
Seriously.
It was okay.
Nothing about J.P. Harris is okay.
Thank you.
Yeah, it's, uh... it's funny.
I didn't really take you for a beer drinker.
I didn't take you for a decent human being.
Well, I'm a hooker with a heart of gold.
Your father says you're a narcissistic hedonist who doesn't care about anybody but himself.
That's very accurate.
And then I met you.
And I saw a man eager to connect with a little sister he'd never met.
A man willing to swallow his own pride and come crawling to his father... who he hasn't spoken to in six years... just to help a friend.
Yeah, well, we all have our moments of weakness, don't we?
So what about me?
Am I what you expected?
Actually, not at all.
I thought you'd be a recycled Real Housewife with, uh, enormous implants and a trout pout, who cared about shopping, redecorating and boning her Pilates instructor.
Well, I do love shopping and redecorating.
Pilates is for pussies.
I much prefer boxing.
Boxing?
Great.
Well, uh, here's to mistaken impressions, then.
Yo, you got the shit?
I got the primo shit.
Best '70s movie drug word ever.
It's nice to finally meet you face-to-face.
Same.
You got here quick.
Isabel Thoreau couldn't wait.
So that means I couldn't wait.
Hey, what is this stuff, anyway?
Phospholipids, grapefruit extract, and a cocktail of retinoids that I can't pronounce.
It's, like, impossible to get.
Except for you.
Except for me.
Which makes you the primo shit.
We both know how much your father hates dancing, right?
I mean, he will not dance.
But Lily came home from the country club and she said there was this father-daughter dance, and your dad's like,
"Yeah." They took lessons.
- No shit.
- Ever since she came along, your father's gotten very... surprising.
Yeah, well, he certainly surprised me when he did what he did for Alex.
I mean, I figured when we left the house the other day...
Well, you know.
Will, your dad...
What?
He... he's not all bad.
No, I think it's been fairly well-established that I'm the all-bad one in the family.
It hurts you, doesn't it?
What... his disapproval?
No, not at all.
Will, I married a man more than 20 years older than I am.
I have more than my fair share of daddy issues.
Don't bullshit me.
It hurts.
What exactly do you want here?
I want you and your father to figure your shit out.
Because Oprah said to?
No, because I have a daughter with a very controlling man, and Lord help me if she turns out half as... interesting as you.
I want your father to evolve.
And healing things between the two of you will be a big step toward that.
Well, I would love to help, Corrine, but... in order to do that, I would actually have to give a shit what my father thought and felt about me.
And I don't.
Oh.
Got to go.
A patient.
Sorry.
You know, you're more alike than you think.
Take care.
So, where do you like to go?
Go?
Uh, when you go out.
- Roger Room?
Harvard and Stone?
- Oh.
The New Beverly Cinema?
Come on.
No, I mean, seriously.
I...
I don't really go out that much.
And Rush has been busy for, like, ever, so...
Well, listen...
Yeah?
Uh, once a week,
I hang out with this group of assistants.
We go to a bar, shit talk our bosses and drink until someone pukes.
Sounds... riveting.
Come with us.
It's tonight.
I don't think so.
The New Beverly has a double feature.
Raymond Chandler.
Big Sleep, Long Goodbye.
I mean..
But thank you.
Excuse me.
Hello?
You rang?
Yes, um...
We got a call on the private line from a guy whose girlfriend partied too hard.
Well, that's possibly the most succinct diagnosis I've ever heard.
They're in room 23 at the Ramble Inn near downtown.
Where rockers and their women have partied too hard for three decades.
I'm texting you directions now.
No, no need to, I'll just follow the trail of broken dreams.
Hey, did you make my dinner reservation?
Yes.
I have you at 8:00 p.m.
with Alex at the Chateau.
Corner table, away from the poseurs, in sight of the bar.
You got someone there with you?
How could you tell?
Because you sound weird.
Is it Isabel's assistant?
Yes, it's Isabel's assistant, Lucas.
Oh, I saw him lurking around when I was over there.
He's kind of cute, right?
He's, um...
No, um...
Which means yes.
Put me on speaker.
No.
Speaker, speaker, speaker, speaker, speaker.
Speaker.
Speaker.
Speaker, speaker, speaker, speaker, speaker, speaker...
Hey, Lucas, can you hear me?
Uh, hi.
Yes.
Hi, Dr. Rush.
Hey.
You should ask Eve out.
Rush.
You know, I just did.
And she shot me down.
Oh.
What are you doing?
You need to go out with someone your own age.
Be 27 for once.
- I'm 25.
- Whatever.
Listen, you haven't been on a date since we met.
All right?
Since we met.
Doctor's orders.
Go.
It is now apparently my job to say yes.
- So, um, in the name of my work ethic...
- Great.
It's a bar in K-town.
I will text you the address.
Thanks.
You the doc?
Yes, I am.
All right.
Where's your lady?
Inside.
Bathroom.
Your girlfriend looks like shit.
All right, so what the hell's going on here?
I'm Roland Valdez.
I'm an authorized bail enforcement officer for the state of California.
Well, congratulations.
Hey, w-what are you doing?
- Calling an ambulance.
- No, no, no.
No hospitals, no.
I'm a bounty hunter.
That scumbag jumped bail.
Armed robbery.
I tracked him to this shit hole, and when I tried take him in, he got feisty and I was forced to shoot him.
- Forced, right.
- I did what I had to.
Now I got six hours to get him to Bakersfield or I'm not gonna get my money, so I don't have time for any hospitals.
So why the sick girlfriend story?
I didn't know if you'd come.
Some people have the wrong idea...
About people who shoot people?
Yeah, please try and forgive us.
Are you gonna fix him up or not?
I don't get paid if he's dead.
- Six grand.
- Your assistant said three.
Yeah, that was for a passed-out cokehead.
- Liars pay double.
- Six grand?
I'm only getting 15 to bring this kid in.
Well, you have all my sympathy.
Three.
All right.
Uncuff him.
There's the slug.
Most of it, anyway.
Hollow point?
He's bleeding more than before.
That's 'cause you nicked a vein.
Don't worry, you'll get your money.
All right.
We're good.
Hold this.
On there.
Hard.
Pick it up.
Yeah.
Man, Raoul said you were the best.
That's just some serious shit.
How do you know Raoul?
I took him in on an aggravated assault warrant last year.
He's good people.
All right.
Thanks, Doc.
Look, I know I lied before, and I'm sorry.
But trust me, this guy's bad news.
You did a good thing.
Yeah?
Well, now it's your turn to do a good thing.
Lose my number.
Please tell me you're pre-gaming by smoking that big fatty I gave you.
Rush, it's Laurel.
Oh...
Hey, girl.
Can you come over?
When?
Now?
Yeah, it's about Alex.
Sure, yeah, I-I'll, uh, be right there.
Hey.
Our dinner isn't till 8:00, bro.
What are you doing here so early?
Ask Laurel.
You two are taking a break.
- What?
- What?
Not forever.
Just for a little while.
Until my husband gets his priorities straight.
Uh, Laurel, you can't expect to put a ban on a friendship that's twice as long as your marriage.
I don't care how long you guys have been friends.
It's time to get real.
Are you gonna say something about this?
- I've got this.
- Well, get it, then.
Listen, babe, I know you're still upset about what happened, but... it's over.
Until it happens again.
See, that's the thing.
It's not gonna happen again.
I take good care of this family.
And you need to stop trying to control everything and simply appreciate what you have.
Baby, I do appreciate what I've got.
That's why I'm trying to protect it.
You can protect it all you want, but you don't pick my friends.
It's time that you start showing me some respect.
Choosing him over your family shows me that you have no idea what the word "respect" really means.
- Maybe I should go...
- No, you sit.
- Okay.
- What kind of friend would put everything that you hold dear into so much jeopardy?
Do you ever think of that?
Yeah, I got to go.
You don't have to go.
Uh... just tell me what happens, okay?
Oh, and, uh, Laurel, you know what really pisses me off?
You could have told me on the phone.
Tell me something good.
The Ramble Inn guy called again.
No, I said "something good."
What the hell does he want now?
He said you screwed up, the guy's still bleeding and you need to go back.
I thought it was a girl.
Yeah, well, looks like the private line's been compromised.
Is everything okay?
Uh, um...
Never mind.
It's a long story.
Uh... can you cancel the Chateau for tonight?
What about your big celebration?
Yeah, well, Laurel had other plans.
Come in.
Okay.
Fix him up.
All right.
What the hell's going on here?
Just fix him up, now.
Hold on a second, okay?
I'd like to know who I'm working for.
'Cause this guy, he told me he was a bounty hunter and you were a criminal he was taking back to Bakersfield.
Yeah, that's all true.
Except I'm the bounty hunter.
All right, tell me something.
Yeah.
If you're the bounty hunter, then why are you pointing the gun at me?
I just want to make sure that you... you know... you do your job.
Look, this knife's in pretty deep.
We got to get this guy to a hospital or he's gonna die.
No, we can't do that.
No hospitals.
All right, look... they've already got you for armed robbery... you don't want to add a murder charge to your troubles.
All right, well,
I may not be a bounty hunter, but... at least you're a real doctor.
Don't, don't... touch it!
"Sundown"?
Is that some kind of code?
No.
It's my friend.
Bullshit, man!
You brought the cops!
There's nobody there, I swear.
What's he saying?
"I left the house.
"Meet me at the hotel bar.
Screw Laurel."
Why's he called "Sundown"?
It's the name of the only black pilot in Top Gun.
I love that movie.
Yeah, modern classic.
Shit.
What's the matter with him now?
His lung's collapsing.
Fix him!
Okay, we can take care of this.
No!
Just fix him up like I said!
Look, I got a guy... who can take him to Cedars;
no one will know.
Look, trust me, it's not a murder.
You call the cops, you're dead.
My boss has me doing the most menial crap lately.
It's like I'm his wife.
Except, he doesn't sleep with his wife.
As opposed to you, Kendall, who's simply screwing her way to the middle,
I have an actual plan that's gonna take me to the top.
Never gonna happen, buddy.
- It's already happening, so...
- Dream on.
Lucas said you work for a doctor.
- Yeah, I do.
- He's, like, a
- fancy doctor.
- Ooh, you must have stories.
Well, yeah, but I-I can't actually say.
Uh... yeah, you can.
- Please do.
- What?
Come on.
- Come on.
- Oh, come on.
- Oh, come on.
Yes, you can.
- N-No...
- Yes.
- No.
- Come on, please.
- Go, go, go.
Come on.
Just so you know, Eve, we have a rule:
What happens in the kingdom of the peons stays in the kingdom of the peons.
Mm-hmm.
- Cone of silence.
- Promise?
Yes.
Absolutely.
- Swear.
- Totally.
Go.
Okay.
Okay.
Yes!
So... okay, last week... a celebrity called.
And let's just say, she's had a really hard time with her weight.
- Who was it?
- I can't say.
Oh...
Just nod if it was a Kardashian.
No.
It's, it's not a Kardashian.
Okay, go ahead, dish on.
So, she had just gotten back from Europe, where she had some sort of weight-loss procedure, and it just is not going well for her.
And she couldn't go to a hospital, because she knew that an orderly would text TMZ in, like, a hot minute, and also... she was really embarrassed.
This is so much more interesting than picking up dry cleaning.
Uh, so I finally gained her trust and to get her to tell me what's going on over the phone.
I send Rush there, and he pulls out a three-foot tapeworm out of her butt by rolling it around a pencil.
What?
No... way!
Yeah, that's true story.
That's totally awesome.
True story.
- Ew...
- I'm shocked.
That's, uh...
I was just buying some stinky green bud when you called.
I rolled you...
Thanks.
I need that.
Yo... homey.
Put that thing down.
What the what, dude?
- This is your guy?
- Yeah.
This is my guy.
Right.
You're gonna take him to a Level One trauma center.
Single knife wound to the right chest... collapsed right lung.
Anyone asks any questions, you found him like this on Olympic and Vermont.
- Okay?
- Easy peasy, brother.
Then I'm out.
No.
Then it's just you and me.
We should get you to a hospital.
Shut up and drive.
My last relationship was...
- a disaster.
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.
Mine, too.
- Ooh.
Bring it.
Tell me.
- Uh... well, my ex-girlfriend threw her iPhone at me so many times, she had a standing appointment at the Genius Bar, so...
Yikes.
So, are you still pissed your boss made you come out with me?
♪Ooh, baby, baby ♪
Nobody makes me do anything.
♪Ooh, baby, baby ♪
♪B-B-B-Baby ♪
♪Push it real good ♪
♪Real good ♪
♪Ah, push it ♪
♪Push it real good ♪
♪Ah, push it ♪
Do you want to get out of here?
- ♪Yo!
♪
- Sure.
Oh, shit.
You want to tell me where we're going?
Man... you ask a lot of questions.
Shit.
Shit.
- Here.
- Whoa.
What the hell are you doing?
!
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
I'm just... was gonna take a trip to the neighborhood pharmacy.
I'm trying to help here, okay?
It's Vicodin... for the pain.
Come on, take it.
You think I don't know what you're doing?
No way.
All right.
All right.
Don't say I didn't offer.
My dad's gonna kill me.
You two don't get along?
No.
Seems like... ever since I showed up...
I've been a little less than he was hoping for.
I know the feeling.
Bullshit.
You're a doctor.
And your point is?
If I were a doctor, my dad would be the happiest son of a bitch in the world.
You'd think so, wouldn't you?
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm great.
Yeah.
Um... s-sorry, sorry.
Hang on.
Sorry.
I'm sorry, I don't...
I-I think that I'm not ready.
I thought that I was, but maybe I'm... not, and I'm sorry.
The ex?
Uh, I guess.
Or me.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
I'm sure.
- Okay.
Okay, then.
- Okay.
Okay.
What, do you want to stay anyway?
It's late.
I'm... no, I'm...
I think I'm just...
I'm gonna go.
Yeah, I'll just go.
Can I see you again?
Yeah.
I would, I would like that.
Me, too.
Thank you.
For being cool.
No problem.
You sure we're not lost?
No, this is it.
Stop here.
Here?
Yeah.
This is where you're going?
Yeah.
All right.
Look.
I know I make a living out of not giving a shit, but seeing as you're not a paying customer, I got to say
I...
I'm worried about you, man.
It's gonna be okay, Doc.
Can you help me get inside?
Uh, okay.
Carter?
Mom.
Oh, my God!
What happened?
!
Yeah.
We got to get that leg elevated.
Who are you?
I'm a doctor.
Who is it?
Let's get you over here.
What the hell are you doing here?
Nowhere else to go.
How did that happen?
- They sent a bounty hunter after me.
- Why?
That's what you're gonna ask me, Dad?
While I'm sitting here bleeding?
What did you do?
What the hell did you do?
What does it matter?
Sir, your son needs help.
My son is an idiot!
And you need to leave now.
Mike!
This is how it works, Donna.
As long as he keeps up this kind of behavior,
- he cannot be in this house.
- We can't move him now.
I'll leave in the morning, I promise.
- Now.
Calling the police.
- What are you doing?
- No, Dad, please don't!
- Hey, hey!
Take it easy.
Take it easy!
Take...
He's lost too much blood.
- I'll call 911!
- Oh, no.
Don't bother.
He'll be dead before the ambulance gets here.
His pulse is fading.
What's your blood type?
Uh, uh, B-positive.
What's yours?
O, I think.
Yeah?
Sit down.
Why?
Sit down!
Okay, okay.
What are we doing?
I'm gonna do a direct transfusion, okay?
He's gonna give you his blood.
All right.
Okay, give me your wrist.
All right.
All right.
I'm sorry.
I'm a screwup.
I...
I know.
It doesn't matter.
I'll do better, Dad.
I promise.
Oh... shut up.
I promise.
It's fine.
It's all fine.
Oh, my God.
Is he dead?
No.
No, your-your heart's acting like a pump.
It's starting to work.
Is he gonna make it?
Please.
Don't let him die.
He's gonna be okay.
Yeah?
Hey.
Where are you?
Sorry, man.
I-I got busy.
Well, hurry your ass up.
I'm four bourbons in.
Five in.
All right.
I'll be there in, like, 20 minutes, okay?
Dude, I'm not going anywhere.
Actually... you know what?
I-I just got to make one more stop.
Okay?
I-I'll be there as soon as I can.
All right.
I'm here.
Hey.
My dad here?
No.
But come in, by all means.
All right.
So, uh, where is he?
He's with Lily at the country club.
The father-daughter dance.
Oh, right.
What are you doing here?
Actually, I, uh...
I dropped by to thank him.
You okay?
Everything all right?
Warren found my Adderall.
He threw a shit fit.
A real classic.
Turns out I'm a bad mother now, too.
You want a drink?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I could use one, actually.
Um... pardon me for saying this, Corrine, but... you are obviously addicted to prescription meds.
So he's not entirely off-base.
You're defending him?
Well, I...
Hold on.
You know, nobody knows better than I do what an asshole my father can be, so remember who you're talking to here, all right?
But, you know, he-he takes care of you and Lily and, you know, when I needed him, he... he was there for me.
So, uh, you know, like you said, he's not all bad.
I helped you out, Will.
Me.
What?
Warren wasn't going to do it.
He wanted to let you twist in the wind.
Right.
Of course.
But I wouldn't let him.
I fought with him all night long after you left just to get him to make that call.
And why would you do that?
Because Warren Rush shouldn't get his way every time, should he?
Certainly not.
We should just...
I'm sorry about dinner, man.
I was pissed.
Well, for the first two drinks.
And then I got depressed.
Then I started to think it's kind of funny.
You know, me sitting here all alone as people came and went.
So...
I went to In-N-Out.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
Got a Double-Double...
- Animal Style.
- Animal Style?
So, where were you?
Oh, you know, just putting in some family time.
Hope you thanked your dad for me.
I have had the craziest, most stressful day in the history of ever.
Yeah?
I can only imagine.
When you left, Laurel and I just...
I mean, we really got into it.
And I'm not talking about a blowout.
I'm talking Super Bowl of blowouts.
Uh-oh.
I don't think I'm going home tonight.
I don't think I'll go home tomorrow, either.
It's just bananas.
Seriously.
Oh!
"Out of almond milk.
Stop at Whole Foods on your way home."
See?
This is what I'm talking about!
You see?
This is...
- She wants to control my life.
- Hey.
And now I have to go run errands for her?
Hell to the no.
No!
That text just means she's sorry.
She's just, you know... she's too proud to actually say it.
Screw her.
Alex?
This shit will pass.
I know that.
It's just...
- you know.
- I know.
You don't know how good you got it.
Go on.
Go home to your family.
Okay.
- I'll go home.
- Yeah.
In a cab.
Yeah.
I'm not stopping to get that almond milk.
Uh-uh.
No, no.
No way.
Stay strong, brother.
During your party?
I'm prepared to spend my life savings on this opportunity.
Congratulations, partner.
Antonio?
Raquel.
I'm a sex addict.
I had been doing so well, until you.
Are you breaking up with me?
Keisha Greene, you're under arrest for tax evasion.
You got a name, man?
Sean...
Clark.
My lawyer.
Maybe I should have given you another chance.
We'd probably be married by now.
This is my little brother Terrance.
What the hell are you doing here?
I did time for your ass and this is how you treat me?
I want to move to New York with you.
Come here.
Admit, once and for all,
Reggie, that you are gay.
I'm a prince.
Will you be my fourth and final wife?
Charles, by the way.
Raquel.
I love you.
I've gone back with my ex girlfriend.
Padma, this is Raquel.
Keisha.
It's okay.
It's over.
Malcolm.
I really tried to make this work.
Well, I think, we both know why you couldn't get there.
I love you.
I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again.
Charles, wait.
Raquel?
Charles.
Raquel?
I love you.
Keisha, please tell me you're coming out of there some time soon.
Now, Malcolm, you know you can't rush fabulous.
Oh, trust me.
I've learned.
You gonna come help a sister out, and zip me into my dress?
I will try.
I will definitely try, but you know I can't make any promises.
Save that for later.
We don't want to be late.
Man, it feels good to be back home, huh?
Yes, it does.
But don't worry.
I have the jet on standby, which means we could be out of here right after the wedding tomorrow.
Wherever you want to go.
Well, I'm good anywhere as long as there's hot tables, and cold drinks, and you.
I got to be honest, for a second,
I didn't think we were gonna make it.
But I was wrong.
Here we are.
Okay, I'm almost ready.
Are you done yet?
Almost.
Just a sec.
Finally.
Thought you got cold feet.
Cute.
Too bad it's a waste on me.
I know.
I hate going dateless to a wedding.
It's like the worst.
I don't know.
I kind of love it.
I finally ditched the break up blues, and Raquel, party of one, is ready to get her life back.
I do some of my best work at weddings.
Where don't you do your best work?
True.
Dating two brothers at once took me out of commission for a while.
Got to get my groove back.
Well, I'm sure you'll have two more on the hook before we even hit the lobby.
Three.
I'll still have time to play wingman to y'alls narrow behinds.
Just remember, if I give the signal, fall back ten feet stat.
Whatever.
Go ahead.
I don't mind.
I mind.
Okay?
I mind.
My brother's been blowing up my cell phone all day long, I just don't want him ruining our evening.
No, no, no, no, no.
But our friends are waiting.
Let them wait.
We did say seven, right?
They're probably still just getting ready.
And by getting ready, I mean getting busy.
- And by getting busy, I mean...
- Yeah.
We know what you mean, Omar.
Oh, you're just going through a little post-Reggie dry spell.
It's not gonna last forever.
Two weeks is a dry spell.
You're looking at the Sahara.
So you let Reggie move to New York without you.
Bravo.
Couldn't wait for him to leave.
Sorry we're late, y'all.
We were getting dressed.
It was taking Malcolm a little longer than usual.
Hey, I missed you guys.
Hi.
Missed you too.
Omar.
Cruella.
Long time, no talk.
Yeah.
Too long.
I'm glad you're back.
Thank you.
Miss Lancaster, Miss Goldberg, Miss Greene, the bride has asked to see you.
She says it's urgent.
Thank God, you're here.
I don't know if I can do this.
Marrying a prince?
Okay, truth.
Am I crazy?
Of course not.
- Maybe...
- Oh, yes.
What?
She asked.
I'm supposed to marry Kasim tomorrow, and I want to, I think.
I mean, he's providing a great life for me and Nicole, but is it worth it?
What am I doing?
Let me amend my previous statement.
He's a filthy rich prince, who showers you with gifts, who lives halfway around the world.
Is there a question?
I'm pretty sure the answer's yes.
Well, I don't really get the whole fourth wife thing, but I hate sharing my food, so, not the best judge.
Okay.
Sure, it's unconventional, but is marrying Kasim the right thing for you?
I think so.
Then there's your answer.
We're always here for you.
You got this.
What size are these?
Always girl, we got you.
Oh, thank you, ladies.
So Raquel, now that I'm back,
I want all the juicy details.
Ooh, it's a long story.
No, it's a crazy story.
Raquel laid her heart on the line and then...
And Charles stomped on it and chose Padma.
I know this part.
I want to know the real T.
Okay.
So I got back with Antonio for a minute but then
- I realized he wasn't ready...
- Keisha.
You know what?
There's not enough time, or enough Martinis.
So I'm moving on.
And let's just say a lot has changed since you went on vacation.
Well, it wasn't all party time.
We did some business too.
As much fun as Malcolm and I had visiting Franks Jewels in Belgium, and Dubai, and Monte Carlo, I miss Atlanta.
I'm ready to come home.
So why don't you?
It's not just up to me.
Malcolm loves to travel.
What would I look like talking about I'm ready to 'settle down'.
Wait.
You?
Settle down?
Yeah, no.
We don't see that.
You know what?
Okay, I'm going up to bed.
No.
Big day tomorrow.
But first, a big night.
Yes.
Malcolm promised me a bath.
All right, well, I think
I'm going to hang out here.
Do you want me to stay?
No, you guys go ahead.
Maybe I'll take a bath in this.
As long as you don't take a bath in one of those hotel fountains.
Trust me.
Not as fun as it sounds.
Bye.
Can you hold that please?
Thank you so much.
Hang on.
Hang on.
Whoa.
Okay.
Going to the balcony party.
Sor... sorry.
You okay?
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Sir, can you press 15 please?
Oh, that's right.
Hold on a second.
I have keys here somewhere.
Oh, sorry.
Sorry.
Oh, I'm on 15 too.
Everybody else is on 15, yeah?
Party.
Whose hand is this?
I found it on my ass.
Hey gorgeous, are you guys up for some after hours?
Oh, me?
No.
No.
Thank you though.
Oh, come on.
She's fine, bro.
Yeah, she is fine, but she could be finer if she'd come to the party.
Listen.
No, no, no.
What she's saying is, is that my girlfriend and I, we haven't seen each other in a few weeks, and we're looking forward to some alone time.
Right baby?
Yes.
Yes, we are.
You guys are missing out.
I doubt it.
Wow.
Ooh, wow.
Thanks for the save.
Alec Hansen, at your service.
Raquel Lancaster.
Nice to meet you.
So I take it you're not part of this whole little party here?
Oh, no, no, no.
Not that particular party.
I'm here for a wedding tomorrow.
Oh, nice.
I love weddings.
Come on.
Since when do guys like weddings?
What's not to like?
Free food, free drinks, electric slide, beautiful women.
Be careful, I might ask you to be my date.
I would totally invite myself if I didn't have to be on a plane right after my scout tomorrow.
Scout?
Yeah, I'm a pro basketball scout.
You live in L.A.
No, no.
I live on the road, especially this time of the year, but I'm in this area a lot.
Do you have a card?
No, not on me, but I own a boutique here in Atlanta called Indulgence.
Nice.
It's listed.
Okay.
I'll be sure to look it up.
This is me.
Right, well, pleasure meeting you, Raquel.
The pleasure was all mine.
Have a lovely evening.
You as well.
Oh, and Raquel?
Yeah.
I would have definitely gone to that wedding with you.
Some other time then.
Some other time.
So, how much does this suck?
Flying solo at a royal wedding.
I wouldn't know.
I'm here to watch my client perform, and collect my fee.
I mean, look at us.
I mean, we're not Bar Rafaeli hot, but we're pretty freaking hot, right?
Right?
And she's still talking.
I don't know what your deal is, but, you know what?
Hey, I'll admit it:
I totally brought this on myself.
I couldn't be with a guy that I knew wasn't right for me.
You know what I mean?
Oh, not even a little.
I mean, can you imagine being with a guy, whose family actually hated you so much that they staged a fake intervention to get rid of you?
I'm beginning to imagine right now.
Hey.
It worked.
I mean, it was not the way they thought it would, but, you know what?
Hey, I knew Reggie wasn't gay.
I knew.
Hello.
But deep down inside I knew also, he wasn't "the one."
You know, the one.
And I just couldn't just up and leave to New York, and give up my entire life to be with him.
So, here we are.
Here we are.
At a royal wedding.
Alone.
Oh, God.
I'm Pippa.
Minus the tight ass, of course.
And I'm leaving.
Excuse me.
I'll get it.
I'll get it.
Bartender?
No, no, no.
Can I get another one?
Jesus.
Please get away.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
You know what?
I've got a napkin in my purse.
No, no, no.
I'm fine.
Right here.
Right here.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh, ooh, you okay?
Gravity's a bitch, huh?
Holy stilettos, Batman.
That's Felicia Price in the wicked flesh.
Networking moment.
You should go talk to her.
Felicia?
The Felicia Price?
Oh, my God.
Was I that wasted last night?
I didn't recognize the most ruthless music manager in the industry?
I spilled wine on her.
In that case, you should hide behind this program.
Right.
I read once on iamjasonlee, she once choked out
Little Wayne for skipping his studio time.
She is pure evil, and I adore her.
I prefer evil personified.
It's a longer headline.
Oh, my God.
Miss Price, I'm a huge fan.
Have you met April Goldberg?
Promoter extraordinaire?
- She signed...
- Mac Miller.
I've heard of you.
Right.
Yes.
Wait, you've heard of me?
Well, you're nothing like what I expected, but, yes.
Thanks, it was really nice to meet you ma'am.
How's your finger?
Did you just "ma'am" me?
No.
No.
That's what I said.
Terrance?
Are you okay?
What are you doing here, man?
You can't call me back?
Because I didn't want to talk to you, T.
I wanted you to talk to pops, Malcolm.
He's been acting strange all day.
Okay.
I'll call him as soon as we're done.
You can't, Malcolm.
He had a heart attack.
Pops is dead.
Your place is gonna look so good.
I cannot wait till it's done.
Me too.
I don't know, I'm still playing with the colors though.
I can't seem to find the perfect shade that says Raquel reboot.
So I was thinking about getting this chair that I saw at the design store.
Look at this.
Speaking of rebooting.
Have you checked your browser history lately?
Uh, yeah.
You want to see this.
Whoa.
Wait a second.
Was Antonio watching porn on my computer?
I don't think it's a big deal,
I mean, everyone watches... wow.
Now that is impressive.
Her legs are like... how many of those can she fit in there?
April.
A sex addict watching porn is different than the rest of us.
Jeez.
I knew the guy was backsliding.
But I didn't think he was spiraling.
You want to talk about spiraling, you got to check this out.
This is like Cirque Du Soleil with batteries.
Sorry.
Wow.
Just when you think you got a guy out of your head, this.
This is so not okay.
Girl, you are not even gonna believe.
Uh, my key didn't work.
Oh, yeah, right.
I changed the locks.
After that whole Veronica stalker situation,
I needed to play it safe.
You couldn't heads up somebody?
Well, I didn't think "I changed the locks,"
was an appropriate response to "Alana's bananas.
Wish you were here."
And you're redecorating.
Okay, I'm sensing a theme here.
I'd say it was more like repairing.
Keisha, the house was trashed, don't you remember?
The dining room table was like everywhere.
The chairs were broken.
And I sent you a check.
I know.
I got it.
Thank you.
Well, what's up with you two?
April looks guilty.
Nothing.
Just, um, Antonio left me a couple of reminders of him that I did not need.
Yeah, Keisha, you got to see this.
April.
Ignore her.
Already done.
I came by to grab something to wear to the funeral.
My suitcase has nothing but shimmer.
How are you guys?
Well, you know Malcolm.
He's doing the most.
Planning the funeral, handling statements to the press.
He says he's fine, but he just lost his father.
It's tough.
Of course.
Well, please, send him our love and our regards.
Yeah.
Please do.
Hello?
Yeah, this is April.
She does?
With me?
Do you know what this is regarding?
Because you know what,
I could just send her a check.
Okay.
Thanks.
Who was that?
That was Felicia Price's office.
She wants to see me tomorrow.
That's great.
Isn't it?
I have no idea.
Oh, hi.
We need to lock Ravon up in 360 before Live Nation does.
Shankman already has eye on him for a movie, which I'm scheduled to produce, of course.
She's two years away from having her own vegan cosmetic line.
Get on it.
You.
Good to see you, Felicia.
Please, let me apologize again for the finger.
Oh, stop, stop, stop.
The finger thing made it easier for me to get my Valium script refilled, and clearly you can't afford the dress.
This is about business.
Have a seat.
Okay.
Show me what you've got.
I need to see even a sliver of the Ariel Goldstein who signed Mac Miller.
Actually, it's April.
It's not.
Check a calendar.
If you could squeeze a bit of magic out of that, then there could be a place for you here at price management.
Really?
There's an artist I've got my eye on, an up-and-comer.
His name is Epoch, End right now he's being repped by Hank Hartley.
Oh, right, right, right.
I've heard great things about Hank.
Oh, yeah.
Me too.
You need to steal his client.
Wait.
- I need...
- Bring be Epoch, and perhaps we can have a more substantive conversation.
But, how do...
Felicia?
Excuse me.
Were you even going to ask me if
I wanted to come work for you?
Why?
Who wouldn't?
Thank you.
Is there anything I can do?
No.
No, this is...
The seating chart is wrong.
The order of speakers is wrong.
I mean, just how inept are these people?
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to...
It's just a lot to deal with, you know?
Yeah.
It's okay.
I get it.
Terrance.
He's the one who really should be helping me with all of this.
And where is he?
Why don't you call him?
Because I shouldn't have to, Keisha.
Just when he needs something, he's on me all damn day long, and now that I need him... he's just a ghost.

Hey, yeah, what's up?
Hey, what's up?
All right, thanks, man.
Your chick trying to take you to court for $10,000 a month for child support, man.
You pick the crazy one, man.
I don't mind the child support, but she can't have full custody.
I want my time with the girls.
You can have custody of my kids if you want.
Thanks, man, but I think
I'll stick to the ones I made.
Come on, man.
Let's hit it.
Let's hit it, man.
What's up?
Y'all ready?
Ugh.
I need a break from sadness, and funerals, and blah.
Somebody buy me a drink and amuse me.
Hey, Keisha.
You guys all set for tomorrow?
You need me to bring anything?
No.
We're good.
You moved my sofa.
Damn.
Have I been gone that long?
Omar, come help me move this.
Stop.
Just stop.
Leave the sofa where it is.
Fine.
I just thought...
You thought wrong.
A lot of things have changed around here since you left.
I've put things where I want them.
You can't just waltz in here like... you know what?
Never mind.
No.
No.
Like what?
You and I both have a lot of things going on right now.
I don't want to get into this.
Why not?
You've obviously been holding onto something ever since I've gotten back.
So, let's have it.
This may come as a shock to you, but everybody does not revolve around planet Keisha.
You never walk in a room and ask how anybody else is doing.
Oh, really?
Really.
When Malcolm called, you up and disappeared for three months.
You barely checked in.
And now that you're back, you just think that time has stood still?
That the sofa is where you left it, and everything is just gonna pick right back up again?
That's not how it works, Keisha.
Life goes on.
Even if you're not here to see it.
Yes, it does.
And since you think I'm so good at disappearing...
Oh... my...
God.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Miss Price...
Miss Price, thank you for this opportunity, but, after careful consideration,
I can not accept the terms of your offer.
It's outside of my moral comfort... no.
You know what?
Actually,
I don't even want to work at Price Management.
Because you know why?
I want to be able to look at myself in the mirror.
All right.
It's that girl I was telling you about.
Ugh.
I know, right?
Hank is going to have a fit when he finds out though.
I owe him after he tried to screw me on that commercial deal.
Oh, don't worry.
She'll never be able to pull it off.
I can't wait to hear the sob story she comes back with.
I'm sure it will be Epoch.
You know he was still late?
I'm gonna go say something to him.
Yeah, but be cool.
You were late.
All right?
Now, I specifically told you 10 o'clock, but you... you were still late.
Come on, Malcolm.
Let's be honest.
You couldn't care less whether or not the ex-con brother is there.
So, you guys hungry?
I'm out.
No, you're not.
Come here for a second.
What, Malcolm?
Today is not about you.
Okay?
Now I need for you to lose the attitude and just get it together, man.
Think you can do that for pops?
For me?
For you?
Dude, please.
Just go, T. Just go.
Be the hothead just like always.
You don't know what I am.
Pops knew.
Pops knew?
Pops knew, huh?
Maybe that's why he chose me to run the company.
You ever think about that?
What the hell are y'all looking at?
I'm sorry.
We just wanted to make sure everything...
This is family business.
It has nothing to do with you.
Either of you.
I don't usually bring food to people who yell at me, but I'm guessing you haven't eaten in a while.
Thanks.
I'm sorry to...
Hey.
Don't come out here talking about you know what I'm going through.
You're right, I don't.
But I know what it's like to have a family who doesn't get you.
Who tries to turn you into whatever they want you to be.
I've spent years living a life that way.
You are nothing like me.
Maybe not.
But the resentment, the need to make people pay for doubting you, I get that.
You know what's worse than letting your family make choices for you?
Letting anger do it.
It only winds up hurting you more than anyone else.
Why do you care?
I just can't stand to see two people who love each other implode.
Then you better look away.
You're welcome.
Today was a beautiful day.
Your father would have loved it.
How are you?
I honestly don't know.
This is the first chance
I've had to breathe.
I know.
But you can breathe now.
I'm done with traveling for a while.
Let's just stay in this suite, relax, and just figure out what's next.
I really want to make sure that everything is stable with the company, and I just feel like people need to see my face around here.
I really hope that doesn't disappointment you.
No.
Not at all.
I'm kind of done with traveling too.
I miss my life here, my friends...
I'm ready to come home.
Why didn't you say something?
I didn't want you to think
I was tying you down.
Losing my edge.
You know I was thinking the same thing.
Yeah.
What's happening to us?
Are we settling down already?
Are we the Huxtables?
Oh, good God, I hope not.
Oh, no, no, no.
Hi.
The new colors look hot.
If you're gonna throw that at me,
I should probably put the drop cloths back on.
No protection required.
Here.
I know I'm a bit late, but, it's a breakup survival kit.
Everything a single lady needs.
Well, almost.
You still have those batteries in your night stand, right?
How dare you?
Oh, I see, I know you better than you think.
Listen, I didn't like hearing what you had to say the other day, but you were right.
I just floated off in my happy bubble with Malcolm, and I wasn't here for you, and I'm sorry.
I didn't mean for it to come out that way.
I just...
I kind of lost it.
Yeah, you did.
But it's okay.
I know I can be a little self-absorbed.
But it doesn't mean that you can't count on me.
I will always be ride or die for you, girl.
I know.
Okay.
Let's open it up.
Hi.
I'm sorry.
Do we...
No.
We don't have an appointment.
Hi, I'm April Goldberg and I just need five minutes of your time.
You know Felicia Price, right?
Lady MacBitch.
Sure.
Whose life is she trying to ruin now?
Yours.
She wants Epoch, and she's going to steal him from you.
What?
How do you know that?
She sent me to do it.
Why are you telling me?
Because,
I have a better idea.
Here's the thing.
Bottom line, you can't beat Felicia.
If she wants Epoch, she's gonna get him.
So your best option is to share Epoch with me, off the record of course.
And why would I do that?
Well, with Felicia's reputation and the firm's resources I can double your client's earnings.
So, you share Epoch with me, you lose absolutely nothing.
It's a win-win.
Or you can go up against Felicia, and see how that works out for you.
It's done.
Epoch is officially a client of Price Management.
Take that to business affairs.
They're on the second floor.
Oh, and while you're down there, talk to them about your deal.
Wait, my deal?
Does this this mean I'm hired?
Hopefully it means you're gonna buy a new wardrobe.
With regards to Franks Jewels, LLC and its holdings,
I ask that the company shares be divided equally between my two sons,
Malcolm Franks Junior and Terrance Franks.
I want Terrance to take his rightful place in the company by his brother's side.
What?
No, that can't be right.
Malcolm.
I need to see that will.
There's no way my father wrote that.
Just because you can't respect me, it doesn't mean that pops didn't.
I need to see the will.
Sorry to interrupt, ladies and gentlemen, but we have an urgent matter that couldn't wait.
My client and I are here to contest the last will and testament of Mr. Malcolm Franks Senior.
Who the hell are you?
His wife.
April, congratulations on your new job, and showing Felicia that you could swim with the sharks.
Here's to hoping I don't become chum.
And to Raquel, for surviving two breakups, and still looking fabulous, and for going in on Keisha the way I always wanted to.
Salud.
Salud.
Eve.
Hi.
Yeah, sure.
How are you?
Yeah, I understand.
Thanks.
Honey, are you okay?
No.
Eve just broke up with me.
I'm gonna need you to clarify that.
She's pulling her investment in Indulgence.
Apparently she got some big marketing contract with H.S.N.
and our relationship is a conflict of interest.
So what?
So that's it?
She's just out?
Damn, Eve.
Oh, my gosh.
I've got about six months to find an investor.
I put my entire savings into this place.
Wow.
You really are as gorgeous as I remember.
Thank you.
So would you like a drink, or should we go straight to dinner?
No.
I would love a drink.
I definitely need one.
Okay, have a seat.
What can I get you?
I would love a vodka tonic.
Vodka tonic coming right up.
Tough day at the office?
You have no idea.
Actually, you probably do.
I mean, we all have them, right?
Technically, I don't have an office, but I do have my bad days, for sure.
I hate seeing the pressure these kids are under, you know?
In fact, this kid in Ohio almost lost a tryout because of you.
Because of me?
Mm-hmm.
So the day after we meet,
I'm in Ohio to watch supposed next LeBron James play, right?
But, I can barely focus, because all I can think about is being trapped in an elevator with you.
Oh, okay.
So I ruined the chances for the next LeBron James.
Not quite.
No, I mean this guy definitely owes you a basket of muffins or something, because I was definitely in a much better mood thanks to you.
Really?
Well, now I'm in a really good mood thanks to you.
I'd like to put you in a better mood.
Is that so?
How's that?
Oh, I'm, definitely in a better mood.
So what's after better?
I could think of a few things.
You know, making out like this on the couch reminds me of high school.
Scared your parents might come in and catch us?
Don't worry.
We're grown ups, we won't get into any trouble.
I'm sorry, what did you say?
I said we're not gonna get in trouble.
Promise.
I'm sorry.
I can't do this, Alec.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I mean, nothing with you, obviously.
Hello, you are perfect.
Look, I know this would be a lot of fun, and that it would make me feel a lot better, but, you know, just for one night, because, after that, then it's
just gonna be a month of,
"when am I gonna see him again?"
And do I even want to see him again?
And should I have slept with this guy on the first date?
And why even mess with a guy who
"doesn't live in my same city?"
I've got to make some changes.
Three months ago, I was running after this guy, literally, through a marathon, in the opposite direction of the runners, begging for him to take me back.
Wow.
Yes, wow, exactly.
I mean, if I am gonna be an adult, I need to start acting like one, and, as much as
I would love the sexy diversion from all the troubles in my life right now, and that bomb that just dropped on my business,
I know that,
I just know that this is just gonna get me in more trouble.
So this isn't happening.
I'm sorry.
Me too.
I'm gonna go, Alec.
Is it okay if I hold onto your number?
Hell, yeah.
Okay.
Good.
Good.
You know, just in case I change my mind.
Right.
Okay, bye.
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
During your party?
I'm prepared to spend my life savings on this opportunity.
Congratulations, partner.
Antonio?
Raquel.
I'm a sex addict.
I had been doing so well, until you.
Are you breaking up with me?
Keisha Greene, you're under arrest for tax evasion.
You got a name, man?
Sean...
Clark.
My lawyer.
Maybe I should have given you another chance.
We'd probably be married by now.
This is my little brother Terrance.
What the hell are you doing here?
I did time for your ass and this is how you treat me?
I want to move to New York with you.
Come here.
Admit, once and for all,
Reggie, that you are gay.
I'm a prince.
Will you be my fourth and final wife?
Charles, by the way.
Raquel.
I love you.
I've gone back with my ex girlfriend.
Padma, this is Raquel.
Keisha.
[Screaming]
It's okay.
It's over.
Malcolm.
I really tried to make this work.
Well, I think, we both know why you couldn't get there.
I love you.
I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again.
Charles, wait.
Raquel?
Charles.
Raquel?
I love you.

Now, Malcolm, you know you can't rush fabulous.
Oh, trust me.
I've learned.
Mm-hmm.
You gonna come help a sister out, and zip me into my dress?
I will try.
I will definitely try, but you know I can't make any promises.
Ooh.
Save that for later.
We don't want to be late.
[Kissing]
Man, it feels good to be back home, huh?
Yes, it does.
But don't worry.
I have the jet on standby, which means we could be out of here right after the wedding tomorrow.
Wherever you want to go.
Well, I'm good anywhere as long as there's hot tables, and cold drinks, and you.
I got to be honest, for a second,
I didn't think we were gonna make it.
But I was wrong.
Here we are.
Okay, I'm almost ready.
Are you done yet?
Almost.
[Knocking]
Just a sec.
Finally.
Thought you got cold feet.
Cute.
Too bad it's a waste on me.
I know.
I hate going dateless to a wedding.
It's like the worst.
I don't know.
I kind of love it.
I finally ditched the break up blues, and Raquel, party of one, is ready to get her life back.
I do some of my best work at weddings.
Where don't you do your best work?
True.
Dating two brothers at once took me out of commission for a while.
Got to get my groove back.
Well, I'm sure you'll have two more on the hook before we even hit the lobby.
Three.
I'll still have time to play wingman to y'alls narrow behinds.
Just remember, if I give the signal, fall back ten feet stat.
Mm-hmm.
Whatever.
[Phone vibrating]
Go ahead.
I don't mind.
I mind.
Okay?
I mind.
My brother's been blowing up my cell phone all day long, I just don't want him ruining our evening.
Nuh-uh.
No, no, no, no, no.
But our friends are waiting.
Let them wait.
[Giggles]
We did say seven, right?
They're probably still just getting ready.
And by getting ready, I mean getting busy.
- And by getting busy, I mean...
- Yeah.
We know what you mean, Omar.
Oh, you're just going through a little post-Reggie dry spell.
It's not gonna last forever.
Two weeks is a dry spell.
You're looking at the Sahara.
So you let Reggie move to New York without you.
Bravo.
Couldn't wait for him to leave.
Sorry we're late, y'all.
We were getting dressed.
It was taking Malcolm a little longer than usual.
Hey, I missed you guys.
Hi.
Missed you too.
Omar.
Cruella.
[Laughing]
Long time, no talk.
Yeah.
Too long.
I'm glad you're back.
Thank you.
Miss Lancaster, Miss Goldberg, Miss Greene, the bride has asked to see you.
She says it's urgent.
Thank God, you're here.
I don't know if I can do this.
Marrying a prince?
Okay, truth.
Am I crazy?
Of course not.
- Maybe...
- Oh, yes.
What?
She asked.
I'm supposed to marry Kasim tomorrow, and I want to, I think.
I mean, he's providing a great life for me and Nicole, but is it worth it?
What am I doing?
Let me amend my previous statement.
He's a filthy rich prince, who showers you with gifts, who lives halfway around the world.
Is there a question?
I'm pretty sure the answer's yes.
Well, I don't really get the whole fourth wife thing, but I hate sharing my food, so, not the best judge.
Okay.
Sure, it's unconventional, but is marrying Kasim the right thing for you?
I think so.
Then there's your answer.
We're always here for you.
You got this.
What size are these?
Always girl, we got you.
Oh, thank you, ladies.
[Laughter]
So Raquel, now that I'm back,
I want all the juicy details.
Ooh, it's a long story.
No, it's a crazy story.
Raquel laid her heart on the line and then...
And Charles stomped on it and chose Padma.
I know this part.
I want to know the real T.
Okay.
So I got back with Antonio for a minute but then
- I realized he wasn't ready...
- Keisha.
You know what?
There's not enough time, or enough Martinis.
So I'm moving on.
And let's just say a lot has changed since you went on vacation.
Well, it wasn't all party time.
We did some business too.
As much fun as Malcolm and I had visiting Franks Jewels in Belgium, and Dubai, and Monte Carlo, I miss Atlanta.
I'm ready to come home.
So why don't you?
It's not just up to me.
Malcolm loves to travel.
What would I look like talking about I'm ready to 'settle down'.
[Laughter]
Wait.
You?
Settle down?
Yeah, no.
We don't see that.
You know what?
Okay, I'm going up to bed.
No.
Big day tomorrow.
But first, a big night.
Yes.
Malcolm promised me a bath.
[Both] Ooh.
All right, well, I think
I'm going to hang out here.
Do you want me to stay?
No, you guys go ahead.
Maybe I'll take a bath in this.
As long as you don't take a bath in one of those hotel fountains.
Trust me.
Not as fun as it sounds.
Bye.
Can you hold that please?
Oh.
Thank you so much.
[Clamoring]
Hang on.
Hang on.
Whoa.
Okay.
Going to the balcony party.
Sor... sorry.
You okay?
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Sir, can you press 15 please?
Oh, that's right.
Hold on a second.
I have keys here somewhere.
Oh, sorry.
Sorry.
Oh, I'm on 15 too.
Everybody else is on 15, yeah?
Party.
Whose hand is this?
I found it on my ass.
Hey gorgeous, are you guys up for some after hours?
Oh, me?
No.
No.
Thank you though.
Oh, come on.
She's fine, bro.
[All] Oh.
Yeah, she is fine, but she could be finer if she'd come to the party.
Listen.
No, no, no.
What she's saying is, is that my girlfriend and I, we haven't seen each other in a few weeks, and we're looking forward to some alone time.
Right baby?
Yes.
Yes, we are.
You guys are missing out.
I doubt it.
Wow.
Ooh, wow.
Thanks for the save.
Alec Hansen, at your service.
Raquel Lancaster.
Nice to meet you.
So I take it you're not part of this whole little party here?
Oh, no, no, no.
Not that particular party.
I'm here for a wedding tomorrow.
Oh, nice.
I love weddings.
Come on.
Since when do guys like weddings?
What's not to like?
Free food, free drinks, electric slide, beautiful women.
Be careful, I might ask you to be my date.
I would totally invite myself if I didn't have to be on a plane right after my scout tomorrow.
Scout?
Yeah, I'm a pro basketball scout.
Oh.
You live in L.A.
No, no.
I live on the road, especially this time of the year, but I'm in this area a lot.
Do you have a card?
No, not on me, but I own a boutique here in Atlanta called Indulgence.
Nice.
It's listed.
Okay.
I'll be sure to look it up.
This is me.
Right, well, pleasure meeting you, Raquel.
The pleasure was all mine.
Have a lovely evening.
You as well.
Oh, and Raquel?
Yeah.
I would have definitely gone to that wedding with you.
Some other time then.
Some other time.
So, how much does this suck?
Flying solo at a royal wedding.
I wouldn't know.
I'm here to watch my client perform, and collect my fee.
I mean, look at us.
I mean, we're not Bar Rafaeli hot, but we're pretty freaking hot, right?
Right?
And she's still talking.
I don't know what your deal is, but, you know what?
Hey, I'll admit it:
I totally brought this on myself.
I couldn't be with a guy that I knew wasn't right for me.
You know what I mean?
Oh, not even a little.
I mean, can you imagine being with a guy, whose family actually hated you so much that they staged a fake intervention to get rid of you?
I'm beginning to imagine right now.
Hey.
It worked.
I mean, it was not the way they thought it would, but, you know what?
Hey, I knew Reggie wasn't gay.
I knew.
Hello.
But deep down inside I knew also, he wasn't "the one."
You know, the one.
And I just couldn't just up and leave to New York, and give up my entire life to be with him.
So, here we are.
Here we are.
At a royal wedding.
Alone.
Oh, God.
I'm Pippa.
Minus the tight ass, of course.
And I'm leaving.
Excuse me.
I'll get it.
I'll get it.
Bartender?
No, no, no.
Can I get another one?
Jesus.
Please get away.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
You know what?
I've got a napkin in my purse.
No, no, no.
I'm fine.
Right here.
Right here.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Ahh.
Oh, ooh, you okay?
Gravity's a bitch, huh?
Holy stilettos, Batman.
That's Felicia Price in the wicked flesh.
Networking moment.
You should go talk to her.
Felicia?
The Felicia Price?
Oh, my God.
Was I that wasted last night?
I didn't recognize the most ruthless music manager in the industry?
I spilled wine on her.
In that case, you should hide behind this program.
Right.
I read once on iamjasonlee, she once choked out
Little Wayne for skipping his studio time.
She is pure evil, and I adore her.
I prefer evil personified.
It's a longer headline.
[Squeaking] Oh, my God.
Miss Price, I'm a huge fan.
Have you met April Goldberg?
Promoter extraordinaire?
- She signed...
- Mac Miller.
I've heard of you.
Right.
Yes.
Wait, you've heard of me?
Well, you're nothing like what I expected, but, yes.
Thanks, it was really nice to meet you ma'am.
How's your finger?
Did you just "ma'am" me?
No.
No.
[Laughs] That's what I said.
Terrance?
Are you okay?
What are you doing here, man?
You can't call me back?
Because I didn't want to talk to you, T.
I wanted you to talk to pops, Malcolm.
He's been acting strange all day.
Okay.
I'll call him as soon as we're done.
You can't, Malcolm.
He had a heart attack.
Pops is dead.
Your place is gonna look so good.
I cannot wait till it's done.
Me too.
I don't know, I'm still playing with the colors though.
I can't seem to find the perfect shade that says Raquel reboot.
So I was thinking about getting this chair that I saw at the design store.
Look at this.
Uh.
Speaking of rebooting.
Have you checked your browser history lately?
Hmm?
Uh, yeah.
You want to see this.
Whoa.
Wait a second.
Was Antonio watching porn on my computer?
I don't think it's a big deal,
I mean, everyone watches... wow.
Now that is impressive.
Her legs are like... how many of those can she fit in there?
April.
A sex addict watching porn is different than the rest of us.
Jeez.
I knew the guy was backsliding.
But I didn't think he was spiraling.
You want to talk about spiraling, you got to check this out.
This is like Cirque Du Soleil with batteries.
Sorry.
Wow.
Just when you think you got a guy out of your head, this.
This is so not okay.
[Doorbell]
Girl, you are not even gonna believe.
Uh, my key didn't work.
Oh, yeah, right.
I changed the locks.
After that whole Veronica stalker situation,
I needed to play it safe.
You couldn't heads up somebody?
Well, I didn't think "I changed the locks,"
was an appropriate response to "Alana's bananas.
Wish you were here."
And you're redecorating.
Okay, I'm sensing a theme here.
I'd say it was more like repairing.
Keisha, the house was trashed, don't you remember?
The dining room table was like everywhere.
The chairs were broken.
And I sent you a check.
I know.
I got it.
Thank you.
Hmm.
Well, what's up with you two?
April looks guilty.
Nothing.
Just, um, Antonio left me a couple of reminders of him that I did not need.
Yeah, Keisha, you got to see this.
April.
Ignore her.
Already done.
I came by to grab something to wear to the funeral.
My suitcase has nothing but shimmer.
How are you guys?
Well, you know Malcolm.
He's doing the most.
Planning the funeral, handling statements to the press.
He says he's fine, but he just lost his father.
It's tough.
Of course.
Well, please, send him our love and our regards.
Yeah.
Please do.
[Cell phone vibrating]
Hello?
Yeah, this is April.
She does?
With me?
Do you know what this is regarding?
Because you know what,
I could just send her a check.
Okay.
Thanks.
Who was that?
That was Felicia Price's office.
She wants to see me tomorrow.
That's great.
Isn't it?
I have no idea.
Oh.

She's two years away from having her own vegan cosmetic line.
Get on it.
You.
Good to see you, Felicia.
Please, let me apologize again for the finger.
Oh, stop, stop, stop.
The finger thing made it easier for me to get my Valium script refilled, and clearly you can't afford the dress.
This is about business.

Oh.
Okay.

I need to see even a sliver of the Ariel Goldstein who signed Mac Miller.

It's not.

Oh, yeah.
Me too.
You need to steal his client.
Wait.

But, how do...
Felicia?
Excuse me.
Were you even going to ask me if
I wanted to come work for you?
Why?
Who wouldn't?
Thank you.
Is there anything I can do?
No.
No, this is...
The seating chart is wrong.
The order of speakers is wrong.

I'm sorry.
I don't mean to...
It's just a lot to deal with, you know?
Yeah.
It's okay.
I get it.
Terrance.
He's the one who really should be helping me with all of this.
And where is he?
Why don't you call him?

Ugh.
I need a break from sadness, and funerals, and blah.
Somebody buy me a drink and amuse me.
Hey, Keisha.
You guys all set for tomorrow?
You need me to bring anything?
No.
We're good.
You moved my sofa.
Damn.
Have I been gone that long?
Omar, come help me move this.
Stop.
Just stop.
Leave the sofa where it is.
Fine.
I just thought...
You thought wrong.
A lot of things have changed around here since you left.
I've put things where I want them.
You can't just waltz in here like... you know what?
Never mind.
No.
No.
Like what?
You and I both have a lot of things going on right now.
I don't want to get into this.
Why not?
You've obviously been holding onto something ever since I've gotten back.
So, let's have it.
This may come as a shock to you, but everybody does not revolve around planet Keisha.
You never walk in a room and ask how anybody else is doing.
Oh, really?
Really.
When Malcolm called, you up and disappeared for three months.
You barely checked in.
And now that you're back, you just think that time has stood still?
That the sofa is where you left it, and everything is just gonna pick right back up again?
That's not how it works, Keisha.
Life goes on.
Even if you're not here to see it.
Yes, it does.
And since you think I'm so good at disappearing...
Oh... my...
God.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Miss Price... [Clears throat]
Miss Price, thank you for this opportunity, but, after careful consideration,
I can not accept the terms of your offer.
It's outside of my moral comfort... no.
You know what?
Actually,
I don't even want to work at Price Management.
Because you know why?
I want to be able to look at myself in the mirror.
All right.
It's that girl I was telling you about.
Ugh.
I know, right?
Hank is going to have a fit when he finds out though.
[Laughing]
I owe him after he tried to screw me on that commercial deal.
Oh, don't worry.
She'll never be able to pull it off.
I can't wait to hear the sob story she comes back with.
I'm sure it will be Epoch.
[Laughing]
You know he was still late?
I'm gonna go say something to him.
Yeah, but be cool.
You were late.
All right?
Now, I specifically told you 10 o'clock, but you... you were still late.
Come on, Malcolm.
Let's be honest.
You couldn't care less whether or not the ex-con brother is there.
So, you guys hungry?
I'm out.
No, you're not.
Come here for a second.
What, Malcolm?
Today is not about you.
Okay?
Now I need for you to lose the attitude and just get it together, man.
Think you can do that for pops?
For me?
For you?
Dude, please.
Just go, T. Just go.
Be the hothead just like always.
You don't know what I am.
Pops knew.
Pops knew?
Pops knew, huh?
Maybe that's why he chose me to run the company.
You ever think about that?
What the hell are y'all looking at?
I'm sorry.
We just wanted to make sure everything...
This is family business.
It has nothing to do with you.
Either of you.
I don't usually bring food to people who yell at me, but I'm guessing you haven't eaten in a while.
Thanks.
I'm sorry to...
Hey.
Don't come out here talking about you know what I'm going through.
You're right, I don't.
But I know what it's like to have a family who doesn't get you.
Who tries to turn you into whatever they want you to be.
I've spent years living a life that way.
You are nothing like me.
Maybe not.
But the resentment, the need to make people pay for doubting you, I get that.
You know what's worse than letting your family make choices for you?
Letting anger do it.
It only winds up hurting you more than anyone else.
Why do you care?
I just can't stand to see two people who love each other implode.
Then you better look away.
You're welcome.

Today was a beautiful day.
Your father would have loved it.
How are you?
I honestly don't know.

I've had to breathe.
I know.
But you can breathe now.
I'm done with traveling for a while.
Let's just stay in this suite, relax, and just figure out what's next.
I really want to make sure that everything is stable with the company, and I just feel like people need to see my face around here.
I really hope that doesn't disappointment you.
No.
Not at all.
I'm kind of done with traveling too.
I miss my life here, my friends...
I'm ready to come home.

I didn't want you to think
I was tying you down.

Well, almost.

Listen, I didn't like hearing what you had to say the other day, but you were right.
I just floated off in my happy bubble with Malcolm, and I wasn't here for you, and I'm sorry.
I didn't mean for it to come out that way.
I just...
I kind of lost it.
Yeah, you did.
But it's okay.
I know I can be a little self-absorbed.

But it doesn't mean that you can't count on me.
I will always be ride or die for you, girl.
I know.
Okay.
Let's open it up.
Hi.
I'm sorry.
Do we...
No.
We don't have an appointment.
Hi, I'm April Goldberg and I just need five minutes of your time.
You know Felicia Price, right?
Lady MacBitch.
Sure.
Whose life is she trying to ruin now?
Yours.
She wants Epoch, and she's going to steal him from you.
What?
How do you know that?
She sent me to do it.
Why are you telling me?
Because,
I have a better idea.
Here's the thing.
Bottom line, you can't beat Felicia.
If she wants Epoch, she's gonna get him.
So your best option is to share Epoch with me, off the record of course.
And why would I do that?
Well, with Felicia's reputation and the firm's resources I can double your client's earnings.
So, you share Epoch with me, you lose absolutely nothing.
It's a win-win.
Or you can go up against Felicia, and see how that works out for you.
It's done.
Epoch is officially a client of Price Management.
Take that to business affairs.
They're on the second floor.
Oh, and while you're down there, talk to them about your deal.
Wait, my deal?
Does this this mean I'm hired?
Hopefully it means you're gonna buy a new wardrobe.
With regards to Franks Jewels, LLC and its holdings,
I ask that the company shares be divided equally between my two sons,
Malcolm Franks Junior and Terrance Franks.
I want Terrance to take his rightful place in the company by his brother's side.
What?
No, that can't be right.
Malcolm.
I need to see that will.
There's no way my father wrote that.
Just because you can't respect me, it doesn't mean that pops didn't.
I need to see the will.
Sorry to interrupt, ladies and gentlemen, but we have an urgent matter that couldn't wait.
My client and I are here to contest the last will and testament of Mr. Malcolm Franks Senior.
Who the hell are you?

How are you?
Yeah, I understand.

No.
I would love a drink.
I definitely need one.
Okay, have a seat.
What can I get you?
I would love a vodka tonic.
Vodka tonic coming right up.
Tough day at the office?
You have no idea.
Actually, you probably do.
I mean, we all have them, right?
Technically, I don't have an office, but I do have my bad days, for sure.
I hate seeing the pressure these kids are under, you know?
In fact, this kid in Ohio almost lost a tryout because of you.
Because of me?
Mm-hmm.
So the day after we meet,
I'm in Ohio to watch supposed next LeBron James play, right?
But, I can barely focus, because all I can think about is being trapped in an elevator with you.
Oh, okay.
So I ruined the chances for the next LeBron James.
Not quite.
[Laughter]
No, I mean this guy definitely owes you a basket of muffins or something, because I was definitely in a much better mood thanks to you.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
Well, now I'm in a really good mood thanks to you.
I'd like to put you in a better mood.
Is that so?
Mm-hmm.
How's that?
Oh, I'm, definitely in a better mood.
So what's after better?
I could think of a few things.
You know, making out like this on the couch reminds me of high school.
Scared your parents might come in and catch us?
Don't worry.
We're grown ups, we won't get into any trouble.
I'm sorry, what did you say?
I said we're not gonna get in trouble.
Promise.
Um.
I'm sorry.
I can't do this, Alec.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I mean, nothing with you, obviously.
Hello, you are perfect.
Look, I know this would be a lot of fun, and that it would make me feel a lot better, but, you know, just for one night, because, after that, then it's
just gonna be a month of,
"when am I gonna see him again?"
And do I even want to see him again?
And should I have slept with this guy on the first date?
And why even mess with a guy who
"doesn't live in my same city?"
I've got to make some changes.
Three months ago, I was running after this guy, literally, through a marathon, in the opposite direction of the runners, begging for him to take me back.
Wow.
Yes, wow, exactly.
I mean, if I am gonna be an adult, I need to start acting like one, and, as much as
I would love the sexy diversion from all the troubles in my life right now, and that bomb that just dropped on my business,
I know that,
I just know that this is just gonna get me in more trouble.
So this isn't happening.
I'm sorry.
Me too.
I'm gonna go, Alec.
Is it okay if I hold onto your number?
Hell, yeah.
Okay.
Good.
Good.
You know, just in case I change my mind.
Right.
Okay, bye.

Get your dicks.
You haven't killed anybody yet, you prick.
Let's go.
So what's got everyone hot and bothered, Chief?
We got some bad guys we need you to take care of.
And a couple of good guys we'd like back.
Now, one of the Agency's local assets in Congo... uncovered a covert military training camp... with a distinct Al-Qaeda signature.
Got a pad, new guy?
Take notes.
The asset and her C.I.A. handler... attempted physical confirmation... but were captured in the process.
We believe these camps engage in significant arms dealing as well.
I'd just as soon flatten this place from 10,000 feet... but there's a strong probability that they have our agent and his asset.
Now, the asset is a local informant...
Zoe Jelani.
French-African.
Born in Marrakech, Morocco.
Lives in Kinshasa, Congo.
She's smart, and she's a survivor.
Her C.I.A. handler is Tom Seborn.
He recruited her, and she quickly became his most valuable source with HUMINT.
Now, actionable intel from Jelani... resulted in the takedown of several major smuggling kingpins except one.
We know he goes by the name Malin.
But that's all we know.
We have no photos, no description.
This guy's invisible and a growing threat.
We believe he's supplying this camp with weapons.
Now, the leader of this camp is this man...
General Japhet Tonga.
A major rebel, figure in the civil war wanted for war crimes, genocide and all that other Anderson Cooper bullshit.
He's a major asshole.
- What's his affiliation with Al-Qaeda?
- We're not sure.
But he understands that zealotry plus money equals power, and that's his god.
We are gonna quickly and not so quietly take it apart for him.
I like dealing with you.
You always deliver.
Yeah.
I want you to bring me more people from abroad...
I can do business with.
I can do it.
No problem.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Your team will execute an insertion... 15 klicks from the target area at exactly 0200 hours.
We have a pilot with a commercial chopper and local knowledge.
He'll get you in undetected.
You will have U.A.V. support.
Reaper will clear the perimeter and provide cover fire as needed.
You will locate and extract our people or confirm that they are dead or off-site, at which point, you will exfiltrate... and our bot will render the camp inoperable.
- Now go do this shit!
- Yes, sir.
You heard him.

California, this is Gray Base One.
We have an empty bird.
Our team will be on the ground forthwith.
Copy, Gray Base One.
I'm scrambled and 20 klicks out.
Stay focused.
- We are clean and in position.
- Copy.
Coming in hot.
You hear Pac-Man on comms?
"Coming in hot"?
Wish I was sitting on my ass playing video games all day too.
Then your balls would never have dropped.
Looks like they still haven't.
Keep it tight.
We go in two.
Is that a pool?
It would appear so.
Hey!
I love this place.
Stand up and shake it for the general.
Stand up.
Come on.
Shake it for the general.
Shake it for the general.
Yeah?
Okay.
Sit down.

Boom.

Please confirm status.

Bubba.
Sir.
Check down below.
Sir.
- Mirror.
- Come, you American pigs.
Come on!
Saw this in a movie once.
Ain't gonna improve your looks though.
Hello, hello.
You, shoot that thing.
You American dogs.
Fuck!
Who the fuck are you?
I'm the tooth fairy.
I'm gonna have to owe you a nickel.
Gray Base One, location secured.
We have hands on Tonga.
That was some Old Testament destruction there, gentlemen.
Outstanding.
Appreciate the love.
Oh, and one more thing.
Tell California he can go fuck himself.
This look like an Al-Qaeda training camp to you?
Fuck.
This ain't jihad.
There's no monkey bars.
That's a dead giveaway.
What are you up to here, Tonga?
Where are the prisoners?
Where are the fucking prisoners?
Better talk.
Hmm?
Wait, wait.
After you.
Wait, wait.
- Secure him.
- Help me!
Help me!
Clear.
Help me!
Help!
Calm down.
Calm down.
We're U.S. Navy SEALs and we're your extraction team.
- Can you please identify yourself?
- Zoe Jelani.
- And this man?
- Seborn.
Get me out of here.
- Are you injured?
- I don't know.
Put your arm around me.
Put your arm around me.
C.I.A. gonna have a good time with you.
I'm gonna make sure of it.
You set this woman free.
You American pigs.
I'll tell you this.
She is...
Move back!
Move back!
Sit in the chair!
Sit in the chair!
Damn.
Shit.
Shit.
Oui.
They're gonna want to spend a couple of weeks at least debriefing you somewhere safe.
Out of the country, all right?
Chief, I...
What the fuck?
Dan, what is it?
Uh, I think we got something.
Excuse me.
Vic.
Let's go.
I don't know what you did to her, but let's just say you got served.
Reinforced door.
Be ready for anything, gentlemen.
Copy that.
Popping the lock.
- When you're ready, call it.
- Sir.
Blow the lock in three.
Clear.
That's some serious fuck-you money.
It's a good thing we're not in this for the money.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, good thing.
Now why would the general here have all this cash on hand?
Sir.
Those are troop designations.
It's got every entry point covered.
Whatever that is, he's guarding it like Fort Knox.
It's a mine, and he's been paid a lot of money to make sure no one knows it exists.
Question is, what's he pulling out?
Only two things come out of the ground in this region...
Copper... and uranium.
I discovered this place while tracking an illegal arms dealer.
Malin.
That's right.
We knew Tonga was receiving weapons, but what we didn't know is that he wasn't buying them.
- They were payment for his services.
- He's working with Malin.
- Shit.
- He's working for Malin... who's been stockpiling yellowcake uranium for a major sale.
Sir.
According to this, there's been a major influx of activity around the mine.
- Then I guess the sale's happening soon.
- Thirty-six hours.
And how would you know that exactly?
Tonga.
Sure.
Let's go.
You're bullshitting me.
We gotta keep going.
We've a patch-through.
Case.
I'm sitting here with the C.I.A.
How solid is your intel on the mine and this yellowcake sale?
Just over 100%.
All right.
Here's the deal.
I will have no other resources in the area, and we're obviously on the clock.
I need your team to pull a double.
- Sir?
- At this time,
I have no authorization... for an extra team or air support without confirmation, except for an extraction.
Okay.
Maybe I wasn't clear about the yellowcake.
It's the uranium type.
Uranium's legally mined in that region... and there are about 10 international agencies... counting every ounce of yellowcake produced... making damn sure what your intel says is happening never happens.
So you can imagine the kind of politics that we...
Listen, Case.
The guys in D.C. cried wolf about this African yellowcake once before.
We both know how that turned out.
Yes, I do.
Listen.
I need you standing on top of that shit... smoking gun in hand, before any of this is on the record.
Now, your mission is to confirm that mine is producing uranium... stop the sale and expose the buyer... and you gotta do it with what you showed up with.
You got better intel this time, right?
That'll be a giant pain in the ass, sir.
I know.
Consider it done.
Copy.
You're fighting a war.
This ain't a goddamn game.
I got deja vu.
That's a bag of dicks, chief.
Sounds fubar.
I second your fubar, and I raise you a fugly.
Hooyah.
Hey.
- If it don't suck...
- We don't do it.
What else can you tell me about the mine?
I'll tell you on the way.
I'm going with you.
No, I don't think so.
I'm the only one who knows this area and where Tonga's troops are.
You need me.
D'accord?
Sir?
Yeah.
Case on the line.
Thanks.
Listen.
The C.I.A. wants their money.
Just bury it with a G.P.S. tracker.
They'll get it later.
Copy.
Your sat phone is our only eyes and ears now.
No more direct contact with the comms.
Roger that.
Good luck.
- Collins.
- Sir.
Lose this and we're sending smoke signals.
No pressure.
We gotta bury the money.
- C.I.A.?
- Yup.
Just the dollars then.
- Bubba.
- Sir!
You gotta dig a hole, bury all the US currency.
And put a tracker on it.
Sir.
So we're here.
There's about 25 klicks between us and the mine.
This is the road.
It's heavily patrolled with Tonga's soldiers.
Even with Tonga dead, Malin will have another general take over operations.
So we go around.
The terrain is very difficult.
It would take us days.
Nothing new there.
Tell me what you know about him.
Very little, unfortunately.
We don't know if he's one person or a network.
But he's controlled the illegal arms trade in Congo for years.
Now he's moved on to brokering uranium.
No one knows his real name.
Malin is French.
For "sly," like a fox.
Yeah.
Bubba.
Sir.
We got two days of rations and water left.
Ordnance is the issue though.
Rounds are down to 40%.
Hey, lady.
Here.
Take it.
Ever used one of these?
I'll take that as a yes.
Let's do it.
We need to follow this river up east to get to the first pass.
Let's take the boat.
We'll take it quietly.
Hostile, 3:00.
Start her up, Bubba.
They are stealing the boat!
They are stealing the boat!
- Here they come.
- Cover fire!
Cover fire!
Go!
Go!
Dan, right flank!
Right!
Fire!
More hostiles, 9:00.
Incoming.
Get down!
Watch out, Bubba!
Turn around.
We gotta get Bubba.
Over here, guys.
Over here!
- Guys.
Pick me up!
- Come on.
We can make it.
Bubba!
Bubba, hold your hand out.
Bubba, give me your hand.
Come on.
Pull him up.
Pull him up.
Come on.
Move.
Faster.
Faster.
Fuck!
It's a dead end.
Turn left.
Turn left!
Dan, Vic!
Right flank!
We're dead in the water!
Ah, fuck!
Case, look out!
The boat!
The boat!
Case, the boat!
Get out!
- Case!
- Look out!
Case!
Keep moving.
Don't stop!
Don't stop!
Let's go.
Come on.
Go, go, go!
I'll cover you.
Go!
Dan!
Dan!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
They fragged Dan, man.
Jesus Christ!
He's all over the fucking place!
Follow the river.
Follow the river.
We gotta go.
I was supposed to watch him!
Keep it tight.
It's not your fault, all right?
There's nothing you could have done.
Now we need you, buddy.
Okay?
So let's go.
Let's go.
Come on.
Let's go.
Fuck!
Confirmed.
The link is no longer active.
We should assume the worst.
No, we shouldn't.
Request satellite imaging on that coordinate... five minutes on either side of the signal fail.
Fuck!
We've lost comms.
Dan had the fucking sat phone.
We need to set up the 4-M.C. Comms?
We've lost comms?
What the fuck about the man we just lost?
Vic!
Two, six, 10.
Shut your fucking cockhole, Bubba.
You all right, Bubs?
Let's take a look at this.
You all right?
Yeah.
You?
Yeah.
Here.
Okay?
Okay.
It's not your first time being shot, huh?
It's probably not my last.
I hope it is.
Tell me if it hurts.
It's fine.
Let's just fix that.
Under here.
Mmm.
Should do it.
Okay?
Thank you.
All right.
Here.
That's good.
What?
You're dangerous.
You know that?
You have no idea.
Sir, we got some smoke up ahead.
Let's check it out.
- What the fuck happened here?
- Tonga happened.
It's flamethrower accelerant.
I guess from that same batch of goodies those vz. 58s came from.
Jesus.
Why would Tonga do this?
These people are no threat to him.
They chose the wrong side.
Throw a dart round here and you hit a different rebel faction.
What side is the wrong side?
Any side but Tonga's.
- What's he saying?
- "Die, devil, die."
We're not here to hurt you.
We're here to help.
All right?
Hey, kid.
Hey, kid.
Kid.
Kid.
Look.
All right?
Jay.
Put that down.
Just trying to protect what's left of his village.
Hey, kid.
Kid, come here.
Look.
Shake my hand.
Come on.
Come on.
Put that down.
Shake my hand.
Hey.
Hey.
You all right?
For the last week, the villagers saw a convoy of trucks... coming through the pass every morning about an hour after sunup.
- Convoy comes every day?
- Every day.
You're thinking about hitching a ride?
Fighting isn't the only thing we're good at.
Hey, Bubba.
Sir.
Come here.
All right.
I got good news and really good news.
Good news is you boys have exactly one hour to cop some Z's.
Think of it as a mini vacation.
And the really good news?
Then we're gonna breach a moving convoy... loaded with Tonga's troops.
You're welcome.
Goddamn.
Damn.
That's real good news.
He's due.
Fuck him.
I'm due.
Know what Dan would have said.
All right.
I better help the new guy with the truck.
He'll probably fuck it up.
Fucking will.
How'd you learn to shoot like that?
When I was 12, I pretended I was a boy and joined the army in Kinshasa.
It was during the civil war, so there was no training, no physicals... nothing.
They just took you straight to the battlefield with your own clothes.
When they discovered I was a girl I was already leading a unit... so they kept me.
No.
I don't buy it.
What?
Why?
It's hard to believe you could ever have been mistaken for a boy.
So you said fighting wasn't the only thing you were good at?
It isn't.
Come here.
- So what's the M.O., sir?
- Give me a minute.
Just trying to put all the pieces together.
Thinking we do the Korengal Valley thing.
Which one?
First one.
I remember.
That got fucked up, right?
Yeah, but it was a better plan.
And I don't see any goat herders around here, do you?
All right.
First one it is.
So what are we doing?
How complicated is this?
Extremely.
Look.
- The truck stops there, right?
- Uh-huh.
We get on.
Okay.
Get down.
You, you, you!
Go, go, go!
Now!
- Go.
Go.
- Get in there.
Get in there.
Quick.
Get on the floor.
Get on the ground.
Okay.
Everyone in position.
One, two, three.
Let's go.
We need to assume... some of the operators are still viable.
Rescue protocol should give me at least one robot... start clearing some of the bad guys out of the area... give who is ever left out there... some sort of sporting chance.
Yes, sir.
I'm on it.
Thank you, Collins.
Never assume the worst, Parker.
Never.
Sir.
Even if it is true.
I'm the new general in charge here, so hurry up.
Move it.
Faster, faster.
Faster, faster.
Faster, faster.
How long do we have until this rat trap stops?
Forty-five minutes, an hour at the most.
Carb up, fellas.
There might be some drama in the second half.
Sir, I think we got something here.
Farsi.
Those markings.
Takavar.
Iranian special forces.
Maybe we got the buyer.
I'd imagine we're looking at their good-faith deposit.
Comms.
Jackpot.
Looks like it might be a good day after all.
Bubba, get your ass over here.
Stop fiddling'.
If we can get hold of CENTCOM... and let them know that we're mission forward... they might not flatten the place before we get there.
- How's your Persian, bro?
- Fuckin' awesome.
If it was backwards.
Don't worry, 'cause all you have to do is find a satcom frequency... and we can tap into our own mission channel.
Ticktock.
Come on.
California, please take out all enemy hostiles.
Did that person sound like...
Four klicks to target.
Weapons are hot.
Shit.
They're taking out the mines.
Without confirming the intel, it'll be next to impossible to get that approved.
How long have we been off-line?
Eight hours and change.
Ricks has probably initiated rescue measures.
But without visual confirmation or a request from us, he cannot send another team.
He'll be looking for the most visible concentration of enemy hostiles.
Get the low-hanging fruit first.
He could put a bird in the air, clear out the hostiles from the rescue perimeter... assuming we're still operational.
So cavalry's gonna take care of some bad guys for us.
Good.
We in the convoy full of bad guys, numbnuts.
Put your helmet on, Bubba.
People, we have about 30 seconds to un-fuck ourselves.
What are we gonna do?
River, 20 seconds.
Hey, don't you think we should confirm strike?
Confirmed!
- It's a hit.
- Confirmed hit.
Everyone out!
- Go in for a second sweep.
- Copy that.
Incoming!
- Move out.
On me!
- Go, go, go!
Bubba!
Bubba, get out!
- It's a hit.
- Roger that.
Confirmed hit.
What the?
Those are our guys.
- California, abort mission!
Abort!
- Shit!
Goddamn it!
We got a goddamn situation here!
Come on, Bubs.
I got you.
Stay with me, man.
Stay with me.
Come on.
- Get down here!
- Cover me.
I'm going in.
Help me get him out.
Help me get him out.
He's still breathing.
I got him.
We got you, Bubs.
One, two, three.
- Get his hand grenades.
- Pull his vest off.
All right.
Gun over.
Watch his face.
Gun over.
- We gotta stop the bleeding.
- Over his face.
- Open him up.
- Vic!
Jam as much of that in the wound as possible.
Gauze.
Easy, Bubs.
Easy.
Easy.
You're okay.
Easy.
You're all right, buddy.
Look at me.
Look at me.
You're all right.
Bubba, look at me.
Just breathe.
Take it easy.
Just keep breathing.
Does this hole qualify me for the good shit, sir?
Close enough.
You're all right.
It's okay, kid.
Let's tie this off.
Let's get that shirt off.
Come on.
Up you go, Bubs.
- Get him on his feet.
- There you go.
Getting some color back.
You're blushing.
- Here you go.
- Just tie it off.
All right.
On three.
One, two, three.
Hey.
All right, look at me.
Are you doing good?
Sir.
Sorry about the truck, sir.
Don't mention it.
Come on.
You all right?
Yes, sir.
You good?
Yeah.
How much further?
A couple of hours.
Hey, what was in that syringe?
A little of everything, I expect.
Collins, confirm the head count.
I still show five.
Okay, we lost one of our boys.
But I don't think, for the record... we can positively I.D. the individuals on the ground as our own.
But, sir, I think it's clear...
Since we cannot make a positive ID... this remains an official search-and-rescue operation... and we can therefore keep our bird on scene.
So in case those happen to be our boys... we should let them know we have eyes on them.
California, this is Gray Base One.
Please stand by for orders.
Gray Base One, California standing by.
Again?
Seriously?
These guys don't fight from 200 feet.
If they're down this low, it's to say, "Hey, we know you're up and running."
Mind if I do the honors?
Be my guest.
I believe we have confirmation our team understands eyes are back on.
You think, Parker?
All right.
Let's get California back up top.
Eyes only until they need us.
- California, pull back.
- Gray Base One, California will comply.
We're almost there.
The mines are just on the other side of this pass.
We're clear.
Okay, close the gate.
Let's go.
Victor.
See the mine shaft?
Two guard detachments, both sheltered.
Guards are staying put.
So any satellite images will show this place is still inactive.
Which means Malin's hideout will be underground.
A foxhole.
Definitely.
The few things we've learned about Malin... have always been the opposite of what we assumed.
Collins, let's get up close and personal in case they need the support.
Yes, sir.
California, this is Gray Base One.
Please adjust to an 8K ceiling for max visual and pending support.
Gray Base One, California will comply.
Repeat.
Will comply.
So what's the plan?
Kamikaze with a twist?
I got you.
Kamikaze... with a twist?
You're gonna love this one.
Hey, who's that?
Watch out.
Nobody's in the truck.
Go, go, go.
- Another fuckin' .50-cal.
- Grenade!
Don't stop.
Keep moving.
Keep moving.
- Bubba!
- Grenade!
Let's go!
Move up!
Case.
What you got?
Map.
You guys take the main entrance.
I'll take the elevator.
We'll meet in the middle.
Fuckin' maverick.
I got you.
All right.
On me.
We ain't here to hurt you.
- They're just miners.
- All right.
Stack up.
Boys ready to go down the rabbit hole?
That's why we came, right?
Goddamn it.
On your 6:00, Case.
On your 6:00.
This has to be the spot.
Yeah.
These guys seem pretty motivated.
Guarding the king's quarters.
Jay, me and you take the right flank.
The rest of you...
Bubba, on me.
Bubba, go.
Sir.
Get down!
- Goddamn it.
- B!
Bubba, you all right?
I'll check if it's over here.
Zoe, wait.
Stay together.
Goddamn it.
Hey, B. Bubs.
Vic, we're on your 6:00.
- What happened?
- A knife.
- You okay?
Where's Zoe?
- Went that way.
We'll take that section, find her.
Look after Bubs.
Go.
I've got him.
Hey.
Hey, B. Bubs, hang in there, kid.
Malin better be still alive.
Motherfucker!
Who betrayed me?
Who, mother cocksucker?
You've gotta be shitting me.
Tail pipe, now.
Shit!
- You got a missile lock.
- I know.
- All right.
Evasive action.
- Countermeasure engaged.
California, Gray Base One.
We seem to have lost our feed.
Please advise.
You two, go to the safe house.
Set up a meeting.
What the hell's going on?
Get Commander Ricks on the line right now.
Yes, ma'am.
You two, come with me.
Y'all think that Zoe chick's gonna be all right?
Haven't you been paying attention?
This lady knows exactly what she's doing.
Left.
Got an office down here?
I'm gonna do a sweep.
Be back in two minutes.
All right.
Sweep done, man.
All clear.
No sign of Zoe.
No sign of guards.
No sign of nothing.
- I just e-mailed CENTCOM.
- E-mail?
Yeah, no landline.
Malin's network.
The best I could do.
Commander, you need to see this.
You're not gonna believe it... but a message from the team was just routed to us from Little Creek.
What?
They sent an e-mail to their home base... requesting immediate medevac.
An e-mail?
That's brilliant.
Collins, we need the helicopter.
I need field medics on standby.
We got a SEAL down.
I repeat.
We got a SEAL down.
Make it happen, goddamn it.
Figure it out.
Where is this Malin anyway, the yellowcake?
I don't know.
Soldiers for hire don't fight like that to protect an empty nest.
Malin's here.
I'm sure of it.
We're missing something.
Yeah, like?
So Malin pays Tonga to secure the area... so he can quietly stockpile yellowcake for a huge sale.
But there's a problem when you pay an army for protection.
Yeah, like who's gonna protect you from the army?
Exactly.
So Tonga realizes that the shit he's paid to protect... is worth more than he's being paid to protect it.
He becomes a threat.
Malin has no way of taking him out.
It turns out he don't need to.
We do it for him.
Who pushed over the first domino?
We took out Tonga's camp based on intel from the local asset...
Zoe Jelani.
She got caught on purpose.
No, she didn't.
That was her one mistake.
Think about it.
She's a proven local asset doing what?
Ratting out her competition.
So she's got a perfect record... because all she has to do is point to Tonga's training camp... and scream "Al-Qaeda" and we just vaporize it.
Yep.
And physical confirmation is needed now.
And she gets caught somehow... by Tonga... the one person that can ID her.
He was about to tell us exactly who she was.
So she offs him.
And we buy it.
Why wouldn't we?
I'm sure he did torture her.
Then she tells us about the yellowcake... convinces us to walk her through the gauntlet... so she doesn't miss her sale.
We still alive, right?
You do know how to pick 'em, Case.
Let's go get her.
Damn straight.
Run, run.
Why can't you like nice women, Case?
Vic, Bubba!
Vic, Bubba!
Get outta here!
Now!
What the fuck's going on?
What's all the noise?
No, no, no.
Bubba, Vic.
- Case.
- We gotta get them out.
Case, we gotta go.
Case, we gotta go, man.
Case, we gotta go.
We gotta go!
Move it.
Right.
We should go now.
Let's go.
Fuck!
Turn around.
Fuck.
Shit.
Come on, faster.
Kill them.
Jay!
Fuck, he's still alive.
Grab him.
We will use him.
- What about the other one?
- He's as good as dead.
Jay!
Just you?
Get us out of here, fast.
You got comms with Ricks?
Delta channel.
Ricks, Case on Delta channel.
- Come in.
Do you read?
- Go for Ricks.
Vic and Bubba didn't make it.
So you have three seals down there that need to come home.
And Ricks... they got Jay.
- What do you mean, they got Jay?
- Malin has him.
- How the fuck did that happen?
- The fuckin' asset is Malin.
What the fuck you want from me anyway?
You fuckin' missing Case?
I'll ask the questions.
Fuckin' bitch.
What the fuck do you think I know that can help you?
Nothing.
Kinshasa is ground zero for Malin's smuggling pipeline.
She probably has a distribution point... where she can ship out small, untraceable loads.
And now we know every bit of intel the C.I.A. has on Malin... was planted by Malin.
Okay, Case, we got three dead SEALs.
And now they got a live SEAL as a bonus.
Why the fuck are you torturing me?
Come on.
I'm not torturing you.
I'm giving you a taste... of what your new life will be like in Iran.
We know she operates from the slums.
I'm guessing the intel she was pushing never pointed there.
He's right.
Can you think of a better place to set up shop?
The cops won't go near it.
It's like another planet in there with mob rule.
Fuckin' bitch.
You might want to show a little respect.
She's protected in there.
All these warlords treat their territory the same.
Like a tribal kingdom.
We saw it in Mog back in '06.
Find me the tallest building in the slums... or directly adjacent.
She may or may not be there, but even money says she controls it.
Let's do it.
Do it.
We got an apartment complex.
Nsele Tower.
It's the tallest structure in the area.
It's right on the perimeter.
What do you think?
It's a place to start, and I'm scrambling a team to recon with you.
How long?
Two and a half hours, on the inside.
That's too long.
The window might be closed by then.
I'm gonna drop in solo.
I don't want you dropping in with nothing but your dick in your hand.
- I appreciate it.
- Here.
Take my cell phone.
Now I'm just gonna do lead recon.
I won't shake the tree until the cavalry gets there.
No.
Chase, I don't like it.
Come on, Ricks.
We're probably wrong anyway.
At least I can start eliminating possible locations, narrow the options.
Hello?
Excuse me.
Can I borrow these?
Okay, Case, listen to me.
Keep your head down and your mouth shut.
I'm done losing men today.
Me too.
Fuck me.
Ricks, got a visual on the van.
- Case, talk to me.
- Hold on, I'll take a closer look.
Empty.
Wait.
I hear something.
I'll get back to you.
I got Case again for you.
Hey, Ricks.
I think I got something for you.
Trace that voice.
Get that?
Got it.
We've confirmed the buyer is an Iranian operative named Amjad... with ties to the terrorist cell Al-Shabaab.
Amjad will probably take the final shipment of the uranium... but we suspect the final payment will be at Malin's safe house... where she is most likely holding Jay.
- Location?
- Near the old market.
Working the sat right now.
But if she hasn't broken up the payload... there should be enough to nail down the uranium signature.
Case, just observe.
Bravo is close.
They're 20 klicks out.
I gotta keep moving.
He'll lead me to Malin.
I'm not losing Jay.
Case?
He's gonna do it.
He's gotta.
Over there.
There he is.
- This way, everybody.
- Go, go, go.
- Go, go, go.
- Come on, you assholes!
Grenade!
Get back!
Get back!
Oh, you wanna play kamikaze?
Let's play kamikaze.
Get back!
Get back!
Grenade.
Shit.
Guess who.
Fire!
Thanks, Jay.
- Hello.
- You're late.
Navy SEAL, motherfucker.
There are two more detachments coming to get me out of here.
You and your friend are standing in your own grave.
How many villages are dying of radiation poisoning from work in your mine?
What do you think that's like?
I can't even imagine.
You won't have to.
Do it.
Do it.
Come on.
Do it.
You Americans are so weak.
Without your drones and missiles, you'd be nothing.
Even if you kill me, another will take my place... probably hired with the same money.
Helping people like Tonga... sacrificing innocent people... sacrificing my friends.
It has to stop.
Well, stop this.
Oh, God.
You motherfucker!
No, don't go away!
Help me!
Help me!
That is a whole lot of nuke juice.
Enough to get you in the superpower club.
Comfortable, Commander?
You realize that everybody around you is wearing a hazmat suit, right?
We're immune to nukes.
So how about a ride out of this shit hole?
Half a klick away.
I want you two to take some "R" and "R," gentlemen.
And I want you to make it count.
Thanks, Chief.
Chief.
Where should we go?
Jay, shift your weight.
Shut up, old man.
This ain't "E" and "E," it's "R" and "R" for me.
You know...
I haven't thanked you yet.
For what?
Your excellent work in picking a vacation spot.
Come on, man.
You know I was born to roll like this.
Yes, I do.
Check this kid out.
Yep, the C.I.A. is gonna be pissed.
Today, I want you to know something:
That the general loves you.
But there are some of you here-
I want to show you today... what happens when you choose the wrong side... when you betray Tonga.
Bring me his wife.
I want to show you what happens when you dont listen.
- No.
- Like this man here.
This is how a genius plays.
Im like Jordan on the pool table, understand?
Jordan on the fuckin pool table.
You got me, Case?
Watch this.
Get your head out of my shot, man.
Watch
- Watch it.
No.
No.
All right.
Its cool, man.
Its cool.
You know I dont do IOUs, right?
Better have double that stack in your pocket... or were gonna have ourselves a situation.
You are a lucky motherfucker, Case.
Thats all Im gonna say about it.
I got the same amount of luck as the next guy.
- Just time mine better.
- Youre an asshole.
Its your fault.
You taught him how to play the game back in Beirut.
- Sir.
- Chief.
- Jay.
Case.
- Commander.
- You here for a game?
- I already owe you too much.
Come on, Chief.
Double or nothing.
- I thought you didnt take IOUs.
- I dont give you IOUs.
Hey.
Wheres the rest of the team?
Well, the smooth dogs are working on some frog hogs... and new guys over there soaking up some Steinbeck.
- Lets go.
- All right.
Is that Bubba?
Top of his class at Little Creek.
Bubba!
Youre about to get your cherry popped in Africa, son.
- How you feel about that?
- Ecstatic, Commander.
Needs popping.
You know, Case is the only one in my fire team I allow to think.
- What are you doing?
- Getting my thinking out of the way, sir.
- Good.
Lets go.
- Ready to go.
This is my rifle This is my gun
This is my rifle This is my gun
Come on, Bubba!
Hey, guys.
- Ready to focus now, gentlemen?
- Always, Senior.
The Navy only gave us one speed, Senior:
Full.
Im sure these fine ladies are happy to hear it.
Get your dicks.
You havent killed anybody yet, you prick.
Lets go.
So whats got everyone hot and bothered, Chief?
We got some bad guys we need you to go take care of.
And a couple of good guys wed like back.
Now, one of the Agencys local assets in Congo... uncovered a covert military training camp... with a distinct Al-Qaeda signature.
Got a pad, new guy?
Take notes.
The asset and her CIA handler attempted physical confirmation... but were captured in the process.
We believe these camps engage in significant arms dealing as well.
I d just as soon flatten this place from 10,000 feet... but theres a strong probability that they have our agent and his asset.
Now, the asset is a local informant- Zoe Jelani.
French-African.
Born in Marrakech, Morocco.
Lives in Kinshasa, Congo.
Shes smart and shes a survivor.
Her CIA handler is Tom Seborn.
He recruited her, and she quickly became his most valuable source with HUMINT.
Now, actionable intel from Jelani... resulted in the takedown of several major smuggling kingpins... except one.
We know he goes by the name Malin.
But thats all we know.
We have no photos, no description.
This guys invisible and a growing threat.
We believe hes supplying this camp with weapons.
Now, the leader of this camp is this man-
General Japhet Tonga.
A major rebel, figure in the civil war... wanted for war crimes, genocide... and all that other Anderson Cooper bullshit.
Hes a major asshole.
- Whats his affiliation with Al-Qaeda?
- Were not sure.
But he understands that zealotry plus money equals power... and thats his god.
We are gonna quickly and not so quietly take it apart for him.
I like dealing with you.
- You always deliver.
- Yeah.
I want you to bring me more people from abroad...
- I can do business with.
- I can do it.
No problem.
Good.
Good.
Your team will execute an insertion... 15 klicks from the target area at exactly 0200 hours.
We have a pilot with a commercial chopper and local knowledge.
Hell get you in undetected.
You will have UA Vsupport.
Reaper will clear the perimeter and provide cover fire as needed.
You will locate and extract our people or confirm that they are dead or off-site.
At which point, you will exfiltrate... and our bot will render the camp inoperable.
- Now go do this shit!
- Yes, sir.
You heard him.
- Fuck, yeah.
- Hooyah.
Hey, Case.
- The fuck is this?
- Commercial chopper.
Undercover.
Dont worry.
Bread and butter.
- Nice Koala.
- Yep.
Lets get it on.
California, this is Gray Base One.
We have an empty bird.
Our team will be on the ground forthwith.
Copy, Gray Base One.
Im scrambled and 20 klicks out.
Stay focused.
- We are clean and in position.
- Copy.
Coming in hot.
You hear Pac-Man on comms?
Coming in hot?
Wish I was sitting on my ass playing video games all day too.
Then your balls would never have dropped.
Looks like they still havent.
Keep it tight.
We go in two.
Is that a pool?
It would appear so.
Hey!
I love this place.
Stand up and shake it for the general.
Stand up.
Come on.
Shake it for the general.
Shake it for the general.
Yeah?
Okay.
Sit down.
Send it.
California, Gray Base One.
Please clear a path for my boys.
Roger that.
Hey!
Do something!
Hey!
Do something!
Go in for a second sweep.
Boom.
California, our view is compromised.
Please confirm status.
Gray Base One, California.
Perimeter is clear.
Heads up, Case.
Heads up.
Okay.
What you got?
Get your game face on, boys.
Autopilot engage.
Clear!
Watch your 6:00, Case.
Watch your 6:00.
Go, go, go!

Curveball, sir!
Whoa!
Behind the wall.
I got em.

Curveball.
We got you.

Bubba, PKG.
Throw some bullets.
Lets go, Jay.
Move in!
Move in!
Bubba, on me!
Move in.
Clear.
- Bubba.
- Sir.
- Check down below.
- Sir.
- Mirror.
- Come, you American pigs.
Come on!
- Saw this in a movie once.
- Aint gonna improve your looks though.
- Hello, hello.
- You, shoot that thing.
You American dogs.
Fuck!
Who the fuck are you?
Im the tooth fairy.
Im gonna have to owe you a nickel.
Gray Base One, location secured.
We have hands on Tonga.
That was some Old Testament destruction there, gentlemen.
- Outstanding.
- Appreciate the love.
Oh, and one more thing.
Tell California he can go fuck himself.
This look like an Al-Qaeda training camp to you?
Fuck.
This aint jihad.
Theres no monkey bars.
Thats a dead giveaway.
What are you up to here, Tonga?
Where are the prisoners?
Where are the fucking prisoners?
Better talk.
Hmm?
Wait, wait.
After you.
Wait, wait.
- Secure him.
- Help me!
Help me!
Clear.
Help me!
Help!
Calm down.
Calm down.
Were US Navy SEALs and were your extraction team.
- Can you please identify yourself?
- Zoe Jelani.
- And this man?
- Seborn.
Get me out of here.
- Are you injured?
- I dont know.
Put your arm around me.
Put your arm around me.
CIA gonna have a good time with you.
Im gonna make sure of it.
You set this woman free.
You American pigs.
Ill tell you this.
She is-
Move back!
Move back!
Sit in the chair!
Sit in the chair!
Damn.
Shit.
Shit.
Oui.
Theyre gonna want to spend a couple of weeks at least... debriefing you somewhere safe.
- Out of the country, all right?
- Chief, I-
What the fuck?
Dan, what is it?
Uh, I think we got something.
Excuse me.
Vic.
Lets go.
I dont know what you did to her, but lets just say you got served.
Reinforced door.
- Be ready for anything, gentlemen.
- Copy that.
Popping the lock.
- When youre ready, call it.
- Sir.
Blow the lock in three.
Clear.
Thats some serious fuck-you money.
Its a good thing were not in this for the money.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, good thing.
Now why would the general here have all this cash on hand?
Sir.
Those are troop designations.
Its got every entry point covered.
Whatever that is, hes guarding it like Fort Knox.
Its a mine, and hes been paid a lot of money... to make sure no one knows it exists.
Question is, whats he pulling out?
Only two things come out of the ground in this region-
Copper... and uranium.
I discovered this place while tracking an illegal arms dealer.
- Malin.
- Thats right.
We knew Tonga was receiving weapons... but what we didnt know is that he wasnt buying them.
- They were payment for his services.
- Hes working with Malin.
- Shit.
- Hes working for Malin... whos been stockpiling yellowcake uranium for a major sale.
Sir.
According to this, theres been a major influx of activity around the mine.
Then I guess the sales happening soon.
Thirty-six hours.
And how would you know that exactly?
Tonga.
Sure.
Lets go.
Youre bullshitting me.
We gotta keep going.
Weve a patch-through.
Case.
Im sitting here with the CIA.
How solid is your intel on the mine and this yellowcake sale?
Just over 100%.
All right.
Heres the deal.
I will have no other resources in the area, and were obviously on the clock.
I need your team to pull a double.
Sir?
At this time, I have no authorization... for an extra team or air support... without confirmation, except for an extraction.
Okay.
Maybe I wasnt clear about the yellowcake.
Its the uranium type.
Uraniums legally mined in that region... and there are about 10 international agencies... counting every ounce of yellowcake produced... making damn sure what your intel says is happening never happens.
So you can imagine the kind of politics that we-
Listen, Case.
The guys in D.C. Cried wolf about this African yellowcake once before.
We both know how that turned out.
- Yes, I do.
- Listen.
I need you standing on top of that shit, smoking gun in hand... before any of this is on the record.
Now, your mission is to confirm that mine is producing uranium... stop the sale and expose the buyer... and you gotta do it with what you showed up with.
You got better intel this time, right?
Thatll be a giant pain in the ass, sir.
I know.
Consider it done.
Copy.
Youre fighting a war.
This aint a goddamn game.
I got deja vu.
Thats a bag of dicks, chief.
Sounds fubar.
I second your fubar, and I raise you a fugly.
- Yeah.
- Hey.
- If it dont suck-
- We dont do it.
What else can you tell me about the mine?
III tell you on the way.
Im going with you.
No, I dont think so.
Im the only one who knows this area and where Tongas troops are.
You need me.
Daccord?
- Sir?
- Yeah.
- Case on the line.
- Thanks.
Listen.
The CIA wants their money.
Just bury it with a GPS tracker.
Theyll get it later.
Copy.
Your sat phone is our only eyes and ears now.
- No more direct contact with the comms.
- Roger that.
Good luck.
- Collins.
- Sir.
Lose this.
Were sending smoke signals.
No pressure.
We gotta bury the money.
- CIA?
- Yup.
Just the dollars then.
- Bubba.
- Sir!
You gotta dig a hole, bury all the US currency.
And put a tracker on it.
Sir.
So were here.
Theres about 25 klicks between us and the mine.
This is the road.
Its heavily patrolled with Tongas soldiers.
Even with Tonga dead, Malin will have another general take over operations.
So we go around.
The terrain is very difficult.
It would take us days.
Nothing new there.
Tell me what you know about him.
Very little, unfortunately.
We dont know if hes one person or a network.
But hes controlled the illegal arms trade in Congo for years.
Now hes moved on to brokering uranium.
No one knows his real name.
- Malin is French.
- For sly, like a fox.
Yeah.
- Bubba.
- Sir.
We got two days of rations and water left.
Ordnance is the issue though.
Rounds are down to 40%.
Hey, lady.
Here.
Take it.
Ever used one of these?
III take that as a yes.
Lets do it.
We need to follow this river up east to get to the first pass.
Lets take the boat.
Well take it quietly.
Hostile, 3:00.
Start her up, Bubba.
They are stealing the boat!
They are stealing the boat!
- Here they come.
- Cover fire!
Cover fire!
Go!
Go!
Dan, right flank!
Right flank!
More hostiles, 9:00.
Incoming.
Get down!
Watch out, Bubba!
Turn around.
We gotta get Bubba.
Over here, guys.
Over here!
- Guys.
Pick me up!
- Come on.
We can make it.
Bubba!
Bubba, hold your hand out.
Bubba, give me your hand.
Come on.
Pull him up.
Pull him up.
Come on.
Move.
Faster.
Faster.
Fuck!
Its a dead end.
Turn left.
Turn left!
Dan, Vic!
Right flank!
We gotta hit the water.
Ah, fuck!
Case, look out!
The boat!
The boat!
Case, the boat!
Get out!
- Case!
- Look out!
Case!
Keep moving.
Dont stop!
Dont stop!
Lets go.
Come on.
Go, go, go!
III cover you.
Go!
Dan!
Dan!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
They fragged Dan, man.
Jesus Christ!
Hes all over the fucking place!
Follow the river.
Follow the river.
- We gotta go.
- I was supposed to watch him!
Keep it tight.
Its not your fault, all right?
Theres nothing you could have done.
Now we need you, buddy.
Okay?
So lets go.
Lets go.
Come on.
Lets go.
Fuck!
Confirmed.
The link is no longer active.
- We should assume the worst.
- No, we shouldnt.
Request satellite imaging on that coordinate... five minutes on either side of the signal fail.
Fuck!
Weve lost comms.
Dan had the fucking sat phone.
- We need to set up the 4MC.
- Comms?
Weve lost comms?
What the fuck about the man we just lost?
Vic!
Two, six, 10.
Shut your fucking cockhole, Bubba.
You all right, Bubs?
Lets take a look at this.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
You?
Yeah.
Here.
Okay?
Okay.
Its not your first time being shot, huh?
Its probably not my last.
I hope it is.
- Tell me if it hurts.
- Its fine.
Lets just fix that.
Under here.
Should do it.
Okay?
- Thank you.
- All right.
- Here.
- Thats good.
What?
Youre dangerous.
You know that?
You have no idea.
Sir, we got some smoke up ahead.
Lets check it out.
- What the fuck happened here?
- Tonga happened.
Its flamethrower accelerant.
I guess from that same batch of goodies those vz. 58s came from.
Jesus.
Why would Tonga do this?
These people are no threat to him.
They chose the wrong side.
Throw a dart round here and you hit a different rebel faction.
What side is the wrong side?
Any side but Tongas.
- Whats he saying?
- Saying Die, devil, die.
Were not here to hurt you.
Were here to help.
All right?
Hey, kid.
Hey, kid.
Kid.
Kid.
Look.
All right?
Jay.
Put that down.
Just trying to protect whats left of his village.
Hey, kid.
Kid, come here.
Look.
Shake my hand.
Come on.
Come on.
Put that down.
Shake my hand.
Hey.
Hey.
You all right?
For the last week, the villagers saw a convoy of trucks... coming through the pass every morning about an hour after sunup.
- Convoy comes every day?
- Every day.
Youre thinking about hitching a ride?
Fighting isnt the only thing were good at.
Hey, Bubba.
- Sir.
- Come here.
All right.
I got good news and really good news.
Good news is you boys have exactly one hour to cop some Zs.
Think of it as a mini vacation.
And the really good news?
Then were gonna breach a moving convoy...
loaded with Tongas troops.
- Youre welcome.
- Goddamn.
Damn.
Thats real good news.
Hes due.
Fuck him.
Im due.
Know what Dan would have said.
All right.
I better help the new guy with the truck.
- Hell probably fuck it up.
- Fucking will.
Howd you learn to shoot like that?
When I was 12, I pretended I was a boy and joined the army in Kinshasa.
It was during the civil war, so there was no training, no physicals- nothing.
They just took you straight to the battlefield with your own clothes.
When they discovered I was a girl I was already leading a unit... so they kept me.
No.
I dont buy it.
What?
Why?
Its hard to believe you could ever have been mistaken for a boy.
So you said fighting wasnt the only thing you were good at?
It isnt.
Come here.
- So whats the MO, sir?
- Give me a minute.
Just trying to put all the pieces together.
Thinking we do the Korengal Valley thing.
- Which one?
- First one.
I remember.
That got fucked up, right?
Yeah, but it was a better plan.
And I dont see any goat herders around here, do you?
All right.
First one it is.
So what are we doing?
How complicated is this?
Extremely.
Look.
- The truck stops there, right?
- Uh-huh.
We get on.
Okay.
Get down.
You, you, you!
Go, go, go!
Now!
- Go.
Go.
- Get in there.
Get in there.
Quick.
Get on the floor.
Get on the ground.
Okay.
Everyone in position.
One, two, three.
Lets go.
We need to assume... some of the operators are still viable.
Rescue protocol should give me at least one robot- start clearing some of the bad guys out of the area... give who is ever left out there... some sort of sporting chance.
- Yes, sir.
Im on it.
- Thank you, Collins.
Never assume the worst, Parker.
- Never.
- Sir.
Even if it is true.
Im the new general in charge here, so hurry up.
Move it.
Move it.
Faster, faster.
Faster, faster.
Faster, faster.
Faster, faster.
How long do we have until this rat trap stops?
Forty-five minutes, an hour at the most.
Carb up, fellas.
There might be some drama in the second half.
Sir, I think we got something here.
Farsi.
Those markings.
Takavar.
Iranian special forces.
Maybe we got the buyer.
Id imagine were looking at their good-faith deposit.
Comms.
Jackpot.
Looks like it might be a good day after all.
Bubba, get your ass over here.
Stop fiddling.
If we can get hold of CENTCOM... and let them know that were mission forward... they might not flatten the place before we get there.
- Hows your Persian, bro?
- Fuckin awesome.
If it was backwards.
Dont worry, cause all you have to do is find a satcom frequency... and we can tap into our own mission channel.
Ticktock.
Come on.
California, please take out all enemy hostiles.
Did that person sound like-
Four klicks to target.
Weapons are hot.
Shit.
Theyre taking out the mines.
Without confirming the intel, itll be next to impossible to get that approved.
How long have we been off-line?
Eight hours and change.
Ricks has probably initiated rescue measures.
But without visual confirmation or a request from us... he cannot send another team.
Hell be looking for the most visible concentration of enemy hostiles.
Get the low-hanging fruit first.
He could put a bird in the air, clear out the hostiles from the rescue perimeter... assuming were still operational.
So cavalrys gonna take care of some bad guys for us.
Good.
We in the convoy full of bad guys, numbnuts.
Put your helmet on, Bubba.
People, we have about 30 seconds to un-fuck ourselves.
- What are we gonna do?
- River, 20 seconds.
Hey, dont you think we should confirm strike?
Confirmed!
- Its a hit.
- Confirmed hit.
Everyone out!
- Go in for a second sweep.
- Copy that.
Incoming!
- Move out.
On me!
- Go, go, go!
Bubba!
Bubba, get out!
- Its a hit.
- Roger that.
Confirmed hit.
What the?
Those are our guys.
- California, abort mission!
Abort!
- Shit!
Goddamn it!
We got a goddamn situation here!
Come on, Bubs.
I got you.
Stay with me, man.
Stay with me.
Come on.
Come on.
- Get down here!
- Cover me.
Im going in.
Help me get him out.
Help me get him out.
Hes still breathing.
- I got him.
- We got you, Bubs.
One, two, three.
- Get his hand grenades.
- Pull his vest off.
All right.
Gun over.
Watch his face.
Gun over.
- We gotta stop the bleeding.
- Over his face.
- Open him up.
- Vic!
Jam as much of that in the wound as possible.
- Gauze.
- Easy, Bubs.
Easy.
Easy.
Youre okay.
Easy.
Easy.
Youre all right, buddy.
Look at me.
Look at me.
Youre all right.
Bubba, look at me.
Just breathe.
Take it easy.
Just keep breathing.
Does this hole qualify me for the good shit, sir?
Close enough.
Youre all right.
Its okay, kid.
- Lets tie this off.
- Lets get that shirt off.
Come on.
Up you go, Bubs.
- Get him on his feet.
- There you go.
Getting some color back.
Youre blushing.
- Here you go.
- Just tie it off.
All right.
On three.
One, two, three.
Hey.
All right, look at me.
- Are you doing good?
- Sir.
Sorry about the truck, sir.
Dont mention it.
Come on.
- You all right?
- Yes, sir.
- You good?
- Yeah.
- How much further?
- A couple of hours.
Hey, what was in that syringe?
A little of everything, I expect.
Collins, confirm the head count.
I still show five.
Okay, we lost one of our boys.
But I dont think, for the record... we can positively ID the individuals on the ground as our own.
- But, sir, I think its clear-
- Since we cannot make a positive ID... this remains an official search-and-rescue operation... and we can therefore keep our bird on scene.
So in case those happen to be our boys... we should let them know we have eyes on them.
California, this is Gray Base One.
Please stand by for orders.
Gray Base One, California standing by.
Again?
Seriously?
These guys dont fight from 200 feet.
If theyre down this low, its to say, Hey, we know youre up and running.
- Mind if I do the honors?
- Be my guest.
I believe we have confirmation our team understands eyes are back on.
You think, Parker?
All right.
Lets get California back up top.
Eyes only until they need us.
- California, pull back.
- Gray Base One, California will comply.
Were almost there.
The mines are just on the other side of this pass.
Were clear.
Okay, close the gate.
Lets go.
Victor.
See the mine shaft?
Two guard detachments, both sheltered.
Guards are staying put.
So any satellite images will show this place is still inactive.
Which means Malins hideout will be underground.
A foxhole.
Definitely.
The few things weve learned about Malin... have always been the opposite of what we assumed.
Collins, lets get up close and personal in case they need the support.
Yes, sir.
California, this is Gray Base One.
Please adjust to an 8K ceiling for max visual and pending support.
Gray Base One, California will comply.
Repeat.
Will comply.
So whats the plan?
Kamikaze with a twist?
I got you.
Kamikaze... with a twist?
Youre gonna love this one.
- Hey, whos that?
- Watch out.
Nobodys in the truck.
Go, go, go.
- Another fuckin.50-cal.
- Grenade!
Dont stop.
Keep moving.
Keep moving.
- Bubba!
- Grenade!
Lets go!

- What you got?
Map.
You guys take the main entrance.
Ill take the elevator.
Well meet in the middle.
Fuckin maverick.
I got you.
All right.
On me.
We aint here to hurt you.
- Theyre just miners.
- All right.
Stack up.
Boys ready to go down the rabbit hole?
Thats why we came, right?
Goddamn it.
On your 6:00, Case.
On your 6:00.
- This has to be the spot.
- Yeah.
- These guys seem pretty motivated.
- Guarding the kings quarters.
Jay, me and you take the right flank.
The rest of you-
Bubba, on me.
- Bubba, go.
- Sir.
Get down!
- Goddamn it.
- B!
- Bubba, you all right?
- III check if its over here.
Zoe, wait.
Stay together.
Goddamn it.
Hey, B. Bubs.
Vic, were on your 6:00.
- What happened?
- A knife.
- You okay?
Wheres Zoe?
- Went that way.
Well take that section, find her.
- Look after Bubs.
- Go.
Ive got him.
Hey.
Hey, B. Bubs, hang in there, kid.
Malin better be still alive.
Motherfucker!
Who betrayed me?
Who, mother cocksucker?
Youve gotta be shitting me.
Tail pipe, now.
Shit!
- You got a missile lock.
- I know.
- All right.
Evasive action.
- Countermeasure engaged.
California, Gray Base One.
We seem to have lost our feed.
Please advise.
You two, go to the safe house.
Set up a meeting.
What the hells going on?
Get Commander Ricks on the line right now.
Yes, maam.
You two, come with me.
Yall think that Zoe chicks gonna be all right?
Havent you been paying attention?
This lady knows exactly what shes doing.
Left.
Got an office down here?
Im gonna do a sweep.
- Be back in two minutes.
- All right.
Sweep done, man.
All clear.
No sign of Zoe.
No sign of guards.
No sign of nothing.
- I just e-mailed CENTCOM.
- E-mail?
Yeah, no landline.
Malins network.
The best I could do.
Commander, you need to see this.
Youre not gonna believe it... but a message from the team was just routed to us from Little Creek.
- What?
- They sent an e-mail... to their home base, requesting immediate medevac.
An e-mail?
Thats brilliant.
Collins, we need the helicopter.
I need field medics on standby.
We got a SEAL down.
I repeat.
We got a SEAL down.
Make it happen, goddamn it.
Figure it out.
Where is this Malin anyway, the yellowcake?
I dont know.
Soldiers for hire dont fight like that to protect an empty nest.
Malins here.
Im sure of it.
- Were missing something.
- Yeah, like?
So Malin pays Tonga to secure the area... so he can quietly stockpile yellowcake for a huge sale.
But theres a problem when you pay an army for protection.
Yeah, like whos gonna protect you from the army?
Exactly.
So Tonga realizes that the shit hes paid to protect... is worth more than hes being paid to protect it.
He becomes a threat.
Malin has no way of taking him out.
It turns out he dont need to.
We do it for him.
Who pushed over the first domino?
We took out Tongas camp based on intel from the local asset...
Zoe Jelani.
She got caught on purpose.
No, she didnt.
That was her one mistake.
Think about it.
Shes a proven local asset doing what?
Ratting out her competition.
So shes got a perfect record... because all she has to do is point to Tongas training camp... and scream Al-Qaeda and we just vaporize it.
Yep.
And physical confirmation is needed now.
And she gets caught somehow... by Tonga... the one person that can ID her.
He was about to tell us exactly who she was.
So she offs him.
And we buy it.
Why wouldnt we?
Im sure he did torture her.
Then she tells us about the yellowcake... convinces us to walk her through the gauntlet... so she doesnt miss her sale.
We still alive, right?
You do know how to pick em, Case.
- Lets go get her.
- Damn straight.
Run, run.
Why cant you like nice women, Case?
Vic, Bubba!
Vic, Bubba!
Get outta here!
Now!
What the fucks going on?
Whats all the noise?
No, no, no.
Bubba, Vic.
- Case.
- We gotta get them out.
Case, we gotta go.
Case, we gotta go, man.
Case, we gotta go.
We gotta go!
- Move it.
- Right.
We should go now.
Lets go.
Fuck!
Turn around.
- Fuck.
- Shit.
Come on, faster.
Kill them.
Jay!
Fuck, hes still alive.
Grab him.
We will use him.
- What about the other one?
- Hes as good as dead.
Jay!
- Just you?
- Get us out of here, fast.
- You got comms with Ricks?
- Delta channel.
Ricks, Case on delta channel.
- Come in.
Do you read?
- Go for Ricks.
Vic and Bubba didnt make it.
So you have three seals down there that need to come home.
And Ricks... they got Jay.
- What do you mean, they got Jay?
- Malin has him.
- How the fuck did that happen?
- The fuckin asset is Malin.
What the fuck you want from me anyway?
You fuckin missing Case?
- III ask the questions.
- Fuckin bitch.
What the fuck do you think I know that can help you?
Nothing.
Kinshasa is ground zero for Malins smuggling pipeline.
She probably has a distribution point... where she can ship out small, untraceable loads.
And now we know every bit of intel the CIA has on Malin... was planted by Malin.
Okay, Case, we got three dead SEALs.
And now they got a live SEAL as a bonus.
Why the fuck are you torturing me?
Come on.
Im not torturing you.
Im giving you a taste of what your new life will be like in Iran.
We know she operates from the slums.
Im guessing the intel she was pushing never pointed there.
Hes right.
Can you think of a better place to set up shop?
The cops wont go near it.
Its like another planet in there with mob rule.
Fuckin bitch.
You might want to show a little respect.
Shes protected in there.
All these warlords treat their territory the same.
Like a tribal kingdom.
We saw it in Mog back in 06.
Find me the tallest building in the slums or directly adjacent.
She may or may not be there... but even money says she controls it.
Lets do it.
Do it.
We got an apartment complex.
Nsele Tower.
Its the tallest structure in the area.
- Its right on the perimeter.
- What do you think?
Lts a place to start, and lm scrambling a team to recon with you.
- How long?
- Two and a half hours, on the inside.
Thats too long.
The window might be closed by then.
Im gonna drop in solo.
I dont want you dropping in with nothing but your dick in your hand.
- I appreciate it.
- Here.
Take my cell phone.
Now lm just gonna do lead recon.
I wont shake the tree until the cavalry gets there.
No.
Case, I dont like it.
Come on, Ricks.
Were probably wrong anyway.
At least I can start eliminating possible locations, narrow the options.
Hello?
Excuse me.
Can I borrow these?
Hello?
Excuse me.
Can I borrow these?
Okay, Case, listen to me.
Keep your head down and your mouth shut.
Im done losing men today.
Me too.
Fuck me.
Ricks, got a visual on the van.
- Case, talk to me.
- Hold on, III take a closer look.
Empty.
Wait.
I hear something.
Ill get back to you.
I got Case again for you.
Hey, Ricks.
I think I got something for you.
Trace that voice.
Get that?
Got it.
Weve confirmed the buyer is an Iranian operative named Amjad... with ties to the terrorist cell Al-Shabaab.
Amjad will probably take the final shipment of the uranium... but we suspect the final payment will be at Malins safe house... where she is most likely holding Jay.
- Location?
- Near the old market.
Working the sat right now.
But if she hasnt broken up the payload... there should be enough to nail down the uranium signature.
Case, just observe.
Bravo is close.
Theyre 20 klicks out.
I gotta keep moving.
Hell lead me to Malin.
Im not losing Jay.
Case?
Hes gonna do it.
Hes gotta.
Over there.
There he is.
- This way, everybody.
- Go, go, go.
- Go, go, go.
- Come on, you assholes!
Grenade!
Get back!
Get back!
Oh, you wanna play kamikaze?
Lets play kamikaze.
Get back!
Get back!
Grenade.
Shit.
Guess who.
Fire!
Thanks, Jay.
- Hello.
- Youre late.
Navy SEAL, motherfucker.
There are two more detachments coming to get me out of here.
You and your friend are standing in your own grave.
How many villages are dying of radiation poisoning... from work in your mine?
What do you think thats like?
I cant even imagine.
You wont have to.
Do it.
Do it.
Come on.
Do it.
You Americans are so weak.
Without your drones and missiles, youd be nothing.
Even if you kill me, another will take my place... probably hired with the same money.
Helping people like Tonga... sacrificing innocent people... sacrificing my friends.
It has to stop.
Well, stop this.
Oh, God.
You motherfucker!
No, dont go away!
Help me!
Help me!
That is a whole lot of nuke juice.
Enough to get you in the superpower club.
Comfortable, Commander?
You realize that everybody around you is wearing a hazmat suit, right?
Were immune to nukes.
So how about a ride out of this shit hole?
Half a klick away.
I want you two to take some R and R, gentlemen.
And I want you to make it count.
- Thanks, Chief.
- Chief.
Where should we go?
- Jay, shift your weight.
- Shut up, old man.
This aint E and E, its R and R for me.
You know...
- I havent thanked you yet.
- For what?
Your excellent work in picking a vacation spot.
Come on, man.

Yes, I do.

You are a lucky motherfucker, Case.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I got the same amount of luck as the next guy.
Just time mine better.
You're an asshole.
It's your fault.
You taught him how to play the game back in Beirut.
Sir.

- Jay.

- Commander.
(JAY) You here for a game?
I already owe you too much.
Come on, Chief.
Double or nothing.
I thought you didn't take I.O.U.'s.
I don't give you I.O.U.'s.
Hey.
Where's the rest of the team?
Well, the smooth dogs are working on some frog hogs... and new guy's over there soaking up some Steinbeck.
Let's go.

You're about to get your cherry popped in Africa, son.
How you feel about that?

Let's go.
(CASE) So what's got everyone hot and bothered, Chief?
(PARKER) We got some bad guys we need you to take care of.
And a couple of good guys we'd like back.
Now, one of the Agency's local assets in Congo... uncovered a covert military training camp... with a distinct Al-Qaeda signature.
Got a pad, new guy?
Take notes.
The asset and her C.I.A. handler... attempted physical confirmation... but were captured in the process.
(PARKER) We believe these camps engage in significant arms dealing as well.
(RICKS) I'd just as soon flatten this place from 10,000 feet... but there's a strong probability that they have our agent and his asset.
Now, the asset is a local informant...
Zoe Jelani.
French-African.
Born in Marrakech, Morocco.
Lives in Kinshasa, Congo.
She's smart, and she's a survivor.
Her C.I.A. handler is Tom Seborn.
He recruited her, and she quickly became his most valuable source with HUMINT.
Now, actionable intel from Jelani... resulted in the takedown of several major smuggling kingpins except one.
We know he goes by the name Malin.
But that's all we know.
We have no photos, no description.
This guy's invisible and a growing threat.
- We believe he's supplying this camp with weapons.
- (NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)
Now, the leader of this camp is this man...
General Japhet Tonga.
A major rebel, figure in the civil war wanted for war crimes, genocide and all that other Anderson Cooper bullshit.
He's a major asshole.
- What's his affiliation with Al-Qaeda?
- We're not sure.
But he understands that zealotry plus money equals power, and that's his god.
We are gonna quickly and not so quietly take it apart for him.
I like dealing with you.
You always deliver.
Yeah.
I want you to bring me more people from abroad...

Reaper will clear the perimeter and provide cover fire as needed.
You will locate and extract our people or confirm that they are dead or off-site, at which point, you will exfiltrate... and our bot will render the camp inoperable.

(LAUGHS) I'll tell you this.
She is...
Move back!
Move back!
Sit in the chair!
Sit in the chair!
(JAY) Damn.
Shit.
Shit.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Oui.
They're gonna want to spend a couple of weeks at least debriefing you somewhere safe.
Out of the country, all right?
Chief, I...
What the fuck?
Dan, what is it?
Uh, I think we got something.
Excuse me.
Vic.
Let's go.
(JAY) I don't know what you did to her, but let's just say you got served.
Reinforced door.
Be ready for anything, gentlemen.
Copy that.
Popping the lock.
- When you're ready, call it.
- Sir.
Blow the lock in three.
(BEEPS)
Clear.
(WHISTLES)
That's some serious fuck-you money.
It's a good thing we're not in this for the money.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, good thing.
(CASE) Now why would the general here have all this cash on hand?
Sir.
Those are troop designations.
It's got every entry point covered.
Whatever that is, he's guarding it like Fort Knox.
It's a mine, and he's been paid a lot of money to make sure no one knows it exists.
Question is, what's he pulling out?
Only two things come out of the ground in this region...
Copper... and uranium.
I discovered this place while tracking an illegal arms dealer.
Malin.
That's right.
We knew Tonga was receiving weapons, but what we didn't know is that he wasn't buying them.
- They were payment for his services.
- He's working with Malin.
- Shit.
- He's working for Malin... who's been stockpiling yellowcake uranium for a major sale.
(BUBBA) Sir.
According to this, there's been a major influx of activity around the mine.
- Then I guess the sale's happening soon.
- Thirty-six hours.
And how would you know that exactly?
Tonga.
Sure.
Let's go.
You're bullshitting me.
We gotta keep going.
We've a patch-through.
Case.
I'm sitting here with the C.I.A.
How solid is your intel on the mine and this yellowcake sale?
Just over 100%.
All right.
Here's the deal.
I will have no other resources in the area, and we're obviously on the clock.
I need your team to pull a double.
- Sir?
- At this time,
I have no authorization... for an extra team or air support without confirmation, except for an extraction.
Okay.
Maybe I wasn't clear about the yellowcake.
It's the uranium type.
Uranium's legally mined in that region... and there are about 10 international agencies... counting every ounce of yellowcake produced... making damn sure what your intel says is happening never happens.
So you can imagine the kind of politics that we...
Listen, Case.
The guys in D.C. cried wolf about this African yellowcake once before.
We both know how that turned out.
Yes, I do.
Listen.
I need you standing on top of that shit... smoking gun in hand, before any of this is on the record.
Now, your mission is to confirm that mine is producing uranium... stop the sale and expose the buyer... and you gotta do it with what you showed up with.
You got better intel this time, right?
That'll be a giant pain in the ass, sir.
I know.
Consider it done.
Copy.
You're fighting a war.
This ain't a goddamn game.
I got deja vu.
That's a bag of dicks, chief.
Sounds fubar.
I second your fubar, and I raise you a fugly.
Hooyah.
Hey.
- If it don't suck...
- (ALL) We don't do it.
What else can you tell me about the mine?
I'll tell you on the way.
I'm going with you.
No, I don't think so.
I'm the only one who knows this area and where Tonga's troops are.
You need me.
D'accord?
Sir?
Yeah.
Case on the line.
Thanks.
Listen.
The C.I.A. wants their money.
Just bury it with a G.P.S. tracker.
They'll get it later.
Copy.
Your sat phone is our only eyes and ears now.
No more direct contact with the comms.
Roger that.
Good luck.

No pressure.
We gotta bury the money.
- C.I.A.?
- Yup.
Just the dollars then.
- Bubba.
- Sir!
You gotta dig a hole, bury all the US currency.
And put a tracker on it.
Sir.
So we're here.
There's about 25 klicks between us and the mine.
This is the road.
It's heavily patrolled with Tonga's soldiers.
Even with Tonga dead, Malin will have another general take over operations.
So we go around.
The terrain is very difficult.
It would take us days.
Nothing new there.
Tell me what you know about him.
Very little, unfortunately.
We don't know if he's one person or a network.
But he's controlled the illegal arms trade in Congo for years.
Now he's moved on to brokering uranium.
No one knows his real name.
Malin is French.
For "sly," like a fox.
Yeah.
(JAY) Bubba.

So Malin pays Tonga to secure the area... so he can quietly stockpile yellowcake for a huge sale.
But there's a problem when you pay an army for protection.
Yeah, like who's gonna protect you from the army?
Exactly.

Malin has no way of taking him out.

I got Case again for you.
(CASE) Hey, Ricks.
I think I got something for you.
(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
(MAN SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
Trace that voice.
Get that?
Got it.
We've confirmed the buyer is an Iranian operative named Amjad... with ties to the terrorist cell Al-Shabaab.
Amjad will probably take the final shipment of the uranium... but we suspect the final payment will be at Malin's safe house... where she is most likely holding Jay.
- Location?
- Near the old market.
Working the sat right now.
But if she hasn't broken up the payload... there should be enough to nail down the uranium signature.
Case, just observe.
Bravo is close.
They're 20 klicks out.
I gotta keep moving.
He'll lead me to Malin.
I'm not losing Jay.

Today, I want you to know something...
That the general loves you.
But there are some of you here...
I want to show you today... what happens when you choose the wrong side... when you betray Tonga.
Bring me his wife.
I want to show you what happens when you don't listen.
- No.
- Like this man here.
This is how a genius plays.
I'm like Jordan on the pool table, understand?

It's cool.
You know I don't do I.O.U.'s, right?
Better have double that stack in your pocket, or we're gonna have ourselves a situation.
You are a lucky motherfucker, Case.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I got the same amount of luck as the next guy.
Just time mine better.
You're an asshole.
It's your fault.
You taught him how to play the game back in Beirut.
Sir.

You here for a game?

I'm sure these fine ladies are happy to hear it.
Get your dicks.
You haven't killed anybody yet, you prick.
Let's go.
So what's got everyone hot and bothered, Chief?
We got some bad guys we need you to take care of.
And a couple of good guys we'd like back.
Now, one of the Agency's local assets in Congo... uncovered a covert military training camp... with a distinct Al-Qaeda signature.
Got a pad, new guy?
Take notes.
The asset and her C.I.A. handler... attempted physical confirmation... but were captured in the process.
We believe these camps engage in significant arms dealing as well.
I'd just as soon flatten this place from 10,000 feet... but there's a strong probability that they have our agent and his asset.
Now, the asset is a local informant...
Zoe Jelani.
French-African.
Born in Marrakech, Morocco.
Lives in Kinshasa, Congo.
She's smart, and she's a survivor.
Her C.I.A. handler is Tom Seborn.
He recruited her, and she quickly became his most valuable source with HUMINT.
Now, actionable intel from Jelani... resulted in the takedown of several major smuggling kingpins except one.
We know he goes by the name Malin.
But that's all we know.
We have no photos, no description.
This guy's invisible and a growing threat.
We believe he's supplying this camp with weapons.
Now, the leader of this camp is this man...
General Japhet Tonga.
A major rebel, figure in the civil war wanted for war crimes, genocide and all that other Anderson Cooper bullshit.
He's a major asshole.
- What's his affiliation with Al-Qaeda?
- We're not sure.
But he understands that zealotry plus money equals power, and that's his god.
We are gonna quickly and not so quietly take it apart for him.
I like dealing with you.
You always deliver.
Yeah.
I want you to bring me more people from abroad...
I can do business with.
I can do it.
No problem.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Your team will execute an insertion... 15 klicks from the target area at exactly 0200 hours.
We have a pilot with a commercial chopper and local knowledge.

You will have U.A.V. support.
Reaper will clear the perimeter and provide cover fire as needed.
You will locate and extract our people or confirm that they are dead or off-site, at which point, you will exfiltrate... and our bot will render the camp inoperable.

Chief, I...
What the fuck?
Dan, what is it?
Uh, I think we got something.
Excuse me.
Vic.
Let's go.
I don't know what you did to her, but let's just say you got served.
Reinforced door.
Be ready for anything, gentlemen.
Copy that.
Popping the lock.
- When you're ready, call it.
- Sir.
Blow the lock in three.
Clear.
That's some serious fuck-you money.
It's a good thing we're not in this for the money.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, good thing.
Now why would the general here have all this cash on hand?
Sir.
Those are troop designations.
It's got every entry point covered.
Whatever that is, he's guarding it like Fort Knox.
It's a mine, and he's been paid a lot of money to make sure no one knows it exists.
Question is, what's he pulling out?
Only two things come out of the ground in this region...
Copper... and uranium.
I discovered this place while tracking an illegal arms dealer.
Malin.
That's right.
We knew Tonga was receiving weapons, but what we didn't know is that he wasn't buying them.
- They were payment for his services.
- He's working with Malin.
- Shit.
- He's working for Malin... who's been stockpiling yellowcake uranium for a major sale.
Sir.
According to this, there's been a major influx of activity around the mine.
- Then I guess the sale's happening soon.
- Thirty-six hours.
And how would you know that exactly?
Tonga.
Sure.
Let's go.
You're bullshitting me.
We gotta keep going.
We've a patch-through.
Case.
I'm sitting here with the C.I.A.
How solid is your intel on the mine and this yellowcake sale?
Just over 100%.
All right.
Here's the deal.
I will have no other resources in the area, and we're obviously on the clock.
I need your team to pull a double.
- Sir?
- At this time,
I have no authorization... for an extra team or air support without confirmation, except for an extraction.
Okay.
Maybe I wasn't clear about the yellowcake.
It's the uranium type.
Uranium's legally mined in that region... and there are about 10 international agencies... counting every ounce of yellowcake produced... making damn sure what your intel says is happening never happens.
So you can imagine the kind of politics that we...
Listen, Case.
The guys in D.C. cried wolf about this African yellowcake once before.
We both know how that turned out.
Yes, I do.
Listen.
I need you standing on top of that shit... smoking gun in hand, before any of this is on the record.
Now, your mission is to confirm that mine is producing uranium... stop the sale and expose the buyer... and you gotta do it with what you showed up with.
You got better intel this time, right?
That'll be a giant pain in the ass, sir.
I know.
Consider it done.
Copy.
You're fighting a war.
This ain't a goddamn game.
I got deja vu.
That's a bag of dicks, chief.
Sounds fubar.
I second your fubar, and I raise you a fugly.
Hooyah.
Hey.
- If it don't suck...
- We don't do it.
What else can you tell me about the mine?
I'll tell you on the way.
I'm going with you.
No, I don't think so.
I'm the only one who knows this area and where Tonga's troops are.
You need me.
D'accord?
Sir?
Yeah.
Case on the line.
Thanks.
Listen.
The C.I.A. wants their money.
Just bury it with a G.P.S. tracker.
They'll get it later.
Copy.
Your sat phone is our only eyes and ears now.
No more direct contact with the comms.
Roger that.
Good luck.
- Collins.
- Sir.
Lose this and we're sending smoke signals.
No pressure.
We gotta bury the money.
- C.I.A.?
- Yup.
Just the dollars then.
- Bubba.
- Sir!
You gotta dig a hole, bury all the US currency.
And put a tracker on it.
Sir.
So we're here.
There's about 25 klicks between us and the mine.
This is the road.
It's heavily patrolled with Tonga's soldiers.
Even with Tonga dead, Malin will have another general take over operations.
So we go around.
The terrain is very difficult.
It would take us days.
Nothing new there.
Tell me what you know about him.
Very little, unfortunately.
We don't know if he's one person or a network.
But he's controlled the illegal arms trade in Congo for years.
Now he's moved on to brokering uranium.
No one knows his real name.
Malin is French.
For "sly," like a fox.
Yeah.
Bubbam Sir.
We got two days of rations and water left.
Ordnance is the issue though.
Rounds are down to 40%.
Hey, lady.
Here.
Take it.
Ever used one of these?
I'll take that as a yes.
Let's do it.
We need to follow this river up east to get to the first pass.
Let's take the boat.
We'll take it quietly.

Bubba, give me your hand.

Keep it tight.
It's not your fault, all right?
There's nothing you could have done.
Now we need you, buddy.
Okay?
So let's go.
Let's go.
Come on.
Let's go.
Fuck!

The link is no longer active.
We should assume the worst.
No, we shouldn't.
Request satellite imaging on that coordinate... five minutes on either side of the signal fail.
Fuck!

We need to set up the 4-M.C. Comms?
We've lost comms?

Let's take a look at this.
You all right?
Yeah.
You?
Yeah.

Okay?
Okay.
It's not your first time being shot, huh?
It's probably not my last.
I hope it is.
Tell me if it hurts.
It's fine.
Let's just fix that.
Under here.
Mmm.
Should do it.
Okay?
Thank you.
All right.
Here.
That's good.
What?
You're dangerous.
You know that?
You have no idea.
Sir, we got some smoke up ahead.
Let's check it out.
- What the fuck happened here?
- Tonga happened.
It's flamethrower accelerant.
I guess from that same batch of goodies those vz. 58s came from.
Jesus.
Why would Tonga do this?
These people are no threat to him.
They chose the wrong side.
Throw a dart round here and you hit a different rebel faction.
What side is the wrong side?
Any side but Tonga's.
- What's he saying?
- "Die, devil, die."
We're not here to hurt you.
We're here to help.
All right?
Hey, kid.
Hey, kid.
Kid.
Kid.
Look.
All right?
Jay.
Put that down.
Just trying to protect what's left of his village.
Hey, kid.
Kid, come here.
Look.
Shake my hand.
Come on.
Come on.
Put that down.
Shake my hand.
Hey.
Hey.
You all right?
For the last week, the villagers saw a convoy of trucks... coming through the pass every morning about an hour after sunup.
- Convoy comes every day?
- Every day.
You're thinking about hitching a ride?
Fighting isn't the only thing we're good at.
Hey, Bubba.
Sir.
Come here.
All right.
I got good news and really good news.
Good news is you boys have exactly one hour to cop some Z's.
Think of it as a mini vacation.
And the really good news?
Then we're gonna breach a moving convoy... loaded with Tonga's troops.
You're welcome.
Goddamn.
Damn.
That's real good news.
He's due.
Fuck him.
I'm due.
Know what Dan would have said.
All right.
I better help the new guy with the truck.
He'll probably fuck it up.
Fucking will.
How'd you learn to shoot like that?
When I was 12, I pretended I was a boy and joined the army in Kinshasa.
It was during the civil war, so there was no training, no physicals... nothing.
They just took you straight to the battlefield with your own clothes.
When they discovered I was a girl I was already leading a unit... so they kept me.
No.
I don't buy it.
What?
Why?
It's hard to believe you could ever have been mistaken for a boy.
So you said fighting wasn't the only thing you were good at?
It isn't.
Come here.
- So what's the M.O., sir?
- Give me a minute.
Just trying to put all the pieces together.
Thinking we do the Korengal Valley thing.
Which one?
First one.
I remember.
That got fucked up, right?
Yeah, but it was a better plan.
And I don't see any goat herders around here, do you?
All right.
First one it is.
So what are we doing?
How complicated is this?
Extremely.
Look.
- The truck stops there, right?
- Uh-huh.
We get on.
Okay.
Get down.
You, you, you!
Go, go, go!
Now!
- Go.
Go.
- Get in there.
Get in there.
Quick.
Get on the floor.
Get on the ground.
Okay.
Everyone in position.
One, two, three.
Let's go.
We need to assume... some of the operators are still viable.
Rescue protocol should give me at least one robot... start clearing some of the bad guys out of the area... give who is ever left out there... some sort of sporting chance.
Yes, sir.
I'm on it.
Thank you, Collins.
Never assume the worst, Parker.
Never.
Sir.
Even if it is true.
I'm the new general in charge here, so hurry up.
Move it.
Faster, faster.
Faster, faster.
Faster, faster.
How long do we have until this rat trap stops?
Forty-five minutes, an hour at the most.
Carb up, fellas.
There might be some drama in the second half.
Sir, I think we got something here.
Farsi.
Those markings.
Takavar.
Iranian special forces.
Maybe we got the buyer.
I'd imagine we're looking at their good-faith deposit.
Comms.
Jackpot.
Looks like it might be a good day after all.
Bubba, get your ass over here.
Stop fiddling'.
If we can get hold of CENTCOM... and let them know that we're mission forward... they might not flatten the place before we get there.
- How's your Persian, bro?
- Fuckin' awesome.
If it was backwards.
Don't worry, 'cause all you have to do is find a satcom frequency... and we can tap into our own mission channel.
Ticktock.
Come on.
California, please take out all enemy hostiles.
- Did that person sound like...
- Four klicks to target.
Weapons are hot.
Shit.
They're taking out the mines.
Without confirming the intel, it'll be next to impossible to get that approved.
How long have we been off-line?
Eight hours and change.
Ricks has probably initiated rescue measures.
But without visual confirmation or a request from us, he cannot send another team.
He'll be looking for the most visible concentration of enemy hostiles.
Get the low-hanging fruit first.
He could put a bird in the air, clear out the hostiles from the rescue perimeter... assuming we're still operational.
So cavalry's gonna take care of some bad guys for us.
Good.
We in the convoy full of bad guys, numbnuts.
Put your helmet on, Bubba.
People, we have about 30 seconds to un-fuck ourselves.
What are we gonna do?
River, 20 seconds.
Hey, don't you think we should confirm strike?
Confirmed!
- It's a hit.
- Confirmed hit.
Everyone out!
- Go in for a second sweep.
- Copy that.
Incoming!
- Move out.
On me!

He's still breathing.
I got him.
We got you, Bubs.
One, two, three.
- Get his hand grenades.
- Pull his vest off.
All right.
Gun over.
Watch his face.
Gun over.
- We gotta stop the bleeding.
- Over his face.
- Open him up.
- Vic!
- Jam as much of that in the wound as possible.
- Gauze.
Easy, Bubs.
Easy.
Easy.
You're okay.
Easy.
You're all right, buddy.
Look at me.
Look at me.
You're all right.
Bubba, look at me.
Just breathe.
Take it easy.
Just keep breathing.
Does this hole qualify me for the good shit, sir?
Close enough.
You're all right.
It's okay, kid.
Let's tie this off.
Let's get that shirt off.
Come on.
Up you go, Bubs.
- Get him on his feet.
- There you go.
Getting some color back.
You're blushing.
- Here you go.
- Just tie it off.
All right.
On three.
One, two, three.
Hey.
All right, look at me.
Are you doing good?
Sir.
Sorry about the truck, sir.
Don't mention it.
Come on.
You all right?
Yes, sir.
You good?
Yeah.
How much further?
A couple of hours.
Hey, what was in that syringe?
A little of everything, I expect.
Collins, confirm the head count.
I still show five.
Okay, we lost one of our boys.
But I don't think, for the record... we can positively I.D. the individuals on the ground as our own.
But, sir, I think it's clear...
Since we cannot make a positive ID... this remains an official search-and-rescue operation... and we can therefore keep our bird on scene.
So in case those happen to be our boys... we should let them know we have eyes on them.
California, this is Gray Base One.
Please stand by for orders.
Gray Base One, California standing by.
Again?
Seriously?
These guys don't fight from 200 feet.
If they're down this low, it's to say, "Hey, we know you're up and running."
Mind if I do the honors?
Be my guest.
I believe we have confirmation our team understands eyes are back on.
You think, Parker?
All right.
Let's get California back up top.
Eyes only until they need us.
- California, pull back.
- Gray Base One, California will comply.
We're almost there.
The mines are just on the other side of this pass.
We're clear.
Okay, close the gate.
Let's go.
Victor.
See the mine shaft?
Two guard detachments, both sheltered.
Guards are staying put.
So any satellite images will show this place is still inactive.
Which means Malin's hideout will be underground.
A foxhole.
Definitely.
The few things we've learned about Malin... have always been the opposite of what we assumed.
Collins, let's get up close and personal in case they need the support.
Yes, sir.
California, this is Gray Base One.
Please adjust to an 8K ceiling for max visual and pending support.
Gray Base One, California will comply.
Repeat.
Will comply.
So what's the plan?
Kamikaze with a twist?
I got you.
Kamikaze... with a twist?
You're gonna love this one.
Hey, who's that?
Watch out.
Nobody's in the truck.
Go, go, go.
- Another fuckin' .50-cal.
- Grenade!
Don't stop.
Keep moving.
Keep moving.
- Bubba!
- Grenade!
Let's go!
Move up!
Case.
What you got?
Map.
You guys take the main entrance.
I'll take the elevator.
We'll meet in the middle.
Fuckin' maverick.
I got you.
All right.
On me.
We ain't here to hurt you.
- They're just miners.
- All right.
Stack up.
Boys ready to go down the rabbit hole?
That's why we came, right?
Goddamn it.
On your 6:00, Case.
On your 6:00.
This has to be the spot.
Yeah.
These guys seem pretty motivated.
Guarding the king's quarters.
Jay, me and you take the right flank.
The rest of you...
Bubba, on me.
Bubba, go.
Sir.
Get down!
- Goddamn it.
- B!
Bubba, you all right?
I'll check if it's over here.
Zoe, wait.
Stay together.
Goddamn it.
Hey, B. Bubs.
Vic, we're on your 6:00.
- What happened?
- A knife.
- You okay?
Where's Zoe?
- Went that way.
We'll take that section, find her.
Look after Bubs.
Go.
I've got him.
Hey.
Hey, B. Bubs, hang in there, kid.
Malin better be still alive.
Motherfucker!
Who betrayed me?
Who, mother cocksucker?
You've gotta be shitting me.
Tail pipe, now.
Shit!
- You got a missile lock.
- I know.
- All right.
Evasive action.
- Countermeasure engaged.
California, Gray Base One.
We seem to have lost our feed.
Please advise.
You two, go to the safe house.
Set up a meeting.
What the hell's going on?
Get Commander Ricks on the line right now.
Yes, ma'am.
You two, come with me.
Y'all think that Zoe chick's gonna be all right?
Haven't you been paying attention?
This lady knows exactly what she's doing.
Left.
Got an office down here?
I'm gonna do a sweep.
Be back in two minutes.
All right.
Sweep done, man.
All clear.
No sign of Zoe.
No sign of guards.
No sign of nothing.
- I just e-mailed CENTCOM.
- E-mail?
Yeah, no landline.
Malin's network.
The best I could do.
Commander, you need to see this.
You're not gonna believe it... but a message from the team was just routed to us from Little Creek.
What?
They sent an e-mail to their home base... requesting immediate medevac.
An e-mail?
That's brilliant.
Collins, we need the helicopter.
I need field medics on standby.
We got a SEAL down.
I repeat.
We got a SEAL down.
Make it happen, goddamn it.
Figure it out.
Where is this Malin anyway, the yellowcake?
I don't know.
Soldiers for hire don't fight like that to protect an empty nest.
Malin's here.
I'm sure of it.
We're missing something.
Yeah, like?
So Malin pays Tonga to secure the area... so he can quietly stockpile yellowcake for a huge sale.
But there's a problem when you pay an army for protection.
Yeah, like who's gonna protect you from the army?
Exactly.
So Tonga realizes that the shit he's paid to protect... is worth more than he's being paid to protect it.
He becomes a threat.
Malin has no way of taking him out.
It turns out he don't need to.
We do it for him.
Who pushed over the first domino?
We took out Tonga's camp based on intel from the local asset...
Zoe Jelani.
She got caught on purpose.
No, she didn't.
That was her one mistake.
Think about it.
She's a proven local asset doing what?
Ratting out her competition.
So she's got a perfect record... because all she has to do is point to Tonga's training camp... and scream "Al-Qaeda" and we just vaporize it.
Yep.
And physical confirmation is needed now.
And she gets caught somehow... by Tonga... the one person that can ID her.
He was about to tell us exactly who she was.
So she offs him.
And we buy it.
Why wouldn't we?
I'm sure he did torture her.
Then she tells us about the yellowcake... convinces us to walk her through the gauntlet... so she doesn't miss her sale.
We still alive, right?
You do know how to pick 'em, Case.
Let's go get her.
Damn straight.
Run, run.
Why can't you like nice women, Case?
Vic, Bubba!
Vic, Bubba!
Get outta here!
Now!
What the fuck's going on?
What's all the noise?
No, no, no.
Bubba, Vic.
- Case.
- We gotta get them out.
Case, we gotta go.
Case, we gotta go, man.
Case, we gotta go.
We gotta go!
Move it.
Right.
We should go now.
Let's go.
Fuck!
Turn around.
Fuck.
Shit.
Come on, faster.
Kill them.
Jay!
Fuck, he's still alive.
Grab him.
We will use him.
- What about the other one?
- He's as good as dead.
Jay!
Just you?
Get us out of here, fast.
You got comms with Ricks?
Delta channel.
Ricks, Case on Delta channel.
- Come in.
Do you read?
- Go for Ricks.
Vic and Bubba didn't make it.
So you have three seals down there that need to come home.
And Ricks... they got Jay.
- What do you mean, they got Jay?
- Malin has him.
- How the fuck did that happen?
- The fuckin' asset is Malin.
What the fuck you want from me anyway?
You fuckin' missing Case?
I'll ask the questions.
Fuckin' bitch.
What the fuck do you think I know that can help you?
Nothing.
Kinshasa is ground zero for Malin's smuggling pipeline.
She probably has a distribution point... where she can ship out small, untraceable loads.
And now we know every bit of intel the C.I.A. has on Malin... was planted by Malin.
Okay, Case, we got three dead SEALs.
And now they got a live SEAL as a bonus.
Why the fuck are you torturing me?
Come on.
I'm not torturing you.
I'm giving you a taste... of what your new life will be like in Iran.
We know she operates from the slums.
I'm guessing the intel she was pushing never pointed there.
He's right.
Can you think of a better place to set up shop?
The cops won't go near it.
It's like another planet in there with mob rule.
Fuckin' bitch.
You might want to show a little respect.
She's protected in there.
All these warlords treat their territory the same.
Like a tribal kingdom.
We saw it in Mog back in '06.
Find me the tallest building in the slums... or directly adjacent.
She may or may not be there, but even money says she controls it.
Let's do it.
Do it.
We got an apartment complex.
Nsele Tower.
It's the tallest structure in the area.
It's right on the perimeter.
What do you think?
It's a place to start, and I'm scrambling a team to recon with you.
How long?
Two and a half hours, on the inside.
That's too long.
The window might be closed by then.
I'm gonna drop in solo.
I don't want you dropping in with nothing but your dick in your hand.
- I appreciate it.
- Here.
Take my cell phone.
Now I'm just gonna do lead recon.
I won't shake the tree until the cavalry gets there.
No.
Chase, I don't like it.
Come on, Ricks.
We're probably wrong anyway.
At least I can start eliminating possible locations, narrow the options.
Hello?
Excuse me.
Can I borrow these?
Okay, Case, listen to me.
Keep your head down and your mouth shut.
I'm done losing men today.
Me too.
Fuck me.
Ricks, got a visual on the van.
- Case, talk to me.
- Hold on, I'll take a closer look.
Empty.
Wait.
I hear something.
I'll get back to you.
I got Case again for you.
Hey, Ricks.
I think I got something for you.
Trace that voice.
Get that?
Got it.
We've confirmed the buyer is an Iranian operative named Amjad... with ties to the terrorist cell Al-Shabaab.
Amjad will probably take the final shipment of the uranium... but we suspect the final payment will be at Malin's safe house... where she is most likely holding Jay.
- Location?
- Near the old market.
Working the sat right now.
But if she hasn't broken up the payload... there should be enough to nail down the uranium signature.
Case, just observe.
Bravo is close.
They're 20 klicks out.
I gotta keep moving.
He'll lead me to Malin.
I'm not losing Jay.
Case?
He's gonna do it.
He's gotta.
Over there.
There he is.
- This way, everybody.
- Go, go, go.
- Go, go, go.
- Come on, you assholes!
Grenade!
Get back!
Get back!
Oh, you wanna play kamikaze?
Let's play kamikaze.
Get back!
Get back!
Grenade.
Shit.
Guess who.
Fire!
Thanks, Jay.
- Hello.
- You're late.
Navy SEAL, motherfucker.
There are two more detachments coming to get me out of here.
You and your friend are standing in your own grave.
How many villages are dying of radiation poisoning from work in your mine?
What do you think that's like?
I can't even imagine.
You won't have to.
Do it.
Do it.
Come on.
Do it.
You Americans are so weak.
Without your drones and missiles, you'd be nothing.
Even if you kill me, another will take my place... probably hired with the same money.
Helping people like Tonga... sacrificing innocent people... sacrificing my friends.
It has to stop.
Well, stop this.
Oh, God.
You motherfucker!
No, don't go away!
Help me!
Help me!
That is a whole lot of nuke juice.
Enough to get you in the superpower club.
Comfortable, Commander?
You realize that everybody around you is wearing a hazmat suit, right?
We're immune to nukes.
So how about a ride out of this shit hole?
Half a klick away.
I want you two to take some "R" and "R," gentlemen.
And I want you to make it count.
Thanks, Chief.
Chief.
Where should we go?
Jay, shift your weight.
Shut up, old man.
This ain't "E" and "E," it's "R" and "R" for me.
You know...
I haven't thanked you yet.
For what?
Your excellent work in picking a vacation spot.
Come on, man.
You know I was born to roll like this.
Yes, I do.
Check this kid out.
Yep, the C.I.A. is gonna be pissed.

(CHUCKLING) RICKS :

yöu haven't killed anybody yet, yöu prick.
Let's go.
CASE :
So what's got everyone hot and bothered, Chief?
PARKER :
We got some bad guys we need yöu to take care of.
And a couple of good guys we'd like back.
Now, one of the Agency's local assets in Congo... uncovered a covert military training camp... with a distinct Al-Qaeda signature.
Got a pad, new guy?
Take notes.
The asset and her C.I.A. handler... attempted physical confirmation... but were captured in the process.
PARKER :
We believe these camps engage in significant arms dealing as well.
RICKS :
I'd just as soon flatten this place from 10,000 feet... but there's a strong probability that they have our agent and his asset.
Now, the asset is a local informant...
Zoe Jelani.
French-African.
Born in Marrakech, Morocco.
Lives in Kinshasa, Congo.
She's smart, and she's a survivor.
Her C.I.A. handler is Tom Seborn.
He recruited her, and she quickly became his most valuable source with HUMINT.
Now, actionable intel from Jelani... resulted in the takedown of several major smuggling kingpins except one.
We know he goes by the name Malin.
But that's all we know.
We have no photos, no description.
This guy's invisible and a growing threat.
- We believe he's supplying this camp with weapons.
- (NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)
Now, the leader of this camp is this man...
General Japhet Tonga.
A major rebel, figure in the civil war wanted for war crimes, genocide and all that other Anderson Cooper bullshit.
He's a major asshole.
- What's his affiliation with Al-Qaeda?
- We're not sure.
But he understands that zealotry plus money equals power, and that's his god.
We are gonna quickly and not so quietly take it apart for him.
I like dealing with yöu.
yöu always deliver.
Yeah.

Those are troop designations.
It's got every entry point covered.
Whatever that is, he's guarding it like Fort Knox.
It's a mine, and he's been paid a lot of money to make sure no one knows it exists.
Question is, what's he pulling out?
Only two things come out of the ground in this region...
Copper... and uranium.
I discovered this place while tracking an illegal arms dealer.
Malin.
That's right.
We knew Tonga was receiving weapons, but what we didn't know is that he wasn't buying them.
- They were payment for his services.
- He's working with Malin.
- Shit.
- He's working for Malin... who's been stockpiling yellowcake uranium for a major sale.
BUBBA :
Sir.
According to this, there's been a major influx of activity around the mine.
- Then I guess the sale's happening soon.
- Thirty-six hours.
And how would yöu know that exactly?
Tonga.
Sure.
Let's go.
yöu're bullshitting me.
We gotta keep going.
We've a patch-through.
Case.
I'm sitting here with the C.I.A.
How solid is yöur intel on the mine and this yellowcake sale?
Just over 100%.
All right.
Here's the deal.
I will have no other resources in the area, and we're obviously on the clock.
I need yöur team to pull a double.
- Sir?
- At this time,
I have no authorization... for an extra team or air support without confirmation, except for an extraction.
Okay.
Maybe I wasn't clear about the yellowcake.
It's the uranium type.
Uranium's legally mined in that region... and there are about 10 international agencies... counting every ounce of yellowcake produced... making damn sure what yöur intel says is happening never happens.
So yöu can imagine the kind of politics that we...
Listen, Case.
The guys in D.C. cried wolf about this African yellowcake once before.
We both know how that turned out.
Yes, I do.
Listen.
I need yöu standing on top of that shit... smoking gun in hand, before any of this is on the record.
Now, yöur mission is to confirm that mine is producing uranium... stop the sale and expose the buyer... and yöu gotta do it with what yöu showed up with.
yöu got better intel this time, right?
That'll be a giant pain in the ass, sir.
I know.
Consider it done.
Copy.
yöu're fighting a war.
This ain't a goddamn game.
I got deja vu.
That's a bag of dicks, chief.
Sounds fubar.
I second yöur fubar, and I raise yöu a fugly.
Hooyah.
Hey.
- If it don't suck...
- ALL :
We don't do it.
What else can yöu tell me about the mine?
I'll tell yöu on the way.
I'm going with yöu.
No, I don't think so.
I'm the only one who knows this area and where Tonga's troops are.
yöu need me.
D'accord?
Sir?
Yeah.
Case on the line.
Thanks.
Listen.
The C.I.A. wants their money.
Just bury it with a G.P.S. tracker.
They'll get it later.
Copy.
yöur sat phone is our only eyes and ears now.
No more direct contact with the comms.
Roger that.
Good luck.
Collins.
WOMAN :
Sir.
(PHONE BEEPS)
(COMPUTER BEEPING)
Lose this and we're sending smoke signals.
No pressure.
We gotta bury the money.
- C.I.A.?
- Yup.
Just the dollars then.
- Bubba.
- Sir!
yöu gotta dig a hole, bury all the US currency.
And put a tracker on it.
Sir.
So we're here.
There's about 25 klicks between us and the mine.
This is the road.
It's heavily patrolled with Tonga's soldiers.
Even with Tonga dead, Malin will have another general take over operations.
So we go around.
The terrain is very difficult.
It would take us days.
Nothing new there.
Tell me what yöu know about him.
Very little, unfortunately.
We don't know if he's one person or a network.
But he's controlled the illegal arms trade in Congo for years.
Now he's moved on to brokering uranium.
No one knows his real name.
Malin is French.
For "sly," like a fox.
Yeah.
JAY :
Bubba.
BUBBA :
Sir.
We got two days of rations and water left.
Ordnance is the issue though.
Rounds are down to 40.
Hey, lady.
Here.
Take it.
Ever used one of these?
I'll take that as a yes.
Let's do it.
(CHUCKLES)
ZOE :
We need to follow this river up east to get to the first pass.
CASE :
Let's take the boat.
We'll take it quietly.
(HUMMING) (WHISTLING)
(URINATING)
Hostile, 3:00.
Start her up, Bubba.
(SHOUTING, INDISTINCT)
They are stealing the boat!
They are stealing the boat!
- Here they come.
- Cover fire!
Cover fire!
Go!
Go!
Dan, right flank!
Right!
Fire!
JAY :
More hostiles, 9:00.
Incoming.
Get down!
ZOE :
Watch out, Bubba!
CASE :
Turn around.
We gotta get Bubba.
BUBBA :
Over here, guys.
Over here!
- Guys.
Pick me up!
- Come on.
We can make it.
Bubba!
Bubba, hold yöur hand out.
Bubba, give me yöur hand.
Come on.
Pull him up.
Pull him up.
Come on.
Move.
Faster.
Faster.
CASE :
Fuck!
It's a dead end.
Turn left.
Turn left!
Dan, Vic!
Right flank!
We're dead in the water!
Ah, fuck!
Case, look out!
JAY :
The boat!
The boat!
Case, the boat!
Get out!
- Case!
- Look out!
Case!
Keep moving.
Don't stop!
Don't stop!
Let's go.
Come on.
Go, go, go!
(INDISTINCT) I'll cover yöu.
Go!
Dan!
Dan!
(MAN SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
Fuck yöu!
Fuck yöu!
Fuck yöu!
They fragged Dan, man.
Jesus Christ!
He's all over the fucking place!
Follow the river.
Follow the river.
We gotta go.
I was supposed to watch him!
Keep it tight.
It's not yöur fault, all right?
There's nothing yöu could have done.
Now we need yöu, buddy.
Okay?
So let's go.
Let's go.
Come on.
Let's go.
Fuck!
(CONTINUES)
Confirmed.
The link is no longer active.
We should assume the worst.
No, we shouldn't.
Request satellite imaging on that coordinate... five minutes on either side of the signal fail.
Fuck!
We've lost comms.
Dan had the fucking sat phone.
We need to set up the 4-M.C. Comms?
We've lost comms?
What the fuck about the man we just lost?
Vic!
Two, six, 10.
Shut yöur fucking cockhole, Bubba.
yöu all right, Bubs?
Let's take a look at this.
yöu all right?
Yeah.
yöu?
Yeah.
CASE :
Here.
Okay?
Okay.
It's not yöur first time being shot, huh?
It's probably not my last.
I hope it is.
Tell me if it hurts.
It's fine.
Let's just fix that.
Under here.
Mmm.
Should do it.
Okay?
Thank yöu.
All right.
Here.
That's good.
What?
yöu're dangerous.
yöu know that?
yöu have no idea.
(MAN SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
Sir, we got some smoke up ahead.
Let's check it out.
(CONTINUES)
- CASE :
What the fuck happened here?
- ZOE :
Tonga happened.
CASE :
It's flamethrower accelerant.
VIC :
I guess from that same batch of goodies those vz. 58s came from.
(FLIES BUZZING)
Jesus.
CASE :
Why would Tonga do this?
These people are no threat to him.
They chose the wrong side.
Throw a dart round here and yöu hit a different rebel faction.
What side is the wrong side?
Any side but Tonga's.
(COUGHING)
(SHOUTING IN FRENCH)
- JAY :
What's he saying?
- ZOE : "Die, devil, die."
We're not here to hurt yöu.
We're here to help.
All right?
- Hey, kid.
- (ZOE SPEAKING FRENCH)
Hey, kid.
Kid.
Kid.
Look.
All right?
Jay.
Put that down.
Just trying to protect what's left of his village.
Hey, kid.
Kid, come here.
Look.
Shake my hand.
Come on.
Come on.
Put that down.
Shake my hand.
Hey.
Hey.
yöu all right?
ZOE :
For the last week, the villagers saw a convoy of trucks... coming through the pass every morning about an hour after sunup.
- CASE :
Convoy comes every day?
- Every day.
yöu're thinking about hitching a ride?
Fighting isn't the only thing we're good at.
Hey, Bubba.
Sir.
Come here.
All right.
I got good news and really good news.
Good news is yöu boys have exactly one hour to cop some Z's.
Think of it as a mini vacation.
And the really good news?
Then we're gonna breach a moving convoy... loaded with Tonga's troops.
(CHUCKLES) yöu're welcome.
Goddamn.
Damn.
That's real good news.
He's due.
Fuck him.
I'm due.
Know what Dan would have said.
All right.
I better help the new guy with the truck.
He'll probably fuck it up.
Fucking will.
How'd yöu learn to shoot like that?
When I was 12, I pretended I was a boy and joined the army in Kinshasa.
It was during the civil war, so there was no training, no physicals... nothing.
They just took yöu straight to the battlefield with yöur own clothes.
When they discovered I was a girl I was already leading a unit... so they kept me.
No.
I don't buy it.
What?
Why?
It's hard to believe yöu could ever have been mistaken for a boy.
So yöu said fighting wasn't the only thing yöu were good at?
It isn't.
Come here.
(PANTING)
(MAN SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
BUBBA :
So what's the M.O., sir?
CASE :
Give me a minute.
Just trying to put all the pieces together.
Thinking we do the Korengal Valley thing.
Which one?
First one.
I remember.
That got fucked up, right?
Yeah, but it was a better plan.
And I don't see any goat herders around here, do yöu?
JAY :
All right.
First one it is.
So what are we doing?
How complicated is this?
JAY :
Extremely.
Look.
- The truck stops there, right?
- Uh-huh.
We get on.
Okay.
(CONTINUES)
Get down. yöu, yöu, yöu!
Go, go, go!
Now!
- Go.
Go.
- Get in there.
Get in there.
Quick.
Get on the floor.
Get on the ground.
Okay.
Everyone in position.
JAY :
One, two, three.
Let's go.
We need to assume... some of the operators are still viable.
Rescue protocol should give me at least one robot... start clearing some of the bad guys out of the area... give who is ever left out there... some sort of sporting chance.
COLLINS :
Yes, sir.
I'm on it.
Thank yöu, Collins.
Never assume the worst, Parker.
Never.
Sir.
Even if it is true.
I'm the new general in charge here, so hurry up.
Move it.
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
Faster, faster.
Faster, faster.
(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
Faster, faster.
(SPITS)
(FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)
(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
How long do we have until this rat trap stops?
Forty-five minutes, an hour at the most.
Carb up, fellas.
There might be some drama in the second half.
BUBBA :
Sir, I think we got something here.
Farsi.
Those markings.
Takavar.
Iranian special forces.
Maybe we got the buyer.
I'd imagine we're looking at their good-faith deposit.
Comms.
Jackpot.
Looks like it might be a good day after all.
Bubba, get yöur ass over here.
Stop fiddling'.
If we can get hold of CENTCOM... and let them know that we're mission forward... they might not flatten the place before we get there.
- How's yöur Persian, bro?
- Fuckin' awesome.
If it was backwards.
Don't worry, 'cause all yöu have to do is find a satcom frequency... and we can tap into our own mission channel.
Ticktock.
Come on.
MAN ON RADIO :
California, please take out all enemy hostiles.
Did that person sound like...
MAN #2 :
Four klicks to target.
Weapons are hot.
(RADIO STATIC)
Shit.
They're taking out the mines.
Without confirming the intel, it'll be next to impossible to get that approved.
How long have we been off-line?
Eight hours and change.
Ricks has probably initiated rescue measures.
But without visual confirmation or a request from us, he cannot send another team.
He'll be looking for the most visible concentration of enemy hostiles.
Get the low-hanging fruit first.
He could put a bird in the air, clear out the hostiles from the rescue perimeter... assuming we're still operational.
So cavalry's gonna take care of some bad guys for us.
Good.
JAY :
We in the convoy full of bad guys, numbnuts.
Put yöur helmet on, Bubba.
People, we have about 30 seconds to un-fuck ourselves.
What are we gonna do?
River, 20 seconds.
Hey, don't yöu think we should confirm strike?
Confirmed!
- It's a hit.
- Confirmed hit.
Everyone out!
(SHOUTING)
(DRONE PASSING)
- Go in for a second sweep.
- Copy that.
Incoming!
- Move out.
On me!
- JAY :
Go, go, go!
Bubba!
CASE :
Bubba, get out!
- It's a hit.
- Roger that.
Confirmed hit.
What the?
Those are our guys.
- California, abort mission!
Abort!
- Shit!
Goddamn it!
We got a goddamn situation here!
(GASPS) Come on, Bubs.
I got yöu.
Stay with me, man.
Stay with me.
Come on.
- Get down here!
- Cover me.
I'm going in.
CASE :
Help me get him out.
Help me get him out.
He's still breathing.
I got him.
We got yöu, Bubs.
One, two, three.
- Get his hand grenades.
- Pull his vest off.
All right.
Gun over.
Watch his face.
Gun over.
- We gotta stop the bleeding.
- Over his face.
- Open him up.
- Vic!
Jam as much of that in the wound as possible.
Gauze.
(GROANING) Easy, Bubs.
Easy.
Easy. yöu're okay.
(GROANING) Easy.
yöu're all right, buddy.
Look at me.
Look at me.
yöu're all right.
Bubba, look at me.
Just breathe.
Take it easy.
(PANTING)
Just keep breathing.
Does this hole qualify me for the good shit, sir?
Close enough.
yöu're all right.
It's okay, kid.
Let's tie this off.
Let's get that shirt off.
Come on.
Up yöu go, Bubs.
- Get him on his feet.
- There yöu go.
Getting some color back.
yöu're blushing.
- Here yöu go.
- Just tie it off.
All right.
On three.
One, two, three.
Hey.
All right, look at me.
Are yöu doing good?
Sir.
Sorry about the truck, sir.
Don't mention it.
Come on.
yöu all right?
Yes, sir.
yöu good?
Yeah.
How much further?
A couple of hours.
Hey, what was in that syringe?
A little of everything, I expect.
(MAN SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
Collins, confirm the head count.
I still show five.
Okay, we lost one of our boys.
But I don't think, for the record... we can positively I.D. the individuals on the ground as our own.
But, sir, I think it's clear...
Since we cannot make a positive ID... this remains an official search-and-rescue operation... and we can therefore keep our bird on scene.
So in case those happen to be our boys... we should let them know we have eyes on them.
California, this is Gray Base One.
Please stand by for orders.
MAN ON RADIO :
Gray Base One, California standing by.
Again?
Seriously?
These guys don't fight from 200 feet.
If they're down this low, it's to say, "Hey, we know yöu're up and running."
Mind if I do the honors?
Be my guest.
I believe we have confirmation our team understands eyes are back on.
yöu think, Parker?
All right.
Let's get California back up top.
Eyes only until they need us.
- California, pull back.
- Gray Base One, California will comply.
ZOE :
We're almost there.
The mines are just on the other side of this pass.
MAN :
We're clear.
MAN #2 :
Okay, close the gate.
MAN :
Let's go.
CASE :
Victor.
See the mine shaft?
Two guard detachments, both sheltered.
Guards are staying put.
CASE :
So any satellite images will show this place is still inactive.
Which means Malin's hideout will be underground.
A foxhole.
Definitely.
The few things we've learned about Malin... have always been the opposite of what we assumed.
Collins, let's get up close and personal in case they need the support.
Yes, sir.
PARKER :
California, this is Gray Base One.
Please adjust to an 8K ceiling for max visual and pending support.
Gray Base One, California will comply.
Repeat.
Will comply.
JAY :
So what's the plan?
Kamikaze with a twist?
I got yöu.
Kamikaze... with a twist?
yöu're gonna love this one.
(ENGINE STARTS)
Hey, who's that?
Watch out.
(LAUGHING) Nobody's in the truck.
Go, go, go.
- Another fuckin' .50-cal.
- Grenade!
CASE :
Don't stop.
Keep moving.
Keep moving.
- CASE :
Bubba!
- BUBBA :
Grenade!
CASE :
Let's go!
Move up!
VIC :
Case.
What yöu got?
Map.
yöu guys take the main entrance.
I'll take the elevator.
We'll meet in the middle.
Fuckin' maverick.
I got yöu.
All right.
On me.
We ain't here to hurt yöu.
- They're just miners.
- All right.
Stack up.
(GUNSHOTS)
CASE :
Boys ready to go down the rabbit hole?
JAY :
That's why we came, right?
(GUNSHOT) Goddamn it.
On yöur 6:00, Case.
On yöur 6:00.
This has to be the spot.
Yeah.
These guys seem pretty motivated.
Guarding the king's quarters.
Jay, me and yöu take the right flank.
The rest of yöu...
VIC :
Bubba, on me.
(GUNSHOTS)
Bubba, go.
Sir.
Get down!
- Goddamn it.
- B!
Bubba, yöu all right?
I'll check if it's over here.
Zoe, wait.
Stay together.
Goddamn it.
Hey, B. Bubs.
CASE :
Vic, we're on yöur 6:00.
- What happened?
- A knife.
- yöu okay?
Where's Zoe?
- Went that way.
We'll take that section, find her.
Look after Bubs.
Go.
I've got him.
Hey.
Hey, B. Bubs, hang in there, kid.
Malin better be still alive.
Motherfucker!
Who betrayed me?
Who, mother cocksucker?
(SHOUTS)
(DRONE PASSES) yöu've gotta be shitting me.
Tail pipe, now.
(COMPUTER BEEPING)
Shit!
- yöu got a missile lock.
- I know.
- All right.
Evasive action.
- Countermeasure engaged.
(BEEPING CONTINUES)
California, Gray Base One.
We seem to have lost our feed.
Please advise.
yöu two, go to the safe house.
Set up a meeting.
What the hell's going on?
WOMAN :
Get Commander Ricks on the line right now.
Yes, ma'am.
yöu two, come with me.
JAY :
Y'all think that Zoe chick's gonna be all right?
Haven't yöu been paying attention?
This lady knows exactly what she's doing.
Left.
Got an office down here?
JAY :
I'm gonna do a sweep.
Be back in two minutes.
All right.
Sweep done, man.
All clear.
No sign of Zoe.
No sign of guards.
No sign of nothing.
- I just e-mailed CENTCOM.
- E-mail?
Yeah, no landline.
Malin's network.
The best I could do.
PARKER :
Commander, yöu need to see this. yöu're not gonna believe it... but a message from the team was just routed to us from Little Creek.
What?
They sent an e-mail to their home base... requesting immediate medevac.
An e-mail?
That's brilliant.
Collins, we need the helicopter.
I need field medics on standby.
We got a SEAL down.
I repeat.
We got a SEAL down.
Make it happen, goddamn it.
Figure it out.
Where is this Malin anyway, the yellowcake?
I don't know.
Soldiers for hire don't fight like that to protect an empty nest.
Malin's here.
I'm sure of it.
We're missing something.
Yeah, like?
So Malin pays Tonga to secure the area... so he can quietly stockpile yellowcake for a huge sale.
But there's a problem when yöu pay an army for protection.
Yeah, like who's gonna protect yöu from the army?
Exactly.
So Tonga realizes that the shit he's paid to protect... is worth more than he's being paid to protect it.
He becomes a threat.
Malin has no way of taking him out.
JAY :
It turns out he don't need to.
We do it for him.
Who pushed over the first domino?
We took out Tonga's camp based on intel from the local asset...
Zoe Jelani.
JAY :
She got caught on purpose.
No, she didn't.
That was her one mistake.
Think about it.
She's a proven local asset doing what?
Ratting out her competition.
So she's got a perfect record... because all she has to do is point to Tonga's training camp... and scream "Al-Qaeda" and we just vaporize it.
Yep.
And physical confirmation is needed now.
CASE :
And she gets caught somehow... by Tonga... the one person that can ID her.
(CHUCKLES) He was about to tell us exactly who she was.
So she offs him.
And we buy it.
Why wouldn't we?
I'm sure he did torture her.
Then she tells us about the yellowcake... convinces us to walk her through the gauntlet... so she doesn't miss her sale.
We still alive, right?
yöu do know how to pick 'em, Case.
Let's go get her.
Damn straight.
Run, run.
Why can't yöu like nice women, Case?
Vic, Bubba!
Vic, Bubba!
Get outta here!
Now!
What the fuck's going on?
What's all the noise?
No, no, no.
Bubba, Vic.
- Case.
- We gotta get them out.
Case, we gotta go.
Case, we gotta go, man.
Case, we gotta go.
We gotta go!
Move it.
Right.
We should go now.
MAN :
Let's go.
(GUNSHOTS)
Fuck!
Turn around.
Fuck.
Shit.
Come on, faster.
Kill them.
Jay!
- (GRUNTS)
- Fuck, he's still alive.
Grab him.
We will use him.
- What about the other one?
- He's as good as dead.
(GRUNTS) Jay!
Just yöu?
Get us out of here, fast.
yöu got comms with Ricks?
Delta channel.
(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)
Ricks, Case on Delta channel.
- Come in.
Do yöu read?
- Go for Ricks.
Vic and Bubba didn't make it.
So yöu have three seals down there that need to come home.
And Ricks... they got Jay.
- What do yöu mean, they got Jay?
- Malin has him.
- How the fuck did that happen?
- The fuckin' asset is Malin.
JAY :
What the fuck yöu want from me anyway?
yöu fuckin' missing Case?
I'll ask the questions.
Fuckin' bitch.
(COUGHING)
(CHUCKLES)
JAY :
What the fuck do yöu think I know that can help yöu?
Nothing.
CASE :
Kinshasa is ground zero for Malin's smuggling pipeline.
She probably has a distribution point... where she can ship out small, untraceable loads.
And now we know every bit of intel the C.I.A. has on Malin... was planted by Malin.
Okay, Case, we got three dead SEALs.
And now they got a live SEAL as a bonus.
(JAY SHOUTING)
Why the fuck are yöu torturing me?
Come on.
I'm not torturing yöu.
I'm giving yöu a taste... of what yöur new life will be like in Iran.
CASE :
We know she operates from the slums.
I'm guessing the intel she was pushing never pointed there.
He's right.
Can yöu think of a better place to set up shop?
The cops won't go near it.
It's like another planet in there with mob rule.
Fuckin' bitch.
(ZOE LAUGHING) yöu might want to show a little respect.
(SHOUTS)
(COUGHING)
CASE :
She's protected in there.
All these warlords treat their territory the same.
Like a tribal kingdom.
We saw it in Mog back in '06.
Find me the tallest building in the slums... or directly adjacent.
She may or may not be there, but even money says she controls it.
Let's do it.
Do it.
We got an apartment complex.
Nsele Tower.
It's the tallest structure in the area.
It's right on the perimeter.
What do yöu think?
It's a place to start, and I'm scrambling a team to recon with yöu.
How long?
Two and a half hours, on the inside.
That's too long.
The window might be closed by then.
I'm gonna drop in solo.
I don't want yöu dropping in with nothing but yöur dick in yöur hand.
- I appreciate it.
- Here.
Take my cell phone.
CASE :
Now I'm just gonna do lead recon.
I won't shake the tree until the cavalry gets there.
RICKS :
No.
Chase, I don't like it.
Come on, Ricks.
We're probably wrong anyway.
CASE :
At least I can start eliminating possible locations, narrow the options.
Hello?
Excuse me.
Can I borrow these?
Okay, Case, listen to me.
Keep yöur head down and yöur mouth shut.
I'm done losing men today.
Me too.
Fuck me.
Ricks, got a visual on the van.
- Case, talk to me.
- Hold on, I'll take a closer look.
Empty.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Wait.
I hear something.
I'll get back to yöu.
(RINGING CONTINUES)
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
I got Case again for yöu.
CASE :
Hey, Ricks.
I think I got something for yöu.
(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
(MAN SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
Trace that voice.
Get that?
Got it.
We've confirmed the buyer is an Iranian operative named Amjad... with ties to the terrorist cell Al-Shabaab.
Amjad will probably take the final shipment of the uranium... but we suspect the final payment will be at Malin's safe house... where she is most likely holding Jay.
- Location?
- Near the old market.
Working the sat right now.
But if she hasn't broken up the payload... there should be enough to nail down the uranium signature.

(PARKER) We got some bad guys we need you to take care of.
And a couple of good guys we'd like back.
Now, one of the Agency's local assets in Congo... uncovered a covert military training camp... with a distinct Al-Qaeda signature.
Got a pad, new guy?
Take notes.
The asset and her C.I.A. handler... attempted physical confirmation... but were captured in the process.
(PARKER) We believe these camps engage in significant arms dealing as well.

Zoe Jelani.

Born in Marrakech, Morocco.
Lives in Kinshasa, Congo.
She's smart, and she's a survivor.
Her C.I.A. handler is Tom Seborn.
He recruited her, and she quickly became his most valuable source with HUMINT.
Now, actionable intel from Jelani... resulted in the takedown of several major smuggling kingpins except one.
We know he goes by the name Malin.
But that's all we know.
We have no photos, no description.
This guy's invisible and a growing threat.
- We believe he's supplying this camp with weapons.
- (NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)
Now, the leader of this camp is this man...
General Japhet Tonga.
A major rebel, figure in the civil war wanted for war crimes, genocide and all that other Anderson Cooper bullshit.
He's a major asshole.
- What's his affiliation with Al-Qaeda?
- We're not sure.
But he understands that zealotry plus money equals power, and that's his god.
We are gonna quickly and not so quietly take it apart for him.

That's some serious fuck-you money.

(CASE) Now why would the general here have all this cash on hand?
Sir.
Those are troop designations.
It's got every entry point covered.
Whatever that is, he's guarding it like Fort Knox.
It's a mine, and he's been paid a lot of money to make sure no one knows it exists.
Question is, what's he pulling out?
Only two things come out of the ground in this region...
Copper... and uranium.
I discovered this place while tracking an illegal arms dealer.
Malin.
That's right.
We knew Tonga was receiving weapons, but what we didn't know is that he wasn't buying them.
- They were payment for his services.
- He's working with Malin.
- Shit.
- He's working for Malin... who's been stockpiling yellowcake uranium for a major sale.
(BUBBA) Sir.
According to this, there's been a major influx of activity around the mine.
- Then I guess the sale's happening soon.
- Thirty-six hours.
And how would you know that exactly?
Tonga.
Sure.
Let's go.
You're bullshitting me.
We gotta keep going.
We've a patch-through.
Case.
I'm sitting here with the C.I.A.
How solid is your intel on the mine and this yellowcake sale?
Just over 100%.
All right.
Here's the deal.
I will have no other resources in the area, and we're obviously on the clock.
I need your team to pull a double.
- Sir?
- At this time,
I have no authorization... for an extra team or air support without confirmation, except for an extraction.
Okay.
Maybe I wasn't clear about the yellowcake.
It's the uranium type.
Uranium's legally mined in that region... and there are about 10 international agencies... counting every ounce of yellowcake produced... making damn sure what your intel says is happening never happens.
So you can imagine the kind of politics that we...
Listen, Case.
The guys in D.C. cried wolf about this African yellowcake once before.
We both know how that turned out.
Yes, I do.
Listen.
I need you standing on top of that shit... smoking gun in hand, before any of this is on the record.
Now, your mission is to confirm that mine is producing uranium... stop the sale and expose the buyer... and you gotta do it with what you showed up with.
You got better intel this time, right?
That'll be a giant pain in the ass, sir.
I know.
Consider it done.
Copy.
You're fighting a war.
This ain't a goddamn game.
I got deja vu.
That's a bag of dicks, chief.

- (ALL) We don't do it.

I'll tell you on the way.

No, I don't think so.
I'm the only one who knows this area and where Tonga's troops are.
You need me.
D'accord?

Yeah.

And put a tracker on it.
Sir.
So we're here.
There's about 25 klicks between us and the mine.
This is the road.
It's heavily patrolled with Tonga's soldiers.
Even with Tonga dead, Malin will have another general take over operations.
So we go around.
The terrain is very difficult.
It would take us days.
Nothing new there.
Tell me what you know about him.
Very little, unfortunately.
We don't know if he's one person or a network.
But he's controlled the illegal arms trade in Congo for years.
Now he's moved on to brokering uranium.
No one knows his real name.
Malin is French.

Maybe we got the buyer.
I'd imagine we're looking at their good-faith deposit.
Comms.
Jackpot.
Looks like it might be a good day after all.
Bubba, get your ass over here.
Stop fiddling'.
If we can get hold of CENTCOM... and let them know that we're mission forward... they might not flatten the place before we get there.
- How's your Persian, bro?
- Fuckin' awesome.
If it was backwards.
Don't worry, 'cause all you have to do is find a satcom frequency... and we can tap into our own mission channel.
Ticktock.
Come on.
(MAN ON RADIO) California, please take out all enemy hostiles.
Did that person sound like... (MAN #2) Four klicks to target.
Weapons are hot.
(RADIO STATIC)
Shit.
They're taking out the mines.
Without confirming the intel, it'll be next to impossible to get that approved.
How long have we been off-line?
Eight hours and change.
Ricks has probably initiated rescue measures.
But without visual confirmation or a request from us, he cannot send another team.
He'll be looking for the most visible concentration of enemy hostiles.
Get the low-hanging fruit first.
He could put a bird in the air, clear out the hostiles from the rescue perimeter... assuming we're still operational.
So cavalry's gonna take care of some bad guys for us.
Good.
(JAY) We in the convoy full of bad guys, numbnuts.
Put your helmet on, Bubba.
People, we have about 30 seconds to un-fuck ourselves.
What are we gonna do?

Collins, confirm the head count.
I still show five.
Okay, we lost one of our boys.
But I don't think, for the record... we can positively I.D. the individuals on the ground as our own.
But, sir, I think it's clear...
Since we cannot make a positive ID... this remains an official search-and-rescue operation... and we can therefore keep our bird on scene.
So in case those happen to be our boys... we should let them know we have eyes on them.
California, this is Gray Base One.

Yes, ma'am.
You two, come with me.

This lady knows exactly what she's doing.
Left.
Got an office down here?
(JAY) I'm gonna do a sweep.
Be back in two minutes.
All right.
Sweep done, man.
All clear.
No sign of Zoe.
No sign of guards.
No sign of nothing.
- I just e-mailed CENTCOM.
- E-mail?
Yeah, no landline.
Malin's network.
The best I could do.
(PARKER) Commander, you need to see this.
You're not gonna believe it... but a message from the team was just routed to us from Little Creek.
What?
They sent an e-mail to their home base... requesting immediate medevac.
An e-mail?
That's brilliant.
Collins, we need the helicopter.
I need field medics on standby.
We got a SEAL down.
I repeat.
We got a SEAL down.
Make it happen, goddamn it.
Figure it out.
Where is this Malin anyway, the yellowcake?
I don't know.
Soldiers for hire don't fight like that to protect an empty nest.
Malin's here.
I'm sure of it.
We're missing something.
Yeah, like?
So Malin pays Tonga to secure the area... so he can quietly stockpile yellowcake for a huge sale.
But there's a problem when you pay an army for protection.
Yeah, like who's gonna protect you from the army?
Exactly.
So Tonga realizes that the shit he's paid to protect... is worth more than he's being paid to protect it.
He becomes a threat.
Malin has no way of taking him out.
(JAY) It turns out he don't need to.
We do it for him.
Who pushed over the first domino?
We took out Tonga's camp based on intel from the local asset...
Zoe Jelani.
(JAY) She got caught on purpose.
No, she didn't.
That was her one mistake.
Think about it.
She's a proven local asset doing what?
Ratting out her competition.
So she's got a perfect record... because all she has to do is point to Tonga's training camp... and scream "Al-Qaeda" and we just vaporize it.
Yep.
And physical confirmation is needed now.
(CASE) And she gets caught somehow... by Tonga... the one person that can ID her.
(CHUCKLES) He was about to tell us exactly who she was.
So she offs him.
And we buy it.
Why wouldn't we?
I'm sure he did torture her.
Then she tells us about the yellowcake... convinces us to walk her through the gauntlet... so she doesn't miss her sale.
We still alive, right?
You do know how to pick 'em, Case.
Let's go get her.
Damn straight.
Run, run.
Why can't you like nice women, Case?

Get us out of here, fast.
You got comms with Ricks?
Delta channel.
(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)
Ricks, Case on Delta channel.
- Come in.
Do you read?
- Go for Ricks.
Vic and Bubba didn't make it.
So you have three seals down there that need to come home.
And Ricks... they got Jay.
- What do you mean, they got Jay?
- Malin has him.
- How the fuck did that happen?
- The fuckin' asset is Malin.
(JAY) What the fuck you want from me anyway?
You fuckin' missing Case?
I'll ask the questions.
Fuckin' bitch.
(COUGHING)
(CHUCKLES)
(JAY) What the fuck do you think I know that can help you?
Nothing.
(CASE) Kinshasa is ground zero for Malin's smuggling pipeline.
She probably has a distribution point... where she can ship out small, untraceable loads.
And now we know every bit of intel the C.I.A. has on Malin... was planted by Malin.
Okay, Case, we got three dead SEALs.
And now they got a live SEAL as a bonus.
(JAY SHOUTING)
Why the fuck are you torturing me?
Come on.
I'm not torturing you.
I'm giving you a taste... of what your new life will be like in Iran.
(CASE) We know she operates from the slums.
I'm guessing the intel she was pushing never pointed there.
He's right.
Can you think of a better place to set up shop?
The cops won't go near it.
It's like another planet in there with mob rule.
Fuckin' bitch.
(ZOE LAUGHING)
You might want to show a little respect.
(SHOUTS)
(COUGHING)
(CASE) She's protected in there.
All these warlords treat their territory the same.
Like a tribal kingdom.
We saw it in Mog back in '06.
Find me the tallest building in the slums... or directly adjacent.
She may or may not be there, but even money says she controls it.
Let's do it.
Do it.
We got an apartment complex.
Nsele Tower.
It's the tallest structure in the area.
It's right on the perimeter.
What do you think?
It's a place to start, and I'm scrambling a team to recon with you.
How long?
Two and a half hours, on the inside.
That's too long.
The window might be closed by then.
I'm gonna drop in solo.
I don't want you dropping in with nothing but your dick in your hand.
- I appreciate it.
- Here.
Take my cell phone.
(CASE) Now I'm just gonna do lead recon.
I won't shake the tree until the cavalry gets there.
(RICKS) No.
Chase, I don't like it.
Come on, Ricks.
We're probably wrong anyway.
(CASE) At least I can start eliminating possible locations, narrow the options.
Hello?
Excuse me.
Can I borrow these?
Okay, Case, listen to me.
Keep your head down and your mouth shut.
I'm done losing men today.
Me too.
Fuck me.
Ricks, got a visual on the van.
- Case, talk to me.
- Hold on, I'll take a closer look.
Empty.

I'll get back to you.

I got Case again for you.
(CASE) Hey, Ricks.
I think I got something for you.
(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
(MAN SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
Trace that voice.
Get that?
Got it.
We've confirmed the buyer is an Iranian operative named Amjad... with ties to the terrorist cell Al-Shabaab.
Amjad will probably take the final shipment of the uranium... but we suspect the final payment will be at Malin's safe house... where she is most likely holding Jay.
- Location?
- Near the old market.
Working the sat right now.
But if she hasn't broken up the payload... there should be enough to nail down the uranium signature.
Case, just observe.
Bravo is close.
They're 20 klicks out.
I gotta keep moving.
He'll lead me to Malin.
I'm not losing Jay.

Now, one of the Agency's local assets in Congo... uncovered a covert military training camp... with a distinct Al-Qaeda signature.
Got a pad, new guy?
Take notes.
The asset and her C.I.A. handler... attempted physical confirmation... but were captured in the process.
(PARKER) We believe these camps engage in significant arms dealing as well.

Lives in Kinshasa, Congo.
She's smart, and she's a survivor.
Her C.I.A. handler is Tom Seborn.
He recruited her, and she quickly became his most valuable source with HUMINT.

(WHISTLES)
That's some serious fuck-you money.
It's a good thing we're not in this for the money.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, good thing.
(CASE) Now why would the general here have all this cash on hand?
Sir.
Those are troop designations.
It's got every entry point covered.
Whatever that is, he's guarding it like Fort Knox.
It's a mine, and he's been paid a lot of money to make sure no one knows it exists.
Question is, what's he pulling out?
Only two things come out of the ground in this region...
Copper... and uranium.
I discovered this place while tracking an illegal arms dealer.
Malin.
That's right.
We knew Tonga was receiving weapons, but what we didn't know is that he wasn't buying them.
- They were payment for his services.
- He's working with Malin.
- Shit.
- He's working for Malin... who's been stockpiling yellowcake uranium for a major sale.
(BUBBA) Sir.
According to this, there's been a major influx of activity around the mine.
- Then I guess the sale's happening soon.
- Thirty-six hours.
And how would you know that exactly?
Tonga.
Sure.
Let's go.
You're bullshitting me.
We gotta keep going.
We've a patch-through.
Case.
I'm sitting here with the C.I.A.
How solid is your intel on the mine and this yellowcake sale?
Just over 100%.
All right.
Here's the deal.
I will have no other resources in the area, and we're obviously on the clock.
I need your team to pull a double.
- Sir?
- At this time,
I have no authorization... for an extra team or air support without confirmation, except for an extraction.
Okay.
Maybe I wasn't clear about the yellowcake.
It's the uranium type.
Uranium's legally mined in that region... and there are about 10 international agencies... counting every ounce of yellowcake produced... making damn sure what your intel says is happening never happens.
So you can imagine the kind of politics that we...
Listen, Case.
The guys in D.C. cried wolf about this African yellowcake once before.
We both know how that turned out.
Yes, I do.
Listen.
I need you standing on top of that shit... smoking gun in hand, before any of this is on the record.
Now, your mission is to confirm that mine is producing uranium... stop the sale and expose the buyer... and you gotta do it with what you showed up with.
You got better intel this time, right?
That'll be a giant pain in the ass, sir.
I know.
Consider it done.
Copy.
You're fighting a war.
This ain't a goddamn game.
I got deja vu.
That's a bag of dicks, chief.
Sounds fubar.
I second your fubar, and I raise you a fugly.
Hooyah.
Hey.
- If it don't suck...
- (ALL) We don't do it.
What else can you tell me about the mine?
I'll tell you on the way.
I'm going with you.
No, I don't think so.
I'm the only one who knows this area and where Tonga's troops are.
You need me.
D'accord?
Sir?
Yeah.
Case on the line.
Thanks.
Listen.
The C.I.A. wants their money.
Just bury it with a G.P.S. tracker.
They'll get it later.
Copy.

We gotta bury the money.
- C.I.A.?
- Yup.
Just the dollars then.
- Bubba.
- Sir!
You gotta dig a hole, bury all the US currency.
And put a tracker on it.
Sir.
So we're here.
There's about 25 klicks between us and the mine.
This is the road.
It's heavily patrolled with Tonga's soldiers.
Even with Tonga dead, Malin will have another general take over operations.
So we go around.
The terrain is very difficult.
It would take us days.
Nothing new there.
Tell me what you know about him.
Very little, unfortunately.
We don't know if he's one person or a network.
But he's controlled the illegal arms trade in Congo for years.
Now he's moved on to brokering uranium.
No one knows his real name.
Malin is French.
For "sly," like a fox.
Yeah.
(JAY) Bubbam (BUBBA) Sir.
We got two days of rations and water left.

But there's a problem when you pay an army for protection.
Yeah, like who's gonna protect you from the army?

You fuckin' missing Case?
I'll ask the questions.
Fuckin' bitch.
(COUGHING)
(CHUCKLES)
(JAY) What the fuck do you think I know that can help you?
Nothing.
(CASE) Kinshasa is ground zero for Malin's smuggling pipeline.
She probably has a distribution point... where she can ship out small, untraceable loads.
And now we know every bit of intel the C.I.A. has on Malin... was planted by Malin.
Okay, Case, we got three dead SEALs.
And now they got a live SEAL as a bonus.
(JAY SHOUTING)
Why the fuck are you torturing me?
Come on.
I'm not torturing you.
I'm giving you a taste... of what your new life will be like in Iran.
(CASE) We know she operates from the slums.
I'm guessing the intel she was pushing never pointed there.
He's right.
Can you think of a better place to set up shop?
The cops won't go near it.
It's like another planet in there with mob rule.
Fuckin' bitch.
(ZOE LAUGHING)
You might want to show a little respect.
(SHOUTS)
(COUGHING)
(CASE) She's protected in there.
All these warlords treat their territory the same.
Like a tribal kingdom.
We saw it in Mog back in '06.
Find me the tallest building in the slums... or directly adjacent.
She may or may not be there, but even money says she controls it.
Let's do it.
Do it.
We got an apartment complex.
Nsele Tower.
It's the tallest structure in the area.
It's right on the perimeter.
What do you think?
It's a place to start, and I'm scrambling a team to recon with you.
How long?
Two and a half hours, on the inside.
That's too long.
The window might be closed by then.
I'm gonna drop in solo.
I don't want you dropping in with nothing but your dick in your hand.
- I appreciate it.
- Here.
Take my cell phone.
(CASE) Now I'm just gonna do lead recon.
I won't shake the tree until the cavalry gets there.
(RICKS) No.
Chase, I don't like it.
Come on, Ricks.
We're probably wrong anyway.
(CASE) At least I can start eliminating possible locations, narrow the options.
Hello?
Excuse me.
Can I borrow these?
Okay, Case, listen to me.
Keep your head down and your mouth shut.
I'm done losing men today.
Me too.
Fuck me.
Ricks, got a visual on the van.
- Case, talk to me.
- Hold on, I'll take a closer look.
Empty.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Wait.
I hear something.
I'll get back to you.
(RINGING CONTINUES)
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
I got Case again for you.
(CASE) Hey, Ricks.
I think I got something for you.
(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
(MAN SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
Trace that voice.
Get that?
Got it.
We've confirmed the buyer is an Iranian operative named Amjad... with ties to the terrorist cell Al-Shabaab.
Amjad will probably take the final shipment of the uranium... but we suspect the final payment will be at Malin's safe house... where she is most likely holding Jay.
- Location?
- Near the old market.
Working the sat right now.
But if she hasn't broken up the payload... there should be enough to nail down the uranium signature.
Case, just observe.
Bravo is close.
They're 20 klicks out.
I gotta keep moving.
He'll lead me to Malin.
I'm not losing Jay.
(PHONE BEEPS)
Case?
(SCOFFS) He's gonna do it.
He's gotta.

The stupid watch doesn't even work.
You don't look very happy, Ben.
Let me give you a hand with that.
I didn't even have to do anything.
All their shots missed the net.
You gave your team a chance to win.
That's what's important.
Important?
Come on, grandpa.
It's just a game.
Nothing in Bellwood is really very important.
I don't know why you're always bad-mouthing Bellwood.
It's a great little town.
I've been here my entire life.
That's just it.
Everybody stays in Bellwood their entire life.
They're born here, grow up here, get old here, with all the exact same people.
Maybe people here are content.
Yeah.
Well, I'm not.
I wish there was something...
I don't know... more.
Believe it or not, I know what you mean, Ben.
But maybe what you're looking for will find you... somehow.
This is a blast from the past.
Gwen.
What are you doing here?
Oh, um, my mom wanted to talk to your mom and grandpa about the family reunion.
Man, I hope they're not gonna have it at that same old campsite grandpa Max made us go to when we were kids.
Ugh.
The start of the most boring road trip of all time.
Don't remind me.
Driving around with our grandpa in his junky old motor home.
Worst summer ever.
I, um...
I heard you were gonna go away to college early.
Well, I was in this program, but, um, it didn't happen.
Bummer.
- Not really.
I got cold feet, so I pulled my application.
Maybe next year.
Yeah.
Um, remember my friend Cash?
He moved to a school across town.
Then he somehow convinced Clem to go with him.
And you really don't know any of these people, so I guess you wouldn't care.
Sorry.
It's okay, Ben.
We don't have to talk.
It's not like we're close or anything.
Hey, J.T.
Yeah.
Yeah, I can meet up with you.
Strange things are afoot at the Mr. Smoothy's.
Hey, if anybody's following me, I just spent my allowance on smoothies, and some dude already stole my watch today.
And now I'm talking to myself.
No.
Now you're talking to yourself.
I wouldn't have believed it if I wasn't seeing it with my own eyes.
It really is you.
That smoothie must have been past its expiration date.
I knew you were going to say that.
Hmm.
Go ahead.
Like looking into a mirror, right?
You're... you're me.
Don't bother stammering in confusion.
I know exactly what you're thinking.
But you have no idea what I'm thinking.
What is the matter with you, dude?
You must be taking the same self-defense classes I did.
I didn't give you enough credit.
Then again, you areBenTennyson.
You can do anything I can do...
Except this.
How did you... what are you?
I've come a long way to find you, Ben Tennyson... to find and end you.
This isn't possible!
- Hardly.
Though I realize none of this makes sense from your point of view.
If I were a nice guy, I would explain why you must be destroyed.
But I am not a nice guy.
Aah!
Help!
Somebody help me!
Cleanup on aisle 10!
Hello, Ben.
- Aah!
Boo.
- Aah!
Aah!
I like this guy.
I almost feel bad for what we have to do him...
Almost.
This fun!
Aah!
Stop running!
Aah!
Aah!
This is one cuckoo-crazy nightmare.
I'm gonna wake up any second.
Why are you doing this to me?
What?
Saving you?
You... you've got one of those weird watches to transform into some crazy monster and try to smash me.
I'm not gonna try to smash you... promise.
Oh, that makes me feel so much safer.
But as for the Monster part...
Aah!
Aah!
Oh, if this is a dream, I'd just like to wake up now, please.
It's just way too complicated for me to explain, but, um...
I'll take you to someone who can.
Aah!
How long do we have to wait?
Hard to say.
Time isn't easy to keep track of.
Nonsense.
Hello, Ben Tennyson.
Tennysons... plural.
We haven't met... well, I have, but you haven't.
Professor Paradox at your service.
Amazing... a universe without an Omnitrix.
It boggles the mind.
Dude, this is not making me less confused.
Fair enough.
But before I can answer any questions, you're going to need to brush up on quantum mechanics and string theory.
There are many dimension, many Universes, many Earths, and thus many Ben Tennysons across those dimensions... dimensions which are not always in sync in time.
Is that all?
I totally get what's going on now.
Think of time and space as this tree.
Down here is when you were 10 years old.
Right here is now.
Up here is when you'll be 30 years old.
The trunk is the main timeline.
These branches represent alternate timelines, where reality literally branches off and becomes a different timeline, each containing its own Ben Tennyson.
Make sense now?
Not even a little bit.
The problem is someone or something is working its way through the branches, kidnapping all the different Bens throughout space and time.
These guys weren't trying to kidnap me.
They were trying to wipe me out.
There is something unusual about you...
or, more specifically, something usual about your wrist.
The other Bens all had that freaky watch.
The Omnitrix.
Every Ben Tennyson throughout space and time has had his fate intertwined with that of the Omnitrix.
You, however, have not.
Hence you are being targeted.
Why me?
I haven't the foggiest, but I'm off to find out.
If someone's traveling in time to kidnap Bens, it has to be Eon.
His tracks are covered too well.
If Eon is involved, someone else is the mastermind.
Keep Ben safe.
I'll protect him like he was my own... me.
Levity and humor...
Excellent.
Get it out of your system now.
If I'm right, there won't be any opportunity for it later.
I'm toast.
What's the deal with these Omnitrix watches that can turn you into super-powered monsters?
Aliens.
I can't tell you too much, but... it's the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.
I always knew there was something more for me out there... something special.
But every Ben Tennyson in every dimension has an Omnitrix...
Except me.
Get down!
You'renottheone I'm looking for, but you are... the one without an Omnitrix.
Difficult to find... easy to finish off.
I knew it had to be you, Eon.
You're not getting him.
Quick!
Find somewhere safe!
Total insanity.
Aah!
Fear me, Ben Tennyson.
Y... you're another me?
I'm sorry.
You must not realize how ridiculous that sounds.
For over a decade, that whelp has prevented me from arming a legion of Omnitrix-clad minions to conquer the universe.
You've been going after him for a decade?
It seems like that whelp is a bit too much for you to handle.
Ahh, as quippy as the other Tennysons, I see.
Don't lump me in with them.
Wait.
You're a me, also?
Eon has merely been helping me collect Ben Tennysons from all throughout the multiverse, whisking them out of their timelines to... mentor them... mold them.
Why settle for the Omnitrix when I could possess the watch and its wearer?
Not just one...
I can control every Omnitrix by controlling every Ben who wields it.
So, what do you want with me?
I don't have an Omnitrix.
See?
Yours is the only timeline without an Omnitrix, which makes it an unpredictable wild card.
And in my future, there is no room for wild cards.
So many evil me's.
- "Evil" is relative.
Not to mention offensive.
I don't care what he calls me.
Lame.
It was a long process, assembling Ben Tennysons from all over the multiverse, but we had plenty of time.
You, however, do not.
Bens smash.
Fourmungousaur!
As an old friend used to say, "it's hero time!"
All right, hater-Bens, get ready to meet Build-a-guy!
Go!
Run!
Hide!
I don't want to run.
I want to help.
We got this.
You can help by not being such an easy target.
Now get clear and keep your head down.
Whoa!
Aah!
Hang on, Ben!
- Aah!
Aah.
You know how weird it feels being rescued by aliens?
You know how weird it feels rescuing myself?
I wish I had an Omnitrix.
I want to be able to do something... anything.
It's just a watch, Ben.
Gadgets don't make the hero.
Without a watch, I have to just... watch?
Well, that's one way of looking at it.
Vilgax, are you just going to stand there, or are you going to join the fight?
I'll do whatever I please, and you are in no position to ever demand otherwise.
Now open the portal.
We're partners in this endeavor.
I should be in on every detail of your plans, especially if they suddenly involve a bomb.
Not just a bomb...
a Chronosapien time bomb.
You're going to destroy this Ben 10 and his timeline?
Nice.
- On the contrary...
The detonation won't even touch this Ben Tennyson or his timeline.
It's designed to wipe other timelinesfromexistence.
Which one?
All of them.
Only this timeline will be left intact, while all others will cease to exist, so every Ben Tennyson not from this timeline will be destroyed.
But I'm an alternate Ben Tennyson not from this timeline.
What... what happens to me?
Thank you for your help, Eon.
Your assistance is no longer required.
Aah!
What is that?
What we do now?
Every Ben for himself!
Atomic X!
Aah!
Aah!
- Aah!
Aah!
Paradox?
What's happening now?
Paradox?
Where's paradox?
I don't know!
He was right here, and then he wasn't.
Uh... aah!
Aah!
- Ben!
It's just a gadget!
Be the hero!
What did you do?
What I had planned to do all along.
The moment I discovered your universe,
I knew I had found the means to rid the multiverse of any Ben Tennyson who had ever even heard of the Omnitrix.
Now you are the only Ben left, and you're no threat to me.
Aah!
But that won't stop me from destroying you, too.
Ahh, there you are.
Run from me for the rest of your life, Ben Tennyson.
For at long last, the Universe is once and truly mine.
Whoa.
Where are...
- No need to ask where we are.
This is not a place, so it's not a question I can answer.
If you think of time and space as a tree with branches...
Not again.
Then you and I are on a leaf that has fallen from it.
Only now there is no longer any tree.
Vilgax chopped it down.
Then he did it.
Vilgax won.
Yes.
You are the last Ben Tennyson.
So, what do we do now?
- The only thing we can do...
Go back to where it all began...
At the beginning.

For over a decade, that whelp has prevented me from arming a legion of Omnitrix-clad minions to conquer the universe.
Ben:
You've been going after him for a decade?
It seems like that whelp is a bit too much for you to handle.
Vilgax:
Ahh, as quippy as the other Tennysons, I see.
[ Snarls ]
Eon:
Don't lump me in with them.
Ben:
Wait.
You're a me, also?
Vilgax:
Eon has merely been helping me collect Ben Tennysons from all throughout the multiverse, whisking them out of their timelines to... mentor them... mold them.
Why settle for the Omnitrix when I could possess the watch and its wearer?
Not just one...
I can control every Omnitrix by controlling every Ben who wields it.
Ben:
So, what do you want with me?
I don't have an Omnitrix.
See?
Eon:
Yours is the only timeline without an Omnitrix, which makes it an unpredictable wild card.
Vilgax:
And in my future, there is no room for wild cards.
Ben:
So many evil me's.
- Bad Ben: "Evil" is relative.
Albedo:
Not to mention offensive.
Mad Ben:
I don't care what he calls me.
Nega Ben: [ Scoffs ]
Lame.
Eon:
It was a long process, assembling Ben Tennysons from all over the multiverse, but we had plenty of time.
Vilgax:
You, however, do not.
Benzarro:
Bens smash.
[ All yelling indistinctly ]
Ben 10,000:

You know how weird it feels being rescued by aliens?
You know how weird it feels rescuing myself?
Ben: [ Sighs ]
I wish I had an Omnitrix.
I want to be able to do something... anything.
It's just a watch, Ben.
Gadgets don't make the hero.
[ Squawks ]
Ben:
Without a watch, I have to just... watch?
Well, that's one way of looking at it.
[ Thudding ]
Eon:
Vilgax, are you just going to stand there, or are you going to join the fight?
Vilgax:
I'll do whatever I please, and you are in no position to ever demand otherwise.
Now open the portal.
Eon:
We're partners in this endeavor.
I should be in on every detail of your plans, especially if they suddenly involve a bomb.
Vilgax:
Not just a bomb...
a Chronosapien time bomb.
[ Bomb ticking ]
Eon:
You're going to destroy this Ben 10 and his timeline?
Nice.
- Vilgax:
On the contrary...
The detonation won't even touch this Ben Tennyson or his timeline.
It's designed to wipe other timelinesfromexistence.
Eon:
Which one?
Vilgax:
All of them.
[ Laughs evilly ]
Only this timeline will be left intact, while all others will cease to exist, so every Ben Tennyson not from this timeline will be destroyed.
Eon:
But I'm an alternate Ben Tennyson not from this timeline.
What... what happens to me?
Vilgax:
Thank you for your help, Eon.
Your assistance is no longer required.

[ Beep ]
Ben prime:
It's just a gadget!
Be the hero!
Ben: [ Gasps ]
[ Grunts ]
What did you do?
Vilgax:
What I had planned to do all along.
The moment I discovered your universe,
I knew I had found the means to rid the multiverse of any Ben Tennyson who had ever even heard of the Omnitrix.
Now you are the only Ben left, and you're no threat to me.
Ben:
Aah!
Vilgax:
But that won't stop me from destroying you, too.
Ahh, there you are.
Vilgax:
Run from me for the rest of your life, Ben Tennyson.
For at long last, the Universe is once and truly mine.
[ Laughing evilly ]
Ben:
Whoa.
Where are...
- No need to ask where we are.
This is not a place, so it's not a question I can answer.
If you think of time and space as a tree with branches...
Ben: [ Groans ] Not again.
Then you and I are on a leaf that has fallen from it.
Only now there is no longer any tree.
Vilgax chopped it down.
Ben:
Then he did it.
Vilgax won.
Yes.
You are the last Ben Tennyson.
Ben:
So, what do we do now?
- The only thing we can do...
Go back to where it all began...
At the beginning.

Tyler Jeffries.
I'm Nicky's mom.
Uh, my-my name's not Tyler.
From Blessed Heart.
You came to our house for Nicky's birthday party last year.
I said I'm not him.
Forget it.
Tyler, are you okay?
Here we go, Erin.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Tyler!
Put him in interrogation.
This one in the radio room.
Cuff the others to something solid.
Don't let them talk to each other or so much as trade glances.
This goes real easy, fellas.
First one to give up Castillo wins the prize.
You get the radio room;
I got the box.
Got it.
GORMLEY:
Reagan, you want help?
No.
I got cops from a dozen precincts volunteering to turn the screws on these guys.
No, we're gonna get a crack at them first.
All right, listen, Steve kept me in the loop on this Castillo.
Says his people are unusually loyal.
Boss of the year?
Great, I'm jealous.
Well, I'm just saying, you might hit a brick wall.
Then I'll drag his family in here.
If you can find them.
Apparently he has a sister, but Castillo made her change her name so nobody could find her and use her against him in some way.
Do you have any more words of encouragement here, Sarge, 'cause this level of optimism is really firing me up.
All right, just-just holler if you need help, all right?
If you hear any hollering, it won't be me.
Open it up.
Hi.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Homework.
Without being asked?
Who are you and what have you done with my daughter?
How was your day?
Weird.
You know that boy from your class, Tyler Jeffries?
Yeah.
What's his story?
Funny.
Super nice.
He's not in my class anymore, though.
He and his mom moved, like, five months ago.
I guess Tyler was getting high and stuff, so his mom put him in boarding school upstate to straighten him out.
Well, I don't think it worked.
What do you mean?
I ran into him today in Hell's Kitchen, and he looked messed up on drugs or homeless or both.
What?
Yeah, it took me a second to even recognize him.
Oh, my God.
But you helped him, right?
Well, he ran off before I could.
Then we got to go find him.
Well, I will call Child Services, and they will contact his mother.
Come on, can we just go look for him?
Relax, all right?
I will handle it.
(scoffs)
Get him out of my face.
Nothing?
Nothing.
None of my guys even so much as asked for a lawyer.
They just sat there smirking at me.
You?
Same.
So what's next?
Pot of coffee.
Yeah, I'll go make one.
Thanks.
GORMLEY:
How's it going?
Don't ask.
Okay, so you want to give me a hand?
I'm kind of busy here, Sarge.
I need a witness to open Steve Tomlin's locker, collect his effects to give to his family.
Okay, I'll get a box.
I always hate this more than the funeral.
A life interrupted and all.
Well, at least there's no bagpipes.
They always make me cry.
It's empty.
I talked to Steve yesterday before he started his tour, Sarge.
His locker was open and it was full.
His uniform was in there, there were papers everywhere and pictures.
Somebody must've cleaned it out after he died.
But before we could find it.
Who the hell's hiding what?
277.
The number of cops lost in the line of duty since you've been on the job.
And now 23 since sitting behind this desk.
You want me to do a draft of your remarks for the service?
You ask me every time, Garrett.
And I'm gonna keep asking.
Some things you can't delegate, even a piece of.
But you could take a look at it when I'm done.
Castillo?
Not yet.
Last night
Sergeant Gormley went to collect Steve Tomlin's things, but somebody got there first.
Locker was completely empty.
Someone sanitized it.
And no way was it a civilian just waltzing in off the street.
GARRETT:
I don't get it.
What's the big deal about a guy's locker?
What's in it.
Or isn't.
Any evidence of tampering goes right up the chain of command.
What, you think Castillo's got a mole in the 5-4?
That's the bad version.
I got a worse one: someone's covering for Tomlin.
We got a problem, Chief.
You sure this is a "we," Frank?
Wouldn't it be better and quieter if the department dealt with this on the precinct level?
No.
Thanks for coming, Uncle Jamie.
Everything okay?
Your text said it was "serious."
Yeah, it's about a friend of mine.
A friend?
No, really, he's a great kid.
Name's Tyler.
He went to my school, but Mom said she saw him in Hell's Kitchen looking like he was on drugs.
Did he use when you knew him?
I know he smoked pot sometimes.
No, I don't.
But if I did, and it'd help find Tyler, then I'd admit it.
So you want me to look for him.
Could you?
Mom said it was around 35th and 10th.
That's a pretty sketchy area.
Yeah, I know.
Here, that's what he looks like.
Your mom know you want me to do this?
Yeah, she's really worried, too.
She would've been here, but she wanted to go talk to Child Services about him.
All right, I'll see what I can do.
Thanks, Uncle Jamie.
And this isn't just me saying it.
This comes straight from the commissioner:
"Someone in the 5-4 cleaned out Steve Tomlin's locker
"without authorization...
"or knows who did.
"Which may very well be impeding the murder investigation
"of a brother in blue to each and every one of you.
"So let me be clear.
"If Detective Tomlin's belongings don't end up
"in my office by 2400 hours, there'll be hell to pay."
For all of us.
So, folks, while the rest of us get back to finding this son of a bitch Castillo, one of you is gonna stand up and do the right thing.
You owe it to Steve.
That's all.
And you two, you got some data to dig through, so get to it.
BAEZ:
So, who do you think it is?
I don't want to believe anybody in this room could be capable of being Castillo's mole.
Well, he found out Tomlin was undercover somehow.
Well, maybe we'll get lucky and find it in all this data we gotta look through.
Well, looks like TARU found a bunch of steamy text messages from one of our thug's cell phones.
Which thug?
Said it belonged to Ticky, the one who was dumping the coke earlier.
I grilled him.
He didn't say squat.
Well, it looks like he had a lot to say when he was sexting this Vivian girl.
Look who he says her brother is.
Castillo.
Son of a bitch.
He was transported down to Central Booking.
Let's get his ass back here now.
Ah, another day of crime-fighting.
We should get capes.
I should get a new partner.
(laughs)
So why did you ask the boss for this sector today?
A favor for my niece and sister.
A friend of Nicky's was in this area the other day looking kind of rough, so I said I'd look for him.
Man, you do more for your family by 9:00 a.m.
than my family's done for each other our entire lives.
Name's Tyler Jeffries, about five-foot-eight, he's 16, he's got blond hair.
I got a picture of him here.
Yo, why do I gotta be back here for?
I still don't got nothing to say.
Why don't you relax, Ticky?
Why do they even call you Ticky, anyway?
Is it because you're a leech on a big fish like Santo Castillo, is that it?
I like watches.
Which is appropriate since your time's running out, unless you tell us where to find your boss.
Yo, like I told you before,
I don't know who you're talking about.
Really?
Even though you're banging his sister... what is, uh, Vivian?
Say what?
Say you right here in these text messages.
"Viv, u were incredible last nite as always."
To which she replied...
"Keep it on the DL, baby.
My bro will kill us if he finds out."
To which you replied...
"U kidding?
Santo heart me.
And I could kick, I could kick his ass anyway."
That's a different Santo.
Hmm.
Really?
Even though Vivian wrote back...
"Santo only hearts his $ and his drugs.
Watch yourself."
To which you replied...
"I only wanna watch u, baby."
Oh, smooth talker, I'll give him that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's just hope he's smooth enough to talk Santo out of blowing his brains out.
Okay, okay!
So I been hooking up with his sister.
Great.
Now you can tell us where she lives.
I can't tell you.
You know one big difference between you and I?
Is that I'm not afraid of your boss, unlike you.
In fact, when I see him,
I'm pretty much gonna tell him that you told us everything.
In fact, maybe I'll even show him this lovely little picture that his sister sent to you.
Please, look, if I give him up, he's gonna have me killed.
Her, too.
Aw...
Which means we're the only ones who can protect you, as long as you start talking.
Yep, so why don't you tell us where she lives?
Now!
Police!
Open up!
You can't just walk in here.
Yeah?
Well, this says we can.
Step aside.
Step aside!
See how easy that works?
Let's go!
Don't touch me!
Come on.
Tear this place apart.
Let's go.
You can't just do that, all right?
I know my rights.
Where's your brother, Vivian?
I don't have one.
Santo Castillo, you're his sister
Dolores, until he made you change your name to Vivian Vasquez.
What are you talking about?
Do you think we're stupid?
He got shot up.
You're a nurse.
Where else would he go?
Maybe to his real sister, 'cause you got the wrong place.
So you all can kiss my ass!
Hey!
Your brother's a cop killer.
And he's going down hard.
And if you're harboring him, you're gonna go down just as hard, you understand?
And I ain't going nowhere 'cause I'm the only one here.
OFFICER:
Hands where I can see 'em!
Is that right?
MAN:
Let me go!
I didn't do nothing!
OFFICER:
Perp in custody!
You were saying?
OFFICER 2:
Come on, come on.
He hid in the tub.
Yeah, real original.
Hope you got clean, Castillo, 'cause that's the last shower you're gonna take by yourself for a long time.
Yeah, and if you think you're in a bad mood now, wait till you find out your sister's screwing the help.
What's he saying?
Santo, I can explain.
You'll explain it to him later.
Get him the hell out of here.
OFFICER 1:
Get him in the hallway.
Take a look at 'em all, Castillo.
Every cop in here wants to take a piece out of you.
Open up.
I want my lawyer.
Won't do you any good.
Next stop for you is a deep, dark hole.
Yeah, and on your way down, you can tell us who helped you set up Steve.
What?
Your mole inside this precinct.
(laughs):
If that's what you think, you ain't never gonna figure out how I found out.
Right.
BAEZ:
Giving up the cop who set up Steve is the only card you've got-- tell your lawyer to play it.
Let's go-
- I want to wash this dirtbag off my hands.
Checking to see if Castillo's gonna give you up, Becker?
You're out of your mind.
What's your problem?
Thought opening lockers was your specialty.
Steve's locker's right behind me.
That gives you plenty of opportunity to scope out his combination, or eavesdrop and see how close he's getting to Castillo.
Listen, Detective...
The only thing I'm listening to, Becker, is you admit to it right now.
Okay, fine, it was me.
I cleaned it out!
You Castillo's mole?
Huh?
No, you got that wrong!
I don't have it wrong.
And if I do, you better tell me why.
Why'd you do it?
!
Hey, beat it!
Both of you, beat it now!
It's none of your damn business.
Start talking, Becker.
I just copped to it, Reagan.
But that's all I got to say.
(sighs quietly)
And you understand the consequences of what you did?
Possible grand larceny, possible criminal possession of stolen property, possible conspiracy in the murder of a police officer.
Yes, sir.
Yet you didn't ask for a lawyer or a union rep.
I don't need one, sir.
It was me who cleaned out Steve Tomlin's locker.
On a cop killer's orders?
I'm no one's mole and I don't know how Steve's cover got blown.
(sighs)
At ease.
Sit down.
What you did doesn't square with your record.
Come on, Bill.
I know you're sitting on something.
Six years ago...
I was still on probation... and me and my training officer heard this bank heist call go over the air.
Steve was already on the scene when we got there, and all of a sudden, these robbers burst out, guns blazing... and...
I froze.
I assume this is going somewhere.
Steve pushed me out of the way before I got my head blown off... and he took down both the perps.
He...
He saved the day.
That night I bought all his drinks and... we became friends.
So you owed him?
What was he mixed up in?
Steve was clean as a whistle, sir.
And-and this has nothing to do with the job.
Then I know he wouldn't want you to blow up your career over this.
(sighs)
He has another family.
(water running)
Wait, so you saw Tyler?
Yeah.
About a block down from where your mom saw him.
He was digging through a trash can.
Was he on drugs?
He didn't look good.
But, you-you took him home, right?
No.
We never got the chance.
He pushed Eddie pretty hard and then he ran.
We went after him, but...
he was gone, just like that.
(sighs) God.
So, he's still out there?
Unfortunately, yeah, but I gave his photo to all the cars in the precinct and I'm gonna ask for the same assignment tomorrow, okay?
ERIN:
Like hell you will.
Mom!
I was just telling Uncle Jamie about...
Yeah.
I heard all about it.
You sent him out looking?
Just let me explain.
JAMIE:
Wait.
What?
I thought you said your mom knew about this?
Would you both just listen to me?
Look, I had to make sure Tyler got help before something bad happened.
So that justifies going behind my back?
And lying to me, Nicky?
I'm sorry.
But maybe if you didn't treat me like I'm still a little kid...
Well, you just proved that you are, by ignoring me when I said I would take care of it.
So, did you?
I spoke to ACS, they've reached out to Tyler's mom, and I haven't heard back yet.
So now he's out there somewhere doing God knows what with God knows who.
The conversation's over.
If you don't eat your vegetables, no dessert.
Delicious, as always.
You hardly ate.
I ate.
Who made the potatoes?
Uh, I think it was Nicky.
Better not say you didn't like 'em.
Loved 'em.
Good and cheesy.
(chuckles)
I'm surprised you found time to cook.
I managed.
Mm-hmm.
We missing something here?
Feeling a little cold chill coming from this side of the table.
What's going on?
Nothing anyone needs to know about.
See, Francis?
Hard enough having even one family some days.
Boys, take your plates and go eat in the kitchen.
So you guys can have a conversation we're not supposed to hear?
That's exactly right, Jack.
Go on.
Come on, I'll eat with you.
Go easy on this, Pop.
I'm not going to pussyfoot around this.
What kind of cop has two families?
What?
Who?
The one that got killed?
Yeah.
Yeah,
Steve Tomlin.
He had a wife and two kids in Staten Island and a girlfriend with a newborn baby in Jersey.
LINDA:
And you didn't know?
Steve is in your squad.
He was in my squad and I'm friendly with him, but pretty much nobody knew what was going on with him.
Well, you know what, one of those women knew what was going on, and it was probably the girlfriend.
So she doesn't deserve any sympathy?
He's the father of her kid.
No, that's not what I'm saying, Jamie.
Maybe he was that good of a catch that they were happy to share him.
(chuckles) (scoffs)
I personally just try to figure out where a man finds the time or energy to carry on with two families.
You-you looking for some tips?
DANNY:
No, I'm not looking for tips.
I'm just saying it's a mess.
Which isn't over.
Right, the funeral.
Well, you can count me out.
And we will.
Oh, come on, Grandpa.
We don't really know what was going on with Tomlin's life.
I mean, maybe he was making the best of a bad situation, you know?
You saying you excuse what he did?
No, I'm just saying I'm reserving judgment until the smoke clears a little.
Exactly.
I got personal items for two different women.
Some need to go to the girlfriend.
Mmm, kind of got to side with Gramps on this one.
Thank you.
There's a line, and men know where it's drawn.
You're also the cop on the case.
Well, then I'll deliver whatever I need to.
Thank you, Danny.
You got it, Dad.
(siren chirping)
Guess what sector we got this morning.
Judging by the smile on your face, Restaurant Row.
Back to Hell's Kitchen.
Really?
Boss says we did great.
15 summonses and a felony collar.
And I volunteered us since I know you want to find Tyler again.
Says who?
Your niece put you on the case.
Yeah, until my sister blew a gasket.
Sergeant.
Come on, friend of Nicky's or not, that kid needs help.
So let's go find him again.
But he's not gonna be hanging around Hell's Kitchen.
Not after he knows we're looking for him.
Yeah, I thought the same thing till I talked to a couple of guys in Narcotics who executed a warrant on a drug spot on that very same block this morning.
And guess who was seen running from the scene.
Well, let's go look for Tyler.
I knew I loved him from the moment we met.
He moved me here,
(baby cries) and pretty soon she was on the way.
And now it's just us two.
I'm sorry it took so long, with all the... issues around Steve.
Issues?
Did Steve stay home every night?
No, he was undercover.
Had to be gone a lot.
Did he wear a ring?
No, why would he?
He was single.
Detective, what-what are you saying?
I'm saying that Steve Tomlin was married.
No.
He had two kids.
Both in their 20s.
No.
You're wrong.
He w... he was with me.
We were going to get married, just-just as soon as-as... as soon as...
I'm sorry.
Regardless of whether or not he was married, it's obvious that he loved you.
(scoffs) You're defending him?
Surprises me, too.
Look, Steve could have abandoned the both of you, but he didn't.
In fact, you should probably take a look at this.
It was in his locker, too.
"Deferred compensation."
Kind of like a pension.
Cop gets to choose who the beneficiaries are, and Steve chose the both of you.
So Angela will be taken care of?
I'm not sure if he filed it.
But it's obvious that he wanted the both of you to be taken care of.
Do you think...
he would've done that if he didn't love you very much?
Tyler Jeffries?
Police!
(panting):
Stop!
Hold it right there.
Let me go.
Please.
Please let me go.
Please.
Why?
So you can go get high again?
Aw, sorry, buddy, those days are over.
Yeah.
Along with shoving police officers, which, by the way, is assault.
Hey.
We tried this the easy way.
Now you get the hard way.
You got anything sharp in your pockets, like a needle?
Anything that's gonna stick me?
Look, I-I don't do drugs.
Yeah, that's not what my niece says.
Look, I, I was a screwup at school, okay?
But I stopped all that.
I swear.
Yeah?
What were you passing around with your pals back there?
Your report card with all As?
Huh?
It was... it was her photo.
To see if anyone's seen her.
"Her" who, huh?
Whoa, whoa.
It's just a picture.
My mom... came down here a week ago to score and never came back home.
She's the junkie.
Thanks for bringing these.
The girls'll be happy to know their father kept them so close.
(sighs)
I'm just trying to carry out what...
I think he'd want.
Steve was a hell of a cop, and I honor that.
It's all he ever wanted to be.
Well, I'll be sure and say that when I stand up for him at the funeral.
And if there's anything else my department can do...
I only have to ask.
Can I ask this?
Could you please not lie to me, Commissioner?
Steve's lies were bad enough, but to have all of you parade around here with your sad smiles and your pats on the back for the poor widow... and nobody has the guts to admit what I've known for the past year?
I'm not sure I understand.
(short laugh) Of course.
Once I knew, I did what every good wife does.
Blamed myself.
Tried to make him love me again.
I mean, I...
I do love the guy.
And the only time I lost it was when I...
I'd had too much to drink and I...
I found his phone and I called the number I didn't recognize and I told the bitch off.
Told her I was the one who had stuck by him all these years and raised his family while he was out on the job.
And I hung up the phone before she could get a word in edgewise.
(sighs)
I'm very sorry.
You know what you could do?
Skip Steve's funeral.
Just skip the nice speech about how honor is such a big part of the job.
How the NYPD appreciates the sacrifices made by the families.
You might be able to get the words out, but I, for one, don't want to hear them.
His real family doesn't want to hear it.
Can you do that for me?
Good-bye, Commissioner.
(door opens)
Frank.
I've got good news.
I could use some.
Corporation counsel reviewed Steve Tomlin's financials.
He filled out his deferred compensation papers but never submitted them, so they're invalid.
The Staten Island family will get all the money and benefits.
And how is that good news?
Well, the last thing this office needs is legal wrangling with an irate widow.
Or lurid headlines about a two-timing cop.
So it's good news for this office?
What about Marianna and their baby?
Well, technically, they're not his family.
Technically?
I don't blame them.
Doesn't take a ring to make a family.
I tried to give you an out, Frank.
But you chose to be mixed up in this.
I'm just telling you where we are.
On the high moral ground, apparently.
That's not fair.
None of this is.
That's no excuse to turn our backs on a woman with a cop's baby.
Look, if you can fire a way to help out both families, I'm all ears.
As far as I see it, the department's hands are tied.
You really sure I should be here?
I called your mom to ask her, but she didn't answer, so...
No, I mean because I lied to you.
We're good, Nicky.
And I think that Tyler could really use a friend right about now.
Tyler.
Oh, my God,
I thought you moved.
That's what I told everyone.
So they wouldn't know the truth.
Tyler's mom has been having some problems.
What do you mean?
First it was prescription drugs.
Then it became other stuff.
Ms. Jeffries disappeared about a week ago.
Tyler's been out looking for her.
Why didn't you let my mom help you?
Or my uncle?
Because then you'd find out, and... people at school.
(short laugh) But...
I guess they'll all find out anyway when it's in the papers that she's dead.
Tyler, we don't know that she is.
Then why can't I find her?
I've looked everywhere.
Because she's been in the hospital.
Accidental OD.
She's been a Jane Doe at Bellevue for a couple days.
Is there any way I can see her?
That's why I'm here.
So you did keep looking for her.
And your uncle is on his way down from Rhode Island.
You'll stay with him until your mom gets clean.
Thank you so much.
All of you.
We just did what she asked.
Come on.
I want a cape.
Ah.
(chuckles)
Cheers.
(exhales)
Yeah.
I need a little help here, Pop.
Is this about that Tomlin fellow?
His second family needs to be taken care of.
Wasn't that his job?
Well, he got himself killed in the line of duty before he got around to it.
So throw him a 10-13 party.
There is a three-month-old baby girl who's gonna grow up without a father.
And the problem does not get solved by some cash in a cigar box on a bar.
(door shuts)
DANNY:
Where is everyone?
In here.
HENRY (chuckling):
Oh.
Are you here to help your old man muscle me into pitching in?
If that's what's going on, I am now.
Come on, Pop.
You're on the board of the Policeman's Fund.
Yeah, so?
So it may be time to put some of that influence to good use, Gramps.
Create a back-pocket pension for one more widow and orphan.
Old dog, new tricks.
I haven't said yes.
You gonna say no?
(slow grunt)
So what's going on?
I went to see the girlfriend again to confirm that Tomlin's wife did in fact call her as she claimed.
Wait a minute.
The wife called the girlfriend?
The wife thought she called the girlfriend.
She found a number in Tomlin's cell phone.
She called it, thinking it would be the girlfriend on the other end.
Tomlin was undercover in Castillo's gang.
And unfortunately... (sighs)
She accidentally called one of them.
Yeah.
It was Tomlin's wife who blew his cover, Gramps.
Couple days later, we got a dead cop.
You got to be kidding me.
If I was kidding, someone would be laughing.
HENRY:
Good Lord.
She loses her husband and then has to hear this.
It'll kill the woman.
Unless she doesn't hear it.
I can't lie to that woman again.
She has to know.
Commissioner Reagan.
I need to talk to you, Mrs. Tomlin.
I've said everything I have to say.
Well,
I'm afraid I haven't.
I'm sorry, I got nothing for nobody.
I'm burying my husband tomorrow.
I didn't handle our meeting very well, yesterday, and I'm sorry.
But I think... (deep breath)
Steve would've wanted the NYPD represented at his service.
I know he would.
And it would be my honor to do that for him.
You came all the way out here just to ask me that?
Yes, I did.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Isn't this place charming?
As advertised, but you didn't invite me here for the charm or the ice cream.
We can't just have ice cream?
We can, but not in this instance.
Better chance of being hit by lightning.
Okay, I have a problem.
Well, first of all, your mom's got a lot on her plate, and I think she's doing an outstanding job considering...
It's not about Mom.
Oh.
It's about my teacher.
It's like she's made it her mission in life to keep me from ever graduating.
Turn that thing off.
But what if it's important?
Choose.
Look, here's the problem.
She's notorious for being harder on the girls, but when she found out I was from a family of cops...
Look, I should really check it.
Choose.
Grandpa...
How would you feel if I was constantly interrupting?
Deputy Commissioner Moore just walked in.
Hold that thought.
A cop's been shot.
Who and where?
North End bus yard, multiple precincts rolled, but radio chatter's not clear on a name, how bad they're hit.
We've got conflicting descriptions of perps and direction of flight.
Tell me something we do know.
Whoever's down is a detective out of Danny's precinct.
This is Detective Reagan.
Leave a message.
Hey, Danny, it's me;
give me a call.
Let me know everything's okay.
Hey, voice mail again?
Yeah, third time.
You heard anything new?
Lady called 911, said she was out walking her dog, heard yelling from behind a fence.
Someone being accused of being a cop.
Shots fired.
There's still no name?
Only that he was rushed to St. Benjamin's.
A couple of guys are headed over.
All right, I'm gonna ask the boss if we can, too, just in case, all right?
Okay, come on, there's got to be 15 detectives in the 5-4 squad.
Odds are it isn't your brother.
Danny's wife.
No way she's heard anything.
Unless she got the call.
Hey, Linda.
Jamie, it's not Danny.
He called you?
Yeah, in case I heard, but he's fine.
He's working a case in Murray Hill, and he said he was gonna call your dad as soon as he hung up with me.
Thank God.
Yeah, no kidding.
Listen...
Hi, Mom!
Awesome!
Yeah, I'm picking the boys up right now, so could you call Erin and Henry?
You know, make sure they're not worried, too.
Yeah, they already are.
Thanks, Linda.
I'm glad it wasn't Danny.
There, I said it.
I felt the same way.
Danny's family.
Steve Tomlin has one, too.
Let's hope for the best.
Dino says
Steve has been undercover for the last year, working his way up the chain of a drug operation run by Santo Castillo.
Somebody made him.
Word is, after Castillo shot him,
Steve managed to put a slug in Castillo, who ran off.
Tough cop.
Gave him the Combat Cross in '09.
Commissioner?
How's my officer?
Um, I'm afraid he's gone.
Three bullets, one through the carotid.
He lost too much blood by the time he arrived.
Thank you, Doctor.
I'll need to talk to his wife.
Lorraine.
Married to Steve for 22 years, tax accountant by trade.
They have a home in Staten Island.
Frank, she's here.
Two daughters, Bella and Lucy, both in college.
Mrs. Tomlin?
I'm so sorry.
Can I arrange to get Lucy and Bella home from school?
Oh, that, uh...
Uh, yes.
Um, thank you.
My department owes Steve a deep debt of gratitude for his years of service.
Anything we can do to help, you only need to ask.
Catch whoever murdered my husband.
We will do that.

Tell me we got the son of a bitch.
Wish I could.
That's not the answer I want to hear, Dino.
Yes, sir.
Morning, Baker.
Morning, sir.
Castillo was shot.
That would've slowed him down.
He hasn't turned up in any E.R. in the tri-state.
I've got the whole department out looking.
Half of them are doing it on their own time.
Who'd you put with the family?
Johnson and Garcia.
They came up in the ranks together.
And on the case?
Sergeant Gormley said he gave it to the best detective he's got.
On the ground!
Get on the ground!
Move it!
Back away from that sink!
On the ground now!
Turn around, get on the ground, put your hands behind your head!
Where's your boss?
Who?
You heard me.
Castillo.
Yo, we're just cleaning crew.
Yeah?
My cleaning lady keeps a bazooka, too.
Still enough here to send you down the drain.
What's your name?
Ticky.
Ticky, you want a break?
Give up the cop killer.
Like he said, we don't know anything.
Fine, you want to play stupid with me, get your hands up on the sink.
Move!
I got all the time in the world till you decide to wise up.
As far as I'm concerned, each one of you pulled the trigger on Steve Tomlin.
You're all coming for a ride;
let's go.
Get them out of here.
Erin, that was impressive.
Well, sometimes when you get the right witness, the whole case will fall into place.
Well, I'll get her statement typed up and to the DA by lunch.
Great.
Can you find the car?
Lady, can you give me some help?
Sorry, I don't have any change.
I mean a different kind of help.
Tyler?
What?
Tyler Jeffries.
I'm Nicky's mom.
Uh, my-my name's not Tyler.
From Blessed Heart.
You came to our house for Nicky's birthday party last year.
I said I'm not him.
Forget it.
Tyler, are you okay?
Here we go, Erin.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Tyler!
Put him in interrogation.
This one in the radio room.
Cuff the others to something solid.
Don't let them talk to each other or so much as trade glances.
This goes real easy, fellas.
First one to give up Castillo wins the prize.
You get the radio room;
I got the box.
Got it.
Reagan, you want help?
No.
I got cops from a dozen precincts volunteering to turn the screws on these guys.
No, we're gonna get a crack at them first.
All right, listen, Steve kept me in the loop on this Castillo.
Says his people are unusually loyal.
Boss of the year?
Great, I'm jealous.
Well, I'm just saying, you might hit a brick wall.
Then I'll drag his family in here.
If you can find them.
Apparently he has a sister, but Castillo made her change her name so nobody could find her and use her against him in some way.
Do you have any more words of encouragement here, Sarge, 'cause this level of optimism is really firing me up.
All right, just-just holler if you need help, all right?
If you hear any hollering, it won't be me.
Open it up.
Hi.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Homework.
Without being asked?
Who are you and what have you done with my daughter?
How was your day?
Weird.
You know that boy from your class, Tyler Jeffries?
Yeah.
What's his story?
Funny.
Super nice.
He's not in my class anymore, though.
He and his mom moved, like, five months ago.
I guess Tyler was getting high and stuff, so his mom put him in boarding school upstate to straighten him out.
Well, I don't think it worked.
What do you mean?
I ran into him today in Hell's Kitchen, and he looked messed up on drugs or homeless or both.
What?
Yeah, it took me a second to even recognize him.
Oh, my God.
But you helped him, right?
Well, he ran off before I could.
Then we got to go find him.
Well, I will call Child Services, and they will contact his mother.
Come on, can we just go look for him?
Relax, all right?
I will handle it.
Get him out of my face.
Nothing?
Nothing.
None of my guys even so much as asked for a lawyer.
They just sat there smirking at me.
You?
Same.
So what's next?
Pot of coffee.
Yeah, I'll go make one.
Thanks.
How's it going?
Don't ask.
Okay, so you want to give me a hand?
I'm kind of busy here, Sarge.
I need a witness to open Steve Tomlin's locker, collect his effects to give to his family.
Okay, I'll get a box.
I always hate this more than the funeral.
A life interrupted and all.
Well, at least there's no bagpipes.
They always make me cry.
It's empty.
I talked to Steve yesterday before he started his tour, Sarge.
His locker was open and it was full.
His uniform was in there, there were papers everywhere and pictures.
Somebody must've cleaned it out after he died.
But before we could find it.
Who the hell's hiding what?
277.
The number of cops lost in the line of duty since you've been on the job.
And now 23 since sitting behind this desk.
You want me to do a draft of your remarks for the service?
You ask me every time, Garrett.
And I'm gonna keep asking.
Some things you can't delegate, even a piece of.
But you could take a look at it when I'm done.
Castillo?
Not yet.
Last night
Sergeant Gormley went to collect Steve Tomlin's things, but somebody got there first.
Locker was completely empty.
Someone sanitized it.
And no way was it a civilian just waltzing in off the street.
I don't get it.
What's the big deal about a guy's locker?
What's in it.
Or isn't.
Any evidence of tampering goes right up the chain of command.
What, you think Castillo's got a mole in the 5-4?
That's the bad version.
I got a worse one: someone's covering for Tomlin.
We got a problem, Chief.
You sure this is a "we," Frank?
Wouldn't it be better and quieter if the department dealt with this on the precinct level?
No.
Thanks for coming, Uncle Jamie.
Everything okay?
Your text said it was "serious."
Yeah, it's about a friend of mine.
A friend?
No, really, he's a great kid.
Name's Tyler.
He went to my school, but Mom said she saw him in Hell's Kitchen looking like he was on drugs.
Did he use when you knew him?
I know he smoked pot sometimes.
No, I don't.
But if I did, and it'd help find Tyler, then I'd admit it.
So you want me to look for him.
Could you?
Mom said it was around 35th and 10th.
That's a pretty sketchy area.
Yeah, I know.
Here, that's what he looks like.
Your mom know you want me to do this?
Yeah, she's really worried, too.
She would've been here, but she wanted to go talk to Child Services about him.
All right, I'll see what I can do.
Thanks, Uncle Jamie.
And this isn't just me saying it.
This comes straight from the commissioner:
"Someone in the 5-4 cleaned out Steve Tomlin's locker
"without authorization...
"or knows who did.
"Which may very well be impeding the murder investigation
"of a brother in blue to each and every one of you.
"So let me be clear.
"If Detective Tomlin's belongings don't end up
"in my office by 2400 hours, there'll be hell to pay."
For all of us.
So, folks, while the rest of us get back to finding this son of a bitch Castillo, one of you is gonna stand up and do the right thing.
You owe it to Steve.
That's all.
And you two, you got some data to dig through, so get to it.
So, who do you think it is?
I don't want to believe anybody in this room could be capable of being Castillo's mole.
Well, he found out Tomlin was undercover somehow.
Well, maybe we'll get lucky and find it in all this data we gotta look through.
Well, looks like TARU found a bunch of steamy text messages from one of our thug's cell phones.
Which thug?
Said it belonged to Ticky, the one who was dumping the coke earlier.
I grilled him.
He didn't say squat.
Well, it looks like he had a lot to say when he was sexting this Vivian girl.
Look who he says her brother is.
Castillo.
Son of a bitch.
He was transported down to Central Booking.
Let's get his ass back here now.
Ah, another day of crime-fighting.
We should get capes.
I should get a new partner.
So why did you ask the boss for this sector today?
A favor for my niece and sister.
A friend of Nicky's was in this area the other day looking kind of rough, so I said I'd look for him.
Man, you do more for your family by 9:00 a.m.
than my family's done for each other our entire lives.
Name's Tyler Jeffries, about five-foot-eight, he's 16, he's got blond hair.
I got a picture of him here.
Yo, why do I gotta be back here for?
I still don't got nothing to say.
Why don't you relax, Ticky?
Why do they even call you Ticky, anyway?
Is it because you're a leech on a big fish like Santo Castillo, is that it?
I like watches.
Which is appropriate since your time's running out, unless you tell us where to find your boss.
Yo, like I told you before,
I don't know who you're talking about.
Really?
Even though you're banging his sister... what is, uh, Vivian?
Say what?
Say you right here in these text messages.
"Viv, u were incredible last nite as always."
To which she replied...
"Keep it on the DL, baby.
My bro will kill us if he finds out."
To which you replied...
"U kidding?
Santo heart me.
And I could kick, I could kick his ass anyway."
That's a different Santo.
Hmm.
Really?
Even though Vivian wrote back...
"Santo only hearts his $ and his drugs.
Watch yourself."
To which you replied...
"I only wanna watch u, baby."
Oh, smooth talker, I'll give him that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's just hope he's smooth enough to talk Santo out of blowing his brains out.
Okay, okay!
So I been hooking up with his sister.
Great.
Now you can tell us where she lives.
I can't tell you.
You know one big difference between you and I?
Is that I'm not afraid of your boss, unlike you.
In fact, when I see him,
I'm pretty much gonna tell him that you told us everything.
In fact, maybe I'll even show him this lovely little picture that his sister sent to you.
Please, look, if I give him up, he's gonna have me killed.
Her, too.
Aw...
Which means we're the only ones who can protect you, as long as you start talking.
Yep, so why don't you tell us where she lives?
Now!
Police!
Open up!
You can't just walk in here.
Yeah?
Well, this says we can.
Step aside.
Step aside!
See how easy that works?
Let's go!
Don't touch me!
Come on.
Tear this place apart.
Let's go.
You can't just do that, all right?
I know my rights.
Where's your brother, Vivian?
I don't have one.
Santo Castillo, you're his sister
Dolores, until he made you change your name to Vivian Vasquez.
What are you talking about?
Do you think we're stupid?
He got shot up.
You're a nurse.
Where else would he go?
Maybe to his real sister, 'cause you got the wrong place.
So you all can kiss my ass!
Hey!
Your brother's a cop killer.
And he's going down hard.
And if you're harboring him, you're gonna go down just as hard, you understand?
And I ain't going nowhere 'cause I'm the only one here.
Hands where I can see 'em!
Is that right?
Let me go!
I didn't do nothing!
Perp in custody!
You were saying?
Come on, come on.
He hid in the tub.
Yeah, real original.
Hope you got clean, Castillo, 'cause that's the last shower you're gonna take by yourself for a long time.
Yeah, and if you think you're in a bad mood now, wait till you find out your sister's screwing the help.
What's he saying?
Santo, I can explain.
You'll explain it to him later.
Get him the hell out of here.
Get him in the hallway.
Take a look at 'em all, Castillo.
Every cop in here wants to take a piece out of you.
Open up.
I want my lawyer.
Won't do you any good.
Next stop for you is a deep, dark hole.
Yeah, and on your way down, you can tell us who helped you set up Steve.
What?
Your mole inside this precinct.
If that's what you think, you ain't never gonna figure out how I found out.
Right.
Giving up the cop who set up Steve is the only card you've got-- tell your lawyer to play it.
Let's go-
- I want to wash this dirtbag off my hands.
Checking to see if Castillo's gonna give you up, Becker?
You're out of your mind.
What's your problem?
Thought opening lockers was your specialty.
Steve's locker's right behind me.
That gives you plenty of opportunity to scope out his combination, or eavesdrop and see how close he's getting to Castillo.
Listen, Detective...
The only thing I'm listening to, Becker, is you admit to it right now.
Okay, fine, it was me.
I cleaned it out!
You Castillo's mole?
Huh?
No, you got that wrong!
I don't have it wrong.
And if I do, you better tell me why.
Why'd you do it?
!
Hey, beat it!
Both of you, beat it now!
It's none of your damn business.
Start talking, Becker.
I just copped to it, Reagan.
But that's all I got to say.
And you understand the consequences of what you did?
Possible grand larceny, possible criminal possession of stolen property, possible conspiracy in the murder of a police officer.
Yes, sir.
Yet you didn't ask for a lawyer or a union rep.
I don't need one, sir.
It was me who cleaned out Steve Tomlin's locker.
On a cop killer's orders?
I'm no one's mole and I don't know how Steve's cover got blown.
At ease.
Sit down.
What you did doesn't square with your record.
Come on, Bill.
I know you're sitting on something.
Six years ago...
I was still on probation... and me and my training officer heard this bank heist call go over the air.
Steve was already on the scene when we got there, and all of a sudden, these robbers burst out, guns blazing... and...
I froze.
I assume this is going somewhere.
Steve pushed me out of the way before I got my head blown off... and he took down both the perps.
He...
He saved the day.
That night I bought all his drinks and... we became friends.
So you owed him?
What was he mixed up in?
Steve was clean as a whistle, sir.
And-and this has nothing to do with the job.
Then I know he wouldn't want you to blow up your career over this.
He has another family.
Wait, so you saw Tyler?
Yeah.
About a block down from where your mom saw him.
He was digging through a trash can.
Was he on drugs?
He didn't look good.
But, you-you took him home, right?
No.
We never got the chance.
He pushed Eddie pretty hard and then he ran.
We went after him, but...
he was gone, just like that.
God.
So, he's still out there?
Unfortunately, yeah, but I gave his photo to all the cars in the precinct and I'm gonna ask for the same assignment tomorrow, okay?
Like hell you will.
Mom!
I was just telling Uncle Jamie about...
Yeah.
I heard all about it.
You sent him out looking?
Just let me explain.
Wait.
What?
I thought you said your mom knew about this?
Would you both just listen to me?
Look, I had to make sure Tyler got help before something bad happened.
So that justifies going behind my back?
And lying to me, Nicky?
I'm sorry.
But maybe if you didn't treat me like I'm still a little kid...
Well, you just proved that you are, by ignoring me when I said I would take care of it.
So, did you?
I spoke to ACS, they've reached out to Tyler's mom, and I haven't heard back yet.
So now he's out there somewhere doing God knows what with God knows who.
The conversation's over.
If you don't eat your vegetables, no dessert.
Delicious, as always.
You hardly ate.
I ate.
Who made the potatoes?
Uh, I think it was Nicky.
Better not say you didn't like 'em.
Loved 'em.
Good and cheesy.
I'm surprised you found time to cook.
I managed.
Mm-hmm.
We missing something here?
Feeling a little cold chill coming from this side of the table.
What's going on?
Nothing anyone needs to know about.
See, Francis?
Hard enough having even one family some days.
Boys, take your plates and go eat in the kitchen.
So you guys can have a conversation we're not supposed to hear?
That's exactly right, Jack.
Go on.
Come on, I'll eat with you.
Go easy on this, Pop.
I'm not going to pussyfoot around this.
What kind of cop has two families?
What?
Who?
The one that got killed?
Yeah.
Yeah,
Steve Tomlin.
He had a wife and two kids in Staten Island and a girlfriend with a newborn baby in Jersey.
And you didn't know?
Steve is in your squad.
He was in my squad and I'm friendly with him, but pretty much nobody knew what was going on with him.
Well, you know what, one of those women knew what was going on, and it was probably the girlfriend.
So she doesn't deserve any sympathy?
He's the father of her kid.
No, that's not what I'm saying, Jamie.
Maybe he was that good of a catch that they were happy to share him.
I personally just try to figure out where a man finds the time or energy to carry on with two families.
You-you looking for some tips?
No, I'm not looking for tips.
I'm just saying it's a mess.
Which isn't over.
Right, the funeral.
Well, you can count me out.
And we will.
Oh, come on, Grandpa.
We don't really know what was going on with Tomlin's life.
I mean, maybe he was making the best of a bad situation, you know?
You saying you excuse what he did?
No, I'm just saying I'm reserving judgment until the smoke clears a little.
Exactly.
I got personal items for two different women.
Some need to go to the girlfriend.
Mmm, kind of got to side with Gramps on this one.
Thank you.
There's a line, and men know where it's drawn.
You're also the cop on the case.
Well, then I'll deliver whatever I need to.
Thank you, Danny.
You got it, Dad.
Guess what sector we got this morning.
Judging by the smile on your face, Restaurant Row.
Back to Hell's Kitchen.
Really?
Boss says we did great.
15 summonses and a felony collar.
And I volunteered us since I know you want to find Tyler again.
Says who?
Your niece put you on the case.
Yeah, until my sister blew a gasket.
Sergeant.
Come on, friend of Nicky's or not, that kid needs help.
So let's go find him again.
But he's not gonna be hanging around Hell's Kitchen.
Not after he knows we're looking for him.
Yeah, I thought the same thing till I talked to a couple of guys in Narcotics who executed a warrant on a drug spot on that very same block this morning.
And guess who was seen running from the scene.
Well, let's go look for Tyler.
I knew I loved him from the moment we met.
He moved me here, and pretty soon she was on the way.
And now it's just us two.
I'm sorry it took so long, with all the... issues around Steve.
Issues?
Did Steve stay home every night?
No, he was undercover.
Had to be gone a lot.
Did he wear a ring?
No, why would he?
He was single.
Detective, what-what are you saying?
I'm saying that Steve Tomlin was married.
No.
He had two kids.
Both in their 20s.
No.
You're wrong.
He w... he was with me.
We were going to get married, just-just as soon as-as... as soon as...
I'm sorry.
Regardless of whether or not he was married, it's obvious that he loved you.
You're defending him?
Surprises me, too.
Look, Steve could have abandoned the both of you, but he didn't.
In fact, you should probably take a look at this.
It was in his locker, too.
"Deferred compensation."
Kind of like a pension.
Cop gets to choose who the beneficiaries are, and Steve chose the both of you.
So Angela will be taken care of?
I'm not sure if he filed it.
But it's obvious that he wanted the both of you to be taken care of.
Do you think...
he would've done that if he didn't love you very much?
Tyler Jeffries?
Police!
Stop!
Hold it right there.
Let me go.
Please.
Please let me go.
Please.
Why?
So you can go get high again?
Aw, sorry, buddy, those days are over.
Yeah.
Along with shoving police officers, which, by the way, is assault.
Hey.
We tried this the easy way.
Now you get the hard way.
You got anything sharp in your pockets, like a needle?
Anything that's gonna stick me?
Look, I-I don't do drugs.
Yeah, that's not what my niece says.
Look, I, I was a screwup at school, okay?
But I stopped all that.
I swear.
Yeah?
What were you passing around with your pals back there?
Your report card with all As?
Huh?
It was... it was her photo.
To see if anyone's seen her.
"Her" who, huh?
Whoa, whoa.
It's just a picture.
My mom... came down here a week ago to score and never came back home.
She's the junkie.
Thanks for bringing these.
The girls'll be happy to know their father kept them so close.
I'm just trying to carry out what...
I think he'd want.
Steve was a hell of a cop, and I honor that.
It's all he ever wanted to be.
Well, I'll be sure and say that when I stand up for him at the funeral.
And if there's anything else my department can do...
I only have to ask.
Can I ask this?
Could you please not lie to me, Commissioner?
Steve's lies were bad enough, but to have all of you parade around here with your sad smiles and your pats on the back for the poor widow... and nobody has the guts to admit what I've known for the past year?
I'm not sure I understand.
Of course.
Once I knew, I did what every good wife does.
Blamed myself.
Tried to make him love me again.
I mean, I...
I do love the guy.
And the only time I lost it was when I...
I'd had too much to drink and I...
I found his phone and I called the number I didn't recognize and I told the bitch off.
Told her I was the one who had stuck by him all these years and raised his family while he was out on the job.
And I hung up the phone before she could get a word in edgewise.
I'm very sorry.
You know what you could do?
Skip Steve's funeral.
Just skip the nice speech about how honor is such a big part of the job.
How the NYPD appreciates the sacrifices made by the families.
You might be able to get the words out, but I, for one, don't want to hear them.
His real family doesn't want to hear it.
Can you do that for me?
Good-bye, Commissioner.
Frank.
I've got good news.
I could use some.
Corporation counsel reviewed Steve Tomlin's financials.
He filled out his deferred compensation papers but never submitted them, so they're invalid.
The Staten Island family will get all the money and benefits.
And how is that good news?
Well, the last thing this office needs is legal wrangling with an irate widow.
Or lurid headlines about a two-timing cop.
So it's good news for this office?
What about Marianna and their baby?
Well, technically, they're not his family.
Technically?
I don't blame them.
Doesn't take a ring to make a family.
I tried to give you an out, Frank.
But you chose to be mixed up in this.
I'm just telling you where we are.
On the high moral ground, apparently.
That's not fair.
None of this is.
That's no excuse to turn our backs on a woman with a cop's baby.
Look, if you can fire a way to help out both families, I'm all ears.
As far as I see it, the department's hands are tied.
You really sure I should be here?
I called your mom to ask her, but she didn't answer, so...
No, I mean because I lied to you.
We're good, Nicky.
And I think that Tyler could really use a friend right about now.
Tyler.
Oh, my God,
I thought you moved.
That's what I told everyone.
So they wouldn't know the truth.
Tyler's mom has been having some problems.
What do you mean?
First it was prescription drugs.
Then it became other stuff.
Ms. Jeffries disappeared about a week ago.
Tyler's been out looking for her.
Why didn't you let my mom help you?
Or my uncle?
Because then you'd find out, and... people at school.
But...
I guess they'll all find out anyway when it's in the papers that she's dead.
Tyler, we don't know that she is.
Then why can't I find her?
I've looked everywhere.
Because she's been in the hospital.
Accidental OD.
She's been a Jane Doe at Bellevue for a couple days.
Is there any way I can see her?
That's why I'm here.
So you did keep looking for her.
And your uncle is on his way down from Rhode Island.
You'll stay with him until your mom gets clean.
Thank you so much.
All of you.
We just did what she asked.
Come on.
I want a cape.
Ah.
Cheers.
Yeah.
I need a little help here, Pop.
Is this about that Tomlin fellow?
His second family needs to be taken care of.
Wasn't that his job?
Well, he got himself killed in the line of duty before he got around to it.
So throw him a 10-13 party.
There is a three-month-old baby girl who's gonna grow up without a father.
And the problem does not get solved by some cash in a cigar box on a bar.
Where is everyone?
In here.
Oh.
Are you here to help your old man muscle me into pitching in?
If that's what's going on, I am now.
Come on, Pop.
You're on the board of the Policeman's Fund.
Yeah, so?
So it may be time to put some of that influence to good use, Gramps.
Create a back-pocket pension for one more widow and orphan.
Old dog, new tricks.
I haven't said yes.
You gonna say no?
So what's going on?
I went to see the girlfriend again to confirm that Tomlin's wife did in fact call her as she claimed.
Wait a minute.
The wife called the girlfriend?
The wife thought she called the girlfriend.
She found a number in Tomlin's cell phone.
She called it, thinking it would be the girlfriend on the other end.
Tomlin was undercover in Castillo's gang.
And unfortunately...
She accidentally called one of them.
Yeah.
It was Tomlin's wife who blew his cover, Gramps.
Couple days later, we got a dead cop.
You got to be kidding me.
If I was kidding, someone would be laughing.
Good Lord.
She loses her husband and then has to hear this.
It'll kill the woman.
Unless she doesn't hear it.
I can't lie to that woman again.
She has to know.
Commissioner Reagan.
I need to talk to you, Mrs. Tomlin.
I've said everything I have to say.
Well,
I'm afraid I haven't.
I'm sorry, I got nothing for nobody.
I'm burying my husband tomorrow.
I didn't handle our meeting very well, yesterday, and I'm sorry.
But I think...
Steve would've wanted the NYPD represented at his service.
I know he would.
And it would be my honor to do that for him.
You came all the way out here just to ask me that?
Yes, I did.

Isn't this place charming?
As advertised, but you didn't invite me here for the charm or the ice cream.
We can't just have ice cream?
We can, but not in this instance.
Better chance of being hit by lightning.
Okay, I have a problem.
Well, first of all, your mom's got a lot on her plate, and I think she's doing an outstanding job considering...
It's not about Mom.
Oh.
It's about my teacher.
It's like she's made it her mission in life to keep me from ever graduating.
Turn that thing off.
But what if it's important?
Choose.
Look, here's the problem.
She's notorious for being harder on the girls, but when she found out I was from a family of cops...
Look, I should really check it.
Choose.
Grandpa...
How would you feel if I was constantly interrupting?
Deputy Commissioner Moore just walked in.
Hold that thought.
A cop's been shot.
Who and where?
North End bus yard, multiple precincts rolled, but radio chatter's not clear on a name, how bad they're hit.
We've got conflicting descriptions of perps and direction of flight.
Tell me something we do know.
Whoever's down is a detective out of Danny's precinct.
This is Detective Reagan.
Leave a message.
Hey, Danny, it's me;
give me a call.
Let me know everything's okay.
Hey, voice mail again?
Yeah, third time.
You heard anything new?
Lady called 911, said she was out walking her dog, heard yelling from behind a fence.
Someone being accused of being a cop.
Shots fired.
There's still no name?
Only that he was rushed to St. Benjamin's.
A couple of guys are headed over.
All right, I'm gonna ask the boss if we can, too, just in case, all right?
Okay, come on, there's got to be 15 detectives in the 5-4 squad.
Odds are it isn't your brother.
Danny's wife.
No way she's heard anything.
Unless she got the call.
Hey, Linda.
Jamie, it's not Danny.
He called you?
Yeah, in case I heard, but he's fine.
He's working a case in Murray Hill, and he said he was gonna call your dad as soon as he hung up with me.
Thank God.
Yeah, no kidding.
Listen...
Hi, Mom!
Awesome!
Yeah, I'm picking the boys up right now, so could you call Erin and Henry?
You know, make sure they're not worried, too.
Yeah, they already are.
Thanks, Linda.
I'm glad it wasn't Danny.
There, I said it.
I felt the same way.
Danny's family.
Steve Tomlin has one, too.
Let's hope for the best.
Dino says
Steve has been undercover for the last year, working his way up the chain of a drug operation run by Santo Castillo.
Somebody made him.
Word is, after Castillo shot him,
Steve managed to put a slug in Castillo, who ran off.
Tough cop.
Gave him the Combat Cross in '09.
Commissioner?
How's my officer?
Um, I'm afraid he's gone.
Three bullets, one through the carotid.
He lost too much blood by the time he arrived.
Thank you, Doctor.
I'll need to talk to his wife.
Lorraine.
Married to Steve for 22 years, tax accountant by trade.
They have a home in Staten Island.
Frank, she's here.
Two daughters, Bella and Lucy, both in college.
Mrs. Tomlin?
I'm so sorry.
Can I arrange to get Lucy and Bella home from school?
Oh, that, uh...
Uh, yes.
Um, thank you.
My department owes Steve a deep debt of gratitude for his years of service.
Anything we can do to help, you only need to ask.
Catch whoever murdered my husband.
We will do that.

Tell me we got the son of a bitch.
Wish I could.
That's not the answer I want to hear, Dino.
Yes, sir.
Morning, Baker.
Morning, sir.
Castillo was shot.
That would've slowed him down.
He hasn't turned up in any E.R. in the tri-state.
I've got the whole department out looking.
Half of them are doing it on their own time.
Who'd you put with the family?
Johnson and Garcia.
They came up in the ranks together.
And on the case?
Sergeant Gormley said he gave it to the best detective he's got.
On the ground!
Get on the ground!
Move it!
Back away from that sink!
On the ground now!
Turn around, get on the ground, put your hands behind your head!
Where's your boss?
Who?
You heard me.
Castillo.
Yo, we're just cleaning crew.
Yeah?
My cleaning lady keeps a bazooka, too.
Still enough here to send you down the drain.
What's your name?
Ticky.
Ticky, you want a break?
Give up the cop killer.
Like he said, we don't know anything.
Fine, you want to play stupid with me, get your hands up on the sink.
Move!
I got all the time in the world till you decide to wise up.
As far as I'm concerned, each one of you pulled the trigger on Steve Tomlin.
You're all coming for a ride;
let's go.
Get them out of here.
Erin, that was impressive.
Well, sometimes when you get the right witness, the whole case will fall into place.
Well, I'll get her statement typed up and to the DA by lunch.
Great.
Can you find the car?
Lady, can you give me some help?
Sorry, I don't have any change.
I mean a different kind of help.
Tyler?
What?
Tyler Jeffries.
I'm Nicky's mom.
Uh, my-my name's not Tyler.
From Blessed Heart.
You came to our house for Nicky's birthday party last year.
I said I'm not him.
Forget it.
Tyler, are you okay?
Here we go, Erin.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Tyler!
Put him in interrogation.
This one in the radio room.
Cuff the others to something solid.
Don't let them talk to each other or so much as trade glances.
This goes real easy, fellas.
First one to give up Castillo wins the prize.
You get the radio room;
I got the box.
Got it.
Reagan, you want help?
No.
I got cops from a dozen precincts volunteering to turn the screws on these guys.
No, we're gonna get a crack at them first.
All right, listen, Steve kept me in the loop on this Castillo.
Says his people are unusually loyal.
Boss of the year?
Great, I'm jealous.
Well, I'm just saying, you might hit a brick wall.
Then I'll drag his family in here.
If you can find them.
Apparently he has a sister, but Castillo made her change her name so nobody could find her and use her against him in some way.
Do you have any more words of encouragement here, Sarge, 'cause this level of optimism is really firing me up.
All right, just-just holler if you need help, all right?
If you hear any hollering, it won't be me.
Open it up.
Hi.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Homework.
Without being asked?
Who are you and what have you done with my daughter?
How was your day?
Weird.
You know that boy from your class, Tyler Jeffries?
Yeah.
What's his story?
Funny.
Super nice.
He's not in my class anymore, though.
He and his mom moved, like, five months ago.
I guess Tyler was getting high and stuff, so his mom put him in boarding school upstate to straighten him out.
Well, I don't think it worked.
What do you mean?
I ran into him today in Hell's Kitchen, and he looked messed up on drugs or homeless or both.
What?
Yeah, it took me a second to even recognize him.
Oh, my God.
But you helped him, right?
Well, he ran off before I could.
Then we got to go find him.
Well, I will call Child Services, and they will contact his mother.
Come on, can we just go look for him?
Relax, all right?
I will handle it.
Get him out of my face.
Nothing?
Nothing.
None of my guys even so much as asked for a lawyer.
They just sat there smirking at me.
You?
Same.
So what's next?
Pot of coffee.
Yeah, I'll go make one.
Thanks.
How's it going?
Don't ask.
Okay, so you want to give me a hand?
I'm kind of busy here, Sarge.
I need a witness to open Steve Tomlin's locker, collect his effects to give to his family.
Okay, I'll get a box.
I always hate this more than the funeral.
A life interrupted and all.
Well, at least there's no bagpipes.
They always make me cry.
It's empty.
I talked to Steve yesterday before he started his tour, Sarge.
His locker was open and it was full.
His uniform was in there, there were papers everywhere and pictures.
Somebody must've cleaned it out after he died.
But before we could find it.
Who the hell's hiding what?
277.
The number of cops lost in the line of duty since you've been on the job.
And now 23 since sitting behind this desk.
You want me to do a draft of your remarks for the service?
You ask me every time, Garrett.
And I'm gonna keep asking.
Some things you can't delegate, even a piece of.
But you could take a look at it when I'm done.
Castillo?
Not yet.
Last night
Sergeant Gormley went to collect Steve Tomlin's things, but somebody got there first.
Locker was completely empty.
Someone sanitized it.
And no way was it a civilian just waltzing in off the street.
I don't get it.
What's the big deal about a guy's locker?
What's in it.
Or isn't.
Any evidence of tampering goes right up the chain of command.
What, you think Castillo's got a mole in the 5-4?
That's the bad version.
I got a worse one: someone's covering for Tomlin.
We got a problem, Chief.
You sure this is a "we," Frank?
Wouldn't it be better and quieter if the department dealt with this on the precinct level?
No.
Thanks for coming, Uncle Jamie.
Everything okay?
Your text said it was "serious."
Yeah, it's about a friend of mine.
A friend?
No, really, he's a great kid.
Name's Tyler.
He went to my school, but Mom said she saw him in Hell's Kitchen looking like he was on drugs.
Did he use when you knew him?
I know he smoked pot sometimes.
No, I don't.
But if I did, and it'd help find Tyler, then I'd admit it.
So you want me to look for him.
Could you?
Mom said it was around 35th and 10th.
That's a pretty sketchy area.
Yeah, I know.
Here, that's what he looks like.
Your mom know you want me to do this?
Yeah, she's really worried, too.
She would've been here, but she wanted to go talk to Child Services about him.
All right, I'll see what I can do.
Thanks, Uncle Jamie.
And this isn't just me saying it.
This comes straight from the commissioner:
"Someone in the 5-4 cleaned out Steve Tomlin's locker
"without authorization...
"or knows who did.
"Which may very well be impeding the murder investigation
"of a brother in blue to each and every one of you.
"So let me be clear.
"If Detective Tomlin's belongings don't end up
"in my office by 2400 hours, there'll be hell to pay."
For all of us.
So, folks, while the rest of us get back to finding this son of a bitch Castillo, one of you is gonna stand up and do the right thing.
You owe it to Steve.
That's all.
And you two, you got some data to dig through, so get to it.
So, who do you think it is?
I don't want to believe anybody in this room could be capable of being Castillo's mole.
Well, he found out Tomlin was undercover somehow.
Well, maybe we'll get lucky and find it in all this data we gotta look through.
Well, looks like TARU found a bunch of steamy text messages from one of our thug's cell phones.
Which thug?
Said it belonged to Ticky, the one who was dumping the coke earlier.
I grilled him.
He didn't say squat.
Well, it looks like he had a lot to say when he was sexting this Vivian girl.
Look who he says her brother is.
Castillo.
Son of a bitch.
He was transported down to Central Booking.
Let's get his ass back here now.
Ah, another day of crime-fighting.
We should get capes.
I should get a new partner.
So why did you ask the boss for this sector today?
A favor for my niece and sister.
A friend of Nicky's was in this area the other day looking kind of rough, so I said I'd look for him.
Man, you do more for your family by 9:00 a.m.
than my family's done for each other our entire lives.
Name's Tyler Jeffries, about five-foot-eight, he's 16, he's got blond hair.
I got a picture of him here.
Yo, why do I gotta be back here for?
I still don't got nothing to say.
Why don't you relax, Ticky?
Why do they even call you Ticky, anyway?
Is it because you're a leech on a big fish like Santo Castillo, is that it?
I like watches.
Which is appropriate since your time's running out, unless you tell us where to find your boss.
Yo, like I told you before,
I don't know who you're talking about.
Really?
Even though you're banging his sister... what is, uh, Vivian?
Say what?
Say you right here in these text messages.
"Viv, u were incredible last nite as always."
To which she replied...
"Keep it on the DL, baby.
My bro will kill us if he finds out."
To which you replied...
"U kidding?
Santo heart me.
And I could kick, I could kick his ass anyway."
That's a different Santo.
Hmm.
Really?
Even though Vivian wrote back...
"Santo only hearts his $ and his drugs.
Watch yourself."
To which you replied...
"I only wanna watch u, baby."
Oh, smooth talker, I'll give him that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's just hope he's smooth enough to talk Santo out of blowing his brains out.
Okay, okay!
So I been hooking up with his sister.
Great.
Now you can tell us where she lives.
I can't tell you.
You know one big difference between you and I?
Is that I'm not afraid of your boss, unlike you.
In fact, when I see him,
I'm pretty much gonna tell him that you told us everything.
In fact, maybe I'll even show him this lovely little picture that his sister sent to you.
Please, look, if I give him up, he's gonna have me killed.
Her, too.
Aw...
Which means we're the only ones who can protect you, as long as you start talking.
Yep, so why don't you tell us where she lives?
Now!
Police!
Open up!
You can't just walk in here.
Yeah?
Well, this says we can.
Step aside.
Step aside!
See how easy that works?
Let's go!
Don't touch me!
Come on.
Tear this place apart.
Let's go.
You can't just do that, all right?
I know my rights.
Where's your brother, Vivian?
I don't have one.
Santo Castillo, you're his sister
Dolores, until he made you change your name to Vivian Vasquez.
What are you talking about?
Do you think we're stupid?
He got shot up.
You're a nurse.
Where else would he go?
Maybe to his real sister, 'cause you got the wrong place.
So you all can kiss my ass!
Hey!
Your brother's a cop killer.
And he's going down hard.
And if you're harboring him, you're gonna go down just as hard, you understand?
And I ain't going nowhere 'cause I'm the only one here.
Hands where I can see 'em!
Is that right?
Let me go!
I didn't do nothing!
Perp in custody!
You were saying?
Come on, come on.
He hid in the tub.
Yeah, real original.
Hope you got clean, Castillo, 'cause that's the last shower you're gonna take by yourself for a long time.
Yeah, and if you think you're in a bad mood now, wait till you find out your sister's screwing the help.
What's he saying?
Santo, I can explain.
You'll explain it to him later.
Get him the hell out of here.
Get him in the hallway.
Take a look at 'em all, Castillo.
Every cop in here wants to take a piece out of you.
Open up.
I want my lawyer.
Won't do you any good.
Next stop for you is a deep, dark hole.
Yeah, and on your way down, you can tell us who helped you set up Steve.
What?
Your mole inside this precinct.
If that's what you think, you ain't never gonna figure out how I found out.
Right.
Giving up the cop who set up Steve is the only card you've got-- tell your lawyer to play it.
Let's go-
- I want to wash this dirtbag off my hands.
Checking to see if Castillo's gonna give you up, Becker?
You're out of your mind.
What's your problem?
Thought opening lockers was your specialty.
Steve's locker's right behind me.
That gives you plenty of opportunity to scope out his combination, or eavesdrop and see how close he's getting to Castillo.
Listen, Detective...
The only thing I'm listening to, Becker, is you admit to it right now.
Okay, fine, it was me.
I cleaned it out!
You Castillo's mole?
Huh?
No, you got that wrong!
I don't have it wrong.
And if I do, you better tell me why.
Why'd you do it?
!
Hey, beat it!
Both of you, beat it now!
It's none of your damn business.
Start talking, Becker.
I just copped to it, Reagan.
But that's all I got to say.
And you understand the consequences of what you did?
Possible grand larceny, possible criminal possession of stolen property, possible conspiracy in the murder of a police officer.
Yes, sir.
Yet you didn't ask for a lawyer or a union rep.
I don't need one, sir.
It was me who cleaned out Steve Tomlin's locker.
On a cop killer's orders?
I'm no one's mole and I don't know how Steve's cover got blown.
At ease.
Sit down.
What you did doesn't square with your record.
Come on, Bill.
I know you're sitting on something.
Six years ago...
I was still on probation... and me and my training officer heard this bank heist call go over the air.
Steve was already on the scene when we got there, and all of a sudden, these robbers burst out, guns blazing... and...
I froze.
I assume this is going somewhere.
Steve pushed me out of the way before I got my head blown off... and he took down both the perps.
He...
He saved the day.
That night I bought all his drinks and... we became friends.
So you owed him?
What was he mixed up in?
Steve was clean as a whistle, sir.
And-and this has nothing to do with the job.
Then I know he wouldn't want you to blow up your career over this.
He has another family.
Wait, so you saw Tyler?
Yeah.
About a block down from where your mom saw him.
He was digging through a trash can.
Was he on drugs?
He didn't look good.
But, you-you took him home, right?
No.
We never got the chance.
He pushed Eddie pretty hard and then he ran.
We went after him, but...
he was gone, just like that.
God.
So, he's still out there?
Unfortunately, yeah, but I gave his photo to all the cars in the precinct and I'm gonna ask for the same assignment tomorrow, okay?
Like hell you will.
Mom!
I was just telling Uncle Jamie about...
Yeah.
I heard all about it.
You sent him out looking?
Just let me explain.
Wait.
What?
I thought you said your mom knew about this?
Would you both just listen to me?
Look, I had to make sure Tyler got help before something bad happened.
So that justifies going behind my back?
And lying to me, Nicky?
I'm sorry.
But maybe if you didn't treat me like I'm still a little kid...
Well, you just proved that you are, by ignoring me when I said I would take care of it.
So, did you?
I spoke to ACS, they've reached out to Tyler's mom, and I haven't heard back yet.
So now he's out there somewhere doing God knows what with God knows who.
The conversation's over.
If you don't eat your vegetables, no dessert.
Delicious, as always.
You hardly ate.
I ate.
Who made the potatoes?
Uh, I think it was Nicky.
Better not say you didn't like 'em.
Loved 'em.
Good and cheesy.
I'm surprised you found time to cook.
I managed.
Mm-hmm.
We missing something here?
Feeling a little cold chill coming from this side of the table.
What's going on?
Nothing anyone needs to know about.
See, Francis?
Hard enough having even one family some days.
Boys, take your plates and go eat in the kitchen.
So you guys can have a conversation we're not supposed to hear?
That's exactly right, Jack.
Go on.
Come on, I'll eat with you.
Go easy on this, Pop.
I'm not going to pussyfoot around this.
What kind of cop has two families?
What?
Who?
The one that got killed?
Yeah.
Yeah,
Steve Tomlin.
He had a wife and two kids in Staten Island and a girlfriend with a newborn baby in Jersey.
And you didn't know?
Steve is in your squad.
He was in my squad and I'm friendly with him, but pretty much nobody knew what was going on with him.
Well, you know what, one of those women knew what was going on, and it was probably the girlfriend.
So she doesn't deserve any sympathy?
He's the father of her kid.
No, that's not what I'm saying, Jamie.
Maybe he was that good of a catch that they were happy to share him.
I personally just try to figure out where a man finds the time or energy to carry on with two families.
You-you looking for some tips?
No, I'm not looking for tips.
I'm just saying it's a mess.
Which isn't over.
Right, the funeral.
Well, you can count me out.
And we will.
Oh, come on, Grandpa.
We don't really know what was going on with Tomlin's life.
I mean, maybe he was making the best of a bad situation, you know?
You saying you excuse what he did?
No, I'm just saying I'm reserving judgment until the smoke clears a little.
Exactly.
I got personal items for two different women.
Some need to go to the girlfriend.
Mmm, kind of got to side with Gramps on this one.
Thank you.
There's a line, and men know where it's drawn.
You're also the cop on the case.
Well, then I'll deliver whatever I need to.
Thank you, Danny.
You got it, Dad.
Guess what sector we got this morning.
Judging by the smile on your face, Restaurant Row.
Back to Hell's Kitchen.
Really?
Boss says we did great.
15 summonses and a felony collar.
And I volunteered us since I know you want to find Tyler again.
Says who?
Your niece put you on the case.
Yeah, until my sister blew a gasket.
Sergeant.
Come on, friend of Nicky's or not, that kid needs help.
So let's go find him again.
But he's not gonna be hanging around Hell's Kitchen.
Not after he knows we're looking for him.
Yeah, I thought the same thing till I talked to a couple of guys in Narcotics who executed a warrant on a drug spot on that very same block this morning.
And guess who was seen running from the scene.
Well, let's go look for Tyler.
I knew I loved him from the moment we met.
He moved me here, and pretty soon she was on the way.
And now it's just us two.
I'm sorry it took so long, with all the... issues around Steve.
Issues?
Did Steve stay home every night?
No, he was undercover.
Had to be gone a lot.
Did he wear a ring?
No, why would he?
He was single.
Detective, what-what are you saying?
I'm saying that Steve Tomlin was married.
No.
He had two kids.
Both in their 20s.
No.
You're wrong.
He w... he was with me.
We were going to get married, just-just as soon as-as... as soon as...
I'm sorry.
Regardless of whether or not he was married, it's obvious that he loved you.
You're defending him?
Surprises me, too.
Look, Steve could have abandoned the both of you, but he didn't.
In fact, you should probably take a look at this.
It was in his locker, too.
"Deferred compensation."
Kind of like a pension.
Cop gets to choose who the beneficiaries are, and Steve chose the both of you.
So Angela will be taken care of?
I'm not sure if he filed it.
But it's obvious that he wanted the both of you to be taken care of.
Do you think...
he would've done that if he didn't love you very much?
Tyler Jeffries?
Police!
Stop!
Hold it right there.
Let me go.
Please.
Please let me go.
Please.
Why?
So you can go get high again?
Aw, sorry, buddy, those days are over.
Yeah.
Along with shoving police officers, which, by the way, is assault.
Hey.
We tried this the easy way.
Now you get the hard way.
You got anything sharp in your pockets, like a needle?
Anything that's gonna stick me?
Look, I-I don't do drugs.
Yeah, that's not what my niece says.
Look, I, I was a screwup at school, okay?
But I stopped all that.
I swear.
Yeah?
What were you passing around with your pals back there?
Your report card with all As?
Huh?
It was... it was her photo.
To see if anyone's seen her.
"Her" who, huh?
Whoa, whoa.
It's just a picture.
My mom... came down here a week ago to score and never came back home.
She's the junkie.
Thanks for bringing these.
The girls'll be happy to know their father kept them so close.
I'm just trying to carry out what...
I think he'd want.
Steve was a hell of a cop, and I honor that.
It's all he ever wanted to be.
Well, I'll be sure and say that when I stand up for him at the funeral.
And if there's anything else my department can do...
I only have to ask.
Can I ask this?
Could you please not lie to me, Commissioner?
Steve's lies were bad enough, but to have all of you parade around here with your sad smiles and your pats on the back for the poor widow... and nobody has the guts to admit what I've known for the past year?
I'm not sure I understand.
Of course.
Once I knew, I did what every good wife does.
Blamed myself.
Tried to make him love me again.
I mean, I...
I do love the guy.
And the only time I lost it was when I...
I'd had too much to drink and I...
I found his phone and I called the number I didn't recognize and I told the bitch off.
Told her I was the one who had stuck by him all these years and raised his family while he was out on the job.
And I hung up the phone before she could get a word in edgewise.
I'm very sorry.
You know what you could do?
Skip Steve's funeral.
Just skip the nice speech about how honor is such a big part of the job.
How the NYPD appreciates the sacrifices made by the families.
You might be able to get the words out, but I, for one, don't want to hear them.
His real family doesn't want to hear it.
Can you do that for me?
Good-bye, Commissioner.
Frank.
I've got good news.
I could use some.
Corporation counsel reviewed Steve Tomlin's financials.
He filled out his deferred compensation papers but never submitted them, so they're invalid.
The Staten Island family will get all the money and benefits.
And how is that good news?
Well, the last thing this office needs is legal wrangling with an irate widow.
Or lurid headlines about a two-timing cop.
So it's good news for this office?
What about Marianna and their baby?
Well, technically, they're not his family.
Technically?
I don't blame them.
Doesn't take a ring to make a family.
I tried to give you an out, Frank.
But you chose to be mixed up in this.
I'm just telling you where we are.
On the high moral ground, apparently.
That's not fair.
None of this is.
That's no excuse to turn our backs on a woman with a cop's baby.
Look, if you can fire a way to help out both families, I'm all ears.
As far as I see it, the department's hands are tied.
You really sure I should be here?
I called your mom to ask her, but she didn't answer, so...
No, I mean because I lied to you.
We're good, Nicky.
And I think that Tyler could really use a friend right about now.
Tyler.
Oh, my God,
I thought you moved.
That's what I told everyone.
So they wouldn't know the truth.
Tyler's mom has been having some problems.
What do you mean?
First it was prescription drugs.
Then it became other stuff.
Ms. Jeffries disappeared about a week ago.
Tyler's been out looking for her.
Why didn't you let my mom help you?
Or my uncle?
Because then you'd find out, and... people at school.
But...
I guess they'll all find out anyway when it's in the papers that she's dead.
Tyler, we don't know that she is.
Then why can't I find her?
I've looked everywhere.
Because she's been in the hospital.
Accidental OD.
She's been a Jane Doe at Bellevue for a couple days.
Is there any way I can see her?
That's why I'm here.
So you did keep looking for her.
And your uncle is on his way down from Rhode Island.
You'll stay with him until your mom gets clean.
Thank you so much.
All of you.
We just did what she asked.
Come on.
I want a cape.
Ah.
Cheers.
Yeah.
I need a little help here, Pop.
Is this about that Tomlin fellow?
His second family needs to be taken care of.
Wasn't that his job?
Well, he got himself killed in the line of duty before he got around to it.
So throw him a 10-13 party.
There is a three-month-old baby girl who's gonna grow up without a father.
And the problem does not get solved by some cash in a cigar box on a bar.
Where is everyone?
In here.
Oh.
Are you here to help your old man muscle me into pitching in?
If that's what's going on, I am now.
Come on, Pop.
You're on the board of the Policeman's Fund.
Yeah, so?
So it may be time to put some of that influence to good use, Gramps.
Create a back-pocket pension for one more widow and orphan.
Old dog, new tricks.
I haven't said yes.
You gonna say no?
So what's going on?
I went to see the girlfriend again to confirm that Tomlin's wife did in fact call her as she claimed.
Wait a minute.
The wife called the girlfriend?
The wife thought she called the girlfriend.
She found a number in Tomlin's cell phone.
She called it, thinking it would be the girlfriend on the other end.
Tomlin was undercover in Castillo's gang.
And unfortunately...
She accidentally called one of them.
Yeah.
It was Tomlin's wife who blew his cover, Gramps.
Couple days later, we got a dead cop.
You got to be kidding me.
If I was kidding, someone would be laughing.
Good Lord.
She loses her husband and then has to hear this.
It'll kill the woman.
Unless she doesn't hear it.
I can't lie to that woman again.
She has to know.
Commissioner Reagan.
I need to talk to you, Mrs. Tomlin.
I've said everything I have to say.
Well,
I'm afraid I haven't.
I'm sorry, I got nothing for nobody.
I'm burying my husband tomorrow.
I didn't handle our meeting very well, yesterday, and I'm sorry.
But I think...
Steve would've wanted the NYPD represented at his service.
I know he would.
And it would be my honor to do that for him.
You came all the way out here just to ask me that?
Yes, I did.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Isn't this place charming?
As advertised, but you didn't invite me here for the charm or the ice cream.
We can't just have ice cream?
We can, but not in this instance.
Better chance of being hit by lightning.
Okay, I have a problem.
Well, first of all, your mom's got a lot on her plate, and I think she's doing an outstanding job considering...
It's not about Mom.
Oh.
It's about my teacher.
It's like she's made it her mission in life to keep me from ever graduating.
Turn that thing off.
But what if it's important?
Choose.
Look, here's the problem.
She's notorious for being harder on the girls, but when she found out I was from a family of cops...
Look, I should really check it.
Choose.
Grandpa...
How would you feel if I was constantly interrupting?
Deputy Commissioner Moore just walked in.
Hold that thought.
A cop's been shot.
Who and where?
North End bus yard, multiple precincts rolled, but radio chatter's not clear on a name, how bad they're hit.
We've got conflicting descriptions of perps and direction of flight.
Tell me something we do know.
Whoever's down is a detective out of Danny's precinct.
This is Detective Reagan.
Leave a message.
Hey, Danny, it's me;
give me a call.
Let me know everything's okay.
Hey, voice mail again?
Yeah, third time.
You heard anything new?
Lady called 911, said she was out walking her dog, heard yelling from behind a fence.
Someone being accused of being a cop.
Shots fired.
There's still no name?
Only that he was rushed to St. Benjamin's.
A couple of guys are headed over.
All right, I'm gonna ask the boss if we can, too, just in case, all right?
Okay, come on, there's got to be 15 detectives in the 5-4 squad.
Odds are it isn't your brother.
Danny's wife.
No way she's heard anything.
Unless she got the call.
Hey, Linda.
Jamie, it's not Danny.
He called you?
Yeah, in case I heard, but he's fine.
He's working a case in Murray Hill, and he said he was gonna call your dad as soon as he hung up with me.
Thank God.
Yeah, no kidding.
Listen...
Hi, Mom!
Awesome!
Yeah, I'm picking the boys up right now, so could you call Erin and Henry?
You know, make sure they're not worried, too.
Yeah, they already are.
Thanks, Linda.
I'm glad it wasn't Danny.
There, I said it.
I felt the same way.
Danny's family.
Steve Tomlin has one, too.
Let's hope for the best.
Dino says
Steve has been undercover for the last year, working his way up the chain of a drug operation run by Santo Castillo.
Somebody made him.
Word is, after Castillo shot him,
Steve managed to put a slug in Castillo, who ran off.
Tough cop.
Gave him the Combat Cross in '09.
Commissioner?
How's my officer?
Um, I'm afraid he's gone.
Three bullets, one through the carotid.
He lost too much blood by the time he arrived.
Thank you, Doctor.
I'll need to talk to his wife.
Lorraine.
Married to Steve for 22 years, tax accountant by trade.
They have a home in Staten Island.
Frank, she's here.
Two daughters, Bella and Lucy, both in college.
Mrs. Tomlin?
I'm so sorry.
Can I arrange to get Lucy and Bella home from school?
Oh, that, uh...
Uh, yes.
Um, thank you.
My department owes Steve a deep debt of gratitude for his years of service.
Anything we can do to help, you only need to ask.
Catch whoever murdered my husband.
We will do that.

Tell me we got the son of a bitch.
Wish I could.
That's not the answer I want to hear, Dino.
Yes, sir.
Morning, Baker.
Morning, sir.
Castillo was shot.
That would've slowed him down.
He hasn't turned up in any E.R. in the tri-state.
I've got the whole department out looking.
Half of them are doing it on their own time.
Who'd you put with the family?
Johnson and Garcia.
They came up in the ranks together.
And on the case?
Sergeant Gormley said he gave it to the best detective he's got.
On the ground!
Get on the ground!
Move it!
Back away from that sink!
On the ground now!
Turn around, get on the ground, put your hands behind your head!
Where's your boss?
Who?
You heard me.
Castillo.
Yo, we're just cleaning crew.
Yeah?
My cleaning lady keeps a bazooka, too.
Still enough here to send you down the drain.
What's your name?
Ticky.
Ticky, you want a break?
Give up the cop killer.
Like he said, we don't know anything.
Fine, you want to play stupid with me, get your hands up on the sink.
Move!
I got all the time in the world till you decide to wise up.
As far as I'm concerned, each one of you pulled the trigger on Steve Tomlin.
You're all coming for a ride;
let's go.
Get them out of here.
Erin, that was impressive.
Well, sometimes when you get the right witness, the whole case will fall into place.
Well, I'll get her statement typed up and to the DA by lunch.
Great.
Can you find the car?
Lady, can you give me some help?
Sorry, I don't have any change.
I mean a different kind of help.
Tyler?
What?
Tyler Jeffries.
I'm Nicky's mom.
Uh, my-my name's not Tyler.
From Blessed Heart.
You came to our house for Nicky's birthday party last year.
I said I'm not him.
Forget it.
Tyler, are you okay?
Here we go, Erin.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Tyler!
Put him in interrogation.
This one in the radio room.
Cuff the others to something solid.
Don't let them talk to each other or so much as trade glances.
This goes real easy, fellas.
First one to give up Castillo wins the prize.
You get the radio room;
I got the box.
Got it.
Reagan, you want help?
No.
I got cops from a dozen precincts volunteering to turn the screws on these guys.
No, we're gonna get a crack at them first.
All right, listen, Steve kept me in the loop on this Castillo.
Says his people are unusually loyal.
Boss of the year?
Great, I'm jealous.
Well, I'm just saying, you might hit a brick wall.
Then I'll drag his family in here.
If you can find them.
Apparently he has a sister, but Castillo made her change her name so nobody could find her and use her against him in some way.
Do you have any more words of encouragement here, Sarge, 'cause this level of optimism is really firing me up.
All right, just-just holler if you need help, all right?
If you hear any hollering, it won't be me.
Open it up.
Hi.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Homework.
Without being asked?
Who are you and what have you done with my daughter?
How was your day?
Weird.
You know that boy from your class, Tyler Jeffries?
Yeah.
What's his story?
Funny.
Super nice.
He's not in my class anymore, though.
He and his mom moved, like, five months ago.
I guess Tyler was getting high and stuff, so his mom put him in boarding school upstate to straighten him out.
Well, I don't think it worked.
What do you mean?
I ran into him today in Hell's Kitchen, and he looked messed up on drugs or homeless or both.
What?
Yeah, it took me a second to even recognize him.
Oh, my God.
But you helped him, right?
Well, he ran off before I could.
Then we got to go find him.
Well, I will call Child Services, and they will contact his mother.
Come on, can we just go look for him?
Relax, all right?
I will handle it.
Get him out of my face.
Nothing?
Nothing.
None of my guys even so much as asked for a lawyer.
They just sat there smirking at me.
You?
Same.
So what's next?
Pot of coffee.
Yeah, I'll go make one.
Thanks.
How's it going?
Don't ask.
Okay, so you want to give me a hand?
I'm kind of busy here, Sarge.
I need a witness to open Steve Tomlin's locker, collect his effects to give to his family.
Okay, I'll get a box.
I always hate this more than the funeral.
A life interrupted and all.
Well, at least there's no bagpipes.
They always make me cry.
It's empty.
I talked to Steve yesterday before he started his tour, Sarge.
His locker was open and it was full.
His uniform was in there, there were papers everywhere and pictures.
Somebody must've cleaned it out after he died.
But before we could find it.
Who the hell's hiding what?
277.
The number of cops lost in the line of duty since you've been on the job.
And now 23 since sitting behind this desk.
You want me to do a draft of your remarks for the service?
You ask me every time, Garrett.
And I'm gonna keep asking.
Some things you can't delegate, even a piece of.
But you could take a look at it when I'm done.
Castillo?
Not yet.
Last night
Sergeant Gormley went to collect Steve Tomlin's things, but somebody got there first.
Locker was completely empty.
Someone sanitized it.
And no way was it a civilian just waltzing in off the street.
I don't get it.
What's the big deal about a guy's locker?
What's in it.
Or isn't.
Any evidence of tampering goes right up the chain of command.
What, you think Castillo's got a mole in the 5-4?
That's the bad version.
I got a worse one: someone's covering for Tomlin.
We got a problem, Chief.
You sure this is a "we," Frank?
Wouldn't it be better and quieter if the department dealt with this on the precinct level?
No.
Thanks for coming, Uncle Jamie.
Everything okay?
Your text said it was "serious."
Yeah, it's about a friend of mine.
A friend?
No, really, he's a great kid.
Name's Tyler.
He went to my school, but Mom said she saw him in Hell's Kitchen looking like he was on drugs.
Did he use when you knew him?
I know he smoked pot sometimes.
No, I don't.
But if I did, and it'd help find Tyler, then I'd admit it.
So you want me to look for him.
Could you?
Mom said it was around 35th and 10th.
That's a pretty sketchy area.
Yeah, I know.
Here, that's what he looks like.
Your mom know you want me to do this?
Yeah, she's really worried, too.
She would've been here, but she wanted to go talk to Child Services about him.
All right, I'll see what I can do.
Thanks, Uncle Jamie.
And this isn't just me saying it.
This comes straight from the commissioner:
"Someone in the 5-4 cleaned out Steve Tomlin's locker
"without authorization...
"or knows who did.
"Which may very well be impeding the murder investigation
"of a brother in blue to each and every one of you.
"So let me be clear.
"If Detective Tomlin's belongings don't end up
"in my office by 2400 hours, there'll be hell to pay."
For all of us.
So, folks, while the rest of us get back to finding this son of a bitch Castillo, one of you is gonna stand up and do the right thing.
You owe it to Steve.
That's all.
And you two, you got some data to dig through, so get to it.
So, who do you think it is?
I don't want to believe anybody in this room could be capable of being Castillo's mole.
Well, he found out Tomlin was undercover somehow.
Well, maybe we'll get lucky and find it in all this data we gotta look through.
Well, looks like TARU found a bunch of steamy text messages from one of our thug's cell phones.
Which thug?
Said it belonged to Ticky, the one who was dumping the coke earlier.
I grilled him.
He didn't say squat.
Well, it looks like he had a lot to say when he was sexting this Vivian girl.
Look who he says her brother is.
Castillo.
Son of a bitch.
He was transported down to Central Booking.
Let's get his ass back here now.
Ah, another day of crime-fighting.
We should get capes.
I should get a new partner.
So why did you ask the boss for this sector today?
A favor for my niece and sister.
A friend of Nicky's was in this area the other day looking kind of rough, so I said I'd look for him.
Man, you do more for your family by 9:00 a.m.
than my family's done for each other our entire lives.
Name's Tyler Jeffries, about five-foot-eight, he's 16, he's got blond hair.
I got a picture of him here.
Yo, why do I gotta be back here for?
I still don't got nothing to say.
Why don't you relax, Ticky?
Why do they even call you Ticky, anyway?
Is it because you're a leech on a big fish like Santo Castillo, is that it?
I like watches.
Which is appropriate since your time's running out, unless you tell us where to find your boss.
Yo, like I told you before,
I don't know who you're talking about.
Really?
Even though you're banging his sister... what is, uh, Vivian?
Say what?
Say you right here in these text messages.
"Viv, u were incredible last nite as always."
To which she replied...
"Keep it on the DL, baby.
My bro will kill us if he finds out."
To which you replied...
"U kidding?
Santo heart me.
And I could kick, I could kick his ass anyway."
That's a different Santo.
Hmm.
Really?
Even though Vivian wrote back...
"Santo only hearts his $ and his drugs.
Watch yourself."
To which you replied...
"I only wanna watch u, baby."
Oh, smooth talker, I'll give him that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's just hope he's smooth enough to talk Santo out of blowing his brains out.
Okay, okay!
So I been hooking up with his sister.
Great.
Now you can tell us where she lives.
I can't tell you.
You know one big difference between you and I?
Is that I'm not afraid of your boss, unlike you.
In fact, when I see him,
I'm pretty much gonna tell him that you told us everything.
In fact, maybe I'll even show him this lovely little picture that his sister sent to you.
Please, look, if I give him up, he's gonna have me killed.
Her, too.
Aw...
Which means we're the only ones who can protect you, as long as you start talking.
Yep, so why don't you tell us where she lives?
Now!
Police!
Open up!
You can't just walk in here.
Yeah?
Well, this says we can.
Step aside.
Step aside!
See how easy that works?
Let's go!
Don't touch me!
Come on.
Tear this place apart.
Let's go.
You can't just do that, all right?
I know my rights.
Where's your brother, Vivian?
I don't have one.
Santo Castillo, you're his sister
Dolores, until he made you change your name to Vivian Vasquez.
What are you talking about?
Do you think we're stupid?
He got shot up.
You're a nurse.
Where else would he go?
Maybe to his real sister, 'cause you got the wrong place.
So you all can kiss my ass!
Hey!
Your brother's a cop killer.
And he's going down hard.
And if you're harboring him, you're gonna go down just as hard, you understand?
And I ain't going nowhere 'cause I'm the only one here.
Hands where I can see 'em!
Is that right?
Let me go!
I didn't do nothing!
Perp in custody!
You were saying?
Come on, come on.
He hid in the tub.
Yeah, real original.
Hope you got clean, Castillo, 'cause that's the last shower you're gonna take by yourself for a long time.
Yeah, and if you think you're in a bad mood now, wait till you find out your sister's screwing the help.
What's he saying?
Santo, I can explain.
You'll explain it to him later.
Get him the hell out of here.
Get him in the hallway.
Take a look at 'em all, Castillo.
Every cop in here wants to take a piece out of you.
Open up.
I want my lawyer.
Won't do you any good.
Next stop for you is a deep, dark hole.
Yeah, and on your way down, you can tell us who helped you set up Steve.
What?
Your mole inside this precinct.
If that's what you think, you ain't never gonna figure out how I found out.
Right.
Giving up the cop who set up Steve is the only card you've got-- tell your lawyer to play it.
Let's go-
- I want to wash this dirtbag off my hands.
Checking to see if Castillo's gonna give you up, Becker?
You're out of your mind.
What's your problem?
Thought opening lockers was your specialty.
Steve's locker's right behind me.
That gives you plenty of opportunity to scope out his combination, or eavesdrop and see how close he's getting to Castillo.
Listen, Detective...
The only thing I'm listening to, Becker, is you admit to it right now.
Okay, fine, it was me.
I cleaned it out!
You Castillo's mole?
Huh?
No, you got that wrong!
I don't have it wrong.
And if I do, you better tell me why.
Why'd you do it?
!
Hey, beat it!
Both of you, beat it now!
It's none of your damn business.
Start talking, Becker.
I just copped to it, Reagan.
But that's all I got to say.
And you understand the consequences of what you did?
Possible grand larceny, possible criminal possession of stolen property, possible conspiracy in the murder of a police officer.
Yes, sir.
Yet you didn't ask for a lawyer or a union rep.
I don't need one, sir.
It was me who cleaned out Steve Tomlin's locker.
On a cop killer's orders?
I'm no one's mole and I don't know how Steve's cover got blown.
At ease.
Sit down.
What you did doesn't square with your record.
Come on, Bill.
I know you're sitting on something.
Six years ago...
I was still on probation... and me and my training officer heard this bank heist call go over the air.
Steve was already on the scene when we got there, and all of a sudden, these robbers burst out, guns blazing... and...
I froze.
I assume this is going somewhere.
Steve pushed me out of the way before I got my head blown off... and he took down both the perps.
He...
He saved the day.
That night I bought all his drinks and... we became friends.
So you owed him?
What was he mixed up in?
Steve was clean as a whistle, sir.
And-and this has nothing to do with the job.
Then I know he wouldn't want you to blow up your career over this.
He has another family.
Wait, so you saw Tyler?
Yeah.
About a block down from where your mom saw him.
He was digging through a trash can.
Was he on drugs?
He didn't look good.
But, you-you took him home, right?
No.
We never got the chance.
He pushed Eddie pretty hard and then he ran.
We went after him, but...
he was gone, just like that.
God.
So, he's still out there?
Unfortunately, yeah, but I gave his photo to all the cars in the precinct and I'm gonna ask for the same assignment tomorrow, okay?
Like hell you will.
Mom!
I was just telling Uncle Jamie about...
Yeah.
I heard all about it.
You sent him out looking?
Just let me explain.
Wait.
What?
I thought you said your mom knew about this?
Would you both just listen to me?
Look, I had to make sure Tyler got help before something bad happened.
So that justifies going behind my back?
And lying to me, Nicky?
I'm sorry.
But maybe if you didn't treat me like I'm still a little kid...
Well, you just proved that you are, by ignoring me when I said I would take care of it.
So, did you?
I spoke to ACS, they've reached out to Tyler's mom, and I haven't heard back yet.
So now he's out there somewhere doing God knows what with God knows who.
The conversation's over.
If you don't eat your vegetables, no dessert.
Delicious, as always.
You hardly ate.
I ate.
Who made the potatoes?
Uh, I think it was Nicky.
Better not say you didn't like 'em.
Loved 'em.
Good and cheesy.
I'm surprised you found time to cook.
I managed.
Mm-hmm.
We missing something here?
Feeling a little cold chill coming from this side of the table.
What's going on?
Nothing anyone needs to know about.
See, Francis?
Hard enough having even one family some days.
Boys, take your plates and go eat in the kitchen.
So you guys can have a conversation we're not supposed to hear?
That's exactly right, Jack.
Go on.
Come on, I'll eat with you.
Go easy on this, Pop.
I'm not going to pussyfoot around this.
What kind of cop has two families?
What?
Who?
The one that got killed?
Yeah.
Yeah,
Steve Tomlin.
He had a wife and two kids in Staten Island and a girlfriend with a newborn baby in Jersey.
And you didn't know?
Steve is in your squad.
He was in my squad and I'm friendly with him, but pretty much nobody knew what was going on with him.
Well, you know what, one of those women knew what was going on, and it was probably the girlfriend.
So she doesn't deserve any sympathy?
He's the father of her kid.
No, that's not what I'm saying, Jamie.
Maybe he was that good of a catch that they were happy to share him.
I personally just try to figure out where a man finds the time or energy to carry on with two families.
You-you looking for some tips?
No, I'm not looking for tips.
I'm just saying it's a mess.
Which isn't over.
Right, the funeral.
Well, you can count me out.
And we will.
Oh, come on, Grandpa.
We don't really know what was going on with Tomlin's life.
I mean, maybe he was making the best of a bad situation, you know?
You saying you excuse what he did?
No, I'm just saying I'm reserving judgment until the smoke clears a little.
Exactly.
I got personal items for two different women.
Some need to go to the girlfriend.
Mmm, kind of got to side with Gramps on this one.
Thank you.
There's a line, and men know where it's drawn.
You're also the cop on the case.
Well, then I'll deliver whatever I need to.
Thank you, Danny.
You got it, Dad.
Guess what sector we got this morning.
Judging by the smile on your face, Restaurant Row.
Back to Hell's Kitchen.
Really?
Boss says we did great.
15 summonses and a felony collar.
And I volunteered us since I know you want to find Tyler again.
Says who?
Your niece put you on the case.
Yeah, until my sister blew a gasket.
Sergeant.
Come on, friend of Nicky's or not, that kid needs help.
So let's go find him again.
But he's not gonna be hanging around Hell's Kitchen.
Not after he knows we're looking for him.
Yeah, I thought the same thing till I talked to a couple of guys in Narcotics who executed a warrant on a drug spot on that very same block this morning.
And guess who was seen running from the scene.
Well, let's go look for Tyler.
I knew I loved him from the moment we met.
He moved me here, and pretty soon she was on the way.
And now it's just us two.
I'm sorry it took so long, with all the... issues around Steve.
Issues?
Did Steve stay home every night?
No, he was undercover.
Had to be gone a lot.
Did he wear a ring?
No, why would he?
He was single.
Detective, what-what are you saying?
I'm saying that Steve Tomlin was married.
No.
He had two kids.
Both in their 20s.
No.
You're wrong.
He w... he was with me.
We were going to get married, just-just as soon as-as... as soon as...
I'm sorry.
Regardless of whether or not he was married, it's obvious that he loved you.
You're defending him?
Surprises me, too.
Look, Steve could have abandoned the both of you, but he didn't.
In fact, you should probably take a look at this.
It was in his locker, too.
"Deferred compensation."
Kind of like a pension.
Cop gets to choose who the beneficiaries are, and Steve chose the both of you.
So Angela will be taken care of?
I'm not sure if he filed it.
But it's obvious that he wanted the both of you to be taken care of.
Do you think...
he would've done that if he didn't love you very much?
Tyler Jeffries?
Police!
Stop!
Hold it right there.
Let me go.
Please.
Please let me go.
Please.
Why?
So you can go get high again?
Aw, sorry, buddy, those days are over.
Yeah.
Along with shoving police officers, which, by the way, is assault.
Hey.
We tried this the easy way.
Now you get the hard way.
You got anything sharp in your pockets, like a needle?
Anything that's gonna stick me?
Look, I-I don't do drugs.
Yeah, that's not what my niece says.
Look, I, I was a screwup at school, okay?
But I stopped all that.
I swear.
Yeah?
What were you passing around with your pals back there?
Your report card with all As?
Huh?
It was... it was her photo.
To see if anyone's seen her.
"Her" who, huh?
Whoa, whoa.
It's just a picture.
My mom... came down here a week ago to score and never came back home.
She's the junkie.
Thanks for bringing these.
The girls'll be happy to know their father kept them so close.
I'm just trying to carry out what...
I think he'd want.
Steve was a hell of a cop, and I honor that.
It's all he ever wanted to be.
Well, I'll be sure and say that when I stand up for him at the funeral.
And if there's anything else my department can do...
I only have to ask.
Can I ask this?
Could you please not lie to me, Commissioner?
Steve's lies were bad enough, but to have all of you parade around here with your sad smiles and your pats on the back for the poor widow... and nobody has the guts to admit what I've known for the past year?
I'm not sure I understand.
Of course.
Once I knew, I did what every good wife does.
Blamed myself.
Tried to make him love me again.
I mean, I...
I do love the guy.
And the only time I lost it was when I...
I'd had too much to drink and I...
I found his phone and I called the number I didn't recognize and I told the bitch off.
Told her I was the one who had stuck by him all these years and raised his family while he was out on the job.
And I hung up the phone before she could get a word in edgewise.
I'm very sorry.
You know what you could do?
Skip Steve's funeral.
Just skip the nice speech about how honor is such a big part of the job.
How the NYPD appreciates the sacrifices made by the families.
You might be able to get the words out, but I, for one, don't want to hear them.
His real family doesn't want to hear it.
Can you do that for me?
Good-bye, Commissioner.
Frank.
I've got good news.
I could use some.
Corporation counsel reviewed Steve Tomlin's financials.
He filled out his deferred compensation papers but never submitted them, so they're invalid.
The Staten Island family will get all the money and benefits.
And how is that good news?
Well, the last thing this office needs is legal wrangling with an irate widow.
Or lurid headlines about a two-timing cop.
So it's good news for this office?
What about Marianna and their baby?
Well, technically, they're not his family.
Technically?
I don't blame them.
Doesn't take a ring to make a family.
I tried to give you an out, Frank.
But you chose to be mixed up in this.
I'm just telling you where we are.
On the high moral ground, apparently.
That's not fair.
None of this is.
That's no excuse to turn our backs on a woman with a cop's baby.
Look, if you can fire a way to help out both families, I'm all ears.
As far as I see it, the department's hands are tied.
You really sure I should be here?
I called your mom to ask her, but she didn't answer, so...
No, I mean because I lied to you.
We're good, Nicky.
And I think that Tyler could really use a friend right about now.
Tyler.
Oh, my God,
I thought you moved.
That's what I told everyone.
So they wouldn't know the truth.
Tyler's mom has been having some problems.
What do you mean?
First it was prescription drugs.
Then it became other stuff.
Ms. Jeffries disappeared about a week ago.
Tyler's been out looking for her.
Why didn't you let my mom help you?
Or my uncle?
Because then you'd find out, and... people at school.
But...
I guess they'll all find out anyway when it's in the papers that she's dead.
Tyler, we don't know that she is.
Then why can't I find her?
I've looked everywhere.
Because she's been in the hospital.
Accidental OD.
She's been a Jane Doe at Bellevue for a couple days.
Is there any way I can see her?
That's why I'm here.
So you did keep looking for her.
And your uncle is on his way down from Rhode Island.
You'll stay with him until your mom gets clean.
Thank you so much.
All of you.
We just did what she asked.
Come on.
I want a cape.
Ah.
Cheers.
Yeah.
I need a little help here, Pop.
Is this about that Tomlin fellow?
His second family needs to be taken care of.
Wasn't that his job?
Well, he got himself killed in the line of duty before he got around to it.
So throw him a 10-13 party.
There is a three-month-old baby girl who's gonna grow up without a father.
And the problem does not get solved by some cash in a cigar box on a bar.
Where is everyone?
In here.
Oh.
Are you here to help your old man muscle me into pitching in?
If that's what's going on, I am now.
Come on, Pop.
You're on the board of the Policeman's Fund.
Yeah, so?
So it may be time to put some of that influence to good use, Gramps.
Create a back-pocket pension for one more widow and orphan.
Old dog, new tricks.
I haven't said yes.
You gonna say no?
So what's going on?
I went to see the girlfriend again to confirm that Tomlin's wife did in fact call her as she claimed.
Wait a minute.
The wife called the girlfriend?
The wife thought she called the girlfriend.
She found a number in Tomlin's cell phone.
She called it, thinking it would be the girlfriend on the other end.
Tomlin was undercover in Castillo's gang.
And unfortunately...
She accidentally called one of them.
Yeah.
It was Tomlin's wife who blew his cover, Gramps.
Couple days later, we got a dead cop.
You got to be kidding me.
If I was kidding, someone would be laughing.
Good Lord.
She loses her husband and then has to hear this.
It'll kill the woman.
Unless she doesn't hear it.
I can't lie to that woman again.
She has to know.
Commissioner Reagan.
I need to talk to you, Mrs. Tomlin.
I've said everything I have to say.
Well,
I'm afraid I haven't.
I'm sorry, I got nothing for nobody.
I'm burying my husband tomorrow.
I didn't handle our meeting very well, yesterday, and I'm sorry.
But I think...
Steve would've wanted the NYPD represented at his service.
I know he would.
And it would be my honor to do that for him.
You came all the way out here just to ask me that?
Yes, I did.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Isn't this place charming?
As advertised, but you didn't invite me here for the charm or the ice cream.
We can't just have ice cream?
We can, but not in this instance.
Better chance of being hit by lightning.
(chuckles)
Okay, I have a problem.
Well, first of all, your mom's got a lot on her plate, and I think she's doing an outstanding job considering...
It's not about Mom.
Oh.
It's about my teacher.
(phone rings) It's like she's made it her mission in life to keep me from ever graduating.
Turn that thing off.
But what if it's important?
Choose.
Look, here's the problem.
She's notorious for being harder on the girls, but when she found out I was from a family of cops...
Look, I should really check it.
Choose.
(door opens, bell dings)
Grandpa...
How would you feel if I was constantly interrupting?
Deputy Commissioner Moore just walked in.
(bell dings)
Hold that thought.
A cop's been shot.
(sighs) Who and where?
North End bus yard, multiple precincts rolled, but radio chatter's not clear on a name, how bad they're hit.
We've got conflicting descriptions of perps and direction of flight.
Tell me something we do know.
Whoever's down is a detective out of Danny's precinct.
(sighs)
DANNY:
This is Detective Reagan.
Leave a message.
Hey, Danny, it's me;
give me a call.
Let me know everything's okay.
Hey, voice mail again?
Yeah, third time.
You heard anything new?
Lady called 911, said she was out walking her dog, heard yelling from behind a fence.
Someone being accused of being a cop.
Shots fired.
There's still no name?
Only that he was rushed to St. Benjamin's.
A couple of guys are headed over.
All right, I'm gonna ask the boss if we can, too, just in case, all right?
Okay, come on, there's got to be 15 detectives in the 5-4 squad.
(phone ringing) Odds are it isn't your brother.
Danny's wife.
No way she's heard anything.
Unless she got the call.
Hey, Linda.
Jamie, it's not Danny.
He called you?
Yeah, in case I heard, but he's fine.
He's working a case in Murray Hill, and he said he was gonna call your dad as soon as he hung up with me.
Thank God.
Yeah, no kidding.
Listen...
Hi, Mom!
Awesome!
Yeah, I'm picking the boys up right now, so could you call Erin and Henry?
You know, make sure they're not worried, too.
Yeah, they already are.
Thanks, Linda.
(panting)
(groans)
(sighs)
I'm glad it wasn't Danny.
There, I said it.
I felt the same way.
Danny's family.
Steve Tomlin has one, too.
Let's hope for the best.
Dino says
Steve has been undercover for the last year, working his way up the chain of a drug operation run by Santo Castillo.
Somebody made him.
Word is, after Castillo shot him,
Steve managed to put a slug in Castillo, who ran off.
Tough cop.
Gave him the Combat Cross in '09.
(door opens)
Commissioner?
How's my officer?
Um, I'm afraid he's gone.
Three bullets, one through the carotid.
He lost too much blood by the time he arrived.
Thank you, Doctor.
I'll need to talk to his wife.
Lorraine.
Married to Steve for 22 years, tax accountant by trade.
They have a home in Staten Island.
Frank, she's here.
Two daughters, Bella and Lucy, both in college.
Mrs. Tomlin?
I'm so sorry.
Can I arrange to get Lucy and Bella home from school?
Oh, that, uh...
Uh, yes.
Um, thank you.
My department owes Steve a deep debt of gratitude for his years of service.
Anything we can do to help, you only need to ask.
Catch whoever murdered my husband.
We will do that.

(elevator bell dings)
Tell me we got the son of a bitch.
Wish I could.
That's not the answer I want to hear, Dino.
Yes, sir.
Morning, Baker.
Morning, sir.
Castillo was shot.
That would've slowed him down.
He hasn't turned up in any E.R. in the tri-state.
I've got the whole department out looking.
Half of them are doing it on their own time.
Who'd you put with the family?
Johnson and Garcia.
They came up in the ranks together.
And on the case?
Sergeant Gormley said he gave it to the best detective he's got.
(sighs)
(indistinct shouting)
DANNY:
On the ground!
Get on the ground!
Move it!
Back away from that sink!
On the ground now!
Turn around, get on the ground, put your hands behind your head!
Where's your boss?
Who?
You heard me.
Castillo.
Yo, we're just cleaning crew.
Yeah?
My cleaning lady keeps a bazooka, too.
Still enough here to send you down the drain.
What's your name?
Ticky.
Ticky, you want a break?
Give up the cop killer.
Like he said, we don't know anything.
Fine, you want to play stupid with me, get your hands up on the sink.
Move!
I got all the time in the world till you decide to wise up.
As far as I'm concerned, each one of you pulled the trigger on Steve Tomlin.
You're all coming for a ride;
let's go.
Get them out of here.
Erin, that was impressive.
Well, sometimes when you get the right witness, the whole case will fall into place.
Well, I'll get her statement typed up and to the DA by lunch.
Great.
Can you find the car?
Lady, can you give me some help?
Sorry, I don't have any change.
I mean a different kind of help.
Tyler?
What?
Tyler Jeffries.
I'm Nicky's mom.
Uh, my-my name's not Tyler.
From Blessed Heart.
You came to our house for Nicky's birthday party last year.
I said I'm not him.
Forget it.
Tyler, are you okay?
Here we go, Erin.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Tyler!
Put him in interrogation.
This one in the radio room.
Cuff the others to something solid.
Don't let them talk to each other or so much as trade glances.
This goes real easy, fellas.
First one to give up Castillo wins the prize.
You get the radio room;
I got the box.
Got it.
GORMLEY:
Reagan, you want help?
No.
I got cops from a dozen precincts volunteering to turn the screws on these guys.
No, we're gonna get a crack at them first.
All right, listen, Steve kept me in the loop on this Castillo.
Says his people are unusually loyal.
Boss of the year?
Great, I'm jealous.
Well, I'm just saying, you might hit a brick wall.
Then I'll drag his family in here.
If you can find them.
Apparently he has a sister, but Castillo made her change her name so nobody could find her and use her against him in some way.
Do you have any more words of encouragement here, Sarge, 'cause this level of optimism is really firing me up.
All right, just-just holler if you need help, all right?
If you hear any hollering, it won't be me.
Open it up.
Hi.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Homework.
Without being asked?
Who are you and what have you done with my daughter?
How was your day?
Weird.
You know that boy from your class, Tyler Jeffries?
Yeah.
What's his story?
Funny.
Super nice.
He's not in my class anymore, though.
He and his mom moved, like, five months ago.
I guess Tyler was getting high and stuff, so his mom put him in boarding school upstate to straighten him out.
Well, I don't think it worked.
What do you mean?
I ran into him today in Hell's Kitchen, and he looked messed up on drugs or homeless or both.
What?
Yeah, it took me a second to even recognize him.
Oh, my God.
But you helped him, right?
Well, he ran off before I could.
Then we got to go find him.
Well, I will call Child Services, and they will contact his mother.
Come on, can we just go look for him?
Relax, all right?
I will handle it.
(scoffs)
Get him out of my face.
Nothing?
Nothing.
None of my guys even so much as asked for a lawyer.
They just sat there smirking at me.
You?
Same.
So what's next?
Pot of coffee.
Yeah, I'll go make one.
Thanks.
GORMLEY:
How's it going?
Don't ask.
Okay, so you want to give me a hand?
I'm kind of busy here, Sarge.
I need a witness to open Steve Tomlin's locker, collect his effects to give to his family.
Okay, I'll get a box.
I always hate this more than the funeral.
A life interrupted and all.
Well, at least there's no bagpipes.
They always make me cry.
It's empty.
I talked to Steve yesterday before he started his tour, Sarge.
His locker was open and it was full.
His uniform was in there, there were papers everywhere and pictures.
Somebody must've cleaned it out after he died.
But before we could find it.
Who the hell's hiding what?
277.
The number of cops lost in the line of duty since you've been on the job.
And now 23 since sitting behind this desk.
You want me to do a draft of your remarks for the service?
You ask me every time, Garrett.
And I'm gonna keep asking.
Some things you can't delegate, even a piece of.
But you could take a look at it when I'm done.
Castillo?
Not yet.
Last night
Sergeant Gormley went to collect Steve Tomlin's things, but somebody got there first.
Locker was completely empty.
Someone sanitized it.
And no way was it a civilian just waltzing in off the street.
GARRETT:
I don't get it.
What's the big deal about a guy's locker?
What's in it.
Or isn't.
Any evidence of tampering goes right up the chain of command.
What, you think Castillo's got a mole in the 5-4?
That's the bad version.
I got a worse one: someone's covering for Tomlin.
We got a problem, Chief.
You sure this is a "we," Frank?
Wouldn't it be better and quieter if the department dealt with this on the precinct level?
No.
Thanks for coming, Uncle Jamie.
Everything okay?
Your text said it was "serious."
Yeah, it's about a friend of mine.
A friend?
No, really, he's a great kid.
Name's Tyler.
He went to my school, but Mom said she saw him in Hell's Kitchen looking like he was on drugs.
Did he use when you knew him?
I know he smoked pot sometimes.
No, I don't.
But if I did, and it'd help find Tyler, then I'd admit it.
So you want me to look for him.
Could you?
Mom said it was around 35th and 10th.
That's a pretty sketchy area.
Yeah, I know.
Here, that's what he looks like.
Your mom know you want me to do this?
Yeah, she's really worried, too.
She would've been here, but she wanted to go talk to Child Services about him.
All right, I'll see what I can do.
Thanks, Uncle Jamie.
And this isn't just me saying it.
This comes straight from the commissioner:
"Someone in the 5-4 cleaned out Steve Tomlin's locker
"without authorization...
"or knows who did.
"Which may very well be impeding the murder investigation
"of a brother in blue to each and every one of you.
"So let me be clear.
"If Detective Tomlin's belongings don't end up
"in my office by 2400 hours, there'll be hell to pay."
For all of us.
So, folks, while the rest of us get back to finding this son of a bitch Castillo, one of you is gonna stand up and do the right thing.
You owe it to Steve.
That's all.
And you two, you got some data to dig through, so get to it.
BAEZ:
So, who do you think it is?
I don't want to believe anybody in this room could be capable of being Castillo's mole.
Well, he found out Tomlin was undercover somehow.
Well, maybe we'll get lucky and find it in all this data we gotta look through.
Well, looks like TARU found a bunch of steamy text messages from one of our thug's cell phones.
Which thug?
Said it belonged to Ticky, the one who was dumping the coke earlier.
I grilled him.
He didn't say squat.
Well, it looks like he had a lot to say when he was sexting this Vivian girl.
Look who he says her brother is.
Castillo.
Son of a bitch.
He was transported down to Central Booking.
Let's get his ass back here now.
Ah, another day of crime-fighting.
We should get capes.
I should get a new partner.
(laughs)
So why did you ask the boss for this sector today?
A favor for my niece and sister.
A friend of Nicky's was in this area the other day looking kind of rough, so I said I'd look for him.
Man, you do more for your family by 9:00 a.m.
than my family's done for each other our entire lives.
Name's Tyler Jeffries, about five-foot-eight, he's 16, he's got blond hair.
I got a picture of him here.
Yo, why do I gotta be back here for?
I still don't got nothing to say.
Why don't you relax, Ticky?
Why do they even call you Ticky, anyway?
Is it because you're a leech on a big fish like Santo Castillo, is that it?
I like watches.
Which is appropriate since your time's running out, unless you tell us where to find your boss.
Yo, like I told you before,
I don't know who you're talking about.
Really?
Even though you're banging his sister... what is, uh, Vivian?
Say what?
Say you right here in these text messages.
"Viv, u were incredible last nite as always."
To which she replied...
"Keep it on the DL, baby.
My bro will kill us if he finds out."
To which you replied...
"U kidding?
Santo heart me.
And I could kick, I could kick his ass anyway."
That's a different Santo.
Hmm.
Really?
Even though Vivian wrote back...
"Santo only hearts his $ and his drugs.
Watch yourself."
To which you replied...
"I only wanna watch u, baby."
Oh, smooth talker, I'll give him that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's just hope he's smooth enough to talk Santo out of blowing his brains out.
Okay, okay!
So I been hooking up with his sister.
Great.
Now you can tell us where she lives.
I can't tell you.
You know one big difference between you and I?
Is that I'm not afraid of your boss, unlike you.
In fact, when I see him,
I'm pretty much gonna tell him that you told us everything.
In fact, maybe I'll even show him this lovely little picture that his sister sent to you.
Please, look, if I give him up, he's gonna have me killed.
Her, too.
Aw...
Which means we're the only ones who can protect you, as long as you start talking.
Yep, so why don't you tell us where she lives?
Now!
Police!
Open up!
You can't just walk in here.
Yeah?
Well, this says we can.
Step aside.
Step aside!
See how easy that works?
Let's go!
Don't touch me!
Come on.
Tear this place apart.
Let's go.
You can't just do that, all right?
I know my rights.
Where's your brother, Vivian?
I don't have one.
Santo Castillo, you're his sister
Dolores, until he made you change your name to Vivian Vasquez.
What are you talking about?
Do you think we're stupid?
He got shot up.
You're a nurse.
Where else would he go?
Maybe to his real sister, 'cause you got the wrong place.
So you all can kiss my ass!
Hey!
Your brother's a cop killer.
And he's going down hard.
And if you're harboring him, you're gonna go down just as hard, you understand?
And I ain't going nowhere 'cause I'm the only one here.
OFFICER:
Hands where I can see 'em!
Is that right?
MAN:
Let me go!
I didn't do nothing!
OFFICER:
Perp in custody!
You were saying?
OFFICER 2:
Come on, come on.
He hid in the tub.
Yeah, real original.
Hope you got clean, Castillo, 'cause that's the last shower you're gonna take by yourself for a long time.
Yeah, and if you think you're in a bad mood now, wait till you find out your sister's screwing the help.
What's he saying?
Santo, I can explain.
You'll explain it to him later.
Get him the hell out of here.
OFFICER 1:
Get him in the hallway.
Take a look at 'em all, Castillo.
Every cop in here wants to take a piece out of you.
Open up.
I want my lawyer.
Won't do you any good.
Next stop for you is a deep, dark hole.
Yeah, and on your way down, you can tell us who helped you set up Steve.
What?
Your mole inside this precinct.
(laughs):
If that's what you think, you ain't never gonna figure out how I found out.
Right.
BAEZ:
Giving up the cop who set up Steve is the only card you've got-- tell your lawyer to play it.
Let's go-
- I want to wash this dirtbag off my hands.
Checking to see if Castillo's gonna give you up, Becker?
You're out of your mind.
What's your problem?
Thought opening lockers was your specialty.
Steve's locker's right behind me.
That gives you plenty of opportunity to scope out his combination, or eavesdrop and see how close he's getting to Castillo.
Listen, Detective...
The only thing I'm listening to, Becker, is you admit to it right now.
Okay, fine, it was me.
I cleaned it out!
You Castillo's mole?
Huh?
No, you got that wrong!
I don't have it wrong.
And if I do, you better tell me why.
Why'd you do it?
!
Hey, beat it!
Both of you, beat it now!
It's none of your damn business.
Start talking, Becker.
I just copped to it, Reagan.
But that's all I got to say.
(sighs quietly)
And you understand the consequences of what you did?
Possible grand larceny, possible criminal possession of stolen property, possible conspiracy in the murder of a police officer.
Yes, sir.
Yet you didn't ask for a lawyer or a union rep.
I don't need one, sir.
It was me who cleaned out Steve Tomlin's locker.
On a cop killer's orders?
I'm no one's mole and I don't know how Steve's cover got blown.
(sighs)
At ease.
Sit down.
What you did doesn't square with your record.
Come on, Bill.
I know you're sitting on something.
Six years ago...
I was still on probation... and me and my training officer heard this bank heist call go over the air.
Steve was already on the scene when we got there, and all of a sudden, these robbers burst out, guns blazing... and...
I froze.
I assume this is going somewhere.
Steve pushed me out of the way before I got my head blown off... and he took down both the perps.
He...
He saved the day.
That night I bought all his drinks and... we became friends.
So you owed him?
What was he mixed up in?
Steve was clean as a whistle, sir.
And-and this has nothing to do with the job.
Then I know he wouldn't want you to blow up your career over this.
(sighs)
He has another family.
(water running)
Wait, so you saw Tyler?
Yeah.
About a block down from where your mom saw him.
He was digging through a trash can.
Was he on drugs?
He didn't look good.
But, you-you took him home, right?
No.
We never got the chance.
He pushed Eddie pretty hard and then he ran.
We went after him, but...
he was gone, just like that.
(sighs) God.
So, he's still out there?
Unfortunately, yeah, but I gave his photo to all the cars in the precinct and I'm gonna ask for the same assignment tomorrow, okay?
ERIN:
Like hell you will.
Mom!
I was just telling Uncle Jamie about...
Yeah.
I heard all about it.
You sent him out looking?
Just let me explain.
JAMIE:
Wait.
What?
I thought you said your mom knew about this?
Would you both just listen to me?
Look, I had to make sure Tyler got help before something bad happened.
So that justifies going behind my back?
And lying to me, Nicky?
I'm sorry.
But maybe if you didn't treat me like I'm still a little kid...
Well, you just proved that you are, by ignoring me when I said I would take care of it.
So, did you?
I spoke to ACS, they've reached out to Tyler's mom, and I haven't heard back yet.
So now he's out there somewhere doing God knows what with God knows who.
The conversation's over.
If you don't eat your vegetables, no dessert.
Delicious, as always.
You hardly ate.
I ate.
Who made the potatoes?
Uh, I think it was Nicky.
Better not say you didn't like 'em.
Loved 'em.
Good and cheesy.
(chuckles)
I'm surprised you found time to cook.
I managed.
Mm-hmm.
We missing something here?
Feeling a little cold chill coming from this side of the table.
What's going on?
Nothing anyone needs to know about.
See, Francis?
Hard enough having even one family some days.
Boys, take your plates and go eat in the kitchen.
So you guys can have a conversation we're not supposed to hear?
That's exactly right, Jack.
Go on.
Come on, I'll eat with you.
Go easy on this, Pop.
I'm not going to pussyfoot around this.
What kind of cop has two families?
What?
Who?
The one that got killed?
Yeah.
Yeah,
Steve Tomlin.
He had a wife and two kids in Staten Island and a girlfriend with a newborn baby in Jersey.
LINDA:
And you didn't know?
Steve is in your squad.
He was in my squad and I'm friendly with him, but pretty much nobody knew what was going on with him.
Well, you know what, one of those women knew what was going on, and it was probably the girlfriend.
So she doesn't deserve any sympathy?
He's the father of her kid.
No, that's not what I'm saying, Jamie.
Maybe he was that good of a catch that they were happy to share him.
(chuckles) (scoffs)
I personally just try to figure out where a man finds the time or energy to carry on with two families.
You-you looking for some tips?
DANNY:
No, I'm not looking for tips.
I'm just saying it's a mess.
Which isn't over.
Right, the funeral.
Well, you can count me out.
And we will.
Oh, come on, Grandpa.
We don't really know what was going on with Tomlin's life.
I mean, maybe he was making the best of a bad situation, you know?
You saying you excuse what he did?
No, I'm just saying I'm reserving judgment until the smoke clears a little.
Exactly.
I got personal items for two different women.
Some need to go to the girlfriend.
Mmm, kind of got to side with Gramps on this one.
Thank you.
There's a line, and men know where it's drawn.
You're also the cop on the case.
Well, then I'll deliver whatever I need to.
Thank you, Danny.
You got it, Dad.
(siren chirping)
Guess what sector we got this morning.
Judging by the smile on your face, Restaurant Row.
Back to Hell's Kitchen.
Really?
Boss says we did great.
15 summonses and a felony collar.
And I volunteered us since I know you want to find Tyler again.
Says who?
Your niece put you on the case.
Yeah, until my sister blew a gasket.
Sergeant.
Come on, friend of Nicky's or not, that kid needs help.
So let's go find him again.
But he's not gonna be hanging around Hell's Kitchen.
Not after he knows we're looking for him.
Yeah, I thought the same thing till I talked to a couple of guys in Narcotics who executed a warrant on a drug spot on that very same block this morning.
And guess who was seen running from the scene.
Well, let's go look for Tyler.
I knew I loved him from the moment we met.
He moved me here,
(baby cries) and pretty soon she was on the way.
And now it's just us two.
I'm sorry it took so long, with all the... issues around Steve.
Issues?
Did Steve stay home every night?
No, he was undercover.
Had to be gone a lot.
Did he wear a ring?
No, why would he?
He was single.
Detective, what-what are you saying?
I'm saying that Steve Tomlin was married.
No.
He had two kids.
Both in their 20s.
No.
You're wrong.
He w... he was with me.
We were going to get married, just-just as soon as-as... as soon as...
I'm sorry.
Regardless of whether or not he was married, it's obvious that he loved you.
(scoffs) You're defending him?
Surprises me, too.
Look, Steve could have abandoned the both of you, but he didn't.
In fact, you should probably take a look at this.
It was in his locker, too.
"Deferred compensation."
Kind of like a pension.
Cop gets to choose who the beneficiaries are, and Steve chose the both of you.
So Angela will be taken care of?
I'm not sure if he filed it.
But it's obvious that he wanted the both of you to be taken care of.
Do you think...
he would've done that if he didn't love you very much?
Tyler Jeffries?
Police!
(panting):
Stop!
Hold it right there.
Let me go.
Please.
Please let me go.
Please.
Why?
So you can go get high again?
Aw, sorry, buddy, those days are over.
Yeah.
Along with shoving police officers, which, by the way, is assault.
Hey.
We tried this the easy way.
Now you get the hard way.
You got anything sharp in your pockets, like a needle?
Anything that's gonna stick me?
Look, I-I don't do drugs.
Yeah, that's not what my niece says.
Look, I, I was a screwup at school, okay?
But I stopped all that.
I swear.
Yeah?
What were you passing around with your pals back there?
Your report card with all As?
Huh?
It was... it was her photo.
To see if anyone's seen her.
"Her" who, huh?
Whoa, whoa.
It's just a picture.
My mom... came down here a week ago to score and never came back home.
She's the junkie.
Thanks for bringing these.
The girls'll be happy to know their father kept them so close.
(sighs)
I'm just trying to carry out what...
I think he'd want.
Steve was a hell of a cop, and I honor that.
It's all he ever wanted to be.
Well, I'll be sure and say that when I stand up for him at the funeral.
And if there's anything else my department can do...
I only have to ask.
Can I ask this?
Could you please not lie to me, Commissioner?
Steve's lies were bad enough, but to have all of you parade around here with your sad smiles and your pats on the back for the poor widow... and nobody has the guts to admit what I've known for the past year?
I'm not sure I understand.
(short laugh) Of course.
Once I knew, I did what every good wife does.
Blamed myself.
Tried to make him love me again.
I mean, I...
I do love the guy.
And the only time I lost it was when I...
I'd had too much to drink and I...
I found his phone and I called the number I didn't recognize and I told the bitch off.
Told her I was the one who had stuck by him all these years and raised his family while he was out on the job.
And I hung up the phone before she could get a word in edgewise.
(sighs)
I'm very sorry.
You know what you could do?
Skip Steve's funeral.
Just skip the nice speech about how honor is such a big part of the job.
How the NYPD appreciates the sacrifices made by the families.
You might be able to get the words out, but I, for one, don't want to hear them.
His real family doesn't want to hear it.
Can you do that for me?
Good-bye, Commissioner.
(door opens)
Frank.
I've got good news.
I could use some.
Corporation counsel reviewed Steve Tomlin's financials.
He filled out his deferred compensation papers but never submitted them, so they're invalid.
The Staten Island family will get all the money and benefits.
And how is that good news?
Well, the last thing this office needs is legal wrangling with an irate widow.
Or lurid headlines about a two-timing cop.
So it's good news for this office?
What about Marianna and their baby?
Well, technically, they're not his family.
Technically?
I don't blame them.
Doesn't take a ring to make a family.
I tried to give you an out, Frank.
But you chose to be mixed up in this.
I'm just telling you where we are.
On the high moral ground, apparently.
That's not fair.
None of this is.
That's no excuse to turn our backs on a woman with a cop's baby.
Look, if you can fire a way to help out both families, I'm all ears.
As far as I see it, the department's hands are tied.
You really sure I should be here?
I called your mom to ask her, but she didn't answer, so...
No, I mean because I lied to you.
We're good, Nicky.
And I think that Tyler could really use a friend right about now.
Tyler.
Oh, my God,
I thought you moved.
That's what I told everyone.
So they wouldn't know the truth.
Tyler's mom has been having some problems.
What do you mean?
First it was prescription drugs.
Then it became other stuff.
Ms. Jeffries disappeared about a week ago.
Tyler's been out looking for her.
Why didn't you let my mom help you?
Or my uncle?
Because then you'd find out, and... people at school.
(short laugh) But...
I guess they'll all find out anyway when it's in the papers that she's dead.
Tyler, we don't know that she is.
Then why can't I find her?
I've looked everywhere.
Because she's been in the hospital.
Accidental OD.
She's been a Jane Doe at Bellevue for a couple days.
Is there any way I can see her?
That's why I'm here.
So you did keep looking for her.
And your uncle is on his way down from Rhode Island.
You'll stay with him until your mom gets clean.
Thank you so much.
All of you.
We just did what she asked.
Come on.
I want a cape.
Ah.
(chuckles)
Cheers.
(exhales)
Yeah.
I need a little help here, Pop.
Is this about that Tomlin fellow?
His second family needs to be taken care of.
Wasn't that his job?
Well, he got himself killed in the line of duty before he got around to it.
So throw him a 10-13 party.
There is a three-month-old baby girl who's gonna grow up without a father.
And the problem does not get solved by some cash in a cigar box on a bar.
(door shuts)
DANNY:
Where is everyone?
In here.
HENRY (chuckling):
Oh.
Are you here to help your old man muscle me into pitching in?
If that's what's going on, I am now.
Come on, Pop.
You're on the board of the Policeman's Fund.
Yeah, so?
So it may be time to put some of that influence to good use, Gramps.
Create a back-pocket pension for one more widow and orphan.
Old dog, new tricks.
I haven't said yes.
You gonna say no?
(slow grunt)
So what's going on?
I went to see the girlfriend again to confirm that Tomlin's wife did in fact call her as she claimed.
Wait a minute.
The wife called the girlfriend?
The wife thought she called the girlfriend.
She found a number in Tomlin's cell phone.
She called it, thinking it would be the girlfriend on the other end.
Tomlin was undercover in Castillo's gang.
And unfortunately... (sighs)
She accidentally called one of them.
Yeah.
It was Tomlin's wife who blew his cover, Gramps.
Couple days later, we got a dead cop.
You got to be kidding me.
If I was kidding, someone would be laughing.
HENRY:
Good Lord.
She loses her husband and then has to hear this.
It'll kill the woman.
Unless she doesn't hear it.
I can't lie to that woman again.
She has to know.
Commissioner Reagan.
I need to talk to you, Mrs. Tomlin.
I've said everything I have to say.
Well,
I'm afraid I haven't.
I'm sorry, I got nothing for nobody.
I'm burying my husband tomorrow.
I didn't handle our meeting very well, yesterday, and I'm sorry.
But I think... (deep breath)
Steve would've wanted the NYPD represented at his service.
I know he would.
And it would be my honor to do that for him.
You came all the way out here just to ask me that?
Yes, I did.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
So, you finished 90 Dances, 90 Nations
Um... it's pretty great, right?
My dad's new girlfriend is quite the offer.
Yeah, I love it.
How did you...
I don't know... summarize the character to the plot?
You haven't read it, have you?
It's 800 pages of a woman recovering from her divorce by dancing around the globe.
Could you just give me the CliffsNotes, please?
My dad's bringing her by after lunch.
Well, it was subtle with its complex narrative
- and thematic prose.
- You didn't read it either.
It is 800 pages.
I've been trying to download the audio book for the last 12 hours.
Oh, hey, I cannot thank you guys enough for turning me on to Lily's book.
I mean, I may not be a middle-aged divorcée, but color me swept away.
Yeah, and all the dancing.
Dancing.
Dancing?
There was no dancing.
The dancing was a metaphor for her emotional catharsis.
Paco the farm boy makes that very clear in chapter 6.
You didn't read it.
Yeah, I didn't either.
You know me.
I drift reading the back of a mac and cheese box.
So, how is it going with Lily and your dad?
Um, pretty well, I think.
I mean, you know, he's cautious.
He likes to take things nice and slow.
Or slutty and quick.
Dad?
Oh!
Hey, gang.
May I present Ms. Lily Schecter, the author of 90 Dances, 90 Nations.
And I was worried that meeting all of you might be awkward.
So you must be Sydney.
I can tell because you look the most horrified.
No, no, we're just real excited to meet you.
- We loved your book.
- Couldn't put it down.
- Read it in a night.
- I actually read it.
Oh, how kind.
Did you have a favorite part?
- Yes I did, because I actually read it.
- Chapter 12.
Chen-Lu with the...
the Sea of Japan was...
Oh, so you're all liars.
It's okay.
I forgive you.
Well, I promise, 90 Dances, 90 Nations is at the top of my must-read list once I stop being a workaholic.
Oh, Sydney, if I could give you one piece of advice that I've learned on all of my life travels, it's that you have got to slow down a little bit.
You need to cut out some time for yourself.
You know, just take a breath and...
Balls!
I've got a meeting in 15 minutes.
It's at a women's shelter.
I mean, it's kind of a bummer because none of them can afford my book.
That was so mean.
I'm really a nice person.
- So we're on for Thursday?
- Absolutely.
It's a date.
No...
An adventure.
So, what's the big plan for the date on Thursday?
Nothing too fancy.
Only the greatest night of romance anyone ever had.
And of course, a magical ending.
Oh, I wouldn't put that much pressure on yourself.
The first time's not always magical.
Sometimes it's over really quick, but then you don't have to retake geometry.
Oh, there's a lot of story in that little sentence.
Does anyone else hear someone crying?
Yeah, I'd know those ugly walls anywhere.
That's Gordon.
Gordon, is that you cr...
Oh!
Timothy kicked me out.
My marriage is over.
That really hurt.

- Bubbe, what happened?
- I don't know, but I think I really hurt myself when I tripped...
Gordon, what happened?
I don't know what happened.
We were eating Thai food.
Everything was fine.
We were...
We were reading listicles on Buzzfeed.
- Yeah?
- "Top 25 Ways You Know You're a '90s Girl."
And that's when Timothy, he threw all my stuff out on the front lawn!
20 years!
We have a dog!
Don't you worry about Dr. Katherine Lewis Salazar Ruffington.
That dog is gonna be just fine.
Take the rest of the day off, okay?
Here.
Go to my place.
Get some sleep;
I'll check in on you later.
Do you think people will know I've been crying?
Oh, here, you know what?
You can wear my glasses.
Thank you.
I don't want them to make fun of me.
Get out of here, go, go, go.
Okay.
Oh.
Careful.
My, my...
Hey, buddy.
- Hey, friend.
- Oh...
- You dropped these.
- No, those aren't mine.
- So, how was that place for lunch?
- Are you...
Are you seriously just gonna leave them there?
Well, what do you do when you've lost something?
You retrace your steps.
First place they'll look:
floor of the elevator.
You're unbelievable.
Yeah, it's easier to turn a blind eye and look the other way,
- but as a society we rely on the...
- Look, may-maybe the keys... are supposed to stay on the floor.
All right, have you seen Back to the Future?
Do you remember the scene when Marty's mom gets all handsy with him in the car?
His sister's head disappears.
You want that on your conscience?
So you're equating picking up a set of keys with messing with the space-time continuum?
Let's just hope it's not too late already.
Okay, let me get this straight:
There were no infidelities?
- No drug or alcohol problems?
- Look, we were fine.
We even celebrated his birthday last week.
- What'd you do?
- What we always do.
I took him to Outback Steakhouse because he doesn't like rules.
And that was his idea?
No, he wanted me to sing Bearaoke.
It's like karaoke but with big, hairy, gay men.
I always thought that was karaoke with Barry Manilow songs.
That's Manilowke.
Anyway, after dinner, I gave him his Amazon gift card and everything seemed fine.
I just figured out the problem.
You're not spontaneous.
That's what Timothy says.
Why didn't you tell me that before I started guessing?
Because I thought you were looking for something secret.
Okay, l-look, here's what Timothy always complains about.
That I never like to go out anymore, that I never try, do, or eat anything new.
And that I still haven't gotten the mole on my back looked at.
Well, this is great news.
Not the mole... that's potentially fatal... but everything else I can help you with.
Spontaneity is my specialty.
- And you think that's gonna get him back?
- Of course.
We'll have you violating the sanctity of marriage in no time.
We'll start tomorrow.
- Okay, but I have to know what time.
- Oh, no, no.
I have a waxing...
- You can't plan spontaneity.
- Why would you do that?
- Think of the first thing that comes to mind.
- I didn't get insurance
- on the phone.
- That's a start.
Boys, in order to shake Gordon out of his comfort zone and help him win Timothy back, he's gonna be joining our brainstorming session.
Okay, our product is SmartSpecs.
It's basically a rip-off of Google Glass, except they look just like regular glasses.
Basically, it's a computer you wear on your face.
So you can search the Internet, take videos, whatever.
Gordon, hold these in your hand.
Now say the first thing that comes to mind.
Don't think.
I-I-I...
I don't know.
I'm not good at this.
Nonsense.
Anything that comes out of that Mardi Gras float you call a head is gonna be brilliant.
Okay, see, now, that was mean.
- Yet encouraging.
Thank you.
- Well, I want you to succeed.
You're my friend, okay?
Besides, I'm having a big date with Lily this weekend and I don't want you all up in my kitchen, all right?
So, go from your gut.
- What would you use these for?
- I-I... wouldn't know where to begin.
Um, you could do anything.
- That's it.
- What's it?
- You could do anything.
- Not much of a pitch.
Don't we have to be more specific?
Maybe you don't.
Maybe it's something new.
Maybe it's an anti-idea.
A celebration of vagueness.

Song sucks, right?
- Wow, was that bad.
- Hoo.
- Aw, I hated that.
- For real.
Oh, don't worry about me.
I'm fine.
- Oh, my God, is it broken?
- Well,
I-it's a sprain.
But the doctor used the word severe.
- In, what context?
- Well, he said it was a severely mild sprain.
But it's the worst kind.
Any more severe and it would have been officially moderate.
Well, he did give you crutches.
I-I might have picked them up on my own accord.
And a good patient is her own advocate.
Real or drama queen?
- Second one.
- Drama queen.
- Got it.
Hey, either of you ladies missing a set of keys?
Those belong to Jean from payroll.
- How do you know that?
- Well, see the little pair of jeans hanging from the keychain?
That's her signature, because her name is Jean.
Signatures don't have to be clever.
Who's Jean?
You don't know Jean?
They call her the human tick.
Okay, you can't talk to her, you can't even look at her.
Because she will take the smallest human interaction and attach to you like tick to deer.
I once held a door open for her and ended up invited to her cousin's wedding in Vermont.
I told him to... this is what happens when you have no respect
- for the space-time continuum.
- You know what?
The world I live in, a man returns a set of keys.
And wears a smart suit for airplane travel.
But one problem at a time.
Andrew Keaneally, are those my keys?
- Yes, they are.
- You are such a dear.
I was just looking for them in the elevator.
Retracing your steps.
- Yeah.
- Well, um, I should get going.
Oh, no, you don't.
I am buying you lunch as a thank you and I will not take no for an answer.
Gosh, I've already got lunch plans at my desk, alone.
- Great, I'll join you.
- Oh...
I was supposed to eat with Shirley but she's sick again today.
- What's wrong with her?
- Lyme disease.
7:55.
You want to make small talk like Timothy and I do before NCIS starts, at which point a cone of silence is triggered?
Hey, Gordon, how about we throw caution to the wind tonight, okay?
Have a little party?
I've got some new neighbors I want you to meet.
Oh, no, no.
No, I can't meet anybody I don't know already.
What was Timothy's number one complaint?
- You don't socialize.
- Well... well, that's 'cause I need to research people before I meet them.
You...
M...
You know, come on.
Oh, they're here.
Surprise!
- No time for research, got to improvise.
- No, no, Simon.
- What did you do?
Simon!
- Nothing.
- Do... don't get it.
- Shh.
Welcome, bienvenido, bonsoir.
- Cabaret, right?
- The Mac welcome screen.
Anna and Neal, my new neighbors, meet Gordon, my dear friend.
Gordie, tell them a little something about yourself.
I-I should be watching NCIS right now.
So the plan is get married here and then a ten-day honeymoon
- in Costa Rica.
- Honeymooning in Costa Rica?
Well, there's plenty to do there.
Many people enjoy the seaside community of Manuel Antonio and then go ziplining in the village town of Monteverde.
That's fantastic.
Is Manuel Antonio far from Monteverde?
Is Manuel Antonio far from Monteverde?
It's a two-and-a-half hour ride on a dirt road, but is also accessible via shuttles from most of the major hotels.
Look at you riffing.
You're like the Miles Davis of small talk.
You're killing it.
So, Neal, tell us, what's it like, growing up in Dearborn, Michigan?
- Well...
- I understand it was founded in 1786 and incorporated as a city in... scroll... 1929.
- Did you just say "scroll"?
- What?
No.
Scroll?
Hello?
I said "stroll."
As in, the residents of Dearborn, Michigan stroll through... reload page...
Ford Woods Park.
You're wearing SmartSpecs!
What are you talking about?
Open new tab.
Topic changers.
Give me those!
Give it to me.
Wait just a second.
Wait just a second.
You're cheating!
You're on Wikipedia!
And this page is not even verified!
I told you I'm not comfortable socializing in front of strangers.
Forgive me.
- Oh.
- What?
What is it?
- Nothing, nothing.
- No, no, don't tell me "nothing."
No, don't...
Don't!
Give it to me Give it to me.
Okay, it's an Instagram alert.
Timothy, how could you?
- Who's Timothy?
- My ex.
He posted a picture of our beagle,
Dr. Katherine Salazar Lewis Ruffington.
He took my last name out of the middle name of our dog.
Maybe Instagram has a character limit.
- No, that's Twitter.
- Shut up, Neal.
Doesn't mean anything, Gordon.
It means everything.
He's given up on us.
Doesn't mean you have to give up.
- It's done, Simon.
- No, no!
You don't know that, Gordon!
Come on now.
Now is not the time to throw in the tow.
Take a risk, show him how much you love him.
Win him back!
Oh, so you're the relationship expert now.
What are you, 0 for 5 in the marriages?
Six if you count my Moonie wedding.
But at least I tried.
And tried and tried.
And what have we learned?
That love doesn't last.
It dies.
No exceptions.
Except for you two.
Have a great time in Costa Rica, where... click link...
"some of the world's best tarpon fishing could be found on the Peñas Blancas."
I don't know what that means.
Hey, guys, you remember Jean.
Just had another lunch.
Jean just made me another vest.
It's a jean vest!
Like me, I'm Jean.
You get it?
I'll meet you at the elevators to carpool home.
That was our fourth lunch.
I returned the keys three days ago.
Guess what that means.
Lesson is learned.
Don't be nice, help no one.
I do not accept that.
You're not that guy.
I need you to be Andrew the Good.
We gotta find a way out of this Jean situation.
Well, all a tick needs is a good blood meal.
Maybe we just find her a new host.
These crutches are starting to hurt my shoulder.
Oh, no, you don't think it's the beginning of a mild rotator cuff injury, do you?
I hope not.
So, you created this menu yourself?
This is wonderful!
- Thank you.
- "First course, a seven-course French meal."
It's just a little confusing, but I love it.
"Second course, romance.
Third course, a magical ending"
Well, I wonder what that could be.
Simon?
Where are you?
You're really different tonight.
Is there something wrong?
Only that romance dies and love is a crock.
I'm having the fish.
How about you?
What happened to the guy who said that he wanted to sleep in late so he could have more dirty dreams about me?
He woke up.
Wow.
I, I thought this was actually going somewhere.
Let me tell you where this is going.
We go out a couple more times,
We start throwing the L-word around, we get married.
One morning I forget to take out the garbage, and suddenly you try to kill me with a kitchen knife.
So why don't we cut to the part where I say,
"Check please" and we spare each other years of misery?
Did someone order some magic?
You're early, Copperfield, and you're supposed to say "abracadabra."
- No one says that.
- Please tell me you're here to transform this horrible date into a good one.
This must be very embarrassing for you.
It sure is.
I'm leaving you now, Simon.
That's what they all say.
Wow, he's good.
Hello?
Sydney, is that you?
Dad?
Where have you been all day?
I was too despondent to come into work.
I'm sorry.
I thought I was calling Lauren's glasses.
I need her to bring my leather cap.
I'm doing Bearaoke with Timothy and I feel like an idiot without it.
Wait... you're doing Bearaoke?
No, I'm just gonna get a sandwich.
I'm talking to my dad.
Yeah, I called you.
What?
No.
Why are you despondent?
Well, yeah, it's this whole thing with Timothy and...
No, Gordon, I'm talking to my dad on the glasses.
He's despondent?
- Yes.
- Simon?
Simon, what's... what's wrong?
!
Okay, you know, why don't I give you the glasses and then you guys can just talk directly?
No!
He killed love!
Do not put me on that man's face!
- What?
- He doesn't want to talk to you.
- You killed love.
- Oh, that's crazy.
- Here, give me...
- No, stop!
Listen, Simon, what are you talking about, I killed...?
What happened?
I ended it with Lily.
What's the point?
Wh-wh-why?
You were so into her.
It doesn't matter.
Any relationship I've ever had, I believed it was "the one,"
because I knew what Gordon and Timothy had was possible.
If they can't make it, what chance do any of us have?
- Dad, that's...
- What is he saying?
Listen to me.
Let me see those.
- Dad?
- Let me see 'em.
- No, he hung up.
- Where is he?
I don't-I don't know.
He-he broke things off with Lily.
I can't believe it.
- Because of me?
- Yes.
That's horrible.
Okay, you can get out of my face now.
Oh, no.
Look at her.
So defenseless.
I got this door!
Good-bye, sweet Jean.
I don't know why I kissed them.
Very unsanitary.
Oh, wait.
Someone left their keys here.
Did anyone see my keys?
Sydney Roberts, you dear!
Thank you.
I am taking you to lunch, young lady!
Oh!
Like the weakest little antelope.
We had to sacrifice one for the good of the pack.
- She'll look adorable in a jean skirt.
- Hey, Syd, if you're not doing anything this weekend...
I have plans.
For the next 48 weekends, I'm booked.
Oh, of course.
You're probably in physical therapy for your ankle.
Oh, actually, they said I didn't need it.
They don't know anything.
That is a moderate sprain if I've ever seen one.
You know, that's what I said!
Yeah.
What do you know about rotator cuff injuries?
They need to be taken seriously.
Match made in heaven.

So many worms died to make Gordie's.
Okay, next up, we've got Gordon singing
Miley Cyrus' "Wrecking Ball"!
Hey, everybody.
I have a straight friend...
Shh.
Come on.
Everyone needs one.
Who falls in love so completely, it-it's so stupid but great.
And if he believes that... me and Timothy can make it through all this, then I have to believe our love is not dead.

Lily.
Hi, Simon.
You are aware it's after 1:00 in the morning.
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah.
What do you want?
A very close gay friend of mine just got back together with his partner, and I'm feeling positive about love again.
What do you say?
Let's press the reset button?
You know, I've always considered myself an... open-minded kind of free spirit.
In fact, I...
I was in a committed throuple with Woody Harrelson and his wife for three and a half months.
- Wow.
- But I have never met anybody as screwy as you.
Y-You're like...
you're like an alien.
- Really?
- Call me when you get your meds right.
I'll take that as a maybe.
I'm feeling hopeful again.
How'd you get in here?
!
Get out!
I don't know how you did that, Copperfield, but it's too little, too late.
I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to help.
It'd help if you picked up your cues.
- This is officially the last favor I do for you.
- Don't I get three wishes?
- I'm not a genie.
- I wish I was taller.
- I'm not a genie.
- You're still going back in your bottle.

- Hey, Lily.
- Hello, Simanyin.
Oh, I got to knock on the door first.
Oh.
Something equally at home on a midnight stroll or during the horizontal mambo.
On the Fertile Crescent.
- Or doing the Bone Dance.
- Oh.

Oh, I hope those are your keys.
So, you finished 90 Dances, 90 Nations huh?
Um... ***
My dad's new girlfriend is quite the offer.
Yeah, I love it.
How did you...
I don't know... summarize the character to the plot?
You haven't read it, have you?
(sighs) It's 800 pages of a woman recovering from her divorce by dancing around the globe.
Could you just give me the CliffsNotes, please?
My dad's bringing her by after lunch.
Well, it was subtle with its complex narrative
- and thematic prose.
- You didn't read it either.
It is 800 pages.
I've been trying to download the audio book for the last 12 hours.
ANDREW:
Oh, hey, I cannot thank you guys enough for turning me on to Lily's book.
I mean, I may not be a middle-aged divorcée, but color me swept away.
Yeah, and all the dancing.
Dancing.
Dancing?
There was no dancing.
The dancing was a metaphor for her emotional catharsis.
Paco the farm boy makes that very clear in chapter 6.
You didn't read it.
Yeah, I didn't either.
You know me.
I drift reading the back of a mac and cheese box.
So, how is it going with Lily and your dad?
Um, pretty well, I think.
I mean, you know, he's cautious.
He likes to take things nice and slow.
(elevator bell dings)
Or slutty and quick.
(clears throat) Dad?
(gasps) Oh!
Hey, gang.
May I present Ms. Lily Schecter, the author of 90 Dances, 90 Nations.
And I was worried that meeting all of you might be awkward.
(laughter)
So you must be Sydney.
I can tell because you look the most horrified.
Uh, no, no, we're just real excited to meet you.
- We loved your book.
- Couldn't put it down.
- Read it in a night.
- I actually read it.
Oh, how kind.
Did you have a favorite part?
- Yes I did, because I actually read it.
- Chapter 12.
Chen-Lu with the...
the Sea of Japan was...
Oh, so you're all liars.
It's okay.
I forgive you.
Well, I promise, 90 Dances, 90 Nations is at the top of my must-read list once I stop being a workaholic.
Oh, Sydney, if I could give you one piece of advice that I've learned on all of my life travels, it's that you have got to slow down a little bit.
You need to cut out some time for yourself.
You know, just take a breath and... (gasps) Balls!
I've got a meeting in 15 minutes.
It's at a women's shelter.
I mean, it's kind of a bummer because none of them can afford my book.
That was so mean.
I'm really a nice person.
So we're on for Thursday?
Absolutely.
It's a date.
No...
An adventure.
(hisses)
So, what's the big plan for the date on Thursday?
Nothing too fancy.
Only the greatest night of romance anyone ever had.
And of course, a magical ending.
Oh, I wouldn't put that much pressure on yourself.
The first time's not always magical.
Sometimes it's over really quick, but then you don't have to retake geometry.
Oh, there's a lot of story in that little sentence.
(man sobbing) Does anyone else hear someone crying?
Yeah, I'd know those ugly walls anywhere.
That's Gordon.
Gordon, is that you cr...
Oh!
(grunts)
(groans) Timothy kicked me out.
My marriage is over.
Ow!
That really hurt.

- Bubbe, what happened?
- I don't know, but I think I really hurt myself when I tripped...
Gordon, what happened?
I don't know what happened.
- We were eating Thai food.
- Uh-huh.
Everything was fine.
We were...
We were reading listicles on Buzzfeed.
- Yeah?
- "Top 25 Ways You Know You're a '90s Girl."
And that's when Timothy, he threw all my stuff out on the front lawn!
(sobs) 20 years!
We have a dog!
Don't you worry about Dr. Katherine Lewis Salazar Ruffington.
That dog is gonna be just fine.
Take the rest of the day off, okay?
Here.
Go to my place.
Get some sleep;
I'll check in on you later.
Do you think people will know I've been crying?
Oh, here, you know what?
You can wear my glasses.
(sighs)
Thank you.
I don't want them to make fun of me.
Get out of here, go, go, go.
Okay.
Oh.
Careful.
My, my... (sighs)
Hey, buddy.
- Hey, friend.
- Oh...
- You dropped these.
- No, those aren't mine.
- So, how was that place for lunch?
- Are you...
Are you seriously just gonna leave them there?
Well, what do you do when you've lost something?
You retrace your steps.
First place they'll look:
floor of the elevator.
You're unbelievable.
Uh, yeah, it's easier to turn a blind eye and look the other way,
- but as a society we rely on the...
- Look, may-maybe the keys... are supposed to stay on the floor.
All right, have you seen Back to the Future?
Do you remember the scene when Marty's mom gets all handsy with him in the car?
His sister's head disappears.
You want that on your conscience?
So you're equating picking up a set of keys with messing with the space-time continuum?
Let's just hope it's not too late already.
SIMON:
Okay, let me get this straight:
There were no infidelities?
No drug or alcohol problems?
Look, we were fine.
We even celebrated his birthday last week.
What'd you do?
What we always do.
I took him to Outback Steakhouse because he doesn't like rules.
And that was his idea?
No, he wanted me to sing Bearaoke.
It's like karaoke but with big, hairy, gay men.
I always thought that was karaoke with Barry Manilow songs.
That's Manilowke.
Ah.
Anyway, after dinner, I gave him his Amazon gift card and everything seemed fine.
I just figured out the problem.
You're not spontaneous.
That's what Timothy says.
Why didn't you tell me that before I started guessing?
Because I thought you were looking for something secret.
Okay, l-look, here's what Timothy always complains about.
That I never like to go out anymore, that I never try, do, or eat anything new.
And that I still haven't gotten the mole on my back looked at.
Well, this is great news.
Not the mole... that's potentially fatal... but everything else I can help you with.
Spontaneity is my specialty.
- And you think that's gonna get him back?
- Of course.
We'll have you violating the sanctity of marriage in no time.
We'll start tomorrow.
- Okay, but I have to know what time.
- Oh, no, no.
I have a waxing...
(glass shatters)
- You can't plan spontaneity.
- Why would you do that?
Think of the first thing that comes to mind.
I didn't get insurance
- on the phone.
- That's a start.
Boys, in order to shake Gordon out of his comfort zone and help him win Timothy back, he's gonna be joining our brainstorming session.
Okay, our product is SmartSpecs.
It's basically a rip-off of Google Glass,
- except they look just like - regular glasses.
Mm-hmm.
Basically, it's a computer you wear on your face.
So you can search the Internet, take videos, whatever.
Gordon, hold these in your hand.
- Mm-hmm.
- Now say the first thing that comes to mind.
Don't think.
I-I-I...
I don't know.
I'm not good at this.
Nonsense.
Anything that comes out of that Mardi Gras float you call a head is gonna be brilliant.
Okay, see, now, that was mean.
- Yet encouraging.
Thank you.
- Well, I want you to succeed.
You're my friend, okay?
Besides, I'm having a big date with Lily this weekend and I don't want you all up in my kitchen, all right?
So, go from your gut.
- What would you use these for?
- I-I... wouldn't know where to begin.
Um, you could do anything.
- That's it.
- What's it?
- You could do anything.
- Not much of a pitch.
Don't we have to be more specific?
Maybe you don't.
Maybe it's something new.
Maybe it's an anti-idea.
A celebration of vagueness.

For real.
(speaks indistinctly) (grunting)
Oh, don't worry about me.
(chuckles) I'm fine.
- Oh, my God, is it broken?
- Well,
I-it's a sprain.
But the doctor used the word severe.
- In, uh, what context?
- Well, he said it was a severely mild sprain.
But it's the worst kind.
Any more severe and it would have been officially moderate.
Well, he did give you crutches.
I-I might have picked them up on my own accord.
And a good patient is her own advocate.
Real or drama queen?

Drama queen.

Hey, either of you ladies missing a set of keys?
Those belong to Jean from payroll.
- How do you know that?
- Well, see the little pair of jeans hanging from the keychain?
That's her signature, because her name is Jean.
Signatures don't have to be clever.
Who's Jean?
You don't know Jean?
They call her the human tick.
Okay, you can't talk to her, you can't even look at her.
Because she will take the smallest human interaction and attach to you like tick to deer.
I once held a door open for her and ended up invited to her cousin's wedding in Vermont.
I told him to... this is what happens when you have no respect for the space-time continuum.
You know what?
The world I live in, a man returns a set of keys.
And wears a smart suit for airplane travel.
But one problem at a time.
(exhales)
(whistling)
Andrew Keaneally, are those my keys?
Yes, they are.
You are such a dear.
I was just looking for them in the elevator.
Ah.
Retracing your steps.
Yeah.
Well, um, I should get going.
Oh, no, you don't.
I am buying you lunch as a thank you and I will not take no for an answer.
Gosh, I've already got lunch plans at my desk, alone.
Great, I'll join you.
Oh...
I was supposed to eat with Shirley but she's sick again today.
What's wrong with her?
Lyme disease.
7:55.
You want to make small talk like Timothy and I do before NCIS starts, at which point a cone of silence is triggered?
Hey, Gordon, how about we throw caution to the wind tonight, okay?
Have a little party?
I've got some new neighbors I want you to meet.
Oh, uh, uh, uh, no, no.
No, I can't meet anybody I don't know already.
What was Timothy's number one complaint?
You don't socialize.
Well-well, that's 'cause I need to research people before I meet them.
You...
M...
You know, come on.
(doorbell rings)
Oh, they're here.
Surprise!
No time for research, got to improvise.
No, no, Simon.
What did you do?
Simon!
Nothing.
Do-don't get it.
Shh.
Welcome, bienvenido, bonsoir.
Cabaret, right?
The Mac welcome screen.
Anna and Neal, my new neighbors, meet Gordon, my dear friend.
Gordie, tell them a little something about yourself.
I-I should be watching NCIS right now.
Huh.
So the plan is get married here and then a ten-day honeymoon
- in Costa Rica.
- Honeymooning in Costa Rica?
Well, there's plenty to do there.
Many people enjoy the seaside community of Manuel Antonio and then go ziplining in the village town of Monteverde.
That's fantastic.
Is Manuel Antonio far from Monteverde?
Is Manuel Antonio far from Monteverde?
It's a two-and-a-half hour ride on a dirt road, but is also accessible via shuttles from most of the major hotels.
Look at you riffing.
You're like the Miles Davis of small talk.
You're killing it.
So, Neal, tell us, what's it like, uh, growing up in Dearborn, Michigan?
Well...
I understand it was founded in 1786 and incorporated as a city in... scroll... 1929.
- Did you just say "scroll"?
- What?
No.
Scroll?
Hello?
(laughs)
I said "stroll."
As in, the residents of Dearborn, Michigan stroll through... reload page...

You're wearing SmartSpecs!
What are you talking about?

Give me those!
Give it to me.
Wait just a second.
Wait just a second.
You're cheating!
You're on Wikipedia!
And this page is not even verified!
I told you I'm not comfortable socializing in front of strangers.
Forgive me.
Uh-oh.
What?
What is it?
Nothing, nothing.
No, no, don't tell me "nothing."
No, don't...
Don't!
Give it to me Give it to me.
- Okay, it's an Instagram alert.
- Mm-hmm.
Timothy, how could you?
- Who's Timothy?
- My ex.
He posted a picture of our beagle,
Dr. Katherine Salazar Lewis Ruffington.
He took my last name out of the middle name of our dog.
Maybe Instagram has a character limit.
- No, that's Twitter.
- Shut up, Neal.
Doesn't mean anything, Gordon.
It means everything.
He's given up on us.
Doesn't mean you have to give up.
- It's done, Simon.
- No, no!
You don't know that, Gordon!
Come on now.
Now is not the time to throw in the tow.
Take a risk, show him how much you love him.
Win him back!
Oh, so you're the relationship expert now.
What are you, 0 for 5 in the marriages?
Six if you count my Moonie wedding.
But at least I tried.
And tried and tried.
And what have we learned?
That love doesn't last.
It dies.
No exceptions.
Except for you two.
Have a great time in Costa Rica, where... click link...
"some of the world's best tarpon fishing could be found on the Peñas Blancas."
I don't know what that means.
(speaks indistinctly)
Hey, guys, you remember Jean.
Just had another lunch.
Jean just made me another vest.
It's a jean vest!
Like me, I'm Jean.
You get it?
I'll meet you at the elevators to carpool home.
That was our fourth lunch.
I returned the keys three days ago.
Guess what that means.
Lesson is learned.
Don't be nice, help no one.
I do not accept that.
You're not that guy.
I need you to be Andrew the Good.
We gotta find a way out of this Jean situation.
Well, all a tick needs is a good blood meal.
Maybe we just find her a new host.
SYDNEY:
These crutches are starting to hurt my shoulder.
Oh, no, you don't think it's the beginning of a mild rotator cuff injury, do you?
MAN:
I hope not.
So, you created this menu yourself?
Mm-hmm.
This is wonderful!
Thank you.
"First course, a seven-course French meal."
It's just a little confusing, but I love it.
(chuckles)
"Second course, romance.
Third course, a magical ending""
Well, I wonder what that could be.
Simon?
Hmm?
Where are you?
You're really different tonight.
Is there something wrong?
Only that romance dies and love is a crock.
I'm having the fish.
How about you?
What happened to the guy who said that he wanted to sleep in late so he could have more dirty dreams about me?
He woke up.
Wow.
I, uh, I thought this was actually going somewhere.

That's what they all say.
Wow, he's good.

(ringing continues, Sydney grunts)
Hello?
Sydney, is that you?
- Dad?
- Mm-hmm.
Where have you been all day?
I was too despondent to come into work.
I'm sorry.
I thought I was calling Lauren's glasses.
I need her to bring my leather cap.
I'm doing Bearaoke with Timothy and I feel like an idiot without it.
Wait... you're doing Bearaoke?
No, I'm just gonna get a sandwich.
I'm talking to my dad.
Yeah, I called you.
- Huh?
- What?
No.
Why are you despondent?
Well, yeah, it's this whole thing with Timothy and...
No, Gordon, I'm talking to my dad on the glasses.
He's despondent?
Yes.
Simon?
Simon, what's... what's wrong?
!
Okay, you know, why don't I give you the glasses and then you guys can just talk directly?
No!
He killed love!
Do not put me on that man's face!
What?
He doesn't want to talk to you.
- You killed love.
- Oh, that's crazy.
- Here, give me...
- No, stop!
Listen, Simon, what are you talking about, I killed...?
What happened?
I ended it with Lily.
What's the point?
Wh-wh-why?
You were so into her.
It doesn't matter.
Any relationship I've ever had, I believed it was "the one,"
because I knew what Gordon and Timothy had was possible.
If they can't make it, what chance do any of us have?
Dad, that's...
What is he saying?
GORDON:
Listen to me.
Let me see those.
Dad?
Let me see 'em.
- No, he hung up.
- Where is he?
I don't-I don't know.
He-He broke things off with Lily.
I can't believe it.
- Because of me?
- Yes.
That's horrible.
Okay, you can get out of my face now.
Oh, no.
Look at her.
So defenseless.
I got this door!
(grunts)
Good-bye, sweet Jean.
I don't know why I kissed them.
Very unsanitary.
Oh, wait.
Someone left their keys here.
Did anyone see my keys?
Sydney Roberts, you dear!
Thank you.
I am taking you to lunch, young lady!
Oh!
Like the weakest little antelope.
We had to sacrifice one for the good of the pack.
She'll look adorable in a jean skirt.
Hey, Syd, if you're not doing anything this weekend...
I have plans.
For the next 48 weekends, I'm booked.
Oh, of course.
You're probably in physical therapy for your ankle.
Oh, actually, they said I didn't need it.
They don't know anything.
That is a moderate sprain if I've ever seen one.
You know, that's what I said!
Yeah.
What do you know about rotator cuff injuries?
They need to be taken seriously.
Match made in heaven.

Lily.
Hi, Simon.
You are aware it's after 1:00 in the morning.
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah.
What do you want?
A very close gay friend of mine just got back together with his partner, and I'm feeling positive about love again.
What do you say?
Let's press the reset button, huh?
You know, I've always considered myself an... open-minded kind of free spirit.
- Mm-hmm.
- In fact, I-I was in a committed throuple with Woody Harrelson and his wife for three and a half months.
- Wow.
- But I have never met anybody as screwy as you.
(chuckles) Y-You're like...
you're like an alien.
- Really?
- Call me when you get your meds right.
I'll take that as a maybe.
(groans)
I'm feeling hopeful again.
(woman screams)
MAN:
How'd you get in here?
!
WOMAN:
Get out!
I don't know how you did that, Copperfield, but it's too little, too late.
I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to help.
It'd help if you picked up your cues.
This is officially the last favor I do for you.
- Don't I get three wishes?
- I wish I was taller.
- I'm not a genie.
- I'm not a genie.
- You're still going back in your bottle.
- Hey, Lily.
- Hello, Simanyin.
(slurred gibberish)
(mocking sounds)
Oh, I got to knock on the door first.
Oh.
(laughs)
Something equally at home on a midnight stroll or during the horizontal mambo.
On the Fertile Crescent.
- Or doing the Bone Dance.
- Oh.

Oh, I hope those are your keys.
(laughter)
So, you finished 90 Dances, 90 Nations huh?
Um... it's pretty great, right?
My dad's new girlfriend is quite the offer.
Yeah, I love it.
How did you...
I don't know... summarize the character to the plot?
You haven't read it, have you?
(sighs) It's 800 pages of a woman recovering from her divorce by dancing around the globe.
Could you just give me the CliffsNotes, please?
My dad's bringing her by after lunch.
Well, it was subtle with its complex narrative
- and thematic prose.
- You didn't read it either.
It is 800 pages.
I've been trying to download the audio book for the last 12 hours.
ANDREW:
Oh, hey, I cannot thank you guys enough for turning me on to Lily's book.
I mean, I may not be a middle-aged divorcée, but color me swept away.
Yeah, and all the dancing.
Dancing.
Dancing?
There was no dancing.
The dancing was a metaphor for her emotional catharsis.
Paco the farm boy makes that very clear in chapter 6.
You didn't read it.
Yeah, I didn't either.
You know me.
I drift reading the back of a mac and cheese box.
So, how is it going with Lily and your dad?
Um, pretty well, I think.
I mean, you know, he's cautious.
He likes to take things nice and slow.
(elevator bell dings)
Or slutty and quick.
(clears throat) Dad?
(gasps) Oh!
Hey, gang.
May I present Ms. Lily Schecter, the author of 90 Dances, 90 Nations.
And I was worried that meeting all of you might be awkward.
(laughter)
So you must be Sydney.
I can tell because you look the most horrified.
Uh, no, no, we're just real excited to meet you.
- We loved your book.
- Couldn't put it down.
- Read it in a night.
- I actually read it.
Oh, how kind.
Did you have a favorite part?
- Yes I did, because I actually read it.
- Chapter 12.
Chen-Lu with the...
the Sea of Japan was...
Oh, so you're all liars.
It's okay.
I forgive you.
Well, I promise, 90 Dances, 90 Nations is at the top of my must-read list once I stop being a workaholic.
Oh, Sydney, if I could give you one piece of advice that I've learned on all of my life travels, it's that you have got to slow down a little bit.
You need to cut out some time for yourself.
You know, just take a breath and... (gasps) Balls!
I've got a meeting in 15 minutes.
It's at a women's shelter.
I mean, it's kind of a bummer because none of them can afford my book.
That was so mean.
I'm really a nice person.
- So we're on for Thursday?
- Absolutely.
It's a date.
No...
An adventure.
(hisses)
So, what's the big plan for the date on Thursday?
Nothing too fancy.
Only the greatest night of romance anyone ever had.
And of course, a magical ending.
Oh, I wouldn't put that much pressure on yourself.
The first time's not always magical.
Sometimes it's over really quick, but then you don't have to retake geometry.
Oh, there's a lot of story in that little sentence.
(man sobbing) Does anyone else hear someone crying?
Yeah, I'd know those ugly walls anywhere.
That's Gordon.
Gordon, is that you cr...
Oh!

My marriage is over.
Ow!

- Bubbe, what happened?
- I don't know, but I think I really hurt myself when I tripped...
Gordon, what happened?
I don't know what happened.
- We were eating Thai food.
- Uh-huh.
Everything was fine.
We were...
We were reading listicles on Buzzfeed.
- Yeah?
- "Top 25 Ways You Know You're a '90s Girl."
And that's when Timothy, he threw all my stuff out on the front lawn!
(sobs) 20 years!
We have a dog!
Don't you worry about Dr. Katherine Lewis Salazar Ruffington.
That dog is gonna be just fine.
Take the rest of the day off, okay?
Here.
Go to my place.
Get some sleep;
I'll check in on you later.
Do you think people will know I've been crying?
Oh, here, you know what?
You can wear my glasses.
(sighs)
Thank you.
I don't want them to make fun of me.
Get out of here, go, go, go.
Okay.
Oh.
Careful.
My, my... (sighs)
Hey, buddy.
- Hey, friend.
- Oh...
- You dropped these.
- No, those aren't mine.
- So, how was that place for lunch?
- Are you...
Are you seriously just gonna leave them there?
Well, what do you do when you've lost something?
You retrace your steps.
First place they'll look:
floor of the elevator.
You're unbelievable.
Uh, yeah, it's easier to turn a blind eye and look the other way,
- but as a society we rely on the...
- Look, may-maybe the keys... are supposed to stay on the floor.
All right, have you seen Back to the Future?
Do you remember the scene when Marty's mom gets all handsy with him in the car?
His sister's head disappears.
You want that on your conscience?
So you're equating picking up a set of keys with messing with the space-time continuum?
Let's just hope it's not too late already.
SIMON:
Okay, let me get this straight:
There were no infidelities?
- No drug or alcohol problems?
- Look, we were fine.
We even celebrated his birthday last week.
- What'd you do?
- What we always do.
I took him to Outback Steakhouse because he doesn't like rules.
And that was his idea?
No, he wanted me to sing Bearaoke.
It's like karaoke but with big, hairy, gay men.
I always thought that was karaoke with Barry Manilow songs.
That's Manilowke.
Ah.
Anyway, after dinner, I gave him his Amazon gift card and everything seemed fine.
I just figured out the problem.
You're not spontaneous.
That's what Timothy says.
Why didn't you tell me that before I started guessing?
Because I thought you were looking for something secret.
Okay, l-look, here's what Timothy always complains about.
That I never like to go out anymore, that I never try, do, or eat anything new.
And that I still haven't gotten the mole on my back looked at.
Well, this is great news.
Not the mole... that's potentially fatal... but everything else I can help you with.
Spontaneity is my specialty.
- And you think that's gonna get him back?
- Of course.
We'll have you violating the sanctity of marriage in no time.
We'll start tomorrow.
- Okay, but I have to know what time.
- Oh, no, no.
I have a waxing...
(glass shatters)
- You can't plan spontaneity.
- Why would you do that?
- Think of the first thing that comes to mind.
- I didn't get insurance
- on the phone.
- That's a start.
Boys, in order to shake Gordon out of his comfort zone and help him win Timothy back, he's gonna be joining our brainstorming session.
Okay, our product is SmartSpecs.
It's basically a rip-off of Google Glass,
- except they look just like regular glasses.
- Mm-hmm.
Basically, it's a computer you wear on your face.
So you can search the Internet, take videos, whatever.
- Gordon, hold these in your hand.
- Mm-hmm.
Now say the first thing that comes to mind.
Don't think.
I-I-I...
I don't know.
I'm not good at this.
Nonsense.
Anything that comes out of that Mardi Gras float you call a head is gonna be brilliant.
Okay, see, now, that was mean.
- Yet encouraging.
Thank you.
- Well, I want you to succeed.
You're my friend, okay?
Besides, I'm having a big date with Lily this weekend and I don't want you all up in my kitchen, all right?
So, go from your gut.
- What would you use these for?
- I-I... wouldn't know where to begin.
Um, you could do anything.
- That's it.
- What's it?
- You could do anything.
- Not much of a pitch.
Don't we have to be more specific?
Maybe you don't.
Maybe it's something new.
Maybe it's an anti-idea.
A celebration of vagueness.

(speaks indistinctly) (grunting)
Oh, don't worry about me.
(chuckles) I'm fine.
- Oh, my God, is it broken?
- Well,
I-it's a sprain.
But the doctor used the word severe.
- In, uh, what context?
- Well, he said it was a severely mild sprain.
But it's the worst kind.
Any more severe and it would have been officially moderate.
Well, he did give you crutches.
I-I might have picked them up on my own accord.
And a good patient is her own advocate.
Real or drama queen?
- Second one.
- Drama queen.
- Got it.
Hey, either of you ladies missing a set of keys?
Those belong to Jean from payroll.
- How do you know that?
- Well, see the little pair of jeans hanging from the keychain?
That's her signature, because her name is Jean.
Signatures don't have to be clever.
Who's Jean?
You don't know Jean?
They call her the human tick.
Okay, you can't talk to her, you can't even look at her.
Because she will take the smallest human interaction and attach to you like tick to deer.
I once held a door open for her and ended up invited to her cousin's wedding in Vermont.
I told him to... this is what happens when you have no respect
- for the space-time continuum.
- You know what?
The world I live in, a man returns a set of keys.
And wears a smart suit for airplane travel.
But one problem at a time.
(exhales)
(whistling)
Andrew Keaneally, are those my keys?
- Yes, they are.
- You are such a dear.
I was just looking for them in the elevator.
Ah.
Retracing your steps.
- Yeah.
- Well, um, I should get going.
Oh, no, you don't.
I am buying you lunch as a thank you and I will not take no for an answer.
Gosh, I've already got lunch plans at my desk, alone.
- Great, I'll join you.
- Oh...
I was supposed to eat with Shirley but she's sick again today.
- What's wrong with her?
- Lyme disease.
7:55.
You want to make small talk like Timothy and I do before NCIS starts, at which point a cone of silence is triggered?
Hey, Gordon, how about we throw caution to the wind tonight, okay?
Have a little party?
I've got some new neighbors I want you to meet.
Oh, uh, uh, uh, no, no.
No, I can't meet anybody I don't know already.
What was Timothy's number one complaint?
- You don't socialize.
- Well... well, that's 'cause I need to research people before I meet them.
You...
M...
You know, come on.
(doorbell rings)
Oh, they're here.
Surprise!
- No time for research, got to improvise.
- No, no, Simon.
- What did you do?
Simon!
- Nothing.
- Do... don't get it.
- Shh.
Welcome, bienvenido, bonsoir.
- Cabaret, right?
- The Mac welcome screen.
Anna and Neal, my new neighbors, meet Gordon, my dear friend.
Gordie, tell them a little something about yourself.
I-I should be watching NCIS right now.
Huh.
So the plan is get married here and then a ten-day honeymoon
- in Costa Rica.
- Honeymooning in Costa Rica?
Well, there's plenty to do there.
Many people enjoy the seaside community of Manuel Antonio and then go ziplining in the village town of Monteverde.
That's fantastic.
Is Manuel Antonio far from Monteverde?
Is Manuel Antonio far from Monteverde?
It's a two-and-a-half hour ride on a dirt road, but is also accessible via shuttles from most of the major hotels.
Look at you riffing.
You're like the Miles Davis of small talk.
You're killing it.
So, Neal, tell us, what's it like, uh, growing up in Dearborn, Michigan?
- Well...
- I understand it was founded in 1786 and incorporated as a city in... scroll... 1929.
- Did you just say "scroll"?
- What?
No.
Scroll?
Hello?
(laughs)
I said "stroll."
As in, the residents of Dearborn, Michigan stroll through... reload page...

You're wearing SmartSpecs!
What are you talking about?

Topic changers.
Give me those!
Give it to me.
Wait just a second.
Wait just a second.
You're cheating!
You're on Wikipedia!
And this page is not even verified!
I told you I'm not comfortable socializing in front of strangers.
Forgive me.
- Uh-oh.
- What?
What is it?
- Nothing, nothing.
- No, no, don't tell me "nothing."
No, don't...
Don't!
Give it to me Give it to me.
- Okay, it's an Instagram alert.
- Mm-hmm.
Timothy, how could you?
- Who's Timothy?
- My ex.
He posted a picture of our beagle,
Dr. Katherine Salazar Lewis Ruffington.
He took my last name out of the middle name of our dog.
Maybe Instagram has a character limit.
- No, that's Twitter.
- Shut up, Neal.
Doesn't mean anything, Gordon.
It means everything.
He's given up on us.
Doesn't mean you have to give up.
- It's done, Simon.
- No, no!
You don't know that, Gordon!
Come on now.
Now is not the time to throw in the tow.
Take a risk, show him how much you love him.
Win him back!
Oh, so you're the relationship expert now.
What are you, 0 for 5 in the marriages?
Six if you count my Moonie wedding.
But at least I tried.
And tried and tried.
And what have we learned?
That love doesn't last.
It dies.
No exceptions.
Except for you two.
Have a great time in Costa Rica, where... click link...
"some of the world's best tarpon fishing could be found on the Peñas Blancas."
I don't know what that means.
(speaks indistinctly)
Hey, guys, you remember Jean.
Just had another lunch.
Jean just made me another vest.
It's a jean vest!
Like me, I'm Jean.
You get it?
I'll meet you at the elevators to carpool home.
That was our fourth lunch.
I returned the keys three days ago.
Guess what that means.
Lesson is learned.
Don't be nice, help no one.
I do not accept that.
You're not that guy.
I need you to be Andrew the Good.
We gotta find a way out of this Jean situation.
Well, all a tick needs is a good blood meal.
Maybe we just find her a new host.
SYDNEY:
These crutches are starting to hurt my shoulder.
Oh, no, you don't think it's the beginning of a mild rotator cuff injury, do you?
MAN:
I hope not.
So, you created this menu yourself?
Mm-hmm.
This is wonderful!
- Thank you.
- "First course, a seven-course French meal."
It's just a little confusing, but I love it.
(chuckles)
"Second course, romance.
Third course, a magical ending"
Well, I wonder what that could be.
- Simon?
- Hmm?
Where are you?
You're really different tonight.
Is there something wrong?
Only that romance dies and love is a crock.
I'm having the fish.
How about you?
What happened to the guy who said that he wanted to sleep in late so he could have more dirty dreams about me?
He woke up.
Wow.
I, uh, I thought this was actually going somewhere.
Let me tell you where this is going.
We go out a couple more times,
We start throwing the L-word around, we get married.
One morning I forget to take out the garbage, and suddenly you try to kill me with a kitchen knife.
So why don't we cut to the part where I say,
"Check please" and we spare each other years of misery?
Did someone order some magic?
You're early, Copperfield, and you're supposed to say "abracadabra."
- No one says that.
- Please tell me you're here to transform this horrible date into a good one.
This must be very embarrassing for you.
It sure is.
I'm leaving you now, Simon.
That's what they all say.
Wow, he's good.
(phone rings)
(ringing continues, Sydney grunts)
Hello?
Sydney, is that you?
- Dad?
- Mm-hmm.
Where have you been all day?
I was too despondent to come into work.
I'm sorry.
I thought I was calling Lauren's glasses.
I need her to bring my leather cap.
I'm doing Bearaoke with Timothy and I feel like an idiot without it.
Wait... you're doing Bearaoke?
No, I'm just gonna get a sandwich.
I'm talking to my dad.
Yeah, I called you.
- Huh?
- What?
No.
Why are you despondent?
Well, yeah, it's this whole thing with Timothy and...
No, Gordon, I'm talking to my dad on the glasses.
He's despondent?
- Yes.
- Simon?
Simon, what's... what's wrong?
!
Okay, you know, why don't I give you the glasses and then you guys can just talk directly?
No!
He killed love!
Do not put me on that man's face!
- What?
- He doesn't want to talk to you.
- You killed love.
- Oh, that's crazy.
- Here, give me...
- No, stop!
Listen, Simon, what are you talking about, I killed...?
What happened?
I ended it with Lily.
What's the point?
Wh-wh-why?
You were so into her.
It doesn't matter.
Any relationship I've ever had, I believed it was "the one,"
because I knew what Gordon and Timothy had was possible.
If they can't make it, what chance do any of us have?
- Dad, that's...
- What is he saying?
GORDON:
Listen to me.
Let me see those.
- Dad?
- Let me see 'em.
- No, he hung up.
- Where is he?
I don't-I don't know.
He-he broke things off with Lily.
I can't believe it.
- Because of me?
- Yes.
That's horrible.
Okay, you can get out of my face now.
Oh, no.
Look at her.
So defenseless.
I got this door!
(grunts)
Good-bye, sweet Jean.
I don't know why I kissed them.
Very unsanitary.
Oh, wait.
Someone left their keys here.
Did anyone see my keys?
Sydney Roberts, you dear!
Thank you.
I am taking you to lunch, young lady!
Oh!
Like the weakest little antelope.
We had to sacrifice one for the good of the pack.
- She'll look adorable in a jean skirt.
- Hey, Syd, if you're not doing anything this weekend...
I have plans.
For the next 48 weekends, I'm booked.
Oh, of course.
You're probably in physical therapy for your ankle.
Oh, actually, they said I didn't need it.
They don't know anything.
That is a moderate sprain if I've ever seen one.
You know, that's what I said!
Yeah.
What do you know about rotator cuff injuries?
They need to be taken seriously.

Something equally at home on a midnight stroll or during the horizontal mambo.
On the Fertile Crescent.
- Or doing the Bone Dance.
- Oh.

Oh, I hope those are your keys.
(laughter)
Why was I born?
Ow
Here
Instead of going out you can look at this...
Why here...
Daddy...?
Cut this crap!
He's a monster!
Throw the monster out and go back to just us
Say you'll come back
Please...
I'm begging you
Say it!
Say it!
Say it!
Say it!
Forget the brat and come back home
Hey!
Get up!
Daddy...
Don't...
I'm sorry
I can't do this
Why did my mother give birth to a monster like me?
Why am I here?
I didn't understand
==20 years later==
Thank you for banking with us
Boss, boss!
Boss, the customers' money...
There's only one thing I understand
A monster can only live in a world without people
Big prizes...
Buy this!
Buy it, buy it!
Even if I do, you won't play with it
We will!
Buy it!
Want me to feed you?
Okay
Ahhh...
Nice to meet you
What are your names?
Those are beautiful names
My name is...
Here we go
Ok, Shuichi, I'll open it up
Ah, hold on, okay
Ah...amazing
You're kidding me!
Hey, Jun!
Get to work
Such a temptation
After work, Shuichi will make you sweat
What?
Really?
Look, now he's working
Hey, Akira!
Could you call me an ambulance?
My heart...
Only rare cards!
My heart can't take it!
But how could it be...
Is he a god?
What is this...
I despair to learn that my level of mania has been matched in this world
Still no ambulance?
Akira
Yes
I've got it...
Hey, Shuichi, what about sweating?
Where can we go?
You promised, right?
Yeah, yeah, got it I promise
So, next time, huh?
Ah, a spa How about a spa?
What?
What's up?
Hey, Akira?
Jun?
What is it?
Next time where?
I promise that next time we'll go to a spa
Shuichi!
No worries
He's dead
The doctor said that it's a miracle you're alive and your recovery is amazing
Long ago, my grandpa told me men face three crises in life
Although I'm gay...
Three?
Were you really sick as a kid?
My whole life, I've never even had a cold
Hospitalized?
Yes, a car accident...
So this is your second crisis
That's good
Cause after the third one, it's all over
Third?
Akira, you do it
Umm, you were let go
I was fired!
?
It seems the company was planning to downsize
Your accident just gave them an excuse
But...we stuck up for you
But our company is just the worst
You're kidding...
But my grandpa also used to say
"Misfortune leads to happiness"
==Managing Director== ==Shigeru Kumoi==
Who?
The man who hit you is a company president!
Plus the address is a high rent district!
How much do you think the settlement will be?
This... is high rent?
Guitar repair
Yes?
Welcome!
We specialize in used guitars and repairs...
No way...
What is it?
It can't be!
I'm so very sorry!
I heard it would be 4-5 months for a full recovery
It's hard to believe you were released after only 3 days
I've always recovered quickly
That's really great
You're here for settlement money, right?
Yes
Would it be ok to pay in installments?
Installments?
Please
Please take it
What're you thinking!
?
This is yours...
It's just retirement savings
Do you know what I'm saving this for?
I know it's for my book
For publication, to publish your book
The other day, no, today too, my father is very sorry
So with this, please forgive us
The savings were to help Kanae achieve her dream of publishing her book
But I couldn't just take it from them Attack!
Card
What?
!
So instead of the money they offered me a job at their shop
Here we go...
Oh...okay
Dad
He's like a gift from heaven
Package for you
Sign here, please
Okay
Thank you
Map Maniac?
Uh, well...
I'll get that
Sorry
Where does it go?
- The dining room
- Okay
Over here
Whoa!
This is an out-of-print map of Gaia!
Sorry
Do you know this one?
Look at that...
Japan and Australia
Japan and Australia aren't this size
Together the length of their coastline is about twice that as America and China
"The Woman that Wanted to Marry a Map" by Kanae Kumoi
Please read it and tell me what you think
Okay
Why are you alive?
Dead?
Yes, in a car accident when I was 9 years old
My parents and little brother...
The two of us were sitting in the back seat, but
I was the only one that made it...
Basically, your life is defined by the responsibility you feel for your brother
No, nothing as great as that
Then how do you define your life?
Just living until you die
Sorry for talking about such things at dinner
I think I'll have seconds
What Shuichi said was amazing
Life really is just living til you're dead
I've got to get going
Hold on, Shuichi
Okay
What's this?
We were robbed once before
I'm opening the door
Well?
They're having some sort of festival there
Look, this is obscene, right?
It's fine, let me introduce you
What?
Again?
That's enough What're you guys doing?
Where are they having the festival?
Did you already eat?
You already ate
Shuichi
Yes?
Your friends?
Nice to meet you
Akira and Jun
I'm Jun
Good evening
It's good
Welcome...
No, that's okay
How much was she going to give you?
Cut it out...
But
Have some cake
Thank you
Explain it to me slowly
Go ahead
But I need help
She's crazy
Dad...
Dad, here you go
No, she's amazing
She's living true to herself
Happy Birthday!
- Go ahead
- Thanks
Me too, I'm living the best I can
When did you start taking her side?
Don't move, don't move, don't move
Don't move
Who are you?
Kanae!
What did you do?
What'd you do to them?
What're you doing?
Let go!
Akira!
Jun!
What are you?
Put them back the way they were!
Mr. Kumoi, Mr. Kumoi!
Dad!
Shuichi!
Doctor, blood pressure is dropping
Put him in 8 and start the IV
Prepare for blood transfusion!
Mr. Kumoi died from the shock caused by massive blood loss
Dad...
Controlled?
Yes
A strange man came and controlled Mr. Kumoi and he jumped by himself
Yes, everyone was being controlled
You, too?
No...
I was the only one that wasn't
Why is that?
I have no idea
Mr. Kumoi definitely jumped by himself?
Yes, by himself...
But if he was controlled, it's murder
Detective Shibamoto, please believe me
When you calm down, let's grab something to eat
My wife wants to see you, too
Report on the scene
One survivor, a boy
Other 3 family members killed instantly
Roger
You were with your brother?
You hungry?
You can come to my house
My wife makes a delicious steak
It's my fault
My brother's the weak one
I promised I'd protect him
Protect him...
I promised
Because I'm the strong one
But...
I'm sorry
I promised...
I didn't protect you
I'm sorry
It's not your fault
You didn't do it
Shuichi, you didn't go under, did you?
No
Why...
Why didn't you stop my dad?
I'm sorry
It's not your fault...
No
Sorry...
I couldn't save someone again
Look
Kanae!
What did you do?
What'd you do to them?
What're you doing?
Let go!
Akira!
Jun!
What's this?
You don't remember?
Akira?
Kanae either
The police will definitely believe you with this
What are you?
If the police see this, they'll arrest her
Can you edit this out?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Why can't I control you?
Why don't you do what I want?
Get out of here!
He's coming, get out!
"He"?
That guy!
I said get out
Wh...where?
Just hide anywhere!
I said hurry!
No way!
?
Hurry and hide
I'm scared!
Aren't you scared?
Wait Jun
Hey, Jun
There!
Copy that
Hurry up!
Hold on, grab my hand
No way, if you fall, you'll take me down, too
That's cold!
You, too, Shuichi!
Ow!
Hey!
You can only control who you see?
So you can't if you're blind
You monster!
You killed Mr. Kumoi, so even if I die, I won't forgive you
I can't have someone that won't do what I want
Get out of my world
Hello, Shuichi can you hear me?
Did something happen?
Explain it
Shibamoto!
I saw the video
I wasn't lying, was I?
It's not really that...
Is Detective Shibamoto here yet?
Instead...
I'm taking an interest in you
What did you do?
What'd you do to them?
Please...help me
His request was odd, wasn't it?
"Don't let him deceive you"
My...
If you just look in my eyes, you'll understand I'm not lying
I know what I've said is strange but it's all true
I believe you Can you make a written statement?
Yes
Are you scared to pull the trigger
Then why did you kill Mr. Kumoi?
That wasn't the first time I killed
Afraid because you can't control me?
What's going on?
He can't do it in the dark either?
Hey, let me out of these
Hurry and let me out!
Are you going to kill everyone here?
Shut up, you're the bad guy here
Why won't you do what I want?
What are you!
I'm Shuichi Tanaka
More bodies will keep coming?
Gone!
Gone, gone!
Ko-chan's gone!
No...
Ko-chan, Ko-chan!
Shuichi Tanaka
You...
It would've been better if you never knew me
If no one had noticed, you'd still be alive
No one can get in my way
Live until you die
That's my life
Regarding the detectives' firing of their weapons
My orders are to not disclose this
Don't release the video
Yes, sir
Detective Shibamoto, you get it, right?
Yes, that's why I need your assistance
You are an expert in Cultural Anthropology and Genetic Engineering
So what is your professional opinion?
I hate people that can't reconcile their beliefs with what they see, that's discrimination
Have you heard about mankind's defense instinct?
A defense instinct against mutants
You're saying those two are evolved humans?
It seems so
A man with an unbelievable ability and the only man he can't access
Having people with those kinds of power appearing at the same time
You're saying that to us, their meeting is extremely dangerous?
Early this morning, the Shinjuku police stated that two armed men appeared in the station and fired shots
The main suspect, Tanaka, and his accomplice, a man in his 30s are wanted for questioning in relation to this incident at the Shinjuku West Station
According to local police, the two armed men appeared at the West Shinjuku Station, fired their weapons and fled
The Shinjuku police have released this CCTV image of the two suspects and are asking for information
A number of stations in the Shinjuku area are receiving eyewitness reports of the suspect Shuichi Tanaka
He does not appear to be acting with the unidentified accomplice
Don't move!
Hands up!
Get him
Making an arrest without warrant at 2113 hours
Do you know my name?
I am a human with a name
I'm a human
I'm not a monster
How are you?
What was that?
Well...
It's like I thought, Shuichi is definitely not coming
But he promised
Oh well, can't help it
Jun, you don't look too happy
- Shuichi!
- It's Shuichi!
Are you ok?
Did you go to the hospital?
I'm ok
What?
You're almost all healed up from where Kanae stabbed you?
I've always been a fast healer
I think that I'm the only one that can stop him
By "him" you mean that guy?
I think that's why I was born
How could you say anything about a body like this?
He's susceptible to light, and sound, too
Anyway, it's best if we take his sight
Could you two help me?
By "help", you mean...
I want you to help me stop him
But look, when I was hiding, I scraped it
But if I soak in the onsen, I'll be fine
Me...me, too Right here
But I'll try my best
I couldn't expect any less from my friends
Hand, your hand!
This is hard
Eat my 44 Magnum
Where's Shuichi?
==I think you guys might get in the way== ==I'll fight alone==
You're from Utopia, right?
I'm sorry, we're temporarily closed
The criminal... is my... son
This is my son
My son killed him
Shuichi
When did you get here?
Ummm...
Just now
I heard "he killed your father"
She said she wanted to contact you when you came back
Shuichi?
Police!
Don't move!
You sold out your son?
I don't know you
I've come back here so many times
I wanted to kill you
Why did you give birth to me?
To kill people?
Back then
even you thought it would be better if I was dead?
I'm sorry
I...
I...
I'm sorry
Forgive me
Please forgive me
I'm sorry
I don't remember, why...
Kanae, you didn't do anything
I'm the one who let him die
I couldn't protect him
It's my fault
I swear
I will protect you, Kanae
Hello, this is Shuichi Tanaka from Utopia speaking
You just came by...
Why aren't you dead?
Why are you alive?
Because of you
Why are you alive?
I told you...
I'm just living until I die
That's why you ran away?
I get it now
I think that I existly solely to stop you
So you should think about the purpose of your life
Coming...
Is Shuichi here?
I don't know that guy's whereabouts
His mother came here, right?
- Yes
- What did she say?
Um, well...
We found her body
It appears to be suicide
Everyone connected to him is dying one after the other
Shuichi's in danger
Ah, put it down over there
This one's really heavy...
You know Shuichi, right?
Did he go to meet that guy?
Huh?
!
Could be...
You didn't want to help him?
He said he didn't want us to get in the way
This isn't normal for him, not like Shuichi at all
We've got a report of the two of them headed towards Ueno
I just got a report that they are headed towards Ueno
I'm going to help Shuichi
When he was asked about "life", Shuichi answered it was just living til you're dead
Shuichi has a monster-like power to heal
Monster?
Even an injury or illness that would take a normal person 100 days to recover from
Shuichi is fine in a single day
So he can't even imagine when he will die
That's what he meant when he answered "just living til you're dead"
"Stop me?"
"Are you crazy?"
"How will you stop me?"
"What can you do?"
I hope you understand this is useless
"I hope you understand this is useless"
"You're making the situation worse"
Quit it!
You promised to meet me in person!
Where are you?
Come out!
All the people here...
"don't know what will happen"
They won't even remember it
"It'll be all your fault"
"They will all suffer because of you"
"If you weren't here, no one would suffer"
And I wouldn't have suffered
"Everything is your fault"
"You killed that man, too"
I know that
"And even now, because of you, the deaths continue"
Stop it!
Who's evil?
"Me, who said not to come, or you, who keeps following me?"
Who will win?
All of us
"or just you?"
Why are you doing this?
What's your goal, mutant?
Do you just want to destroy all non-mutants?
So you can create evolution
Who?
I recognize there are abnormal people like you in the world
But those of us of the old world will resist you til the end
Sorry, but I can't allow your new world to exist
Who are you?
!
Shuichi Tanaka is abnormal, too
Will you kill him?
I've been waiting for this
You guys should never have been born
This will be the last thing you hear
Why did no one know about the power you have until now?
How have you been living?
Since you aren't answering, I guess I'll have to kill you
Please...please stop
You guys should never have been born
Are you ok?
They fell!
They're dead!
Honey!
Call an ambulance!
I'm think I'll kill you
I met your mother
My son
killed him
I'm sorry
I... should have killed my son
She said that if I saw you
I should kill you She asked me to kill you
But that's not why I'm doing this
You killed my father So I can't forgive you
So what?
And then you killed your own mother
You made it look like suicide and you killed her
I didn't kill her I couldn't kill her
I couldn't kill her!
Stop it!
This is the end!
You're body can't take much more
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Just die already
Don't move!
Down on the ground!
Shields, forward!
Let Kanae go!
Kanae!
You're Kanae?
Get ready, the monster's nearby
No
Find the monster!
I'm not a monster
My name is not "monster"
Where's Kanae?
Let Kanae go, you monster!
Shut up
You're the monster, Shuichi Tanaka
You just never knew
That's not true
I, too, am a monster
But I didn't save my brother
I didn't want to be different from other people
I always deceived myself
So I couldn't protect anyone
No one needs to die
You need to stop
These are humans
No matter what, they are weak
So I kill them
Don't...no one needs to die
No one
I'm begging you, please stop
In the end, you can't help her
Because of you
I'll kill her
Give it back
Shuichi Tanaka
You have one, too, don't you?
A name...
No one needs to die
Not even you
Let go, or you'll die too
Let go
Shuichi, Shuichi!
Don't die
Why don't you do what I want?
You...should have never met me
But I'm... glad I met you
I wanted someone, anyone to know me, to know my name
Shuichi Tanaka
My first...
Shuichi Tanaka?
He... protected you...
You'll buy one...
Thank you very much
Thanks, thanks a lot
Ah, you wanted a bookmark?
Which one do you prefer?
Australia
Thank you very much
That's 1260 Yen
Live until you die...

When our descendants ask us in the future what our generation bad done for them and what we had achieved for our country, let us proudly answer them, without any hesitation that we labored again and again with faith in the modernization of our country.
Man... what the fuck.
He's not picking up?
Nope.
That fucking bastard.
He's pulling out.
What do we do?
What else can we do?
We should break in.
But the door's locked.
Shit.
- Hey, you have the key?
- How would I have the key?
- OK.
Try calling him again.
- Alright...
The fucker must be inside there somewhere!
Is it locked?
Sir.
Don't get anything from here.
The owner's a greedy one, he doesn't even pay us.
Hello?
Hey, sorry but I don't think I'll make it.
I'm still in training.
I said I can't today.
My co-worker's coming.
Sorry.
- Did anyone stop by?
- Nope.
Thank God.
The bus stopped on my way, so I came running here.
I'm not the late type, but it's easy to be late around here.
- It's okay right?
- Yeah, it's okay.
You came early?
No, I just came on time.
Are you from around here?
No.
Then how did you find this work?
A friend who used to work here introduced me.
Sounds good.
We don't get too many people here.
There's nothing hard about the work, really.
Just get to work on time, that's all.
Hey... don't tell the boss that I was late today.
Just between us.
But you're gonna quit anyways.
It's always good to leave on a clean note.
Hey, can you teach me how to balance the accounts?
- I didn't teach you that already?
- Nope.
- Welcome.
- Welcome.
Press this button to check the prices when you're balancing the accounts.
I wish all this money were mine.
- You like money?
- Who doesn't?
You don't?
Yeah, I do.
If a customer checks out, then you press this button to calculate.
- Try it.
- Yeah.
That'll be 5,000 won.
- Hey.
- Yes?
No.
I'm talking about you, lady.
Me?
Who do you think I am?
Why are you using me to explain things to him?
Is this how you work?
Where's the owner?
- Tell him to come out!
- What?
You're the owner?
We're really sorry.
You think getting paid's a joke?
Let's get something straight, alright?
It's all about keeping it real in this world.
You got that?
We're really sorry.
Good-bye.
What was that about?
What do you mean.
- What did you apologize for?
- Sorry?
Do you always say sorry that easily?
I'm sorry.
- For what again?
- For saying sorry.
Hey...
I'm going out smoking.
I'll be back.
Alright.
Why don't you pick up your phone?
I told you not to call again.
Can't we just meet and talk over this?
How many times do I have to tell you, it's over!
I'm so sick of it.
You, and this place...
Hana...
I should've never come here in the first place.
Don't call me ever again.
Are you done yet?
Look.
Do you like it?
Hey, you look really pretty.
Hana, you look prettier.
No really.
You're much, much prettier.
Really.
You're the prettiest of all the girls I've seen.
There's something on your face...
Okay, okay.
Just for a little bit, okay?
I didn't know you were that angry.
I'm really sorry.
Hey.
I'm kind of curious.
Why are you so polite to me?
I feel a bit uneasy.
What, being with me?
No, no.
Just letting my guards off.
You don't feel uneasy around me?
- No, you're easy to be around with.
- Me?
Just talking like this, you know.
I'm famished from all the crying.
Do you have a girlfriend?
I shouldn't like someone right now.
Why not?
I'm beginning my military service soon.
How much time do you have left?
3 months.
That's no reason to not like somebody.
Feelings don't work that way.
I have to make someone wait for me.
I don't like that, you know, being irresponsible.
So you must've thought I was irresponsible when I kept you waiting just before.
21 minutes is different from 21 months.
How are those different?
What do you think you'll be doing in 21 minutes?
Who knows.
Maybe here... what about after 21 months?
I'm not sure.
Why?
Wheter it's 21 minutes or 21 months, nobody knows what's gonna happen.
- Don't you think so?
- Yeah...
I think it's the same with relationships.
Nobody knows what it'll be like in 10 years, in 1 year, or 1 minute, you know.
Don't you think?
But the moment you're in love, it all feels true, so there's no room for regret when it ends.
For me, I'm always going to begin with a clean slate no matter how many times I break up.
Another customer.
You think you can do it on your own?
Yeah.
Then I'll go to the storage and get the stock list.
What were you talking about with that girl?
Nothing much, really.
How was the audition?
'Maybe next time.'
You know there's not going to be a 'next time'...
There's auditions everywhere.
Nobody knows what it'll be like in 1 year or 10 years...
You'll get it some day if you start out with a clean slate every time.
I've faith in you.
Thanks anyway.
Hyunsoo, did you mean what you said?
What do you mean?
That you'll wait for me.
I can bear 21 months.
It's nothing to me.
You're not meeting with someone else, are you?
Hyunsoo, I love you.
I wish time could stand still right now.
Hey, don't check out other guys while you're there.
I'm trusting you on this.
Excuse me, I won 500 won on these.
OK... here it is.
Thank you.
The party you're trying to call is not available.
Press 1 if you'd like to leave a voice mail.
Hi, Mr. Chun.
I need to leave early today for an important appointment, but the next shift isn't here yet.
Could you please give me a call when you can?
- Yes, Mr. Chun.
- You called me?
Mr. Chun, I need to leave early for today's audition.
There's no one else there, so what do you mean you need to leave.
But the thing is...
If you leave now, you won't get your pay.
- That's that.
- Hello?
Mr. Chun?
- Excuse me!
- Yes?
I won 1,000 won with this.
Would you like it in cash?
No.
I'll just get 2 lottery tickets with it, please.
- Alright... here you are.
- Thank you.
In Jesus' name we prayed, Amen.
Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name...
- Hello?
- Where are you, Mr. Lee?
I'm on my way there now.
The traffic's a bit rough.
Your turn's coming up soon.
I'll be right there as soon as I cross this light.
Please come here as soon as you can.
I'm sorry but could you audition other people first?
That's going to be difficult...
- OK.
I'll be right there.
- Please hurry up.
Namu amitabul gwanseum bosal...
Ha, you ain't got no money?
Then fuck off.
That's the rule here.
You think I don't know this town?
Money rules here, so why'd I work for you if you ain't got no money?
That'll be 1,200 won.
Excuse me?
Excuse me!
Yes?
It's 1,200 won.
You gave me 1,000.
I'll come back again later.
Ha, you ain't got no money?
Then fuck off.
That's the rule here.
You think I don't know this town?
Money rules here, so why'd I work for you if you ain't got no money?
Fucking asshole.
If you ain't got no money, then fuck off.
Get the fuck off!
Excuse me.
Again?
Aren't you being a little rude?
I'm a customer, you know!
I was just practicing for my audition.
So you won the lottery again?
No, it's a miss.
Just give me a new one, please.
Here it is.
- Hello?
- Are you coming, Mr. Lee?
Yes, I just got off the bus.
I'll be right there.
- Your turn is coming up very soon.
- I'm sorry.
I'm almost there.
Shit.
Excuse me, I'll have another lottery ticket.
I'm sorry, sir.
But we're all out.
What?
But there was some here a while ago...
Excuse me, do you have a religion by the way?
No, I don't.
Then... throw these away for me, please.
- Hello there, sonny.
- Oh, hi.
- Lee Hyeon-su?
- Yes, yes.
I'm here to give you some good words.
I'm sorry but if you're not going to buy anything, I need to leave now...
- Do you believe in Jesus?
- I do!
I believe in Jesus.
Must be another Jesus.
Believe in our Jesus and go to heaven, sonny.
- Let me pray for you.
- Excuse me...
Our Lord and Savior, we pray for Lee Hyeon-su.
Hyeon-su's working very, very hard in this store even on a hot day.
Pour down your grace upon Hyeon-su, our Lord and Savior...
One, please.
'The One' cigarette?
Which one?
- One.
- You mean 1 mm?
- Esse.
- Esse cigarette?
Which one do you want?
ONE, ESSE.
Either existence or one.
It's a difficult question.
Excuse me?
Do you know the Latin root for Esse?
Sir, if you're not going to buy anything, I need to get going.
To exist.
Esse One comes to exist as a being.
And by existence here, it refers to the fundamental One.
So would you like The One?
The ancient philosopher Parmenides said, "Existence is One.
What exists, exists;
what doesn't, doesn't."
Because thinking exists, and nothingness does not.
If a burger rots, is it not a burger anymore?
Does it rot because it's a burger?
Or is it a burger because it rots?
The world of senses is in this producing, changing world we exist.
In other words, the existence, the essence, the nature of a burger...
Idea is one.
If the existence is all one, what are humans trying to become one with?
It's the One, the Absolute.
People's desires to identify themselves with the One can be found everywhere.
Because people think manifestation of existence relies on the religion.
But... is salvation possible?
Sir, what is it that you want?
To want?
What?
What do I exist for?
Raison d'etre?
Raison!
You want 'Raison,' the cigarette?
There's something called the principle of sufficient reason.
Everything exists for a reason.
You, me, and all of us exist for a reason.
So please.
Don't ever be sorry that you were born.
We all have the reason for existence But the problem is our reason.
Because of our reason we put ourselves in agony.
It's because we separated a priori from the experience of the body and thus came to think we internally have the pure rational concept as a universal form of experience.
Ergo raison d'etre.
So do you want blue or black?
Neoplatonist Plotinus believed that there's another world beyond the reason and that we can return to the absolute, or become One through that world.
But reason must admit infinity, so truth is in essential, abominable.
Look.
In the end, the truth id ugly.
"Art exists for humans to not perish by reason."
That's what Nietzsche said.
Nietzsche.
If Nietzsche came by to buy cigarettes, he would've said,
One Marlboro, please.
Red or light?
Do you know the Latin root of the word 'red'?
- It's 2,700 won?
- Yes, it is.
Wait, I've too many coins here...
If you ain't got no money, then fuck off!
Don't ever be sorry you were born.
It was a pleasure.
Hello?
I'm coming up right now!
No, you don't have to.
You're kidding me.
Please, I prepped so much for this.
So just give me one more shot.
We've given you as much as we can.
I'm afraid you're not fit for us.
Right...
Don't you think that being on time is pretty basic?
I'm very sorry.
I guess I'll try out next time...
We've already given you a chance.
You must've prepared a lot, but I'm afraid I can't do anything for you at this point.
Don't let this disappoint you.
There are a lot of...
Hey.
You got Vita 1000?
(In North Korean accent) We only have Kwangdong 500.
Shit.
Heard Kwangdong's CEO Choi Soo-boo croaked.
Money don't give shit when you croak!
Steve Jobs fucking croaked from pancreatic cancer.
And Samsung's CEO Lee Kun-hee's a skinny ass...
Go ahead.
(with a North Korean accent) Eh... you drink this too over there?
That'll be 1,650 won.
You can keep the change.
What's your name and number?
You need to pay 10 more won.
Is that so?
Then put it on my tab!
Or tell that guy Kim Jeong-eun to pay it back.
Fucking commies...
Go ahead.
It'll be 5,010 won.
You know what this is?
You don't?
(Banana-flavored condom)
(Banana-flavored condom) Want this big daddy to teach you how to use this thing?
Want this big daddy to teach you how to use this thing?
Are you harassing me right now?
Oh, you even know what 'harassing' means?
You're getting it all wrong.
I'm just worried.
Abortion's illegal here, first of all.
If you don't want to use it with me, then... you can use it with your boyfriend.
So how many times you think you can do it?
Big daddy here's hella good.
I'm good, for real.
Real fucking good!
What do you think, want to have a go with this banana flavor?
If you're not doing it, then why ask?
You all talk big!
It's none of my business.
Oh, fine.
It's none of my business either!
Shit.
Oh no, what do we do!
There's no time for you to sit around like this!
This is big!
Man, I really wasn't gonna come... what is it?
It's a war!
Your country's firing a nuclear missile.
Those fucking commies, gone insane from not fighting!
They're all coming down here and it's gonna be war!
No time to sit around here...
By the way... what are you doing in front of a customer?
You're not gonna welcome me?
Welcome!
Your country, what's wrong with those commies?
Huh?
Peaceful reunification?
What peaceful reunification!
It's all the commies' fantasy.
If those commies come down here we'll be wiped out completely!
Only innocent people like me get killed for no reason!
And women first, they'll get raped on the streets, you know.
Without condoms, never.
Kids, what about kids?
!
- One Lamborghini, please.
- Oh.
Right.
Look.
I was here first.
Where's the restroom?
It's right inside the door.
OK, I'll pay a moment later.
Is she fucking drugged up or something?
What's wrong with her?
Cutting in front of me and shit!
You get many customers like that?
Anyways, which side will you take if we get in a war?
What if I said North Korea?
Look at you, look at you.
This is why...
Once a commie, always a commie!
My father used to say, why we have to feed you commies with our tax money?
I'm a South Korean who pay taxes like everyone else here.
You lucky you.
If the North wins you'll be a commie, if the South wins you'll fucking sit there and paint your nail polish.
- What you think?
- I'm not thinking.
No... about me.
What you think about me?
Sounds silly?
Are you laughing at me or what?
You got money?
Why the money talk right now?
If you don't, fuck off.
That's the rule I learned here.
Don't mess around with me if you're not buying anything.
Greedy pig.
Is money that important to you?
You think I don't know this place?
Money rules here.
Why'd I work for you if you don't have any money?
Fucking weirdo...
Look.
I do have money.
Here, I'm getting a pack of gum.
OK?
Now I'm a customer, yeah?
The pack of gum's 700 won, so that'd be a total of 37,710 won, including the tab.
Sir.
37, 7...
I'll get you that.
I do have it at home.
Just wait, I'll be back.
You can't just leave.
I'm not, my credit card's on hold.
I said I'll come back and get you the money.
There's no tab for people with bad credit.
You shithead.
So what if I have bad credit?
What have you done for me?
Cunt doesn't know shit and keeps yacking away!
You're the one stealing without paying, so don't get pissed at me!
You fucking pro-North Korean commie bitch.
I'm... not a North Korean anymore.
Fuck you.
All you dirty whores got sold to China when you came down during the war.
Dirty, fucking cunt!
You... you filthy South Korean beggar, think you can say anything to me?
I called the cops, so get out.
Get out!
You don't understand...
Get out!
I'm sorry.
Crazy bastard...
Get out!
Yo!
Ya kno what time it eez, huh?
Check it out!
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!
Baby!
Have we met before?
What?
No, I don't think so.
I think so.
Try to remember.
Where have we met?
At your home.
Don't you remember?
I actually have a bad memory...
Actually, I'm still there.
Where's there?
Your place.
Oh, man!
God, you scared me!
Thought it was that time I got hung over.
Please keep this here.
Sorry, but we don't keep things here.
Someone's going to pick it up soon...
It's really important.
Don't give it to just anybody.
Make sure you give it to someone who doesn't buy anything here.
Promise me?
What, that's the bathroom key.
Have we met before?
Try to remember.
Welcome.
Did someone leave anything here?
Make sure to give it to someone who doesn't buy anything.
- Are you...
- Yes.
Make sure you give it to someone who doesn't buy anything here.
Do you know what it is?
Well, it's nothing important.
I'm sorry, there's nothing like that here.
Oh, these are all delivered boxes.
Nobody left anything.
There's nothing for you here!
Alright.
I guess I was mistaken.
Have you seen this girl?
Is she a North Korean spy?
I don't know.
She's a dangerous woman, so if you see her call 010- 487...
You dumbshit, are you here to advertise our number?
Call 911.
Shit, that son of a bitch cop.
Fussing about spies of all things... welcome.
Make sure you give it to someone who doesn't buy anything here.
Fucking box!
You're back...
Man...
Could you please eat after you pay.
Never gonna end up like her, not me...
Ma'am!
How'd you get in here?
Please go out.
Do you have any recyclable things I can take?
The old man came yesterday and took it all.
Really... wait!
Ma'am, please take this.
Why this all of a sudden?
Is nothing in here?
I'm clueless.
It's pretty heavy though.
I think it's too much for me.
I've been taking empty boxes only.
It's too much for me.
OK, bye.
- Hello?
- It's me.
Who?
Don't you remember?
- Who is this?
- It's me!
What the...
what happened?
It's a shame you remembered so late.
No, no.
I've been thinking about you.
You're going to pick up this box, right?
Actually...
I'm still there.
Where's there?
Right next to you!
Ha ha, what on earth are you talking about.
Here, here.
Hello?
Yes, did you find it?
This isn't a dream.
Don't touch me, you fucking perv.
What?
You fucker, who are you?
Now you're curious?
You!
Come out first, you fucking psycho!
You know... you're an asshole, and you have a big mouth.
Let's shut it up.
What the hell do you know...
Silence, at last.
Really nice.
Let's stay like this for just one minute.
It's no use.
Anyway, you'll have to go into the box.
My voice is back, you bitch!
You're fucking dead!
Goodbye!
What?
What is this?
What the hell!
Why's it so dark?
Hey!
Stop playing with me.
Let me out.
Let me out... what?
!
Where are you going!
Is no one there?
What the...
Is it locked?
It's locked?
- Is it locked?
- It's locked.
- Is it still locked?
- Yes, it's still locked.
Jeez, I'm starving...
Hey, where are you?
The store's closed.
OK, I'll be right there.
Where the hell is he?
Why the hell isn't he coming?
Maybe he went to the restroom?
- Is it locked?
- It's locked.
Are you the mother of Mr. Chun Doo-hwan who owns this store?
I'm in front of the store right now.
Aren't you open today?
I can't get in touch with him.
I'm off work soon, so please come quickly.
I'll tell you when you get here, so please hurry.
Hey, hey.
- What are you doing?
- Hi, Mr. Chun.
- Are you working or what?
- I'm working right now.
You call this working right now?
And why are you playing this so loud?
If I have my earphones on, I can't hear the customers coming in.
So you heard me come in just right now?
If you're here, don't pull this kind of thing.
Just work!
This isn't a prep school.
Shut that off right now!
In Japan, you put your cellphone and books in the locker and only work.
Understand?
Even part-timers are professional over there.
- Have you been to Japan?
- No.
Look at you, look at you.
That's why you can't get a job.
Yes, sir.
Please think of this as your job and be a little more proactive!
Yes, sir.
What's wrong with you.
Look how lucky you are.
You get paid every penny just killing time here.
I'm jealous of you, really jealous.
Don't laugh, buster!
You, open this box, clean up the store those boxes over there too.
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.
- And put that away.
I mean it.
- Yes, sir.
Welcome.
May, I, help you?
I hear, that...
In Afghanistan, just becoming a mother is, most dangerous things, for a woman.
In Afghanistan, just becoming a mother is, most dangerous things...
Don't talk to me.
Don't annoy me.
This is fucking racist.
OK?
Fucking racist!
Fucking?
We're not from Afghanistan.
Oh my god, your nose...
Are you okay?
Do I look the same?
Yes...
You are so beautiful.
Thanks.
How much?
Will you hurry up?
Hurry up!
How much?
OK, wait...
Um... 8 thousand, and 3 hundred won.
It's too bad.
I didn't got to play a flume ride.
Oh, honey.
You don't wanna wait that long line, do you?
Yes, I know.
Welcome.
Where are the drinks?
- Mommy, Guess what?
- Yes, honey.
What is it?
I've got a mail from Jessica.
She's in Paris right now!
She even went to Louvre yesterday.
Louvre... where are we going for our vacation?
Well, wherever you wanna go?
Louvre sounds good.
Let me talk to your dad about it, OK?
Yeah.
How about Africa?
Africa is too dangerous.
Mom, this is new!
Can I please try it?
Oh, honey.
You know is not good for you.
It's artificial Strawberry.
I know.
But just this one time, please...
All right.
Just this once.
Don't tell your dad.
Hi.
Where are you from?
May I help you?
I'll buy those.
OK...
That'll be 2,400 won.
Here you go.
Thanks, Mom.
You're the best!
I know.
Anything for my sweety my baby.
Let's go!
Excuse me... your receipt!
Welcome.
Candy.
Did you see that spy wanted list?
Yeah.
That girl with a scar on her face?
- Yeah.
But you know what's worse?
- What's that?
When I first came to Korea, I went to a convenience store to get some water.
The part-timer there had a big scar like that!
What?
So that spy woman was working there?
Dunno, but there aren't many people with big scars like that, you know.
True, I heard there's a lot of North Korean spies here.
- Huh?
- It's an interesting country.
Strawberry's out?
There's banana flavor!
How about banana flavor?
- I don't like banana flavor.
- I heard it tastes good...
- who did you use the banana flavor with?
- Candy, what's wrong with you?
Spill it, who did you use it with?
Don't you lie to me!
What's wrong with you, Candy...
Candy.
Never mind!
Go ahead and ask.
Excuse me, is there strawberry flavor?
- Strawberry flavor?
- Yes.
Strawberry flavor.
- Calm down, Candy...
- Don't touch me!
Of course!
Please wait, wait.
Hey.
Tell me now.
Who did you use it with!
Candy, let's stop this...
Foreigner like to strawberry candy.
What the hell is this?
That's not it!
You fucking retards!
Candy, calm down...
Strawberry candy... welcome to our store.
Um, I'm not a customer.
I came to find some part-time work.
You look pretty young.
Aren't you in high school?
No.
- How old are you?
- I'm eight-fuckin-teen.
- Say what?
- Oops!
I'm eighteen.
Show me your ID.
Here it is, sir.
Welcome.
You're a student, alright.
Nope, I'm not.
- You don't go to school?
- Nope.
How come you don't go to school?
And what was that about eight-fuckin-teen, to a grownup.
Eighteen!
That's how you say it properly.
Didn't you learn that in school?
I dropped out.
Sir, this is 'buy two, get one free'.
You can get another bottle.
Oh, that so?
- What do you do if you're not in school?
- I write.
You write?
Hey.
I'm telling you, kid.
School won't wait for you forever.
You should be studying in school at your age!
You can't earn money from writing!
Yes, I can.
Hey.
You know nothing about life right now.
And if you're looking for work, you should be polite, not grinning like that.
Would you hire yourself if you were in my position?
Stop laughing, kid!
Front of a grown-up like me...
You're not fit for us.
Go somewhere else.
- Fucking bastard.
- That little...
That rude son of a bitch.
That'll be 2,400 won.
- Please, take this.
- Thank you so much, sir!
You're so hard-working.
And you don't even hire part-time workers...
Can't trust kids these days, you know?
Irresponsible and greedy...
How's the business going?
It's alright.
The economy's really bad these days, you know.
I don't get any customers at all either.
You own the sashimi place, right?
Yes.
Please come to my place more often.
I'll give you a good service.
Yes.
Thank you very much.
- Have a good day.
- Same for you.
Hey.
We'll get through the hard times.
Cheers!
Cheers!
Shit... this is way too heavy...
- This one is not for sale?
- No.
Any trouble while I was away?
Not at all!
I've been here all along, so how can anything happen?
What the... it doesn't match.
- Hey.
- Yes, sir.
- Did you check the inventory for today?
- Yes, I did.
It doesn't match up, though.
It's not matching up.
What's going on here?
What's this?
Chips past their expiration date can be discarded, right?
No, snacks shouldn't be discarded.
Think how long this thing's expiration date is.
Oh...
I ate one because I thought otherwise...
- I'll pay for that.
- No, no, that's alright.
Just don't do it next time.
And you know, the inventory's not matching up these days.
So please check a bit more carefully.
This stuff is all money.
If it doesn't match up, I have to pay the head branch myself.
Yes, sir.
I understand.
Hey, mom.
Mija's mom asked me when you can pay her back...
I asked you to wait a bit.
That's what I'm telling her, but that woman's keep...
Mom, mom, mom.
Hang on, hang on.
I'll get my hands on money pretty soon.
Is your business going better?
How can it?
After the electricity bills, the rent, and paying these kids...
I get nothing for myself.
And the money I send to the head branch everyday... those bastards.
Then how are going to get the money?
I've something in mind.
Don't worry, just get some rest.
Don't use part-time workers.
I can help you out.
Mom, how can you work here.
At your age.
Customers don't like old people working here anyways.
Alright...
Mom, please get some rest.
Oh, Lord...
Sir!
What are you doing here?
- You're back!
- I wanted to see you again.
Actually...
I came to get more of those honey water bottles for my workers.
Sure.
Please bring them here.
So if I get these four it'd be 4,800 won, right?
Two for free.
Yes.
Wait, hold on.
Has this been being selling as 'buy two, get one free'?
Yes.
Is there any problem?
Didn't you check the date here?
It says until July.
If so, then why... the computer said it was still on sale.
How many times did I tell you, the head branch workers make mistakes so you need to be more careful!
We're sorry.
That'll be 7,200 won.
Wait, he told me it was 'buy two, get one free' just a while ago... and I got one free.
- You did?
- Yes.
No...
Sir, I apologize.
But it's no longer on sale.
So you have to pay 7,200 won.
That's none of my business.
If the sale policy's changed without an announcement to customers, it should be sold the way customers know it.
It's not like you've opened business recently.
I run business too.
This isn't how you should work.
OK.
I apologize, sir.
Just give it to him.
'Buy two, get one... '
Sir, please take these...
I'm not buying anymore!
Go drink these up yourself!
Are you kidding with me?
For a couple bucks.
Jesus.
Dammit.
Shit...
You think chips can be discarded?
You think?

Convenience stores don't even get off on holidays.
There's no day off at convenience stores.
Well, props to you for being here instead of hanging out with your boyfriend and friends on such a nice weather like this.
I'm not a kid anymore, you know.
I need to make my ends meet.
You're such a hardworking young lady.
May fortune smile on you.
It's for me?
Oh gosh, what did I just do!
I was supposed to give you this first, not that.
I'm losing my mind.
That'll be 1,400 won.
- Did I surprise you?
- No, it's alright.
Here's your change.
- You have toilet paper here?
- It's up there.
- Over there?
- Yes.
How much is it?
That'll be 15,600 won.
Why's it so expensive?
It's so much more expensive than where I live.
What are you doing?

- I guess I've no choice.
20,000 won received.
Would you like the receipt?
- Hurry up.
- Here's 4,400 won, your change.
- Where's my receipt?
- You just said you didn't need it.
When?
Do I have to tell you these things?
That's such a basic thing!
And by the way, what's with the attitude?
- Then I'll get it for you.
- No, you're not doing me a favor.
It's my right.
- What's your number?
- 011-9939-0348
It's all done.
- Where's the restroom here?
- We don't have one.
Why not?
There's no restrooms in convenient stores, usually.
That makes no sense.
There must be a restroom that you use.
If you don't want to tell me, then say it.
Don't lie to me when it's obvious.
Do you shit here then?
Right here?
Then try shitting here!
Go ahead!
Outsiders are not allowed in our restroom.
Don't talk to me like that.
Let's get this straight, I'm a customer here.
What's with the service here?
I really got to go.
Hey, lady!
There's really no restroom here?
I'm not sure.
Whatever, fine!
I'm returning this.
I was getting this because of the restroom.
- OK, ma'am.
- This is killing me.
- What's wrong with this?
- It's killing me...
I'm sorry.
Hold on, please.
You're doing this on purpose right now?
Hurry up, please.
I'll be back in a minute, so have the refund ready.
Welcome.
Work's pretty tough, isn't it?
You seem pretty frustrated.
No.
This is empty.
There weren't any gimbap on the rack either.
You guys aren't selling it?
The stock isn't in yet.
So the owner didn't order them yet?
He did, but he does it a bit late.
We're sorry.
The management here seems a little iffy here.
Do you need something?
Welcome.
How've you been?
Thank you for coming.
He wasn't a customer, right?
He is... sort of, but not really.
Then who was that?
He comes to drink that soju he keeps here.
Wait... you let people keep soju here?
It's just... he doesn't want to finish it all at once, that's why...
You think this is funny?
I'm sorry.
Does the manager here know that the beggar comes by?
The manager said it's fine.
He did?
Wow... this really is something...
Hello?
Are you owner of the Seori branch?
Yes, I'm from the head branch.
It seems messy here.
The stock's not organized, the part-time worker's not nice to customers...
And strange bums coming into the store...
I'm giving you a warning.
I see that you've closed night shifts a few times too without permission.
And there's even repeated reports of not paying for workers.
You know this might lead to a cancellation of the contract, right?
We'll be watching.
If not for that scar...
I wonder what the customers will think.
Take care.
Yes, Mr. Chun.
Why is it that the head branch just called me?
- No, it's...
- I heard enough.
Just close the shop and get out.
You think I hired you to mess around at work and give you every penny?
It's not like you've seen the whole thing.
You've only listened to one side of the story.
I just got a call from the head branch, so isn't it pretty obvious?
!
I can't work with kids like you, so get out of there right now.
Sounds good.
It's not like I'm going to work here forever.
You're fired, so close the store and get the hell out!
- Mr. Chun.
- What?
If you backstab someone who's worked this hard then no one can work with you!
What is this crap!
1002-3472-0572365.
Nonghyup Bank.
Kim Min-hee.
Is something wrong?
I just got fired.
Oh no, on such a nice day...
I'll just look for another job, I guess.
What about the store here?
He told me to shut it and get the hell out.
What in the world...
Think it this way.
You've gotten rid of bad luck.
Are you really giving this to me?
Of course!
Sorry I'm late.
The bus stopped on the way, so I had to walk here all the way from that hill.
Strange neighborhood, really.
Sorry for keeping you waiting so long...
It's okay.
- What's that?
- I didn't tell you yesterday?
You have to check this every morning for the inventory.
So much to learn...
It's better when you don't know these things.
- Hi.
- Welcome.
Here you go.
Two, four, six, eight 800s, two 2000s.
- You check first...
- OK.
...and sign off at the end.
- Wait a minute, you're new here.
- Me?
- You look really cute, lady.
- Oh, her?
She's pretty too.
But you're a real cutie.
See you again, cutie pie.
Bye.
Lucky you're cute, Hana.
No.
I mean, you're incredibly pretty.
That guy's weird.
I've no idea why all guys are like that.
Gosh, it's so cheesy...
Let me try.
So how was it?
Can I have Cigar No. 3?
Really?
I'm almost home now.
That'll be 3,500 won.
Alright.
- Let's do that.
- That's 5,000 won.
You need a receipt?
No thanks.
1,500 won, your change.
Thank you for stopping by.
OK.
See you soon.
Thank you.
He was cute.
Was he talking to his girlfriend?
Eunyoung.
Are you with someone?
- Are you interested?
- Sorry?
That guy?
No way!
If not, that's fine.
By the way...
Have you eaten anything yet?
I think you'd look good with bangs.
Do you want me to cut it for you?
Eunyoung, come here.
Ta-da!
I applied to cosmetics for college, you know.
I used to take care of all of my friends' bangs.
- Hey, isn't that rapper guy ass-kicking?
- You mean Jae-min?
He's aight.
- Wait, how do you know his name?
- None of your business, girl.
What's so good about that fat-ass?
He's bursting with fat.
- Don't be cussing at our guy like that, OK?
- 'Our guy'?
He's mine!
- He's mine!
- You've gotta be kiddin'.
Shut up, you bitches.
I just remembered.
You girls hear about it?
Kim Yu-ri in Class B. She's a lesbo.
- O.M.G.
- I think I wanna puke.
For real?
Completely 'holy shit'.
ROFLMAO.
Is that girl crazy?
- That's what I'm saying.
- Fuckin' disgusting.
What if she comes after me?
Oh, shit...
Stop exaggerating, you crazy bitch.
She's got eyes, too.
You think she'd be crazy to go all over you?
Looking like an asshole.
You fuckin' cunts...
Hey, let's go get some ciggies.
No, I'm gon' get some snack for Soohyun.
This Plus cigarettes, please.
We don't sell cigarettes to underaged people.
I'm sorry?
I always come here to get them.
We don't sell them.
What the fuck.
Hey, didn't you say you had to charge your phone?
Can I charge my phone here?
- That'll be 3,500 won.
- Hey, Gollum.
You got 1,000 won?
You money-raking bitch...
always borrowing 1,000 wons.
- Knew you'd do this again.
- I only got a 10,000 won bill.
Give it to me.
Come back in about half an hour.
That'll be 1,000 won.
I look so good.
Lesbos would totally fall for me.
Jesus Christ.
Seriously, for real?
Hurry up, we're gon' be late for class.
You fuckin' lesbo faggots.
I've had enough.
What was that?
'what the fuck?
'
Cussing around here in broad daylight and getting cigs when you should be in school.
Should at least change your damn school uniforms before coming here,
- you fucking assholes.
- What'd we do?
- I'm sorry.
- We're on our way back to school.
- She's right.
- We're going to be late!
Let's go.
Watch your mouths in front of grownups.
I've had enough, so get out.
- We're sorry...
- what're you apologizing for?
Were you surprised?
I'm not usually like this.
Gosh, it's scorching hot.
Hyunsoo, did you mean what you said?
What do you mean?
That you'll wait for me.
I can bear 21 months.
It's nothing to me.
You're not meeting with someone else, are you?
- Motherfucker, get in there.
- Stay still.
Sit, I have a knife.
- Hey, open this!
Quickly!
- Head down!
Head down, you fucker.
Head down!
Fuck!
Heads down.
Go inside, you shithead.
You fucker.
C'mon, let's take it!
You fuckers.
What you looking at?
Stop staring!
- Hey!
Hey, catch her!
- Catch that bitch!
You fuckers, get in there.
Go fuckin' get her!
Hey, bitch!
Look, won't you stay still?
I'll kill you, alright?
!
- You got it?
- Yeah, I did.
I told you not to stare at me, didn't I?
Hey, hey!
Stop staring... heads down.
- What the fuck.
- Eunyoung!
Eunyoung!
- What the fuck!
Catch her!
Catch her!
- Eunyoung...
Sit down, you bitch!
Shit, we're fucked.
Completely fucked.
- Shut it!
- Careful!
Might get hurt!
Stay still!
- Go back this way.
- Get in, you bitch!
Hey!
I got everything!
Let's leave!
Right now!
- Don't look at my face!
- Shit!
Mr. Chun Doo-hwan!
I'm from the Seoul Central District Court.
It's me here...
Are you Mr. Chun's mother?
Yes, what's going on?
He's never left this place empty before.
The lights are still on.
He's not in there?
Try opening the door.
We can't do that since it's Mr. Chun's property.
What's going on...
Doo-hwan?
Mt.
Halla's soaring spirit protecting our people
Doo-hwan?
Our long history passing as the hibiscus blooms and falls off
O, wise nation and people We've come a long way
The shining morning sun rising in the East Sea
Our beautiful mountains and rivers Here lies my county
Doo-hwan?
Doo-hwan...
Doo-hwan...
Mr. Chun did not carry out his obligations as a debtor to pay back to the creditor.
Therefore, the Seoul Central District Court will cease all sales and transactions of Mr Chun's property, goods, and rights according to the law.
Based on Articles 496 and 497 of the Constitution, it will proceed in acquiring and seizing his property.
Fuck, just grab anything you can.
Do we really have to do this?
It's money you should've gotten anyways.
Hurry up!
How do I open this?
Neither do I. Just pack it and let's head home.
Shit, you fucking retard.
Don't take that off, sir.
If you keep at it, I can charge you for obstruction of justice.
PROPERTY ATTACHMENT NOTICE
Based both on the contract between Mr. Chun, and the head branch of the franchise and legal regulations concerning merchandise transactions, all goods within the store belong to the head branch and cannot be seized.
Therefore, the head branch announces that the Seoul Central District Court's legal decision is void.
SEIZED PROPERTY
welcome!
What can I get for you?
A pack of This Plus cigs.
- Um, can I see your I. D?
- You can't tell?
Just get me one.
I can't sell without seeing your ID.
We're in the same spot, man.
Just chill.
Hey, didn't you hear me?
Welcome!
Hey, fucker.
You think this is funny?
What school do you go to?
You go to Kwangjin High School?
No.
- Then Yongin?
- No.
Don't fuck with me, dick.
I saw you in school!
No, you didn't.
- What grade are you in?
- I don't go to school...
Stop joking around, you fucker!
I saw you in the hallway.
Here...
He's 23.
The fuck is this.
Holy shit, you're fucking old.
Please, act your age, Sir.
Cut that polite shit with me, you motherfucker!
Thanks for watching @ myasiantv.se
Josie's on a vacation far away
Come around and talk it over
So many things that I wanna say
You know I like my girls a little bit older
I just wanna use your love tonight
Ooh!
Unh, unh.
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
Unh.
I ain't got many friends left to talk to
Nowhere to run when I'm in trouble
You know I'd do anything for you
Stay the night but keep it undercover
I just wanna use your love tonight
Oh, yeah
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
Shit.
What the hell?
Oh, man.
Not another one.
I shouldn't have been looking for my chapstick, buddy.
You're just stunned, I think.
Yeah.
I mean, you got the wind knocked out of you.
I did that on a jungle gym.
Had the wind knocked out of me too.
I'll give you a couple seconds.
You'll be fine.
Yeah.
Come on.
Maybe you just need a little...
You want mouth-to-mouth, man?
Maybe that'll help.
I just...
I don't want you to bite my mouth.
There you go.
That's helping.
Okay, come on.
Let's walk it off, man.
Get up on all fours.
You can...
Attaboy!
Run!
Look at you go!
There you go!
Got a good gait.
Got a good gait.
Yes!
Your love...
Where are my chicken sandwiches, Larry?
Come on, let's go.
Somebody get these.
Oh, my God.
Tammy, get over here.
You're late again.
Do you own a watch much?
I know I'm late.
A deer jumped out of nowhere.
You look like crud.
Oh, my God.
Get off the floor.
Tammy, my office.
Now.
I'm coming, Keith.
God.
Tammy, do you know how I got to where I am?
Sucking dick and kissing ass?
Excuse me, Keith.
We need some more ketchup.
Okay.
English, though, Javier.
This is America.
- It was English.
- That wasn't English.
- Is that blood?
- Yeah.
A deer hit my car on the way in.
- You should maybe see a doctor.
- No kidding.
Okay, thanks, Javier.
That's great advice.
See you later.
Tammy, I'm terminating your employment at Topperjack's.
You've gotta be shitting me.
No, I'm terminating your employment.
I need your badge.
What ba...?
You mean my name tag?
- Yes, exactly.
I need your badge back.
- It's not a badge.
It's a name tag, and you made me buy it with my own money.
That's company policy.
I need it back.
Well, I need you to stop sweating through your shirts and grossing everybody out.
It is hot.
And when it's hot, people sweat.
- Not like that.
Not like that.
- It's how it is.
- That shit's medical.
- Listen!
Tammy, you have already been fired.
I have already terminated your employment.
You are at least 40 seconds fired... so please exit the Topperjack's.
Fine.
You know what?
I'm gonna give you this.
- Tammy.
- I got it here.
- It's your middle finger.
- No.
Poom.
Read between the lines.
I knew that you were gonna do it, so it's not as good.
- I get it, Tammy.
- Poom.
You get that?
- What is that?
- A little version of this.
Hey, don't let a deer hit you on the way out.
You dick.
You know what?
Don't let these ketchup packets get stuck in your gross armpits.
- You'll have to buy new shirts, you dick.
- Those are Topperjack's supplies.
You are no longer an employee of Topperjack's.
- Oh.
- Yeah, that shit's contaminated now!
For overtime due, Keith.
Overtime due.
- Tammy, just get out.
- Enjoy the special sauce.
Do not touch the Tower Deluxe burgers.
Those buns are still good.
Just change the hats.
Yeah.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.
- I'm calling the police!
Uh, just thought you should know that the meat here is real shitty.
- Oh, God.
- Real, real, real shitty.
- That's the truth.
- That's not true.
That's not chicken.
I don't know what it is, but it's not bird.
It's 110 percent chicken.
Bird doesn't come out of squeezy tubes.
My gut fear, it's mostly dick and beak.
- She's disgruntled.
- You know what?
- Oh.
- Aah, my elbow!
Poom.
Later, loser.
Oh, are you...?
Shit.
You kidding me?
Aw, man.
Shit.
A little help?
A little help?
A little help!
Come on!
Yeah, karma.
Yeah, we'll see.
God.
Hey, Greg.
I'm home.
Think your ringer's off.
I've been calling you.
That asshole Keith fired me.
Can you believe that shit?
Like, who would wanna work there?
How much I feel
Feel for you, baby
What's going on here?
Hey, Tammy.
Wow, you're home so early.
- I'm sorry you got fired.
- Shut up, Missi.
Why are you in my house making my husband dinner?
Uh, actually, I made her dinner.
You're gonna get your ass kicked.
You hungry?
You wanna eat my fist for din...?
Ow!
Shit.
I am so sorry, Tammy.
You startled me.
Keep your dirty fingers out of my mouth.
You scratched my tongue.
I'm leaving you, Greg.
I'm taking the household money and getting out of here.
God!
Nice, Greg!
You have to cheat with the neighbor?
You can forget about me feeding your stupid cats, Missi.
- I'm divorcing you, and I'm suing you, bitch.
- For what?
For being an asshole.
That's what I'm suing you for.
Why is there only $63 in here, Greg?
Whatever.
I'm keeping all of it.
- Ow!
Shit.
- Are you okay?
I'm fine!
I feel great.
Pervs.
Assholes.
You two deserve each other.
Shit.
Goddamn it.
Just don't touch anything.
And don't let her touch my underwear.
You know, you never made me dinner.
Not even once.
And it smells really good too.
Yeah, I'll see you in court!
I hope you both choke on your shitty dinner!
Assholes.
Missi Jenkins is a whore!
And I kicked her ass!
Kicked her stupid ass.
Don't call me, Greg, when she dumps you!
Because I won't call you back!
No fucking way!
I'm gonna be too busy fucking models and shit!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom, open the door!
Greg's cheating on me, Mom.
- What?
- Yeah, I know.
What a jerk, right?
What happened?
I went home after a shitty day, and Greg and Missi Jenkins... are having, like, a really romantic dinner at our dining room table.
And Greg made it.
Okay, then I'm sorry.
That's terrible.
I'm not exactly thrilled about it myself.
I just need to borrow your car.
Why?
Where's yours?
Mine is smoking on Highway 13 because a deer jumped out in front of me.
Can I just have your car so I can get out of this shitty town?
I will drive you to work.
I'm not giving you my car.
I don't need you to drive me to work, okay?
Keith fired me.
Little prick.
- Are we really gonna do this again, Tammy?
- What?
Every time something bad happens, you throw a fit... say you're leaving, you never get more than 10 miles outside of town... you start feeling sorry for yourself, and you come back and throw another fit.
- That's not true.
- It's a pattern.
It's not a pattern.
- It is.
- That's not even what a pattern is.
A pattern is a thing that comes in pairs of two.
You just don't know science.
A pattern is a series of things or events... that repeat themselves on and on, sometimes into infinity.
That's what a galaxy is.
It's not a pattern.
- Fine.
- God.
If you don't wanna help me, just give me the keys to Dad's truck.
- No.
Absolutely not.
- Fine.
Then I'm gonna take Grandma's car.
- No, you're not.
She is old and not well.
- Then she doesn't need a car.
Right?
You answer that.
- Don't go.
Tammy.
- Grandma, I need your car keys.
Yep, I heard everything, and I am ready to go.
I'm taking your car.
I'm not taking you.
- You're not getting my car unless you take me.
- No.
- Oh, yeah.
What?
- Mom.
- What, you packed a bag?
- Yeah.
Wait a minute.
No one is going anywhere.
I am.
I'm just not taking this asshole with me.
Hey.
You're not exactly my first choice for a traveling companion either... but you're the best bet I have to get out of this stupid house.
I'm sorry, Deborah, but it is a stupid house.
And I hate it.
I love you, but I am not gonna die in this house alone.
You're not gonna die here alone.
You're gonna die here with me and Don.
- That's a shitty thing to say.
- That's a very shitty thing to say.
I meant it in a good way.
- What's a good way?
- Oh, my God.
Never mind.
- Shitty.
- Very shitty.
Your doctor says you have to take it easy.
Dr. Lansing is an imbecile.
Do we have a deal?
No offense, but no fucking way.
I have $6700 in cash.
Bullshit.
Prove it.
Yeah.
That's gonna do it.
- Mom.
Tammy.
- You snooze, you lose.
This is ridiculous.
Don't call me at 2 a.m. looking for a ride.
- Yeah, I won't.
- Mom.
Please tell me you have your pills.
- Oh, Deborah, unclutch.
- Goddamn it.
I'm gonna call Brookview.
- I swear to God.
- You do what you need to, baby.
Bye, Mom.
Not a good idea.
It's a little swollen.
It's okay.
What's Brookview?
It's an old folks' home.
Like a prison for old people.
Horrible place.
I don't know where I'm going.
I've always wanted to go to Niagara Falls.
Okay.
That was a stop sign.
Yeah, I'm aware of that.
I know that.
All right, do you think we could just try to be pleasant?
What do you say?
- How about a beer?
- No.
- Um, whiskey.
- Jesus, no.
Oh, my God.
You're pregnant.
I'm driving a car, Grandma.
Do you see what I'm doing?
Just because you can't see through your Magoo goggles... doesn't mean I'm not doing what I'm doing.
All right.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
God.
You know what?
Screw it.
Give me a beer.
Oh.
Yes.
Okay, here you go.
One little beer can't hurt, right?
- Lock the door.
- Spin it, spin it, spin it.
I got it.
- Hello, cows.
- Ha-ha-ha.
I'm sorry you're so tasty, cows.
I'm gonna fuck you up between two sesame buns.
Whoa!
That's a bump.
Aah!
I stuck the landing!
You wanna go ride a cow?
Oh, shit.
- Where the hell are we?
- Shh, shh, shh.
Come here.
When I was a young girl, I used to feed deer... right out of my hand at my grandparents' cabin.
And there was this one deer...
Hyah!
Hyah!
Get out of here!
Get out of here.
You never did appreciate nature.
Not when it totals my Corolla.
No.
Thank you.
How the hell did we even get in here?
Oh, my God.
- You know what?
- What?
I think this is some X-Files shit.
- For sure.
- I don't know.
You know what?
If we die out here, we're just raccoon food.
- Ha, ha.
- It's not funny.
I saw that on a show.
- Let's go.
Get in the car.
We're going home.
- Home?
- Yeah.
Home.
- What?
You're always talking about how much you wanna get out of that town... and we finally are out of it.
And then one little thing happens, and you just wanna just run on back?
Come on.
Let's go.
Fine.
I'm not surprised.
You always were a quitter.
- I'm not a quitter.
- Yes, you are.
Yeah?
Really?
Does a quitter do this?
- Aah!
God, I got it stuck.
- It's all right.
Go ahead.
Push.
- That's it.
Little bit more.
- It's crushing it.
- That's okay.
Crush it.
You got it.
- I am not a quitter!
- You're a doer.
- I am a doer.
That's it.
That's it.
You got it.
You got it.
- Do it.
Do it.
There you go.
- Aah!
I am not a quitter!
- Oh, Shit.
- Aah!
Who's a quitter now?
- Aah!
- Whoa.
Oh.
Sorry about that!
You should wear a helmet.
FYI.
Whoa.
- Oh, God.
- "Mark Twan National Forest."
- Where are we?
- We're in Missouri.
We went in the wrong direction.
And you do know who Mark Twain is, right?
I know who he is.
Good guy.
He's a good guy.
Okay, Tammy.
- Tammy, listen up.
- What?
Well, you're at a crossroads, right?
You could change the trajectory of your whole life.
You've got time.
I've got money.
You don't wanna go back to that town.
You deserve to have a little fun.
Right?
There's no alcohol on the dock.
It's my juice.
One hand!
- Well, that's not safe.
- No.
I am ripping shit up!
Yeah!
Enjoy my spray!
Because I'm spraying you!
Slow down!
Look at that.
She is so brave.
Coming in hot!
I am coming in smoking hot!
Smoking hot!
Might be too hot!
Throttle's jammed!
Too hot!
Oh, my God.
Tammy?
Tammy!
Tammy!
Oh, my God.
You scared the shit out of me.
I can't believe this.
Aw, shit.
I lost my glasses.
Shit.
Are you kidding?
Forty-eight hundred dollars?
Is that your scam?
Huh?
You like taking money from little old ladies?
You break it, you buy it.
You're lucky I don't call the police.
That machine malfunctioned on me.
You're gonna be hearing from my lawyer.
All right, just stop it, Tammy.
Here you go, $4800.
Don't give him cash.
Put it on your card and dispute it later.
I do it all the time.
I don't believe in credit cards.
Cash is real.
You should be charging shit like crazy, because you're old.
- By the time they come to get it, you might not...
- Go in the car.
- ...still be here.
You could be dead.
- Get in the car.
- I'm trying to help you with your business.
- Get in the car.
- Hey.
- Dick.
She's an idiot.
Muscle shirts are for muscles.
I said I'm sorry about the 4 grand.
Four thousand 800 bucks.
"Four thousand 800 bucks."
Pay you back.
There we go.
How much you put in?
Thirty bucks of gas, and we won $10.
Ooh, halfsies.
Hey, hang on, I wanna clean out the junk in this...
On the floor.
Wait a minute.
There's garbage all over the floor.
You're taking your old-people pills and stuff, right?
Yeah.
I don't need them, but, um, I'm taking them.
Wait a minute, let me get up all this junk.
We should frame this.
Okay, come on, get in.
- I have to pee.
- Why didn't you go at the gas station?
- I'm gonna pull over.
You can go in the woods.
- Oh, no.
No way.
So why do you wanna go to Niagara Falls, anyway?
Well, I was supposed to go with my daddy.
He was gonna take me when I was about 8 or 9.
But he got too busy working.
And then he got too busy getting sick and dying.
- So I never did get to see it.
- Oh.
And now... some 60-odd years later...
I'm gonna get to see Niagara Falls with you, with my granddaughter.
Don't you think that's pretty special?
I think so.
Are you sitting on a couch or a toilet?
Because this is like a therapy session.
Hey!
Come here!
Yeah?
Look at this thing.
- Do you believe that?
- No.
- Right?
- Right.
It's amazing.
America, huh?
- Really, yeah.
- Yeah.
It says he carved it with a chainsaw.
- Do you believe that?
- I do.
I can't believe that's possible.
You do that with a chainsaw... and create that kind of artwork, the end.
You just...
I think you should just slam that chainsaw down and be like:
"Look What I did."
Yeah, it's...
It's cool.
It's okay.
- I like it.
- "Okay"?
It's majestic.
- Heh.
- It's not "okay."
I mean, that is super cool.
You're just jealous.
- Oh, please.
- What've you ever done that's that cool?
- Uh...
- Nothing.
Short list.
I watched Neil Armstrong walk on the moon.
- Wait, on his bike?
- That's Lance.
I don't care which brother it is.
That's still lame compared to this.
Boo.
I had a six-month relationship with one of the Allman Brothers.
Right.
Yeah, me too.
Heh.
- Bullshit.
- Watch your language.
It happened.
Oh, my God.
Did you really have an affair with Gregg Allman?
No.
With Duane.
Who?
Duane Allman.
The brother.
- Did you at least get to meet Gregg?
- Of course.
I got to meet him a lot.
I was on the bus for most of their first tour.
- What?
- Yes.
I have to say that's, like, one of the coolest things... anyone in our family has ever, ever, ever done... like, going back to when we were cave people.
Probably is, actually.
I never thought of it that way.
I got to run to keep from hidin'
- Remember that?
- That's good.
And I'm bound to keep on ridin'
- And I've got one more
- One more
Silver dollar
And, like, he goes low.
I ain't gonna let 'em catch me, no
Ain't gonna let 'em...
Go low.
Midnight rider
- Get your chin out.
You do it...
- Rider
- Not, like, in a weird way.
- Rider
- And I got one more silver dollar
- One more silver dollar
Little lower.
You're off.
Listen.
Let you, no
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
- That's it.
Better.
Better.
- Der-ner-ner der-ner-ner, bom
You know, one time, I got fingered by Boz Scaggs.
Tammy.
No, it's okay.
It turns out it wasn't actually Boz Scaggs.
- Okay.
- It's a good bird.
Yeah.
Sweetie, it's a great bird.
Yes, we're here.
We found it.
Yep, we're here.
You know what?
I can smell it from the parking lot.
I think you're right.
She says this is the best BBQ in the city.
Then let's have dinner and get off the phone.
Oh, no, sweetie.
We can't.
Thanks.
- We already checked in to a hotel.
- Give me my phone.
Bye.
- We'll see you tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Love you.
Bye.
- Don't hit me.
- What are you doing?
- Give me my phone.
- We're not going to see Lenore.
- Why?
Because hanging out with an old lesbian is not my idea of a good time.
Oh, don't be silly.
She's an amazing woman.
She's remarkable.
She just lives life.
She just grabs it by the horns.
I mean, you could learn a lot from her.
If you paid attention.
- Are you...?
- What?
- Don't do that.
- What?
- Ugh.
- What?
What are you, gay for Lenore?
You love her so much?
She is my cousin.
My God.
Would it be so terrible if I were gay?
I don't care if you're gay...
Can we please just stop talking about your twang?
- I'm very proud of my twang.
- Ugh!
Mm, mm.
I am loving this brisket.
How's yours?
It's really good.
I love the bark.
- And I would know because I'm a bark shark.
- Mm.
Sittin' on his mama's knee
There are some juicy-looking gentlemen in here tonight.
- Ha, ha.
- I think we might just get lucky.
- I might.
- You might.
Don't know about you.
It'd show Greg, wouldn't it?
Yeah.
Ah.
You know what?
It's too easy for me.
I mean, I can go out there, and I can get any guy in this room.
- Really?
- I don't know what it is.
But guys have always been drawn to me.
Kind of like flies on shit.
You might in the future wanna say "bees to honey."
Why?
What is this power?
I would like to see this power in action right now.
- Yeah?
You ready?
- Yes.
All right.
You better get a notebook out and a sharp pen.
- This is gonna be a goddamn clinic.
- I can't wait.
You show me, girl.
- Pay attention.
- Uh-huh.
Go ahead.
I got two.
I got two.
You wanna buy me a drink and slide some parts around?
I'm sorry.
What?
- Like that?
Is that what you want?
- I, um...
- What?
- Unh.
Wrong answer.
You wanna buy me some drinks and get up in this?
I'm gonna pass, but thanks.
Well, fuck you, and fuck you too.
Poom!
Fuckers.
Stupid.
I think they were together.
That must be why.
Oh.
Now, that makes sense.
You can't work your magic on that, right?
I mean, I'm magic, but not...
It's cool.
I didn't get...
Hey, I'm cool with your lifestyle choice.
- Yeah.
Gay it up.
- What?
I didn't know.
Here you go.
- Thanks.
- To your honey.
- Oh.
Hoo.
- Mm, mm, mm.
Now, let's turn your honey back to the music.
"Turn my honey."
Mm.
I just got that.
I just got "bees to honey."
It does sound better than "flies on shit."
- Yeah.
- Because "flies on shit" would...
- Mean you're...
- Yeah.
All right.
I'm gonna keep that cataloged because I use that a lot.
- Okay.
- Whoo!
Mm, mm, mm.
I like your hat!
When he was a new baby boy
Sittin' on his mama's knee
He picked up a hammer And a little piece of steel
Three o'clock.
Got something on the radar at 3...
That's 9.
- Where are you putting your 12?
- Straight ahead.
Look at 3.
Three, 3, 3.
Oh, boy.
He's coming over.
He's coming over.
He's coming over.
- All right.
- Hi there.
A little birdie told me you might need some more beer.
Well, that's one smart little birdie.
You two sisters?
No.
She's like 100.
- Ow.
- I'm Earl, and this is my boy.
Howdy.
I'm Pearl, and that's my Tammy.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Oh.
Good grip.
Thank you.
- Mm-hm.
What's your name, Good Grip?
- I'm Bobby Tillman.
- Yeah, you are.
Huh.
Yeah, I am.
Yeah, you are.
What do you do for a living?
I run my dad's farm.
- Cool.
- Right.
Hey, Connie, can you bring some shooters over here?
This lady would like to get intoxicated.
- That'll work, won't it?
- Oh.
So farm, huh?
Yep.
- Dancing juice.
That's what we need.
- Thank you.
Hey, babe, here I am I'm a man on the scene
I can give you what you want But you've got to come home with me
I have got some good old lovin' And I got some more in store
When I get through throwing' it on you You've got to come back for more
Boys and things that come by the dozen That ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Hey, little thing, let me light your candle 'Cause, Mama, I'm so hard to handle, now
- It gets around
- Whoo!
All right.
Ha-ha-ha.
All right.
Thank you very much.
We're gonna take a little break.
One more time!
That was amazing.
Whoo!
We gotta take a break!
Whoo!
Oh, my God.
Ha, ha.
Oh!
You need a cool-off.
Right?
I am so sweaty.
I was ripping it up out there.
Everybody was kind of really just working as a unit.
I kept calling you in.
Did you see me?
- You looked great out there.
Yeah.
- Oh.
- Well, I can move.
- Yeah.
Ha, ha.
You're so bad.
- Dad.
- Mm?
What?
What?
Don't you think it's time to go?
Well, look, Bobby, let's not be rude, okay?
I haven't finished my drink yet.
Now that's gonna take a little bit of time.
I'm going to the bathroom.
When I come back, we're leaving.
I don't care if you finish your drink.
Ooh.
I'm gonna go pick up that hint he just dropped.
Hey, is this the bathroom line?
Um, what are you doing?
Just wondering where your wife is tonight.
- I'm not married.
- Let's light this candle.
Whoa.
Okay.
All right.
Come on.
I do not want your tongue in my mouth.
Then where do you want it, man?
No, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
You just...
- You're welcome.
- Okay.
Not a chance.
Good set, man.
Thanks a lot.
Just ditching me in there.
Can't find my grandma anywhere.
Do you know where she is?
I do, unfortunately.
Oh!
God!
Hey!
- Just go away.
We're fine.
- God.
I think she took my keys.
Did you take my keys, Grandma?
Are you kidding me?
Come on.
Dad.
Cut it...
Oh, man.
- Ee!
- Oh, my God.
- Oh!
- I don't wanna know what that was.
Ugh.
That's a shitty way to end the night.
You're telling me.
Sorry I, you know, made that... little pass at you...
- ...in there.
- "Little pass"?
- Tsk.
- That was kind of aggressive.
Damn it, I'm saying I'm sorry.
No, it's okay.
I was flattered.
It was just surprising.
You know.
Honestly, for the night as a whole... it wasn't the worst thing that happened.
Do I say "thank you" to that?
- Yeah, there's a compliment in there.
- In there somewhere.
Oh, God.
Don't look.
- Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
- I just told you not to look.
Why did you look?
I tried to save you from that.
Because by saying it, it's like an invitation to look.
It's like if somebody says, "Does this smell weird to you?"... and they put it out, you lean in and you smell it.
You don't smell it.
But you do.
You lean in and you smell it.
I would not smell something if somebody told me not to smell it.
- I can guarantee you that.
- I don't think that's true.
- Dad.
All right, enough!
- We're only at first base.
Oh, boy, here comes second.
Dad, this is not fair to Mom.
Come on, man.
- "Mom"?
- It's complicated.
Yeah, you think?
I think so.
- Hey, Grandma!
- Sorry, nobody's home.
- That asshole is married!
- Come on, Dad.
- He's married!
- Sorry, darling, the inn is closed.
I'm sorry, but he is an asshole.
I agree.
He's a little bit of an asshole.
I can't...
Will you do me a favor?
My mom is home alone and she's sick, and I need to get back with her.
So do you have like a pen or something I could borrow real quick?
Yeah, I think so.
All right.
Look.
If they come out of there at a certain point... just give me a call and I'll come pick him up.
Here.
Thank you.
I knew you were into me.
I got your digits.
Sorry, that was stupid.
That was dumb.
All right, Tammy.
Thanks for holding down the fort.
I appreciate it.
Yeah, I'll watch him.
Appreciate it.
- Thanks.
- Good luck.
Thanks.
Bye, Bobby.
Bye.
Oh!
Yes, Earl.
You know who she fucked?
Duane Allman.
Yeah, she fucked the wrong Allman Brother.
Enjoy that.
- It's 119, Grandma.
I said it. 119, 119.
- 119. 119.
Could you not do...?
Can I just have my shit back?
No, no.
Come on.
A gentleman always carries a lady's things.
- Oh, bingo. 119.
You're right. 119.
- Yeah, great.
So you wanna come in for, um...
- ...some color TV or sex?
- Yeah.
Mm.
No.
We had a deal.
Yeah.
Bullshit.
Don't you dare.
Don't you dare.
You are too old to be this strong.
Open this door, Grandma.
Goddamn it.
Hey, Tammy.
- We need some ice, baby.
Okay?
- Yeah.
Fuck you, Earl.
- Fuck you.
- Aw.
Ow.
- Come on.
- Oh.
Aah!
Oh, shit.
I gotta...
I gotta pee.
All right.
Let's go for B2.
You piece of shit.
I paid for you.
Come on, you tasty motherfucker.
Yeah, now who wins?
Me.
Tammy?
Hey, Tammy.
Tammy.
Tammy, what are you doing out here?
Oh.
They wouldn't let me in the room.
You slept outside?
Oh, my God.
Here, let me help you up.
Come here.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
Of course.
Oh.
You're all dirty.
She took my keys... and I just didn't want them driving off and doing something stupid.
That's why I gave you my number.
You should have called me.
Oh, I didn't think you meant that.
I said it.
I meant it.
Okay?
All right, Dad, come on.
We gotta go.
I'm sorry about all this.
Well, I mean, you didn't do it.
I'm the one who's supposed to be keeping him out of trouble.
I don't think you're very good at it.
- Ha, ha.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm tired.
- No, I think you might be right.
Oh, God.
Tammy, what are you doing out here?
All right.
Let's go, boy.
Dad.
Truck's this way.
Gotcha.
- Well...
- Well.
I guess this is goodbye again.
Yep.
I'll take care of that one.
You take care of that one?
Okay.
- See you, Bobby.
- See you, Tammy.
Thanks again.
Yep.
- Get that out of your way.
Sure.
- I am so hungry.
Thank you.
Mm.
It's been such a long time since I've had a good servicing.
You know what I mean?
Ha, ha.
Pass me the ketchup.
Please.
You know, I didn't bring you on this trip to babysit you.
You are on this trip because of me.
Because of my car and my money.
What's left of it.
So you just watch your mouth.
Yeah, I'm too busy watching you screw crusty old men in dirty hotel rooms.
Oh, God, here we go.
You gonna blame me for everything, like always?
I do.
I blame you for shoving me out of a hotel room last night... and letting me sleep outside like a dog.
You're on your second Bloody Mary.
It's not even 10 a.m.
This is vegetables.
I blame you for packing up your shit and making me come home from school when I was 10... and finding an empty room, that's what I blame you for.
You know how shitty that was for a little kid?
You left me all alone.
- Your parents were there.
- It's not the same.
You were my best friend, and you just left me.
I'm probably gonna need a tetanus shot because I got nipped by a raccoon last night.
All right.
Tammy, I know I've done some wrong things in my life... but you don't know everything.
I know I don't need you, and I don't need your money.
- But I'm gonna take your car.
- What?
- Let's see how you like getting left.
- Don't you leave me here.
You cannot leave me here.
You come back here.
All right, now sit down.
Anybody wanna screw my grandma?
Just get her a drink.
- Hi, Mom.
- Tammy, put Grandma on.
Uh, she's in the bathroom right now.
Tammy, she left all of her pills here.
High blood pressure, heart, everything.
She's diabetic.
She cannot go unmedicated.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
- I get that.
- Listen to me.
She thinks she can handle it, but she can't.
- Tammy.
- Yeah, I know she can't.
- Bye, Mom.
- I don't think you do, because you...
Tammy.
Don?
Shit.
You gotta be kidding me.
One.
Two.
One.
- Two.
- I told you you can't drink in here.
- One.
Two.
- I'm calling the cops.
- You don't have to call the cops.
I got her.
- Oh.
Well.
Look who came back.
Yeah.
I came back.
- You did it, huh?
- What?
Drunk by 11.
Mm.
Ah.
What do I win?
Car ride with me.
Come on.
I'm pretty sure you've had enough.
You know, this is real cherry.
And guess what my secret ingredient is.
Try some.
Is it whiskey?
No.
It's whiskey.
Ha-ha-ha.
- All right.
Let me just...
- No.
- Let's go.
- This is mine.
- I need my beer.
- You got beer?
Yeah.
I got beer.
- They're still in the store.
- Bye.
Okay, we're leaving right now.
- Just get the drunk out of here.
- You know what?
- All right.
Watch it.
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.
Thanks for the beer.
- What?
Yeah, nice try.
I'm not buying you beer.
No, you don't have to.
I already bought it for them because these are my new friends.
This is Jesse.
And the girl.
And we have an arrangement... where I'm getting them the beer, and they're gonna give me a ride out of here.
How?
On their bikes?
The fucking old lady promised us a beer, so give it to me.
Don't swear in front of my grandma, you piece of shit.
Hey, you're being a real bitch, lady.
Don't say "lady." I'm not that much older than you.
What do you care?
If you don't give us beer, we're gonna turn to drugs...
I hope you do drugs.
I want you to do bath salts and then eat her face off.
- Just give it to me.
- No!
- I'll take that.
- Cool it, Jesse.
Don't shake the beer.
It's gonna explode.
I thought you were cool.
Stop it, Jesse.
- I'm not afraid to hit a girl.
- Neither am I.
Get off me!
Get off me, you fucking rat!
Yeah, nice jeans shorts.
Oh, fuck.
The cops!
Hey!
Don't.
That's my grandma's beer!
Oh, God.
I'm sorry!
- I'm sorry.
That...
- Uh-uh.
Put your hands up.
All right.
All right.
Get your hands up.
Two pens.
One half-eaten Roles.
One lighter.
Hairbrush.
One necklace.
Two bags of trail mix.
Forty-two dollars and... 10, 20... 23 cents.
Sign here.
Yeah.
- What are you doing?
- You were snoring and then you stopped.
I just wanted to check and see if you were still breathing.
I'm sorry.
Well, keep your fingers out of my nose.
No, I mean I'm sorry for landing us in here.
Well, it's not like you're the worst person in the world.
I mean, you're close, but...
I cheated on Greg.
With the ice-cream man.
You had intercourse with Jerry Miller?
No.
I didn't do it With him.
I just let him play with my boobs.
You didn't do it for the free ice cream, did you?
Not at first.
I don't know why I did it.
I think at first, I just wanted attention... and then I kind of got hooked on Klondikes.
I don't know.
Maybe I'm the worst person in the world.
Oh, I don't think that.
What's worse than Jerry Miller?
I tried to sleep with your father.
What?
I tried to sleep with your father.
Ew.
Nothing happened.
Don was a perfect gentleman.
He put me back to bed before your mother got home.
Nothing happened.
Nothing.
Look, I was not in my right mind for many years because of the drinking... and when I realized that I'd stepped over the line... where I was actually thinking of sleeping with my own daughter's husband... well, then I just didn't know what could happen and...
That's why I left.
Oh, my God.
- Grandma.
- No, don't.
Ow.
They're fine.
- My God, they look really bad.
- They're fine.
- Tammy Banks?
- Yeah.
- Let's go.
Bail's been posted.
- Okay.
Let's go.
Yeah.
I bailed you out, but I'm gonna stay a little bit longer.
Just there's a little, um... small glitch.
Let's go.
We're charging her with possession of oxycodone.
Well, she's got prescriptions for everything.
She's old.
She had 32 oxycodone pills, and they were not prescribed to her.
Judge set her bail at $3000.
We don't have that kind of money.
Jesus, she needs to get out of there now.
You know she's got diabetes and probably tons of other shit.
I've got diabetes.
Glen's got diabetes.
Diabetes is a very manageable condition.
I don't give a fuck about Glen.
I'm sorry.
I don't.
I don't know you.
My grandma needs to get out of there now.
Then you better get $3000.
- How am I supposed to do that?
- It's not my problem, lady.
- Yeah, thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.
- I didn't mean "thank you."
- I didn't mean "you're welcome."
You're done here.
You better leave while you can.
- Yeah, she did.
Yes.
- She did?
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.
Do we have, like, a Christmas account or a savings account with...?
Is she there?
Uh, yeah.
Okay, bye.
How much?
- Sixteen hundred dollars.
- What?
No, I'm not gonna fund your spring break.
Why hasn't your grandma called me back?
Could you just trust me for once, okay?
Can I just have the money?
What's wrong?
Is it Grandma?
- No.
I told you she was fine.
- Oh, God.
I told you this was a bad idea.
But you didn't wanna listen to me.
I hate to say it, but...
I told you so.
I know you're right.
But I know how to fix this now.
How are you gonna fix it?
Hello?
Tammy?
Tammy?
I gotta go.
I know what I'm gonna do.
I can do this.
Be a bad-ass.
I am a bad-ass.
I'm a bad-ass.
Aah.
My finger.
Freeze.
Nobody move.
- Shit.
Don't move.
- Okay.
Don't move.
Unh.
Dang it.
Don't even think about it.
I'm gonna need you to put all the cash in a bag.
- Okay.
- Hey, you.
Get out here.
Keep your hands where I can see them.
Hey, just make it...
I only need 1600, really.
- You don't want all of it?
- No, just 1600.
My grandma's still got 1400.
- Just make it 1650.
Round up.
- Okay.
You, give me some pies.
Give me some of the good pies.
Hey!
- What?
- Jesus.
I said, give me some of those pies.
Take them from the back so they're fresh.
All right, you, go to the other register.
- Get the higher bills.
Go.
- Okay, okay.
Reach to the back, man.
Don't give me shitty pies.
You'll regret it.
No screwing around.
I got you both covered.
All right?
But excuse me.
That's your finger, though.
Is it?
Is that just my finger?
I'm not sure.
Is it?
Shut up.
I would...
For your own sake, don't get sassy.
- Okay.
Sorry.
Yeah.
- Okay?
- Just get pie.
You want some pies?
- I like pie.
Well, get a pie out for you, get a pie out for...
If you change your attitude, I'd like to give you some pies.
On me.
No, thanks.
I don't care for them.
Goddamn it.
What did we just talk about?
I have a gun on you.
I offered you pie.
He likes pies.
He's got a gun to his face.
Anything I say, he's gonna like.
I ask you.
You want some pies?
I like pies.
Come on, that's what I'm talking about.
I feel like we're getting somewhere... and under different circumstances this would probably work out.
We'd probably be, you know, good pals.
Like, see movies and, you know.
- Yeah.
- Like, find a hot tub or...
I have one at my apartment complex.
Oh, man.
Okay.
That would be...
Fingers crossed we meet up again.
- Yeah.
- All right.
Put a stack of pies for her, a stack for me.
- I think this is all of it.
- Just get over there.
- Go.
Don't walk right toward the gun.
- Sorry.
Put pies in there.
Put them in.
Don't creep up on me like that.
Larry, seriously.
- You like apple?
- I do like apple.
But don't make me...
I don't wanna have to choose between you.
Choose Larry.
Larry, she's telling me to take you out.
It's just, you're so much older, you know?
- Oh, my gosh.
- I'm a veteran.
- That's amazing.
- Yeah.
I'm gonna have to put you in the cooler.
Come on, let's go.
Today.
Get your pies.
Let's go.
Larry, it's a real honor.
I wanna thank you for your service.
Here.
Don't know if it's a blanket or a towel, but it'll keep you warm.
I'll call the cops in 10 minutes and let them know you're in here.
Damn it.
Shit.
Come on.
Oh...
Come on.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh.
Ow.
Where do I go to bail somebody out?
- Name?
- Tammy?
- Where have you been?
- What?
- Uh, never mind.
Yeah.
- Okay.
Let's go.
- Well, slow down, slow down.
- Okay, I'm sorry.
Okay?
How did you even get out?
Well, I called Earl... and he very generously had Bobby wire the bail money to the station.
- Really?
- Mm-hm.
What are you doing with oxy?
I mean, whose pills are those?
Well, they're mine.
My foot was hurting... and my pills weren't working, so I asked the Robinson boy if he had any.
- Eugene?
Eugene's a drug dealer.
- Uh-huh.
Oh, no.
Yeah, he stands on the street and sells drugs in little sandwich bags.
- Did you think he was a pharmacist?
- He's organized.
Yeah, so was Hitler.
--courthouse grounds over the next two years... and upgrade those grounds throughout.
In other news, there was a robbery at the Oaktree Topperjack's.
Two employees were held at gunpoint.
Michelle Li joining us live at the scene.
Oh, shit.
Authorities are describing this person as 5'2", white, female.
The robber had a navy T-shirt featuring a bear with "Mahalo" written on it.
The robber was last seen driving... an older-model Cadillac, hauling a Jet Ski.
The suspect made off with $1600...
- That's quite a coincidence.
Huh?
- ...and 13 signature pies.
Yeah, and she was super bossy.
But she did give us pies, so that was cool.
We're certainly glad that you're sa...
What have you done?
Sit down.
Right now.
Sit down.
Well?
- Well, your feet were really puffy...
- Yeah.
...and they looked really messed up.
I didn't know how else to get that kind of money.
And I was afraid if I didn't get you out of there... something bad was gonna happen to you.
And I just always screw stuff up, and I didn't wanna...
- I didn't wanna screw that up.
- Oh, sweetie.
My sweet, sweet, sweet girl.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
Look at me.
You have to take that money back.
If you don't take it back, I'm gonna turn you in myself.
You gotta take the money back.
You gotta take the pies back.
All right?
I can't really take all the pies back.
Why not?
Oh, okay.
- I kind of got into them.
- Okay.
You're more bad-ass than I ever thought.
I think you take after your grandma after all.
Hmm?
All right.
- We'll fix it tomorrow.
- Yeah.
We'll fix it.
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
- I'm not wearing it.
- I just made it for you.
It's full of grease.
Look at this.
- Can you put it on before someone sees us?
- You realize how much it clogs your veins...
- Put it on.
You're killing me.
- All right.
You have to argue about everything.
Oh, that's kind of calming, actually.
Just throw the money through the window and we'll get out of here.
All right.
Fine.
Here we go.
- Oh, God.
No, I'm returning it.
- She's returning the money.
- I'm returning the money to you.
- I'm calling the police.
Oh, no.
We're gonna need more pies.
I'm not robbing you.
I'm giving it back.
God, stop freaking out.
Stop crying.
I'm returning this to you.
Listen carefully.
Keep the car running.
No, just relax.
It's okay.
Everything's normal.
It's cool.
My, uh, bandit partner, she just accidentally robbed you last night.
She didn't really mean it.
And here's the money back.
No hard feelings.
Are you the grandma?
Look right here.
None of this happened.
None of this happened.
Just relax.
None of this happened.
Oh.
What are you doing?
You said "Come a-running." I said "Keep the car running."
- You need to be more articulate.
- I have a bag on my head.
And by the way, why does mine have no expression and yours has a smiley face?
It's not smiling.
I'm showing tiger teeth.
Oh, I thought it was a mustache and a smile.
- Just go.
Go, go.
- Come on, let's get out of here.
Don't be a hero!
- Hey.
- Hey.
Where's Larry?
- He has the day off.
He's pretty shaken up.
- Oh.
Just tell him hi.
Okay.
Watch the curb, watch the curb.
Oh, Jesus, she's crying up a storm.
Somebody go hug her.
It's okay, Kathleen.
Oh, my God!
Ha-ha-ha.
Niagara Falls, here we come!
Not in this car.
We're gonna go down straight and then take a right.
- What?
- Yeah.
Oh, Lenore.
- Hey.
- Hey.
It's been too long.
Too long.
Sweetie, you look so great.
Aw.
It's great to see you.
- Come here.
- Aw.
Is this little Tammy?
Look at you.
Oh.
Darling, last time I saw you, you were knee-high to a grasshopper.
- Yeah, I'm taller.
- Yes, you are.
- You don't remember me, do you?
- No, I do.
- You wanna see some ID?
Family album?
- Ha, ha.
- She got a sense of humor?
- Yes.
Sometimes.
- Oh, darling.
How's your mom?
- Good, I think.
You know, not real thrilled with us at the moment.
Yeah, Pearly filled me in.
You knocked over a Topperjack's?
- Grandma.
- Lenore's cool.
That the vehicle you perpetrated your crime with?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
This is what we're gonna do.
Get in there and take everything out.
Clean everything out of it, all the evidence, okay?
You're on the lam.
You're a fugitive from justice.
Think about it that way.
- Jesus.
- And we'll pull that trailer off.
- And I'll pop those plates, okay?
- Okay, what do you want me to do?
Oh, honey, why don't you hunker on back down there in that RV, put your feet up?
- I got this covered.
- Okay.
- Alrighty.
- All right.
Ow.
Four dollars a gallon.
Thanks, Obamacare.
Ugh.
- I don't think this is such a good idea.
- I do.
You wanna go to prison for robbing a store?
Well, I returned the money.
Well, I'm not a lawyer... but I don't think you want the police getting ahold of this car.
Shit.
I wouldn't stand there if I was you.
Oh, man.
Oh, my God.
- Buckle up.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, holy shit.
Oh, I am so happy every time I come here.
Susanne.
- Hi.
- Hi, Pearly.
Oh, it's so good to see you.
So good to see you.
Isn't that precious?
Yes, I do remember you.
Hey, Tammy.
I haven't seen you in ages.
- Welcome, welcome.
- Thanks.
- Holy shit, you guys are loaded.
- Tammy, that is so rude.
Oh, what?
This is like Falcon Crest shit and stuff.
I thought you owned a pet food store.
Yeah, well, I own 22 of them.
- No.
- Yeah.
- Wasn't it, like, Martha's or Mabel's?
- Merlin's.
- Why Merlin's?
- Because I dig wizards, man.
- Oh, my God, I do too.
I love wizards.
- Get out of town.
I like them because they can blow shit up with their fingers.
Tammy, have you ever been to a lesbian Fourth of July party?
- Not that I know of.
- Well, they are fun.
Come on, Penny.
So let's hear this again.
I'm fascinated.
I just...
I meant it...
I meant it as a compliment.
I said you were super hot.
You know what I mean.
When I think of what a lesbian looks like...
- I think of somebody who looks more like...
- Like me?
- Ha, ha.
- Personally, I prefer the term "labisian."
- We should talk about that shirt.
- Yeah, okay.
- I love this shirt.
- I know, but it's time to give it a little break.
- What are we gonna do for the party?
- Please don't wear that shirt to the party.
Uh-oh.
You're gonna doll me up... and then I'm gonna have to be beating the ladies off with a lesbian stick.
This is the time
This is the time Now it's time to go
Mm.
There you are.
Look at you.
Oh, my gosh.
Wow.
You look so softened.
Oh.
I don't know.
Susanne made me put on Lenore's shirt.
It actually looks better on you than her.
Look at you.
Oh, my gosh.
So nice.
Well, thanks.
Hey, I don't wanna be a bummer... but I just wanna say something in a super-loving way... but could you not get shithouse tonight?
Oh.
Sure.
Easy-peasy.
- I mean it.
- Okay.
- So you wanna dance?
- No, they'll probably think we're a couple.
- Oh, it's too late for that.
Ha, ha.
Come on.
- Ha, ha.
- Look at you.
I love it.
- Really?
I can't do nothin, girl Without somebody gawkin'
I used to think that it was me But now I see it wasn't
Pearly!
Pearly!
Pearly!
- Oh, I need your help with something.
- Is something hurting?
No, no, no.
Oh, my gosh, you're a little sweaty, huh?
- I'm killing it on the dance floor.
- I know, you're dancing hard.
Well, let's just try to glow less.
Cool off.
Oh, my goodness.
Look who it is.
Hey, Tammy.
- What are you guys doing here?
- Pearl invited us.
Pearly, where's the dance floor and the bar?
Not in that order.
- This way, baby.
- Grandma.
- Sweetie, have fun.
Bye.
- See you later, son.
Well, that was fast.
I gotta say, your mom and dad have gotta have a real weird setup...
- ...because I don't get it.
- Heh.
They've actually been separated for a long time.
And she's been sick for quite a while... and he still takes care of her... so it's kind of complicated.
Yeah.
It's probably complicated.
- Anyway...
- Kind of spiffed up, aren't you?
I just put on, like, a shirt and pants.
I'm not...
Maybe a little aftershave?
Is that what I'm kind of smelling?
I put on some cologne.
- You put on man perfume to come and see me?
- No, I didn't put on ma...
Hmm?
Ha, ha.
- I think you did.
- Come on.
I'm gonna get you a drink.
It's kind of a vanilla.
Like a little...
It's not vanilla, it's regular.
It's just...
- I don't know.
- Come on.
I know.
I know what it is.
You smell like a cookie.
Shut up.
I don't smell like a cookie.
- I think you do.
- Come on.
Now you shouldn't even get into
Yeah.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, oh, oh.
Yeah.
How you gonna do it If you really don't wanna dance?
- Does that smell weird?
- No.
- I told you.
- Oh!
You made me smell it.
- I told you.
- Why did I do that?
Because I told you, if somebody says, "Does this smell weird?"...
- I don't wanna hit anybody.
- What was that?
It's a dog cookie.
Ha, ha.
I mean, a dog biscuit.
You tricked me, Tammy.
It's because I'm tricky.
I actually don't think you're tricky.
You're kind of a straightforward person.
It's one of the things I like about you a lot.
Oh.
Thanks for bailing my grandma out.
It was really nice.
Of course.
But, I mean, anybody would have done it.
No, not really.
They wouldn't have.
So it was...
Thanks.
Thanks.
Well, I'm glad I could help.
I like your hair like this, by the way.
It's nice.
I don't know.
Susanne did this weird clampy thing.
No, it's pretty.
You look really pretty.
Thanks.
I know this is stupid, but I'm still married.
And it's a shitty marriage... and it's over, but it wasn't all Greg's fault.
I was kind of an awful wife.
- You know, I just don't wanna add to the...
- No, it's okay.
- It's, you know...
I'm sorry.
- No.
Don't.
You're right.
I didn't mean to, you know...
Anyway.
You know, I get it.
You know, you get a little taste of Tammy, and then you... kind of come clamoring back for more.
- You get it?
Really?
Ha, ha.
- Yeah.
I'm like a Cheeto.
You can't eat just one.
Tammy, that's Lay's potato chips.
That's not Cheetos.
No, not for me.
I love a Cheeto.
Tammy, Bobby.
Come on, you two.
You're gonna wanna see this.
Come on.
- Oh, all right.
- Okay.
- Come on.
Chop-chop.
- We're coming.
Get your asses down here.
Hey, what did you do with the Jet Ski?
Viking burial.
It's trashed.
Viking burial.
Viking burial!
Okay.
Would you like to do the honors?
It's your craft.
Yeah, but you love blowing shit up, so...
Yeah, I do.
God help me, I do so love it.
- Go, baby.
- Get on, Lenore.
The tribe has spoken.
Although we did not have the opportunity... to feel your mighty engines thrum between our thighs... we salute your watery prowess... and we commend your spirit to Valhalla.
- Valhalla!
- Valhalla!
Go, baby.
Go, baby.
Go, baby.
- Viking burial!
- Viking!
Viking burial!
Oh, lesbians!
Attention, everybody.
- Oh, shit, Grandma.
- Hi, my name is Pearl Baizen.
Excuse me.
And I wanna take this opportunity to thank my cousin Lenore... and the beautiful Susanne for this kick-ass party.
Yeah!
Yeah.
Mm, mm, mm.
And I just wanna say happy Fourth of July!
Amen, Pearl.
Amen.
All right, enough of that.
Seriously, folks.
I wanna give a little birthday gift to America.
I don't know how old America is right now, but I just wanna say... happy birthday, America.
- Beep.
- Shit.
- Do it again!
- Yes.
- Those are beauties.
Really beauties.
- Let's go.
You're done.
You're done.
You're drunk.
What the fuck did you do?
Go get me another drink right now.
You said you weren't gonna drink.
I said I wasn't gonna drink.
Get me a drink.
Come on.
May I introduce my granddaughter, Hamburger?
What are you doing?
Cheeseburger, sorry.
She's actually Cheeseburger.
Hey, hey, hey.
What?
What?
- Don't tell me what to do.
- Just get off the...
I don't want some fat loser telling me what to do.
You're just being an asshole because you're drunk, and it's not okay.
Hey, we're all drunk, Tammy.
- She didn't mean anything by it.
- I absolutely do mean it.
I totally understand.
I don't blame Greg.
I would leave her too.
I mean, I wouldn't want anything to do with her.
Look at her.
Come on, everybody, people.
Oh...
Look at that.
Ugh.
What?
What?
At least I didn't try to fuck my daughter's husband.
- How'd you know about that?
- Fuck you.
What?
- Always something with her.
- You fucking drunk.
- Okay.
We're having fun.
- All right, let's get the party going.
- Why's everybody being so quiet?
- We gotta go.
Here we go.
What?
What?
All right.
What did I say?
What did I say?
Thank you, Sanne, everybody.
Whoa.
There you are.
I've been looking all over creation for you.
Quite a show you two put on.
I didn't start anything.
Well, you sure finished it, though, didn't you?
What was I supposed to do?
Just stand there while she said shitty things to me?
- It's not fair.
- What the hell does fair have to do with it?
I got a big news flash for you, Tammy.
Life isn't fair.
You're gonna have to scrape and claw for everything you want... just like the rest of us.
You know, for years you've been bellyaching and complaining about how your life sucks... but you haven't done one single thing to make it better.
It isn't magic, you know.
You can't just bitch and moan and expect shit to change.
You think this house just fell on my head one day?
I had to work hard.
You know, gay hasn't always been in fashion, my friend.
Susanne and I...
If you had any idea how hard we had to work...
We didn't have anything handed to us.
You need to grow up, honey.
You don't know anything about me.
You're not that mysterious.
Dogs are mysterious.
Ooh.
Cats.
Birds.
Fish.
Fish are the most mysterious.
And I've made a mint, thank you, Jesus.
But we're not mysterious.
Look, you know... she shouldn't have said all those ugly things.
I agree with you.
But she's drunk.
She won't remember it tomorrow.
Yeah, she's always drunk.
She's an alcoholic, Tammy.
She's sick.
You need to focus on getting your shit together.
Why don't you figure out what it is that you really want and just go after it?
Maybe you can help her out.
I'm gonna go blow up some fireworks.
Suzanne
Takes you down to that place by the river
Suzanne
- Hey.
- Oh!
- Oh, God.
- Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- Why you coming at me, like, out of the dark?
- I was...
I'm sorry, I was just checking on you.
It looked like you were having a hard time out there.
Oh.
She kind of told me I was an asshole and to get my shit together.
Jesus, that's a little harsh.
I'm not so sure that she wasn't right.
Can't exactly keep complaining about my life and not doing anything about it.
Yeah, but you had a hard night with your grandma and everything.
- Yeah, that was great.
- Yeah.
Heh.
I don't know.
I'm the one that let her walk off to the bar with Earl.
I don't know.
I shouldn't have brought Earl here.
I knew it.
But I wanted to see you.
Heh.
Yeah, because I'm such a great catch.
No, it's not that you're a catch.
I mean, I'm not saying you're not a catch.
Just, you know, my life's boring, and you're a very not-boring person.
And, you know, I... it's...
Wow.
You're kind of super bad at compliments.
Like, it's kind of amazing, really.
I'm doing my best, but I think you know what I meant.
I know what you meant.
I don't know.
I don't really think that now... is kind of a great moment for either one of...
You know.
You've got your dad you're chasing after.
And I don't even have a car... or, you know, a job.
You know, I don't think... that putting two messes together is gonna somehow... make an unmess, you know?
I guess I just think you're wrong.
Probably.
I usually am.
Well...
I should probably get out of here... because my dad is now starting... to flash his breasts to the lesbians.
Huh.
Oh, God.
Yeah.
- That's probably your cue.
- So...
Yeah.
- I guess we're goodbye-ing again.
- Yeah.
- Just wanted to mix things up a little.
- All right.
I still think you're wrong, I gotta say.
I can't hear you.
Lenore's blowing shit up.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Morning.
Quite a party, huh?
'Twas, indeed.
Oh.
I'll get in on that.
Thanks for the ass-kicking last night.
No problemo.
- Where's Grandma?
- Outside.
Maybe I'll bring her a cup.
Can we call a truce, or do we have to actually fistfight?
Grandma, I brought you some coffee.
Hey.
Hello?
Grandma, I brought you some coffee.
Grandma?
Grandma?
Grandma?
Grandma.
Grandma.
Grandma.
Come on.
Shit.
Come on, wake up.
Grandma, wake up!
Wake up!
God.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Shit.
Hey!
- She's not breathing.
She's dead.
- What?
- Oh, my God, what?
- She's dead.
Oh, Robin, call 911.
- She's dead.
She's not breathing at all.
- You can't be serious.
What's happened?
She's not breathing, and I just let her drink all night.
- No, no, honey.
It's not your fault.
- It is my fault.
Tammy, it's not your fault.
Oh, my God.
What happened?
Pearl!
Oh, my God!
Oh, God!
Oh, my God, Pearl!
Pearl!
What the fuck?
!
- What the fuck?
- What happened?
Go get her.
- Oh, my God.
- She's not dead.
- on, my God.
- What?
- Sit.
Okay, okay.
- I think she passed out.
- What were you thinking?
- What?
You weren't breathing.
We all thought you were dead.
You are gonna clean your shit up.
You're gonna stop all this drinking.
Do you hear me?
You look terrible.
Well, my feet...
I don't feel so good.
Goddamn it, Pearly.
Nobody should die in a lawn chair.
All right.
All right, don't shake her, don't shake her.
Don't bounce her so much.
Remember, she's not taking all of her pills she's supposed to be taking.
Okay.
Thank you, ma'am.
Did I flash my boobs last night?
- Yeah.
You did.
- Did I?
Yeah.
You were throwing them around last night.
Beep, boop.
All the way.
Yeah, Earl has them all over Facebook.
They look good.
I mean...
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, I was mean...
Oh, I was mean to you.
I called you Cheeseburger.
Oh, my God.
- It's okay.
- Pearly, we'll be right behind, okay?
- It's okay.
It's okay.
- Oh, no.
- We'll follow, okay?
- Yeah.
Oh, shit.
Hey, officers.
Ambulance got here first, but she's gonna be okay.
So don't worry about it.
Thank you, though.
Ma'am, we got reports that someone was burning a Jet Ski on the lake last night.
- You see anything?
- Oh.
Uh, it's super uncool.
I would never burn a watercraft.
- Oh, no.
- No.
No?
We've also been tracking a 2004 Cadillac de Ville... towing a Jet Ski that was involved in a robbery.
Anything on that?
Uh...
You know, uh...
Ooh, wow.
That's a Hawaiian bear shirt.
You don't see a lot of those around here.
You probably see quite a few.
You're gonna have to come with us.
Let's go.
- Oh.
Come on, man.
- Let's go, ma'am.
Stand back, ladies.
Right this way.
I'm going with...
- I bet you see a lot of bear shirts.
- No, no, ma'am.
- Constant.
- Ma'am.
Get...
- Are you serious?
- Ow.
There was a bee.
- There's no bees here, ma'am.
- There was a bee.
You can't run from the law.
Tammy Banks.
On the gate.
See you later.
I hope not.
Hey, Dad.
Tammy.
You rehabilitated?
- I guess.
- Then let's go home.
Wherever that is.
Yeah.
I'm not too happy with Greg.
Yeah, me either.
Look, um... you want me to take care of that wiggly little motherfucker for you?
- What?
- I'll go over there and kill him for you right now.
I'm old.
I don't care if I go to jail.
They got magazines in there, don't they?
Oh.
I thought you were serious for a minute.
Heh...
You're kidding, right?
Jesus, Dad.
You know we're at a prison.
Okay?
I do not want you to hurt Greg in any way.
God.
You know, Grandma told me that she made a pass at you.
Heh.
Oh, yeah, well, she used to hit on everybody all the time.
You know the ice-cream guy, Jerry Miller?
He was the only one who went for it.
Oh, God.
Let's roll.
Mom's waiting.
Oh, God.
You don't have to go in there right now.
Now's a good a time as any.
- Hey, Tammy.
- Hey, Greg.
Come on in.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Well, see you kind of made yourself at home, huh?
Bold.
Uh...
Just wanted to, you know, let you guys know that I'm okay.
You know?
With me.
Not so much what you guys did that's...
I mean, you know, that's really between you... and that guy upstairs.
But I think he frowns on adultery.
I'd say that, so I think you burn, actually.
So I'm just gonna get my stuff.
I, uh...
I folded your clothes.
- So glad you're home.
- Thanks for letting me stay here.
Oh, yeah.
You look good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Prison agree with me?
Heh.
- Heh.
Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.
Think it kind of did.
I got your room all set up so...
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Oh, God.
I'm not bunking with Grandma, am I?
- No.
Heh.
She's at Brookview.
- What?
Did you lock her up?
That is bullshit!
- Give me your car keys, Dad.
- Tammy, wait!
- I'm gonna remember that when you get old.
- Tammy.
Hey!
- Hey, super-old guy, where's Pearl Baizen?
- What?
Oh, God.
Come on, man.
Grandma.
Tammy!
I didn't know you were coming.
Come here, give me a hug.
Look at you.
It's worse than I thought.
Why do you have to go so fast?
All right, everybody.
I'll be back.
I got the car.
Let's go.
- Goddamn it.
Ooh.
- I'll get the door.
You could've killed me.
What are you thinking?
Just stop.
Do you hear me?
Oh, my God.
You can still walk.
Of course I can walk.
I was teaching an exercise class.
Why were you sitting in a wheelchair?
Because most of them are in wheelchairs.
Well, why didn't you tell me you were in here?
I didn't wanna make you jealous.
I mean, you were in jail, and I'm at this cool place.
And my AA meetings are here.
I made friends, and I'm seeing this 84-year-old from Philly.
He was a hockey player, so he seems younger but...
We've been going kind of slow, and this might be the weekend.
Ugh.
You look good.
Thanks.
You look great.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I was afraid to eat the meat in jail, so...
- That's a good call.
- Yeah.
God.
I am so sorry.
So sorry about everything.
I'm sorry.
I was a total jerk to you, and I should've taken better care of you.
No, it wasn't your job to take care of me.
Little bit, it was.
No, I love you so much.
I really do.
Well, I'm pretty great.
You are really great.
I love you too.
We're gonna spend tonight at Lenore's and get up early...
- ...and drive straight to Niagara Falls.
- Call me when you get to Lenore's.
- All right, I will, Mom.
- Don't forget.
- Mom, I've got it, okay?
- Okay, great.
- Stay hydrated.
- All right.
Ah.
Okay.
- Well, thanks for fixing up my car, Dad.
- Oh, not a problem.
- Just don't rob anybody in it.
- I'm not gonna rob anybody in it.
Let's light this candle.
Let's go, woman.
- I got it.
- You're strong.
Ooh.
Dukes of Hazzard-style.
Lenore stocked up the RV, so we're all good to go.
Oh, God.
It's Jerry Miller.
Ladies.
Who wants a bone cone?
- Go, go.
Just go.
- Okay.
Ugh.
So, what do you think, Grandma?
It's a good day to go to Niagara Falls?
I'm ready.
My daddy always said that Niagara Falls is the closest thing to heaven on earth.
Oh!
Sorry.
What are you doing here?
So how'd you know to come here to Niagara, anyway?
A little birdie told me.
- Is the bird named Pearl?
Ha, ha.
- Yes.
So, what's going on with you, Tammy?
What's next?
Thinking about getting my own place in Louisville.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Interesting.
- Yeah, it is.
Isn't it?
Get myself a sweet little place... and, you know, maybe you can come over and watch a movie.
Do you guys feel how the falls are charging the ions?
- It's incredible, right?
- Yes.
- Romantic.
- Yeah, it is.
Oh.
Well, my daddy was right.
It's beautiful here.
Yeah, it's pretty cool.
You think I should try to rent a barrel and try to shoot the falls?
I think we should just look at them, maybe.
- Yeah.
- Really?
I don't know.
I got a good feeling.
I feel like I've been thinking about a course... and if I just shoot out into the middle soft spot there... it'll probably just pillow-carry me right over that Canadian lagoon over there.
I think if anyone could do it, it would be you.
Oh!
Oh.
I thought I saw the Cheetos.
It's not them.
You guys wanna get Cheetos?
- Hey, man.
How you doing?
- Hey.
Good.
- What can I get for you?
- I'm gonna have the iced tea... and then the full rack of the pork ribs.
The full rack, that's a lot of sodium.
You wanna think about going half?
Oh.
Uh, no, I'm gonna get the full rack.
I'm gonna say no.
I'm gonna say let's, together, make a better choice.
How about salmon?
Give you a little cup of BBQ sauce on the side to spice it up.
- Better choice, still got zip.
- I'm just gonna do the ribs.
How's your cholesterol?
- It's a concern.
It's up there, but...
- Oh, Jesus.
- I'm gonna take away the barbecue sauce.
- Oh, man.
All right?
Poom.
You're gonna thank me later.
- I'm gonna fill that up for you.
- Can I...?
I can't believe you're leaving me for that dick.
That dick is gonna have his own franchise in three goddamn years.
What are you gonna do?
Come on, shake a tit.
- Happy hour's over in 20 minutes.
- Aah!
- That's how it's done.
- This is BS.
This is a huge mistake.
You have got to stop yawning so much, Charlotte.
- Are you Keith?
- I'm Keith.
- Aah!
- Poom!
Help me, Charlotte.
You were right.
This hot tub is awesome.
Right?
Yeah.
- So how you liking Louisville?
- I love it.
I love where I live, where I work.
I love the man I lay with.
- It's A-okay with me.
- Great.
Hey, Larry, this sangria is awesome.
Thank you.
The secret's in the maraschino cherries.
Oh.
I see you got a couple of maraschino cherries yourself.
- Oh!
Ha, ha.
- Oh!
Pew.
Pew, pew, pew.
Pew, pew, pew.
Pew.
Pew.
Hey, don't let a deer hit you on the way out.
You dick.
You know what?
You are no longer an employee of Topperjack's.

I need your badge back.

It's a name tag, and you made me buy it with my own money.
That's company policy.
I need it back.
Well, I need you to stop sweating through your shirts and grossing everybody out.

Why are you in my house making my husband dinner?
Uh, actually, I made her dinner.
You're gonna get your ass kicked.
You hungry?
You wanna eat my fist for din...?
Ow!
Shit.
I am so sorry, Tammy.
You startled me.
Keep your dirty fingers out of my mouth.
You scratched my tongue.
I'm leaving you, Greg.
I'm taking the household money and getting out of here.
God!
Nice, Greg!
You have to cheat with the neighbor?
You can forget about me feeding your stupid cats, Missi.

For being an asshole.
That's what I'm suing you for.
Why is there only $63 in here, Greg?
Whatever.

I'm fine!
I feel great.

You know, you never made me dinner.
Not even once.
And it smells really good too.
Yeah, I'll see you in court!
I hope you both choke on your shitty dinner!
Assholes.

What happened?
I went home after a shitty day, and Greg and Missi Jenkins are having, like, a really romantic dinner at our dining room table.
And Greg made it.
Okay, then I'm sorry.
That's terrible.
I'm not exactly thrilled about it myself.
I just need to borrow your car.
Why?
Where's yours?
Mine is smoking on Highway 13 because a deer jumped out in front of me.
Can I just have your car so I can get out of this shitty town?
I will drive you to work.
I'm not giving you my car.
I don't need you to drive me to work, okay?
Keith fired me.
Little prick.
- Are we really gonna do this again, Tammy?
- What?
DEB:
Every time something bad happens, you throw a fit say you're leaving, you never get more than 10 miles outside of town you start feeling sorry for yourself, and you come back and throw another fit.
- That's not true.
- It's a pattern.
It's not a pattern.
- It is.
- That's not even what a pattern is.
A pattern is a thing that comes in pairs of two.
You just don't know science.
A pattern is a series of things or events that repeat themselves on and on, sometimes into infinity.
That's what a galaxy is.
It's not a pattern.

- God.
If you don't wanna help me, just give me the keys to Dad's truck.
- No.
Absolutely not.
- Fine.
Then I'm gonna take Grandma's car.

She is old and not well.
- Then she doesn't need a car.
Right?
You answer that.
- Don't go.

- Grandma, I need your car keys.
Yep, I heard everything, and I am ready to go.

I'm sorry, Deborah, but it is a stupid house.
And I hate it.
I love you, but I am not gonna die in this house alone.
You're not gonna die here alone.
You're gonna die here with me and Don.

I meant it in a good way.

Oh, my God.
You're pregnant.
I'm driving a car, Grandma.
Do you see what I'm doing?
Just because you can't see through your Magoo goggles doesn't mean I'm not doing what I'm doing.

Get in the car.
We're going home.

You can go in the woods.

No way.
TAMMY:
So why do you wanna go to Niagara Falls, anyway?
Well, I was supposed to go with my daddy.
He was gonna take me when I was about 8 or 9.
But he got too busy working.
And then he got too busy getting sick and dying.
- So I never did get to see it.
- Oh.
And now some 60-odd years later I'm gonna get to see Niagara Falls with you, with my granddaughter.
Don't you think that's pretty special?
I think so.
TAMMY:
Are you sitting on a couch or a toilet?
Because this is like a therapy session.

Hey!
Come here!
Yeah?
Look at this thing.
- Do you believe that?
- No.
TAMMY:
- Right?

- Right.
TAMMY:
It's amazing.
America, huh?
- Really, yeah.
- Yeah.
It says he carved it with a chainsaw.
- Do you believe that?
- I do.
I can't believe that's possible.
You do that with a chainsaw and create that kind of artwork, the end.
You just...
I think you should just slam that chainsaw down and be like:
"Look what I did."
Yeah, it's...
It's cool.
It's okay.
- I like it.
- "Okay"?
It's majestic.
- Heh.
TAMMY:
- It's not "okay."
I mean, that is super cool.
You're just jealous.
- Oh, please.
- What've you ever done that's that cool?
- Uh...
- Nothing.
Short list.
I watched Neil Armstrong walk on the moon.
- Wait, on his bike?
- That's Lance.
I don't care which brother it is.
That's still lame compared to this.
Boo.
I had a six-month relationship with one of the Allman Brothers.

Yeah, me too.

Oh, my God.
Did you really have an affair with Gregg Allman?
No.
With Duane.
Who?
Duane Allman.
The brother.
- Did you at least get to meet Gregg?
- Of course.
I got to meet him a lot.
I was on the bus for most of their first tour.
- What?
PEARL:
- Yes.
I have to say that's, like, one of the coolest things anyone in our family has ever, ever, ever done like, going back to when we were cave people.
Probably is, actually.
I never thought of it that way.

PEARL:
Yeah.
Sweetie, it's a great bird.

Yes, we're here.
We found it.
Yep, we're here.
You know what?
I can smell it from the parking lot.
I think you're right.
She says this is the best BBQ in the city.
Then let's have dinner and get off the phone.
Oh, no, sweetie.
We can't.
Thanks.
- We already checked in to a hotel.
- Give me my phone.
Bye.
- We'll see you tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Love you.
Bye.
- Don't hit me.
- What are you doing?
TAMMY:
- Give me my phone.
- We're not going to see Lenore.
- Why?
Because hanging out with an old lesbian is not my idea of a good time.
Oh, don't be silly.
She's an amazing woman.
She's remarkable.
She just lives life.
She just grabs it by the horns.
I mean, you could learn a lot from her.
If you paid attention.
- Are you...?
- What?
- Don't do that.
- What?
- Ugh.
- What?
What are you, gay for Lenore?
